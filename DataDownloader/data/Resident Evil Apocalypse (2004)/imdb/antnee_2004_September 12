If you're looking for the next best picture Oscar winner, then this may
not be your film. It's a Sci-Fi/Action/Thriller/Horror. With characters
you may already know. Ether way, the &quot;good guys&quot; (or more predominately
girls), you have to like. Great special effects and action sequences.
Some clever lines (&quot;Stay!&quot;) that you have to laugh at, and even a token
comedian (GTA, 10 points mother......).<br /><br />Girls in small outfits with big guns, what's not to like (Oh yeah,
there are boys in cool uniforms too for all you girls). <br /><br />This may not be much of a family movie though. There is considerable
violence, graphic gore, language, &amp; nudity.
