Tonight I saw a preview screening of Resident Evil: Apocalypse and am
pleased to say it was everything I had hoped for. While the first film
was entertaining, it struck me as little more than a generic action
film with Resident Evil trappings tacked on, Apocalypse is unmistakably
a Resident Evil movie to its core.<br /><br />One criticism leveled at the first film was the absence of characters
from the games, but Apocalypse is sure to please fans of the video game
series in this regard. Not only does it feature iconic characters such
as Jill Valentine and Nemesis, but more obscure figures such as
Nicholai and Carlos from RE3's Mercenaries bonus game. Angie Ashford is
essentially a renamed Sherry Birkin from RE2. Not only are the
characters present, they're rendered exceptionally faithfully. Sienna
Guillory is a dead ringer for Jill, and Zack Ward is excellent as
Nicholai.<br /><br />Raccoon city is nearly perfect as well. The ruined streets are
extremely evocative of the games, right down to the streetcars. The
Umbrella ads all over the town add to the atmosphere and great pains
have been taken to scout locations reminiscent of memorable scenes from
the games.<br /><br />Of course, all the eye candy in the world won't make a difference if
the movie itself is dreck, but Apocalypse is quite enjoyable. Paul
Anderson's dialogue is a little cheesy sometimes, but never to the
point of annoyance.<br /><br />Alexander Witt gets solid performances from the cast and the movie
never descends into campiness. Fans of the games will be pleased to
know that while the plot doesn't follow the plot of the games strictly,
it does follow it much more closely than the first movie. Along the way
it manages to answer such questions as why Nemesis was so intent on
killing Jill in RE3 and manages to incorporate Alice, who was created
for the movies, into the greater Resident Evil mythos. Best of all, it
manages to portray Umbrella Corporation as the shadowy, creepy entity
it is in the games, giving the sense that there is much more going on
than just in Raccoon City. To top it all off, like Starship Troopers,
Apocalypse gives you the sense that anyone can die any minute... or
worse.<br /><br />Apocalypse isn't perfect. Some of the action sequences are a bit
derivative, Nemesis' makeup is cheesy and it's pretty obvious Raccoon
City is really Toronto (in one shot the CN Tower is visible, and
skyscrapers with the logos of Canadian banks are briefly visible.)
Still, Resident Evil: Apocalypse stands as a decent action film on its
own, and is sure to be a treat for fans of the games.
