As a huge fan of the Resident Evil video-game series, i expected a lot
out of the first resident evil movie, of course, only to be
disappointed. The story didn't have anything to do with resident evil
except from the mansion, and the lab (which was certainly not a complex
named &quot;the hive&quot;.) The zombie action was extremely boring, and the
zombies just looked stupid, and as the gamers know, resident evil is
all about the zombies. OK, since this is APOCALYPSE i wont talk more
about the original movie..<br /><br />OK. After being terribly disappointed by this movie, which i would say
suits best for young teens who just told their friends that they just
saw a great movie named Scream3, i heard rumors of a new resident evil
movie. I searched google for pictures and found a couple of Jill
Valentine. I found a few, and was not disappointed. Se looked just like
the main character of the Resident Evil3: Nemesis video game. Soon i
saw the trailer, COOL!! Nemesis!! i had to watch this movie. I couldn't
wait: Raccoon city, zombie hordes, Jill Valentine, NEMESIS... wow, yet
another disappointment. This movie WORKS as a brainless action horror,
but if you are a huge fan of the games, or have seen a few
monster-action movies before, you are gonna be really bored. Nemesis is
like a doll, except from when hes walking. He ain't got a personality
and is only using a &quot;minigun&quot; until a cheesy fighting scene at the end,
with Alice, yes! Alice! Later in the movie she enters the scene matrix
style and saves Jill and the others, shooting like a terminator. Shes
obviously now a super-lady, programmed to ruin the movie, kick Jill
aside and use kicks and macho comments instead of guns. Pretty much
ruining the movie. Now its not even survival anymore, its catwoman in a
zombie infested city, kicking every things ass... And the bad-guy from
the game, is now a good guy, with the same name.. like that matters to
fans.<br /><br />But as i mentioned, if u haven't enjoyed the games, you will probably
survive(unless you used up the last of your money on this). But if you
want GOOD zombie action without wall-running and super-kicks, you
should watch George Romeros zombie series, and the remake of dawn of
the dead...<br /><br />yes i know i write cheesy ;) but I'm not English
