I just watched Resident Evil: Apocalypse for the second time. I
personally thought it was a very good movie, however, there were a few
things that kinda p*ssed me off. I'm a huge fan of Resident Evil and I
thought the first movie was excellent, definitely better on some levels
than the second. The major flaws in Apocalypse were <br /><br />1. the graveyard scene. wtf? It was just put in the movie to look good,
but anyone who knows anything about RE knows that it was all crap. how
could the dead, decomposing bodies contact the T-Virus, and manage to
stay in one piece long enough to fight? but i must admit, the filming
during the fight scenes was unique and made you feel like you were
actually there.<br /><br />2. the dogs. OK, yea, they were really great in the first movie, but
how did they get the virus in this one? as far as i know, the zombies
didn't go after dogs or any other animal as a food source and in the
first movie, the virus was airborne, so anything in the building
contracted it.<br /><br />3. the filming of the zombies in general, it was just bad. i thought
the way they zoomed in and focused on the zombies in the first movie
was good and they should have stuck with that.but, thats just my
opinion. but aside from those 3 flaws, i thought it was a great movie;
the action and killing never stopped, the special effects were great,
some of the acting was quite good, there were some humorous scenes, and
the ending still left you hanging like in the first one, but it wasn't
as frustrating. I give it **** out of 5
