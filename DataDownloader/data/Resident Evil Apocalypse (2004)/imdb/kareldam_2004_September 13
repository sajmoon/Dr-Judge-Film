if you have played the games and like the idea this is a great movie,
otherwise you might think of it as a little bit over the top. the whole
nemesis project is a bit to much i must admit but it does hold truth to
the game. as a sequel it does a descent job, now being funny at times
even. Mila Jovovich does a good job in portraying the genetically
engineered super bitch. Iain glenn does a worse job in playing the
&quot;evil dokter&quot; somehow it's just not natural. Mike Epps plays the funny
black man and i must admit he really is funny watch for the line; i'm
custom!!. having seen it i wonder how much firepower you need to beat
all the zombies in one city i think the bullet counter went up to 6000
by the end plus a few missiles and grenades off course.
