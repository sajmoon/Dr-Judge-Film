This is by far the worst zombie movie I have seen in a while. It almost
seems as though it was just put together as they were filming without
even using a script... things that make no sense were thrown in left
and right. Why would already dead people get infected and come out of
their graves? I don't get that part at all. horribly unrealistic action
moves were used way too much.<br /><br />I rated this movie a 1 I would recommend watching anything else besides
this movie. try 28 days later, that was a decent zombie movie I can't
imagine how much resident evil 3 is going to suck<br /><br />I don't have anything else to say, goodnight
