The first movie was a well acted and slick horror movie that kept me
entertained.So what&#x27;s there to say about the sequel? Well,it&#x27;s fun and
much more entertaining than the first,in my opinion.There&#x27;s more action
than blood and guts,which makes this movie the perfect popcorn crowd
pleaser.I liked Mike Epps&#x27;s and Oded Fehr&#x27;s performance in the
movie,but the real star is Milla Jovovich who returns as Alice,the hero
from the first movie.The basic plot is this: The Umbrella corporation
unleashes a deadly virus in Racoon City.But this isn&#x27;t just any
virus.It&#x27;s the T-virus,a virus that turns people into
zombies.Well,that&#x27;s it,I guess.Definitely check this movie out.You will
not be disappointed.
