Dumber and more annoying than the first one, Alice now has mental
powers, can walk down walls and has x-ray vision, so she can calculate
the exact moment in which she crashes down a church with a bike right
over two enemies. The cast is as disposable as the one in the first
movie, the direction less obsessed with matrix gimmicks, but equally
easy to forget. The plot is still as interesting as counting cracks in
a wall: citizens trying to escape zombie infested city, yes, Paul WS
Anderson once more makes zombies boring. Talk about having the magic
touch of dullness.<br /><br />Anything else to know? There&#x27;s a token black guy providing comic
relief, a sassy female reporter (and surprisingly this is not a Van
Damme movie) and bad guys with British accents. Every minute that
passes feels dumber and more boring. If you are done with puberty
there&#x27;s no way you could be enjoying this. There are amateur films in
youtube about zombies with more creativity than this derivation of a
dozen of better zombie movies. Also Paul, i know Milla is hot, and your
wife and everything, but she&#x27;s about as good at acting as you are
directing and writing. Stop doing this, for everything that is sacred
in this world, just stop and go back to direct music videos, matrix fan
films or whatever you were doing before trying to make real movies.
