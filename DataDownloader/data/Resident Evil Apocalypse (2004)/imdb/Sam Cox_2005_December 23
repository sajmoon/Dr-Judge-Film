If you find my review of &quot;Resident Evil&quot; you will very quickly discover
I didn't like it. Simply because the director took the ideas and
settings of Resi, and made his own thing. Eliminating gore, suspense
and horror and instead making a lame action film. This film, has more
to do with the Resi franchise, but still comes across as more of an
action film than a survival horror. <br /><br />The film, once again, starts off well, with the threat of the virus
unleashed and Racoon City being evacuated. However, after that, it goes
rapidly downhill. There is actually a lack of zombies in this film
(which is odd considering the city is meant to be full of them)and even
when they're on screen, they're presented in a dull, laggy collage of
moments which is meant to intensify their horrid appearance, but just
makes them boring. <br /><br />The film centres around our main protagonist (super charged naked Milla
Javovich - spelling?) as she is now a super hero and is helping a group
of survivors escape from the city. It is good to see some of the
characters such as Carlos and Jill Valentine appear from the game but
they're characters are never explored and one gets the impression
they're there to look cool and kick butt instead of having actual
depth. But then again, this film has no depth.<br /><br />At the end of the first film, audiences were treated with the
possibility for a sequel involving Nemesis (a rock hard ugly dude in
leather.) In the game, he is a force to be reckoned with and is truly
terrifying and screamingly brutal. In the film, he comes off VERY
cheesy, he is armed to the teeth with explosives and machine guns, and
seems to appear, shoot at our main female, then disappear. Very
disappointing.<br /><br />There are some good moments though, such as making Lickers less
powerful, making for a fairly entertaining shootout in a church (that
is a until an overly dramatised bike scene is introduced), and a school
full of zombie children. Although both these ideas are full of
potential, they're both streamlined into lame action set pieces and
never used to full advantage to creep the audience out.<br /><br />The ending is the worst for the entire film, in which Nemesis joins up
with our heroes to fight the evil Umbrella Corporation. It must be said
that these &quot;teaming-ups by former enemies&quot; is a horrid idea, also
idealised in Aliens Versus Predator (directed by the same guy who made
the first Resi film and also produced this film.)<br /><br />As I stated before, this film is a lame cheesy action flick - not the
survival horror it deserves to be.<br /><br />For the moment, I am hoping there is not a Resi 3 in the pipeline.
