I enjoyed this fast-paced, exciting film very much. The story line is
easy to follow whether or not you've seen the first Resident Evil
(which I have)or played the games (which all of my family have). The
special effects and make-up were all fantastic. I have only one problem
- that the major fight scenes should have had some slo-mo shots which
would have made it easier to follow the action. And though I don't want
to get too picky, there's a scene or two that seems improbable, even in
this science fiction storyline, but I'm willing to go with it anyway.
The main characters were all believable and likable. I was overall very
happy with my movie-going experience, and I'd recommend this film to
anyone who wants to see something action-packed.
