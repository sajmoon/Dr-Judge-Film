Exciting fun ride throughout. It's action with a touch of horror,
crafted to its finest. Make no mistake - this is hardly frightening or
dramatic. Instead, it is heart-pounding entertainment like a Terminator
movie. There's no time to think. You're not even going to be graced
with occasional ruminations over Spider Man's &quot;there's a hero in all of
us.&quot; Instead, RE's scene to scene action will spin you through a wild
mob of zombies, a perilous graveyard, burning car wrecks, a hopeful
helicopter pad, streets full of retreating police, a K-9 unit (Yay!),
people clawing at a prison city wall, an empty-looking schoolyard,...
all the while with guns a'blazin', people a'runnin', and zombies
a'chasin'. The film only allows a pause of silence for the classic
slow-motion whizzing bullets, a bizarre car crash, and moments before
yet another infected creature attacks. Action.<br /><br />If you're the hopelessly logical, then this film is not for you. Your
mind will inevitably wander through thoughts like if STARS knew about
headshots, why didn't they bother giving the Racoon City Police a hint?
Or, hmm...those zombies sure are slow on the ground; funny how they
were just racing up the steps a minute ago. Don't bother. Give the
brain a two-hour break, sit back, and enjoy.<br /><br />If you're the philosophical type, you'll quickly pick up on the
betrayed-by-your-own action/creation theme and smile in understanding
when Nemesis rips out an iron bar for a weapon, leaving a spike where
it broke off. Good theme. But that's pretty much it. What? You came to
a Resident Evil movie to think?! If you're looking for a moral: never
be the guy wearing a helmeted uniform in an action movie.<br /><br />If you're the plot and character development type, you'll instantly
recognize it's pointless since everyone already assumes a clich&eacute; role:
evil villain guy, mercenary badass, deadly girl with gun, laptop
scientist, etc. Why develop more on archtypes you already know? In an
action movie the only development you need is clich&eacute; guy #1 must to
save clich&eacute; guy #2 while everybody gets the F--- Out of Dodge, er,
Racoon City.<br /><br />If you're the horror type, you'll enjoy the priest and how he takes
care of his sister. And oh yes, a scene where a digital camera spies
some children with their hands in the 'cookie jar.' Speaking of
children, Angie Ashford's a little creepy too. There's plenty of horror
&#150; just not as much as 'Dawn of the Dead.'<br /><br />My complaints? It's OK for action movies to have an ultra-powerful
hero, but why god-like? There's no tension and danger when god's
around. Fortunately, they RE characters have a habit of splitting up.
Also, Nemesis wasn't frightening enough. A good dentist can fix his
smile and he could almost pass as a pudgy stuffed animal. Well, except
for the rocket launcher.<br /><br />Rank: Hardly passable for a mystery or drama. But why rank it like
that? I'm not insane. I rank this at 8/10 for an action movie.
