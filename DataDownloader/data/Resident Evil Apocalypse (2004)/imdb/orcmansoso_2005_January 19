Wow, there must not be much in the way of entertainment in Canada,
seeing as how these guys enjoyed this polished turd so much. Oh, and i
am a nerd. one that makes more money than you will ever see in your
pathetic lifetime. This movie is for simpletons that cannot get into
movies with heavy plots, or require too much thinking. Not to mention
that the dialog blew ass. The games to movie's thing never seems to
translate very well to begin with, but these guys just didn't even try
to stick with the story at all. they just tossed everything together
and said; lets just try and make as much money as we can off of this
people! storyline!? what storyline!?, pftt its just a game! How wrong
they were folks, And I'm glad I'm not the only one that noticed this
hack job of a movie!
