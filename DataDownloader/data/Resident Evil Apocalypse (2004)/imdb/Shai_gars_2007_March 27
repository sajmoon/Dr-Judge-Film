OK, this movie didn&#39;t &quot;Break the mould&quot; but its still a great movie...
The action, the story and the the whole &quot;plot&quot; What people have to
realise is that this film isn&#39;t the game and move on... IT&#39;S A FILM!!!!
You can&#39;t bring all the suspense that a game brings because there isn&#39;t
time.<br /><br />People need to understand that in a film, you can&#39;t go off and do
something else, you don&#39;t have the 99 hours of playing time that you
did in the actual game, it has to be placed of certain points.<br /><br />I&#39;m not going to explain all the in&#39;s and outs because they are already
here. but it is a great film with action horror and violence YAY! BRING
ON A THIRD!!!!
