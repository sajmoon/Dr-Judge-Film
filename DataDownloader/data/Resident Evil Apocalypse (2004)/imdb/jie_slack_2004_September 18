After seeing the movie i can't really find one single good thing about.
Well, except that Milla is pretty sexy but that won't save the movie. I
thought RE1 was pretty good, because it was pretty nice filmed, and
edited. However after reading some comments here about RE2 my
expectation were low. Even so, i'm almost surprised how bad it was.
Everything in the movie was totally predictable, from single scenes to
whole plot. Other then that it was poorly shot and edited, with fast
upclose action moves, so fast you never actually see them because they
couldn't have pulled it off otherwise. Also i'm sick and tired of the
&quot;Booo!!&quot; from zombies and monsters...they don't have any effect! And
still they always succeed being dead silent and hidden and suddenly
they are all there screaming in the next camera cut...whats that all
about? <br /><br />1/10
