I thought this was a very good movie! The action was fast paced,
despite the slow moving zombies! Milla is one undead-ass kicking
machine! The ending provided a VERY unique twist for the possible next
chapter of the saga (Alice turns bad?).<br /><br />I also like the introduction of &quot;The Red Queen&quot; incarnate, Angela
Ashford (hey, on the game she has a twin brother Alfred, right? Maybe
that'll be expanded on in the next movie). I liked Jill Valentine being
brought into the fold as well, and the actress who plays her is SMOKING
HOT!!! Mike Epps was hilarious as usual.<br /><br />The one REALLY cheesy part, however, was the familiar &quot;STARS&quot; being
uttered from the Nemisis. But, as far as I'm concerned, it DEFINITELY
worth the price of admission! I'm already waiting eagerly for the next
movie!! BRAVO!
