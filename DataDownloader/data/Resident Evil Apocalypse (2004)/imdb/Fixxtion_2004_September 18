A Movie that entertains . . .? Isn't that what a movie is suppose to
do? Well that's exactly what this movie does. Others may complain about
the lack of award winning movie elements, but I feel this movie was not
designed to win awards. Honestly there are not too many elements in
this movie to comment on, though it does not fail to entertain an
audience. For people who have already turned their back on this movie
from the critical over analyses by the other viewers, keep this in
mind. The movie comes from the world of gaming. In games impossible
chain of events tend to happen out of the blue. This movie is not
limited to &quot;real world&quot; applications, so crazy things will and can
happen. Just sit back and enjoy this movie. It's not based on real
events, at least not from the &quot;real world&quot;, it's based on the &quot;gaming
world&quot;. If you're up for some spooky/action/adventure, go ahead and hit
it up at the theaters.
