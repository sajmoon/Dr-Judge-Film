I&#39;ve always loved the Resident Evil games, and consider myself a true
RE-fan. After watching the first one, which became a complete disaster,
I didn&#39;t know what to expect of this next installment, so I kept my
expectations low - and yet, I was utterly disappointed. This film was
laughable, dumb, badly written, horribly acted, and the effects were
lame. The whole film reminded me of an unpleasant visit at my dentist,
after him having a few drinks; I suppose you get the picture. But all
in all - just to keep myself short - this film traumatized me, and
almost ruined my view upon Resident Evil; luckily, with the games at
hand, I found salvation. Well, to say it as it is - this film (and the
first one as well), made me hurt, mentally and physically, so I&#39;d
recommend people with brains to stay away from it. I learned my lesson;
if you play with fire, you get burned.<br /><br />So, the next time I&#39;ll expose myself to true torment, I think I&#39;ll just
stab myself in the eyeball - It will be less painful than ever watching
this complete piece of trash, which name is - dare I say it - Resident
Evil Apocalypse.
