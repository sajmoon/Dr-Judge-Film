OK, I realize that I am not the target demographic for this movie. I&#39;m
not young, and I&#39;m not a video game geek. I have not seen the first
&quot;Resident Evil&quot; film, nor have I played (or even heard of) the video
game. So, I am coming at this film from a sci-fi action flick
direction. While the movie largely fails at this, it really could have
been a lot worse. Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory were decent enough
as the tough-girl video-game-type heroines. Somebody named Mike Epps
tried to play the clich&eacute;&#39; smart-ass black guy part. The best acting
came from Sandrine Holt, as the TV reporter trapped in the nightmare.
There were huge plot holes, as you might expect. Seem to me that this
one is worth skipping, but isn&#39;t terrible.
