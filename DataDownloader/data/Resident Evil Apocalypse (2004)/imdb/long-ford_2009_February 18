This film manages to be worse than it&#39;s mediocre predecessor. Although
the plot is good, the film&#39;s execution is terrible. In an effort to
mimic a video game, the action scenes are blurred and incoherent with
split second edits rendering everything incomprehensible. In fact, I
ended up with a headache. The Special Effects remain decent however,
and (MINOR SPOILERS) a secret weapon called Nemesis is an impressive
creation. There are a few scant suspenseful scenes and Jovovich barely
manages to leave an impression. This film can be seen only with a
finger ready on the fast forward button.<br /><br />Overall 3/10
