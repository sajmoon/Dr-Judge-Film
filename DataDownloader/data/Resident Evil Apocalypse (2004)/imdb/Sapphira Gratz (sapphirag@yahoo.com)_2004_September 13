Let me preface by saying I enjoyed the first Resident Evil movie and I
also enjoyed the game. They were pure scary zombie fun for me, with
cool special effects and make-up. If you did not like the first movie,
than please don't see the second because it is much more gratuitous in
it's violence and gore. Which is just what I expected! <br /><br />So I liked this second film. It's made for those with an extreme short
attention span, and the action is beyond quick. There is truly nonstop
violence and gore - and I'm not complaining. Occasionally I like those
kind of films, and this one delivers.The best part for me is Nemesis -
he looks cartoonish but he's pure fun to watch. Again the true star is
Jovovich and they make her as cool as ever which I also can't help but
like. I thought the make-up and and over-the-top explosions were
actually an asset to the film as that is exactly what I had wanted when
I went to see it.<br /><br />Want brainless movie fun? Enjoyed the first Resident Evil movie? Than
I'd recommend this movie to you.
