A bit different then the first movie.<br /><br />Resident evil was a good movie with a few problems.<br /><br />This is one of those movies where they do big stunts and unbelievable
things when they could have just done something simple to get out of
the problem thats going on in the movie.<br /><br />This time around it is much different then the first movie. There is
more monsters, much more action and of course new characters.<br /><br />With a bigger plot this movie really takes it up a notch. There was
more gore and more violence.<br /><br />But it wasn&#39;t better then the first one.<br /><br />I recommend it to people who have seen the first one. I didn&#39;t mind it.
I think the fans will love it.<br /><br />5/10
