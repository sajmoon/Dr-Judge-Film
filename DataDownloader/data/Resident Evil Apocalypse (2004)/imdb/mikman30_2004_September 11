Not sure what they were thinking here, but the story was very lame and
the acting was very stiff. The story basically consisted of trying to
find the daughter of a Umbrella Co. Scientist and the test launch of
the Nemesis project. The Nemesis Project was the genetic tinkering they
did with the 2 survivors from RE1. The whole problem with this is that
they did not explain much about the whole project. Also, the Jill
Valentine actress was very stiff and the black guy that got whacked by
Nemesis was stupid. The movie did make me jump a few times, but overall
I was very disappointed, as I liked the first movie a lot. It just
seemed to have way many more interesting action scenes and a 100%
better ending. I don't think they could really end this movie all that
well because they had a bad story to build up to a climax. Oh well, I
'd like to say they should end the RE series now, but maybe they'll do
better next time. Until then, save your money and rent it in 2 months
because this movie won't be out for very long.
