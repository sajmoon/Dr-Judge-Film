Resident Evil: Apocalypse<br /><br />Picking up where resident evil left off.<br /><br />Alice wakes up in the raccoon city hospital only to find the city is
infected by the T- Virus. The city in chaos by the legions of undead
residents of raccoon city, infected by the T- virus from the hive.she
forms a loose relationship with some of the survivors and battle's her
way through the city trying to locate a Doctors daughter who's hiding
in the school. in exchange he will get them out of the city alive. also
finding herself has been &quot;enhanced&quot; to be stronger, faster, smarter and
with more endurance. She also confronts the monster &quot;nemesis&quot; developed
by the umbrella corporation. I thought the movie was very action packed
but felt that they would get a clue as to how to drive off the undead
by shooting them in the head instead of the body. The movie, to me,
showed just how bad and ruthless the umbrella corporation was really is
by shutting the gate and then nuking the city to cover all trace and
having a cover story about a nuclear reactor melt down. I believe there
will be another movie in the works to see what further enhancements the
umbrella corporation has made to Alice.
