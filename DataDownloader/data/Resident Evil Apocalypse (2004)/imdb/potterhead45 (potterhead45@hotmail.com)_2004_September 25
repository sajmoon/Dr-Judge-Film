As a devoted Resident Evil fan for nearly five years AND former member
of residentevilfan.com's &quot;Caption This&quot; game, I can safely say that
this movie rocked.<br /><br />I loved all the explosive action and funny dialogue. I personally
thought it was a clever idea to make an &quot;alternate version&quot; of Resident
Evil 3. All the special effects looked superb and realistic. And the
parody of the Code Veronica intro towards the end was great. I even
went the movie dressed up as Albert Wesker! All in all, great action
flick, go out and see it, long live Resident Evil, and (to the
filmmakers) make a third one already!!!
