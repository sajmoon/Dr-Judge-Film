This film was fantastic! From a technical level, as good looking a film
as I have ever seen. The editing and pacing is breathless. The sound
design was coming from everywhere in the theater. Relentless action. As
exciting a film experience I've had since 1986's &quot;Aliens&quot;. But also as
much loopy zombie fun as 1985's &quot;Life Force&quot;. A true new modern classic
and dare I say it, One of the best films of 2004. Milla Jovovich
running lost in a deserted city as every pay telephone on the street
starts to ring is a new classic moment in modern cinema. Man, the
majority of the film critics miss the boat on this one.<br /><br />Hope George Romero's up coming &quot;Land of the Dead&quot; packs the same
kinetic style as this trippy flick.
