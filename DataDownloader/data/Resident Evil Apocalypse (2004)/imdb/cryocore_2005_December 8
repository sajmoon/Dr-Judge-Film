First off let me say I am a horror geek. And add to that a zombie nerd.
My fave film of all time is Braindead, and my top 5 include the 4
Romero Dead films.<br /><br />OK now thats over let my tell you of my hate of the trash known as
Resident Evil: Apocalypse.<br /><br />Its awful.<br /><br />Fist up the acting, wooden at best, aggravating at its worst. Some
scenes play like an amateur porn flick before the sex kicks in.<br /><br />The Story is beyond abysmal, and is simply beyond stupid, it lacks
cohesion or any development of plot or characterization.<br /><br />Sound is actually good, well mixed and crisply presented. The low end
is perhaps a bit wooden, and the high end too sharp, but the surround
is just about perfect.<br /><br />The direction is cookie cutter stuff, with every trade clich&eacute; finding
its way in somewhere, the framing show a lack of imagination.<br /><br />The editing is crude, with sloppy jump cuts and bad pacing. The film
could have been 15-25 minutes shorter and lost nothing in atmosphere.
It feel rushed and further weakens an already damaged product.<br /><br />The fx are OK and some are impressive, but mostly they are a sad
attempt at bringing life to a corpse of a film that really needed to be
buried, and is just stinking up the place.<br /><br />My major irk with the movie is that it isn't scary, or gory, or
suspenseful, all the things the game is known for, and things that
horror is known for. Instead we get a weak action film so dumb that
only the lowliest smacktard could possibly enjoy it (i.e if you like
Uwe Boll this is the movie for you).<br /><br />I hate this film for what it should have been.<br /><br />There are worse ways to waste a couple of hours but I cant think of any
right now.<br /><br />If you like horror skip this film, it will only annoy you. If you like
action, skip it will only disappoint you. If you like film skip it, as
it will only astound you at its ineptitude.<br /><br />1 out of 10 only Uwe Boll could make a worse horror film.
