Resident Evil 2 in a word... is 'good'. Compared to the recent rash of
Zombie Movies out this century this is one of the best.<br /><br />It is better than the original RESIDENT EVIL film in terms of direction
and visuals although the story was a little predictable, even if you
have not played any of the games.<br /><br />The acting was so so, however Milla Jovovich's performance is good. I
think it is about time she started acting in serious films and not JUST
silly sci-fi kids films {as i recall she put in an excellent
performance in Spike Lee's classic HE GOT GAME).<br /><br />This film does not have the intellectual punch of 28 DAYS LATER and
NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD nor the humour and irony of the forthcoming
SHAUN OF THE DEAD. However you will find Resident Evil 2 much more
entertaining than the dull remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD that came out a
few months ago.<br /><br />This film does not try to be anything but pure entertainment...and it
works. The film recognises that premise of Zombies taking over the
world as being so far fetched and implausible that it is impossible to
take seriously. So instead of trying to just shock you with gallons of
blood and pig guts (like the Dawn Of The Dead remake} this gets a bit
more shylock in its approach and gently laughs at it self and while
trying to take you on an entertaining roller coaster of a ride.<br /><br />Resident Evil 2 is the 'HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL and 13 GHOSTS of the
zombie genre
