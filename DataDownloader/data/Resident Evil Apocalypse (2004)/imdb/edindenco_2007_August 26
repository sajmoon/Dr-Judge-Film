Zombies........ means don&#39;t watch it. Or so i thought. Ever since Night
of the living Dead was released ages ago, I have never liked Zombie
Movies........ Till now that is. The only two reasons I watched this is
Milla Jovovich and the $3.00 DVD price<br /><br />I watched the special features DVD first. i do this, as it makes all
movies more enjoyable I had no clue this Movie was based on a Video
Game when I bought it. No comparing here of one to the other. This
stands alone as good fun to watch. The last time a Movie made me jump
or flinch was the Godfather way back in 72. The sound man in this Movie
has his s**t together. you are in la la land and then all of a sudden
as John Madden would say &quot;B o o M&quot;. Can&#39;t wait for the 9.27.07 release
of #3. Activate Alice Program...........Thanks for reading my review.
Feel free to scream at me or praise my review at edindenco@netzero.com.
Bye for now.
