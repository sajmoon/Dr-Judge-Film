The first Resident Evil is one of my guilty pleasures. I really enjoyed
the movie, even with it's bad acting and simple story. Being a fan of
the original game, I felt that the movie captured the feeling of the
video game and basically that was my entire expectation going into the
theatre.<br /><br />The video game started in a mansion where you played as a member of
S.T.A.R.S. Either you played as Chris or Jill Valentine. The first
movie followed the basic concept of a place where the Umbrella
Corporation was conducting genetic experiments that went wrong. While
the first film added the character Alice, instead of the game's
characters, it was decently filmed and I find myself watching it from
time to time. Like I had said, one of my guilty pleasures.<br /><br />The second movie (Apocalypse) basically follows a large portion of the
second video game. The second video game you can play as either Chris
and Jill again and you have to escape Racoon City while a super
creature (nemesis) is tracking you down. The second film takes Alice on
this adventure, while adding some interesting supporting members to her
group. The second film also brings the original character, Jill
Valentine, into the fold. There are quite a few new ideas introduced
into the movie that were not in the game storyline, but they are
interesting. Apocalypse has decent acting (think popcorn adventure
movie, not Oscar), a decent script (except for the last 10 minutes),
and a few decent well done horror moments. Apocalypse is better than
the original (I know some of you may think that would not take much),
and I see it falling under another DVD purchase I find myself watching
time and time again. <br /><br />The only disappointment was in the last moments of the movie. The big
bad corporating scene was just -- well, it has been done too many times
and did not need to be done again. The end scene with Alice is a
typical sequel setup that also did not need to be done. <br /><br />Milla Jovovich kicks ass, ala Laura Croft, without trying to act.
Something Angelina Jolie tries too hard to do and fails at miserably.
Milla plays Alice via the way a male action star would play a Rambo or
a super cop. Because of the way Milla approaches Alice, it works.<br /><br />Oded Fahr is the best part of the movie. Fans may remember him from the
Mummy series as the Templar Knight. Fahr is a scene stealer and a very
pleasant addition to the cast.<br /><br />Sienna Guillery is just there as Jill Valentine. The kick ass
character, from the games, takes a back seat to Alice and never is
fully developed. Whenever Fahr or Milla are in the scenes, Guillery
gets lost in the mix. Guillery is still hot to look at though (same as
she was in Troy as Helen) and I had to laugh at the tight (very
non-police) uniform that she struts around within. <br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this film. While I really liked it, I am not sure
what anyone else would think. I enjoy these kind of horror/action
films: Resident Evil, Dawn of the Dead, Army of Darkness, 28 Days, and
the Omega Man. If you are a fan of those types of films, I believe you
would enjoy Apocalypse.
