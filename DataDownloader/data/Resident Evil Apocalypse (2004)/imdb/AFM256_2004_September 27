Had some good surprises and some good 'little guy' heroes parts. I'd
say certainly worth a store rental, but not sure that it's worthy of a
full fare price at the theaters. It seemed like it had the ideas right
but was just barely missing that edge to make it a really good
thriller/ horror flick about gene warfare gone batty. Perhaps they
covered more of that in Res1...still seemed like they could have delved
into the belly of the beast a bit more...like giving someone on the
outside a conscience.<br /><br />I thought the Zombies were a bit lame. Not menacing as a group - though
there were certain close-ups that worked well. They just looked like
sorta badly made up bicycle accident victims that were poorly directed.
What's frightening about an opponent that travels at 1/4 speed? Right
up there with dolls that can take down an adult, ya know? When the
action did get heated it seemed like there were too many cuts - no flow
to the fight scenes.<br /><br />Don't look to close or expect there to be much logic in the plot line.
Entertaining, but not as entertaining as Van Helsing on any level.
