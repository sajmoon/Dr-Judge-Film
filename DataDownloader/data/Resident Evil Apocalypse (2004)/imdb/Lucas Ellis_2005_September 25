The Ubrella Crporation created a virus that reactivates dead cells and
brings people to life or what you could call life. Alice(Milla
Jovivich) finds herself in a hospital of a Raccon City which has been
totally infected with the virus and is the habitat for an army of
walking zombies. She must fight with others to escape not only the
zombies but The Umbrella Corporation's cover up and a super-zombie
called Nemesis.<br /><br />Althoug the movie was not very well made, it was still very
entertaining. I really didn't see any artistic value with the way it
was made but I did find the story(based from the games) very
interesting and the special effects to be very well done. I don't
understand how zombies could come out of the ground when you have to be
bitten to be infected though! The Nemesis also looked extremely lame
and I could do without the corny writing but besides all of those
really cheesy parts, the movie would have earned a recommendation.
Overall, just take the movie for what it is and you could very well be
entertained or you could just be disappointed. Unfortunately, I was
disappointed.<br /><br />I do not recommend this movie.
