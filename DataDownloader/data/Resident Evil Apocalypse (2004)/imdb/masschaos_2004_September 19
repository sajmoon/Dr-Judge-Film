 From the trailer you could tell this wasn't going to be an Oscar-worthy
masterpiece (might win a few Razzies though) so anyone who went to see
this as anything more than mindless entertainment obviously can't
interpret movies well! This one was a typical &quot;B&quot; movie, and no one
should expect more than that; vapid predictable story; comic relief
black guy, and the quintessential &quot;BATCH&quot;... throw in a few dozen
Marlboro men and add a hint of pseudo-suspense and the &quot;B&quot; movie
recipe's complete. <br /><br />I spend most of my time studying or working on my computer, so when I
do manage to go to a movie I like to let my brain rest for a while. I
thoroughly enjoyed this movie for providing a brief respite from my
mundane &quot;life.&quot; Nice action, a good pace that'll get your blood
pumping, and good acting... don't take this movie really seriously, and
don't expect anything extraordinary, and you'll enjoy this movie!<br /><br />My only fault with it was the casting of Milla Jovovich as Alice, not a
bad actor, just not buff enough to be believable as a major booty
torquer!
