I can recall the first time that I watched this film, that it was quite
frightening for me, but soon after watching it, I wised up and realized
that it was a rollicking good time, chock full of killings,
destruction, a set of trigger-happy characters, and evil dead with no
remorse. This film centers around Alice, the former head of security
for Umbrella corporation, the corporation that is the biggest for
anything in the world. <br /><br />It seems that Umbrella, with their many areas of marketing, decided to
test a new form of biological warfare, which killed many people, with
the exception of the not exactly staying dead... With this, Alice was a
survivor of this heinous disease, and set out to kill the evil dead,
but while she did, more infected people came about killing more people,
and with this, armed survivors had set out to get out from the city
chock full of the evil dead, lest they get destroyed with the undead
populace when it gets &quot;wiped clean&quot;<br /><br />All in all, this is a very good movie! I highly recommend it to those
who enjoy a good scare.
