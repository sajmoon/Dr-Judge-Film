This is not a bad movie, especially considering that&#x27;s a sequel of an
already not so great movie. &#x22;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&#x22; is a good mix
of horror, action and science-fiction elements but still makes some odd
choices with its story.<br /><br />Biggest problem with the movie is that it has too many separate story
lines with many different characters that don&#x27;t really have anything to
do with each other. In fact, in the first halve of the story the main
character Alice, played by Milla Jovovich, is hardly used in the movie.
The movie tries to follow too many characters, it doesn&#x27;t make the
movie confusing but it does make this movie a bit odd and uneasy to
watch at times. The movie doesn&#x27;t always flow and despite its potential
the story makes some odd choices.<br /><br />Again the movie has some good action and as a Zombie movie it also
certainly isn&#x27;t a bad movie but still the movie has an awful B-movie
feeling over it at times. The actors (I really like Thomas Kretschmann
as an actor but he was terribly miscast in this movie and simply didn&#x27;t
fit the part) and their dialog is horrible and the movie has some at
times horrible editing and use of slow-motion. It also again &#x27;borrows&#x27;
too many elements from other more successful movies. It isn&#x27;t exactly
the most original movie to watch. Still there are some good elements in
the movie, such as with the Nemisis character, that is one big cool
villain with some serious heavy weaponry.<br /><br />A different director and writer would had certainly done some good to
this movie. The movie had quite some potential but it isn&#x27;t used to the
max and there had been made some odd choices with the movie its story.<br /><br />Still I say; Bring on part three!<br /><br />6/10<br /><br />http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/
