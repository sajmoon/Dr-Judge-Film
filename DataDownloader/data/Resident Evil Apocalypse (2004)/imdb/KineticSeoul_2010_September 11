This is a really silly zombie flick that tries to be serious for the
most part. Much more silly than the first movie in this series and
there is way more plot holes, with more corny kung fu fighting. Yeah
there is more action in this one compared to the previous one, but
doesn&#x27;t have hardly any of the survival horror elements like the first
one and the plot is just stupid. Yeah it has Jill Valentine walking
through dark corridors and checking rooms, but that is about it. The
only positive thing I can say about this sequel is how it&#x27;s dumb to the
point it is sometimes more entertaining for few parts compared to the
first one. And showing two girls with guns in the first one was hot,
but it&#x27;s a bit more hot in this one because of Sienna Guillory who
plays Jill Valentine who is one of the characters from the actual video
games. And how it has a little bit of the similar aspects to Resident
Evil 3 Nemesis. The plot is very simple, a group of people are trying
to escape Raccoon City after a infection spread that turn the civilians
into zombies, and zombies aren&#x27;t the only thing they have to watch out
for a giant monster nemesis and a nuke that is planned to blow up the
whole city is on there way. As silly as it is, Alice this time around
has special abilities from getting injected by the T-Virus instead of
turning into a zombie herself. The side characters are way much more
annoying this time around, you know those morons that doesn&#x27;t stick
with the group and goes &#x22;I can&#x27;t take it anymore&#x22; and tries to leave
where it&#x27;s safe and gets the whole group into trouble. The plot this
time around also almost has nothing to do with the game, same can be
said about the future installments of this movie series. The first
movie also had a lot of silly techno and rock action, but this one
overdose that as well. Sure the creators try to add a lot of cool
action sequences into this, but almost nothing about it makes sense at
all.<br /><br />5.2/10
