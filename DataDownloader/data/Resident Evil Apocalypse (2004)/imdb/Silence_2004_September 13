Fun with evil corporations. Kick ass females, Mind control, tons of
skin. It's all there, everything I like. And yet &#133; I am left wanting.
Maybe it's Leloo, maybe it's me, but I never got the connection with
the movie that drew me in deep. Fun and action, yes. Monsters and super
beings, sure. Truly evil corporations and doctors, I can buy all that.
But at some point I hope to be so drawn into the experience of the
movie that I forget my self in the theater and live in the world where
all these things are possible. Maybe I have too high of expectations,
but I don't think so.<br /><br />Things I liked: women and guns - impossible speed - the coming
apocalypse done right - bad doggies - CGI tongues - Alice is back in
the lab 4 upgrades and is way more powerful.<br /><br />Things I had difficulty with: The dead in their graves awaken, if the
premise is a virus, how does it get to them - dad gets shot and then
becomes a zombie and goes after the evil corporate guy, where was the
infection - the Nemisis beast was not that scary or much of a power to
fear.
