Normally, I don't post my thoughts on movies that I found to be utter
trash. But with this one, I couldn't help. I guess you could say I'm on
a crusade to keep people away from this movie, fearing it will cause
incredible damage to our already Hollywood-ized society. In all
honesty, I went into this movie with little hope. The first Resident
Evil was not good by any means. But it did have some, and I mean very
few, good sequences here and there. I was hoping this, the second film
in the franchise, might be a tad better. Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />This is easily one of the worst sequels to have come out of mainstream
Hollywood in quite some time. Sounds harsh huh? Well, it's something
you have to see to believe. There is honestly nothing redeeming about
this movie. The acting is dreadful. They all sound like they are
auditioning for a bad daytime soap opera. It's flat and forced. The
direction is uninspired. No, it's not even mediocre. Anderson's
direction in the first was at least decent in some areas. Now however,
his companion Alexander Witt takes the reigns and the results couldn't
be worse. I found myself actually wishing Anderson had directed this.
That's not a good thing either.<br /><br />Of course, Anderson still wrote the movie. It shows. This man shouldn't
be allowed to touch a screenplay, ever. The dialogue is horrible. The
characters have nothing to them. The plot, well, it doesn't have one.
There's no build up to anything. There's not one character we as an
audience can care about. I found myself hoping everyone in the movie
would die so it could end. Even the action is terribly written and
shot. It's almost so clich&eacute; that it spoofs itself. It's overblown,
unexciting, been there done that, peppered with metal music to
&quot;highten&quot; the action.<br /><br />To get this out of the way also. I don't mind mindless action movies,
but when the action isn't even worth watching what's the point?<br /><br />This of course brings me to another point being a horror fan. This
movie is not scary, one bit. It's a bunch of &quot;boo&quot; scares that occur
every five seconds. It gets real old, real quick. Just like the rest of
this absolutely awful film. Stay away at all costs unless you like
punishment and a movie that lowers your intelligent. 1/10.
