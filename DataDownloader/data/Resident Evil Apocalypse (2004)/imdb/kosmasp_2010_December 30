While the setting could remind many of the old Western movies, it does
pack quite a bit of action in here. And therefor makes it more
straightforward then the first movie. It also is picking up where the
first one left us off. So it does make sense, to watch the first
Resident Evil movie. You do not have to have played the games though.
Though there are characters in here, that you might have seen or heard
of, if you did, it also offers things, that have not been handled in
the game series at all! <br /><br />Milla is joined by some other people and we do have a &#x22;funny man&#x22; in
here too. So there is some comic relief after all (if that was the one
thing, you were missing in the first movie). On the other hand, it is
far more lighter, because of the absence of any real story. You&#x27;ll
either think this is a good thing or not, but it is the way it is.
