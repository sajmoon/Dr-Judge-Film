first of all Resident evil: apocalypse was a ass-kick movie, the thing
i can say on this movie is 1st-its way better than the first one. 2nd-i
rate it 8.5 the right stuff that Paul Anderson did: almost all the
original characters from the game &quot;resident evil 3:Nemesis&quot;, the
location is in a city which gives a view what is Raccoon City, Anderson
added some elements from resident evil:2 and resident evil:outbreak
games, overall he made a movie for the people to enjoy the wrong stuff
that Anderson did:HE CREATED A NEW CHARACTER THAT MAKES ME THINK WHATS
WRONG WITH HIM! ITS LIKE HE DID NOT HAVE GUYS TO TELL HIM WHAT HAPPENED
IN THE GAME(game experts or guys from capcom or the creators of
Resident evil itself!!!!!), he altered the ending of the movie because
its supposed to be &quot;jill vs. Nemesis&quot; not &quot;alice vs. Nemesis&quot;, he also
altered the the place for the final fight because it was done in a
helipad that it is supposed to be in the &quot;dead factory&quot;(in the game),
there should be no school in the movie, Dr. Ashford should be Dr.
Willaim Burkin,and his daughter &quot;Angie&quot; should be Sherry or Shirly(i
don't know which is correct), he should combined a movie between
resident evil: 2 and 3 so the movie will be quite longer. well thats it
