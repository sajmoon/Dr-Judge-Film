Even being a huge fan of zombie movies and the first 2 Resident Evil
games, I found this film confusing and boring. I really think it is one
of the worst films I've ever seen. I found it hard to believe grown
adults had produced something so bad.<br /><br />My main problem was the sheer number of characters we are expected to
keep track of given their limited screen time, and the fact that the
first half of the film skips around all over the place. We had Jill
Valentine, her partner (can't remember his name), some reporter woman
(cant remember her name either), some stereotypical wise cracking black
gangster and a building full of STARS members . Then there was the
Umbrella soldiers with European sounding names (3 of them I think),
Alice, the Nemesis, The evil boss (complete with bad German accent),
The mad professor and his daughter. most of these characters are
running around Racoon City, trying to find the mad professors daughter
in order to bargain a safe route out (or hinder the efforts of those
that are). There is no sort of character development to at least clue
us in on their backgrounds or motivation, let alone even care when they
get killed!<br /><br />Another problem I had was that the zombies (which should be the main
point of the film) seem almost peripheral - there is no sense of horror
or dread in any of the zombie scenes. <br /><br />The plot is so rushed and patchy that all we are left with are a
collection of clich&eacute;d action set-pieces that could have been from any
John woo inspired action film from the last few years. The story simply
exists as a device to join these set pieces together.<br /><br />Truly appalling. Watch it at your own risk.<br /><br />1 out of 10
