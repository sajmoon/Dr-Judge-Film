Okay, one might wonder why I am watching the second part after my
negative comment on the first part. The only explanation I can give is
quality time with my family and to watch two hot chicks (Guilory and
Jovovich) fight zombies. Perhaps I may be somewhat curious to how the
story continues.<br /><br />&#39;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&#39; is worse than its prequel. There is hardly
anything that makes this one different from other viral films. It&#39;s
filled with clich&egrave;s and obvious jumps (again most of it is
unintentionally funny, or maybe it&#39;s not so unintentional). Here the
story revolves around two pretty (and smart) women and a couple of
idiots against zombies. Of course the ending is also such that another
sequel is expected (and it&#39;s been released already).<br /><br />In terms of acting, Jovovich performed better in the previous one. Here
she&#39;s more in Tomb Raider mode (but she does act better than Angelina
Jolie did in Tomb Raider). The special effects aren&#39;t so bad either.
Other than that I find &#39;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&#39; funny too. Now I am
curious about the 3rd part and to see how Jovovich continues her Tomb
Raider-like war against the zombies...and of course to have a nice time
with my family (who seem to enjoy it a lot).
