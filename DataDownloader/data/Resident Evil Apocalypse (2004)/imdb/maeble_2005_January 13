This movie is just one of a million bad action flicks around. It has
absolutely nothing worth talking about. There is no interesting idea,
or plot, that could save it. And!...can anyone tell me why there has to
be always this awful drunken like camera in the action scenes? To show
the hectic, pace of the fights? In fact you can't understand anything
that's going on!<br /><br />The few good scenes and ideas are directly stolen from the
alien-movies,..the rest is just standard-meaningless-brainless action
movie (not considering, that it should have been a horror movie). <br /><br />A real disappointment!
