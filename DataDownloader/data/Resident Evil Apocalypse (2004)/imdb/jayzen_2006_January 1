This would probably have to be one of the worst movies I have ever
seen. All dialogue (except milla's monologues) was ridiculously stupid
with some characters even dying after their action hero one liners. In
terms of storyline progression and character introduction this seems to
have completely missed the point. I cannot even begin to explain why i
hate Jill Valentine.<br /><br />The change in directors has played a big role in the demise of this
movie. In fact i doubt that Paul Anderson has even bothered to watch
the first movie. The camera jerks around wildly and I wouldn't be
surprised if there was some secret competition among inadequate
directors to see who could change angles most often.This is neither
scary nor that great on Action.<br /><br />This is my first Comment about a movie on IMDb but this had to be said.
If you liked the first movie don't watch this.
