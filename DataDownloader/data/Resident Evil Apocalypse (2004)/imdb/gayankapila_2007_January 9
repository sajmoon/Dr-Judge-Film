An Amazing &amp; A Decent Horror , Action ,Thriller Movie better than i
thought it would be ... i thought this is much as the same as resident
evil part 1 but its not maybe the best Horror , Action ,Thriller i
watched in my life ... maybe before u watch this one i recommend u
watching the part 01 even though its not that good as this (but part 01
is fine with me too) it will help u understand the full storyline ...
but it wont be necessary for the ppl who got a good knowledge about the
movies like this or for the ppl who had played the pc game or the
playstation games etc. even though there&#39;s a preview of Alice (Milla
Jovovich) explaining everything that happened in movie one with some
brief introductions and videos from part 01 ....<br /><br />best performances by Milla Jovovich (as Alice) and Sienna Guillory (as
Jill Valentine) i really liked the performances of Matthew G. Taylor
(as Nemesis) ... the sound effects of the movie makes u go up on Ur
seat if Ur using Dolby surround ...<br /><br />the shooting performances are off the hook ... i really needed that gun
which the nemesis carries in one arm .... and the rocket launcer too
lol ...<br /><br />do not buy any dvds which got the camera copies of the movie and make
sure it is widescreen DVD which u can watch it in full screen on Ur pc
or Ur TV ... and make sure the sounds are up ... sit back and get ready
for some action with a mix of thriller and horror ...<br /><br />good job done by the directer Alexander Witt ... i give 10 / 10
resident evil 2 appocalypse ...
