It could have been way way better, there is not horror enough for my
liking and with a title of RESIDENT EVIL it should ooze horror and
tension and thrills. It doesn't what we get instead is a bunch of
action scene's thrown together really fast. Which spoils it in a way
because of the p*ss poor editing, it is cut too quick. Not giving us
enough time to gaze upon the undead and that is a big mistake indeed.<br /><br />Take a certain scene involving a Priest and his sister, well you don't
get enough time to see the zombie in that scene. It is cut too damn
quickly, as if the fools wanted to give you glances of it instead of
one or two decent shots of it's face. Which might i add would have been
pretty damn good if that would have happened instead of the p*ss poor
editing we got in it's place.<br /><br />Other scene's involving jovobitch fighting zombies, i thought it would
have been crap. It wasn't but then again it wasn't anything special
either and YET AGAIN in the graveyard fight, it was cut to damn
quickly. Not enough time to look at what was going on around them, 2
seconds showing us one thing then another 2 seconds showing us another
thing etc etc.<br /><br />All the poor editing is the fault of the director, him wanting it this
way and that. Fool that he is, doesn't he know how to cut a movie
properly, oh wait all he has ever been linked to is mainstream action
movies NOT HORROR. Which will explain yet again why this movie ISN'T
HORROR and is cut like a mainstream action flick.<br /><br />There is only two stand out characters in this movie, The Black Guy who
runs around the streets for a while before bumping into Jill. And Jill
who is &quot;the real main Resident Evil character&quot; not that poser
jovobitch. These two characters are the only one's remotely likable in
the entire movie, i was starting to like Carlos and Nicholai but didn't
care too much for them really blame those who made it.<br /><br />Carlos couldn't have been farther from the character if he tried, he
didn't feel like him in anyway what so ever. Nicholai is around 40 or
so years of age, white hair etc and yet Nicholai in the movie is the
same age as Carlos and doesn't have white hair wft?. That in a way
could have been acceptable but not giving them enough screen time etc
is typical anderson script trash at it's best. He'd rather give screen
time to that thing that's supposed to be the main character of the
movie series. Rather than give it to REAL RE characters, i will leave
it at that as i am starting to get p*ssed off here.<br /><br />The movie despite all the lame as hell editing, it had one or two
promising moments in it. Like for instance a certain one liner: &quot;Sh*t,
I Felt Safer Out side!&quot; coming from the comedian of the movie, it
raised a smile during the torture of viewing this.<br /><br />It is a bad movie, but not as bad as that piece of cr*p first entry to
the series. That was as lame as it comes that was, this is a little
better, but with a director who knows what he is doing it could have
been excellent.<br /><br />Script was a slight improvement to the dire first one, it does like i
said earlier have some flaws though. &quot;Jovobitch&quot;, &quot;not enough zombie
action&quot;, &quot;no horror at all&quot;, thrills yes but no horror i shall repeat
that again &quot;NO HORROR!&quot;.<br /><br />I noticed a few nods towards the games, Nicholai shouting &quot;No, don't
go!&quot; to the chopper, like in the films sequence of the original RE
game. I noticed a few other nods to the games in it as well, around 5
or 6 maybe more can't remember. Which i have to admit was quite good
and makes me wonder why in the hell didn't they do this with the first
pile of trash ?.<br /><br />Instead of them idiots in suits and script writer etc, fools thinking
they know better than those who play the games.<br /><br />They should be made to please fans more than non fans, as it will draw
non fans in as well if it is done the correct way. Not lame teen
marketed way that the first one was done and this one sits on the edge
of that line between fairly good movie and trash movie.<br /><br />Oh and as for the RE characters being in this one, THEY BETTER BE IN
THE NEXT ONE, AND BE IN IT MORE THAN BEING SIDEKICKS TO SOME &quot;THING&quot;
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SERIES.<br /><br />The next one had better be a hell of a lot better and have more RE
characters in it, it had better not be a one off in this movie for
them.<br /><br />Oh i almost forgot WHERE THE HELL IS WESKER!!!!!!!!!...the fools never
gave him a cameo at the end.<br /><br />&quot;Bruce Payne&quot; (Passenger 57, Full Eclipse, Highlander 4) he'd be ideal
as Wesker.<br /><br />Maybe &quot;Kevin Spirtas&quot; as Chris as well now that would be excellent
indeed if the two of them were chosen for those parts. I'd rate it
50/10 if they were in it, regardless of script writer or director.<br /><br />Rating for this movie 7/10. rating for Jill 9.5/10. rating for Carlos
and Nicholai 8/10. Rating for jovobitch 4/10. Rating for the action
8/10. Rating for the editing 1/10. Rating for the director 5/10 (would
have been higher if not for the p*ss poor editing he caused). Rating
for the soundtrack 0/10. Rating for the Score 9/10. Rating for the
plastic skinned Nemisis 8.5/10.
