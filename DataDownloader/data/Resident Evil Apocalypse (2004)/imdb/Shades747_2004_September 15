After rating the first RE movie as a &quot;10&quot;, I have to give this a &quot;6.5&quot;.
Not nearly as cool as the first, as unfortunately Paul Anderson let
someone else direct it. It has some MAJOR flaws (obviously the director
knows nothing about zombies), but those can be ignored if you love the
RE universe enough. The actress that played Jill was amazing - it
really did seem like it was Jill on the screen. A few other game
related goodness to be had, but I don't want to spoil it for any other
hard-core gamers.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the first movie, or a fan of the Resident Evil game
series, this is probably worth watching in the theater. Anyone else
should probably wait for a DVD rental.
