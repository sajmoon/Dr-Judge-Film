Despite having so many things wrong with this movie, I can't help but
love it. And there are a lot of things wrong. For the most part the
foreboding atmosphere of the games is just totally gone, there are some
characters who seem totally pointless (LJ anyone?), and the fight
scenes are quite possibly the worst I've ever seen put on film. Word of
advice, when filming a fight scene, make sure the audience can actually
see what's happening. The fight in the graveyard is the worst, other
than one kick (that's in slow mo) it's impossible to tell who is doing
what.<br /><br />However, I feel the film is saved simply by its inclusion of Jill
Valentine, who steals every scene she's in. Sienna's performance is
wonderful, and makes the film (or at least, her scenes) immensely
rewatchable. Her introduction is probably my favourite introduction of
any character to any film, ever.<br /><br />Overall, a hugely flawed movie, and other than a few nods here and
there not particularly faithful to its source material. But for some
reason I still love it, and it's worth seeing just for Jill Valentine
alone.
