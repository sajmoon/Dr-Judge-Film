This show was clever and funny -- and so the network really didn't get it.
Some of the satire of middle-class &quot;morality,&quot; school bureaucracy, and human
egotism was too sharp for the tastes of those folks who prefer every sitcom
to be a carbon copy of every other sitcom, all of which are Punch &amp; Judy
shows.<br /><br />Parker was a bright student with a couple of loyal buds who constantly
fought their way out of the snares created by the unimaginative world around
them. The show was creative, imaginative, funny, and touching. I'm glad to
see that it has a new life on cable reruns.<br /><br />Mental note: Watch the show!
