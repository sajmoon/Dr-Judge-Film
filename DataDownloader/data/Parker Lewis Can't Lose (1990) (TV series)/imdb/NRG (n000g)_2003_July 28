back in the early nineties, me and my best buddies back then loved this
show. parker, mikey and jerry where kinda role models to
us.<br /><br />the show's comic-like presentation is pretty cool, so are the gags. it
has
its own style. unique.<br /><br />nowadays, im watching it again. its even better now, because i get more
jokes than i did when i was 9 or 10. :)
sadly, i have to admit that season 2 isnt at the level of season 1, and
season 3 is almost a disaster. way too much love stories. in one episode
parker says &quot;i remember when this was my show&quot;, what made me think &quot;yeah,
me
too&quot;...<br /><br />however, its a must-see. at least season 1 and 2 are.
coolness.
