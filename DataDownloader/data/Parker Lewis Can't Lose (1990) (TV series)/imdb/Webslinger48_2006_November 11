Well, since you&#39;re reading this you probably are already quite familiar
with &quot;Parker Lewis Can&#39;t Lose,&quot; and like me, you&#39;re probably wondering
when the heck this show is coming out on DVD. Sony Pictures Home
Entertainment owns the rights to this show, and have shown how
completely out-of-touch they are but not releasing it.<br /><br />I have fond memories of watching this show with my family on Sunday
evenings on Fox. It first aired in September of 1990, and where I lived
in San Francisco it was on at 7:30 right before The Simpsons. Not only
was it one of the Fox Network&#39;s early hits, but even now it holds up as
a high-quality show of uncommon intelligence and humor. It also was a
trailblazer in a sense, being one of the few high school-based programs
airing during prime time in 1990 (pre-dating Beverly Hills 90210 by a
month). The story lines were inventive, the casting pitch-perfect, and
the editing and camera movements creative, enhancing the whimsical and
quirky nature of the show.<br /><br />It sure would be great to watch some of these episodes in pristine DVD
quality with commentary from the creators of the show. I&#39;d wager that
tens of thousands of fans that would gladly fork over $40+ for a season
one DVD set (the best season in my opinion). In the meantime, all we
can do is google &quot;parker lewis can&#39;t lose DVD for sale,&quot; to buy
poor-quality bootlegs to satisfy our joneses. It&#39;s a shame that in an
era when studios are constantly grousing about DVD piracy, they add to
it by not realizing the substantial markets that exist for programs
they own.
