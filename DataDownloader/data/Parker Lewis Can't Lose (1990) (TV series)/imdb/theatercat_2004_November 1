Best show ever<br /><br />At least the first 2 seasons... 3rd switched to character development
episodes, as most good shows sadly do. I am not exaggerating, although
one could make an argument that it takes 2nd place to the Simpsons. The
show was just as funny as the Simpsons, rewarding the viewer with both
silly gags and intelligent jokes that require a deeper knowledge of
their satire. It also requires suspension of reality. For example,
Jerry (the geek) has a trenchcoat that seems to be akin to Mary
Poppins's carpet bag... full of everything he needs for the situation.
It is definitely worth a look.
