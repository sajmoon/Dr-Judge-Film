This show illustrated early 1990s teen life with a new at the time method
of
cramming humor on many levels into a short thirty minute timeslot. Parker
became an icon for the changing sense of cool in the early 90s and saw
the
nation through a time of transition from 80s materialism and glam-rockers
into grunge and &quot;alternative&quot;ism. A rare ratings bringer for the at the
time
newly formed Fox Network, viewers welcomed change from the mentally
devoid
traditional family night viewing of the era. This show held its own and
managed to build up a decent if not cult following for the wisecracking
characters and sight gags/slapstick.  The first season was a comic
success
followed by 2 more seasons of half-hearted &quot;doogie howser&quot; type
plotlines,
however there were &quot;funny&quot; and &quot;cheezy&quot; shows in all three.
