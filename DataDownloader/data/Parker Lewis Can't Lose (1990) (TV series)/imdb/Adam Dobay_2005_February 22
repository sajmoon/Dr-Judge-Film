Although &quot;Parker Lewis&quot; was not a very long-running series, it shortly
became very popular in my home country Hungary when it was bought by
channel TV2. It took stock characters and stereotypes to the very limit
of reality, while the creators successfully avoided clich&eacute;s and kept
focusing on the consistent high quality of the jokes, whether textual
or visual. After multiple reruns, this show still leaves a nostalgic
feeling in just about everyone who had spent their tens and twenties in
the time the show was aired around Europe. The unique style and
exceptionally good sitcom humour of Parker Lewis makes it one of the
most outstanding comic series of the nineties. You can still hear
people quoting the series and synchronizing their watches every now and
then. Should it be released on DVD (as it is rumoured by an online
petition), the producing Columbia Tri-Star can make sure that there
will be many orders from Hungary and from Europe as a whole. Hope we
get a release soon.
