A few months ago when a friend of mine suggested that I watch
Schindler&#39;s List, and I wasn&#39;t too keen on the sound of it, but
eventually after repeated attempts for him to get me to watch it, I
gave in and I watched it. I was totally blown away, it&#39;s been made so
well, it&#39;s such an enjoyable film that has inspired me along with a
generation. I love watching the film, even though it is one of the
depressing and disturbing films that I have ever watched as the acting
was so believable and they were able to act together so well, that I
value this movie as one of the best of all time, and I&#39;m not the only
one if this film is currently sitting at the #6 spot on the IMDb top
250
