For a movie as monumental as Schindler&#x27;s List, I believe a review
should be conducted in a different style. Normally, my reviews consist
of multiple paragraphs, summarizing the plot and my thoughts on the
film. This time I want to give five reasons why Schindler&#x27;s List was
easily one of the most powerful and breathtaking motion pictures I&#x27;ve
ever seen. It goes above and beyond anyone&#x27;s expectation, and cements
itself on the list of greatest films of all time. Here&#x27;s why.<br /><br />1. Acting. No one could write about Schindler&#x27;s List and not talk about
Liam Neeson&#x27;s Oscar worthy performance as Oskar Schindler, the business
man from Czechoslovakia. He plays it with power and full force, grade A
acting. Still shocked his leading performance didn&#x27;t win him the Oscar
in 1994.<br /><br />2. Storyline. Instead of focusing on one of the survivors, or a
fictional story for that matter, Spielberg chooses to focus on Oskar
Schindler, a rather unsung chapter and character of The Holocaust.
Oskar Schindler worked for the Nazis, and is famous for using his great
wealth to buy hundreds of Jews to make them work in his factory. It
wasn&#x27;t much, but it prevented death, and they would make bowls for the
Nazis. Even though the film goes into a subject, some may not know, the
storyline is definitely one of the strongest points.<br /><br />3. The end sequence. I don&#x27;t want to ruin the final scenes in the film,
but let&#x27;s just say, it&#x27;s one of the most effective and well done scenes
in film history.<br /><br />4. The film&#x27;s desire to &#x22;show it all.&#x22; When Holocaust movies are made,
so try to water the film down by not showing the terrible treatment of
innocent Jews. This one doesn&#x27;t. Despite the event being gruesome,
tasteless, and ignorant, no movie should subject itself to water down
the scenes. Unless it&#x27;s PG-13, and I doubt many Holocaust movies are.
Schindler&#x27;s List isn&#x27;t all about the gas chambers and things most of us
already know. We witness two of the worst things possible; (1) innocent
people taken out to the yard and being shot in the head with absolutely
no feeling on the guard&#x27;s part and (2) we see the heart-wrenching
scenes of peoples belonging getting tossed off balconies like garbage.
That part I almost couldn&#x27;t bear to watch.<br /><br />5. The complete carelessness for human life. Face it, the Jews and many
other races were dehumanized come time of The Holocaust. Life didn&#x27;t
matter to anybody. You could tell a Nazi officer that you just killed
sixty thousand Jews in one day and they wouldn&#x27;t flinch, yell, smile,
or object. They would say &#x22;Good work.&#x22; They wouldn&#x27;t take into
consideration you just killed sixty thousand mothers, father, brothers,
sisters, grandparents, aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces, and worst of
all, children of both sexes. One scene in the film, right before a
woman is shot in the head, the camera zooms in on her to show her
frightened reactions, her pale face, and her clearly nervous behavior.
Spielberg most likely did that to remind viewers that the victims in
this movie were people and they were innocent people with their own
feelings in life. Dehumanization lived in The Holocaust.<br /><br />Schindler&#x27;s List currently ranks number nine on the American Film
Institute&#x27;s (AFI) list of one hundred greatest American films ever
made. I am a firm believer that if this wasn&#x27;t in Spielberg&#x27;s hands, it
wouldn&#x27;t touch that list. Thankfully, we get one down to Earth and very
vibrant Holocaust movies that manages to accomplish what it should.
Just an all around amazing film.<br /><br />Starring: Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes, Caroline Goodall,
Jonathan Sagall, and Embeth Davidtz. Directed by: Steven Spielberg.
