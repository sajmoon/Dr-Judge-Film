In the past couple years, I have been taught about the Holocaust and
the Rwanda genocide. And so out of curiosity, I have seen both movies
made about the tragedies. Schindler's List was and is given a lot of
praise, but I didn't find the movie as compelling as &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot; or
many other stories. This movie sorely lacks characterization. In order
for the audience to truly grasp the tragedy of genocide, we first need
to establish a connection with the characters that undergo such
torture. But the truth is, other than the main characters, those
surrounding Oskar Schindler, we mostly never get to see the other
characters through the methods of characterization. The almost never
talk, a background story is rarely given, we never get an idea of other
character's opinions about them and like I said they never talk. All we
know about them is what we see. About the only the writer's and
Spielberg lets us see the tragedy is watching total strangers go
through h***, but we get no idea of their personality, hopes and dreams
with the exception of some small addititions. This movie suffers the
same fate as &quot;The Passion of the Christ.&quot; It spends it's hours showing
us blood, gore and misfortune and expects us to feel sorry for the
characters. But without really understanding that the characters truly
don't deserve the torture they go through, we can never really
understand the tragedy. The film is good, but the lack of a rich cast
of characters, I really cannot give this film a 9 or a 10.
