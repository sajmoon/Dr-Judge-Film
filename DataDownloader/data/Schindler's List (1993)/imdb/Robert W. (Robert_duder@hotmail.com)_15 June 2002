I had no expectations going into this movie.  I had heard different opinions
about it and I was pleasantly blown away by it.  It left me in tears which
few movies ever truly do.  I honestly believe this to be one of the top ten
greatest films of all time...not necessarily because of it's watchability
but because of it's content and the way it is filmed. Liam Neeson (Who I
have never been fond of) plays Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi Party
who is a brilliant business man, con artist, and German personality.  He
loves his ladies and his booze but is also quite humane right from the very
beginning.  When the Germans invade Poland and begin to send Jews into
Ghetto's he opens a factory making cookware (pots and pans) using the jews
as labor.  However, it isn't cruel labor but rather he is giving them a
purpose and treats them as equal workers giving them benefits and good
working conditions...to him...he's just making his money.  He is very humble
about everything and does not see why the Jews are so happy with him.  As
the movie continues we see the honest progression of the war and the hatred
towards the Jews.  The rumours of the gas chamber begin to circulate, and we
watch as Almon Goeth played chillingly by Ralph Fiennes (another actor I
have never been overly fond of) murders Jews at will keeping the other Jews
in check by fear.  Goeth is a power hungry, Nazi who thrives on seeing
people suffer by his hand.  He's been given a high powered rank and milks it
for all it's worth and enjoys it.  He snipers Jews from his window...just
for sport.  He's empty and pure evil.  When Schindler happens to oversee a
Ghetto raid by the SS he is moved to tears as he watches his workers being
brutalized.  As he makes his millions he wields his own more subtle power
with bribes, women, food, wine, reputation in order to progress his business
and save his workers. He then takes a quite signifigant more direct role by
actually buying off top ranking Nazi officials in order to &quot;buy&quot; Jewish
workers...the workers and their families who worked for him in his cookware
plant.  He begins to make a list of 1100 Jewish people he wants bought and
brought by train to his new Munitions plant where they are to make shell
casings for bombs.  A very intense scene takes place when the Jewish women
he &quot;purchased&quot; are re-routed to the wrong place because of an error in paper
work.  They think that this is it for them and the gas chamber will be their
destination but the error is fixed and the women arrive unharmed to
Schindler's Plant.  In the most moving scene in movie history...Schindler
breaks down before escaping Allied forces at the end of the war and realizes
how many had died outside his factory and how many he wished he could have
saved.  Liam Neeson performance in this entire movie but especially in that
scene will haunt me forever.  This film is never to be tossed on a back
shelf...it is so much more than a classic...it's brilliance.  I don't,
however, necessarily take it as historical fact when it comes to Schindler. 
In reading on him I don't see him quite as the beloved character you feel in
the movie.  He seemed more selfish and perhaps less humble in real
life...but nonetheless the man saved 1100 and then some Jews and that to me
makes him a hero no matter what.  This movie though is one no one can ever
miss.  It's a triumph!!!
10/10
