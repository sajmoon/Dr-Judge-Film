This Movie was sensational. It was a piece of art along with being
informational. It told people about the holocaust, and it also told people
about the human spirit. It shows how people can just triumph over anything
with just some help from one person
The things that Spielberg did with the movie was incredible too. The black
and white was genius, and how he had the little girl in red and the fire
was
phenuminal. I have never seen anything like it, Schindler's List is beyond
all words.
