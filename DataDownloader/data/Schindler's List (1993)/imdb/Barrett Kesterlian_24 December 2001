Steven Spielburg finally proved to everybody that he is indeed a great
director.  We see here a movie that cannot be describes with simple words.
What, I believe, gave this movie its soul is that fact that the director
and
his crew truly dedicated this remarkable feat to the victims of the
darkest
pages of history.   Frightening as the scenes were,  so was its message of
final redemption.  Concentrating on the few who survived rather than the
millions who perished was indeed a dangerous step that could have offended
many.  And yet Steven pulled it off.  Through the survivors he honoured
the
dead.  Such complex feelings I had never felt at the movie theatres
before.
More words are useless.
