I have chosen this headline because it has a double meaning;
1.The person this is about is Mr.Oscar Schindler
2.This film was awarded with 7 Academy Awards (Oscar).<br /><br />Something is happening to you when you see this film. I can't think
of
any film before who has shown the Holocaust in the way this
film
does. Everything is so fantastic, John Williams' music, Janucz Kaminski's
filming and of course; Steven Spielberg's directing.
And the film gets even more realistic when it's filmed in
black/white.<br /><br />There's so many things to say about this film. I could have written
about it for several years. The locations they have used for the
shots
from the Jewish ghetto. The almost magical symbol with the
little
girl in red running around in the ghetto, the German maniacs
that
are burning all the dead people and the brilliant photograph
who
has filmed this,it makes you feel you're a part of the
story.
There is especially one shot I would like to say something
about.
When the steam-trains filled with the cold Jews are arriving
the
consentration camp in Auschwitz and the all the moments that
are
captured by Janucz Kaminski you really understand how these
people
must have been suffering.
Yes, it's a sad film. But it is fantastic!
