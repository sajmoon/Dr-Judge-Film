I Like this movie because it explains what a true man is like. A man
who will give up everything for others. At first I didn&#39;t know what the
Holocaust wast or what it was like. So my dad decide to show me. As
soon as I saw this film I cried so hard,I finally understood what it
was like.I may not be a Jewish man ,but I know what it feels like.
Hitler was a tyrant ,and thinking that it was there fault was wrong.
Steven Spielberg point of view of showing us what Oskar Schindler
really was the most brilliant idea.The cast he choose was brilliant.
Liam Nelson was perfect for the role of Oskar Schindler ,and he should
have won as Oscar for it.That is why I like the film. This is the best
movie ever made.
