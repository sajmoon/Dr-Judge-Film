Oskar Schindler is the central character in this film, but around him
Spielberg manages to wind a composite account of many of the worst aspects
of the Holocaust: from Krakow ghetto to Auschwitz. Perhaps this explains
the
success of the movie: at times Schindler seems only incidental to what's
going on around him, his best efforts to procure safety for 'his' Jews are
still but a drop of good in a torrent of despair. It's a movie about how
one
man made a small difference, but we never lose sight of exactly how small
it
actually was, when weighed against the magnitude of the genocide being
committed.<br /><br />The real Schindler was something of a flawed character: a big drinker, a
big
gambler, a constant womanizer, yet Spielberg's interpretation of Schindler
(or perhaps Neeson's) is a little more sanitized; his affairs are
mentioned
and indeed shown, but superficially, in a way that suggests they were
excusable, or the acceptable digressions of a man with a higher moral
purpose. Neeson portrays him well, nonetheless, although through reading I
tend to think of the real Oskar Schindler as being a little more
surreptitious, perhaps even weasel-like, rather than possessed of Neeson's
firm, assertive and upright demeanor. Like on other famous portraits of
heroes, perhaps some airbrushing of his less-attractive features has taken
place.<br /><br />What Spielberg has done well, however, is to capture the nature of Nazi
anti-Semitism: it's neither passionate nor uncontrolled, but is strong,
constant and deep. When Nazis kill or torment Jews in this movie, they
don't
show rage or hatred - they do it simply because it's expedient, because
Jews
irritate them, or they think of their victims as less-than-human and
therefore of limited worth. Two soldiers shoot a one-armed Jew shoveling
snow, laughing as they do it; another kills a wounded Jewish woman by
shooting her in the head; and, later, troops man and drive the 'production
lines' of Auschwitz, simply because it was serving an important purpose.
It
took a decade of dehumanizing rhetoric and propaganda for Germans to think
this way: that Jewish people are objects, and their arbitrary killing is
justifiable in many situations. Spielberg avoids the trap of turning the
Nazis into a breed of maniacal, irrational murderers with a constant
bloodlust, for this was not the case; the answer is far more
complex.<br /><br />The scope of Schindler's List is huge, but it spans it well, and I doubt
there's been a better Holocaust movie yet produced - it remains as a
cornerstone of epic cinema.
