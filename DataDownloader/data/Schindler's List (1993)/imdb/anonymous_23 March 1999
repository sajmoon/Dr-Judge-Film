When AFI declared this as one of the ten best films of all-time,
they
were right on the money. Certainly an all-time classic, the film conveys

emotions of the Holocaust Jews like never before. The Holocaust was one of
the darkest periods in the history of mankind and only a man like
Spielberg
could describe it exactly as it was. An absolutely perfect
film.<br /><br />10 points out of 10
