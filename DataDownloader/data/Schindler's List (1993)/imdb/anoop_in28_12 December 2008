It really had a very deep effect on me. The value of Life I understood.<br /><br />I had heard about this movie very long time and missed the opportunity
to watch it a couple of times. So, I bought this movie and gave it a
chance. As many have said in their comments, Schindler&#39;s List leaves
you speechless. The history of mankind can&#39;t be re-produced better than
this. Hats of to Spielberg. . . .<br /><br />I have not heard about Oskar Schindler before this movie. So, from the
beginning till the interval I was just thinking about a profit making
business during the World War II period, and I was wondering what is so
good about this movie to give it 7 Oscars. But, as usual I was totally
wrong in my judgement. The ending was really touching. Liam Neeson did
a wonderful job. &quot;I could have got more&quot; . . . scene, really brings the
movie to its best.<br /><br />The movie has become one of my favorite and very close to heart. This
comment I am writing after watching the movie for 15th time.<br /><br />I Thank Steven Spielberg for giving Hollywood such a wonderful cinema.<br /><br />And I wish people would change their perspective about the value of a
Human Life.
