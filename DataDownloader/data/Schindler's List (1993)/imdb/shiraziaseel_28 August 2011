I never understood (and will never understand) why this movie is so
applauded by such a large number of people! an average of 8.9 seems
just impossible to me! I will start from the dialogs. This movie had
long dialogs. I&#x27;ve seen movies with long dialogs which I&#x27;ve enjoyed
every sentence of it, but the dialogs of this film were just plain
boring! Even IF we accept that the dialogs were meaningful, this
doesn&#x27;t cover the serious lack of enthusiasm in the dialogs!!! no
excitement whatsoever in their speeches!!! This movie failed to make me
care what was gonna happen next. And finally, though it may be
appealing to some, I can&#x27;t come to finding any interest in the Idea of
making a black and white movie in the 90s!! I know many people may
disagree with what I said, but with the reasons I have given, I believe
it&#x27;s not unwise that I expect at least a fraction of the crowd to agree
with me; therefore it&#x27;s just unbelievable seeing an average of 8.9!!!
