There's the ancient story of Orpheus who's going into the underworld to free
his wife and who failed. Then there's another story of a man who's going
into the hell on earth called Auschwitz to free some hundred women and their
children and he succeeded. The difference between these two stories is that
the last one is true.
Now many people will ask why that man by the name of Oskar Schindler did
that. I think I know the answer. There's another scene in this great movie
in which you can see Schindler and one of his many lovers by his side riding
horses. They are witnessing the liquidation of the ghetto from the top of a
hill nearby and staring at the scenes in disbelief and horror. Many Jews are
killed in front of their eyes (of course the murderers are not aware of
them) but Schindler isn't looking away. He isn't turning his back to the
victims until the woman by his side is telling him to leave.
Sometimes the last century is called the century of genocide. These genocide
were possible because millions and millions of people were looking to the
other side, while their neighbors were carried away, beaten to death, shot.
I'm not sure if I would do the same but if you watch this film what you
really should do you will see that one man can truly make a difference if
he's not looking away.
