Adapted from the best-selling book by Thomas Keneally and based on a
true story, filmed in Poland with an emphasis on absolute authenticity,
Spielberg's masterpiece ranks among the greatest films ever made about
the Holocaust during World War II. It's a film about heroism with an
unlikely hero at its center--Catholic war profiteer Oskar Schindler
(Liam Neeson), who risked his life and went bankrupt to save more than
1,000 Jews from certain death in concentration camps.<br /><br />By employing Jews in his crockery factory manufacturing goods for the
German army, Schindler ensures their survival against terrifying odds.
At the same time, he must remain solvent with the help of a Jewish
accountant (Ben Kingsley) and negotiate business with a vicious,
obstinate Nazi commandant (Ralph Fiennes) who enjoys shooting Jews as
target practice from the balcony of his villa overlooking a prison
camp. Schindler's List gains much of its power not by trying to explain
Schindler's motivations, but by dramatizing the delicate diplomacy and
determination with which he carried out his generous deeds.<br /><br />As a drinker and womanizer who thought nothing of associating with
Nazis, Schindler was hardly a model of decency; the film is largely
about his transformation in response to the horror around him.
Spielberg doesn't flinch from that horror, and the result is a film
that combines remarkable humanity with abhorrent inhumanity--a film
that functions as a powerful history lesson and a testament to the
resilience of the human spirit in the context of a living nightmare.<br /><br />Schindler's List is filmed in black and white, with one notable
exception: a little blond girl running around in a red coat. This is
where Schindler's transformation begins, and when the true horror of
war, will sink deep and hit you hard as a moment you will never forget.
The whole film has stuck with me for about 6 years now, and that one
particualr scene(s) that involve the child, i'll never forget.
Schindler's List is to me, a life altering experience, and is much more
than a movie.<br /><br />****/****
