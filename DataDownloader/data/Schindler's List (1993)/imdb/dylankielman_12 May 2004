I cannot explain this film entirely. The only way to describe this film in
one paragraph is, this film WILL make you cry. This film shows truely what
the holocaust was hell, torment, and horror. This film does truely show
how
hellish this period of time was and after you see this materpiece you just
simply cannot go back and see it a second time it just stays scarred in
your
mind forever. This film cannot be described as a film but instead as an
art.
This art has probally some of the most gruesome scenes that I will not
talk
about because of the horrors. Finally this masterpiece I think will always
be remembered for years to come even if every copy of this film is, lost
everyone will remember this masterpiece.
If you have not seen this film then I say not suggest that you should seen
this art.<br /><br />10/10
