Cinematographically perfect, deeply moving, tragic, horrifying -- and yet I
give the movie an F.<br /><br />The movie depicts a German nazi who slowly becomes aware of the criminal
nature of national socialism and from that moment on tries to save the lives
of Jews by hiring them for his alleged mat&eacute;riel factory.<br /><br />Now, the point is, the film premiered at a time when the majority political
as well as public opinion in Germany agreed (it still does, and more than
ever!) that there should be a close to the debate about &quot;this darkest epoch
in German history&quot;. I have the disagreeable feeling that in Germany - maybe
elsewhere, too - the message of movie is: &quot;Yes, there *were* Germans
opposing nazism, but  now lets no longer talk about this topic. Period.&quot;<br /><br />However, as long as the causes for fascist thought persist, history has got
to be told!<br /><br />Spielberg does tell an impressing story, but unfortunately the wrong one;
which is not to say that Schindler didn't take the right decision, rather
that it would have been wiser to make a movie about a non-nazi antifascist.<br /><br />
