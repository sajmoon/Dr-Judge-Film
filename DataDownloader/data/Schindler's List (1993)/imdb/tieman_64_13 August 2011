&#x22;Schindler&#x27;s List is an exploitation film.&#x22; - David Mamet <br /><br />&#x22;Schindler&#x27;s List? Kitsch as fat as a dinosaur.&#x22; - Imre Kertesz<br /><br />Steven Spielberg directs &#x22;Schindler&#x27;s List&#x22;, a sentimental,
sensationalist film which has virtually nothing to do with the
Holocaust. But of course audiences never went to &#x22;List&#x22; to think or
learn. This is a black and white horror film, providing shocks and
jolts and artfully constructed little moments of &#x22;realistic&#x22; terror.
Audiences went for the same reason they went to see &#x22;Jaws&#x22;. They wanted
to be shocked. <br /><br />Spielberg takes the visual touchstones of the Holocaust,
(trains/showers/fences/chimneys etc) which audiences automatically
recognize, and then uses them to create little action set pieces. Will
the gas chambers work? Will the Nazi&#x27;s find the girl? Will the sniper
let the woman live? Will the train stop? Will the little boy find a
hiding spot? Will the gun misfire? Will the hose be long enough? It&#x27;s
like a silly game of pee-a-boo or whack-a-jew. The mindset also turns
up on a larger scale near the film&#x27;s end, in a tasteless suspense scene
that mines thrills over whether the list will arrive in time to save
the Jews from getting gassed. And so on and so on.<br /><br />People criticize the film for being morally black and white, for being
thoughtless, for its pantomime characters, for being Zionist propaganda
(the final scene is shocking in that it uses Nazism to suggest that
Israel is the only alternative to Jewish persecution), for presenting
&#x22;good&#x22; and &#x22;evil&#x22; as being inexplicable (none of the characters
thoughts or motivations are explored) and ignoring all nuance, history
and politics. These criticisms are valid, but really, these people are
criticizing a film that &#x22;List&#x22; never tried to be. It&#x27;s a thriller. An
exploitative horror film disguised as art. That is the real immorality
of &#x22;List&#x22;.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, Spielberg ignores all truths and instead opts to
propagate Western Holocaust myths. The fact that Goeth, who was
arrested by the SS Judiciary and imprisoned on charges of &#x22;brutality
and sadism&#x22;, was an anomaly and precisely the kind of figure of excess
that undermines and makes events like the Holocaust impracticable,
isn&#x27;t brought up. Instead, with the exception of Schindler, all Germans
are portrayed as brutes. Schindler (whom modern historians - Jitka
Gruntova, David Crowe - don&#x27;t regard as having altruistically saved
anyone) is himself Spielberg&#x27;s typical father figure who slowly learns
to love his flock of children. Meanwhile, the film&#x27;s Jews are reduced
to a slightly gentrified version of Der Sturmer caricatures: the
childish, initialized mass of holy innocents, the bespectacled
accountant, the dangerous Jewish seductress, the money men in the
church etc. Or, as Yosefa Loshitzky put it, they&#x27;re strikingly &#x22;similar
to their images in Nazi propaganda&#x22;.<br /><br />Gone are all messy complexities. &#x22;List&#x22; ignores the fact that the kapos
routinely conspired against fellow Jews, and that often only the
wealthiest could get on Schindler&#x27;s list in the first place.
Schindler&#x27;s history is wiped clean too (he used slave labor for most of
the war), as the fact that he worked for the Abwehr and procured the
Polish uniforms and information to be used in the Gleiwitz Incident,
the &#x22;false flag&#x22; operation which was used as a pretext to start the
invasion of Poland, and therefore World War 2, is far too traumatic for
audiences who want neat cartoon demarcations. Western Anti-Semitism is
likewise shunted aside, Hitler&#x27;s brand of Imperialism is never mirrored
to the equally insidious behavior of the other world Empires and the
fact that Hitler&#x27;s war was the &#x22;logical&#x22; outcome of early techno
capitalism and that all world powers were equally complicit in the
Holocuast, is ignored. Likewise, the way the West effectively
blackmailed (and abandoned) Poland and used them for a proxy war is
neglected as well as all manners of socio/political/historical
complexities. Schindler saved 1200 Jews you see. That&#x27;s all that
matters. Turn off your brain. Shed a tear. Remember. Everything is
okay.<br /><br />End result: WW2 and the Holocaust reduced to a kind of historical
brainwashing: &#x22;evil Nazis kill cute Jews, good Nazi save some Jews,
debt paid if Jews allowed to keep Israel&#x22;. The film turns the Holocaust
solely into a Jewish experience. No one else suffers, nothing else
matters. Like &#x22;Private Ryan&#x22;, the film exploits the context of war and
deliberately lies in order to tell a fantasy of
rescue/survival/redemption. The real narrative subtext here is the
restoration of family and the recuperation of a nation and its history.
The boosting of comfortable myths and the avoidance of truthful
confrontation in order to provide superficial closure. In ignoring all
issues, it bolsters that which allow these problems to continually
repeat themselves. <br /><br />Spielberg&#x27;s optimism is correct, but he is wrong in placing the blame
on a failure of individuals and individual ethics/responsibility,
rather than the system itself. At their core, these are systemic,
ideological problems which continue to this day, and yet the film
condescendingly lets its audience pat itself on the back for believing
that it, like Schindler, would give up its riches to save lives. The
double-binds and compartmentalization which made and continues to make
such &#x22;morality&#x22; impossible (as well as futile) are not shown. It&#x27;s only
easy to say &#x22;yes&#x22; to the film&#x27;s ethical dilemmas when you&#x27;re a wealthy
and powerful factory owning Nazi. <br /><br />Unsurprisingly, the film takes the shape of a &#x22;monster vs kids&#x22; ride,
the Nazi&#x27;s becoming a surrogate for Spielberg&#x27;s tripods/pirates/sharks/
dinosaurs/trucks. They zap Jews and you jump. Because &#x22;List&#x22; has a
higher cum-shot-jew-kill ratio, all other Holocaust movies are obsolete
to salacious, contemporary taste buds. Other movies don&#x27;t kill enough
people for them, don&#x27;t give them that Hitchcockian buzz. Notice no one
went to see &#x22;Amistad&#x22;. Spielberg didn&#x27;t kill enough slaves. He learnt
his lesson with &#x22;Ryan&#x22;, though, and dispatched a couple thousand Nazis
for your amusement. Self-congratulation sells best with blood.<br /><br />7/10 - http://www.imdb.com/user/ur4130201/comments
