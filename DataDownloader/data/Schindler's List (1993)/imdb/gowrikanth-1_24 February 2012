A close friend of mine had recommended this movie to me. For long I did
not watch it thinking it was just another movie with a &#x27;war&#x27; theme.
When I eventually watched it, I was kicking myself that a movie buff
like me took so long.<br /><br />Schindler&#x27;s list is based on the &#x27;Holocaust&#x27; era where Jews were hated
and brutally killed in Nazi regime. The movie begins with the
relocation of Jews from the neighboring areas to Ghettos just after
world war has commenced. In parallel, we see Oskar Schindler, a German
businessman (and a womanizer) trying to cash in on opportunity to make
profits. He hires an accountant Itzhak Stern and uses his skills to
expand. During the course he also befriends SS Lieutenant Amon Goeth
who is responsible for overseeing the Krakow Ghetto. During the course
of Amon&#x27;s governance we witness the brutal killings of Jews. Specially
we get to see how the Nazis selected their Jewish work force (retaining
skilled laborers and murdering old/unhealthy ones). This is the point
where Schindler decides to splurge his fortune to save the Jews. The
rest of the movie shows on how he goes about accomplishing this.<br /><br />Performances are top notch. Liam Neeson as Schindler is natural and
brilliant. The scene in the end where he makes a speech and eventually
breaks down is touching. Amon Goeth as the ruthless Lieutenant is
equally good. I was a little surprised that neither of them won an
Academy for the efforts. The supporting cost is headed by the ever
dependable Ben Kingsley.<br /><br />Technically the movie scores on several grounds. Shooting the movie in
B&#x26;W makes it chilling especially the scenes in Ghetto. Along with the
(haunting) background score, some of the scenes stay in your mind
forever.<br /><br />Above all, the real star is the genius Steven Spielberg.<br /><br />Towards the end of the movie, Ben Kingsley tells Schindler &#x27;the pages
with names is life&#x27;. That is what this movie is about. It is about
Humanity and it has no boundaries.<br /><br />***Whoever saves one life saves the world entire***
