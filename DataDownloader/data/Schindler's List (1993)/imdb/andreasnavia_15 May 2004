<br /><br />The first time I watched this film I was 13 years old. I saw it because my
History&acute;s teacher put it on class, as he explained us The Second World
War.
I watched it that day in class and 2 more times at home that afternoon. I
couldn&acute;t belive what I was seeing!! We all knew what had happened to the
Jewish but as a I saw the film time after time I couldn&acute;t understand how
people, how ourselves, could go too far.<br /><br />I agree with many people about this is a very hard film and about
sometimes
it is difficult to continue watching it, but I think it is the most
perfect
film I have ever seen because of its realism, because this film explains
us
what it really happened. It is disturbing, sad and horrible, but actually
for me it is the most beautiful film in the world because thanks to it I
can
see (not study, not read, I CAN SEE) what happened during one of the most
important moments of our History.
