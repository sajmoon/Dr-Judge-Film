First I have to say that being born in Poland, I knew about holocaust since
before I was 10. I guess only in Israel people are more aware of it. It is a
very sensitive topic, and making a movie about how millions of people were
exterminated in death camps seems like trivialising the topic. On the other
hand criticizing the movie for it's factual faults is even more slippery
nontheless. The movie itself is very good indeed, with great acting,
memorable scenes, and overall very impressive. I remember that when the end
credits started rolling people in the theater were very quiet, and didn't
move. Many were shocked by the realism of this movie. It surely is one of
the greatest movies ever, but Steven Spielberg intended it to be much more
than just a movie. This is where I stop admiring his work.<br /><br />Many will take this film's version of history as a fact. I'm talking about
the way Poles were shown in SL. Mr. Spielberg presents us as hateful
antisemitic creatures, and he does it so convincingly that if I didn't know
any better I would surely believe it. The second issue is the gas chamber
scene - in reality, none of the people who would enter the so called &quot;shower
room&quot; would survive. And as for Oskar Schindler - he didn't consider himself
as a man on the mission, not concerned about his profits at all. To sum it
off - If you didn't see this movie, go see it.<br /><br />But don't stop there, find some real live accounts of holocaust
survivors.<br /><br />
