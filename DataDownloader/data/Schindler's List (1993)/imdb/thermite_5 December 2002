Schindlers list has everything. It's boring, it's horrific, it's
pretentious
and it's bad. I think the worst thing about Schindler's list is that it
seems to be made for the director, not for the audience. It's Spielberg's
message to his critics that he can be serious, but honestly, three and a
half hours of black and white is trying just a bit hard, and the little
red
girl is just totally over the top. The worst part about it is the
manipulative subject matter, the Holy Cow of the holocaust. Spielberg
tries
to tie up the seriousness of the plight of the Jews in World War II with
the
seriousness of his film making, and it turns out totally faux-arte. Give
me
a break.
