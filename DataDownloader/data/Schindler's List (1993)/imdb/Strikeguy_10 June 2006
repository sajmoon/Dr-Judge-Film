For over (about)10 or 12 years of schooling before, during and after
junior and High School including now, I have had so much understanding
about of what happened in the 1930&#39;s and 1940&#39;s during the WW&#39;s, I came
about that this film told me more than anything EVEN the behinds the
Scenes. I do understood everything of what happened about Hitler&#39;s BS
reasons and of the sacrifices from the Jews in that era of all of the
killing for no reason for killing Jews. Nowadays we all know that Jews
and other religions, we are all equal from our rights. But of talking
about that movie, that gave away everything (because Spielberg was
living through those years as well). He was very smart and wise for
filming that movie.
