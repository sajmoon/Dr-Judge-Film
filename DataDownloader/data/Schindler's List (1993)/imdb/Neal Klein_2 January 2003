For anyone to adapt the novel as well as Spielberg has, that person would
have to be a genius. The story is long, involved, and makes no bones about
the ambivalence and inconsistence of Oskar Schindler. The tale is not nearly
as simple as that of rescue. The adaptation and direction are perfect ...
with one exception. The ending is rushed, the melodramatic speech by
Schindler is terribly out of tone with the movie, and the playing of
&quot;Jerusalem of Gold&quot; over the placing of stones on the Schindler grave is
ludicrous to anyone who is Jewish and over forty. The last ten minutes of
&quot;Schindler's List&quot; are pure and unfortunate Hollywood, plain and
simple.<br /><br />But the film has so much power and masterful storytelling in it that these
flaws are tiny by comparison. The performances are heartbreaking, the
tension tight and often less predictable than anyone could think, and the
touches of color in the black &amp; white film are symbolically exact. What
happens in this movie is such a powerful illustration of anti-Semitism and
the backdrop of Nazism that it is unquestionably required viewing for anyone
who needs to see how insidious and destructive prejudice is, and how the
Holocaust changed the world of the 20th Century.<br /><br />My father and I saw this in the theater. He survived Auschwitz-Bierkinau and
Matthausen. When he walked out of the movie, he clucked his tongue and
stated flatly, &quot;It was worse than that.&quot; I was in tears for hours. The
disparity in that moment said much more to me than the movie itself about
the story Spielberg had taken upon himself to tell. So be warned that this
film is not for the faint of heart. Oddly, the cynics will probably view
this movie with inexplicable dispassion. After all, how could anything this
horrible have ever taken place within our lifetime?
