Schindler's List, in my opinion, is the best American film ever made.  It
is
a nearly flawless motion picture with impact that lasts long after the
movie
ends.  Spielberg's storytelling techniques continue to amaze me and
Schindler's is the film that he will be most revered for in the centuries
to
come.
