Before I saw it, Schindler&#x27;s List seemed to me to be spinach cinema;
it&#x27;s good for you, but you don&#x27;t like it. I planned to watch it out of
a sense of moral obligation rather than keen expectation. I knew its
reputation and felt its importance bearing down on me heavily. I got
the DVD. I put it in the player. I settled down. Within a few minutes
something truly remarkable had happened: the movie had started working.
It drew me in and held me there. I was solemn, but not depressed. I was
absorbed, but not entertained. I was taught, but not preached to. This
is not a conventional movie in any way. It does nothing you expect and
many things you don&#x27;t, but in the end exceeds all expectations.
