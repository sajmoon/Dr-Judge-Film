Sometimes, when you've got a great story and a great storyteller, an
audience - not wanting to be exposed as the weak link in the Storytelling -
can become a detriment to the integrity of the Storyteller's work as it
scrambles to manufacture its appreciation.  I refer to an &quot;emperor's new
clothes&quot; dynamic.<br /><br />I want to appreciate this film like the pretentious kids down at the video
store do - and I can't seem to &quot;get it.&quot;<br /><br />I like &quot;Schindler's List,&quot; but what is all the fuss about?  Am I missing
something?  Am I desensitized to greatness?  Did I not get the memo?
Someone help me out (And while you're at it, I didn't like The English
Patient one bit).
