This is a film which challenges the human nature. How is the human race
capable of such babaricy? Such genocide and mindless, unnecessary slaughter,
just because of religion. It makes you sick. Schindler's List is a film
which tackles the issues of war, religion and the human spirit with
emotion.<br /><br />It revolves around Oskar Schindler, a factory kingpin who, amidst the
chaos and slaughter of the war, decides to help the defenceless, enslaved
Polish Jews. He makes a list, comprising of 1100 Jewish people, whom he
shall liberate and set free. Hence, Schinder's List.<br /><br />Spielberg's direction is first class, and he tells the story with emotion,
yet the film is totally in-your-face. One scene which captures the poignancy
is where the red dress of a little girl is shown in colour, even though the
film is shot in black and white. It sticks out and captures the essence of
innocence. A master stroke.<br /><br />I loved the movie because it was so heartfelt and so deliberately graphic,
it just stirs so many emotions and shakes the finger at ourselves. It is a
brilliant movie.<br /><br />Ten out of ten.
