Steven Spielberg has stated that it took him ten years to even become
comfortable with making 1993&#x27;s Academy Award-winning Schindler&#x27;s List,
and it was worth the wait. Well-crafted in almost every aspect, this
movie is a little over three hours long but is capable of holding the
viewer&#x27;s attention and teaches a lesson of tolerance that no movie has
ever done before. Featuring a professionally-written screenplay,
flawless acting, brilliant direction, a tearjerking storyline, and
unbeatable character development, Schindler&#x27;s List is essential for all
movie buffs!<br /><br />4/4 Stars
