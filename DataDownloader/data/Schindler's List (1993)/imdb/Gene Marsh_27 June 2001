No more analysis need be done on this movie.  My wife and I firmly believe
this should be required viewing in schools.  As much as there is literary
license taken within the movie, it yet illustrates, more than any other
movie in memory (with, perhaps, the exception of The Sorrow and the Pity)
the inhumanity and reality of life (and death) in Europe during WWII.  This
is a lesson that needs to be well understood and never
forgotten.
