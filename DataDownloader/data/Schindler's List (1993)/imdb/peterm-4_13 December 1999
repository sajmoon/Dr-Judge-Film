When I first saw Schindler's List, I could not say a word for a long time
afterwards, such was the effect of Spielberg's powerful film, which is, for
me one of the greatest of all time. I have watched it several times since
and, each time the same thing happens. Watching these unknown people suffer,
and seeing a corrupt businessman suddenly decide to help them never fails to
touch me. This film also has what is possible the most moving final scene in
cinema history.
