There are very few movies which excel in every category of good filmmaking.
Schindler's List is on the top of almost every category in my mind. But
what
stands out the most is the direction. Schindler's List has to be hands down
the best directed film I have ever seen. Saving Private Ryan is the only
movie which truly comes close. Spielberg is perhaps the greatest director
we
have ever seen in the film industry. This movie is perfect. I give it more
acclaim than any other film made within the last twenty-five
years.
