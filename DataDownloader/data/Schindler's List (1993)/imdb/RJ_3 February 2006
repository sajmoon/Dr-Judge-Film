Mr. Spielberg did a great movie about the holocaust and how a non-Jew
was in the forefront of saving Jews from certain death by the SS
squads. I hope that Mr. Spielberg will one day go full circle and
include all the pain, misery, and sufferings brought upon by the SS
during WWII upon the Gypsies, The Christians, The 20,000 Polish
officers killed by Stalin's men in Katyn, Poland in 1941, and tell the
tales of all God's Children of The Human Race, instead of just one. All
The Forgotten, All The Weak and Oppressed during the nightmares of The
Holocaust, mot only always about &quot;The Chosen&quot;. I think the movie was
very inspiring and spoke of the horrors that befall mankind when
mankind &quot;forgets&quot; the past. We need to look at this movie with not only
reverence but a deep seated understanding that it &quot;could&quot; happen again
if &quot;good people remain silent.&quot;
