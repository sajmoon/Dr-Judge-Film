This movie has left me wanting to cry and cheer at the same time. I did
actually cry; the first time I really cried when watching a film. I
usually can separate myself from the fictional events of a movie, but
not during the last ten minutes. I was appalled at the scenes included
in this movie, and they were both cold and moving at the same time.
This is the best movie I have ever seen. If I had been in a room with a
hundred of my peers, swearing to laugh and taunt me for life if I cried
I would have still wept. Two of the starring actors&#39; performances were
definitely grade &#39;A&#39;. Liam Neeson puts on a flawless performance in my
opinion, as does Ben Kingsley. However, the performance of Embeth
Davidtz (cast as the maid, Helen Hirsch) left me disappointed, as did
Raplh Fiennes&#39;. As far as story goes, this is a moving and powerful
one, that ought not to be forgotten. I wish I could touch on the
specific parts of the movie that moved me most without spoiling any of
the ending. I also wish I could personally invite the entire Nazi
regime over for &quot;special coffee&quot; laced with strychnine; especially
Goeth, if he was a real person, and definitely Hitler if he were alive.
