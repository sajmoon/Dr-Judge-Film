Beyond a doubt is this movie my favorite of all time! I hope everyone can
learn a lesson or two from this movie. Not only is its cinematization
beautiful, but it will bring you to tears. Tears of wonder and joy, even
though I just cry at about everything. Liam Neeson was cheated on Oscar
night that's for sure!
