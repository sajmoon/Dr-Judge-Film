Schindler's List is undeniably one of the most emotionally moving films
ever made, not only for the Jewish people, but for humanity. The
perfectly accurate depiction of the persecution and execution of Jews
is indeed heartbreaking and moving. The portrayal of Schindler, who
transforms from being a cold, egotistical, greedy bastard, who only
cared about making money, profit, into a selfless, giving person who
worked very hard, and gave everything to save as many people as he
possibly could. The film also perfectly and chillingly depicts how the
Nazi's threw the Jews around, shoving them around, shooting them if
they felt like it, for no reason. <br /><br />The film has a great cinematography, that really captures the intensity
of the situations and scenes. The plot is good, and moves along at a
good pace, though it will test your patience if you aren't interested
in the subject of the film (though I don't really see why anyone
wouldn't be, at the very least, interested). The acting is all great,
by every single actor, but the one I really noticed was Liam Neeson,
who portrays Oskar Schindler, a character who undergoes a major
development through the film. The script is good, as it allows the
audience to see an accurate depiction of just about every single
situation that Jews were in, during the war. It is a depressing film,
yes, and a sad one, since it tells a very disturbing story, but it
should be seen by just about anyone who can sit through it(it does have
some violent scenes, but nothing very graphic), as it is a very
important and beautiful movie. Any person who considers him or herself
to be literate and intelligent should see this movie at least once. You
don't get a more accurate portrayal of the horror of being a Jew during
that time than this. I recommend this movie to anyone who can sit
through it, both concerning the length and the violence in it. 10/10
