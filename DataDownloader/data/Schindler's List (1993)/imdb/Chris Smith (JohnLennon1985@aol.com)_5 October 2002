Since before I could remember, I have had an interest in World War II. When
we began to learn about it, I was even more interested. Then I heard about
Schindler's List. Sure, I've heard the title before. I just didn't know what
it was about until High School. Never bothered looking it up. Then I saw it.
Spielberg has never made a movie this good.<br /><br />Ever since Star Wars Episode I, I've always been a Liam Neeson fan... And I
feel this was his best performance ever. Ralph Fiennes was good at making me
hate him (hard to believe that's the same guy who I thought was cool from
the Avengers). <br /><br />This movie makes you wonder why. Why would the NAZI party go through such
great lengths just to make Jews suffer? The only difference is the
difference in beliefs. Was it that they needed someone to blame for the
depression? But why the whole religion? I've been asking these questions
before I saw this movie, and this movie doesn't answer them... perhaps we
never will know the answers.<br /><br />This movie is really good. I give it a 15/10.  <br /><br />
