This film is easily my favourite ever. It's unbelievably well acted, the
backdrops are flawless and I don't think that the cast could have been any
better. Also, I think that this film, though criticised for being seemingly
&quot;historically inaccurate&quot;, comes closest to depicting the Holocaust as it
most likely was. All the rushes of emotion that come to you are powerful
indeed. The fear, horror and anger leave you shocked at what that generation
had to go through, and happy and relieved that nothing of that caliber has
yet to befall our generation. I think even that it can affect the actors, as
well as the audience, not unlike &quot;Saving Private Ryan,&quot; a more recent film.
I have heard Ralph Fiennes say that Amon Goeth was and most likely will be
the most difficult role he's ever had to play, simply because of the
complexity of the character. Liam Neeson is also brilliant, and I think his
character best sums up the majority of Germans at the time: taking advantage
of the situation, because they don't know what's going on. Then they find
out, and views undergo complete modification. My overwhelming view is that
the movie is a wonderful commentary, full of sophisticated symbolism, yet
isn't over the head of an average viewer. A work of art.
