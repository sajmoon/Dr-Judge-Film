This was such a great movie. Stephen is such a great director and his hard
work paid off. He made a landmark movie which will be remembered in years to
come. The acting was perfect. The music was perfect. The directing was
perfect. I believe this is one of the best movies of all times. All I have
to say is that I recommend this movie to anyone who loves an excellent
movie.
