After seeing this movie I needed a few seconds to come back to the
present. It&#39;s by far one of the best movies i have seen if not the very
best! It illustrates very close to the truth everything that went on
during the second world war to the Jew community in Poland. I, being a
Jew my self, was deeply shaken by this movie. It&#39;s thanks to people
like Schindler that i even exist. Mr. Spielberg did a fabulous job
along with his crew. A great movie in the loving memory of the 6
million Jew lives taken during that horrible war... Although extremely
shocking probably for most people, it is a fact of history, a horrible
massacre, an awful regime and a sick mind behind it.
