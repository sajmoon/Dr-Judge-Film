Rarely ever does a film come out that is a classic. This film proves it in
every way. It is compassionate and proves the understated fact that one
person can make a difference. Has anyone noticed that Steven Speilberg is
the master of the masters. He can take a section of history and make it so
vivid a four-year old can spread a tear. This is an achievement and should
be appreciated even more.
