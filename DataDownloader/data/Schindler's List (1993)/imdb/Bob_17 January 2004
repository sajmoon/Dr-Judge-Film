I do not give away plot details (nor do I understand why Anyone does!), let
me say this: you will Not be disappointed. A truly great film, most will
agree. Much better than the Piano in my mind. I'm sure the B &amp; W hurt the
box office, but Spielberg isn't concerned with that, was he?! For me, the B
&amp; W made it less intense (I'm nearly sure, that wasn't the main M.O.;
probably done because Steven &quot;saw&quot; the past in B &amp; W) &amp; I was glad. I do
wish to single out Liam Neeson &amp; Ralph Fiennes for electrifying
performances. <br /><br />Can not be overly praised.
