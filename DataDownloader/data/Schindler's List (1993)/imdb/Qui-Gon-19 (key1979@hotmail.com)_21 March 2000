Without a doubt, this would be one of the best films ever made. Speilberg
proves that he's not only good at action/sci-fi, but also good at drama.<br /><br />The film is set in the early 40's where Jewish people is getting oppressed
by the Germans. It is so real. I couldn't believe how German's were such
racists. It was seeing like a documentary about Oskar Schindler saving the
Jewish people. The filming techniques are superb. Especially the part where
they show the colorized jacket and candle lights while it's B/W.<br /><br />Speilberg always gets criticzed when he always shows his good guys bad guys
concept and it's all in here. But it's different with the Nazi's from
Indiana Jones. It is realistic. What is the real power we have? Does it come
from one's mind control? Or does it come from one's reasonless
rage?<br /><br />Let us all stop racism
