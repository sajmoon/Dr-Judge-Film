Very little films can do it. That is to leave me in tears, sharing the
pain of the characters on screen. I&#x27;ve seen plenty of &#x27;sad movies&#x27; and
&#x27;tearjerkers&#x27; over the years that I have left me emotion hollow.
(Beaches and Terms of Endearment come to mind.) Schindler&#x27;s List is
different. It matters. The realism portrayed is frightening. You&#x27;re not
watching a film about the horrors of the Holocaust, you&#x27;re witnessing
the horrors of the Holocaust. Decent people, people just trying to make
a living like you and me, put into such a devastating position for no
fault of there own. And a man, a Nazi of all people, who has a virtue
his peers seem to be lacking: compassion. But, unlike many weaker
efforts to exploit human tragedy, the protagonist (Oskar Schindler)is
initially set on cashing in on the force labor by the Jews he brings to
his factory. Over the story, his character develops more and more
feelings for his Jewish subjects. He reaches the point where they
aren&#x27;t Jewish workers, but fellow human beings.<br /><br />In that, Schindler&#x27;s List is a very human story. A film that every
single human being on the face of the planet should sit through, not
for entertainment, but to get a first person perspective to the horrors
man is capable of committing on each other. Schindler&#x27;s List is a
beautiful film. A miracle film. A film so emotional, down to the very
last scene, no matter who you are, you will be pouring tears by the
buckets.
