When I was younger, I lived in Holland for a while, which is where I saw
this movie when it came out in the cinema.
Holland was very much in the thick of things during the war, so I had
learned all about the horrors that happened there during history
classes.
I would say I was awed by this movie, although that is perhaps not the
right
word. Shocked definitely, and saddened too.
I watched it again last year, and although the impact wasn't as strong, I
still thought it to be very powerful, and deserving of an
8/10
