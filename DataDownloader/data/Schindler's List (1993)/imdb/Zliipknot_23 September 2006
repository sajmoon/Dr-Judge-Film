This has got to be one of the best movies I&#39;ve ever seen. EVER. I
thought that it would be very boring, since it&#39;s so long - I was
Extremely wrong! The beginning is a bit slow, but you get a picture of
who Oskar Schindler is, a rich, charming man with great social skills.
I couldn&#39;t think of anyone better than than Liam Neeson to play this
role.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes.. wow. He FREAKED me out in this movie as a SS
officer/commander. He playes the part extremely well - I couldn&#39;t
recognize his voice here. He really captured the personality of his
role. Wow.<br /><br />.. I mean wow.<br /><br />I wasn&#39;t surprised when I saw that Steven Spielberg directed this. And
I&#39;m not surprised that Schindlers List won 7 Oscars (deserved more!) So
if you have a lot of spare time on your hands, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD -
SEE THIS MOVIE! <br /><br />My rating: a clear 10/10
