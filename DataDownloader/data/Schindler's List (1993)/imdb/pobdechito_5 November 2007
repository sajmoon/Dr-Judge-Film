Without a doubt, one of Spieldberg&#39;s greatest movies. Breath taking &amp;
Mesmerizing. A work of art. It shows the nobility of a human being. In
this film you will see compassion, mortality, discrimination etc... You
will also see the power of one person. You will see that when one
wishes to stop malevolence, that it is possible. You will leave with a
sense of what Jews had to go through. The suffrage that this race had
to encounter during this difficult times. What they (Jews) did in order
to survive the termination of their race. You will have a glimpse of
what Adolf Hitler tried to do the Jews. I sincerely recommend this
movie. It&#39;s terrific.
