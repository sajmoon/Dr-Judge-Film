I have already commented on this movie but in reading several other viewer
comments regarding the &quot;infamous&quot; Liam Neeson teary goodbye at the end, I
feel I must add one more.<br /><br />First of all, this scene is not in the book at all. According to the
author,
this type of regret filled angst about not doing more to save more Jews
was
non existent.  That is not to say that by the time the war ended, Oskar
Schindler did not have some regrets or that it wasn't in his character to
have done this sort of mea culpa.  I will agree that when I first saw this
scene I thought it a bit out of place, or as another viewer put it, &quot;over
the top&quot;.<br /><br />If you wish to get a first hand insight as to the character of Oskar
Schindler and what motivated him, you must read the book.
