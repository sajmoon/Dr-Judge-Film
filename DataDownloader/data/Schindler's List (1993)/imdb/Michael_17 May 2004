I saw this film for the first time last night, and was moved by the
entire production. Yes it is a film, and it is fact that certain
liberties would have been taken, it is Hollywood after all, but i have
yet to witness a piece of such magnitude and such endeavor to portray
the Hollocaust as it was. Spielberg could have ruined this and made the
event seem like such a trivia that Hollywood had to glorify it to make
it powerful, instead he stuck with the truth and what happened, he
produced a film that is a credit to all involved.<br /><br />ritualphilosophy needs to get his priorities sorted. the masses that
were massacred and in the fashion in which they were has been well
portrayed in this film, and shows one particular historic event that
effected millions. Maybe your just a fan of Arnold and Sly stalon
movies that bear no truth just big bulky men saving an entire nation
with a toothpick. open your eyes and realize a piece off film that is
powerful and inspiring about one particular historic event doesn't mean
others have been forgotten. why don't you go and sit with a hot drink
and cuddle up with a good Ben Aflec film such as hmmm, &quot;pearl Harbour&quot;
is thats your idea of a film depicting an event so accurately!!!
