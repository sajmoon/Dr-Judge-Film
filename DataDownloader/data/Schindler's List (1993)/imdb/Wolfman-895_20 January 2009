From the Musical Score to the direction to the acting, the movie is
flawless and should be recognized as the greatest Film of All Time. A
gem form Steven Spielberg, Schindler&#39;s List dives deep into the works
of humanity and what a person is worth.<br /><br />Watching the Jews just slaughtered in this movie is very difficult
however. It&#39;s not that this movie has a TON of blood, although there is
a decent amount, it&#39;s what the Germans do to the Jews, or what the Jews
are forced to do, and how cruel and unnecessary it is that is so deeply
unsettling.<br /><br />Liam Neeson gives one of the greatest acting performances ever. His one
scene with him talking about how he could do more reaches out and truly
touches people, more than just the Jews hugging him in the scene.<br /><br />Schindler&#39;s List is the idea of a perfect Film. Something with as
strong a message as it may speak out to us and truly touch us is
outstanding. The acting is flawless, and the direction is breathtaking.
The one film everyone needs to see before they die.
