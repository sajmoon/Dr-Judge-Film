When I first saw that Spielberg was behind the movie, I had my doubts
since his earlier work doesn&#39;t really fall into this category, but I
held faith and I have not been disappointed! From the beginning it is
such a powerful and moving film and it brought tears to my eyes more
then once. It is completely set in Black &amp; White, except for the Red
Coat Girl which is pure genius, since it really helps develop the time
period it was portrayed in.<br /><br />The Actors too were completely fantastic! Every single actor and extra
seemed to be doing their very best and really lived their roles,
especially Ralph Fiennes, who was brilliant as the twisted Nazi Amon
Goeth. Not just anyone could make that character real and get away with
it. All of the characters in the film have depth and substance and the
best thing was that you actually see a few of the Jewish people
throughout the entire film so we can sympathize with their tale more.<br /><br />It&#39;s a film to watch if you enjoy depth and meaning. 9 Stars, Excellent
Film!
