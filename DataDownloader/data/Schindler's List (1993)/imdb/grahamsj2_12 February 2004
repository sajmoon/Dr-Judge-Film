This is a superb true story starring a superb actor in a wonderful
production. This film certainly deserves all the accolades it's received and
probably then some. Liam Neeson is perfectly cast in this story of a German
industrialist who risked everything to save at least a few Jews from the
death camps. Outstanding in every way! This is a future classic film and one
to buy and keep!
