Steven Spielberg used to entertain us;  now he educates us as if he were
entertaining, and his films are leaden with their messages:  slavery is
bad,
the Holocaust was bad, D-day was bloody.  He keeps taking the path of
least
resistance.  He used to charm us with his imagination;  in &quot;Schindler's
List&quot; he abandons imagination for the sake of repellent explicitness.  It
left me longing for the days of &quot;Forbidden Games.&quot;  Meanwhile, having
succeeded in dumbing down American moviemaking-as-entertainment in the 80s
to the level of &quot;The Goonies&quot; and &quot;Batteries Not Included,&quot; he proceeds to
dumb down the Holocaust with the introduction of fake art-house effects
and
fairy tale symbolism.  In interviews following the film's release he said
that the making of the film had so opened his eyes to the horrors of the
Holocaust that he regretted having used the Nazis as villains in &quot;Raiders
of
the Lost Ark&quot;;  apparently he literally needs a picture drawn for him -- a
moving one -- and assumes that we do, too.  It made me wonder if he would
go
back to &quot;Raiders&quot; if he could and digitize all the fun
away.
