I first saw this movie in the theater. After it was over, not a sound
could
be heard. It took a long time before the people even moved from their
seats.
Personally, I decided that some of the people that I knew, who did not
show
an interest in the movie, much less the holocaust, were going to see this
movie. I am happy to say that everyone who I showed this movie to was
moved
and learned a lot. I know that some of the facts in the movie were not
100%
accurate. Never the less, my friends and family grew, as compassionate
human
beings, after watching this film.
