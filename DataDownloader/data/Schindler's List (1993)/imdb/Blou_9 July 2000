I remember watching this film first in Year 9 History class whilst studying
Nazism. We didn't get to finish it, and I had never been bothered to get it
from the video store. Now, I'm glad I did.<br /><br />At 3 hours long, Schindlers List is a forceful look at the true story of
Oskar Schindler (brilliantly portrayed by Liam Neeson [Rob Roy, The Phantom
Menace]) who saves Jews from extermination in concentration and death camps
by way of putting them to work in his enamel ware factory. Although, it is
confusing about whether he really wanted to save Jews or whether is was all
about the money and the lifestyle: mistresses, drinking. This he shares
with
Commandent Amon Goeth (chillingly evil portrayal by Ralph Fiennes [ The
English Patient, Quiz Show]). Amon is an exceedingly evil character,
exampled by him standing on the balcony of his villa over looking Plazow
forced labor camp and randomly shooting people with his sniper
rifle.
Ben Kingsly, well known for his role in 'Ghandi' gives an excellent
performance of Itzhak Stern, a smart Jewish businessman, hired by Schindler
to keep his factory in order.<br /><br />This Oscar winning film is definately worth a look. Steven Spielberg
outdoes
himself and so does the cast *****/*****
