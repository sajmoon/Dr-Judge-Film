There were a lot of war films made that were focused on the holocaust or
shoah, but there are probably none that iv seen or heard that come with in
reach of the effectiveness, power and shear touching emotion of schindlers
list. I'm not one to cry over a film, (in fact i don't think i ever have)
but on more than one occasion during this film, tears came to my
eyes.<br /><br />I think the reason that schindlers list is so effective, is that it feels so
real, instead of simply showing you the holocaust, it puts you right into
it. You feel the pain and suffering felt by those in the film. You feel
guilty about sitting on your comfortable sofa munching on your big tub of
popcorn, watching so many people suffer.<br /><br />The effect of the black and white picture is that it makes it even more real
as most of the footage from the holocaust is in black and white, it also
allows you to pick up a few small but vital details.<br /><br />It the soundtrack is moving and deserves all the praise and awards it
got.<br /><br />Recommended; to people who take an interest in the holocaust or spielberg
films in general<br /><br />Not recommended; to people who don't like films that are sad or make you
cry, this is definitely not going to be your scene.<br /><br />Watch this if you liked; the diary of anne frank
