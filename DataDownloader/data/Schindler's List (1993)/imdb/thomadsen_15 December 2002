As a (Jewish) professor of mine once said, &quot;Spielberg doesn't have a
glimmer
of what it would take to do this material right.&quot; Don't be suckered by the
subject matter--it's still schlockified for mass consumption. And worse
still, it's likely the reason why every year since then we have to put up
with some sappy Spielberg backed Holocaust movie or documentary winning
another Oscar. Is this really how we want to respond emotionally,
intellectually and otherwise?
