This is just another film like Amistad that Steven Spielberg thought
might be important to put to film. But, after seeing a film like United
93, I feel that, going back to this film, I see it as exploitation.
That it is exploiting the pain of the entire holocaust and the tragedy
that it really was, and exploiting that for emotional reasons but
worse, to give Oskar Shindler an opposite, and something to purify him
from a narrative character perspective. It&#39;s not that I hate the film,
it&#39;s well made in every aspect, but it is basically a Frank Capra
picture set within a really huge tragedy. One character is not the hero
or villain here, there is no black and white. Since it chooses to
display the Holocaust so graphically, do it in a better way. But
watching the film and contrasting it to what actually did happen, I
have to wonder, is there a really truthful way of representing the
Holocaust? It&#39;s such a monstrous tragedy, the big abomination of the
20th century, should it really be put onto film, and are the words now
used to describe it, &quot;Never Again&quot;, really a truthful representation?
Is this how we want people to remember the Holocaust? Through a film
that presents a hero struggling to be a capitalist and struggling to be
a good man by Western standards by saving as many people as possible.
If he had saved &quot;one more&quot; person, it wouldn&#39;t have mattered. The film
is permanent, and the Holocaust itself is as well. I firmly believe
this is not the appropriate way to depict something that actually
happened and was so important. It&#39;s the singular voice of the director
here, this film might as well by &quot;It&#39;s A Wonderful Life&quot;, because that
is essentially what it is. The same story, the same character arc for
Shindler. It&#39;s just not appropriate and I think that the time has not
come yet for us to truly be able to grasp the atrocity of the
Holocaust. I believe the means of representation are not available for
us or at our disposal.
