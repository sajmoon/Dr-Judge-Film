Its time to comment on one of the BEST films I&#39;ve ever seen. The movie
based on the real life&#39;s story about a Nasi guy, Mr. Oscar Schindler
(Leam Nesson), who start to make money with the Jews in the infamous II
War. With a &uml;little&uml; help of his finance man, Itzhak Stern (Ben
Kingsley), not very happy with the idea, use the luck of the world and
the situation of the German army to open a factory that pay almost
nothing and get many money.<br /><br />As the time passing by the situation of the workers in factory get
worst and worst, the Nasi army turn more violent and careless about the
Jews, but Oscar Schindler keep watching them like people and feel the
weight of the slaughter, specially by Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) who
treat the Jews like something less than animals.<br /><br />The deal is that the Schindler&#39;s factory, inadvertently, becomes a
refuge and the mean of salvation for an entire community, and he tries,
despairly, to get them out of the fire line.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg&#39;s masterpiece and a jewel in the films history.
Spelberg brings the Schindler&#39;s List to life, the story of a man who
got nothing and leave with everything.<br /><br />This is maybe the 5th Nasi story I&#39;ve heard about, cause am not very
interested in the whole Hitler&#39;s madness, who should have said it??? Up
on the violence and the blood, there&#39;s a beautiful story of true power
drived by compassion and humility. An action like this, weirdly, is
inspired by suffering and the pain of a community, can not be seeing
every day, but Schindler did it, and its showed like a daily act. Not
like a saint but a defective and womanizer Nasi, and that&#39;s why its so
charming and inspiriting.<br /><br />Leam Nesson is the chosed one to take you trough the Schindler&#39;s
feelings in one of the most notables performances I&#39;ve ever watch and
so damn heartbreaking that made it so hard not to cry, serious.<br /><br />I&#39;m pretty sure that if there wasn&#39;t Forrest Gump this would be the
1st, and it is, but I can&#39;t chose which one is best, thought.
Otherwise, beside of being a Nasi movie, is the most beautiful movie
I&#39;ve ever watched, and a lesson to many people.
