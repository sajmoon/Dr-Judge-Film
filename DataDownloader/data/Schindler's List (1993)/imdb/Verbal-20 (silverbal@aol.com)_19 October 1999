One of the best and most powerful of all films, SCHINDLER'S LIST proves
that
movies don't have to be fun to be good. Brilliantly acted, masterfully
directed, subtly-yet-beautifully written, and horrifically realistic, this
excellent drama is one of my all-time favorite movies. Truly a showcase for
the talent of all the people who worked on it, this is definitely cinematic
art. A very important movie to see, and I do not use the word
frivolously.
