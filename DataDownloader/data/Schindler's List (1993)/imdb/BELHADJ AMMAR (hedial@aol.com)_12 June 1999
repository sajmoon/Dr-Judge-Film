Steven Spielberg's movie is undoubtedly a chef d'oeuvre.
First,Schindler's list is a superb plea for Tolerance,Humankind
and memory,and so on...
But it isn't enough to make a cinema masterpiece.
Schindler's list gives to the public all what he may expect
from a movie.(drama, great feelings and emotion)
Spielberg has reinvented the Greek epoch Tragedy.<br /><br />I've never been so moved by a movie.Moreover,Spielberg
takes the public into a deep introspection about Humankind...
Just go and see it! (It's an obligation).
