Right after &quot;The fellowship of the ring&quot;. I liked the second one more
because of its story, effects, sound, acting and its a really magnificent
movie. But on the other hand we have a moving, perfect movie. It presents a
so important part of history, reminds us of what happened in a very
emotional way, but never gets boring (sorry, but many other great movies
have this HUGE &quot;error&quot;). With Liam Neesons (Oscar Schindler) and  Ralph
Fiennes (Amon G&ouml;th) we see two of the best performances ever (together with
Marlon Brandos and Robert de Niros Godfather).<br /><br />It has also some moments which stand out from the whole movie and will stay
with me for all time (what is a proof for really good movies).
Here are 2:<br /><br />-When the first train wrongfully brings the Jews to Auschwitz and we see a
colon of people walking into a building. Then the camera moves slowly to the
top where we see a huge chimney, out of it coming black dust and we hear
only the sound of the fire...<br /><br />-When Schindler is &quot;recrouting&quot; people for his factory he also employs a
teacher. When the teacher is sad by the Nazis he isnt &quot;important&quot; he cant
understand it. He says: Since when arent literature and history important? I
love this sceen and its in my opinion the best of the movie. History-we must
know the history so we dont make the same mistakes as people already made
(racism...). and literature- literature represents of what are humans
possible. Creating something beautiful, that has not really a practical use
(dont misunderstand this!) but its made for higher reasons. The Nazis dont
understand higher reasons, they just want them to work, so they can win the
war. There is no space for something beautiful.<br /><br />-Finaly one of the last scenes: When Schindler is driving away at the end.
He starts to compare things to human lives...: This symbol, its made of
gold. For it i could save two lives!...<br /><br />And there are much more! One of the best movies of all time and for all
time!
