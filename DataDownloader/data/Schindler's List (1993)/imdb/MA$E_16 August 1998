Some people consider this a war film. I consider it a classic. When I saw
 this film for the first time I really felt bad about what happened to
 people during the war. I was happy that this film was shot in black and
 white because some of the gore I probably couldn't stand in color. Spielberg
 has definitely surpassed his Jurassic Park stage and moved on to better work
 like this or Amistad. I cant wait to see his new movie Saving Pvt. Ryan
 because it is also about WWII. If you watch this whatever your age it will
 effect like no other film can.
