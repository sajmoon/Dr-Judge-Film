The fact that this is based on a true story makes one pause, look into the
mirror and ask yourself if you would have had the courage and resolve to
do
what Schindler did.<br /><br />Most of us would probably verbalize that we would have. Many of us have
probably even convinced ourselves that we would have tried to do the right
thing. Maybe its just the skeptic in me, but I'll bet that, given those
circumstances, over 99% of us would have taken the easy way out which
would
have been to do nothing.
