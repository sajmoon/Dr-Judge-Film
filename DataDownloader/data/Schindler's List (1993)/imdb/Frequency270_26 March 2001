After seeing this movie, I regret not seeing it on the silver screen,
as this would have done this terrifying, magnificent, powerful film
even more justice. As it is, on the TV it is a mesmerizing and gripping
story. <br /><br />I have long ago decided not to have a favorite movie. Too many films
offer their own unique pleasures, and singling one out as a favorite is
simply to difficult a task.<br /><br />That being said, 'Schindler's List' is definitely one of my favorites.
I am surprised at the criticism I read, but I guess that is what makes
us the human race.<br /><br />The only real flaw in the movie that I saw was near the end, where
Schindler is berating himself for not saving more lives. I hope the
scene occurred in real life, otherwise it just seems contrived and
unnecessary. If it really happened, then the worst you can say is the
Neeson simply could not convey the impact of the scene. Or perhaps
Schildler really sounded like that at the time. Either way, it was a
minor scratch on an other-wise magnificent film. <br /><br />I won't comment on the films realism because my knowledge of history is
weak and I expect Hollywood to take liberties. As long as they kept the
spirit of the story alive, that is all that matters to me. <br /><br />To any one who hasn't seen this movie, I definitely say: see it! It is
not light viewing and parents taking their younger children--even their
older children, really--should be in attendance, and remember not to
dismiss this movie and the scenes therein as mere Hollywood magic. <br /><br />While I don't pick favorites, I do believe this movie will rate higher
than any other movie I have ever rated, with a 9.8 out of 10. If given
a choice between a 9 or a 10, I will give it a flat 10. <br /><br />Thank you.
