Firstly, it must be said that Ralph Fiennes is absolutely stunning as
the ruthless and cruel Goeth; it is without doubt the finest
performance by an actor that I have ever seen. How he did not win an
Oscar for this film is beyond me and probably beyond others. <br /><br />Liam Neeson also delivers a great performance as a man who lives only
for wealth and money but then changes slowly into a man of principle
who begins to feel empathy and sadness towards the Jews after
witnessing their persecution.<br /><br />This film depicts the atrocities of man and how it considers power to
outweigh the sanctity of life. Only after watching this film will one
realise that suffering and destruction are a reflection of reality; how
men committed unspeakable acts on behalf of their superiors and how
those same men were then led to fight for a purpose which was non-
existent. It must be emphasised that this will never change.
