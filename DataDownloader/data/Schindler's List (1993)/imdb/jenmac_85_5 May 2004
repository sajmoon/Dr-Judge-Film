This is a horror film.  Not a visual horror film but a mental and
spiritual
horror film. It drags out every kind of fear that can be expressed. It
shows
how not just one but two men can have an effect on a vast number of
people.
Hitler murdered 6 million Jews.  Schindler saved 1,100 in the most trying
of
circumstances.
As mentioned in one of the previous comments, it will not be long before
the
survivors of the holocaust will be gone and there will only be the
memorials
and films to remind us of the sickening atrocities that were carried
out.
This film serves as a learning guide to what can happen and an emotional
journey beyond what most films can take you on.  It should be shown to
every
child to let them know that the holocaust did happen.  This is not a
figment
of someones imagination that was written and published.  Within 6 years, 6
million were dead in those camps.
What is more concerning is that there are countries still at war with
families being torn apart.  Have we learned nothing!
I would tell anyone to watch this film.  All the actors deserve
recognition
for the thoughtful but brutal approach they took towards this
film.
Another from Steven Spielberg that will not be forgotten
