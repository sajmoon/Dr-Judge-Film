I waited six years before seeing this film for personal reasons. I finally
watched it today, and I can only hope that no one else ever waits to see
this.<br /><br />'Schindler's List' is film-making at it's finest. Take a story like this,
and a director like Spielberg, throw in incredible performances by Neeson,
Kingsley, and especially Fiennes, and you have one to the best motion
pictures ever made.<br /><br />It is phenomenal. Thank you Spielberg.
