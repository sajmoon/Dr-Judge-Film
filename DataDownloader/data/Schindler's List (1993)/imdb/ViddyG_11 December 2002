After many a year producing films of high entertainment, but lesser
intellectual class, Steven Spielberg finally created a true masterpiece of
our time. Consistently overlooked for Oscars for his previous films, the
Academy had no choice but to pour glittering praise over this cinematic
adaptation of Thomas Keneally's best-selling book.<br /><br /> I will not go into the details of the story as this should be imprinted
into the mind by the images of the film itself. Rather, I would like to make
special commentary on the direction of Spielberg, the screenplay of Steven
Zaillian and the excellent cinematography by Janusz Kaminski. The
controversial decision to film in black and white must also be specially
commended, as it adds to the atmosphere of the film greatly.<br /><br /> The thing which sets the film apart from any I have seen before or since,
however, is in the quality of acting. In parts, you lose the fact that it is
ONLY a film, and not a live-action documentary. Of particular note is the
exceptional British acting trio of Liam Neeson (Oskar Schindler), Ben
Kingsley (Itzakh Stern) and Ralph Fiennes (Untersturmfuhrer Amon Goeth).
Although the performances by the first two were magnificent, I do not
believe I have ever seen an acting performance to rival that of Fiennes in
his role as the Komandant.<br /><br />It is all the more remarkable considering that this was his first role in a
major film, having being plucked out of relative obscurity by Spielberg
having seen his performance in the television movie &quot;A Dangerous Man:
Lawrence After Arabia&quot; the previous year. It was an absolute travesty that
none of these acting performances were rewarded with an Academy Award,
showing the Oscars for the shambles that they really are.<br /><br /> I would like to end by making the point that I have never been left so
astounded by any film as Schindler's List. Some may say that it is part of
the propaganda machine that Spielberg has also used in other films, such as
Saving Private Ryan, and there may be some truth to this. However the simple
truth is that this film depicts life during the holocaust as closely as we
could imagine it sixty years on. Humanity would learn a great deal if our
young were taught about the mistakes of the past, and films such as this
should be a part of the educational curriculum in every country in the world
(as is the case in countries such as Great Britain and New Zealand, where
Schindler's List is a mandatory part of every 15 year old's history
lessons).<br /><br /> Finally, if I were to find one fault with the film, it would be the final
credit of the film - &quot;Dedicated to the six million Jews who died in the
holocaust&quot;. Spielberg seems to have conveniently forgotten the five million
gypsies, physically handicapped, mentally handicapped etc. who were also
murdered by Hitler's death squads. I believe the film should be dedicated to
these people also, truly reflecting the thankfulness we should all have for
a world in which Nazism did not prevail.
