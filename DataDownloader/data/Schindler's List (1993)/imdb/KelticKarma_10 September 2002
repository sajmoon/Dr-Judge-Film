Is it possible for Spielberg to make a film that isn't horrendously mawkish
? Can someone please turn off his sentimentality button
?<br /><br />Viewed nearly ten years after its making, this film's sole purpose of
letting the world know how guilty we all should feel about the holocaust
only serves to point up the horrors of the ongoing Israeli occupations in
Palestine. <br /><br />I really don't feel that this is a particularly good film besides
that.<br /><br />Ben Kingsley is insufferable, Ralph Fiennes hams it up, Liam Neeson sounds
like The Count from Sesame Street. <br /><br />Spielberg has stated that he set out to make a memorial to the suffering of
his people, and he has done a pretty good job of that. Unfortunately, his
undoubted talents lie in the field of fantasy, not reality, and this
self-indulgent polemic will not earn him his place in history.
