Schindler&#39;s List <br /><br />Countless films have been made about the Holocaust; dozens from novels.
None however, contain the power of Steven Spielberg&#39;s terrifying and
entrancing masterwork: Schindler&#39;s List. Not one can match his ability
to horrify us even as he manages to grip our attention and not let go
(three hours and fifteen minutes fly by). Unlike any other film that
attempts to teach about the terrors of the Holocaust, Schindler&#39;s list
holds back nothing. Its vision is violent, vibrant, and visually
intense&#133;unbearable to witness at points. But at the same time audiences
are drawn to watch violence; why is watching Schindler&#39;s List no
different then watching the victims of films like Saw get massacred?
One should not be afraid of the film; one should be drawn to learn from
it.<br /><br />When not being full blown violent, Schindler&#39;s List is a visually
enriched film. Gorgeous black and white cinematography help create the
feel of the era. Well re-created sets (most notably the German camps
for Jewish prisoners) look authentic; mixed with the thousands of
extras, Schindler is like some mortifying epic. The costumes as well
match the period of WWII; each looks spectacular in the crisp black and
white photography (though in real life they all looked mismatched). The
film is enhanced even further by the pulse-pounding notes of John
Williams&#39; score; at once entrancing, at other times haunting
(especially with children singing), making especially good use of the
violin (the sounds of the instrument ring in ones&#39; ear as well as the
images stay in the mind).<br /><br />In the lead role, Liam Neeson plays Oscar Schindler; a man of powerful
charm (noticeable from scene 1) portrayed beautifully by Neeson; his
lordly voice only adding to the character. At first Schindler is a
rotten member of the Nazi party; he is a womanizer (though he is
married), and his sole concern of the war is to make a profit with it.
He opens a factory and uses captive Jews as his work force; at first
only caring for profit (he cares not for the one-armed man who is later
shot). With the help of his assistant Ishtak Stern (Ben Kingsley, in a
constant state of fear it would seem; his subtle expressions and
actions suiting the character perfectly, and balancing well with the
high-voltage power Neeson and Fiennes reign with), an accountant, the
factory turns into an instant success. But when Schindler begins to
witness the horrors of what is really happening to the Jews (Neeson&#39;s
face unforgettably haunting as he first lays eyes on the massacres) he
starts to change. His first act of change is his conversation on power
with a German captain (he says the merciful are more powerful then
those who would kill mercilessly). His second is the simple offering of
water to prisoners on trains. His final, most important and dramatic
(essential to the story) is when he begins using his factory as a
refuge for the Jewish people.<br /><br />And as the story of Schindler goes on, Spielberg painting a portrait of
infinite Nazi high-life, using steady camera, it is inter-weaved with
the troubles of the Jewish people; Spielberg&#39;s camera now using a
shaky, documentary-style to follow the action. Without apology
Spielberg has kids blasted, countless innocents murdered on the spot,
and he shows how the Jewish people were made to strip to nothing for
medical checks. As blood runs across snow there is a Hitchcockian-like
terror to it. The intense images Spielberg illustrates become engraved
in the mind (like the children being carted away on trucks to their
death; their mothers chasing after crying).<br /><br />Most horrific though is the prison camp; where German Captain Amon
Goeth (Ralph Fiennes; unstably violent and perfect down to his very
sneer) shoots Jews from atop his household just because he can. He
likes to kill. Spielberg creates an atmosphere of pure terror here;
this unstable community could be disrupted at any moment by gunfire and
killing.<br /><br />Flashlights leer, ashes fall like snowflakes, people line up to be
incinerated&#133;the visual perfection of Schindler is mesmerizing.
Combining narrative with horror, Steven Spielberg majestically tells a
beautiful story of redemption and how even the worst person can change
for the best of causes. It&#39;s the director&#39;s best work and one of the
greatest films ever made (certainly one of the most ambitious). Do we
need to watch? Yes, unless you prefer the limited ability of a history
book. 10/10 <br /><br />&quot;This list is gold. This list is life&quot;-Schindler&#39;s List
