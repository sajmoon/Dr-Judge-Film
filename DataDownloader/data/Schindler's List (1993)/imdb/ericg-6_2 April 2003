Don't get me wrong, Shindler was a great man who did some amazing things
in
his efforts to save some Jews from certain death. I just wish Speilberg
didn't feel the need to alter an already compelling story. For example,
the
at the end of the movie...Shindler left with a whole lot of money, which
he
could probably have used to save even more people, but elected not to.
This
should not in any way detract from what he did, but it, among other
scenes,
made the movie a fundamentally dishonest one.
