I went out and saw this at the bargain theaters back a long time ago.  Back
then, I thought it was a excellent movie, well based on the life of one man
and the lives he saved.<br /><br />I got a chance to see it again recently and thought I might add my own
comments to the mix.  I found it a very good movie, however, it was slow in
places for me.  I felt myself getting real tired at some junctions in the
movie.<br /><br />I really love movies like this though.  Liam played the part of his
character very well and the plot was well defined.  I would definetly see it
again, but it isn't as good as other movies I have seen.<br /><br />8 out of 10
