Schindler's List was Spielberg's confirmation as one of America's best
storytellers. Despite Spielberg's extraordinary body of work, straight drama
was one of his shall we say, less successful line of storytelling. Yes, The
Color Purple was a fine film, but at times it showed Spielberg's desire to
overendow the viewer with his good intentions. This was also the case with
his Empire of the sun.<br /><br />Spielberg doesn't seem to believe in evil, unless it is cardbox evil as in
Raiders... So, how do you tell a story about evil without going overboard
and try to usurp the viewers with your statement?<br /><br />Spielberg used the best way of storytelling. He based his film on characters
and not around scenes or plotlines. His characters flourish as the story
enfolds them. Yet on two occasions in the film Spielberg forgets about his
storyline and inserts two scenes to portray the real persona of his story.
First, you have a scene where Ralph Fiennes shows his affection for his
young housemaid. Obviously Spielberg's intent was to show us the nature of
this character. Unfortunatly this doesn't work, because from our own
backround and the story itself, we know the nature of that character and
this scene breaks the rhythm and the credibility of his story. The second
scene is the end, where cast and crew present their respect to the dead.
This is all nice and well, but it makes you realize that you've been
watching a piece of fiction and therefore the movie loses some of it's
unbearable strength.<br /><br />Visualy the film is Spielberg's best and once again he states himself as an
extraordinary actors director. Pitty that Spielberg has that desire to tell
us more than we need to know. But despite these flaws Schindler's List ranks
among the best of modern
moviemaking.
