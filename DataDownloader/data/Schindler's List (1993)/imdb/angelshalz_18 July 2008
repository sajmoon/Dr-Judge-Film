Schindler&#39;s List should be a punishment: a chastisement for not reading
your textbooks properly about the Holocaust: a horrible genocide in
which more than 6 million Jews were killed: an immense population. It
gives us a very visual outlook of the inhumanity which was faced in the
concentration camps. Taken like a documentary with black and white
photography, Schindler&#39;s List is scary because it is real. There is
also this chilling background music composition mixing Jewish hymns
(very, very solemn) and another sad score by John Williams. I watched
this in my history class in case you were wondering. So, should you
watch this movie? I am not recommending it to high school students
who&#39;ve already read &quot;Night&quot; or learned in depth about the process of
Hitler&#39;s &quot;Final Solution&quot; unless they find it interesting. In fact, I
think &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot; is a more uplifting movie to watch in order
to heal our sorrow after reading about Auschwitz and all those
treacherous Jewish ghettos. Oh yeah, the actors in Schindler&#39;s List
were brilliant: very convincing. The setting was brilliant. The ending
was in my opinion the best part of the movie, so if you start watching
it, don&#39;t stop during the middle because of the atrocities.
