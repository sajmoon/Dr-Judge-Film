This movie treats one of the most important subjects of our century, i.e.
the national socialist movement in europe which could have ended up in a
disaster. <br /><br />The acting and the cinematography are as good as it gets! However, since the
purpose of the film is to be some kind of document on what happened in the
camps in Germany and Poland during the nazi-period, I find the fact that
Spielberg is making up things in the movie, such as the shooting of innocent
jews from the balcony of a residence, somehow takes away much of its value
as a document over history. My opinion is that there is no need for making
up things and making them worse than they actually were in order to make a
good movie about this era. Things were bas enough as they were; there is no
need for making things up, especially things that couldn't even have
happened (the location of the villa makes it impossible to shoot jews from
the balcony). <br /><br />To conclude: I find this to be a movie, well worth seing! However, it is not
to be seen as a documentation of what really happened, which in my opinion
is very unfortunate since that would have given this movie yet another
dimension. In my eyes, this dimension would compensated for the loss of some
of the more dramatic scenes in the movie. I guess my historian background
somehow blew it for me. <br /><br />
