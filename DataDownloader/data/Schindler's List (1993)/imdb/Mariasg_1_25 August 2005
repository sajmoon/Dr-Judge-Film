I just saw the film for the very first time today (25/8-05) and i
regret that i have never seen it before. This is one of the most
brilliant films i have ever seen, it shows true emotions from the
actors (Who plays awesome). Schindler's List has just been added to my
personal top 10 list! If you have not seen this, DO IT! Schindler is a
person i would have liked to know! He saved all these people but still
he wanted to save more. A pure heart of gold!! I love this film, it
gives a good glint of how awful i must have been to be a Jew in that
war, god rest the souls of every single one of them! A thing i don't
get though, is how the Germans could lie about killing all of these
people.
