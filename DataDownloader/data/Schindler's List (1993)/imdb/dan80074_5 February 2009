This movie is Spielberg&#39;s best movie and that says a lot. His direction
is flawless (although he was averse to direct it) as is the movie. The
choice for black and white was great. Those who say its fictional and
that isn&#39;t how it was and I have no idea what they are talking about.
Nazis hated and killed Jews during WWII. Thats exactly what the movie
shows and in the middle of it all was a man named Oscar Schindler who
really did fool the Nazis by bribing them. His spent millions and saved
thousands and it really happened. And Schindler knew a man named Amon
Goeth who was a psycho Nazi. The men who played these guys played them
as close to perfection as possible. Liam Neeson was fabulous as the man
who first cared for nothing but money and his heart was changed after
the horror he witnessed (but respectively lost to Tom Hanks for
Philadelphia). Ralph Fiennes was great as the crazy Nazi and truly made
the performance believable. This movie is probably the greatest movie
of the 90s and should have reminded most people at the time that not
all modern movies are sub par. The three hour and change epic goes up
there with the greats.
