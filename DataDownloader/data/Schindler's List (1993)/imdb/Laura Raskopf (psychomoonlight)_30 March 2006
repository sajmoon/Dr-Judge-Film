I seen this movie...<br /><br />It made you open your eyes. For once, torture CAN happen. If someone
says they were going to kill someone, serious or not, they should of
paid attention to Hitler.<br /><br />But anyway...<br /><br />I advise seeing this movie, only if you can gut shootings and also can
accept the fact that we may never know what really gone on in the
holocaust.<br /><br />Life can go on... Life can go on with knowing what has happened to
these people. For something being black and white...this is a really
powerful movie. Forget the football players and other &quot;heroes&quot; in the
world...These people, who survive...are heroes...for not ditching their
faith.
