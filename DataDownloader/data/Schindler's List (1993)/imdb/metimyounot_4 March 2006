I weep a little bit more each time I see it.<br /><br />I've given up trying to explain it to my intelligent friends that have
yet to see it.<br /><br />It occupies a rarefied movie space along with Star Wars, Cuckoo's Nest,
Casablanca, Spinal Tap and Patton. In my world at least.<br /><br />That's all I have to say about Schindler's List.<br /><br />However. As much fun as it is to play the rank the movie game (or the
rank the anything game for that matter), I've decided that it's a
limited way of looking at things. There's no inherent need to stratify. <br /><br />I find it preferable to acknowledge certain examples of things as
holding an elevated status in my pantheon. Once something reaches that
level, there's no need to differentiate between the brethren (or,
sistren, if you prefer).
