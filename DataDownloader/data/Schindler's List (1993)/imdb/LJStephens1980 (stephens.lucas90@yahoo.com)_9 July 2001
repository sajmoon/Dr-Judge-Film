Having read Schindler's Ark, by Thomas Keneally in early 1994, I wanted to
see the flim, hoever my parents persuaded me not to.<br /><br />When I first saw this, I came away emotionally, and physically drained.
Speielburg creates a very real atomosphere by having it flimed in black &amp;
white, and some of the flim is very hard to sit through.<br /><br />Spielberg has a first rate cast in Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Embeth
Davidtz
and Ralph Finnes.<br /><br />I also cannot go past John Williams brillant soundtrack. It is one of the
very few soundtracks in my collection, and I am very proud to have
it.<br /><br />Schindler's List gets 9/10, and although it may not be a family flim, it
is
one of the best, no question about it.
