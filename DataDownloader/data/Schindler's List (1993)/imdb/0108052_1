I know many of you, out there will disagree with me, when I say that
Schindler&#x27;s List is one of the greatest film that there has ever been.
It does sound that I&#x27;m extremely overrating it, but I truly believe
that Schindler&#x27;s List is up there with The Godfather and Citizen Kane I
mean everything about is so good, that its close to perfection.<br /><br />The acting is brilliant, every actor does an amazing job. Liam Neeson
as Schindler is incredible, no doubt about it. He should of won an
Oscar for Best Actor. Ralph Fiennes is the one, who truly is the best
actor in the film. He plays his antagonist role as Amon Goeth, so well
that it is a travesty, he didn&#x27;t win an Oscar for Best Supporting
Actor.<br /><br />I&#x27;m happy though, that the Academy chose this film for Best Picture, it
was one of the best decisions they ever made. Because if this film
wasn&#x27;t considered Best Picture by the Academy, I don&#x27;t know which film
would be, expect maybe for The Godfather.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg certainly deserved an Oscar for Best Director. It was
a smart idea for Steven Spielberg to make this film in black-white
because it made the movie more bleak, emotional, hopelessness. But you
see small patches of color -- A candle and a child&#x27;s coat bringing the
evilness of the tragedy into a agonizing focus.<br /><br />There&#x27;s no doubt about it, this film will be a classic in decades, even
hundreds of years to come in cinema. This film is without a doubt, the
Best film that Spielberg has ever made. With many other Steven
Spielberg&#x27;s classics like Jurassic Park,Jaws,E.T, Raider of the Lost
Ark, Saving Private Ryan, etc. Schindler&#x27;s List will always be Steven
Spielberg&#x27;s most finest, important film. He blends his humanism to the
tragic horror of the Holocaust to create an emotional masterpiece.<br /><br />10/10 Absolutely Recommended!
