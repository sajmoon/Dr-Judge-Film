This film is unique, inspiring, haunting, and ... well, long, all at
once. It differentiates itself from all other movies that have so far
been made about the Holocaust. Why? Little things like filming in black
and white, John William's amazing score, and a look at the perspective
of the Nazis, which is uncommon.<br /><br />Not only is the story beautiful, but it is reinforced by wonderful
performances from the actors, good dialogue and music.<br /><br />Go see this movie. It will change the way you see things. It makes the
victims of the Holocaust as well as the Nazis real people, instead of
generalizing like our modern day does without knowing it.
