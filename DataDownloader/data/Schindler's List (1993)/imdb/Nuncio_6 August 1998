I was very doubtful about watching this one because I have a strange case of
 allergies to most of those Spielberg's movies (except the old ones of
 course), but what a nice surprise to see a well made film with a very good
 script and a deep sense of humanity's fragilities, so dark and so realistic
 that it leaves us with the question of how far down can we go in the future
 if we've already been in the bottom in the past?
