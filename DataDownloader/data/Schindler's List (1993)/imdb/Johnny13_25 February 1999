I can't understand why everyone in the world thinks this movie is so great.
It took me three attempts to watch it all the way through without falling
asleep.  I only wish Spielberg would make entertaining movies like E.T.
instead of long, dull epics which focus on dried-up historical injustice
(Amistad, Saving Private Ryan, etc.). <br /><br />6/10
