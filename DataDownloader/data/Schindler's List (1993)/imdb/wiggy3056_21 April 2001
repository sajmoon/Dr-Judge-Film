Just simply one of the all time great movies! Liam Neeson performance,what
can you say,but awesome. The scene at the end when he breaks down say
he could have save more Jews alone earned him the Oscar. Ben Kingsley was
also brillant. Ralph Fiennes as hateful
as on screen villian,brillant! I1m not Jewish but I`m driven to tears every
time I watch it.
