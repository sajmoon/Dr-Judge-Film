The story of Oskar Schinlder, a German by birth who wants to make money
in WW II by getting Jewish investors and workers to produce pots and
pans in a factory.<br /><br />The performances are outstanding. Liam Neeson is Oskar and he is
wonderful. Ralph Fiennes is the Nazi camp commander and his performance
personifying evil is astounding. Ben Kingsley, one of the great actors
of ANY era, is magnificent as Stern, the accountant who helps Oskar and
at the same time stays under everyone&#39;s radar while helping his people
during their incarceration.<br /><br />I could go on and on but that basically describes it. I give it the
greatest compliment I could ever give a movie: DON&#39;T MISS IT!
