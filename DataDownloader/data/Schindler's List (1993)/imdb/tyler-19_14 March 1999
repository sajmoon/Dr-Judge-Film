<br /><br />This movie was an experience that should never be forgotten. My English
teacher recommended that we should see this movie since we are studying the
events of WWII and I am glad she did. This movie gives a better glimpse into
what actually happened during  the Holocaust although not everything. The
movie was wonderful except for the scenes with sex in it. I don't think that
was needed but overall it was great!<br /><br />10/10
