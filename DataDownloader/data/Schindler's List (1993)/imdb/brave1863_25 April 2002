&quot;Schindler's List&quot; without a doubt has been one of the best movies I have
ever seen. I am glad that it won a lot of Oscars including Best Picture and
Best Director Steven Spielberg. Liam Neeson is an excellent in that film
also. Neeson stars as a Nazi Czech/German businessman named Oskar Schindler
who owns a factory and saved more than 1100 Jews from being gassed at the
Auschwitz concentration camp during the Holocaust. Concentration camp is a
very bad place where people work on digging the dirt from sunrise to sunset.
It is a sad film, but it is based on a true story and it is brilliant, too.
&quot;Schindler's List&quot; is a movie that should be seen for any Liam Neeson, Ben
Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes, Steven Spielberg, or any historical drama film or
movie fans. Excellent! Tragic Ending with Jews putting rocks on Oskar
Schindler's gravestone in the cemetery.<br /><br />10/10
