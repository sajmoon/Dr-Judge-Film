Spielberg&#x27;s List: (1) This is a SERIOUS film so shoot it in black and
white (except for some gimmicky use of color) with such stark contrast
between extremely bright artificial lighting and darkness that every
scene screams ARTIST AT WORK. (2) To make it clear that the Nazis were
evil, have a scene where they randomly shoot Jews. And another scene.
And another and another... (3) To really drive home the point that this
is an IMPORTANT film about a SOMBRE topic, fill it with enough
repetitive scenes that it lasts nearly as long as WWII. (4) Rinse. (5)
Repeat. Schindler was no doubt a great man, but his saintliness is way
overdone. Neeson is fine, but Fiennes chews the scenery.
