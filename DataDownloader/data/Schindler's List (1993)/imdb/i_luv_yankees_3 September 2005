Speilburg's done it again! This breath taking movie shows the journey
of a business man Oskar Schindler) living the good life until he faces
reality and it is up to him to decide the fate of thousand's of Jewish
folk who are suffering unnecessarily to the cause of religion. He tries
to stop the genocide by buying them from cruel Aman Goeth who will have
them sent to the Jewish concentration camp Auschwitz. This movie will
literally take your breath away. It will make you cry and smile. It
will hurt you inside as well. Liam Neeson gives a spectacular
performance as Oskar Schindler. Ralph Fiennes portrayal of Aman Goeth
is very accurate and his acting is exceptionally well. This film is in
black and white but it is so for a reason (It dramatizes the effect).
*There is a lot of gore, blood and nudity*
