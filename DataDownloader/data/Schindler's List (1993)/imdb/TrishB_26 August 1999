I only saw 'Schindler's List' for the first time in April 1999. I had
dismissed it as an attempt to tug at heartstrings.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong.I watched this movie and felt horror, shame and relief.
It
inspired me to apply (as a mature age student) to University to study
History, in order to try and understand this period in human
history.<br /><br />I wasn't interested in the Holocaust when I watched it - I was more
interested in Liam Neeson. But since then I have made an effort to try and
understand it from the three different angles - the Nazis, the Jews, and
the
Rest of the World.<br /><br />Awake your social conscience and watch this movie. If you've already
watched
it and can't understand what I'm saying, then read some accounts of the
Holocaust - try 'The Diary of Anne Frank' - then watch it
again.<br /><br />It has had a profound effect on how I view and judge people.
