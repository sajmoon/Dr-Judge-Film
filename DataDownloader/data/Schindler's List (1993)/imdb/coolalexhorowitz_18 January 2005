It's a great movie and i recommended it to anyone who wants to see a
beautiful film about the great tragedies of the holocaust. This film's
only &quot;bad thing&quot; is that it's in black and white but this believe it or
not gives it even more beauty. I think that this movie is suitable for
kids 12 and up if they are watching it with their parents. Also
remember that is film is based on a true story. Schindler was a man who
helped the Nazis in many ways (suplying weapons etc)but he did not
think that what was being done to the Jews was right so he helped many
of them who are still alive today and many who left their children to
tell the story.
