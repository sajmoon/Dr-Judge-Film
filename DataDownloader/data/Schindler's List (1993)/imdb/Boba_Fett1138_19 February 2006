&#x22;Schindler&#x27;s List&#x22; is a powerful movie that is a reminder to the world
of where hatred can lead to. The movie shows the Holocaust in the most
powerful and confronting way possible. It doesn&#x27;t hold back with its
images or story. In that regard &#x22;Schindler&#x27;s List&#x22; is a daring movie
but the end result is more powerful than you could have ever imagined.
The movie tells the true story of Nazi-party member Oskar Schindler,
who as the war progresses sees more and more horrors of the Holacaust
and decides to help the Jews in the best way possible for him.<br /><br />&#x22;Schindler&#x27;s List&#x22; is honestly one of the movie powerful movies ever
created. Since almost everything in the movie is based on true events
it makes it all even more powerful. It&#x27;s hard to imaging that these
horrible things all actually truly occurred. The movie is filled with
graphic, confronting and humiliating images. It provides the movie with
some unforgettable sequences that will leave a lasting impression on
you. Never has the Holocaust been brought to the silver screen in such
a detailed and confronting way. Not everyone will be able to handle
watching &#x22;Schindler&#x27;s List&#x22;. It really is not a movie for the faint of
heart.<br /><br />Spielberg delivers with this movie his most important and perhaps also
most personal and best movie. The storytelling of the movie is perfect
and the way it focuses on the many characters of the movie is spot-on.
It follows many different Jewish characters who all had their different
experiences.<br /><br />Yes, the movie does become over-sentimental at times, especially toward
the ending but in this case I forgive Spielberg. It in no way makes the
movie any less powerful or meaningful. The message of the movie comes
trough very hard and direct. Everyone should watch this movie, not only
because it&#x27;s such a good one but especially because it&#x27;s a very
important one.<br /><br />The movie is filmed in black &#x26; white. I think main reason for this was
to make the movie look less graphic, since the main essence of the
movie should not be on the graphic images but on the confronting and
realistic emotions of history. It&#x27;s not a movie that tries to shock,
it&#x27;s a movie that confronts in a very direct way instead. Whatever the
real true reason was for making the movie in black &#x26; white, it works
really well for the movie its time period and atmosphere. The lighting
of director of photography Janusz Kaminski is really phenomenal at
times. Also the dramatic musical score by John Williams is impressive
and makes some of the sequences work even extra powerful.<br /><br />Also the acting is great in this movie. The Jewish persons are mostly
played by unknown and unexperienced actors. It makes them. in their
roles, extra credible and believable. We see them as persons, not as
actors playing persons. That&#x27;s also another reason why the movie works
powerful, the characters are all very real. Not only the Jews but also
the Nazi-Germans. The movie launched the careers of both Liam Neeson
and Ralph Fiennes. Liam Neeson is great as the main lead and Ralph
Fiennes is truly chilling as the camp commander Amon Goeth. Another
fine impressive role is being played by Ben Kingsley.<br /><br />Among the best movies of the 20th century but more important, it&#x27;s a
very important movie that reminds us of what happened- and should never
happen again.<br /><br />10/10<br /><br />http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/
