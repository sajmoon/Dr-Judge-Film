Watched this one in the dorm via UWRF campus cable station.  Yeah, this was
great and that was great, but I honestly can't remember much from it.  Only
two scenes, in fact.  One with the execution outside the factory and one at
the end with the pin on Schindler's coat.<br /><br />I thought maybe it seemed bland to me because I was watching on my little
old b&amp;w unit, but later I found out the whole movie was in b&amp;w, so I'd have
to say it just wasn't very entertaining.<br /><br />I'd rather watch a documentary about this stuff.  I just didn't grasp the
tragedy of it on account of the film, i.e., I didn't forget that it was just
a movie, which would be important here.
