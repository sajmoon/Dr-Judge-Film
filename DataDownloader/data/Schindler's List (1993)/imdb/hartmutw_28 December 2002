Oh my, this movie is so full of stereotypes and cliches that I won't even
start listing them here.<br /><br />How dare Spielberg making a movie for easy mass-consumption on such a
delicate subject? Being from Germany I feel particularly offended by the way
Jews and Germans are portrayed: Everything is like a person that never had
dealt with any of these cultures in depth would imagine it from watching
just another US movie on the Holocaust. That might be fine for a TV-series
or soap opera, but is pretty poor for a movie of that caliber.<br /><br />Not that I really expected anything but a streamlined feel-good movie by
that director, but I find it very offensive to use such a subject just to
finally get the Oscar. Disappointing!
