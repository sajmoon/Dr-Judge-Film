In the peak of the Second World War, one non-Jewish man strives for
justice
for the Jewish people who are being inhumanly slaughtered. Oskar Schindler
produces a list on a 1000+ names of Jewish beings whom he would like to
work
in his factory. The list is genius and saves many people from the realms
of
the Nazi reign. The film has superb cinematography, directing, music,
editing and more. But most of all the performances are astounding. Liam
Neeson as Schindler is absolutely astounding and as is Ben Kingsley as
Itzhak Stern. Their performances are by far, perfect. Embeth Davidtz is
amazing as Helen Hirsch. She gives the viewer a million reasons to shed
tears. However I was most taken up by the performance of Ralph Fiennes who
portrays the chilling Nazi officer Amon Goeth. Fiennes gives a sense of
fear
and yet he is appealing. Never before have a cast been so
perfect.
This film is definitely the greatest film of all time. Thank you Mr
Speilberg for producing such a real and beautiful film!
