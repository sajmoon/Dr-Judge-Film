  Its an irony that though I am an avid watcher of good and excellent
movies, I only happened to watch this MASTERPIECE in 2002 even though it was
produced in 1993.And I am repenting for the nine years I wasted in between,
before I watched this MASTERPIECE in an Oscar festival in a local theatre
here in Mumbai.<br /><br />  This movie is one of my most favourite masterpieces(mind you,I am saying
'masterpieces' and not 'movies' because I have painfully selected my
'favourite' masterpieces from all the movies I HAVE watched, and then AGAIN
filtered and selected my 'personal 40 most favourite MASTERPIECES of all
time' from those favourites).<br /><br />  ' SCHINDLER'S LIST ' is my choice along with Life Is Beautiful(1997);  The
Sixth Sense(1999);  The Godfather 2(1974);  Braveheart(1995);  Se7en(1995); 
Crimson Tide(1995);  Unbreakable(2000);  Crouching Tiger, Hidden
Dragon(2000);  The Great Dictator(1940);  Terminator 2:Judgement Day(1991); 
Dog Day Afternoon(1975);  Kramer Vs.Kramer(1979);  Saving Private
Ryan(1998);  Artificial Intelligence(2001);  Raging Bull(1980); 
Philadelphia(1993) and many more ...!<br /><br />   Usually, I don't approve myself of providing ranks to my 'personal 40
Favourite Masterpieces of All Time' but this one is an EXCEPTION and I rank
this movie as 'The Number One'.<br /><br />My humble suggestion : 1. To all those who had the luck of watching this
masterpiece before - DON'T WAIT. GO and BUY a CD or a DVD whatever you get
your hands on and enjoy this movie for your lifetime. 
 2. To those who haven't yet watched IT - DON'T WAIT, GO and RENT IT / watch
IT in a theatre on the very first chance you get.
And now PLEASE don't complaint of not having enough money to buy or even
rent it. SELL YOUR CHILDREN IF YOU NEED TO GET MONEY BUT DON'T WAIT FOR THE
NEXT NINE YEARS TO WATCH THIS MASTERPIECE. 
 
Needless to say, I rate this masterpiece a 10 out of 10.
