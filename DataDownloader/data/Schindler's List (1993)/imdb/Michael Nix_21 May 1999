I saw this movie in Nevada when it first came out and since i am a german,
it
touched me probably even more than the whole audience. During the
intermission two americans were standing next to me talking to each
other.&quot;This cannot be true&quot;, &quot;No, Spielberg probably exaggerated, it is
Hollywood&quot;
That touched me even more. Spielberg showed the Holocaust as true as it
was,
as brutal as it was and as merciless as it was. It is an awesome movie to
learn about history, since in school everything is only from books and so
far away. Spielberg did the same in Saving Private Ryan, Another way of
teaching people abou that period of time.
We owe Steven Spielberg a lot. He keeps history alive and let us not
forget.
