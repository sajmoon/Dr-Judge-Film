Steven Spielberg showed he could make grown-up movies with this powerful
drama about the Holocaust and about one of the handful of people who tried
to save Jews rather than kill them or allow them to be killed during this
time.  It's unflinching in looking at the nature of good and the nature of
evil.  The good is represented, at its most unlikely, in the form of Oskar
Schindler, a womanizer, boozer, charmer, and money-grubber who nonetheless
manages to do one good thing and save over a thousand lives.  Contrary to
what some people have commented, he is not presented as a saint, but as a
complex, enigmatic human being, and Liam Neeson plays him that way
splendidly.  I do agree the scene where Schindler wishes he could have saved
more feels misguided, but that's my only complaint about the film.<br /><br />On the other side of the coin is Ralph Fiennes, in an absolute chilling
portrayal, as Amon Goeth, who represents evil here.  Yet like Schindler, his
is not a simplistic portrayal, but is someone who doesn't feel anything,
except contempt and maybe a little greed.  He kills not out of pathology but
rather out of boredom.  The only time we see any feelings come over him is
when he decides, as an experiment, to spare people who do wrong, rather than
kill them, and it shakes him, so he goes back to killing.  Also he's undone
by Helen Hirsch, his maid, so he lashes out at her even more than if it was
just some servant.  The genius of the movie is to see him and Schindler as
closer than we would like to think.  Also, Ben Kingsley is very good.<br /><br />Spielberg was trying to bring the reality of the Holocaust to people who didn't know about it, and maybe were being bombarded by all the hate groups who
are spreading a disinformation campaign by saying it never happened.  And I think he suceeded brilliantly.
