When I was done with seeing this movie I realized that I had stayed
glued to the screen for 3 hours without my attention getting
diverted.The acting especially from Liam Neeson as Oskar and Ralph
Fiennes as Amon Goethe is a notch above anything I have seen.<br /><br />When one realizes that Oskar Schindler,a man who initially started out
with the intention of making a quick buck out of the war situation and
who after having failed in earlier businesses must obviously be
determined to do well this time around, gives up all his money,his
fortune and his shot at a good life in order to save the lives of
people who were being cruelly butchered,one is moved,deeply moved.<br /><br />The scenes of the massacre of the ghetto and the way the people trying
to hide were systematically hunted down are disturbing scenes..yet they
serve to elevate the viewing experience and also are stark brutal
reminders of the depravity humans are capable of.<br /><br />With the rising intolerance the world over this movie acts as a
reminder,a warning and also a beacon of hope.it is both a testimonial
to what one man&#39;s conviction is capable of...on the one hand we have
Schindler who almost singlehandedly saves 1200 Jews and on the other we
have Hitler who is responsible for the near extermination of Jews.
