I must say that I was not alive when the Holocaust took place but have
heard
all the horror stories. This film put pictures together with the horror
stories. It is an epic, filmed in black and white for effect purposes,
which
will not be forgotten. Ralph Fiennes, Ben Kingsley and Liam Neeson are
all
casted beautifully in their roles. This is a film that will leave you
thinking and is required viewing for those, like myself, who weren't
around
when this atrocity took place.<br /><br />My rating : @@@@ 1/2 (out of five)
