Quite simply, one of the finest films ever committed to celluloid.
Spielberg
perfectly marries his now fully-matured filmmaking style with a small
scale,
humanistic, (and as-yet unsurpassed) perspective on the worst period in
human history.<br /><br />And if either Tom Hanks or Tommy Lee Jones think that they will ever be
forgiven for robbing, repectively, Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes of Best
Actor and Best Supporting Actor in 1993 for their performances in
Philadelphia and The Fugitive(?!), they ae sorely mistaken. I thank you.
