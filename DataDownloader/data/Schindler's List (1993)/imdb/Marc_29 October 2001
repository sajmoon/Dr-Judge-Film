A perfect film in every way.  I left the cinema, as did 99% of the audience
in silence.
This film is a, despite the subject matter, a feel good movie.  Yes the
events &amp; actions &amp; suffering are all there, but the power of the human
spirit shines through.  This film shows that you can make a difference, you
can make things better.  I have been inspired to make a difference since
seeing this film &amp; plan to continue to do so.
