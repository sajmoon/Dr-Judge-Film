This movie has to be Spielberg's best movie ever. This movie cannot be
explained in words. Simply put, it is breath taking as well as touching.
There are so many scenes that create such feelings of disbelief to joy to
sadness. If you love movies and you HAVE NOT seen this film, truly there
is
something wrong with you. When Spielberg's career is over and when it is
all
said and done, this will be the film that will define his career. Enough
of
me, you must go out and buy this video (as it is not on DVD at the
present
moment)and watch it over and over again. Then when it comes out on DVD,
you
can buy that too.<br /><br />Outstanding. 10/10!<br /><br />
