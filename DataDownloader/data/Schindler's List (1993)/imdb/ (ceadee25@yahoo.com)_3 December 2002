On my list, this is one of the greatest movie that depicts
the horrors of war. Its black and white cinematography used in the film
reminds me the images of the dark ages. And everyone who watched this film
would somehow realized that life is much more precious than wealth. And
one
man named Schindler used his wealth and influence to save the
Jews.
Schindler's List is more than a movie than I've expected. It depicts the
realities of war, and most of all, showing that 'Life Is
Precious'.<br /><br />
