&quot;Schindler's List&quot; is one of the best movies of all time according to the
people who write the reviews for this site, which isn't a big surprise.  I
happen to be one of those people who voted 10, but some didn't enjoy it
and
I know a few people who wouldn't watch this movie, which is understandable
due to what this film is about.<br /><br />This is a truly brilliant film, and I think it's the best film ever
directed
by Steven Speilberg.  It's powerful, it explains a lot, it has a solid
cast.
Liam Neeson gives a brilliant and Oscar-worthy performance (it's
disappointing that he lost) as Mr. Schindler himself.  What I thought was
interesting was how every bit of detail was explained and how the movie is
black and white rather than color (which is a terrific idea if you ask
me).
There are a lot of interesting things about this movie, and that's number
one reason why I loved &quot;Schindler's List&quot;.  This movie never fails to
amaze
me!<br /><br />There is not one part in this film that I dislike.  I can't say anything
bad
about &quot;Schindler's List&quot;.  If you see this movie, you might just be as
impressed by it as much as I was! :o)
