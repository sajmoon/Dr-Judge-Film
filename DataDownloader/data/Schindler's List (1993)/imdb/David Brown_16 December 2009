Schindler&#x27;s List is easily one of Spielberg&#x27;s finest efforts as a
filmmaker, the horrors of the holocaust are portrayed in full
unrelenting detail guided by Spielberg&#x27;s visionary directorial hand and
this film most definitely deserved the 7 Oscars it received.
Performances by Neeson, Fiennes and Kingsly are fantastic and memorable
but I think Fiennes delivered the best performance of his career as the
heartless, psychotic nazi officer Amon Goeth, his scenes steal the
screen and are the ones you won&#x27;t soon forget after the credits roll.
Schindler&#x27;s List is the work of master and is masterfully crafted on
all counts, this is an unforgettable, iconic film that simply cannot be
missed.
