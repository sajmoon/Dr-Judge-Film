There has been a long-standing debate whether the holocaust could ever be
captured in a meaningful way by art. Can an esthetic form be used to
describe its antithesis? What should be the purpose of an artistic
rendering? Spielberg has proven that the artist can convey the impact of
this event that leaves a lasting imprint on the viewer. By selecting an
isolated event, the fate of the 1,000 Schindler Jews, Spielberg allows an
oblique glance at the vast enterprise of this historically unique genocide.
The understated tone of the picture and the brief allusions to the
well-known horrors of the time,while concentrating on a small group of
protagonists allows the viewer's imagination and emotions to experience the
atmosphere of the time in a profound way. The most gripping scene is the
evacuation of the Krakow ghetto. During the mayhem of soldiers, gunfire,
attack dogs and terrified victims a small girl walks through the black and
white scene in a spot of color. Six million victims are not fathomable, but
one little girl can represent them all. Spielberg has shown the power of
art
to describe the indescribable.
