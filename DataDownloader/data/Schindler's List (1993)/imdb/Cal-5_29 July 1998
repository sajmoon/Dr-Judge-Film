The words &quot;The Greatest Film Ever&quot; hardly describes Steven Spielberg's
 masterpiece about the Holocaust during World War II. This by far is
 Spielberg's crowning achievement. Schindler's List is, also, the most
 beautifully photographed film ever. It's black-and-white cinematography
 adds to the film's unreal authenticity. Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, and Ben
 Kingsley add three of the greatest film performances ever. This is a film
 that everyone should watch.
