Rather than impress you (the reader) with a grandeur review of the movie,
I
will sum up what the people are saying about this movie called Schindler's
List.<br /><br />It's brilliant, beautifully shot in black and white, but it's a Spielberg
film, it did have it's share of flaws.<br /><br />Despite the many rants from other users saying that &quot;if it's Spielberg, it
mustn't be that good,&quot; I still can't understand why people would rate this
film with the lowest rating possible(1 out of 10, which = awful
movie).<br /><br />I rated this film a 10 out of 10.  Why?  &quot;Now come on, Dude, it's a
Hollywood Movie&quot; I was told by a fellow student in school.  Yes, but when
was the last time any Hollywood made a movie like this?  When was the last
time you saw a Hollywood Movie that was actually worth watching for 3
whole
hours?  I appreciate that any kind of film that is anything as dramatic as
this can actually get made in Hollywood today, let alone get made way back
in 1993.  I find this film great for the fact that this doesn't stick to
every Hollywood stereotype, cliche, bullsh**, and lie that seems to fill
most Hollywood Movies.<br /><br />Flaws.  Let's face it, pretty much every film has them, even a huge movie
loving geek like myself knows that.  Yes, the ending is a bit
pretentious(but I felt that the ending for Saving Private Ryan was a bit
pretentious too, though I still think that it's also an excellent film).
Having seen this a few times already I can see where the arguments over
the
character lacking enough depth and being rather 2-dimensional have some
truth in them.<br /><br />Schindler's List, like any other film, has flaws.  Truth is that any film,
whether it be directed by Kubrick, Stone, Tarantino, Malick, or Spielberg,
will most likely have flaws no matter how noticeable or unnoticeable they
are.<br /><br />What I feel after several viewings.  Despite the films flaws, it stands
out
as a very moving, well-intentioned, strong, excellent, and remarkable
film.
See if you want to, nobody is forcing you to see this movie.  I, like many
others who haven't fallen into the &quot;Everything that is Spielberg sucks&quot;
crowd, can't deny what a powerful film this is and what a great
contribution
to movie cinema history it is.
