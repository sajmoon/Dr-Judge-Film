Hello, I am a student in high school and I would like to comment on the
movie, Schindler's List. In one scene when a man is done raping a
child, you see him zippering up his pants. In the 4 and a half years of
the holocaust's existence there was no such thing as a zipper on men's
pants... there were only buttons. Other than that, the movie was
perfect. The little girl's red coat was an amazing way to show
symbolism and i think the movie was made beautifully. My favorite part
of the way the movie was executed was when the Nazi's spoke German. At
the most hectic and chaotic times in the movie (ex. the liquidation of
the Jews in Krakow) the Nazi's spoke German! I think that was a perfect
touch because I felt like I was one of the Jews, I felt as if I was a
part of the frenzy!<br /><br />Thanks for reading!
