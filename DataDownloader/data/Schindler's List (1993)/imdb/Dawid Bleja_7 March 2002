As possibly the world's most influential film-maker, Spielberg has a
responsibility. And that responsibility entails NOT using his cheesy,
shallow sensibilities to turn one of the most profoundly horrible parts of
human history into a soap opera-style piece of fluff. This film is more than
just a bad film, it is a downright dangerously bad film that will be watched
by millions of impressionable people who might have had few other sources to
base their knowledge of the Holocaust on. Most of us agree that the worst
thing to do about something like the Holocaust is to forget it, lest it
happen again. The next worst thing is to trivialise it to the point where it
resembles so many other Hollywood pieces of trash.<br /><br />What possesses a man who has become rich and powerful in the film industry
solely through the making of shallow, transparent films for children to
think that he is talented and wise enough to present to the masses a subject
which should only be touched by the most careful and socially responsible
hands? A Mid-life crisis, and an over-inflated ego, most likely, not that it
matters though.<br /><br />Only someone with many years of study may be a doctor; only an experienced
engineer may build a bridge, and even the guy who fixes your toilet must be
a qualified plumber. Yet this fool, whose only previous qualifications have
been cheap, shallow, movies made strictly for entertainment, thinks he is in
a rightful position to educate our children. Because, unfortunately, many
people have a frighteningly limited amount of knowledge about the second
world war, and Schindler's List will be for many of them their main source
of information. Showing it to them in as cheesy and hollow a fashion as
almost only Spielberg can, is simply a crime.<br /><br />
