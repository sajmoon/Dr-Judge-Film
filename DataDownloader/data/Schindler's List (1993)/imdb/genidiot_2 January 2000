   I hate to go with the flow but this film is so well made that it belongs
on the top 5 lists of all drama lovers. &quot;Schindler's List&quot; is so delicately
created and so masterfully crafted that I personally feel that it sets the
standard for all films to come. Characters like Schindler, Stern, and Goeth
leave a lasting impression on the viewer. Neeson's Schindler who changes
character so convincingly and smoothly (in the style of Al Pacino's Michael
Corleone), Kingsley's Stern who fascinates and fuels the fire of deep
emotion in this movie, and finally Fiennes as the demonicly evil Goeth who
in a beautiful performance causes us to see how brutal Nazi officers could
really be. As the movie continues and the characters become fully developed,
the viewer realizes with such an intense clarity that the Holocaust was no
joke, no fairy tale. Steven Spielberg created a film that will remain in the
heart of America's movie making history. Also, while &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot;
may be John Williams' most memorable scores, this is definitely his most
powerful. I have only seen two movies (The Godfather Part II and The Thin
Red Line) that compare to this. *****
