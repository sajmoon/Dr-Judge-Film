I saw Schindler&#x27;s list in Religion, our teachers wanted to show the
evil in our world. Schindlers list did exactly what was asked of it, it
showed the horrors of war and it showed how good can prevail. <br /><br />The acting is spot on, Liam Neeson manages to put on a great show as
our protagonist Oskar Schindler but I must mention Ralph Fiennes. This
man&#x27;s talents in portraying a &#x22;baddie&#x22; are truly spectacular. Fiennes
manages to show the evil inside Amon Goeth,he is a cold hearted killer
who has no mercy. <br /><br />The black and white filter is also a nice touch, I&#x27;m not exactly sure
what it represents but it may be to represent the fact that war is
pointless. <br /><br />Last of all I have to mention the music score. John Williams managed to
create a score that fit the film perfectly. The music is sad and almost
makes you want to cry. The idea to play iton a violin was smart and
added to the sadness. John Williams truly deserved the Oscar and always
will. <br /><br />Schindlers list is truly a classic,directed by the great Steven
Spielberg it manages to portray the horrors of war, how one man can
make a difference but most important of all it showed hope.
