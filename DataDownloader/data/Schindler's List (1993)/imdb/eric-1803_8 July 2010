I capitalized Mind because Spielberg&#x27;s Mind deserves the respect. Even
if it means sacrificing good grammar. Here&#x27;s the thing, two movies by
the same director were released in 1993: Jurassic Park and Schindler&#x27;s
List. If you were to go to another planet with these two films (sans
credits) and showed them back to back. I have no doubt that whatever
race is seeing them would have no idea that the same man made both
movies in the same year. It&#x27;s an amazing achievement to be able to do
one, really awesome fun blockbuster, to a borderline art-house,
depressing historical semi-epic about an entire civilization (of sorts)
being tortured and killed.<br /><br />This is the clear illustration of Spielberg&#x27;s talents, not necessarily
the film itself (which is exceptional) but that he pulled it off in the
same year as Jurassic Park. WOW.
