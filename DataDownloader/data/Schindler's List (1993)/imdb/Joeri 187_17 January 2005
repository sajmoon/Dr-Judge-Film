Personally I find this is Spielberg's masterpiece. Showing the
monstrosities that took place during the 2nd world war. Of all the
holocaust movies that have ever been made this is the best by far
because this movie has it all showing the emotions of the different
people. Even the sadistic Amon Goeth has emotions he just has problems
handling them. The way he shows the inhuman things that took place is
just spine chilling. Its the best movie of its kind and should be in
any top 10 of the best movies ever where any masterpiece belongs. If
you haven't watched this movie yet you shouldn't be reading this but on
your way to the video store to get this movie.<br /><br />10/10
