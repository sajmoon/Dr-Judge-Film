Holocaust drama from director Steven Spielberg, with an intense,
sweeping scope, a brave focus, and also some iconic movie-star gloss,
with Liam Neeson lit up and photographed &agrave; la Humphrey Bogart in
&quot;Casablanca&quot;. Despite this formulaic style, Neeson is very good playing
Oskar Schindler, a decadent member of the Nazi party who nevertheless
was a reluctant savior to some 1,100 Jews during WWII when he employed
them in his factory, saving them from certain death in Hitler&#39;s
concentration camps. Spielberg won a Best Director Oscar for the film,
and he gets terrific supporting performances from Ben Kingsley, Embeth
Davidtz, and most especially Ralph Fiennes as a despicable Nazi
commandant. Some of the human terror depicted is frighteningly real,
and even though the last act smacks of Hollywood grand-standing, the
movie has unlimited power. Winner of seven Oscars in all, including
Best Picture. *** from ****
