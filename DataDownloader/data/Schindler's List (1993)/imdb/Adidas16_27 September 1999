I thought this movie was although in black and white one of the best
movies
Ive seen describing the horror that took place in the Holocaust.  I
thought
it showed well how so many innocent people died and how not all Germans
were
bad and wanted to help the Jews. Well I highly recommend seeing this movie
if you like this topic even if you don't I think you will still enjoy
it.
