i had never seen a movie like that, it seem so realistic and it surly
convinced me on how cruel those years were....
My opinion is that this movie is truly a masterpiece!
i have seen several movies with this subject, some were good some weren't
but history is the same and it is unbelievable what those cruel soldiers
thought about themselves and their leader
.....................................
the film is based on a real story and that makes it special. the actors
are
great , the directed by Steven Spielberg, what do you want
more?
let's say it had it all Drama Action War and so on.....
this is my last line.... and i am finishing... the end!
