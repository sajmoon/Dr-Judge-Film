<br /><br />I dont know but I just can't call `Schindler's list' a Masterpiece.To me is
more like a   Documentary for Jews.
I can't wait to see the film `The Pianist' based on the wonderful and - more
close to reality &#150; book by the Polish Pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman(an
Holocaust surviver) , Szpilman also recounted the deplorable actions Jews
and Poles were driven to in order to survive. &quot;Szpilman was objective, not
sentimental &quot;He showed Poles who were good and those who were wicked, Jews
good and wicked, Germans good and wicked.Maybe this one will be a
Masterpiece.
