Schindler's List is by far the most powerful and profound movie going
experience I've ever had.  No other film I have seen even comes close to
the
kind of power generated by Schindler's List.  Spielberg did things with
the
medium of film that I never dreamed were possible.  Somehow he managed to
raise the artform to a transcendant, supernatural level - something that
no
other film in history (at least that I have seen) has accomplished.
Citizen
Kane may have set the standard for film, but Schindler's List completely
shattered it - breaking free of the realm of normal movie making.  Viewing
Schindler's List went far beyond a merely passive experience of viewing a
poweful film - for the first and only time I can remember, I was living
the
experience in a way that is almost inexplicable to me.  It was a truly
awesome existential and spiritual experience.  There are single scenes in
Schindler's List that are more brilliant, profound and powerful than
entire
films I have seen. There are sequences and images that haunted me for
years
afterwards and still haunt me.  To this day I get choked up and
tearie-eyed
when I recall certain scenes or images to memory.  Apart from that, the
film
is brilliantly shot with the best black and white cinematography I have
seen
since Citizen Kane.  The screenplay is remarkably subtle and the
performances are first rate all around.  Liam Neeson, who has amazing
screen
presence, was the perfect choice to play the character of Oskar
Schindler -
a man who is likeable and charasmatic, but ultimately mysterious.  And
Ralph
Fiennes was mesmerizing as the evil and complex Amon Goeth character.<br /><br />Although this film is by far the high point of all my movie going
experiences, it is also the low point in that every other film that I have
seen since (even really great ones) seems so mediocre and ordinary in
comparison.
