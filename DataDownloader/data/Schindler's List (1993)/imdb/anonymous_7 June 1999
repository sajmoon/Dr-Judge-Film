Schindler's List is undoubtedly one of Spielberg's finest films, and there
countless reasons why.  Spielberg is able to portray Oskar Schindler(Liam
Neeson) as a womanizer, shrewd businessman, and profiteer of the war in a
way that does justice to the character's complexity.  Through the use of
black and white he brings you back to the time of the Holocaust, while
using
color in the present to bridge the gap between past and present.  In
particular, the use of black and white to identify the Holocaust is
appropriate given the brutal nature of the event.  People dream in color,
but they have nightmares in black and white.  The scenes themselves help
show the facelessness of the Holocaust and the horror it brought to its
victims.  In particular, there is one scene in which a number of Jews are
forced into a shower expecting to be gassed.  The looks on their faces,
along with the moving music, makes this scene one of tremendous fright.
Although in this scene the Jews are not gassed, the message of this scene
is
there- even when Jews were not being killed, they were subject to horrors
beyond the imagination of the human mind- everyone was a victim, including
those who were not killed.  All in all, Spielberg uses the medium to his
advantage and recreates in vivid detail much of the Holocaust, while also
telling a story of how one overcomes his ignorance to help others in the
end.
