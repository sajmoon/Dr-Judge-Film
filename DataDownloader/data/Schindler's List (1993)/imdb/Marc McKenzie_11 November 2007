Simply put, this is the most powerful film I&#39;ve ever seen in my life.<br /><br />I missed it in the theater, but caught it on home video (VHS even! How
quaint!). I had heard all the buzz about it...but I wasn&#39;t prepared for
the IMPACT. At the end of the film, I was an emotional wreck, both
amazed and horrified at the extremes of human behavior.<br /><br />Yes, it is a film based on historical events. But it does not attempt
to paint its characters as pure. Liam Neeson delivers as Schindler,
while Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes--hell, the entire cast--turn in
some truly powerful performances.<br /><br />The criticism of this movie astonishes me. I cannot, for the life of
me, figure out some people in this world. Let me put it another way--if
you are not moved even a little by this film, or if you use snarky,
cynical reasons to bash it, you&#39;re not even human. You don&#39;t even have
a soul. You don&#39;t care.<br /><br />This film will resonate long after we are gone, as well as it should.
The Holocaust did happen. And yes, millions of other people besides
Jews were slaughtered. But SCHINDLER&#39;S LIST reminds us to never forget
the holocausts of history. Never forget--never again.
