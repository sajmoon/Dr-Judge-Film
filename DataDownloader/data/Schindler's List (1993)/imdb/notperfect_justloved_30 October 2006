This movie was jaw-dropping. It was so blatant and direct, it was
painful to watch, and even more painful to think about the fact that
these things really did happen.<br /><br />The black-and-white filming threw me off at first, but then I realised
that it was very effective and had an element of sophistication that I
don&#39;t believe a colour film would have had.<br /><br />However, the rating of &#39;R&#39; was very well-deserving - the violence was
shocking, for one.<br /><br />I personally think, tho, that it could have done without the sex. Thus,
I&#39;m obligated to give this movie a 9.
