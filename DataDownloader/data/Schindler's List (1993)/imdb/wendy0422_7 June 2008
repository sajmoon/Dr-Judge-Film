the director&#39;s point of view shown in the film is something more than
that of the Jews. Rather his point includes that of the Germans at the
same time by focusing mainly on the storyline of the German hero &#39;Oscar
Schindler&#39;. This whole plot clarifies his intention to make the film
hold a balanced view of two sides. Thus, It escapes from a dichotomy
which the Jewish people as the victim may easily fall into;
beautification of the Jews and demonization of the Germans.<br /><br />In this sense the director somewhat exceeds the limitation of the
nationality. In addition, his viewpoint puts an emphasis more on the
individual level than on the national one. There is actually a wide
spectrum even among German people in the film; merciless Nazi &#39;Goeth&#39;,
merciful Nazi &#39;Oscar&#39; and most people who sit back and watch
uncritically. <br /><br />It&#39;s exactly the individual traits which make the result different. In
specific &quot;Shindler&#39;s List&quot; especially focuses on the motives and acts
of such kinds of people as Oscar who gave up his profits in order to
save others. Therefore the movie is basically a further study about
those who have a great soul which rebels against the atrocities and
pursues the idea of &#39;Humanity&#39;.
