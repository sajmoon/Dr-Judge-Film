An actor usually has that perfect role when he excels only once in his/her
career, Liam Neeson portrayal of Oskar Schindler was such a role and was
the
best performance of that year.<br /><br />For Hollywood to give this award to Tom Hanks in Philadelphia for
political/sentimental reasons is nothing short of a disgrace.<br /><br />Don't you think it is funny that the film (Philadelphia) is never
mentioned
when anyone is ever talking about great movies and great performances, is
everyone embarrassed?<br /><br />It is no wonder that people don't think much of the Oscars.
