This movie was not good at all in my mind. First avole it was directed
by Steven Spielberg who usually directs amazing movies. This however I
found it very boring. It was shot in black and white and stars Liam
Neesan. I truly hate both of those things.<br /><br />This movie is about the nazi holocaust and concentraction camps. It
tell the true story of Oskar Schindler (Neesan) who is a member of the
Nazi party, however disagrees about what the Nazis are doing to the
jews. He uses his money and his power to save jew lives.<br /><br />I know it sounds good but it really isn&#x27;t. Liam Neesan cant act in my
opinion and black and white loses a lot of the effect which is ironic
because they made it black and white for the effect. I just found this
movie boring it didn&#x27;t even have any intense scenes. Skip this one
movie goers
