Spielberg&#39;s direction make Schindler&#39;s List a haunting masterpiece and
one of the greatest cinematic achievements of the 20th Century. This
isn&#39;t another of Spielberg&#39;s vibrant and imaginative adventures, this
is a real story and something of vast historical importance. A rare
story of &#39;good amongst evil&#39; during the darkest chapter of human
history. <br /><br />187 of powerful cinema with Spielberg operating at his peak. Neeson,
Kingsley and Fiennes are superb and John Williams providing a haunting
musical score.<br /><br />Winner of 7 Academy Awards (1993), including best picture, director,
screenplay and score.<br /><br />&quot;Among the list of the greatest films of all time - The Godfather,
Lawrence of Arabia, The Godfather Part II, Cuckoo&#39;s Nest... Schindler&#39;s
List&quot;<br /><br />&quot;A rare supply of cinematic mastery. Essential film-making&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No question, no doubt the best film of 1993, the best film of the 90s.

books of history... In the hall of fame. The greatest most brilliant
mind in the film industry&quot;<br /><br />-10/10-
