A little sentimentality can go along way in a film such as Schindlers
List
as your emotions are easily strung by Speilberg's choose of colliding the
inhumane realism of nazi brutality with the heroic actions of one man
that
was the savior of thousands. These extreme and true contrasts of events
magnifies the emotional anguish for which the viewer is to absorb which
was
probally Speilberg's intention. Thus creating a Superb film that effects
every person that views it in their own personal way.
