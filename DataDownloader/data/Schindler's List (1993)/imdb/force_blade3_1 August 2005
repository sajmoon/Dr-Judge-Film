&quot;It always begins in darkness until the first light illuminates a
hidden fragment of memory&quot; -The Fiftieth Gate<br /><br />A beautifully presented movie about memories of people in the darkest
hour of human history. It shows the cruelty, suffering and
discriminations the Jews suffered which only memory can tell.<br /><br />The use of black and white film technique shows it is a time of no
hope, nor happiness. It makes the film appear more authentic. The film
informs,clarify, increases understanding and creates empathy with those
that have experienced it.<br /><br />-Matt year 12
