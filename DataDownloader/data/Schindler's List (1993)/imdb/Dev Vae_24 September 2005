All aspects, even the smallest, of this movie drift the viewer further
into feeling the sorrow of the events during WWII. The music really
sinks in and the viewer tends to really think about how bad it must
have been and wonder if he or she, if put in the same position, will
act the same way or not. This movie is very accurate as well: in
depicting Schindler's personality and the names and numbers of people
saved and so forth. I think everyone should watch this movie for it
will make a person re-evaluate things they complain about and things of
that matter and those problems may seem really childish compared to
what someone can withstand without any complaint at all and with more
pain.
