I admit: an important topic.<br /><br />I admit: a pretty movie<br /><br />I admit: an expensive movie<br /><br />I admit: good acting<br /><br />But I believe this topic is too important to be handled this way. Using
standard Hollywood style: top actors, lots of stereotyping and a bit
&quot;romantic&quot; attitude - we know nothing after this movie.<br /><br />So - it's a good film. But it's unrealistic - and not at all important.
If this is the way we process the worst crime in history, then we are
not ready yet for the future.
