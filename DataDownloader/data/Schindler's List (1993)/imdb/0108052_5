The first (and last) time I viewed this masterpiece in a theater, I could
not help but notice the reaction of the audience upon their leaving. Some
were crying or trying to hold back tears, some were stunned, some had
completely blank faces, some showed signs of anger; but the overall
atmosphere was one of utter silence. Never in the history of motion
pictures
has a film had such an emotional impact upon its constituents.
