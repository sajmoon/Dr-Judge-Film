Films detailing the tragic events of the Holocaust more often than not
tend to descend into ill-advised and horrifyingly clich&eacute;d anti-war
lectures, so the notion of Steven Spielberg, debatably the founding
father of the blockbuster, helming a WW2 epic may not always have been
an ideal prospect, for fear that the gritty realism of the period may
have been lost beneath a shiny veneer of Hollywood gloss. Needless to
say, such doubts are near instantly dispelled upon viewing Schindler&#39;s
List, which, while refusing to shy away from the horrific realism of
the period, manages to extract moments of genuine glimmering hope out
of the darkness, managing to stand out as both one of the most
emotionally draining yet exhilarating and uplifting films of its kind. <br /><br />Dispelling all potential skepticism, Spielberg proves himself entirely
the right man for the job, and Schindler&#39;s List is arguably one of his
very strongest and most effective films to date. The film sears itself
into the viewer&#39;s memory, with many haunting images proving
inescapable, from the jarring sound of sporadic Nazi gunshots to the
despairing moan of thousands of Jews crowded into a ghetto. Spielberg&#39;s
effortless manipulation of the audience&#39;s emotions is laudable indeed,
as is his masterful pacing between the atrocities of war and the small
moments of comfort which prevent the film from descending into complete
darkness. Complimented by a typically moving and beautiful musical
score by John Williams, the film perfectly counterbalances despair with
hope, creating a truly compelling and moving portrait of one of
humanity&#39;s darker hours. <br /><br />The historical accuracy of the film is similarly laudable - the
immaculate period costumes and expansive set design are pitch perfect,
and all beautifully rendered in pristine black and white
cinematography, a refreshing diversion from the colour saturated
contemporary film industry. And while the film&#39;s hefty three and a
quarter hour running time may be a source of complaint, it serves only
to further immerse the audience within the context and period, allowing
the emotional drama to resonate all the more. It would seem Spielberg
was not content to simply provide audiences with a film, and instead
settles for an experience - an emotional epic with an uncanny ability
to draw an audience in, capture their sympathies and churn them out
with a tear in their eye yet a smile on their face in a nearly peerless
fashion. And despite the film&#39;s undeniable occasional forays into
melodrama and clich&eacute; (Schindler&#39;s breakdown near the end, tearfully
declaring that he could have saved more is a bit much...) it is
difficult to turn one&#39;s nose up at so captivating and heartfelt a film
as this. <br /><br />Liam Neeson gives a career defining performance as the benevolent Oskar
Schindler, and his gentle charisma and subtle intensity perfectly
compliment the many facets (womaniser, enterpriser and saviour of
thousands of innocent lives) of such a monumental role. Ben Kingsley is
similarly impressive as Itzhak Stern, the Jewish manager of Schindler&#39;s
factory. In a role which would normally entail typical Hollywood
grandstanding, Kingsley instead embraces the realism of the character
with subtly churning emotions, and his performance is all the more
masterfully crafted as consequence. However, despite the stellar work
of the main two stars, both pale in comparison with the magnetic Ralph
Fiennes, effortlessly stealing the show as impassive yet impulsively
murderous Nazi official Amon Goeth. Fiennes&#39; chilling intensity is
truly a spectacle to behold, and it is nearly worth seeing the film
just for his performance - one of the most haunting, but ultimately
human antagonistic faces ever associated with the Holocaust. Caroline
Goodall gives a strong performance as Schindler&#39;s neglected wife, and
Embeth Davidtz is genuinely moving as Helen Hirsch, a Jewish slave
working who attracts the fancy of the monstrous Goeth. <br /><br />Throughout the years, Schindler&#39;s List has been widely celebrated as
one of the most powerful, draining yet uplifting films in recent
memory, and upon viewing it, this status is difficult to contend. While
the film may toe the line of melodrama at times, and the running time
may be enough to dispel some potential viewers, the blistering
emotional clout and historical poignancy make Spielberg&#39;s labour of
love easily worth watching for anyone willing to undergo the admittably
difficult and draining watch. Out of all the second world war films out
there, Schindler&#39;s List stands out as debatably the most engrossing and
ultimately uplifting of the lot, proving that in the midst of darkness
and despair, genuine human emotion can still be celebrated. <br /><br />-10/10
