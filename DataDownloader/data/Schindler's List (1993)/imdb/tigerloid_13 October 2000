This is perhaps the greatest and agonisingly painful film of all time.  I
watched it shortly after it's release in a packed cinema and I have never
experienced such an emotionally charged atmosphere in the audience.  The
most remarkable thing was that at the end of the film everyone in the
auditorium sat in total silence until all the credits had rolled. Not one
person out of the several hundred of us there left their
seat.
