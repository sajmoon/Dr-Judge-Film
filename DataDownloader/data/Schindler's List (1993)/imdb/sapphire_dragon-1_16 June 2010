Spielberg&#x27;s so intent on telling the whole history of the Jews of
Poland after Germany&#x27;s invasion that the story gets lost, and I find
myself only watching with curiosity rather than empathy.<br /><br />The characters of Schindler and Goethe I enjoyed they&#x27;re portrayal and
think the actors did a good job but on a whole I felt like the film was
trying to tell me something rather than make me feel something.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t mean any offense to Spielberg but I&#x27;ve seen European holocaust
films that are less than half the length of this film and they are ten
times more powerful than this one. Really, Americans should leave
holocaust films to the Europeans, they know what they&#x27;re doing, I&#x27;ve
yet to come across an American holocaust film as brilliant as some of
the European ones.
