Because I cry too much for the sadness of WWII. I saw this film through my
high school history class. And I remember, I was the only one who sat down
quietly watching and crying. And I looked around, and the other kids were
either saying &quot;Pfft. Why is it in black and white?!&quot; or &quot;This is boring&quot;.
Or
laughing at parts when the natzi soldiers would point their guns at the
jews
and they lifted their hands surrendering. What was so funny? I was in
shock
on my generation's view of this disaster.<br /><br />Schinler's List is a classic movie. But I can't watch it. Otherwise, I'll
go
crazy thinking about what the jews, gypsies, and homosexuals went
through.<br /><br />10/10
