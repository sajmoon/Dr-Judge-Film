This movie was so great, it was hard to believe most of the time that
those people were actually acting. The lines are wonderfully written,
the movements are amazing, and the story adaptation is great. This was
such a sad movie, but at the same time it was so much fun to watch. I
have seen Harry Potter 4 and I could not believe that Ralph was the
same man! And all the actors seemed to understand the challenge of
playing their given roles. I LOVE this movie, and anyone who hasn&#39;t
seen it , should ASAP!<br /><br />Thank You, Ashley<br /><br />t h i s<br /><br />m o v i e<br /><br />i s<br /><br />a m a z i n g ! ! !
