I recently had a chance to see the AMC top one hundred movies, and was a
little hurt and confused that Schindler's List lost to a movie that very
few people have heard of. In my opinion, Schindler's List IS the best movie
of time. No movie has ever made me cry until that one. Steven Spielbergs
masterful direction was great, but also the stellar cast. Of all, Ben
Kingsley was most definetely the best, but great performances by Liam
Neeson and Ralph Fiennes as well. John William's score was the most
masterful, powerful, and beautiful I have ever heard. Normally most Nazi
movies tend to focus on one family surviving, and although that isn't bad,
Schindler's List is much better. It shows the Holocaust as it really was. I
hear people criticize Spielberg because he showed full nudity of both sexes,
and many acts of violence, and I say, shut up. Now that isn't to say that
this is a movie for small children. But if you feel they are ready for it I
suggest you rent it and let your teenage son or daughter watch it(with them
of course). This is truly the #1 movie. Rent it and see it.
