           I saw this film at school as part of my history GCSE. Our class
sat down to watch and were all rowdy and chatty as usual. After ten or so
minutes the room was silent. I remember when the film finished you could
hear a pin drop. The reason for this was that Spielberg left nothing to the
imagination, he showed every detail such as the one-armed man being shot
while clearing the snow, the girl in the red coat on the pile of burning
bodies, I could go on. I think that the most moving part was at the end of
the film when the actor and the actual person put a stone on Schlinders
grave, at that point, I could see that some people in the room were close to
tears. Throughly deserved 'Best Film' at the Oscars and Neeson I don't think
I've ever seen in a better role.8/10
