I don't think I can tell you how wonderful this movie is.....  but I will
try.  So here is the basic stuff.
The movie is too good to be true, the acting, the cinematography, the
directing, the story.....  but is a true story.  One that will bring you to
tears on any day.  The girl in the red dress was a tearjerker.  Where as
most movies will not show that children die too, it did.  If you haven't
seen this movie I advise you do so.<br /><br />10/10
