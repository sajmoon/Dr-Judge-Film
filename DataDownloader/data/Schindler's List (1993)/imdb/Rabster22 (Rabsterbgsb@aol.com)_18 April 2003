This film is truly riveting...if you have never seen it
before.
One can even forgive the excessive time it takes to tease out some
sort
of story. However, on subsequent viewings it quickly becomes tedious,
unlike
other films it retains no shock value, in fact it seems positively
pedestrian.
Watch it once, you will be captivated, beyond that it has
nothing.
