This movie is about ordinary people showing the best of humanity or
unfortunately the worse. As my favorite writer, PKD, said holocaust
wasn&#x27;t only Hitler and his pals but began foremost with those thousands
of anonymous Germans, Polish, Ukrainians, French that operated the
camps, the trains, opened the doors and close them, brought the lethal
gas and so on. Everyone would contribute even small in the process was
as guilty as their original planners. Shoah is about individual morals
and value and it was up to every one to choose the path to be a killer
or a righteous. The movie is brilliant for that because you see that
thousands of anonymous killers and one brave soul who repents. Sure,
it&#x27;s greed that leads Oskar to those families but it&#x27;s their suffering
that makes him change. From that point of view, i don&#x27;t think that the
girl who wore red is an error as other people think because she
symbolizes his borderline. From this moment, Oskar is touched and is on
duty: Liam becomes really irresistible of empathy and courage. Next,
some french media consider a bigger flaw that the women&#x27;s convoy is
only lead to shower and not death chambers. Well, that&#x27;s the proof that
they haven&#x27;t understood Spielberg&#x27;s sensibility: he doesn&#x27;t direct a
documentary but as always, a movie about hope, about this little flame
that still burns in the darkest hours. So he didn&#x27;t have to show those
woman dying as well as he could mix a lot of atrocities that surely
hasn&#x27;t all happened in the real Schindler&#x27;s story but happens really
during the war: killing disabled, killing for fun, etc... In that way,
Fiennes and Liam delivers unforgettable performances, the one as an
unforgettable pit of darkness and the other as a force of life. That&#x27;s
why my eyes were full of tears at the end because to see this strong
oak finally crumble was too much. <br /><br />Pairing: &#x22;Empire of the sun&#x22;: another war, another tragedy, another
hope....
