SCHINDLER&#39;S LIST, based on the book by Thomas Keneally, is the closest
thing to a perfect picture that I&#39;ve ever seen. There are others that
would qualify, but none have given me the emotional wallop that this
did back in &#39;93.<br /><br />The acting is perfect, mesmerizing in some cases, especially by Ralph
Fiennes; the score is beautiful and unforgettable; the direction is
masterful, and the use of crisp black and white color underlies the
film&#39;s realism and dark history.<br /><br />The legacy of Oskar Schindler was new to me when I first saw this, and
thanks to Spielberg, the story of one man&#39;s change of heart will be
remembered forever. SCHINDLER&#39;S LIST, to this day, is a prime example
of inspired and mesmerizing cinema.
