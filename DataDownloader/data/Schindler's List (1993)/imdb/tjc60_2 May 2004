Initially presented as capitalistic and crude, Schindler's character
gradually evolves into one of benevolence, and finally, humility. The film
is shot entirely in black and white, with the exception of one character.
A
little girl wearing a pink jacket, which we see only twice in the film. It
is that little girl, and the thought of what surely must happen to her,
that
sticks in one's mind. The two fleeting glimpses we get of this girl are
more
heart-wrenching than anything else in this film. This is not only an
historical film;it has modern relevance as well. There are monsters among
us, and poverty and ignorance are their life's blood. Overall,I give the
film a 9. It's truly hard for a film to rate a 10 with me, which is the
way
it should be.
