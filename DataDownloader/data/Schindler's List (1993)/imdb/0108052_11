Schindler's List is a long and tough movie to watch.  But it pays
dividends.<br /><br />We're all pretty familiar with the story - a German businessman enlists
Jews
to work in his factory.  At first, I believe, as an opportunist, for the
Jews are cheap, readily available labour.  He does, however, become
gradually aware that his factory means the difference between life and
death.<br /><br />And so his 'list' is born.  A list of Jews that he requires to 'work' for
him.  It is, in reality, a list of life and Schindler knows
it.<br /><br />Liam Neeson fills Schindler's boots well.  You soon forget he is Neeson at
all.  Ben Kingsley is, ofcourse, his ever-reliable brilliant self.  And
Ralph Fiennes easily creates one of the screens most hateful villians
(sadly, a villian who actually existed).<br /><br />There are some tough scenes (most notably, the liquidation of the ghetto,
Goeth's (Fiennes) brutality in the camp) and it's all filmed in beautiful
black &amp; white - except for the highlighted girl in the red dress, which has
a brilliant symbolic meaning later in the film.<br /><br />A terrible chapter in humanity's history but one told so well by Spielberg
and co.<br /><br />It has a powerful and lasting effect - just as it should.
