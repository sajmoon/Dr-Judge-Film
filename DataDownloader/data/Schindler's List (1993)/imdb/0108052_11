     This is the best war film about the Holocaust I have ever seen. It
depicts the horrors of the Holocaust and war, the tragedy of Jewish nation,
and I know, this film could be directed by a Jew, who keeps these horrible
times and crimes against humanity in his heart. The tagline says &quot;Whoever
saves one life, saves the world entire&quot;. And this film shows us that no
human life can be replaced by another one, and that there is nothing more
valuable than HUMAN LIFE. I have not seen a film of such a power in my life.
Superbly directed by Steven Spielberg, magnificently photographed in
black-and-white by Janusz Kaminski (one of the best directors of photography
in modern Hollywood, so to say), perfect performances by Liam Neeson and Ben
Kingsley, and, especially, John Williams' beautiful, brilliant score, brings
the whole horror and tragedy, cruelty of Nazism, Holocaust and War. This is
Spielberg's Triumph. Congratulations!
