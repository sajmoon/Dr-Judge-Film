This is the best made movie of the second world war so far in the meaning
that it  captures the viewers so well and draw os into the
plot.<br /><br />We truly get to see how tragic it was.Of course no one can truly explaine
how tragic and gruesome it was,but Spielberg does a dam go
job.
This is a very powerful movie that you will remember for many years to
come.<br /><br />The whole movie is told in black/white and the characters are so extremely
well played.Especially Oscar Chindler which is played by Liam Neeson.(He was
born for that role.)<br /><br />The movie last for over 3 hours,but you don't even notice the time because
the story is so touching.<br /><br />I think everybody should at least see this movie once in their
lifetime.
Maybe if everyone could see the movie,it could be a better
world.<br /><br />One of the best movies I have seen.
