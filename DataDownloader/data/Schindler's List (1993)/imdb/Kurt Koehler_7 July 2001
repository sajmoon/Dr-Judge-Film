Schindler&acute;s List is the most important film of the 90&acute;s.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg&acute;s masterpiece should be watched by every generation to
remember and to recognize the holocaust.<br /><br />It is not just a movie that tells a story, it teaches history.<br /><br />For me it is one of the best examples for humanity and courage in a time
when tyranny and barbarity reigned Europe.<br /><br />Even in Germany critics and audience were deeply moved and fascinated about
the story of a German factory owner who saved his jewish
labors.<br /><br />Our country has to thank Steven Spielberg for this film who shows that not
all Germans were nazis.
