This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly
saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.<br /><br />I have wanted to watch &#x22;Schindler&#x27;s List&#x22; for years, but could not
bring myself to do so because I don&#x27;t want to be disappointed.
&#x22;Schindler&#x27;s List&#x22; is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying
the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry
from Schindler&#x27;s List&#x22;. The scene involving mothers running after
trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene
is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but &#x22;Schindler&#x27;s
List&#x22; is a three hour film that feels too short.
