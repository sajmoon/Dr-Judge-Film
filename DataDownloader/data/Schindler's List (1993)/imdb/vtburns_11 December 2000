I have only ever seen this film once, I only ever want to see this film
once
and I will only ever need to see this film once. It is etched on my mind.
I,
like many others, left in silence.  I could not imagine inventing a
critical
analysis of this film, picking small points of detail or of style, or even
scoring points off the Director. It stands alone as a monumental piece of
cinema, a magnificent accomplishment.
