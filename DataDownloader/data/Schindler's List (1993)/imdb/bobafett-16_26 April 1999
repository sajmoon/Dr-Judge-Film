This is a work of art. Not only that it proves that Spielberg is a great
director. I first saw this movie when it came out. I was twelve and even
then I was impressed. This also managed to bring out some of the greatest
acting I have seen. Liam Neeson was perfect for the role. He brought
strength that no other actor could. Ralph Fiennes was at least equal if not
better. He created one of the greatest villains in history. Yet he brought
the human touch to the role. It was the saddest movie that I have ever seen
and the most important. Spielberg has created a masterpiece that will be
remembered for many years.
