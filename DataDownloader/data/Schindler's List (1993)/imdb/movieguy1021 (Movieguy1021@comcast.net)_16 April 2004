Eventually, I would have had to have seen Schindler's List. Not only was it
a staple in modern filmmaking, but I'm also Jewish and have been taught all
about the Holocaust. I like Spielberg, and I can sit through long movies
(although I did watch the movie in three pieces), so I plunked this newly
released DVD into my player and was treated to an adventure, the likes of
which I had never seen before.<br /><br />Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a German during World War II. All he cares
about is money, and runs a business while the height of the Nazi regime in
Poland is taking place. He realizes that he can save money on hiring Jews
instead of Poles to work in his factory (since the Jews would be taken from
the concentration camps, they would not really require much, if any, pay).
After some pleading from his wife and his desire to hold onto his
accountant, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kinglsey), Schindler decides to make a list of
Jews to save from certain death to work in his factory.<br /><br />Quite obviously, this movie will have different effects on different people,
much like the recent Passion of the Christ did. Those who had relatives who
were captured by the Nazis, or knew someone, or were alive at the time, or
anything of the like, would be much more affected by this film than others.
I found myself horrified by many of the atrocities brutally shown,
especially ones done by Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes). It's amazing, how you
can be so affected by gruesomeness done to characters you know nothing
about.<br /><br />On a lesser side, I found many scenes to be unnecessary and uninteresting.
They only added to the already obscenely long runtime. Also, the character
of Goeth, when not brutalizing Jews, seemed to become perfectly normal and
balanced. Goeth seemed duplicitous, and therefore somewhat unbelievable.
Neeson was good, but Kingsley was excellent. One more thing that bothered me
was the girl in the red dress. Filmed in almost all black-and-white, there's
some sort of symbolism there, but there's no telling what it
is.<br /><br />Overall, Schindler's List is an important film, and a tough one to get
through, but what you'll get out of it will differ from what others
will.<br /><br />My rating: 8/10<br /><br />Rated R for war violence and language.
