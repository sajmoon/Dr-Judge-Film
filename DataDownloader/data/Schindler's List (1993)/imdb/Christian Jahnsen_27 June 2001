This movie is the most touching story I've ever seen. Usually, the
tear-quenchers of today never provoke any stronger emotions within me, but
Schindler's List, which I've seen about ten times by now, has me crying
every single time, and we're talking AFTER the film ends. The fact that a
person like Oskar Schindler existed is simply fantastic. 1200 people lived
through the WW2, purely because of this one man, who could have opted to
live like a king for the rest of his life, but chose to throw all his
riches
away to save the lives of people, he hardly knew.<br /><br />It's a HARD movie, that will repel you and make you sick to your stomach.
But it's a must see! Please don't miss it!<br /><br />And Steven Spielberg ... thank you! You're the man. Oh well, Kubrick will
always be the man, but you come close!
