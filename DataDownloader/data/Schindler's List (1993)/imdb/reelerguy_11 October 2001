Schindler's List is a must-see. It is depressing, yet uplifting. It has
powerful scene after powerful scene. Schindler's character is done
perfectly. The holocaust is portrayed in a way that is almost
documentorial.
I do not like most of Spielberg's movies. In fact, I think he has made some
very terrible movies (Jaws comes to mind). But Schindler's List is a
masterpiece. If only Spielberg would stick to films like this one.
10/10.
