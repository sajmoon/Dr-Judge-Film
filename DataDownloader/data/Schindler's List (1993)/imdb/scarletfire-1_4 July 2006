I found this movie to be very boring. Not sure what people could
possibly see in it. I went with some friends who wanted to see it the
1st day it was released in the theaters. The whole first hour was just
about this guy setting up a pots and pans factory. I was ready to just
walk out at that point, but my friends wanted to stay so I was stuck
there watching the rest of this.<br /><br />I&#39;ve seen many documentaries on A&amp;E, History Channel, etc on the
holocaust and I guess I just presumed that everyone else had too.
Apparently a lot of people never have, never read about it in school or
anything either. After it was over, these people in the theater were
all sitting there like they were stunned or something. Like they just
had no idea that stuff like that happened during WWII. I was thinking
to myself &quot;lets just get the heck out of here&quot;.<br /><br />If you never get drawn into a movie at the beginning, it can sometimes
be too late - no matter if it gets better later on you can just lose
any interest in it.
