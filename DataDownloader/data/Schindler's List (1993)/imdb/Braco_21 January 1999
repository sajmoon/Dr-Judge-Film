&quot;Schindler's List&quot; is one of the absolutely greatest movies ever made. I've
seen it so many times now (I believe it is five or six), and it still has
such an amazing impact on me. The closing scene of the film is so
heartbreaking that I (like another user on this list) cried every time I saw
it. This is an amazing classic.
