The full horror of the concentration camps is something that is hard for us
to understand.  What is most shocking is that all this happened in recent
history, in the memories of people who are alive today.
When studying the events of World War Two and the Holocaust, the amount of
people murdered by the Nazis, and the persecution they suffered, is
something we can never have a real concept of.
However, Steven Spielberg. director of most of the the biggest blockbusters
in the world, thought he would try to attempt to help us see for ourselves. 
He attempted to make a film that showed the reality of what happened in
Poland during the Holocaust, letting people of our generation never forget
the full extent of what happened.
It is hard to review this film, as it's aim is not merely to
entertain.
But it is a film every single person should see.
