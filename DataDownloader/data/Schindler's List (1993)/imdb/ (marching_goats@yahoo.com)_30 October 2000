I found this a very profound movie and never once said, &quot;well thats fake.&quot;
Or &quot;The nazis are so evil and fake.&quot; I was not even old enough to be in the
Vietnam war and find this a very moving movie. It pisses me off when you
people say this is so stupid or fake! Say that to the people who survived
this. This movie was made so we never forget what happened. This is a
moving, talking, living memorial and I can never imagine what those people
went through.
