I didn&#39;t see this movie till recent. But I&#39;ve been told it&#39;s violent
and very well received back in 1993. I&#39;m 17 so it was OK for me to see
a movie like this.<br /><br />Anyways Schindler&#39;s List takes place during WW2. And those who attended
history class would know that Adolf Hitler had total control in most
parts of Europe and banned all Jewish activity and removed all the
Jewish from their homelands. It was the grimmer moment in the entire
Jewish history.<br /><br />A man named Oscar Schindler was a business man and a Nazi. Only he was
different from other Nazis. He provides the Jews work at his company
only if they have working experience. Schindler in secretly does not
kill or torture any Jews. He finds the whole thing wrong in a way. But
he doesn&#39;t adment it because he&#39;s might receive serious consciences if
he were to say he likes Jews.<br /><br />He makes sure his Jews aren&#39;t killed or sent to the more lethal
concentration camps by making a list of hundreds of Jews that he bought
with his own money. With that list he could be able to grant their
freedom by the time the war is over.<br /><br />This movie is very well made. Spielberg did a great job in recreating
this time period. I can see why it was given an Oscar during the 1993
Accadmy Awards. It&#39;s also interesting that 3/4s of the movie is shot in
Black and White.<br /><br />It&#39;s strongly recommended for any Spielberg collection. Just know this
movie isn&#39;t for everyone. It has swearing, violence, and some strong
nudity. It&#39;s not for kids so I&#39;d recommend it for ages 16 and up or at
least someone mature enough to see a violent movie.<br /><br />It might offend certain Jews or those who are offended by Nazis as
well.
