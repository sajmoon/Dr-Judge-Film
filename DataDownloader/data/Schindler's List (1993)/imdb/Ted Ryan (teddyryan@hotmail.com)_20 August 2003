Steven really went to bat for this one.  An amazing film.  Top of the lot
performances in and out.  Ralph Fiennes was brilliant.  Wish the ending,
though, wasn't as sentimental; because what made the picture such as classic
for the majority was the fact that it treated the events with such
indifference. <br /><br />  Ted's Grade: A
