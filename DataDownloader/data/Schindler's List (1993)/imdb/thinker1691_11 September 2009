Too often the history of the Second World War concentrates on the
massive destruction between the countries involved. It is true nearly
25 million people were killed, but the most horrendous tally in human
cost was suffered by a single race and they were European Jews. Anyone
who Denys this is not only a fool, but a historical moron as well.
There is so much irrefutable evidence to disprove them it&#x27;s simply
ludicrous to try. In this film &#x22; Schinder&#x27;s List &#x22;, director Steven
Spielberg lays it out cinematically for all to see. The film has so
many notable qualities, it&#x27;s difficult to say which illuminated it the
most. The story is based on the real life of humanitarian Oscar
Schindler (Liam Neeson) who began the war as a Nazi sympathizer and
profiter, but soon realized his Nazi friends were murdering millions,
on behalf of the most damnable doctrine ever created. Itzhak Stern (Ben
Kingsley) plays the courageous bookkeeper who not only kept
Schindeler&#x27;s files, but helped him to save the lives of thousands. The
heavy, Amon Goeth is played despicably evil by Ralph Fiennes. It is
very interesting that during the war, ten of thousands were proud to be
Nazi soldiers and SS men, yet after the war, you couldn&#x27;t find two who
would own up to their murderous atrocities. Still the movie has
garnered so much acclaim and honor, it has become a tribute to
Spielberg and his effort to remember the Hollocaust and the saddest
chapter in human history. With no effort at all this has become a
Classic in every sense of the word. *****
