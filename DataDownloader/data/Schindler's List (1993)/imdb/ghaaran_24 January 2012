The problem is that people in the US have lowered their standards and
are accepting more and more mediocre crap instead of insisting upon
quality. Surprisingly many American people claim &#x22;The 300&#x22; as their
favorite movie. They believe it&#x27;s based on a true story! No wonder
Schindler&#x27;s List didn&#x27;t make an attempt to ward itself off from the
wire of sh!t out there in Hollywood. I think Hollywood is completely
out of new and original ideas. Plus the quality of actors has gone down
a lot... In addition to this, I think they try to rely too much on
special effects and theme music to push a movie nowadays. The plots are
thin and don&#x27;t make any sense at all, the actors have no feeling,
there&#x27;s no character development and everything is pretty much clich&#xE9;&#x27;
or just a patchwork/ remake of other movies (like the Matrix, Blade,
Star Wars, etc...) They don&#x27;t know how to balance special effects and
acting anymore. <br /><br />0/10
