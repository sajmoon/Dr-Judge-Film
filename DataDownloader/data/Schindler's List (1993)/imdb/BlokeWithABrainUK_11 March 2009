I am not going into detail here - as all that needs to be said has been
said...<br /><br />But viewing of this film should be compulsory for all. It is to
Spielberg&#39;s eternal credit that he was able to tackle the hardest of
all subjects and humanise the most appalling period in recent history.<br /><br />The scrip, characterisations, direction, performances and editing are
all beyond criticism and after three hours I would defy anyone to
remain indifferent to the central message - that in the darkest of
hours humanity can overcome evil, and the actions of one person make
the most profound difference to many.<br /><br />Beyond entertainment and beyond compare.
