I had not seen Schindler's List in it's entirety for a few years.  The
last
time that I viewed it I was a lot younger and couldn't really digest it's
complexities to the full.<br /><br />Of course I was able to appreciate the excellence of it's aethestics and
formalities, but it was the great depth to the characters that confused
me:
when you are younger you view the world in as black and white a vision as
this film itself, as everyone knows.<br /><br />I was mesmerised by the performances of Liam &quot;I'm Retired&quot; Neeson and
Ralph
Fienes.<br /><br />Even Neeson's occasionally shaky accent can't hinder the fact that in his
character he has realised the ambiguity and hinted capitalist, turned ever
so slowly into a humanist by what should have been apparent to him all
along
- namely the unmotivated slaughter of his workforce.  His motivations
change
ever so convincingly from money to conscience and by the end of the
picture
the most moving moment belongs to him and not to the survivors of the
terror.<br /><br />Fienes is such a complex character it's untrue.  Spielberg has shot the
pair
throughout the film as equals-and-not-quite oposites.  They are frequently
intercut going through the same actions and mostly in the same space on
screen) shot with an equally spaced two-shot.  This brotherhood means that
Fienes is hard(er) to detest than you might think.  At times he appears to
take on board Schindler's advice and passificity.  He doesn't really hate
the Jewish people eiether - he's a massacist, a lover of violence and a
generally nasty bloke who just needs an excuse to abuse and kill.  At one
point we see him distressed at a gun misfiring again and again - it is not
the gun not working, but the fact that his resolve to kill is failing
after
the first click of the trigger that is distressing him, i feel.  At heart
he
is a vulnerable coward.<br /><br />The various acts of violence are perfectly integrated into the flow of the
picture and therefore as unexpected and unmotivated as their real-life
counterparts, unlike Polanski's 'Pianist' in which they were insulting
setpieces.<br /><br />Spielberg's film has a much greater feel of authenticity than Polanski's
and
is much more powerful.  It is full of touches in which you can relate to
and
understand, moments the summarise the best (and worst) in human nature,
whereas the Pianist will feel like just one big cliche of the holocaust,
after viewing 'SL'.<br /><br />This really is a powerful film, its just a pity that nobody seems to have
learned from what it is based on.<br /><br />8/10
