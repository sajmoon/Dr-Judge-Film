I was not as impressed with this film as most.  Though the acting was quite
good, this movie was merely a rehash of many that have dealt with this
difficult subject.  When the girl in the red dress (the only color in the
film) makes her appearance, I felt like I was being hit with a Spielberg
baseball bat that said, &quot;Here comes the message...pay attention now.&quot;  Not
very subtle at all (typical Spielberg).
