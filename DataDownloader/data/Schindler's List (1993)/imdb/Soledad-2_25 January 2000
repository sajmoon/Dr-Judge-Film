After watching this movie I feel deeply compelled to recommend it to
everyone.  It's simply perfect and nothing else.  I feel extremely grateful
to Steven Spielberg for creating such a wonderful movie, a true masterpiece.
 Schindler's List deserves to be on top of all the 1999 movies.  It's a
tribute to the victims of the Holocaust and it's also a tribute to the
generosity of the human heart.  Don't wait any longer.  Rent it now.
