When I first saw this movie, I was only a 8 years old boy I knew i was
something special but I didn't quite understand it since I was only a
kid.Later I saw the movie and i realized that Schindler's List was true
masterpiece.<br /><br />The movie is touching and beautiful, the direction is fantastic (Steven
Spielberg is movie wizard) the acting is great.I specially admire Ralph
Fiennes role.Ben Kingsley also very good.<br /><br />Many people don't like black and white pictures and I'm not a big fan
either but it gives a sense of realism impossible to capture in color
movies.This is of course a movie that will survive the test of time and
shows in very realistic what the Holocaust was.<br /><br />Spielberg has surprised us with movies like Saving Private Ryan and
Jurassic Park, but I think he will never make a movie so brilliant as
this one.<br /><br />*****/*****
