Oh my God...
The commandant really scared the crap outta me.. especially the scene when
he is hitting Helen Hirsh, or when he talks to his reflection in the
mirror
and says &quot;I pardon You&quot;.. But I do at the same time find him very
attractive.. But I've read that the real Amon Goeth was a ladies man so
they
had to get someone attractive I guess.. and they sure did..
The film itself is fantastic.. Great acting, great music and really scary
scenes...<br /><br />BUT!!! When Amon calls Helen when he wants to say thank you to her in the
scene with Schinlder, Amon and Helen, he says Lena not
Helen...
