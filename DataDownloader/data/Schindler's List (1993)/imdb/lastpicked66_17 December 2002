Oh man, how funny is this movie? man oh man, what a horrible film
featuring
far too many shylocks and crying women. There was, however, some great
bits,
like the girl in the red dress, and when they turned over the bed and all
the jews were hiding under it. Speilberg finally trumped &quot;the diary of
anne
frank&quot; in the feild of comedy dealing with WWII. For pure seriousness
regarding this period of time, see speilberg's 1941.
