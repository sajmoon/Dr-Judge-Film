Those words, mean everything. This film, is Spielberg at the top of his
game. I remember seeing it, and was completely floored. I have never
cried at a movie, but I came close with this one. I don't think it is
close to a war doc. But more of just one of the truest movies ever
made. They didn't edit out death, they let people know, this is what
happened, this is mankind at it's worst. The directing, the acting, the
cinematography, the music, and everything puts this film at the top.
It's hard to think it was made in 1993, because AFI's top 100 movies,
put this at 9. Now important movies, are the ones who broke barriers,
and ones other films follow. This was made in the 90's, and it is still
that important. Steven Spielberg showed everyone, (including the
Oscars) why he is one of the greatest directors of all time. I watch
this movie a lot, but not just for the story. If you watch this movie
from a different aspect (writing, directing, acting, etc.) every time,
you wont get bored. Because each aspect can blow you away. Definitely
one of the greatest films EVER made.
