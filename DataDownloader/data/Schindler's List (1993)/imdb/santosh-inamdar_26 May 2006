Schindler&#39;s List , without a doubt, is one of the greatest movies ever
produced. Screenplay, direction and performances are at their best.
Story and the message it delivers to world makes this movie a Must
watch. I mean a compulsory watch.<br /><br />The message is very clear Humanity exist in every one. It is all about
discovering it. The power of humanism is the greatest and noblest force
in the world. That is what Steven Spielberg has captured in this movie.
This movie is very significant because of its relevancy even in today&#39;s
world. <br /><br />Steven Spielberg has proved from this movie that he has the greatest
cinematic mind. Disguised awakening in Oskar Schindler&#39;s character
could have been the most difficult part to picturize in this movie.
Hats off to Mr. Spielberg. <br /><br />Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsly provide the acting pillars to this movie.
Fine history details and art direction are amazing. <br /><br />Finally &#133; Thanks Steven Spielberg, for having given this movie to us &#133;
