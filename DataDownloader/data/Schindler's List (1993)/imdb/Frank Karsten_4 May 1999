One doesn't notice the long duration of the film. It doesn't bore you.
Very
unfortunately, in the end Spielberg shows his Hollywood background by
becoming overly sentimental again. Schindler starts crying and regrets he
didn't save more jews.
Fienes is wonderfully frightening as the sadistic Nazi.
At the start I thought I wouldn't be able to accept the english speaking
polaks, germans and russians (there are other languages besides english,
you
know) but after a while it doesn't annoy anymore.
I wonder whether the sex scenes have been removed for the US
version.
