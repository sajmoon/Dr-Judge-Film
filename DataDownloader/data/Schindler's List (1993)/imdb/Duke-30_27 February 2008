Just a few comments: Anyone saying here that Spielberg knows only Big
Budget spectacular filming, obviously isn&#39;t aware of his Empire of the
Sun or Color Purple. Both of these works go hand in hand with
Schindler&#39;s list.<br /><br />Anyone saying last scene (the ring) is fiction - I don&#39;t care - the
scene is an emotional tsunami. The Schindler Jews stated in their
interviews they don&#39;t care who he was or how he led his life - to them,
he is an angel. I think the same. The man is a rare angel. <br /><br />Also, the cinematography and the 40&#39;s heavy feel was never seen or
surpassed before (or after), not even with Spielberg&#39;s Ryan.
