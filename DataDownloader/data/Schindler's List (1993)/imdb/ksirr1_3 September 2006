This film was truly moving.I recommend this film to anybody who enjoys
a great war film. Set in World War Two, this movie is an exceptional
display of the true nature of war. Although there are gory bits it is a
very true account. Another good thing about this film is that it is a
true story based on a real person Oskar Schindler who i believe was a
war-time hero. To be able to rebel against such a man as Adolf Hitler
would take a lot of strength. The scenery in the movie is very fitting
to the story and is a large part of the movie. Anyone who doesn&#39;t have
a weak stomach should see this film. It has a great storyline which
will captivate you until the very end. Without giving anything away,
this was an excellent film, one of the best ever made! Therefore, I
give it a rating of 10/10 :)
