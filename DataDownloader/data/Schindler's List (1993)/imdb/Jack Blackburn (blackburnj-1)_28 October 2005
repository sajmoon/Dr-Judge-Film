Steven Spielberg's career was somewhat unfilled before 1993. Sure there
were some fine films and some enjoyable films but there wasn't the
truly great film that such a great filmmaker deserved. In 1993, that
drought was ended by Schindler's List.<br /><br />When Poland is subdued by the invading Nazi armies, Oskar Schindler
attempts to form a business, employing only Jews and freeing them from
the Ghetto. However, the Holocaust and the Final Solution begin to take
hold; more and more of his workers are taken to concentration camps but
Schindler continues to try and get Jews into his factories. However, as
the year begins to draw to a close, Schindler begins to draw up a list
of Jews who he wants to buy and take to his own factory.<br /><br />What a film! It is fantastic. It is supremely well made, exquisitely
written with a touching score and brilliantly shot. It is a
tour-de-force with three fantastic central performances from Liam
Neeson as the benevolent and great Schindler, Ben Kingsley as the
mistreated Jew, Itzhak Stern and Ralph Fiennes as the homicidal and
psychotic Goeth. It is simply sublime from all.<br /><br />John Williams' score is possibly his best ever (which is high praise
indeed). The photography is superb from Janusz Kaminski and they all
help to make a film that has two strong bases. The first is Steven
Zaillian's fantastic script, brilliant created and moulded. The second
is Spielberg's direction, which is genial, brilliant and sublime. He
deals with the case of the Holocaust in a suitably stark way but he
also provides an uplifting film that shows humanity's better side in
one man at the very least. He also uses his skill to the maximum. In
particular, his use of colour is awesome, especially his focusing on a
girl in a red coat during the liquidation of the ghetto and her
re-appearance later in the film Put simply, this is a film that is
veritably great.<br /><br />Without a doubt, the film is one of the greatest ever and should be
seen by all.
