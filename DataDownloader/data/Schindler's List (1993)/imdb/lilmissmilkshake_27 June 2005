'Schindler's List' is a true account of how Oskar Schindler, a Czech
factory owner, saved over 1,100 Jews during the Holocaust. The film is
based around his story, but also includes other occurrences such as
ones relating to Amon Girth, concentration camps, extermination camps,
gas chambers, ghettos, the War etc. As a student, watching this film
helped me to gain more of an understanding of the Holocaust and what
happened during that horrible time. It captured a side of the story in
a more real way than out of a textbook, it showed me the human side,
the emotions and fear that can't be described in words. In a surprising
way, I enjoyed watching the film, even though it upset me at points.
The Holocaust is an event that no human should ever avoid, and as
horrifying as it is, I don't regret watching this real-life tale. I
think people could call 'Schindler's List' many things, but no one
could ever call it boring. I found it really interesting, and I think
it's a film everyone should see and learn from.
