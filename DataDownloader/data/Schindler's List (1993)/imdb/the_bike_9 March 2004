 Spielberg is now the Numero Uno director of schmaltzy cinema. I thought
Saving Private Ryan was the ultimate good guys save the poor soul, but this
one outdoes Ryan in every conceivable heart-tugging,
noble humanity fashion. Don't view this film as accurate history, if<br /><br />Private Ryan is any guide. Historical accuracy is not a
Spielberg
characteristic. It's the heartstrings he keeps tugging. I next expect a new
Pollyanna by Spielberg any day now. The problem with Spielberg's
characterizations is that people are either black or white, no inbetweens
are allowed. But even  old Adolph can be presented in a way that makes him
the human being that he was, regardless. This is what makes Shakespeare such
a genius in his plays - he never failed to see all sides of a personality.
Spielberg's characterizations are cartoons.
This could have been a really good movie, if it had acknowledged the<br /><br />humanity in every person and been realistic.
