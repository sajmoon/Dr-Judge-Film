I know that the IMDb rating is 8.8, that this film won academy award
for best picture (which means very little), that it was one of the
earliest features to take an in depth, insider look at the Holocaust,
that this film is nearly critic-proof because of its sensitive subject
matter, but, if you take a look at who directed it and how the film
comes across, wouldn&#39;t a person feel just a little offended? <br /><br />1. Steven Spielberg made no attempt at separating his &quot;serious&quot;, &quot;grown
up&quot; film from this &quot;entertainments.&quot; The Nazis in &#39;Schindler&#39;s List&#39;
are like the Nazis in the Indiana Jones movies <br /><br />2. For such a harrowing subject, he uses some fantastic showmanship.
The cinematography is a wonder, a joy to look at. There&#39;s even a
tantalizing nipple shot, seriously, in a movie that&#39;s supposed to
seriously look at the Holocaust? <br /><br />3. The cruel joke/ thriller element to the old man who is nearly
executed but is saved by the sheer chance that a gun jams twice! The
scene had the same potential to keep an audience on its seat as say, an
actual thriller!<br /><br />4. The overly simplistic view of the Nazis as completely evil. This one
I can understand. I wouldn&#39;t expect any Jewish person to even attempt
to see Nazis as nothing more than aberrations of humanity.<br /><br />5. An incredibly manipulative collection of closing scenes; first the
&quot;I could have done more&quot; speech that Schindler gives as he&#39;s inundated
by those he saved is tailor made for emotional assault, as he&#39;s praised
like a strangely Christ-like figure.<br /><br />6. Final shot of the actual Schindler Jews paying tribute to his grave.
What about the other six million? <br /><br />7. And finally, the worst of the worst - the girl in the red coat. In
order to fully grasp that the Holocaust is bad, really bad - because
otherwise Jews and gentile alike would not be able to grasp this - he
displays a girl in a washed out red coat and then shows her red coat on
a cart of dead bodies. If that isn&#39;t cheap, exploitation, then honestly
tell me what is.<br /><br />In the end the movie is typically well made - excellent cinematography,
seamless editing, strong acting, entertainingly fast paced - in other
words a Hollywood movie. Should that be the definitive way to represent
the Hollocaust?
