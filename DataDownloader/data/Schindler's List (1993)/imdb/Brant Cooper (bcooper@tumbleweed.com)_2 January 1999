Spielberg cannot control his urge to add childish simplicity into otherwise
sophisticated material:  the red coat is a symbolic sledgehammer worthy of
Oliver Stone, and Liam Neeson ends the movie by launching into an overacted,
overwrought, melodramatic &quot;we're not worthy, we're not worthy.&quot;
Ugh.
