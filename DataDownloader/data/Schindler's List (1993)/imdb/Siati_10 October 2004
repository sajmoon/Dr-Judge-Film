Schindlers List is one of those movies that you just have to see at
least once.It is very powerful and important in it's message and story.
Even though I actually slightly prefer The Pianist more now,this movie
is still the one which introduces the horrors of the holocaust to most
children and teenagers because it is shown in schools,probably around
the world.So they would learn what happened and maybe be interested in
seeing some documentaries about the subject later.<br /><br />So like I said in my summary it is a modern classic.And a very
important one as well.The movie captures the atmosphere of the time and
place excellently and the black and white cinematography only makes it
more powerful...and beautiful.<br /><br />The actors are of course excellent.This is Liam Neeson's most
significant role and the one he will forever be remembered by.Another
breathtaking performance is,of course the charming but incredibly cruel
Amon Goeth,played so well by Ralph Fiennes.He is so good in this role
that you just start to think of him as the embodiment of evil in man.A
truly chilling performance,the best of the film IMO even though others
are very good as well.<br /><br />So I think I've said the necessary things.Schindlers List : If you
haven't seen it already then don't wait anymore!!It is Spielberg's best
film by far,so emotional and beautiful. 9 out of 10
