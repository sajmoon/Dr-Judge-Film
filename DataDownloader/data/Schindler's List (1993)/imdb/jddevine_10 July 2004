What a story! Somewhere in the definition of &quot;life-affirming,&quot; the
title of this movie should appear. I had to &quot;persuade&quot; my wife to go
see it with me (again) because she thought it would be depressing. It
is not, and she loved it.<br /><br />I thought the characters were fascinating, and the acting was fabulous.
The emotion on scree is electric; it's clear these folks were inspired. <br /><br />Haunting images too. The one that gets me the most is the motion the
child makes as the train goes by. Everything that is wrong with the
world, right there in one image.<br /><br />Just the music of the film is enough to make me tear up. If you don't
like instrumental music, you might after this film.<br /><br />This film sucks me in every time I see it. It goes by so fast; it
always seems to last about 15 minutes.<br /><br />The last scene of the movie has to be one of the top film endings of
all time. It floored me.<br /><br />Thanks to all who helped make it.
