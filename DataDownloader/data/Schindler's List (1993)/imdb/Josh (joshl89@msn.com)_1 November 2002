I didn't expect much before I saw this film, but when I did, I was blown
away by what I saw. Everything about this film was excellent. Based on the
book Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally, this film succeeds in every area.
The performances by the lead actors which include Liam Neeson, Ben
Kingsley
and Ralph Fiennes are top notch and as ever the directing by Steven
Spielberg is wonderful. This has to be one of the best films Spielbreg has
directed (and he has directed quite a few decent ones).
What I thought worked very well on this film was using black and white.
When Neeson's character was watching the little girl in the red dress
(which
was in colour), you could really tell that that was what he was focusing
on.
Now I'm not one who normally breaks down when watching a movie but I was
close when watching this. The horror and cruelty that those Jews had to
undertake was unbelievable.
I have to say Spielberg is a genius when it comes to directing films.
Before this film in the very same year he released Jurassic Park, another
brilliant film and all the rewards he took home in 1993 he
deserved.
