This is one of those films I am glad I watched, but doubt very much if
I could ever watch it again. Not because it is a bad film, quite the
opposite is true, it is a very well made film with top notch acting,
directing, everything. But it&#39;s content is so disturbing and some of
hte violence so graphic that I couldn&#39;t sit through it again. There
type of films show the true horror of war rather than the romatasized
or comic book approach that leads successive generations of young men
to think that war is a glamorous career, when in fact wars are full of
evil and horror as this film so aptly depicts. And at last Steven
Spielburg got an Oscar, something he should have had many times before
since he has produced some of the best films ever in my opinion.
