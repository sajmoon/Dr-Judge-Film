Not only is this masterpiece the greatest  film ever made, it can be
considered one of mankind's greatest artistic achievements, to be compared
with the best of Mozart, Shakespeare and Michelangelo.  Using the subtle
but startling shadings only black and white cinema can produce Steven
Speilberg has created a protean achievement both thought-provoking and
shattering in content and scope.  Ralph Fiennes portrayal of the
concentration camp commandant  shows the horrifying side of a human both
sad and twisted.  Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give performances equally
compelling.  John Williams musical score is flawless, evoking an emotional
response without overcoming this disturbing story about a German
industrialist who slowly learns about the Holocaust and tries to save the
few Jews  he can from certain death. This miraculous piece of cinema should
be required viewing for anyone interested in the human condition and the
depths and height  to which we all can reach.
