Steven Speilberg's Masterpiece is a real eye opener into human evil, and
the
triumph of the human sprit. An accurate account of the inhumanity of
people
who would rather blame and condemn those who are of different religious
background, and to condone their hatred with unspeakable acts of violence
and cruelty.  I glad that this film is finally coming to DVD, because it
time to reeducate the public of the most horrifying time in human history.
Especially now when people really needed to see it to know the danger of
misconception and the horror of misleading propaganda where power does
corrupt, even when it involves religion.<br /><br />This is a perfect time for this movie to come out.
