Schindler's List in my opinion one of the best films ever made
-
furthermore, it's a monument for all of those who did have
to courage to do something good, however small.<br /><br />Oskar Schindler was no stereotypical hero, on the contrary,
he had many faults which were wonderfully portrayed in
the
film.<br /><br />Strangely, the film - however serious it was - was entertaining,
too, which is rather remarkable:<br /><br />There seems to be a general belief in most of &quot;serious&quot;
critics
(and filmmakers) that a good, serious film with a difficult
theme has to be unsuccessful - take a look at some film
which
critics did like, and you'll find a lot of commercial,
unsuccessful, boring films, for example Fassbender's films.<br /><br />If you take a closer look at the criticism uttered by some
of &quot;serious&quot; critics, you'll note that they stick to the
credo
above - a &quot;good&quot; movie must not be a successful movie.<br /><br />I've watched the movie 1994 and I'm not sure if I'm going
to
watch it again - it is till the present day the most moving,
stirring movie I've seen - and the first (and only) only
in which I've actually cried.<br /><br />So, I've you're going to watch Schindler's List (which
I
strongly recommend), do yourself a favor: don't plan 
anything entertaining till the next day - I wasn't able
to
do so after watching it.<br /><br />10 Points out of 10.<br /><br />Mark
