If you haven&#x27;t watched it yet, you better get it! I watched the uncut
version. It is a very sad movie, but uplifting at the same time. Who
cares about special affects, and all the really extreme graphics movies
have now days. This movie doesn&#x27;t even have any of that except for the
one red colored item in the whole entire movie. It is everything a
movie should be. I recommend this movie to watch, but it is not for the
faint of heart. The horror it reveals of the actual holocaust is
something the faint of heart would most certainly be torn from. It&#x27;s
true. This is what happened. And this is a movie that truly reveals it
exactly how it went.
