OK, first the good. <br /><br />The acting is excellent. So is the casting. The movie-making is good.
The choice of stories was phenomenal. The last scene (the one in color)
was exceptionally powerful, deserving to be on the greatest scenes list
of all time. <br /><br />Now for the bad. <br /><br />Schindler&#39;s List is a holocaust movie made without a fundamental
understanding of the Holocaust. Yes, they get the bare bones facts
right enough, but the movie is two dimensional at best. Everyone in the
movie fits into a different category, with very little variation in
characters within a given category. Either they are Jewish or they are
non Jewish, and if they are non Jewish, they are either evil anti
Semites or reformed heroes. If they are Jewish, they all act the same.
Their reaction is uniformly &quot;if only I could do something, I would, but
I can&#39;t, so the only thing left is to live and die honorably, which
means being silent when things happen.&quot; There is one Jew who can do
something, but other than that, they are all like cardboard cutouts.
For me, the impact of a movie comes from seeing people react to
different situations, even painful ones, but from seeing REALISTIC and
THREE DIMENSIONAL people reacting to situations. Schindler&#39;s List
totally lacked that, so, to me, even though the movie is about
something I am very interested in, the movie was exceptionally dull and
uninteresting. It was not powerful at all. In addition, the historical
accuracy was marginal.
