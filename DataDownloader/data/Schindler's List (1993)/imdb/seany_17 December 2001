I took my Mother to see this movie precisely because I thought it would be
one of those 'special' movies. I have lived in the USA for several years
now
and only visit England 2-3 times a year and I like to take my Mother to the
movies when I go home as she does not get to go very often.<br /><br />I had no idea how moving a movie could be. I have been told that this movie
is not as moving as the 'real footage' of what actually happened but how
could it ever be? Especially if your family was involved in this nightmare.<br /><br />However, for me this movie was the most moving I have ever seen. I have
never walked out of a cinema and attempted to say something but could not
because my words were choked back by the emotion in me. In deed, there were
many times that the tears were flowing and not because of cheap cinematic
tricks but because the way this story was presented was so effective that I
could not help myself become immersed in the realism of the horror that
un-folded but at the same time showing that there can be humanity even in
those we least expect.<br /><br />In two words - Amazing and Humbling, easily my number one film, even though
it is difficult to experience, anyone remotely interested in film HAS to
see
this.<br /><br />
