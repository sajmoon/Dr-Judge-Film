Schindler's List is without a doubt the greatest movie ever made in the 90's
and for me is among the top 5 greatest movies ever. I believed every second
of this masterpiece. Great performances by Liam Neason, Ben Kingsly and
Ralph Fiennes work, but the truly great things about this movie are the
effective Jewish performances and and the incredible art-direction this
movie has. Schindler's list is not a film for young kids, but everybody over
the age of 14 should see this great movie.
