First: is this a great and an important movie? Of course it is, like
all the films about the holocaust. Truly, have you ever seen a bad
movie (or series, or even a document for that matter) made about the
subject? I haven&#x27;t. Like most great, based-on-facts tragedies, stories
about concentration camps require too much serious thinking, talent and
at least adequate budget to start with before anything happens. (Also I
believe this is the reason for overall high quality of all the films
about Titanic disaster.) Filmmaker just couldn&#x27;t fail with real-life
drama of this magnitude in his hands. Neither could Mr. Spielberg.<br /><br />Well, still, even considering above-mentioned, Spielberg did an
excellent job. &#x22;Schindler&#x27;s List&#x22; is technically brilliant: beautifully
shot with its vast use of different camera distances and angles, and
stark b/w realization (which always adds extra-interest for modern day
film-enthusiastic). Cast is also superb (Liam Neeson to me is almost
the very personification of &#x27;trustworthy&#x27;) and set design perfect,
naturally, due to on-location shooting in Poland. The only, but
nevertheless quite notable complaint is length; the movie is by
definition unnecessarily overlong.<br /><br />So, why did Oskar Schindler do it? Now, I&#x27;m a Finn with some
German-Swedish heritage, and there&#x27;s very unlikely one Jewish cell in
my body. And I&#x27;m no bleeding-heart liberal either, pretty much vice
versa. But I&#x27;m an intelligent guy with very strong comprehension what
comes to &#x27;right&#x27; and &#x27;wrong&#x27;. So, given the same opportunities, money
and influence, I would had for sure at least attempted the same kind of
rescue-mission Schindler accomplished. Because I couldn&#x27;t bear either
just stand aside and watch an absolute and continuous torment of
innocents. That&#x27;s the very and simple reason for Schindler, a human
being, too: he HAD the money and chance to save those people and he
did. Only it took courage and an ability to successfully deal with
crazy monsters (Nazis). And I, too, think that when there&#x27;s a decision
between life and death to be made, money means nothing. So it&#x27;s so easy
for me to identify with Oskar Schindler. Only the world this rotten and
greedy even questions his motives.<br /><br />Still, one possible and a little more cynical explanation, which I
anyway think must had played at least minor part considering
Schindler&#x27;s (AND also that German officer&#x27;s in &#x22;The Pianist&#x22;) motives:
Germany had already clearly lost the war. One can only guess if they
would had acted exactly the same way in other circumstances...
