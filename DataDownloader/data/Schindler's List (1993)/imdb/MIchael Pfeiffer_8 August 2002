Schindler's list begins as the story of a man who believes he can use a
war
that takes millions of lives, and a Nazi regime that murders millions of
innocents, to turn a profit.
But as the story progresses he begins to see the human side of whats
going on, not just the profit margin. After learning of the hardships of
those imprisoned, and of the murderers who control the camps, he begins on
a
quest to try and save not only his soul but the soul of everyone around
him,
and to keep the flame of humanity lit during the dark destructive reign of
Hitler.
This is without a doubt the best film of Liam Neeson's career as well
as
the best film of Steven Spieldberg's career. It shows you how even during
a
time of chaos and evil, goodness can still be found. It also shows a level
of character development that I've never seen in a movie before or after
it
was released. Without a doubt the greatest movie about the time period of
World War II.
