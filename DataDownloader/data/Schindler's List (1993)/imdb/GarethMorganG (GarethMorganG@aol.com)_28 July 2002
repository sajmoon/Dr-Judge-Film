<br /><br />The greatest and most important film ever made. The acting is superb with 3
tour de force performances from Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes and Ben
Kingsley.<br /><br />It still remains as the academy's greatest disgrace that Neeson and Fiennes
did not pick up the Oscar for their performances.<br /><br />Spielberg delivers the undeliverable with a technical masterpiece. The film
is restrained considering the subject matter and the directors involvement
in the history. He could have gone for gross out but the horrors are all
the
more shocking for his restraint.<br /><br />The scene with Oskar Schindler walking into the street to find flakes
falling from the sky like snow and Amon Goeth standing by the mountain of
human bodies remains the greatest and most powerful scene in movie
history.<br /><br />The film deserves all the awards and plaudits and is now shown to 15 year
old schoolchildren in the school curiculum in England.<br /><br />This film is a complete and total masterpiece.
