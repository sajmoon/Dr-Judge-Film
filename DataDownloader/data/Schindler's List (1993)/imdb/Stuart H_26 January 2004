This film shows how low human beings can go in their treatment of each
other.  It shows how deeply people can care about each other.  It's all
true
and it clutches the heart strings like no other film I think I've ever
seen.<br /><br />This isn't a film where you leave on a massive high like watching superman
when you were a kid, wanting to run and jump and shout all the way home.
This film is dark.  This film's hero starts as a shallow man intent on
making money and not caring about how it happened.  He is changed into
something great and worthy by how he behaves when he becomes aware of the
reality of circumstances around him.<br /><br />Its gritty.  It should be compulsory viewing. It's a wonderful film.  But
it
really not going to cheer most people up.
