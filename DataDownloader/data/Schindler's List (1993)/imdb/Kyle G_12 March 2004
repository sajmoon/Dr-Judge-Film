Schindler's List (I affectionately call it &quot;Swindler's List&quot; sometimes) has
great acting in a great semi-fact-based story. Liam Neeson's acting was
&quot;Oskar&quot; nominated, but Ralph Fiennes was super as Goeth, and Kingsley was
excellent as well.<br /><br />Some great cinematography too - the candle smoke cutting to the train smoke,
for one (somewhat like TE Lawrence blowing out the match then cut to desert
sunrise, or &quot;2001&quot; bone to spaceship cut) and any of dozens of other
haunting images.<br /><br />Schindlers's List has some excellent dialog. Some examples are when
Schindler talks to Goethe about &quot;power&quot;, or Stern talking about the list
being &quot;absolute good&quot;, or Schindler crying because he could have saved more
people by giving away his Nazi pin or other personal items.<br /><br />Sentimental? Maybe. Many Spielberg movies are too sappy for me, but this was
not. Gloss over low-lights of Schindler himself? Probably. Doesn't really
matter, though.<br /><br />Not many &quot;better&quot; movies out there.
