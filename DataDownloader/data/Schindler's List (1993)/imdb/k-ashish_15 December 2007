Warning: My English is not that good.<br /><br />I m a huge fan of Spielberg movies, but i avoided watching this and
Saving Private Ryan for long. But now I say, this is the best movie I
have ever watched.<br /><br />The plot is known to all of us, I wont go into that. But watch it to
feel the power of emotions. If u don&#39;t cry, u must be a dead person.
For those who don&#39;t watch it thinking it will be boring, plzz give it a
30 mins try, i bet u will be hooked. So go and get the DVD now,
otherwise u will be missing one of the greatest movie wondering what
was in there.
