Based on the life of Notorious Nazi Party Manufacturer who uses Jewish
slave labour in his factory in Krakow. Spielberg&#39;s visual accounts of
the atrocities committed by Nazi&#39;s on the Jews is factual but
restricted as most were too horrific to show the general public. It is
a well known fact that the wealthy Jews bought their way into extended
&quot;Freedom&quot; by paying big bribes to actually work in Schindler&#39;s factory
rather than being shipped off to extermination camps. It is also
debatable as to how long the 1100 Jews Oscar Schindler &quot;saved&quot; would
have lasted as Jews were often worked as slaves until death after
Hitler&#39;s &quot;Final Solution&quot; was declared. <br /><br />There are more profound stories about German Officer&#39;s who turned
against their own when witnessing the atrocities by their fellow
Germans but the overwhelming fact remains that it is largest and most
efficiently executed act of genocide in Human History committed by one
Race over a particular race and religion. The Nazi&#39;s murdered six
million Jews of the six and half million in Europe and of the 275,000
survivors 250,00 had died by 1970. This represented two thirds of all
Jews in the world at the time. <br /><br />A great classic of a film with excellent performances by Ben Kingsley,
Liam Neeson and Larry Fiennes. It was a huge international box office
success but didn&#39;t too well in Australia.
