<br /><br />Wow. arn't we all amazed from the effect of the movie on
us.
Either it was the inhummanity or hummanity of man to man,both were equally
surprising. If Shindler was not real I would have thought that this movie
was a big 'stretch' and fake. The movie is an excellent proof of the
holocaust. But let us not forget that the holocaust
happened to the jews,but many other races.<br /><br />Now, looking at Shindler, and all the wonderfull things he has done<br /><br />to the jews. Why would a person like him who is a briber,
womanizer,
and a Nazi, even care ? Is it because the sake of saving lives?, is<br /><br />it for the sake of going against the flow or rules of the country?,is<br /><br />it for being bold?, is it to be loved and admired by a minority?, is to be
rememberd by history?, is it his duty assigned to him from god? or is it
to
fill a need iside himself?. These are some of many questions trying to
justify Shindler's actions. No one knows which are the
true
reasons for what Shindler did. Does anyone one know why Nazis were<br /><br />against the jews and many other races? It is an injustified and mad<br /><br />world. In my opinion this is the movie's theme. How could man
commit
such a terrible crime against fellow humans and how could some
people,
like Shindler, be kind enough to do such a good deed?
