Schindler&#x27;s List is one of the best films if better made. I think it
made my top ten list of all time movies. By the ending, I was all
choked up. It&#x27;s almost impossible for me to be choked up in a movie.
What made this film even more powerful than the content is that it was
filmed in black and white. It had a powerful effect on me and most
other viewers.<br /><br />This movie is about the transformation of a war profiteer and how he
goes from a self-centered businessman to a rescuer of Jews during the
second world war.<br /><br />The acting is unbelievable. I thought Liam Neeson was okay in the first
ten minutes then he really brought his acting skills to another level
after that. Ralph Fiennes was great. It was very easy to hate his
character.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg is a marvelous director. All of his movies I seen were
great ones and this may be his best. John Williams provided a
mesmerizing score that will haunt my mind for a long time.<br /><br />Overall, this is a emotional movie. This makes me hate Hitler and his
SS pigs even more for what they did to these poor people. I rate this
film 10/10.
