The movie, Schindler's list is a very powerful and emotional film. It had
great casting by Liam Neeson, who played Oskar and excellent acting by the
fellow cast. The script couldn't have been wrote any better, and together
with the horrible facts produced a film which is both informative and
moving. You'll never see another one like it. However, as it was filmed in
black and white it wasn't as clear I would have liked, although it makes it
seem a little ore realistic.<br /><br />It certainly deserves 9/10
