Schindlers List reflects the horror of WWII.  The only color used in<br /><br />this movie is the red coat of the girl who gets caught up in the war,<br /><br />just like everyone else.  So much feeling can be invoked when<br /><br />seeing this;  Oscar Schindler is a hero who used the Jews in<br /><br />factories, keeping them safe from concentration camps.  The<br /><br />plight of the Jews can be felt in this movie.
