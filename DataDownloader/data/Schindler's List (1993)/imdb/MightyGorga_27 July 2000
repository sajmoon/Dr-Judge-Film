This film is almost too poignant to put into words.  Liam Neeson creates a
Schindler who is simultaneously a deeply flawed and compassionate man - in
other words, a real, fully rounded human being, one of the best portrayals
in motion picture history.  Also sublime are Ben Kingsley as Stern,
Schindler's bookkeeper and confidante, and Ralph Fiennes, whose Amon Goeth
reminds us just how dark and twisted the human soul can become.  No film has
ever done better at capturing the depth of suffering that was the Holocaust.
 A work of genius - easily the finest film of the 1990s, and one of the
greatest ever.
