I've seen this movie about six times, and I'm still amazed at how realistic
it is.  I can't understand how anyone can rubbish this film, they must be
very cold people.  You just can't rubbish a film that is based on the deaths
of many innocent jews.  <br /><br />The acting by Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes was superb.  This film is up
there with classics like 'Ben Hur' and 'The Ten Commandments.'
