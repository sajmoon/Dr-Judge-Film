Extremely well written drama centered around the horrors taking place within
the Holocaust of World War II. But, I don't think the Holocaust is entirely
the point. The point is moral choice and the ability to choose freely even
when everything around you has gone to hell; and a real hell at
that.<br /><br />So many millions lost their lives in the Holocaust, and for that I pay my
respects. But is a film good simply because of it's subject matter? Some
people seem to think so. But I don't. I think this particular film is good
because of it's pace, good writing, good acting, and good
music.<br /><br />And surprisingly Spielberg attempts to create a style of his own here;
unlike his plagiarizing Kurosowa's action film techniques. It's so subtle,
but at times it is highly artistic for a Hollywood director.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes is brilliant as Amon Goeth - in probably the best performance
of the entire film. It's brutal and he takes no prisoners. For which I feel
he deserved the best supporting actor Oscar.<br /><br />One nice moral point of the story is conveyed through showing the one little
girl in red. In doing this the film suggests not to classify it as tragedy
for the millions who died, but in terms of tragedy on purely personal levels
for each of those 6 million (give or take) people. Each of them suffered,
and each of them are remembered as such.<br /><br />B+: Fans of actors, directors, or material should give it a look. It's worth
your time.
