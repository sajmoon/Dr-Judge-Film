&quot;History repeats itself, the first time as tragedy, the second time as
farce&quot; Said by Karl Marx. The Holocuast is one of the worst tragedies
to befall humanity. True we have genocides, and holocausts today, in
Rwanda, Chechnya. This is the first time though that a few madmen
seduced a nation. Complancency was not a choice. The Jews had no way to
fight back without the allies. There is no reason to assume that most
who watch this film are not believers of the HOlocaust. But in case you
are take it from someone who lost half of her family. It was real and
the evidence survived. God I pray it is never like this ever again. &quot;If
you want peace work for justice&quot; -Gandhi-.
