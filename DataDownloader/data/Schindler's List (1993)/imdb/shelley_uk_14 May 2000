I can honestly say that this is one of the truly great films. The way it
creates and image of one of the most tragic periods of human history both
educates and moves us as well as providing a fitting testament to those who
died, and because it deals with a subject which will never be forgotten it
is a film which will always be relevant, thus making it a timeless work
which throughly deserves the recognition that it received.
