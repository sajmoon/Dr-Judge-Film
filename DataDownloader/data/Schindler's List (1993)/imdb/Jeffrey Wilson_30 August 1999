This is one of the saddest movies I've ever seen, yet it is uplifting to
hear a story about a man who cared so much.  In a time of great sadness and
tragedy, it's nice to know that not all men were mad with thoughts of world
dominance.  Oscar Schindler earned the praise that this movie gives him.  Of
course anything Steven Spielberg makes is almost destined for greatness.  I
applaud Mr. Schindler for his courageous actions in World War II and Mr.
Spielberg for giving Schindler his due respect.  This movie gives you a
feeling that is almost unexplainable.  And That is what movies are all
about.
