Many people have told me how devastated they were when they saw this
movie.
But I was just bored. We talked about it and, in the discussions that
followed, I was accused of not caring about the victims of the Holocaust.
One person even said I was denying the Holocaust happened!<br /><br />And that soured me on the movie even more. The fact is, Holocaust movies
have insurance against criticism: if you say the movie is a waste of time,
someone might attribute your opinion to the Holocaust itself. I don't
understand it, but that weird emotional blackmail made me really
uncomfortable with Schindler's List.<br /><br />I thought Liam Neeson was horrible. His acting is very stiff and
unconvincing. The use of hand-held cameras and black-and-white
cinematography *should* work, but ultimately they amounted to subtle
special
effects.<br /><br />I thought the movie was emotionally flat, as well. I watched each
character
go through the motions, wondering when something unexpected would happen.
The horror of the Holocaust is shown in an almost clinical
way.<br /><br />I don't know. I just felt that this movie would feel less like a bid for
an
Oscar and more like a personal film.<br /><br />At the risk of being a complete jerk, I'll give Spielberg this advice: Do
it
again. Make another Holocaust movie. Why not? He finished Kubrick's &quot;AI.&quot;
Kubrick had another movie in the planning stages, a Holocaust film called
&quot;Aryan Papers&quot; (aka &quot;Wartime Lies&quot;). I hope he'll finish *that* Kubrick
movie, too, and create a better Holocaust film, something I can sink into
and be surprised by, something that feels much more personal.<br /><br />
