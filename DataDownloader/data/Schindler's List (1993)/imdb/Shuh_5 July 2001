<br /><br />Except for the fact that this is really 3 or 4 small films ( as if written
by a committee ),  this is your typical ham-fisted Spielberg flick.  When it
wants to be an art-film it fails,  because it really isn't an art film. 
When it wants to be a Kubrick-film it fails,  becuase it really isn't a
Kubrick film.  When it wants to be a character-study it fails,  because
again it won't concentrate on any one thing.<br /><br />I suspect many will automatically give this the thumbs-up simply because it
is supposed to honor the memory of those that survived the holocaust --
these people I salute.  People who think this really is a great film -- I
have to wonder about.
