book written by Thomas Keneally; 1993 film based on the altruistic
activity of Oskar Schindler during the Nazi internment and
extermination of Jews (the movie is named after a list of names of
1,200 Jewish people that Oskar Schindler hired to work in his factory
and saved them from being sent to concentration camps) Thomas Keneally
Thomas Michael Keneally (born October 7, 1935) also Tom Keneally, is an
Australian novelist. He was known as &quot;Mick&quot; until 1964 but began using
the name Thomas when he started publishing, in the hope that family
would be less able to identify him as the author. [1] He is perhaps
most famous for his Schindler&#39;s Ark (1982), which won the Booker Prize
and is the basis of the film Schindler&#39;s List. Many of his novels are
reworkings of historical material, although modern in their psychology
and style.
