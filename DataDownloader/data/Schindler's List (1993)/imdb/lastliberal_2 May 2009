Winner of seven Oscars. it should have won all of the ones it was
nominated for. It won a total of 63 awards. has any film won more? The
film stands far above the rest and will do so for all time.<br /><br />It was the detritus that was being picked over after the trains left
for the camps that really struck me. The pile of photos were especially
hard to take. The memories recorded for lifetimes to be consumed by
fire.<br /><br />It was after Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) arrived, that Oskar Schindler
(Liam Neeson) slowly realized he had something more to do than make
money. At least the British film critics and the BAFTA recognized
Fiennes performance. It is too bad that Neeson didn&#x27;t fare as well.<br /><br />Ben Kingsley was also fantastic as Schindler&#x27;s accountant.<br /><br />A stain on history that will never be forgotten. Impossible to watch
with bringing a tear to your eye.
