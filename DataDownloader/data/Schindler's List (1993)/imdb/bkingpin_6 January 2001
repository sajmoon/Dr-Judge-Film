This is an outstanding movie. In my opinion, this is Steven Spielbergs
finest work. The film does an outstanding job in showing the lives of the
Jewish people and what it must have been like to have to live during World
War II. It also does a great job in showing how Schindler lived and changed
the lives of so many Jewish people.
