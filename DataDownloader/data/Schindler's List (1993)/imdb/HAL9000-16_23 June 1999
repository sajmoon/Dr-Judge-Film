I'll admit that after seeing Schindler's List, I was moved, but not nearly
as moved as when I saw Spielberg's second and better masterpiece, Saving
Private Ryan. For some odd reason, however, Schindler's List did not appeal
to me as much as it did to several other film fans. But, I am not saying in
any way that this was a mediocre film. The cinematography was excellent,
the
acting superior and the film itself was very touching, however I found some
parts in this film difficult to watch, especially after 3 hr. 20 min. of
it.
(especially the too long graveyard scene at the end) Schindler's List is a
great historically important film, but in my opinion it just doesn't rise
to
the level of excellence as in some of my other favorite films, such as
2001:
A Space Odyssey, The Godfather, Star Wars, and Amadeus.
But you should still see this film, specifically for its historical
importance.
