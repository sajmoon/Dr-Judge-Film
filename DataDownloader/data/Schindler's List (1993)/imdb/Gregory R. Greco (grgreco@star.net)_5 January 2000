Schindler's List is a vivid character portrait of a flawed man who made
heroic choices under the toughest of circumstances.  Steven Spielberg has
found a wonderful story, and has told it with pain, passion, and wisdom that
is rare in today's cinema.  In this three hour tale, Spielberg has at once
shown us the horror of war, and has given us a story of courage and heroism
to overcome it.  Strong performances by Liam Neelson as Oscar Schindler, Ben
Kingsley, and Ralph Feinnes enhanced the strength of this painful and
touching story.  Even a schmaltzy ending cannot take away the beauty and
power of this heroic tale, beautifully told.
