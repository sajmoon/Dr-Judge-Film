At the age of 15 every schoolchild in the world should be strapped to a
 chair and made to watch this film, plus Amistad, Private Ryan, Paths of
 Glory [about WWl], Sophie's Choice and The Killing Fields.
If this package is not an effective antidote to war, racism and bigotry I
 despair of ever getting the message over.
