<br /><br />Is this the perfect film ?
I believe so.
So film has more astonishing acting than Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley
(no
acting oscars!)
The most extraordinary handling of this subject, wonderful cinematography,
editing superb andthe overall look of the film is something that stays
with
you.<br /><br />A movie that will last its generations.
