I guess I was lucky in that I knew nothing about the movie before I first
saw it (an accident too involved to explain here!). I was therefore not
affected by the usual &quot;Speilberg masterpiece&quot; hyperbole that seemed to
attach itself to any review. Subsequent viewings have however confirmed that
this is in fact a Masterpiece in the truest sense of the word.Take out the
&quot;quirky&quot; black &amp; white photography, which I actually found to be a bit of a
wank, (the jews and nazis experienced this all in real colour not in mono in
a sterile cinema), the feel and strength of the photography made me weep...
I was there, I was a victim. That probably sounds very pretentious from a
white, middle class, Catholic Australian, but if a movie can move me the way
this did, it must have something going for it. I have seen this movie 4
times now and although the shock value has been diminished somewhat, the
message remains... ignorance is deadly!  His best work by far.. including
the very, very over-rated &quot;pseudo horror&quot; flick Saving Private
Ryan.
