Undoubtedly, this is a masterpiece, one of the most recent
ones created in cinema history. Can a movie about the
holocaust be beautiful? Of course it can, and here we have
an example. We have more than three hours
of poetry about the human nature, about love, about hate,
about madness, about egoism, about altruism, all of them
mixed to produce the human being as what it really is.
It's a film that cleans our soul, makes us feel like
humans, and makes us understand a little bit better
the aim of the Human Race. John Williams gave the most
beautiful sound-track he ever created to set the emotional
background this film needed.
