This movie could be the best one I&#39;ve ever seen.Besides, it&#39;s my
favourite.<br /><br />Till this moment, I&#39;ve watched it 5 times and still haven&#39;t got enough
of it. It simply haunted my life. Since then I kept recommending it for
everybody I know to see it and none of those who have seen it regretted
buying or renting the DVD. They all admitted that it worths every
penny.<br /><br />Simply, it&#39;s a fable that teaches you valuable lessons in life. Once
you&#39;ve seen this movie and grasped its message your view to the concept
of life and humanity will never be the same.<br /><br />I&#39;ve always heard and read about the horrors the Jews had experienced
during the WW2 &amp; about The Nazis&#39; inhuman treatment and torture to them
but I&#39;ve never imagined the tragedy as this movie pictures it. It
really cuts to the core of you and moves you. I cried and weeped for
about half of the running time and for the rest I was utterly thrilled.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, I believe that it&#39;s the peak of Steven Spielberg&#39;s
work.<br /><br />What firstly brought my attention to this movie is that it was ranked
9th in the American Film Institute list of the 100 greatest movies
which made it the best movie in the 80s and 90s.<br /><br />Now and after I&#39;ve watched it, I think it should be ranked not less
than 3rd (1st:Casablanca / 2nd:The Godfater).<br /><br />Long story short, it&#39;s a must-see. And if you haven&#39;t watched it yet ,
then don&#39;t waste your money or time watching loads of silly romantic
comedies of nowadays and start watching the classics.
