I had to watch the movie for an English project and I thought that it
was going to be so bad, so I put it off for as long as possible. Then
when I actually did have to watch it, I absolutely loved it. It is a
true story, it's shot beautifully in black and white, and the actors
are awesome. They portray the people with such skill. But, I do warn,
it is graphic. That makes it all the better, because it shows the
actually of the events.I would most definitely recommend this movie.
Watch This Movie Now!
