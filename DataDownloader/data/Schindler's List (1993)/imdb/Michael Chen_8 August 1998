SCHINDLER'S LIST is undoubtedly one of the best films ever made. In my
 opinion, THE best. Steven Spielberg's mastery in directing was acknowledged
 with countless awards, and the film was on the top of everyone's year-end
 Top 10. Nobody dared to deny. The powerful performances of Liam Neeson and
 Ralph Fiennes were recognised as Oscar nominees. Both of them were close to
 taking the statuettes. Ben Kingsley's leading of a flawless supporting cast
 with a perfected screenplay by Steven Zaillian from Thomas Keneally's book
 SCHINDLER'S ARC (now often called SCHINDLER'S LIST to abide with the film)
 make this touching film essential viewing. Spielberg accepted the
 frightening assignment on the six years of horror himself, and did so with
 such flair, style, insight, and perfection, that no films that year even
 came close enough to be made comparable to, needless to say upstage, the
 masterpiece. With renowned cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, the film was
 photographed in black and white aside from the ingenious use of colour to
 gather attention. The captivating score earned John Williams another Oscar.
 Nominated for 12 Academy Awards and attained seven in a year of highly
 regarded films. But none so high as SCHINDLER'S LIST. This will be one of
 the most moving film experiences ever offered. I have seen the film five
 times to relive this experience. This film is not just three hours of watch
-and-forget. This film will stay with you forever.
