Spielberg brought a controversial, depressing and dark topic and turned it
into a beautiful movie. That's what makes it so excellent. Everything, every
detail in the film is perfect, from the costumes to the script. Spielberg
made a serious film in a time when making movies like this were not the
&quot;conventional&quot; film style. Spielberg did it, and succeeded in doing so. The
A.M.P.A.S. found the film deserving of nearly every major Oscar, including
Best Picture and Director, and so did every major film critics society.
Schindler's List made AFI's 100 Greatest List, and grabbed the 9 spot in
doing so. Spielberg, a man known for making Jaws and E.T., made Schindler's
List, the same year as making the record breaking Jurrasic Park. Steven
Spielberg also did something no other person had done before. An amazing
movie from an amazing director. A true masterpiece! 10/10, 4/4,
5/5!
