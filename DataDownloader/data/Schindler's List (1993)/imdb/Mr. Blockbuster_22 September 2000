Schindler's List is Spielberg's masterpiece.  It is brilliant, horrifying,
dramatic, and artistic.  It's simply one of the most powerful films I've
ever seen, and it reminds us of the horrors that mankind has suffered as
well as what we've committed.  <br /><br />This is a film that everyone needs to own, so they can watch  it at least
once a year.
