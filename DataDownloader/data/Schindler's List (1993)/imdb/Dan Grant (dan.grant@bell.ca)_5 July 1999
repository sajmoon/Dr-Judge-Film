Human beings are the only species that kills for sport and hunts for
pleasure.  We may be the only species ( next to a cat ) that takes joy in
killing and torturing another person or animal.  Why God gave us the
capacity to experience these heinous emotions and desires is beyond me.
But
for whatever reason, we do have them, and the Holocaust is one of the
darkest periods in our existence as human beings.  There certainly are
other
dark times but this one is the most talked about and famous.  And before I
saw this film, I knew the Holocaust was horrible, but when you can put
visuals to the words, it gives you a whole new appreciation and
understanding of what is one disgusting display of inhumanity towards a
people.  And from a man that gave us films like Jaws and Close Encounters
of
the Third Kind, many may have not expected to see a masterpiece like this.
But no one should ever be surprised at what Spielberg can accompish.<br /><br />Schindler's List gives you the horror right in your mind.  It paints
pictures in front of you and you cringe with every stroke of cinematic
genius that is presented before you.  I felt sad and disgusted to watch
the
horrors before me.  It made me sick to see that humans could be so cruel.
Do we not have any compassion towards the living?  Apparently not.  And
this
film shows that, along with Mississippi Burning, Platoon, Saving Private
Ryan and even pictures like Boyz N The Hood, we are a sad creation and one
that whoever is the supreme ruler of us has got to be angry at the way we
turned out.<br /><br />This is one of the most important films ever made and it also one of the
most disturbing.  I walked out of the theater and when we drove home
 there
was four of us ) not one word was uttered for at least a half an hour.  It
was like it took us that long to process what we had just witnessed.  When
the converstion did start, it went deep into the night and early into the
morning.  It will provoke that kind of reaction from most
everybody.<br /><br />As important and as brilliant of a film as this is ( I rate it a ten out
of
ten ) I only saw it once at the theater and then only through the most
persistant of begging, once more on video four years later.  It disturbed
me
too much.  The images were too real for me and it gave me nightmares for a
few days later.  What Spielberg has done here is not only make an
important
film, he has taken a subject that causes so many people pain and he has
opened it up for the rest of us to understand.  And for that, no Oscar can
ever repay him for his contribution to society.  I know I am a changed
person because of this film.  And to me, Saving Private Ryan could have
almost been an unofficial sequel to Schindler's List.  They both have
opened
my eyes to the horrors that mankind has caused.<br /><br />Schindler's List and
Saving Private Ryan are proof that Speilberg is the king of Hollywood.  I
sincerely hope he makes an Indy 4, but I hope he continues to make films
that make us think.  Because he is damn good at those ones too.
