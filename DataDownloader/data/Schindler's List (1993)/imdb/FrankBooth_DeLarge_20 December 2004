Schindler's list is a film that really handles the horrors of the
holocaust, gives you a deep look at it, and almost makes you feel as
though you're there with the characters. It is depressing as you see
what people had to go through in the concentration camps.<br /><br />Two other excellent elements of the film are the fact that it has the
best on screen hero ever, and one of the best on screen villains ever.
The best on screen hero is Oscar Schindler because of how he sacrifices
profitable business to save innocent people from the wrath of Hitler.
One of the best on screen villain ever is Ralph Fiennes character.
Ralph Fiennes character is one of the Nazis who has no heart and kills
for sport. The key to having a good villain is having them be as
heartless and horrible as possible. That's definitely what this
character succeeds at.<br /><br />This film is excellent and will have an impact on you unlike any other.
If you haven't seen it, see it now.
