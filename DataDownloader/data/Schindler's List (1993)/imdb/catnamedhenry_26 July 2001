I actually went to this movie by myself. Good thing. Near the middle of
the
movie I gave up trying to hold in my tears and had to struggle to at least
make my sobs inaudible. It was heart-wrenching on so many levels. Namely
the
unspeakable horrors that were commited against the Jews. But also, the
inner
struggle of a man having to come to terms with his own morality.<br /><br />
