This movie is not entertainment, but terrible history that sadly goes on
today. Not like in the movie, but in smaller groups around the whole world.<br /><br />This movie contains more true love and hate than any movie, it has happen.
Some people deny this, well, to deny is to commit suicide. They killed
people like you and me. People with a reason to live. Oscar Schindler had a
lot of feelings inside, thats why his breakdown at the end when he leaves.
He showed feelings that he was not used to show. The meanings are severals,
but always remember this: Nobody can save everybody, but everybody can save
one...
If you want to see this film, pick a day when your feelings are strong. It
is important to let everybody understand history, and to really start to
love each other.
Must this movie stand as a monument for LOVE..<br /><br /> From Ingar Einar to the whole world and Steven
