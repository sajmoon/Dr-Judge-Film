This film trivialises the holocaust. Unlike most of your reviewers, and
like
most normal people, I did know a bit about the subject before Schindler's
List came out. I didn't need to be told that this was a shameful episode
in
history, and that it should not be repeated. The existence of this film
won't make a toss of difference when the next crackpot decides to kill
whichever race he has a grudge against, and it won't activate his
acquiescing public. Spielberg obviously set out to enlighten us on the
holocaust, but for me it made it more distant. We barely got to know any
Jewish character that was immediately under threat, and the only character
that was explored with any depth was Schindler, the hero - the most
audience-friendly element. To film in black and white was a ridiculous
decision - tantamount to Spielberg just saying, 'Yes, I know that this is
a
serious subject, but I'm going to deflect your attention and make the
whole
experience less real.'. Such is the way of cinema.
