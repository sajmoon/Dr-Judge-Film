All the people say about it is true! Schindler&#x27;s List is simply
remarkable! No other movie has never shown the horrific thing&#x27;s that
the people in death camps, including not only Jew&#x27;s but everyone, were
witnesses and part of every single day! Very well done! And i give a
big credit for it to a producer, BRANKO LUSTIG, who was an AUSCHWITZ
surviver when he was a little kid. I&#x27;m sure, as Spielberg sais, that he
had a big influence on this movie.<br /><br />------------------------- <br /><br />The directing is amazingly beautiful and this is one of the best
directed movies ever. I like how it was shot in black and white. It
gave a lot of dept to certain scenes and the whole movie. I especially
liked the certain part&#x27;s such as the one when we see a little girl in
red coat in the distance and everything except her coat is in black and
white. That was a beautiful scene. It really seals in your memory! As
does the other part when we see the little girl in the red coat. I also
liked the part at which a couple of Jews are praying around the candle
and everything except for the fire of the candle is in black and white!
Such a great scene! You can really sympathize with them! <br /><br />-------------------------- <br /><br />Writing is just great! The best part about it is characterization! I
like the way Schindler was shown. How he was nothing but an idiot in
the beginning and didn&#x27;t care about anything or anyone except for his
own pocket which he later on completely emptied in order to save the
lives of his workers which were brutally killed every single day. I
especially loved the character of AMON GOETH! What a great portrayal of
a sick and evil man that&#x27;s even kinda charming at times. I really loved
his character. Simply perfect! It belong&#x27;s to the movie history. As
does the entire movie! And Ralph Fiennes was excellent! Liam Neeson and
Ben Kingsley were also great. Though, Ralph steals the show here!!! <br /><br />---------------------------<br /><br />Another thing i must mention is music! John Williams composed something
beautiful! I&#x27;m usually a big fan of Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll but i just can&#x27;t stop
listening to this song or a score, whatever it is! It&#x27;s really
beautiful and i&#x27;m sure it will be remembered and listened in two
hundred year&#x27;s from now because it&#x27;s just outstanding!!! The violin
sound&#x27;s like it&#x27;s crying! Beautiful!!!! <br /><br />---------------------------- <br /><br />A perfect movie that deserves to be remembered and that, i&#x27;m sure, will
be remembered just as the event&#x27;s it show&#x27;s and all the people that
been through &#x27;em! WATCH IT UNDER ANY COST!!!! SIMPLY GREAT!!!!
