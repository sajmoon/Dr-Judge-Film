Every scene in Schindler&#x27;s List is a thread being woven into a tapestry
of pure humanity. The film has a conventional climax, but only in the
final scene do we reach the emotional climax, where the tapestry
attains completion and perfection. Per Jewish tradition, many stones
are placed upon Oskar Schindler&#x27;s grave, and then -- while you hear
Itzhak Perlman&#x27;s violin soar to its most sorrowful note -- a single
rose.<br /><br />At that moment, your heart will simply break.<br /><br />- &#x22;GPS Pilot&#x22; <br /><br />USA
