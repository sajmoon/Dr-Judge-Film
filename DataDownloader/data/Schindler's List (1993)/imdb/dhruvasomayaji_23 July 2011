It is said &#x22;power corrupts; but absolute power corrupts absolutely&#x22;.
This movie just gives a glimpse of the possible effects if the power is
vested with some insane person with a mindless hatred towards a group
of people just because of their birth. <br /><br />I had not judged Hitler to the fullest before seeing this movie even
though many were condemning him to be the cruelest dictator the world
has ever seen. After seeing it, I am convinced of the fact that he was
really so. The fact that 6 million Jews were massacred during the world
war-2 just because they were Jews is a shame on the entire humanity.<br /><br />The movie gives an account of the polish Jews during the Second World
War and how the protagonist, Oscar Schindler saves 1200 Jews from being
gassed. The cinematography is simply brilliant. It gives a sense of
timelessness to the movie. Also, not to forget some wonderful
performances. All factors make the movie very realistic. No wonder it
is one of the best movies in many lists and deservedly won the academy
award for the year 1993. Steven Spielberg will be remembered as an
iconic director even if all of his other movies are discounted.<br /><br />In the days where negationism of the Nazis&#x27; atrocities is getting
stronger and the killings are being justified, this movie is a harsh
reminiscence of the black era of Europe.
