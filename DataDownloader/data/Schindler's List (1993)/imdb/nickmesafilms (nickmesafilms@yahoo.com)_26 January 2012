Known to all audiences as one of the greatest movies ever made,
&#x22;Schindler&#x27;s List&#x22; is biographical drama of Oskar Schindler, a German
businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand Polish-Jews
during the Holocaust, and employing them in his factories. This could
affect the lives of many Jews during this terrible event in history.
With a 3-hour running time, a marvelous script, and a breathtaking
directing duty from the legendary Steven Spielberg, &#x22;Schindler&#x27;s List&#x22;
is one of the greatest movies ever made on screen. Liam Neeson delivers
his best performance as Oskar Schindler, and this guy really brings
truth and charm to his character, and it lets you see that he has
transformed into this iconic figure. Ralph Fiennes portrays a
scene-stealing performance as SS-officer Amon Goth, with a cruel
villainy to his character that is just awesome to watch on screen. Ben
Kingsley, Embeth Davidtz, and Caroline Goodall round up the supporting
cast, and they all create a powerful casting ensemble. Director Steven
Spielberg succeeds once again, directing such a fine masterpiece, that
led him to two Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture. This
film may be lacking for the first couple of hours, but it does not
change the fact that this movie is a sensational piece of work. Some
moments make you furious, some moments make you cry, and this is the
type of movie that you are going to feel bad about, but you&#x27;ll still
enjoy it. The art direction is sensational, the editing is superb, the
cinematography is just masterful, and John Williams&#x27; score is
completely breathtaking. But it&#x27;s Spielberg himself that guides this
movie. His directing has made a big impact on the face of cinema, and
he improves once again, making one of the greatest films he has ever
made. This movie is dramatic and heartbreaking, but this also a
challenging and emotionally moving motion picture, and Spielberg never
disappoints. &#x22;Schindler&#x27;s List&#x22;, in my review, &#x22;an epic and
heartbreaking Spielberg masterpiece&#x22;.
