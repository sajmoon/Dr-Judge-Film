this movie is really awesome, really awesome!!! what a great
performance by Liam Neeson!! in the beginning it is very boring, but
later on, the movie is dramatic and very tough. when you realize that
this really happened during the war-time, you can cry again... Ben
Kingsley played remarkable good. the whole story you are hoping that he
will survive and yes he did survive (his character)! my Mother was
crying during the movie. and at the end he (Oscar) was so upset about
the fact that he could not rescue more! and all the Jews were saving
rings, earrings and more to make him a present!!! this movie is really
worth the academy awards it has been given!!! a masterpiece just like
the pianist. we always must remember what happened in the past and we
have to learn how to avoid it in the future!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
