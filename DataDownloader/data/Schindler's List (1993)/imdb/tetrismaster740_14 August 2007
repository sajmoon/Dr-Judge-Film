I never thought that Schindler&#39;s List was going to be as good as it was
when I first watched the movie. A year later it is still amazing how
much this movie impacted me. It&#39;s hard to put into words how perfect
this movie was, which is why this review will seem very simple. Yet, I
guess that perfect is the exact word for Schindler&#39;s List. It is beyond
me how some people do not like this masterpiece or how some people do
not think that the Holocaust happened. To the people who do not like
this film, you do not know what a movie is and are probably to busy
watching movies like Epic Movie. And to those think the Holocaust never
happened, well than you just go on believing that BS, cause it did
happen. All I know is that this is the only real movie that has brought
me to tears. Truly a perfect movie that I am not sure will ever be
surpassed.
