well, again, it was R(A) here and i really guessed why when i watched it on
VCD borrowed from my tutor. (maybe too many slaughters...but SAVING PRIVATE
RYAN was not R(A)...) but i'm still glad that i was lucky enough to
encounter this film. i've read the novel before so i roughly had an idea
about the story, yet the movie impressed me. black-and-white filming is
certainly a factor - as in TO KILL THE MOCKING BIRD - and i was totally
drawn into the story and the acting, thinking of the scenes from the novel
as i watched. and needless to comment on the little girl in red - as she
moved down the staircase fading into darkness i was almost
crying.<br /><br />but when i say this film is 'staying' it doesn't only refer to the plot and
the camera work. John William's music has to be mentioned for its sheer
shattering beauty. years after i watched the movie i could still recall how
the violin sang and cried when i played the theme on the piano.
