When I recommend this movie to friends who haven&#39;t seen it, I always
get the same answer...&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s excellent, but it&#39;s got to
be depressing.&quot; I teach high school honors history and every spring I
show my seniors this movie as part of a World War II unit. Ten
graduating classes have experienced it. Spielberg has never been
better. His one-two punch with this film and 1998&#39;s Saving Private Ryan
should be required viewing. I was vindicated this summer when the
American Film Institute ranked Schindler&#39;s List #3 in its latest Top
100 film series, Most Inspiring Films. Over the years my students have
agreed with me...this film about mankind&#39;s darkest hour and the horrors
of the Holocaust ends on a most beautiful and hopeful note. Spielberg&#39;s
use of color in a black and white film, though simply done, is the most
powerful thing I have ever seen in film-making.
