I saw this movie last month and was extremely disappointed and at the
same time really happy. Disappointed at the fact that I took so long to
watch this movie and happy that I didn&#39;t miss it out!!!!<br /><br />Definitely the BEST movie I&#39;ve ever seen. The direction,
cinematography, acting...in fact everything was really good. But at
times I felt some scenes were too long, especially the torturing
scenes. But then I realized that maybe these scenes really gave the
over all impact to the movie. This movie is shown at the backdrop of
one of the most darkest period of human history (World War II).... Its
shown in black and white due to that very reason!!!!! This is the
shocking true story of Oskar Schindler, who never lost his sight when
everyone from his own land were blind, who never lost humanity when he
was surrounded by animals!!!<br /><br />Never before have I got so involved with a character in a movie that I
felt each and everything that went through Schindler&#39;s mind. Who do I
have to praise that for, the style of direction or the well written
script???? In the climax part when Schindler breaks down to tears I was
shocked to find myself break down to tears for the first time after
seeing a Movie!!!! Thats the power of this film!!!!!<br /><br />If there is anyone else out there who hasn&#39;t seen this movie yet then
PLZ....Please....Don&#39;t waste your time reading this or any review,
instead rush and watch this movie as soon as possible!!!! In fact this
has to be watched by everyone at least once in their lifetime, not for
the purpose of entertainment but for a wonderful LESSON!!!!!
