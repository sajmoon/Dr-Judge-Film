The shear beauty of Liam Neeson's performance of this thrilling story, is
just the start. The directing and casting capture the moment superbly and
make it invigorating to watch.
A none-negotiable 10/10.
One of the best films ever made.
Better than the lord of the rings..... ALL 3 PUT TOGETHER
The justice in the film is based upon peoples lives and what they went
through.
Adolf Hitler is only shown 2 or 3 times which is the beauty because it
puts
across a broader view and more facts are encouraged.
