I must admit I was stunned! With so many bad movies, with no substance
at all, it&#x27;s wonderful to know that those kind of movies like
&#x22;Schindler&#x27;s List&#x22; prove to us that masterpieces are still possible.
Congrats, Steven Spielberg!!! The movie presents an apparently vain
character who wants to gain profit with his business, by employing only
Hebrew people, because they are paid less( they aren&#x27;t paid at all,
only the taxes for them are paid). Through the movie we are given the
chance to see some great and very very moving frames of the
Holocaust...women and old people are being killed in front of our eyes,
humiliation and cruelty is being presented as if it would happen right
now...it is a lesson to learn and it is history relieved in a traumatic
way. The movie is tragic, but the fact that Schindler acts in such a
humanitarian way is reassuring for us to know that...after so many
crimes and so much evil, there still is GOOD in us. This movie is a
MUST if you wanna watch an unforgettable movie!
