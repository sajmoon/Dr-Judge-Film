Mr.Spielberg confronted his Jewish background head-on when he began the
long, hard journey of completing this film.Clearly no one could have made
this movie quite like he did.I know when I watched this, I found myself
cringing at the horrible events that took place during perhaps the
grimmest
chapter in the world's history, the Holocaust.
Although this has raw footage of unimaginable events, there are also
great stories and character studies involved.You become close to the
people
in the film.
This movie is almost, if not completely, flawless.From its incredible
direction to its effective editing and black and white presentation.From
its
music, cinematography, and impressive cast, this movie will remain in your
memory for the rest of your life.
