There is no love story good enough to be able to be compared to this movie.
The love showing up on this movie, is much bigger than any story! The love
for keeping people alive! This is one of the best movies ever done. We all
have to thank Steven Spielberg to be so great and being able to this all of
this movies! SO THANK YOU. He did just as great in Saving Private
Ryan!
The images in this movie, makes it closer to the time that was done. Makes
it more real, more believable. The photography is just ART! the acting is
great. the screen play is material to read at Junior's classes (not the
Scarlet letter, or however is called that book!). Is movie that should be
watched at History class, because shows IN A PERFECT WAY how it was, and if
it doesn't then better not know what really happen at that
war!
We just have to sit down and clap to this movie, that I would call THE
BIGGEST MASTERPIECE ever done for a screen.
Thanks Steven for giving the humanity the oportunity to have this
movie!!!!
