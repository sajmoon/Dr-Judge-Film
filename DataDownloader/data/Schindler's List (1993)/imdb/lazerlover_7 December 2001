a tremendous achievement. heartwrenching and powerful beyond words.
acting is first rate. Spieldberg&#39;s best. whoever dislikes this
masterpiece is either dead or knows nothing about what an amazing
motion picture is all about. if you are not moved to tears watching
this &quot;film of the &#39;90&#39;s&quot;, then rush out and get a heart transplant!
