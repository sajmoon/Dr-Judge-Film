It gets a rare 10/10 from me although it is not on my Top 10 List,
mostly because it isn't a movie that anyone really enjoys watching as
much as one that needs to be watched. In any case I sure can't be in a
laid back mindset ready to watch an action flick and substitute
Schindler's List at the last second; I gotta be ready for it.<br /><br />I've watched it 3-4 times, the first time in a theater with my sister
who was dying of cancer and wanted to see it. I remember one of her
sons theorized that the Holocaust never happened and it was a way to
justify the destruction of the Nazi regime, or some other BS, that I've
heard variations of before. They just don't have any grounding in
history. Even the Nazis who were hung for it didn't deny it; they were
just following orders.<br /><br />Its quite a movie with all the talent both on and off the screen doing
some of their best work ever. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes really
should've won Oscars, but it won so many others I suppose they wanted
to spread them around a little.<br /><br />The fairly recently released DVD package is a bit of a throwback with
an odd case and a single double-sided DVD. If there's some special
reason for it I don't know what it is. It has a DTS soundtrack but the
B&amp;W video was quite harsh on my screen with very bright interior
lighting sometimes bombing details to smithereens. I had to adjust my
screen to watch it. I don't recall that on the old laserdisc or
anywhere else. It gets quite a bit lower 7/10 rating.
