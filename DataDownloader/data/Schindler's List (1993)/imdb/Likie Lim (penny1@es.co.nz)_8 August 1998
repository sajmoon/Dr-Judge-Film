Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List is a reflection on how great this
 director is. His 3-hour painting of Oskar Schindler and his forever
 changing view on the Nazi rampage against the innocent Jews is simply the
 greatest film achievement since the simple secret of Citizen Kane is
 finally revealed in a magnificent, grand and intelligent way. The final
 scene in which a marching group of 11,000 or so saved Jews morph into real
 survivors (an in color vision) and the ceremonial funeral of Oskar
 Schindler showing the several survivors of the Schindler factory is a real
 marvel and a sign that box office king Steven Spielberg doesn't work just
 for money.
Spielberg should be knighted or something for this movie, just like
 Schindler saved the Jews Spielberg let the Jews' pain and suffering be
 recognised and World War II be looked at beyond the view of the British and
 American army.
