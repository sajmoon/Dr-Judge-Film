I'm still learning about my Jewish history. And when I saw the movie it
touched a spot in my heart that seamed to be surrounded by a wall.
Schindler's List is a black and white movie to make you feel that it was
a
dark time in our world's history. There was only one time color was used
and
it was used to follow a small girl. I wonder how he really felt after the
war and the madness was over and he ran at the end of the movie. I'm
looking
into the historical fact of the movie as Hollywood tends to stretch the
truth at times. One part is true Oscar Schindler was announced a just and
righteous man and the tree planted in his name is still growing in
Israel.
