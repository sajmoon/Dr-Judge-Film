Oskar Schindler was a German Entrepreneur who came to Poland during the
Nazi occupation to start a new business. He wanted to hire Jewish labor
because they were cheaper than Polish. For a while, a good number of
Jews went to work in Schinder&#x27;s factories, making pots and pans for the
German economy. Eventually they were rounded up by Nazi Comander Amon
Goeth and put in the concentration camps. Those who were not fit to do
back- breaking slave labor were put in the gas chamber. Oscar Schinder,
who was in fact a Nazi supporter, slowly became empathetic after
watching the cruelty to these harmless people. Using all the money he
made from the business, he purchased 1,100 Jews from the Nazis, and put
them back to work in his factory, under good conditions until the war
was over. Not long after the war ended, Amon Goeth was executed for his
crimes against humanity, and Schindler unfortunately never ran a
successful business again, but today the descendants of the Jews he
saved number, tens of thousands.<br /><br />He has become a fairly controversial figure, but I personally think
that Oskar Schindler was great hero of the 20th Century, and this is
one of the greatest American films of all time; absolutely
heartbreaking, cinematically epic, and flawlessly acted. Many thanks to
both Schindler and Spielberg.
