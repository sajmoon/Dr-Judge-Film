Ok, the photography is really good (although I didn't like the color added
from time to time). Ok, this is a true story that should have been
filmed.<br /><br />But this is a too-american way of seeing the holocaust. Always had to be a
'happy end'.<br /><br />The horror the holocaust was is clearly visible on the film but I felt that
'we' were not to blame. It was 'their' fault ... Sorry can't believe
that.
