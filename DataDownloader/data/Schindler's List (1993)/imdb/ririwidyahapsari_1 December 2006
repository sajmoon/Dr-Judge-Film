I&#39;ve watched this movie million times, but still it always makes me
cry.. the way Spielberg described the life of Schindler makes me think
about the price of a human. ITS PRICELESS! I love the movie soundtrack
also, its totally genius, It blend perfectly with each scenes and my
favorite soundtrack in that movie is actually at the last scene, when
Jews people put the stones in Schindler&#39;s gravestone to honor him,
Ohhh....it totally makes me cry.. Love the movie,,,! Spielberg must put
all his heart on this.. Liam Neeson and John Williams are the best. If
anyone wants to see best drama of all time, i highly recommend this
movie..
