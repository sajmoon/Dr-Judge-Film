There are lots of callous acts by the Nazis catalogued in Spielberg's fine
account of the Holocaust, but I wasn't ready for the violence which -
obviously - goes hand in hand with that inhumanity. The poor woman sitting
alone in our screening jumped, yipping, every time someone got shot in front
of an unblinking camera. That's a big shock-count.<br /><br />Bravo Ben Kingsley and almost Liam Neeson, apart from the flatulence of the
breast-beating denouement at the liberation which made up my mind about the
otherwise well judged drip-feed of sentiment throughout. But personifying
the blind cruelty of the Nazi hierarchy - and stealing the show - is Ralph
Fiennes' beast Goeth. His absolute immersion in the irrational ideal spewed
out of Hitler's circle manifests itself casually, as if neither an order nor
a creed but simple bestial intuition. It turbo charged his career and
deservedly so.<br /><br />I prefer Polanski's The Pianist only for it's ground level, soap-operatic
engagement with the subject; Schindler's List is the film to show your
children to tell them what happened, why it was bad and that we should all
try to be heroes. 7/10
