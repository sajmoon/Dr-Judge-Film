Not the best movie ever, but it has got to be the most accurate, and heart
wrenching movies ever made.  If you don't cry, or feel horrible leaving this
movie, then you are not human.  This movie is a masterpiece, and anyone who
puts it down shouldn't be allowed to watch a movie ever again.  If you
haven't seen this movie, please, go out and do so.
