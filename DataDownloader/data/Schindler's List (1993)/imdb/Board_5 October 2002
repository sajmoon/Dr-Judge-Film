A fantastic movie from Steven Spielberg. I rarely use the word superb, but
superb isn't even enough for this movie! A true masterpiece, as I said in
my
summary. One of only two movies that I would give that grade (the other
being &quot;Breaking the waves&quot;). This comes in as the second best film I've
seen
my entire life! This movie isn't a brutal film like Spielberg's other WWII
movie &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (which also is superb in my opinion), but
deals
with concentration camps instead of the battlefields. One of only a few
emotional and moving movies I've seen - and one of the
best!!
