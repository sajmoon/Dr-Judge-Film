Well one this movie first came out I was just 6 years old. I didnt care
much
about movies. When I first saw it I was amazed at how well Steven
Spielberg
made this movie. Exallent acting, by Ralph Fiennes, Liam Neeson,
definentaly
in my top 5 list. Exellent score by John Williams. Music fit perfectly for
this movie. Hollywood couldnt get much better than this.
