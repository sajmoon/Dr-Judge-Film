I've seen Schindler's List 4 times. Each viewing convinces me more that
this
film should be a legal requirement for all teenagers to see in school, if
only to make them aware of man's inhumanity towards his fellow person.<br /><br />In this modern age, people feel it right to compare the Jews to the Nazis
over their treatment of the Palestinians. This film, if any, shows up
these
statements for the obnoxious canards that they are.
No nation can match the sheer brutality and calculated mechanisms devised
by
the Nazis. This movie shatters all illusions of the magnetism (to some) of
fascism. It shows how a political movement by people, in the modern age,
led
them to carry out the most horrendous and incomparable massacre in the
history of the world.<br /><br />The sad thing is that, despite the events of 1945, the world has not
changed. Maybe, just maybe, an effort to make viewing of this film
compulsory in the schools of the world, will educate the youth as to the
dangers of allowing anti-semitism to become the raison-d'etre of a
regime.
