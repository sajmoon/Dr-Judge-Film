Steven Spielberg has long been regarded as a director who can make a
lot of money. He has never been one of the greatest directors of all
time. Anyone who has actually seen one of his films will know why. <br /><br />It is true that ardent and powerful benefactors influence films. Or
rather directors adhering to the notion of financial, and not critical
success, like the idea of making a film that is mainstream. Financial
success pertains to certain cinematographic devices. Such devices can
be found throughout well-known and towering Hollywood films. In
Schindler&#x27;s List, it is easy to see Spielberg&#x27;s failed attempt at
creating a film that is supposed to have powerful meaning, and that is
supposed to break out of the mainstream of entertainment and escape. To
connect with people on an emotional and meaningful level it takes
Hollywood devices, explained earlier, that can be found throughout
Schindler&#x27;s List. A Jew is killed arbitrarily every minute or so, and
the repetitiveness and uncreative nature of this impedes. There is the
single villain character clich&#xE9; who we can attribute all the sorrow and
indecency in the film to. The real Holocaust was a tumultuous event,
caused by thousands of people working together simultaneously to make
the event a realization. <br /><br />The Jews are portrayed as tiny little animals. They are made to look as
pathetic and hopeless as possible. It is very silly, when a real and
serious event such as the Holocaust is changed into a stereotypical
mishmash of towering and terrifying Nazi leaders, laying waste to
thousands of small, weak, innocent Jews. A cartoon, characterized
portrayal of the Holocaust is not in need here. It is but a joke to
simplify the film for those who will pay money to see it, and make
Spielberg rich. After seeing the hundredth Jew killed the same way as
every other last one (without any new intriguing or surprising manner)
the killings and murders begin to seem fake. Fakeness surely would not
be good for those wishing there to be more tribute paid to the memory
of those who were persecuted in such an event. <br /><br />Spielberg may have brought down himself in such a respect, and does not
really pay respect to the 6 million Jews who died in the Holocaust. His
aspirations to make a realistic film about the Holocaust ironically
drown. This is ironic due to Spielberg&#x27;s Jewish identity, and
collaboration and applause from the Jewish community on such a film. <br /><br />It is of course true that it is not always easy, to make a film that is
realistic or creative of an event such as the Holocaust. There are no
real accounts to base the film on in a documentary-like kind of way, or
creative alternatives to be pursued instead in the making of the film.
It is obvious that the film was based on the basic known tenets about
the story of Oskar Schindler and the Holocaust, not elaborating into
any detailed accounts or descriptions of the events depicted. It is
easy to see how a film would end up unimaginative and uncreative, and
as overly simplified and straightforward as this film has. So many
people needed to cooperate and collaborate on making this single film.
But this can be overcome if the director is willing to take risks and
be as creative as possible. Spielberg can never be relied upon to do
so. <br /><br />It has already made sense to us a quarter of the way through the film
that Jews were arbitrarily persecuted even when displaying intrinsic
value, creative talent, and inventiveness sometimes in the Holocaust.
From then on, the rest of the film is a kind of &#x22;no duh&#x22; about this
arbitrariness that has already been made a point to us. It is so great
to have someone with a modern-day point of view such as Oskar
Schindler. For as we all know, all films need to have a stereotypical
hero come to the rescue to be actually worthwhile don&#x27;t they? Who ever
thought about instead pursuing a much more meaningful path. Holding a
dialogue on why Schindler is so different than everyone else at this
time would suffice. Was Schindler different for psychological or
biographical reasons perhaps? Why no, of course that would make the
film too complex and confusing right? <br /><br />What is even more simplified is that Ralph Fiennes terrifyingly
villainous character is in fact simply mentally insane. Never mind any
of the processions needed to be implicated as to why the Holocaust was
ever committed by a bunch of sane human beings. Those darn Nazis were
all coincidentally a bunch of chemically imbalanced people, who made up
a large fraction of the population of Germany at this time no? Thank
goodness Spielberg&#x27;s psychological reductionist worldview is far and
rare. <br /><br />The Holocaust was in fact a reflection of dense ideologies and
historical happenings within German Society at this time. Just in case
Spielberg is out there wondering why his film is not ambitious enough,
he now knows. There are some who will take care, to make it that the
Nazis were in fact ordinary men in a very different time than ours. I
personally would never rely on Spielberg to make me a complex,
creative, artistic film about the right amount of meaning, content, and
value. I would only rely on such a Hollywood errand-boy to make me some
good money. I could be rich and wealthy, and have unlimited resources
and privileges as Spielberg does.
