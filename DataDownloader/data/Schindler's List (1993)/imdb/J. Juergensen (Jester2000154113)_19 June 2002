Schindler's List both conveys the horrors of the Holocaust and depicts the
life of unlikely hero Oskar Schindler, a German businessman (and member of
the Nazi Party), who begins to sympathize with the Jews when he realizes
the
true scope of their suffering and ultimately saves 1100 of them from
Auschwitz.  Liam Neeson plays Schindler excellently, and Ralph Fiennes is
just as good as the vile Nazi Goeth.  With a movie that so graphically
(occasionally almost to an unwatchable extent) portrays the Holocaust and
the unspeakable crimes of the Nazis, it was nice that it had the character
of Herr Schindler to show that not all Germans were in support of this and
that some Germans went against the Nazis and saved lives, a fact that is
rarely mentioned in Holocaust films or anywhere else.  I'm not sure if
&quot;enjoyed&quot; is the right word, but I'm certainly glad I saw this important
piece of cinema.
