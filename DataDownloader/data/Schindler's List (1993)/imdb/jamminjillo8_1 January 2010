This movie is brilliant.<br /><br />Everything, EVERYTHING was portrayed so well. The settings, the
characters, the emotions were all so solid and spot on to the time
period.<br /><br />Spielberg did an excellent job in his take on the Holocaust and Poland
during World War II. The cinematography was more than amazing. I cannot
get over Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson&#x27;s performances in this movie.
Both of them won me over, I hated and loved them. They made their
characters so believable and REAL.<br /><br />It&#x27;s shocking how real everything was in this movie. It&#x27;s almost safe
to say that this is not a movie. Schindler&#x27;s List will capture you from
start to finish, and guaranteed, you will be changed at least a little
bit by the end of the film. Definitely one of the best.
