I have seen this film 12 times and every time I like it more. I like the
fact that Mr. Spielberg has done it in black and white. So the film seems
very authentical; more like a documentary film. Also the actors are great.
Especially Ben Kingsley's act of Stern is fantastic.<br /><br />But is not a movie that you can watch, relax and forget it. You have to
think about it for a long time and it can you make very sad. But otherwise
shows you the film that there is always a small hope. So it's an
optimistic
film as well.
