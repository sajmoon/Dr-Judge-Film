An absolutely brilliant rendering of life during the Holocaust; Steven
Spielberg's powerful direction shows you just what Hollywood is capable.
Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes give towering performances as the title
character and a frightening Nazi commandant, respectively and Ben Kingsley
is just as impressive in a quieter role. John Williams's wrenching score
and Janusz Kaminski's excellent photography complement the writing and
directing of this incomparable drama, in my opinion, the finest film ever
created. May Spielberg live in glory for showing the world what horror
lived behind those textbooks and what strength can emerge from that horror!
