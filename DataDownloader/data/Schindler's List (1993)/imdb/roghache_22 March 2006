Stephen Spielberg's amazing Schindler's List is an incredibly moving,
graphic depiction of Holocaust horrors, as they relate to one unlikely
humanitarian hero. The Czech born German businessman, Oskar Schindler,
starts up a factory in Poland, intending to make his fortune by taking
advantage of cheap Jewish labor. As he becomes increasingly aware of
the concentration camp horrors, his motivations change from profit to
helping his fellow man, and he is able to save 1100 Jews from the
atrocities and gas chambers of Auschwitz.<br /><br />Liam Neeson is brilliant in the role of the cool and very human Oscar
Schindler, an ordinary businessman not lacking in human frailties
himself. The only other actor that I specifically recall from the movie
is Ben Kingsley (who earlier played Gandhi), always wonderful in any
role.<br /><br />Just a trivial detail, but I found very touching the Jewish custom of
placing stones on the graves of loved ones. It is used with dramatic
effect in this movie. <br /><br />This is a superbly crafted film, the use at times of black and white
photography giving a starkly moving, documentary mood. The movie serves
as a dramatic tribute to one ordinary and obviously flawed man who,
through good will, smarts, and audacity, was able to save so many
lives. It is also a troubling personal depiction of the Holocaust,
brought to horrific life to many viewers because of Spielberg's
efforts. However, it is NOT of course, by any means, an entertaining
film. I have not seen it since its original release and find it too
disturbing to deliberately set forth to watch a second time.<br /><br />Although some reviewers have criticized the insensitivity and false
portrait, I'd also recommend the Italian film, Life is Beautiful, for a
different and unusual view of concentration camps, a story filled with
love, humor, and optimism. Also, although I believe there was in years
past a TV movie of some sort (starring Richard Chamberlain?), I'd like
to see a major film done on another Holocaust hero, Raoul Wallenberg, a
Swedish diplomat who saved countless Hungarian Jews. I put Wallenberg
in a similar heroic category along with Oskar Schindler.<br /><br />Schindler's List is a must see movie, both disturbing history and
extraordinary heroism brought dramatically to life on the screen.
