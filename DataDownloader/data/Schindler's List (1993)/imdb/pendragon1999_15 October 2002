Before Private Ryan Speilberg proved just how much of an artist he is.
Taking this project to levels no one else could have ever dreamed of. So
many haunting images in this film, the one that still gets me is of the
ghetto cleansing where you see the little girl, running and the only color
on the screen is her red jacket. Later as the camera pans by the piles of
bodies to be burned, off in the corner but still very frightening is the
same red jacket. I shivered in the theatre, and every time I see this it
still shocks me. Beautiful film, haunting image. Thank you Mr.
Spielberg.
