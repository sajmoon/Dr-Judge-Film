I think this is absolutely a great movie! There are definitely things in
this movie that are
not good to see.  I think that this is probably one of the most
informational movies of all
time.  The sad part about it is that Oskar Shindler really did help the
Jews, but only for
his own personal gain.  The German leaders knew this, but the tiny number
of
Jews that
he saved did not constitute an emergency on their part.  Good
movie!
