What else can be said about this masterpiece by Steven Speilberg about Oskar
Schindler who did anything he could - including bribery - to employ jewish
workers in his munition plants which resulted in saving over one thousand
jews from the nazi slaughter. In a way it is troubling to say this movie is
great and is a favorite because of the terrific horror of the subject but
Speilberg makes it a poignant memorial for those who lived through the
holocaust and a reminder to those who were too young to have remembered that
these atrocities did happen and such hatred should never present itself
again.
