Watching this movie made me absolutely furious...why didn&#x27;t anyone have
the balls to stand up to these Nazi criminals?!!! Why didn&#x27;t we bomb
Aushwitz? Why didn&#x27;t we stop these arrogant losers? I have nightmares
about this stuff...the ghettos, the gas chambers, the skeletons...all
of it. I just don&#x27;t know how an entire intelligent nation could let
this happen...Hitler was a blowhard who couldn&#x27;t even hold a steady
thought during his disgusting, burping tirades. My God, the minute this
idiot starting spouting any kind of prejudiced hatred nonsense he
should have been carted away. What kind of leader talks like this? ...I
don&#x27;t care how bad the unemployment was or how bad the economy was, or
how hungry the people of Germany were. Total BS and just another excuse
for hatred of another human being. Aryan blood and ethnic cleansing..?
Good Lord, it sounds like something from a science fiction movie. What
an insane point in human history it was for this to have happened.
Makes me ill that this happened on our beautiful planet...humans can be
so very evil at times. Anyway, this movie is very realistic and will
generate an emotional response.
