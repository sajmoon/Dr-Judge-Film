One thing about this movie my friend commented upon was the way that
emotionally effects are used within this picture. An emotional prop would be
the little girl in the red dress, was it there to create emotions through
grimmicks? There are other things like that throughout. Otherwise I thought
the acting was superb with some character developments. However was this
film accurate historically. My friend thinks it was not and was actually a
very good form of subtle emotional propaganda!
What do you think? 
I know the director's last work on 'Saving Private Ryan'(SPR) was a piece of
American trash only showing how GI's saved Europe - that's manipulating the
public and historical narratives, with all this American flag waving rubbish
(The Straight Story (1999) tells you more about world War Two than the whole
three hours of SPR could ever do!!!). Can the same be true of Schindler's
List?
