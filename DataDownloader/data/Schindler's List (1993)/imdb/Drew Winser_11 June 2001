A beautifully crafted film which seems somewhat hollow at the center (as is
true of many of Spielberg's films).  Though many have hailed &quot;List&quot; as
being
a great film, I felt that it soft-pedaled the horrors of the Holocaust.
Kudos to actor Ralph Fiennes and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski,
however...
