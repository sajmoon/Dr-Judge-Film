This is a brilliant film that presents the holocaust and its evil
horrors in an epic way that reaches into the viewers hearts and perhaps
allows the viewer to empathise with the Jewish Victims.<br /><br />I myself am a Jew and seeing as my ancestors were in the holocaust, i
am more emotionally attached to the movie then some other people. This
is a film you need to see before you die and you will never truly
understand the holocaust until you see this film The acting is near
enough perfect, the direction is perfect.<br /><br />The poetic image of the girl in the red dress is heart wrenchingly
emotional and it presents how much every single one of the Jews
suffered in the holocaust.<br /><br />The only problem i have with the movie is that it took a small while to
get started and the text at the end is hard to read.<br /><br />In Conclusion, this is a film everyone on the earth should see. Its one
of the greatest films of all time. Enjoy!
