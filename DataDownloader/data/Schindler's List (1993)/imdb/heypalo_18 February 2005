I'm a big fan of Spielberg and i have to admit that Schlinders List is
he's greatest and best ever made movie. Even with movies like JAWS,
Saving Private Ryan, Jurrasic Park, E.T they don't have the same class
as Schlinders list. The movie is made in white n black and not many
movies are made so now days and that he had the courage to do it and
manage to win a Oscar. The movie makes you really think back to the
past with the black n white and the places that he's been filming that
makes our minds go flash back to the old good times. Yet there are some
mistakes as the most of the directors and actors make. He makes this
movie to much.. if you understand he makes it the Spielberg way that
means that he loves the action scenes but he hasn't been using it as he
did in Saving Private Ryan.. He makes the action go good with the
picture &quot;the piano scene (Ghetto) &quot; ...<br /><br />Johan &quot;SWEden&quot;
