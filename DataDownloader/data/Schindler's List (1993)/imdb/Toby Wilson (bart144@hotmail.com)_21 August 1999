oh dear, spielberg really should stick to his normal forte of brainless
hollywood epics because he is WAY out of his depth here.<br /><br />I didn't hold out much hope for this one despite all the ridiculously
overblown praise. Its amazing how one can go from being the epitome of
film-making mediocrity to genius just by choosing the holocaust as your
theme!<br /><br />This film is not a tribute to those that died it is an insult, it reduces
their suffering to the level of Indiana Jones and Jurassic Park. I'm
surprised he resisted the temptation to stick a dinosaur in
it.<br /><br />But he is, as always, laughing all the way to the bank! This should get 0
out of 10 but unfortunately i'll have to award it a 1.
