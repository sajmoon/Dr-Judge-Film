I almost dare not &quot;review&quot; or &quot;comment&quot; on this film. However, I  will,
because this is a film everyone should see. It is dramatic, emotional and
noble, and handles the most difficult subject of the 20th century without
giving a sermon.<br /><br />Schindler's List is clearly Speilberg's best - the best he will ever do -
and is one the great films of all time. It is an experience, not just a
movie. Those who hate it or dislike it, I challenge you to watch it again
and question your feelings. Did it disturb you? Did it frighten you? I think
that it is near impossible to dislike this movie - only to be bothered by
it.<br /><br />The fact is that this film deals in truth. It graphically portrays a dark,
dark chapter in human history, and provides deep insight into the role
hatred played in WWII. This is a movie that will make you question the world
we live in and make you feel sorry to be a part of the species that let this
happen.<br /><br />Note also, that there is no great sermon on why genocide is wrong or why the
Nazis must be stopped. Schindler's heart is opened by what he sees and
experiences - no-one needs to tell him that killing is
wrong.<br /><br />Pretty bleak, but pretty accurate. But under the thematic elements is a
great film. Extraordinary acting, especially Ralph Fiennes as the psychotic
Amon Goeth. Janusz Kaminky's cinematography is amongst the best ever
seen.<br /><br />Without spoiling, I can say that this is the singularly most horrifying
movie I have ever seen. It disturbed me for days. I recommend this movie to
everyone. It will entertain you, but also educate you, but mostly, it is an
important film that will make you examine your own life. As dark as it is,
this is a movie of hope and survival. **** out of ****.
