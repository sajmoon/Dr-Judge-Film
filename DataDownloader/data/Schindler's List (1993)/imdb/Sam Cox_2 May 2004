well I have only just seen this film recently due to the new DVD. I was in
a
way reluctant to watch it as so many people have said how sad it is and
the
fact that it is in black and white doesnt really appeal to
me.
But once I sat myself down and switched it on I was very suddenly
intrigued
by the amount of detail and hard work put into this film. Liam Neeson and
Ben Kinglsey are the 2 main stars of this film and carry it very well
whereas Ralph Feinnes delivers a shocking and scary performance. it
pleased me to see his come-upance at the end.<br /><br />I have to say that I have never cried during a film, never in my life. But
towards the end of this film there was a lump in my throat and its true to
say that i wasnt choaking on pop-corn.
If a film is based on a point in history and is being made by a very
talented director and has the certificate of a 15 or an 18 then it has no
boundaries and this film is one of them. This is how this film carries
itself into my top 10 list. It shows how horrifically the Jews were
treated
and how it turned into 2 mens struggle to save as many as they possibly
could. The end where all the victims of the Nazi's ways placed a stone on
Oscar Schindler's grave is extrememly touching and is a perfect end to an
excellent film. Too bad Speilberg doesnt make films like this these
days...now we're given A.I and Minority Report...such a
shame
