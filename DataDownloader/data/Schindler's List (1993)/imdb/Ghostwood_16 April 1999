Well, after six years of good intentions, I finally got around to seeing
Schindler's List. I was warned that it was sad, it was harrowing, it was
this, it was that. Maybe it had been so hyped up, my expectations were just
too great. The acting was great - Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph
Fiennes were superb.<br /><br />I couldn't help thinking that the whole thing about the Holocaust was
trivialised, though. The scene where the viewer assumes that the women were
to be executed turns out to be a harmless shower - just as you're pulled in
to think you're seeing the real thing, Spielberg turns on the schmaltz
again. The same happens at the end where Schindler breaks down in tears,
thinking he could have saved more Jews -  it was so out of character
compared to the rest of the film.<br /><br />Nonetheless, a watchable film, if a wee bit too long. 6/10
