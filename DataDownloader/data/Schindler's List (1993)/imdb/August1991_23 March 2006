Given the number of comments here, it is probably superfluous to add my
opinion. Nevertheless, I will - to express my three points. First, this
film is a masterpiece both in its content and in its style.
Notwithstanding &quot;Sophie's Choice&quot; and other attempts to recount the
Holocaust, the story of Schindler needed to be told. I am pleased that
Spielberg told it and not, for example, Polanski or Scorcese. Spielberg
(in some ways a Schindler himself, a guy with panache) relied on image,
and feeling. (The most powerful scenes need no sound. Dialogue is often
in Polish, German or Yiddish.) Spielberg tells Schindler's story
without a Polanski edge, nor a Scorcese wantonness.<br /><br />Second, the choice of the pre-war Hungarian song &quot;Gloomy Sunday&quot; lent
authenticity as I watched, and has given me a reminder since. I can't
hear other versions of this song now without thinking of this story.<br /><br />Third, watch for the girl's red dress because that's when Schindler
realizes a truth, and somehow changes. At the end, watch for the woman
spontaneously touch Schindler's grave with her hand. In all this
terribleness, something good survived.
