This is almost certainly the finest film I have seen to date, with Saving
Private Ryan, another Spielberg film coming a fairly close second.
Everything about this film is designed to try and raise awareness of actual
events in their gruesome detail.
Spielberg should be credited for using moderation to get the message
across.
There are scenes of violence, but overall the film is all the more
effective
for the implication of what is to come.
Fiennes is chilling as the camp commandant, doubly so when you realise that
this was an actual person who actually did the things shown, and all this
less than a lifetime ago.
Cinematography was superb throughout, and the brave decision to shoot in
black and white adds to the authentic feel of the film.
The final scenes are particularly emotional, and many people in the cinema
were crying at the end.
This film should be required viewing for any holocaust denier types, or
just
to those who have no concept of how evil men can be to their fellow man.
Many people in Germany were left shocked after watching
this
film, because it's not the sort of thing that is discussed in depth over
there (according to my German friend). 10/10
