Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes star in Spielberg's
award-winning Holocaust drama <br /><br />Author Thomas Keneally won a Booker Prize for 'Schindler's Ark', but it took
Spielberg to tell the story of shady Nazi industrialist Schindler who saved
hundreds of Jews from the death camps to a worldwide audience.<br /><br />It was very much a personal project for Spielberg. After the success of
Jurassic Park he was able to make any film he wanted, and has said that he
didn't expect many people would want to see a Jewish story. However, in
Neeson's flawed hero Oskar Schindler, Kingsley's quietly desperate Jewish
administrator Itzhak Stern and Fiennes's bloatedly evil concentration camp
commandant Amon Goeth, Spielberg had a dramatic engine that pulls an
audience along through the heartbreaking story of the enslavement and
massacre of Poland's Jews. <br /><br />It won buckets of Oscars, but its best tribute is the shocked, tearful
silence of audiences everywhere. An outstanding, harrowing piece of cinema.<br /><br />Verdict
A heart-rending and redemptive Holocaust story, this Oscar-grabbing epic
added to Spielberg's directorial credibility, showing he could handle
controversial, sophisticated stories with real sensitivity.
