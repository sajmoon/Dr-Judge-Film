Put your preconceptions about the director aside.  Clear your mind of
Hollywood prototypes and what could and should be added to this film.
Just
enjoy this masterpiece as a thematic work of art in which the acting is
superb, the time period represented is real, and the story is a blend of
sorrow, shame, and awe.  This is the only movie that overcame my emotions,
resulting in tears.  It will leave you spellbound with its haunting
soundtrack and black and white canvass.  This movie is truly a masterpiece
of filmmaking, and whether or not you liked it, it should be respected.  I
voted 10/10.
