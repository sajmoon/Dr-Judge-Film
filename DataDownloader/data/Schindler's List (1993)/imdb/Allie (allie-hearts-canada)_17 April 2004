I've researched the holocaust greatly, and have watched numerous movies
about the Holocaust. Schindler's List has to be the best movie I've seen
on
the topic. The frank presentation of the violence and indifference of the
nazi officers is amazing. Perhaps the most intense scene is when the
Schindler's Female workers are sent to Auschwitz instead of his camp. The
presentation, music, and cinematography make it one of the best scenes in
any movie I have seen. All of the acting is fantastic, but I find Ralph
Fiennes' portrayal of Nazi Camp commandant Amon Goeth stunning. Also well
acted is Embeth Davidtz in the role of Helena Hirsch, the jewish made of
Goeth. He shows both the evil and human sides of the man, and acts them
incredibly well. The cinematography is wonderful. Overall, this is a must
see movie for all people interested in history.
