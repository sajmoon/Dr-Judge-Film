A film that is not overrated in the least. Speilberg has been accused of
trying to manipulate the audience, somehow I don't think he is. This is
truly genuine filmmaking. Spielberg wanted to make this movie very much and
his passion is all let out in this remarkable film. Once again, a film that
is only torn down because people need to try finding something wrong with
any movie that wins a lot of awards and receives a lot of positive
attention. Spielberg's mastery comes into the liquidation scenes; amazing.
Great editing on the part of Kahn too.
