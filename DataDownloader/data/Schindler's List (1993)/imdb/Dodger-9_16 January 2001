In the same week that ET opened in America, Steven Spielberg read Thomas
Keneally's Schindler's Ark, the book based on the true story of one man who
rescued more than 1,000 Jews from under the noses of the Nazis.<br /><br />Intrigued by the subject, the film rights were snapped up and the result was
the most talked about movie of the Nineties.<br /><br />Schindler's List rarely fails to stir the emotions. As with all of the cast
- especially Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes - Liam Neeson gives the
performance of a lifetime as the suave businessman Oskar Schindler, spurred
on by the brief that as many people as possible should see the movie - and
not just from a commercial point of view, as Neeson recalled at the time of
release.<br /><br />`I remember Steven saying &#145;Don't take this wrong, but I want everyone in the
world to see this film,' and I knew exactly what he meant.'<br /><br />It goes without saying that the Holocaust was such an horrific event that
any director would have to feel mature enough to tell their story without
letting sentiment get in the way. <br /><br />So, 10 years after he first read the book, the master movie-maker was ready
to tackle the most important film of his career.<br /><br />He had a self-confessed reluctance to confront the Holocaust and his own
Jewishness as a subject. <br /><br />Following his more &#145;human' dramas such as The Color Purple and Empire of the
Sun, the project was still very much in his mind, but his own involvement
would be purely on a production level. <br /><br />After offering it to fellow film directors Martin Scorsese and Sydney
Pollack, they both turned it down and Hollywood's favourite son was left to
condense the novel into a three-hour black and white movie.<br /><br />Having successfully fleshed out many of his childhood fantasies and with
events in the Balkans at the time mirroring those of fifty years earlier,
1993 was exactly the right time to address the matter.<br /><br />So keen was Spielberg to make the film, he left the Hawaiian set of Jurassic
Park before the film's completion and flew to Poland to start
filming.<br /><br />Old friend George Lucas was left to edit the dinosaur blockbuster while
Steven watched the footage on descrambled satellite transmissions.<br /><br />Both films went on to achieve widespread acclaim, for different
reasons.
If JP was the sort of a movie an overexcited child would make, then SL was
that of a seasoned film-maker at ease with his craft and intent on
delivering something extremely adult.<br /><br />Schindler's List received 12 Oscar nominations, including the elusive Best
Director gong which Steven eventually picked up from an Academy that had
ignored many of his movies on the grounds that he had been rewarded
enough.<br /><br />Tackling a drama in which six million people ended up dead was not for the
novice film-maker - It was for the brave of heart and a director that could
tell such a stark tale without alienating his audience from the
outset.<br /><br />Indeed, only Claude Lanzmann had delivered anything that came close with his
epic film Shoah, a nine and a half hour documentary about the Holocaust
which wowed the critics in 1985.<br /><br />For his movie, Spielberg was blessed with a polished screenplay by Steve
Zaillian, a young writer who went on to direct his own movies such as the
John Travolta vehicle, A Civil Action, and who has just spruced up the
dialogue for Silence of the Lambs sequel, Hannibal.<br /><br />Needless to say, this not the sort of movie you curl up with on a Saturday
night with a box of chocs and a six pack. It's a harrowing film which has
lost none of its power either on the small screen or in the eight years
since its release.
