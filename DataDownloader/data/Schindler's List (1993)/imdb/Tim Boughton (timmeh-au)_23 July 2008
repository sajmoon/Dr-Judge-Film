I&#39;m a man of few words and rarely comment on movies or leave reviews,
however, after seeing this film, I had no choice but to. This film,
although quite long, will keep you glued from start to finish. Steven
Spielberg&#39;s directing efforts are remarkable and will have you in an
array of emotions in showing the horror&#39;s of the Holocaust. The acting,
music and costumes from all involved are second to none, and go hand in
hand with the spectacular settings.<br /><br />Don&#39;t miss this epic. Do yourself a favour and hire, buy or steal to
see this one, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />10/10.
