I don't know what to say about this movie. I had never seen it, so when
I received it this spring I was eager to watch it. I find the subject
of the Holocaust to be fascinating (not in a good way) because it's
just astounding that this actually happened. It baffles the mind how
this could occur on such a grand scale. I'm always watching shows on
the history channel about WWII and the Holocaust and so I had very high
expectations for this movie. So, I put it in my DVD player and sat down
to watch a movie about a subject that I have a lot of interest in.
Three hours later I felt as if every ounce of life had been sucked from
my body. I was bored to death. I could never get emotionally attached
to anyone in the movie. I know this sounds bad but I never felt sorry
for anyone in this film. This film felt like it had no real vision or
direction and it never bothered to develop any characters; everyone in
the movie came across as wooden figures to me.<br /><br />Now comes the real question; should a person watch a movie about the
Holocaust expecting to be entertained? Well, the answer to this
question is both yes and no. You shouldn't be entertained because it
covers such a dark subject but anyone who enjoys history could be
entertained because it covers significant event in human history. This
where the film fails. It covers the event but it doesn't attempt to
make the movie interesting, Spielberg must of decided that the subject
matter alone was interesting enough and left it at that.<br /><br />I can watch a show about the Holocaust on the history channel and I
will be more emotionally attached to the people in that one hour show
than I will be to anyone in that three hour boring film, Schlinder's
List. I'm sorry but that's poor execution on Spielberg's part.
