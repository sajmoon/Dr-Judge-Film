Both of my entire families were killed by the Nazis. My mother who is
now 88 years old is still alive. She saw her entire family murdered.
This film is my roots. It shows just a taste of the reality that was
the Holocaust. Mr. Spielberg applied his immense talents in this
masterpiece and recognized his Jewish heritage, after establishing
himself with other nice movies, but none of this importance. My mother
was interviewed for the foundation he created after making this film.
Her story has been documented along with many other in his Shoah
project. This is a difficult movie for me to watch, but an essential
one, for it is my heritage, my roots. I thank Mr. Spielberg for making
it.
