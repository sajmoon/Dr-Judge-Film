This film, along with Amistad and perhaps a few others, show that
Steven Spielberg is not just a cutesy, non-brutal, gentle director as
some of his films make him out to be. This film is not clich&eacute; or
heartwarming. The truth is that if you are going to make a film about
something as horrifying and terrible as The Holocaust, you have to be
brutal. And Spielberg was necessarily brutal. What&#39;s depicted in this
film is extremely upsetting, and I wish not go into detail fear I upset
myself and furthermore upset you. It&#39;s not gory or bloody like a war
film, (although there are some scenes that boarder on gory), but
rather, as you may have guessed, emotionally brutal. I am not a Jewish
individual, but I can honestly say, just as a human being, this film
upsets me. Schindler&#39;s List is extremely well made, with excellent
performances, and shot in black and white which I felt set the bitter,
old tone.<br /><br />This is not for the faint of heart, but certainly a very essential,
moving film.<br /><br />One a final note, a praise Spielberg for two things. One would be for
making this film for absolutely no money, and also for not turning it
into a &quot;German hate&quot; movie.
