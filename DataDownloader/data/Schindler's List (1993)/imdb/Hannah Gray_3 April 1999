It is a rare occasion for me to cry during a movie. However this movie
moved me to tears. I believe everyone in the world should see this film.
Liam Neeson does a wonderful job in the portrayal of Oskar Schindler.
Ralph
Fiennes does an excellent job as the Nazi Amon Goeth which he has said is
one of his toughest roles because of the complexity of the character. One
of
the scenes that stays with me is the one with the little girl in the
scarlet
clothes walking down the street in the middle of a Nazi Aktion. It really
shows you that these horrors must not be forgotten. There are many people
who deny the Holocaust or just don't care. I believe that we should try
our
best to keep these memories alive if we are to have hope for the future.
That is what this film does thank you Steven Spielberg.
