My all time favorite movie, one of Spielberg's finest. A masterpiece. This
is a movie about a little known hero who saved thousands of Jews during
the
Holocaust by letting them go to work in his factory. The movie starts with
a
small color scene with a Jewish family chanting in Hebrew, and the rest of
the movie is in black and white. Liam Neeson plays the main character,
Oskar
Schindler. He does quite well for such a dramatic role. The story is
meaningful and touching, and of course based on real events, which gives
it
an amount of depth that other movies just can't equal. The sheer
seriousness
of the movie leaves many who see the movie slightly altered. You cannot
watch this movie without it changing your life, in at least some way,
however small a way it may be. Winner of the 1993 Best Picture Academy
Award, and it really, really deserves it.
