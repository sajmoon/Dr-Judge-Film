No doubt is this the best movie ever made. It&#39;s a unforgettable movie.
It&#39;s a strong and demanding movie, but every second is pure art. It
takes you three hours in history and hell. Liam Neeson is perfect as
Oskar Schindler.Ralph Fiennes is amazing as the nazi-psycho Amon Goeth.
He shows authority and is very frightening. Ben Kingsley is also great
but his performance is in the shadow of Neeson&#39;s and Fiennes&#39;.<br /><br />This is the most dramatic movie ever, and is a movie that everybody
should watch, either they want to or not. It&#39;s a important movie which
reminds everyone on this tragic thing. <br /><br />10/10
