I don't know why, but I've never seen this film before. Despite all the
awards and buzz, I was just never moved to rent it.  On one hand, I'm
kicking myself for not having watched it years ago. On the other, I think
this is a perfect time to watch it.  With everything going on in the world
today, I think it would serve every one of us well to watch this ... and
be
reminded of how the US stood by, knowing full well what was happening as
Hitler marched across Europe, and did NOTHING.  My wife and I were very
moved throughout the film. If you have one ounce of compassion in you,
this
movie will bring it to the surface!
