Excellent film, and probably the best movie made in the 1990s. Schindler's
List is a somewhat long film and definitely not something for small children
to see, but it is an intense story that will still be relevant 100 years
from now. Filmed in black and white (an effective idea by Spielberg), the
Holocaust is show in unsanitized form, and you do not forget the images once
you see them. Instead of just showing footage of the camp, Spielberg digs
deeply into the minds and psyche of both the prisoners and the Nazis and we
learn what their motivations and hopes are. By looking deeply at the Nazis,
they come across as complex individuals and not just faceless monsters,
something that had not been explored previously in other films about the
Holocaust; they are still portrayed as incredibly evil as they were in
history, but Spielberg does a good job of explaining their psychology to us,
which adds to the understanding of the Holocaust. Not a pleasant film to
watch at all, but a movie that must be seen.
