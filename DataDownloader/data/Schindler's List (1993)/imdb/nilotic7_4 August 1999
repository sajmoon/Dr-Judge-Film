that's the only word for it, astounding.  the parts were excellently
portrayed, liam neeson's oskar schindler was amazing and yes, i am a FAN!
ralph fiennes was wonderful...i pardon you..that was a beautiful scene.
ben
kingsley was so believable in his role as itzak stern.  steven spielberg
has
created something more than a masterpiece and john williams musical score
is
delicious, itzhak perlman makes you feel the music as he is a genius with
the violin.  if you haven't seen it, please do, it will captivate you,
obsess you, and make you make your friends watch it with you.  a ten out
of
ten doesn't begin to describe it. and having family involved in the nazi
massacre, it really brings it all into perspective.  i love
it.
