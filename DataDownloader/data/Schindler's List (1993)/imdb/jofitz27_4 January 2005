Last night, after reading many fabulous reviews, I was lucky enough to
view Schindlers list, a supposed &quot;masterpiece&quot; directed by the famous,
the fabulous, Steven Spielberg, creating masterpieces such as E.T. and
Jurassic park. So I went into this 3 hour epic with high hopes.<br /><br />It starts off rather depressingly, but picks up. Directed beautifully
in black and white, to give it a more old fashioned sense, it clearly
shows the films class. Schindler's slimy personality is soon introduced
(we see he has affairs with more that one women) and cannot promise his
estranged wife she is the only one he will truly ever feel for. Then,
we are introduced to Ralph Fiennes (Goeth) a rather brutal member of
the Nazi party. So both of the characters &quot;politically incorrect&quot;
frames are introduced.<br /><br />The film is simply too long for me to comment on every happening, but
it becomes blatantly apparent that this film didn't win 7 academy
awards for nothing. Both hopeful and poignant (showing some rather
graphic violent scenes as well) this truly is a masterpiece that should
be viewed by all.<br /><br />Final summary: ***** out of ***** (5 out of 5)
