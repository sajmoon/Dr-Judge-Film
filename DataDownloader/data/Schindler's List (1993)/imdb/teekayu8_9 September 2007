...and I mean what I said. Some movies just don&#39;t stick to you. As soon
as your head touches the soft couch, you forget all about that great,
magnificent movie you just saw. But this is something else. It&#39;s the
kind of movie that stays with you no matter where what. The kind of
drama and horror you can&#39;t shake off easily. How honest the story is
accompanied by visual black and white footage add to some of the rare
elements normally found in everyday&#39;s film. You could still review it
all right in your mind. This re-telling of some of the very majestic
last moments of World War 2 is well done. But once again, what do you
expect from Spielberg? We all know he is good. But this is something
else. It is WAY BEYOND.<br /><br />Awesome WW2 movie I&#39;ve ever seen since The Longest Day and The Pianist.
20 out of 10 is what this film deserve.
