I watched this movie in my socials class to see what WW2 was like and I
thought that it was a fantastic film. It really opened my eyes. It made me
want to see it over and over again. The movie really shocked me on how
some
of the Jewish people were treated. I think that this was a great learning
tool to see what it was actually like.
