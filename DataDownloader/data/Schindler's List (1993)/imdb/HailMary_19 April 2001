as i am writing this, i have just finished viewing this film on the public
broadcasting system, and was amazed at how it showed the pure agony of war
and the struggle of survival.  this is hard to show, espcially to a person
of my generation, one of disaffected youth.  this film was full of pure,
human emotion that has a great moral lesson.  it really puts the power of
the motion picture into full prespective and the way films like &quot;dude,
what's my line?&quot;, or whatever, are a true waste of film.  i'm daniel
