To me this is why movies exist.  This is my favorite movie of all time.
It
does not matter what your background is, the story that was told and the
way
in which it was portrayed moved me more than I ever thought I could be
moved.  Spielberg directed his best film and I would recommend every
person
to watch this movie.
