Here is Barbara's List of all the reasons why Schindler's List is the most
annoyingly overpraised film of all time.
1.Overlong
2.Spielberg's most self-indulgent film, which is pretty pathetic,
considering that he also made Saving Private Ryan
3.self-consciously arty
4.overabundance of cheesy filmmaking gimmicks.<br /><br />If I had more time, I could go on forever....
