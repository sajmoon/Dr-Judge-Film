What can I say about this movie that haven&#39;t been told....<br /><br />Its an incredible strong movie, that tells a strong tale of war, human
nature, incredible cruelty and bravery.<br /><br />Its a movie against all the evils of war, and the depths man will sink
down to. <br /><br />It most likely have some historical flaws, and maybe something has been
forgotten, or &quot;hollywoodized&quot;, but its still such a strong tale that
these flaws can be forgiven without any troubles.<br /><br />Today its a movie everyone should see, maybe more than ever. This
movie, along with a couple of other should be mandatory in our schools,
just so that our kids, and the future generations never forget the
atrocities that was done to the Jews, gay people, Gypsies, blacks etc
during that war.<br /><br />Ken Roger Lindekleiv Kristiansand Norway
