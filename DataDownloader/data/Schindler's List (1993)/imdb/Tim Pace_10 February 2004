No not the subject, we all know the story. This film to me and I stress
&quot;To
Me&quot; is perfect. I cannot watch it without crying. Crying with envy of the
ability of the man. The sheer filmaking skill of this movie leavs me
breathless. I could ramble on for hours and often do about this film. One
day I hope I live long enough and I am lucky enough to meet SS in person.
Just to thank him for the pleasure this movie has given me.
