I cried cried and am typing this with tears not fully dry. How is it
possible for man to feel such contradictory emotions.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg tribute to the JEWS through this film is immeasurable.
Not only does it make us understand the historical perspective of the
War, it gives us a glimpse of Human cruelty towards his fellow men.<br /><br />The movie achieves what it is meant for- the question of &quot;why War?&quot;,
questions to pounder around.<br /><br />Schindler saved the most important commodity on earth- Lives. War is
cruel, it brings evil but it also raised a Hero, a flower in the midst
of thorns.<br /><br />Emotional and heart rending...<br /><br />The stone kept on Schindler grave by the surviving Schindler Jews
(before the closing of the movie)was simply the most realistic touching
emotional translation of cinema to reality...
