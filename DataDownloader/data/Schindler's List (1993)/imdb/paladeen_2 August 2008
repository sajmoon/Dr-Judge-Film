Schindler&#39;s List is one of the most overrated films of all time: It won
seven Oscars. It is the 6th highest rated film on IMDb. The critics
loved it, and the Internet is flooded with reviews where people rave
about being &quot;deeply moved&quot; or &quot;touched.&quot;<br /><br />Ultimately, the film is a shallow failure.<br /><br />A good drama film needs several qualities. Of these, the most important
is the exposition of characters and their interactions. Schindler&#39;s
List flops spectacularly in this respect. We start out following the
tale of Oskar Schindler, an opportunistic, profiteering businessman.
But midpoint in the film, this Schindler persona has disappeared, and
we have a new character clothed in the same flesh -- a self-sacrificing
philanthropist who spends his entire amassed fortune to save the Jew
workers. How did we get from one to the other? How did Schindler
transform from the evil Mr. Hyde to the benevolent Dr. Jekyll? Steven
Spielberg certainly doesn&#39;t show us -- maybe it happens via magic, like
the bicycle ride in ET?<br /><br />And what about Amon G&ouml;th, the representative Nazi? A &quot;grotesque
caricature&quot; if there ever was one. He&#39;s an evil, sadistic, Jew-hating
Nazi bastard -- but do we get to know why he wakes up every morning,
takes a swig of booze and snipes Jew prisoners for fun? No. Spielberg
thinks the answer is obvious -- he&#39;s a Nazi, and Nazis don&#39;t have
reasons for the things they do. They&#39;re just rabid dogs out for blood,
utterly devoid of any moral dimension. But this sort of shallow
political correctness can&#39;t possibly cut any slack with intelligent
viewers. We want to know why G&ouml;th hates the Jews so much that he fires
his pistol into a pile of decimated corpses, but we never get to know.
Apparently, he does it because he&#39;s an Evil Nazi, and that&#39;s all there
is to it.<br /><br />The attempt to add depth to G&ouml;th&#39;s character by dwelling on his twisted
love affair with a Jewish girl is easily seen for what it is -- a cheap
exposure of Nazi hypocrisy. How about trying to dwell on real issues
here, Spielberg? How about trying to pass these people off as genuine
(albeit twisted) human beings?<br /><br />This shortcoming is not restricted to Spielberg. When will Hollywood
own up to the fact that the men who ran the Third Reich were not
mindless monsters? Some of them were cultivated intellectuals and
scientists, others compassionate family men and devoted friends.
Germany was the best educated country in Europe when the Nazis rose to
power. The true intrigue of the Holocaust does not lie in the
brutality, but rather in Hannah Arendt&#39;s &quot;banality of evil&quot;. How can a
man (or millions of men) arbitrarily narrow the moral sphere to exclude
people seemingly no different from neighbours, friends and family? How
can a man fall under the sway of a dispassionate and cruel ideology
while leading a normal life of compassion?<br /><br />Needless to say, none of these issues are explored by Spielberg.<br /><br />Another peeve of mine: Accents. There are English-speaking films and
then there are German-speaking films. Schindler&#39;s List, on the other
hand, does not belong to either of these categories. Instead, Spielberg
opted to have the characters speak English with a German accent. What
the hell? Listening to Liam Neeson strut about trying to sound like an
Anglicised German is just pathetic. : Spielberg&#39;s trying to please
Hollywood audiences by making the film accessible to them (and hence,
no spoken German), but for the love of God! We get the point! They&#39;re
in Nazi Germany. Yes, Hitler&#39;s in charge. Yes, it&#39;s a nasty, genocidal
regime. Please, no cheesy accents.<br /><br />One of the truly unforgivable aspects of the film is the ending. A
mildly touching speech by Schindler about being a war criminal on the
run, wanted by the victors of the war, set just the right mood. It
would have been perfect. But no, Spielberg couldn&#39;t resist messing it
up -- he had to have Schindler break down, bawl and cry, grief-stricken
and lashed by pangs of conscience. Spare me the anguish, Spielberg. The
grief should have been that of the Jews, not Schindler.<br /><br />When Schindler took off his gold ring and blubbers out &quot;I could have
saved one more&quot;, I experienced a feeling of mild revulsion. Look, the
guy did a great job, he saved a lot of lives. No point in getting all
worked up about the fact that he didn&#39;t literally sell the skin of his
back to save people he didn&#39;t know.<br /><br />What does this film leave us after 195 minutes of running time? Let&#39;s
see:<br /><br />* The Nazis were *Really Evil* * There was a man called Schindler who
didn&#39;t care about anything but money at first, and then for some reason
he started to care about saving the Jews.<br /><br />Brilliant, Spielberg. Positively brilliant.<br /><br />All of the above-mentioned flaws are bad enough -- but the way the film
manipulates the viewer really takes the cake. Shots of emaciated,
shaved potential Holocaust victims starving and screaming, with tragic
violin music to boot. It has been done in many films before, and will
be done again. It doesn&#39;t take skill for a film-maker to coerce the
viewer into sorrow -- It takes skill to produce the same feelings
without resorting to cheap, melodramatic trickery. The Pianist is a
superb counter-example. A journey of the mind is so much more
satisfying than a journey of the senses...<br /><br />Like most of Spielberg&#39;s films, Schindler&#39;s List is technically
outstanding. It captures the mood of wartime Germany perfectly. The
sets, costumes and cinematography are all top-notch, and the acting is
not too bad either. However, none of these things can overcome the fact
that Spielberg is a director of extremely limited vision. His moral and
intellectual depth is that of a child.<br /><br />Stick to making films for children, Spielberg. Stick to making
children&#39;s films. You&#39;re out of your depth.
