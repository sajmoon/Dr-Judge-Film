The brutality of Nazi Germany could never really be captured fully in a
movie. But, Spielberg does his best to be as brutal as possible, in a tale
about such a great act of kindness and compassion, in a time and place where
those words meant nothing.<br /><br />The shocking events that took place are difficult to watch at times, but
every person on earth should see this movie at least once in their life.
