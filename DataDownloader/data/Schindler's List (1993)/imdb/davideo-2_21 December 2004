STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A
Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs <br /><br />The true story of Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) a German businessman
during World War 2 who saved the lives of around 1100 Jews by creating
a use for them as labourers in his factories before moving them to his
hometown as a safe refuge from Auswhictz in the closing days of World
War 2.<br /><br />I&#39;m not sure quite what Spielberg was trying to accomplish by filming
this project in black and white,but if he was trying to add a
darker,more authentic tone than the film already had,he has
failed.There was colour back in those dark times of the Holocaust,and
it would have had a more real edge had it been included (with the
exception of a little girl running through a crowd in one scene in a
red jacket looking like she&#39;d popped right out of a Butlins
advert!)What he&#39;s succeeded more in doing is paying homage to those b/w
war movies from the late 50s/early 60s,and perhaps added a nice touch
of film noir for good measure.<br /><br />As a kid (when I originally saw this film) a film running at nearly
three and a quarter hours would have seemed like an eternity,but I must
say watching it again today the length did seem to run by comparatively
quickly.The film does seem to suffer from a lack of narrative
flow,although the actual story remains no less engaging.<br /><br />It is certainly a harrowing account of surely one of the most evil
events in human history.We see Jews being treated with less dignity and
respect than dogs,and the Nazis certainly put less value on their lives
than them.<br /><br />Neeson delivers a commanding central performance as the wartime
businessman propelled by his own needs and desires,but offered
salvation through his care and concern for the plight of the Jewish
people.There&#39;s good support,too,from Ralph Fiennes (who would go on to
accomplish even bigger and greater things-not including The Avengers!)
as the heartless,sadistic Nazi soldier and Ben Kingsley as Schindler&#39;s
wearisome accountant.<br /><br />Overall,this film doesn&#39;t manage to be quite as shocking as it was
trying to be by being filmed in black and white (which not everything
in life is,anyway!).Senior Spielbergo would go on direct another
powerful war film some years later by the name of Saving Private
Ryan,which had an unforgettably powerful opening sequence involving the
Normandy landings which was filmed in colour and managed to stick in
the memory much more prolificly.However,it is gut-wrenching stuff
nonetheless and certainly not a film that deserves to be forgotten in a
hurry.*****
