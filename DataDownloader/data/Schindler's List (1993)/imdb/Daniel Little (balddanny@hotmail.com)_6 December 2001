This is one experience that left me speechless, much like &quot;Saving Private
Ryan&quot;.  It's been said that writing about music is like dancing about
architecture, and the same holds true for movies, especially an experience
like this.  I won't even attempt to add any insight into what I've just
seen, words fail to do justice to this film.  Just go see
it.
