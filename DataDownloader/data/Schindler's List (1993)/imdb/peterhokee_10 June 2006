Its hard to believe that this movie came from the same loins that
spawned &quot;War of the Worlds &quot;(crock of shite). As a male in his late
30&#39;s i prefer to watch this movie alone ie; unwitnessed by any females.
It never fails to move me. It is up there with Shawshank Redemption and
Apollo 13. The soundtrack is just &quot;spot on &quot; as it is in the other
above-mentioned movies.When u compare Fiennes performance in this vs
The Constant Gardner , it shows his tremendous versatility. Likewise ,
check out &quot;Sexy Beast&quot; and remember Ishtak Stern.Kingsley-u are the
man.(remember that tear when he finally decides to &quot;have that drink&quot;
with Oskar) .As for Neeson,this is the movie he will look back on in
years to come with the most pride.To all involved, thank you most
sincerely
