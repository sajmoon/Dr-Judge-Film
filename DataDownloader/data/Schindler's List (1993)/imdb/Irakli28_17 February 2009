This is a wonderful educational film for kids, I mean the youth between
12-18, to inform them about the horrors of Nazism and the Holocaust,
but for adult Viewer who knows a lot about the Fascism and
Concentration Camps this film will seem too straightforward and even
tasteless. It is not enough to use a serious theme and a black and
white film to make a good picture. And I definitely do not understand
the viewers who behave as if they haven&#39;t seen any of anti-fascist
films of much higher quality.<br /><br />It is true -Mr. Spielberg is a great Master, Master of Manipulation and
a great specialist of Exploitation Cinema. This is what exactly he does
here - he exploits the Important and Painful topic of Holocaust (or it
can be slavery, terrorism, etc) being perfectly aware that many would
praise the film not for its artistic merits but for the STORY and the
MESSAGE, and if one dares to say that the film is lousy - he/she will
be immediately accused of being a revisionist, indifferent to peoples
suffering, holocaust denier and almost Neo-Nazi. <br /><br />Let me put this straight - I am none of these and still I think that
Spielberg film is not good. It is not good as a piece of art but it
might be good as an awareness raising reel - for those who had no or
very little idea about Nazism and holocaust, but for those of us who
don&#39;t need a gaudy movie from a Hollywood hack to know basics of
history - there is nothing of interest here - I can name two or three
dozens of feature films of documentaries that dealt with Holocaust much
better, I suspect many of admirers of this film simply have not seen
any of those. <br /><br />Uneven script and even worse direction is camouflaged with the
important messages and arty shell of BW photography. What comes tomy
mind is another film about Nazism - somewhere in mid 70-ies Art-Porn
maker Tinto Brass (of Caligula fame) took Nazim as a background for his
film Salon Kitty. He invited famous art house stars Tulin and Berger
who had previously acted in very highly regarded anti-fascist film of
great Lucino Visconti and made own film about fascism. The result?
Despite the sets, the stars, the important issues - the film still
ended up being Art-Porn - as this was the only thing Mr. Brass could
do. The same is problem with Spielberg - he might be really willing to
make an important picture but still ended up with what he is best at
making &#150; exploitation movie. <br /><br />As to the rain of Oscars &#150; well, didn&#39;t &quot;Around the world in 80 days&quot;
once get an Oscar?
