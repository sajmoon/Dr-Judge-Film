We need more films like this, there can never be too many. The history of
mankind is filled with gruesome crimes that too many have forgotten but
hopefully we will not forget the Holocaust. In the next ten years we will
lose most of the people that have a personal memory of the horrible ordeal
that was WWII. At the same time we have a growing number of historical
revisionists trying to rewrite history. (The revisionists are a part of
&quot;historical school&quot; trying to deny the existence of the
holocaust.)<br /><br />As a film this is not a perfect one. In truth it is maybe a 7/10 but what
makes it important is that it makes an important moral/ethical/historical
discussion easily accessible. Even the most uninterested student of history
can take in the importance of remembering  just how horribly cruel we humans
can be. But it also shows that we can all make a stand for what we think is
right and not only for what is right for us. The core of the entire story
just shows that in times of cruelty, humanity can still
prevail.<br /><br />This is the final proof that Spielberg is a man with a big heart, not only a
boy who loves fantasy.
