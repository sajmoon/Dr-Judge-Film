This is a nine-out-of-ten film for me, but I&#x27;m giving it a TEN just to
counteract the incredibly negative opinions of those people giving it 1
or 2.<br /><br />The film has some flaws, such as the campy scene at the beginning when
Schindler strolls up stairwells completely unhindered, like a God,
entering into an office full of neatly organised desks, orderly queues,
peace and quiet, people with time to express themselves... just to lay
down the foundations of what was happening at that moment in history.
Completely unrealistic and cheesy. And the bit where fat, naked old
ladies are running around the concentration camps, cutting to scenes of
extremely skinny men being examined, then cutting back to those fatty
ladies running around. Poor selection of extras.<br /><br />However, none of these criticisms can take away the pure mesmerising
enjoyability of this film. I&#x27;ve seen it three of four times and will
certainly watch it several more times before I die. Even if you don&#x27;t
like the film, it&#x27;s still so well filmed, researched, acted and
directed that it deserves at least 5 or 6, even if you hate the corny
Spielberg take on it.<br /><br />There, just to boost the ranking of this film UP a little bit more. A
TEN from me.
