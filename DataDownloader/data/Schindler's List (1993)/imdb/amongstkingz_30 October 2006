Out of all the movies I&#39;ve seen in my lifetime this is the best one I
have come across.The black and white color gave the movie a sense of
reality.It was as though i was back in the 1940&#39;s watching everything
transpire. Steven Spielberg is a genius,he brought the harsh life the
Jews had to face for several years during World War II.<br /><br />Liam Neeson role as Oskar Schindler was heart warming,courageous,and
executed with perfection.<br /><br />Raplh Fiennes role as Goeth was pure magic!!,he provided a villain that
will not be forgotten.<br /><br />Loved the movie from start to finish.
