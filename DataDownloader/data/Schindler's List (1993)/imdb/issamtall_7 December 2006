this movie, while extremely upsetting at times, was outstanding. this
was a compelling, heart wrenching drama that tugs on everyone&#39;s
heartstrings. not only do i suggest watching this movie but i suggest
that everyone who watches this should watch this multiple times to make
sure that you do not miss a thing. From start to finish this movie is
moving, and while at times may be rather disgusting, it is a must see.
Though the movie is a must see for everyone it is not appropriate for
young children. If you have read this review and have still not decided
to watch this movie i strongly suggest that you reconsider your
decision and rent or bye a copy of this movie immediately. This is a
definite must see and anyone who has not or does not plan to see this
movie is out of their minds. i promise you that if you do watch this
movie you will not regret your decision.
