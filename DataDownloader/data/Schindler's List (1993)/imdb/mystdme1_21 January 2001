Schindler's List deals with the horror of the Holocaust and the kindhearted
Schindler who helps the Jews by ironically forced labor. After the
liberation of the Jews, Schindler is considered a war criminal because he
profited from using forced labor. The movie is deeply compelling and for the
most time of the movie, I always found myself at loss for
words.<br /><br />The movie is very graphic and it helps people to visualize the brutality and
cruelty of the Third Reich. Slowly but surely, the National Socialist,
simply called, the Nazis worked their way up. Winning the trust and loyalty
of the Jews in neighborhoods then, betraying all the good things that the
Jews have done to them.<br /><br />In the movie and from history, the Aryan race, the pure whites, is
considered to be superior to everyone else. In truth, there is no superior
race that exists and if there is it is only the human race. The group where
we all belong, a group like no other.
