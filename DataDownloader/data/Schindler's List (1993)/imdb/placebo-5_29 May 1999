This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. While essential about the
heroic quest of Oscar Schindler, it accurately reconstructs several
aspects
of the holocaust, and gives tremendous emotional insight into the
suffering
of the Jewish people during World War 2. Spielberg's use of Black and
white
successfully translates the viewer into the historical setting. A must see
for anyone who loves great movies.
