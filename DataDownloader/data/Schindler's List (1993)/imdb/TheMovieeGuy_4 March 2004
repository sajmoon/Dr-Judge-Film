I distinctly remember seeing Schindler's List in a darkened theater during
my last year attending the University of Southern California, back in late
1993. The buzz about this film was astounding. Fresh from directing the
summer 1993 box office smash, Jurassic Park, Steven Spielberg was about to
completely abandon the famous popcorn movie for which he was so well known
to take on one of the darkest chapters of the 20th century, the holocaust.
Many critics doubted that Spielberg was up to the task of directing such a
dark moment in human history.<br /><br />This film is by far Spielberg's best dramatic film, this and Saving Private
Ryan proves beyond any doubt that Spielberg is more than capable of
directing a powerful dramatic film as well as other great directors like
Martin Scorese and Francis Ford Coppola. His use of black and white only
illustrates how great and mature a storyteller he has become in recent
years.<br /><br />The 11 years since it's release has deminished it's impact on society, but
let no one forget the haunting images of this masterpiece.<br /><br />The DVD looks completely amazing with terrific digital clarity, and great
sound. Unforunately, as with Spielberg's other films on DVD, this one has no
director's commentary whatsoever.<br /><br />This is defintely the best film of the 1990's and winner of seven Academy
Awards, including best picture. Oscar worth performances from Liam Neeson,
Ben Kingley, and of course, the memorable Ralph Fiennes!<br /><br />This haunting film also proves without a doubt that Spielberg is one of the
best directors to ever work in Hollywood!
