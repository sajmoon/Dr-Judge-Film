  &quot;Schindler's list&quot; ranks in two categories of films: The best movies in
cinema history as well as in that category of movies whose subject is what
people want to see transfered to the screen.  What I mean by that is this:
The story of &quot;Schindler's list&quot; is how a Nazi works against the rest of the
Nazis by making sure that all the Jewish people he can find will not be
killed in concentration camps but work in his factory instead.  In other
words, it's an anti-war and anti-Nazi movie.  And it's
great.<br /><br />  Liam Neeson is excellent as Oskar Schindler, the one Nazi who doesn't want
to see the Jewish people persecuted during WWII.  Ben Kingsley is very good
as well as Iztak Stern, the Jewish man who Schindler employs to run the
factory.  However, Ralph Fiennes performance is absolutely masterful.  His
role is a crazy Nazi officer in charge of a concentration camp and he does a
great job at it.  In fact, I believe he should have won best
supporting-actor in &quot;Schindler's list&quot;.<br /><br />  Moving, touching, and incredibly realistic, this based on a true story
movie is a true gem and honor for cinema history and it's quite
understandable that it is found among practically every movie-buff's top ten
list.  It also has the great advantage of having been directed by another
one of the masters, Steven Spielberg.  You've got to see
it.
