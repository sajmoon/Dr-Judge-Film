The film was great. In fact I saw it on video 3 times before I saw it on
cinema. The best scene was when the train with the women came to Austwitz
instead of Schindler's new factory. The starving prisoners and the snow
made
a great impression on me, and i must mention the black smoke that came out
of
the crematory. A great movie, didn't made me cry, maybe because of the
documentary-filming...
