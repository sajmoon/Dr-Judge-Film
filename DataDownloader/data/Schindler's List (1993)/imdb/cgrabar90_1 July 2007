This movie while disturbing, is a movie worth watching. It makes you
angry at the horrors the Nazies put the Jews through and it makes you
question mankind. It wasn&#39;t watered down and it shows that there can be
good in the heart of someone who seems hopeless. It&#39;s not a movie for
those made uncomfortable by the sight of blood. The violence in the
movie is what really happened to the Jews and the horrors they faced.
The emotion of the plot comes across to the viewer and brings it out.
Most of the people that I have spoken to have said that this movie
brings out what we have been trying to learn for generations. A very
good movie that all should see.
