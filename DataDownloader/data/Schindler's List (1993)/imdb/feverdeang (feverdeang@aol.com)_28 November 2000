I think IMDB was invented for me to get this off my chest, S.Speilberg is
not a FILMmaker as in film as art. SS is a movie maker,a talented hack
who's
success has gone to his head. Jurrassic Park, great escapist
fantasy,Raiders, handed to him on a platter by Lucas, Jaws, brilliant
horror,Close Encounters, a virtuoso UFO riff. In Schindlers List and
Amistad
we see two oppressed groups, the Jews and the African slaves are unable to
help themselves without help from the oppressive white man who is
subjugating them to begin with! Wouldn't a story about the Holocaust or
Slavery be more satisfying if it showed how the oppressed helped
themselves
instead of implying that THE STORY to tell about this particular period of
history makes the victims unimportant, interchangable, of NO consequence
except to motivate the &quot;HERO&quot;?? Also who is reading these scripts? Isn't
the
little girl in the red coat the SAME plot device( I don't even know what
to
call it, motif, ornament, twist??) as having Tom Hank's character release
the german soldier that ultimately kills him.?!? In short I think SS
should
stick to the kid stuff. There is a terrible rumor that he wants the rights
to Kubrick's last project &quot;AI&quot;!!!PS I hated E.T.
