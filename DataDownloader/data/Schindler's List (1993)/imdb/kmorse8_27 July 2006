This interesting story is based on largely unsubstantiated anecdotes.
Unfortunately, there is little or no documentation for the events which
are portrayed in this sort of &quot;Docudrama&quot;.<br /><br />That a Schindler existed is verifiable, but beyond that the film takes
huge liberties with the few known facts. It is in fact, a &quot;Fabricated
History&quot;, and has a propagandistic purpose. The novel and film based on
it are entertaining , and Spielberg is a skillful entrepreneur, but the
dark side of it was that it was more than likely undertaken by
Spielberg as an attempt to exploit the sufferings of victims of the war
for his own profit, and as a part of his continuing evident agenda of
retribution against WWll enemies of three-quarter of a century ago. The
perpetuation of hatred is not a noble purpose
