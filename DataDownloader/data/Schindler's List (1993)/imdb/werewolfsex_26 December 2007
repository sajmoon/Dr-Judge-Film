This is honestly one of the most overrated films of all time. Stephen
Spielberg (one of the most overrated directors of all time, who has not
made ONE honestly good film (yes, even including &quot;Jaws&quot;)) knew that
nobody could objectively criticize this movie, and basically exploited
the memory of the Holocaust in order to guarantee himself a
&quot;masterpiece&quot;.<br /><br />I am rating this movie as 1(awful), because of all the undeserved
praise. If this film were being judged solely on it&#39;s own merits, I
would probably rate it a 2 or 3 at best, for being exploitative,
dishonestly emotionally manipulative, historically inaccurate, and
artistically bankrupt.
