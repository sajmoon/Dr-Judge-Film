Schindlers list is the master at his best. its a pity that his next war
movie saving private ryan was not a patch on this one. this movie, unlike
SPR has the human element in it. <br /><br />The movies is an outstanding truelife story of one man's realisation of the
horrors of war. i wish the world leaders of today, who are eager to pull the
trigger to avenge the injustice done to them, will take time off and watch
this long but touching movie. spielberg uses excellent cinematic techniques
to showcase the horrors of war. though the movie is quite often disturbing,
that is the intention. <br /><br />the use of black and white throughout the movie is even more striking,
especially in contrast with the only colour used in two scenes. Schindlers
list is a powerful war movie and is rather long, but it is well worth a
patient watch, there will be no dry eyes at the end of this classic
movie.<br /><br />probably spielberg's best and one of the alltime greatest
movies<br /><br />a perfect 10.
