In a sentence, this film was excellence. Spielberg depicts the plight of the
Jews in the WWII Holocaust era with a frightening
amount of detail, and thus ensures that we don't easily forget what they
were put through. I liked the way it was shot in B&amp;W, as Spielberg knows
that most people have only seen the war in B&amp;W (on TV and the like), which a
lot of people seem to fail to realise. Also, when he does add colour, it
gives the audience a lasting impression.<br /><br />The cast was wonderful, the three main leads being excellent in their
performances (Neeson, Kingsley and Fiennes) and the supporting cast were
just as good. Janusz Kaminski's camerawork was brilliant. John Williams
score was incredibly
moving, and deserved the Oscar. The music is easily related to Jewish styles
of the period. On the whole, a brilliant film, unforgettable, and a lesson
to all. It shows that even the most hardened people can change.
