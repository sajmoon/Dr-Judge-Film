Everyone knows the story of The Holocaust.  Very few, including myself,
had
such intimate, detailed imagery to deal with.  From Issac Stern's
masterful
rendering of John Williams' opening until the very end I was unable to
tear
my eyes from the screen, much as I wanted to.  This film demands, in the
name of those living and dead, that you watch, that you have this
monstrous
example of human depravity burned into your very soul.  This film also
does
something wonderful; it gives hope.  Amidst the human wasteland we find a
small, inextinguishable flame of decency and justice survive that evil
wind's every attempt to snuff it out.
I came away from this film exhausted and bewildered.  Every emotion I
possess, vying for dominance, assailed me in a blinding white noise.
Should
I rage at the evil, the stupidity, the casual indifference?  Should I weep
for the suffering and loss?  Should I rejoice that, ultimately, a choice
for
right and good was made?  Eventually, I recognized that of course I must
do
all these things and more.  I must insist that every one I meet see this
film that reminds us of our obligation to history and to each other.  I
must
speak out when I see injustice being committed.  And I must never, never
forget.
