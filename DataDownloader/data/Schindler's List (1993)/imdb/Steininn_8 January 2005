Schindler's List (1993) is with out doubt one of Steven Spielberg's
most powerful movies and of all time. This great movie that Schindler's
List is, is based on a true story of Oskar Schindler, a glorious and
greedy business man who becomes a humanitarian and manages to save
about 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp.<br /><br />Schindler's List tells the true story of the Czech born Oskar Schindler
(Liam Neeson). Oskar Schindler is a business man who tried to make a
fortune during the World War II by exploiting cheap Jewish labor, but
ended up with nothing, but having saved about 1100 Jews from being
killed in a gas chamber in Aushwitz which was a concentration camp in
Poland. The two worlds meet in the movie when Schindler meets Itzhak
Stern (Ben Kingsley) an gifted accountant which runs Schindler's
factory. Since Jews were forbidden to own companies, Stern &quot;ran&quot; the
company and Schindler took care of the &quot;presentation&quot;.<br /><br />The film won seven Academy Awards, those for the Best Picture, Best
Director, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Score, Best
adapted screenplay; &amp; Best Art Direction-Set Decoration. Liam Neeson
and Ralph Fiennes were also nominated for Best Actor &amp; Best Supporting
Actor.<br /><br />This is easily one of the best and most powerful movies ever made. It
shows that there's something good in us all. I gave it 10/10
(excellent) for amazing acting and for it being very emotionally
effective. Steven Spielberg definitely at his best.
