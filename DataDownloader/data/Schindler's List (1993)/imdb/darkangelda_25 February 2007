I really did like, (though I&#39;m not sure that &#39;liked&#39; is the word i
should be using,) schindlers list, i didn&#39;t even mind the black and
white, though I&#39;m not sure why the little girl is in red. The film made
quite an impression, it was very vivid. I watched this with a group of
friends, but their were some of us on who it didn&#39;t seem 2 have quite
the right impact. To begin with it was very emotional, but it seemed to
me that they dragged the killing out a bit to much, and my mind started
to wonder, and i don&#39;t think that was the effect they were aiming for.
But over all this is a very good, very emotional film, which really
forced me to reconsider my feelings towards these people, in possibly
the most brutal way possible.
