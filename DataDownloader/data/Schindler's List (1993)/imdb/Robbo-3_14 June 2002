This film is a must see for anyone, it is based on the true story of
Oskar(Oscar) Schindler and his brave heroic saving of many lives during and
after World War 2.<br /><br />There is no way to explain how much Schindler did and must have gone through
to achieve what he did. This is not a sci-fi film but a film of one mans
manipulation of using evil people to save lives. The way Schindler risks his
own life by cleverly ensuring that he has made friends of the most powerful
nazis in the area he lives and works in, to ensure that if things go against
him he has an 'escape route' shows the mans intelligence.<br /><br />One of the main things that has to be said about Schindler was that he
certainly never could ever be classed as a racist, or as some have suggested
using the jewish people to save his own skin. This as shown in the film is
far from the truth, Schindler is awake to the evil actions of the nazis and
their intentions to wipe them from the face of the planet.<br /><br />For anyone thinking of watching this great film that is in two minds as to
whether to or not - the answer is go for it you will not be dissapointed.
The film as I say is based on fact and not to be sniffed at when looking at
what Schindler did for the jewish people, he saved the lives of many many
jews and of course their offspring, many jewish families today owe their
lives to Oskar Schindler.<br /><br />One of the best films ever made in my opinion and will always be rated as
such..........
