Poor acting, poor direction.  Every theme cannot be made into a movie.
This
tragedy in our time could not.  The horror of it all is just to great to
be
made into something the entertain, a popcorn smacking, no-nothing about
history, clue-less to suffering, average audience.  Would have been better
to have left it alone.
