&quot; I....pardon you.&quot;<br /><br />These words spoken by Amon Goethe (Ralph Fiennes) during the film can be
aptly used to signify the themes of this film: power and
forgiveness.<br /><br />I am part of the post war generation who has been lucky enough not to
experience any major war. And after watching this film, I have deep respect
and feelings for those who suffered during these times, be it the Holocaust
or the Nam war. This film was just waiting to be made and I'm glad it was
the right man who dared to take up the challenge. Any other person would
not
have done it justice.<br /><br />The film focuses on how a German named Oskar Schindler saved the lives of
thousands of Jews by employing them to work in his factory during WWII.
However, I feel the film's primary aim is not to show us Schindler's
kindness but the horrors of war. There are some of the most true and
graphic
scenes here ever captured on celluloid. People being shot for no particular
reason, hiding in fear, stripped and gased, abused......so much so that
viewers watching it for the 1st time will be deeply affected. We have never
got to see this &quot;flip side&quot; of the war in many Hollywood productions which
only focuses on action and their unrealistic &quot;gung-ho&quot; heroes. ( Another
excellent film would be &quot;Saving Pte Ryan&quot; by Spielberg again ) War and its
horrors are finally and faithfully recreated for the audience.<br /><br />Like the film Raging Bull, its shot beautifully in black and white to
reflect the era and tone of the film. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are
excellent, esp the latter for his frightening protrayal of Amon Goethe. The
scene where they discuss about power is a classic and the subsequent one
where Amon 'pardons' a young jew remains as one of my many
favs!<br /><br />
