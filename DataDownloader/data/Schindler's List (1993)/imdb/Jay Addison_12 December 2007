This is a film that will be remembered forever. There&#39;s not many films
that can boast that, but this film definitely can. It is truly one of
the greatest films ever made.<br /><br />Oskar Schindler started off the same as most of the men of his Nazi
party: He loved women, good wine, and making money. He started a
factory in the middle of the war and made money using Jewish slaves as
workers. He sold parts to Nazi armies, eventually becoming one of the
nation&#39;s wealthiest men. As he began to be invited into the inner
circle of the Nazi&#39;s, though, he began to see the horrors of what was
really going on; He began to see the horror of himself. And he began to
try to save the Jews.<br /><br />Shot in stark black and white with rare glimpses of color, Schindler&#39;s
List is a true masterpiece. Steven Spielberg completely recreates what
is one of the darkest times in human history with startling reality and
shows a new generation exactly how terrible it was. At the same time an
uplifting story, a horror film, and a dramatic saga, Schindler&#39;s List
will forever change you. It is a not a lighthearted film to be enjoyed
on a Sunday afternoon- it may disturb you. But it is a must-see for
everyone so that we can better understand what really happened in that
terrible war. Superb film-making is all around in this film. A must
see! 10/10 stars! <br /><br />Jay Addison
