OK - so the film was good - but its unrealistic the way that Schindler
remembered 1100 peoples names by heart :s <br /><br />taking into account that the factory workers were employed on the spot
- and unlike today where employers may remember your names from the
interviews - Schindler managed to remember all their names by casually
walking through his factory a couple of times, and sometimes saying
hello to them..... <br /><br />but overall i thought the film was good.....but not as good as 'la vita
e bella' which is a CLASSIC.....(and it has less unnecessary nudity,
and overall delivers the same ideology, but in a much more sympathetic
and heart-crunching way)
