I&#39;d heard this movie was one of the best of all time and I was curious
to watch it. Naturally, I expected everything of this movie and had
already set very high standards for it - Schindler&#39;s list didn&#39;t
disappoint. It is indeed one of the most fabulous movies of all time.<br /><br />The movie is difficult to watch, but truly touching. Spielberg
sometimes shows very graphic scenes, but its never overdone - these
scenes only add to the realism of the movie making it all the more
human.<br /><br />I must also comment on the use of black and white. This is one of the
rare movies where the conscious choice to use black and white instead
of color works well.<br /><br />the acting was great and the characters were very realistic. None
perfect - all human.<br /><br />Truly one of the best movies ever!
