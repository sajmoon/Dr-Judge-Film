I just have to chime in and agree with all the praise heaped on this
movie. A movie is great when it shows a fundamental truth. What is the
fundamental truth of this movie? The truth is that sometimes people
will have an extraordinary reaction to evil around them, and can change
their basic nature. Why is this so powerful? Because it is so rare.
Most people do not change their nature. Especially when confronted by
situations where it is easier to just go along. Oskar Schindler makes a
moral choice to not go along. It is tough. It is dangerous. Yet, he
makes the choice.<br /><br />I was once watching a show about the holocaust. The show was about a
recently discovered photo album, by one of the killers taken at
Auschwitz. One comment that one of the narrators said really stuck with
me. &#x22;What made these people so monstrous, was that they were not
monsters.&#x22; That is the true horror. Ordinary people during this time
period were just doing there &#x22;jobs&#x22;. In other words, what was so
horrible about the Holocaust, was not that these people were deviants,
but that they were so ordinary, and that this happened in our lifetime.<br /><br />In the movie Oskar Schindler starts out as an opportunist. He realizes
that he can become very rich by moving to Poland and taking advantage
of the desperate situation that has arisen there. He does this in a
masterful way, and soon becomes very rich. Gradually he realizes what
is going on around him he decides that he has to make a choice. The
choice is incredibly courageous. What was so extraordinary about his
choice was that so few people like him did so during this time period.
After the war, most absolved themselves of their responsibility by
saying, &#x22;I was only following orders.&#x22; An amazing story. Highest
possible rating.<br /><br />Offbeat trivia about this movie This movie was also written into a
script of Seinfeld. Jerry and his current girlfriend haven&#x27;t been able
to be alone. He decides to take here to a movie to make out. What movie
does he take her to? This one! This has to be one of the funniest
scenes ever in a comedy series. Who could write a scene that is
potentially so offensive, but yet hysterical. Much hilarity ensues when
Jerry is spotted making out during the movie by a relative.
