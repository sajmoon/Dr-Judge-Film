     I'm easily moved by movies, I'll admit.  It doesn't take much to make
me cry.  But the last few scenes of this movie set me absolutely weeping. 
Harder than I ever have before.  And, after it was over, it set me thinking:
about how people can be so evil, about how painful compassion can really be,
about how compassion can transform a person.  This movie is THAT
good.<br /><br />Where to begin? After seeing this, and my all time favorite movie, Saving
Private Ryan, I must say that Spielberg is the greatest director of our
times.  Hyperbole?  Maybe, but you find me another film with the power of
Schindler's list and SPR.<br /><br />Liam Neeson is an acting god.  Only he could've pulled this transformation
off without making it seem hokey.  I guess that's what made all the
performances in this film so great, from Neeson, Kingsley, and Feinnes down
to the slightest extra, was the lack of all the acting flourishes; all the
melodramatic conventions that might have gotten an easier emotional payoff,
but would have cheapened the movie.  Take Feinnes.  His character is evil
personified, Feinnes is never over the top.  The cold, emotionless look in
his eyes as he kills people is chilling enough.  And when an element of
humanity slips into his character, Feinnes makes it believable, not added
in.  His character isn't a stock villain.<br /><br />I'm probably running out of room.  Let me just say this film pulls no
punches.  It shocks you, terrifies you, makes you cry in sadness and in joy,
and makes you feel that most painful, unpleasant, and glorious of all
emotions: compassion.
