Schindler&#x27;s List is almost too painful to watch - a remarkably subdued
but traumatically powerful account of the greatest evil ever
perpetrated by mankind. I can&#x27;t watch it without weeping, not just
crying, but every time, I just weep. <br /><br />Spielberg sets aside all sense of melodrama and instead gives us not
only remarkable characterization in Oscar Schindler, Amon Goeth, and
Itzak Stern, but also brings an enormous sense of humanity and dignity
to an almost impossible subject. <br /><br />I cannot begin to say what it was like to see this for the first time
in the cinema the week it was released - it was simply the greatest
film I had seen - it truly captures something about human dignity and
hope as well as evil and complacency that go beyond words.<br /><br />I could write about the magnificent production, and filming, grading,
editing and care - but above and beyond this there is just the power of
the true story - that one man did make a difference is almost
impossible to comprehend given the odds and given the circumstances.<br /><br />Cinema at its very very best can capture both the reality and the
hyper-reality in a way that no other art from can - Schindler&#x27;s List
does - and it remains a living testament and the most powerful reminder
that we all can and must choose good over evil. <br /><br />Schindler&#x27;s List remains for me one of the greatest, if not the
greatest, film I have seen and I always knew it would be my 500th
review. Thank you Steven Spielberg, and I hope it will serve always as
a reminder why courage and good really matter.
