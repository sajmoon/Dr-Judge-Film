This, to me, is the cruelest film ever made. Sure, there have been many
films that have depicted cruelty in it&#39;s most realistic and most non
discriminating. LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL showed us a very true depiction of
the holocaust. CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST showed us how far people will go to
be known and to be famous. IRREVERSIBLE showed us a nine and a half
minute rape scene that is nearly impossible to watch and to sit through
without being forever haunted by it. SALO&#39; OR THE 120 DAYS OF SODOM
showed us pure innocence being destroyed and defiled by political
right-wingers. HAPPINESS showed us how deeply depraved and how inhuman
and mentally deformed some seemingly &quot;normal&quot; people are. VISITOR Q
depicted a family whose members indulge in the most disgusting,
horrific, and depraved and don&#39;t even seem to know that what they are
all doing is wrong. MONSTER was a film in which a prostitute killed her
customers, not because she got a thrill out of it, but because society
left her no choice. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE depicted a damaged and deranged
human mind and then showed us what happens when the body that mind
belongs to is no longer able to perform what the mind wants it to. PINK
FLAMINGOS shows us two groups of people who act in every bad and evil
activity known to mankind, knowing that it&#39;s bad and not caring.
However, SCHINDLER&#39;S LIST in my opinion, goes even further than all of
those films. SCHINDLER&#39;S LIST is a film that all of humanity should be
required to watch and sit through. I refuse to watch it again.
SCHINDLER&#39;S LIST was a film that affected me so strongly and so deeply
that just thinking about it frightens me. I&#39;ve tried to sit through it
a second time and got about halfway through, but I just couldn&#39;t handle
it and I refused to finish it. SCHINDLER&#39;S LIST is the closest we will
ever come to knowing what it was like to be a part of the holocaust. It
is among one of the darkest films I&#39;ve ever seen in my life. The film
itself is about Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi party, who owns a
company and puts Jews to work in it. However, on the opposite side of
the structure we meet a man named Amon Goeth. Goeth is a man who cares
so little about the value of human life that he target practices with
Jewish people in the Ghetto. To say that the violence in this film is
unflinching isn&#39;t doing the violence enough justice. We don&#39;t watch the
violent scenes as much as we full on witness it in at it&#39;s angriest and
goriest. People are shot in this film. We don&#39;t see people firing a gun
and then have the camera cut to people falling to the ground. We see
people helplessly held at gun to the head and then shot like dogs. We
see the blood shoot out very violently and graphically. We see it coat
the faces of the victims and the executioners. We see many more
horrific things. We see bodies blown apart, tossed aside, and broken
apart. We see rotting corpses cooked and we see the remains rain from
the sky. We see children get butchered and slaughtered as if their
young lives were worthless and expendable. We see it all and we feel
helpless. The people who do it don&#39;t see anything wrong with doing it
and even make games and goofy gestures out of it. Many people will have
a difficult time sitting through this film, but it remarkably
watchable. As cruel and as brutal and dark and gory as it is, it is a
flawless film. The film&#39;s ending makes it all worth sitting through. It
remains to be one of the most moving and emotional ending in motion
picture history. The final thirty minutes are so heart wrenching,
honest, beautiful, and strong that it is worth enduring two hours and
forty minutes of non-stop cruelty. The ending remains to be the of the
great endings in motion picture history. We may not recover from the
film, but what we gain from the ending alone makes it all worth
defiling your mind.<br /><br />PROS: <br /><br />-Absolutely perfect performances from the entire cast and all speaking
parts.<br /><br />-Unflinching and honest depiction of the Nazi Holocaust of the 1940s.<br /><br />-beautiful black &amp; white cinematography.<br /><br />-A true knockout of an ending! <br /><br />CONS: <br /><br />-none
