What can I say about this movie that will truly honor the masterpiece that
it is? Well, to start with, I can say that this is by far the best movie I
have ever seen. It stirs up numerous emotions inside me when ever I see
it. Spielberg- being a jew himself- has in a remarkable way, managed to
re-tell the story of the destiny of the WWII jews. One can almost believe
he
was there in person and lived through those years in the 40's.<br /><br />Schindler's List works like magic on the screen. Of course the actors,
Neeson, Kingsley and Fiennes in particular are tremendous, but what really
makes this one the milestone that it is, is the fact that it is shot
entirely (except a couple of min. at the very start of it) in black and
white. This makes the viewers completely captivated on what's going on on
the screen. It's almost as if we are being held in a state of believing we
are in the movie ourselves. No other movie I've seen can I say have made
me
feel that way. Steven Spielberg finally got the reviews and critics he
deserved for Schindler's List. He is truly the greatest Director of today.
No one can disagree there I think.
Make sure you all see this one soon, I promise you a movie so strong,
you'll
remember it for a long time to come.
