This film has touched me and continues to touch me every single time I watch
it.  For the people who have criticised it, I am stunned to say the least.
This is a faithful adaptation of the book &quot;Schindler's Ark&quot;.  And as for the
critics who said the at the little girl who had the red coat being a little
&quot;cheesy&quot; and a typical Speilberg moment, this little girl actually existed
and did indeed wear a red coat.  One moan, please can someone explain to me
how Ralph Fiennes lost out for an Oscar to Tommy Lee Jones (The Fugitive) -
if anything made a mockery of the Academy Awards, this decision
did.
