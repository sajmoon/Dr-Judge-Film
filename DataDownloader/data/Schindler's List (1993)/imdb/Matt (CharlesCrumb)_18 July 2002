This film is quite awful, if only because Steven Speilberg is intent on
viewing all tragedies of the past in terms of black and white.  I cringe to
think that Speilberg will eventually go about making an &quot;epic&quot; feature in
regard to the events that took place in September of last year.  And again,
I do believe that Speilberg is only capable of viewing major events of the
past or present, in terms of black and white.  Speilberg is much like George
Lucas, in that he has the imagination of a child.  A film of this nature
would have been much more effective as an in-depth documentary, but if a
feature must be made, then it should have went into the hands of a David
Lynch or Stanley Kubrick.  Steven Speilberg simply does not have the
emotional depth to bring a feature like this fully to life.  He is a highly
overrated director and should probably stick to making his laughable fantasy
films, and go about marketing toys and other such nonsense.
