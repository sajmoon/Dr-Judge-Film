Derek Zoolander and &quot;Zoolander,&quot; the movie share one thing in common-- they
are 100% pure cotton candy.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with cotton candy (although I admit I don't really
want a steady diet of it, either!) and for the occasion you want a shallow,
fun movie, Zoolander stands ready.
