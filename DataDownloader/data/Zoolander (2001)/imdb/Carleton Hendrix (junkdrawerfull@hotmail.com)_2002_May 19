When I first saw it, I thought it was more stupid than funny, and not funny
stupid.. But this was a film Directed, Written, and Produced as well as
staring Ben Stiller.. And even if it wasn't the best we have seen him, this
movie was made obviously to be exactly what Ben Stiller wanted.. I ended up
watching it again, it was on T.V., and I have watched quite a few times
now.. I now look at it as a movie movie.. meaning it isn't funny, and it
obviously isn't a action, drama, horror or suspense.. It's just a movie..
And it is entertaining, I have stuck it in many times to watch before bed..
I would put it on Repeat and play it all night as I sleep.. That is what I
call a movie movie.. So if your not looking to laugh a lot, but you want to
see something that just might be a little different, and entertaining, watch
Zoolander..
