I normally like Ben Stiller but I think with ZOOLANDER he has too many
irons
in too many fires . Directed by , written by and starring Ben Stiller
proves
you can have too much of a good thing . Stiller works best when he`s
playing
it straight in a comic situation like THERE`S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and
MEET
THE PARENTS  , but here he`s vainly trying to be funny and ends up being
silly . The script might have worked if it just concentrated on male
models
( Himbos ? Bimboys ? ) being pretentious with lines like &quot; Of course
models
help people . We make them feel good about themselves and show them how to
do their hair &quot; . Even if it had stayed on the subplot about Derek
Zoolander
returning to his roots at the mining town the script might have had some
saving graces , but no it suddenly turns into THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE
where
it loses all credibility and entertainment value .<br /><br />To see how satire on the male model industry works catch Sacha Baron
Cohen`s
ALI G IN DA USA where he plays a gay Austrian male model
