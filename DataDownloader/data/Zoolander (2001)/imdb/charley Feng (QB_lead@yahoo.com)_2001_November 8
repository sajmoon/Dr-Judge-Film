Zoolander, I must admit, was a funny movie.  I like it, because it was
funny.  Ben Stiller, the main character, playing Derek Zoolander, is a
male
supermodel who became entangled in a ridiculous web of crimes.  The
culprit?
Will Ferrell, playing Jacobin Mugatu.  Sounds insane? It is.  It
repeatedly
pokes fun at the modeling world, and although sometimes being very
stereotypical, is very funny.  It does not pretend to be anything but a
laugher, and succeeds mightily.
