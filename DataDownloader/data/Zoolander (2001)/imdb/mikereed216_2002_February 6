There's a fine line between a stupid comedy and a stoopid comedy. Let me
explain. A stupid comedy knows full well that it's stupid, and milks it for
all the comedic possibilities it's worth. A stoopid comedy simply blunders
it's way through, blissfully unaware that it contains the intelligence level
of your average pet rock.  Thankfully, Zoolander belongs in the former
category.<br /><br />Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) is the biggest male model ever, but his career
is now winding down as the throne is being handed down to up-and-coming hunk
Hansel (Owen Wilson). &quot;Maybe there's more to life than being really, really,
ridiculously good looking,&quot; Derek ponders. So, to find himself he quits the
modeling industry to help underprivileged children learn to read. But, soon
he is drawn back into the world of fashion when a lead designer offers him a
new line. <br /><br />Little does Derek know that he has actually been brainwashed to assassinate
the prime minister of Malaysia. Sound confusing? Well, as it turns out, the
modeling industry has been behind every political assassination for 200
years. There. Now you're even more confused.<br /><br />Well, see this movie and it might make a bit more sense. Yes, that is a
recommendation. Yes, it is a stupid comedy. In fact, it's one of the
stupidest I've ever had the pleasure(?) of seeing. To set the tone - when
Derek is presented with a model of his education center, he throws the model
to the ground, angrily saying that it needs to be &quot;at least three times
bigger.&quot; Stupid? Yes. Funny? Definitely. Worth seeing? Go for
it.<br /><br />Zoolander is rated PG-13 for language, crude humor, sexual situations, and
drug references.
