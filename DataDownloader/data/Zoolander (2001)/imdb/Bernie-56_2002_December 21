My teenage daughter said I wouldn't like this film. I did -- it's harmless,
soundly-made escapest fun. It's not serious, it doesn't take it self
seriously, it's not Oscar material and was never intended to be. You'd have
to be rather anal-retentive and uptight for it not to raise at least a small
smile at times. Heavens, this is light entertainment, not
Shakespeare.
