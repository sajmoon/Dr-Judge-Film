It mocks the MTV culture, yes, but it also can't help buying into it -- it
commits some of the same sins, shallowness, pop-culture reverence, overkill.
Stiller's schtick -- the funny walk, the crossed eyes, the sucking-in of
cheeks -- gets tired after a while, and he has written a one-note role for
his dad, Jerry. Beyond that, no complaints. Will Ferrell's an unexpected
riot, Christine Taylor a sweet foil, and the celebrity cameos are well
placed. Most of all, the costumes are deliciously tasteless. Stiller has
always been a master satirist, and the vacuity of the Seventh Avenue scene
is as ripe a target as anyone could ask for. A fine hour and a half of
escapism.
