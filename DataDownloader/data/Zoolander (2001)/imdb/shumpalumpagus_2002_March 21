Shoot yourself in the foot.  This would be better than watching ZOOLANDER.
Better yet, pay someone $3.95 to do it.  Or burn the money, that's still
good because you can enjoy the few seconds of flame.  But do not watch
this.
It will devour your soul.  It is a movie that makes me want to puke until
I
am dead.<br /><br />Seriously though this movie lacked a few things.  While having plenty of
cameos and famous people it did not have any of the following:<br /><br />1.  Funny Things
2.  A Plot Line
3.  Anything that made sense
4.  Understandable lines
5.  A reason to exist<br /><br />Save yourself now.  Run.  Before its too late.
