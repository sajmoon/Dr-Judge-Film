If you don't like this movie, you take things in general waaaay too
seriously. How can you not like a movie about male models that owes
more to The Manchurian Candidate than Ready to Wear? Pitting 5'2&quot; Owen
Wilson against 4'11&quot; Ben Stiller for the title of Male Model of the
Year? Tyson Beckford holding Zoolander's spittoon during the Walk-Off?
Billy Zane in one of the best self-referential cameos of all time? This
is a surprisingly amusing and thoroughly funny film. Most movies hit an
early stride and die at the end, while this one finds ways to amuse all
the way through. Just when you think it's all over (the &quot;2001&quot;
reference does not bode well late in the movie), you get break dance
fighting and Mugatu's desperate monologue about crazy pills and the
piano key necktie. Get some popcorn, a six pack and a good ounce and
relax in front of a funny, funny film.
