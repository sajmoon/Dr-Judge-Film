2002_March 30 

One day after i see this movie, he was out of cinemas. I thought it
strange
because was only there for 3 weeks, and in my opinion this is a brilliant
film. Many critics saw it as a film to tare apart the fashion industry and
then they thought the film had not accomplished his goal. I think this
film
is a comedy masterpiece because it has a not very original plot, a simple
man destroys an international plot to assassin the prime minister, but its
worked out fine. In this movie Ben Stiller plays Zoolander a stupidly
goodlooking and stupid male supermodel in the end of his carreer because
he
s too old (30, lol), and there s a new  male supermodel Hansel( Owen
Wilson
) who beats Zoolander not because he is more goodlooking or better model
but
because in a personal contest he can take out his panties without taking
his
trousers off and Zoolander cant(who would thought of that? A genius i
think). Comedy scenes in this movie are very well inserted in the plot not
breaking the movie into pieces. This is a film to enjoy and laugh, not a
serious movie neither a fierce critic to fashion world. Watch it and &ccedil;augh
a
lot, i did.
