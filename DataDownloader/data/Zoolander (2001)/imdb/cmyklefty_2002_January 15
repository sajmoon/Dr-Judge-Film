Ben Stiller acted and directed Zoolander with his real life wife Christine
Taylor who acted in this movie. His parents also acted in the film too.
Zoolander is about making funny about the male side of modeling. I found
that the plot was to weak through the picture. The only funny part in the
movie was when Stiller smash the model of the school building for Derek
Zoolander. If this comes on video, I do not think worth to rent.
