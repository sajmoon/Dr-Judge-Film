Last year's Meet the Parents already proved to the world that the
combination of Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson was funny. Zoolander shows that
the two of them can be downright hilarious.<br /><br />But be on the alert, schoolmarms: Zoolander is not a movie that wants to be
taken seriously. There's nothing in the movie that even comes close to
believability, let alone drama. However, this does not stop Zoolander from
being incredibly enjoyable.<br /><br />Ben Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, a male model who is really, really,
really, really good-looking (which is, given Stiller's cute doofiness, a
funny gag all in itself). Unfortunately, like most male models, Derek is
also a complete moron. For this reason, he is chosen by Mugatu, an evil
fashion designer, to assassinate the newly elected prime minister of
Malaysia. Why would the fashion industry care about third world politics?
Well, once in power, the new prime minister will put an end to the
practices
of child labor in his country. Since the fashion industry thrives on cheap
child labor, they need to stop the prime minister. And Zoolander, more
beauty than brains, is just the man to do it.<br /><br />Sound ridiculous? That's because it is. But don't worry. Zoolander never
focuses too much on the plot. Rather, it chooses to belittle and mock the
modeling industry, and it does so with a combination of gusto and hilarity.
Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller do a wonderful job of imitating the cocky
arrogance of male models, while at the same time somehow making their
characters likable.<br /><br />Wilson, who broke out into stardom with the Jackie Chan vehicle Shanghai
Noon, is wonderful as Hansel, the male model who threatens to unseat
Zoolander from the perch of male model superstar. Will Ferrell as Mugatu is
as hysterical as ever -- especially in the &quot;brainwashing&quot; scene. And
Christine Taylor, as TIME magazine reporter Matilda Jeffries, is also
likable. The inclusion of Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara (Ben Stiller's
parents) in small parts in the film, is the icing on the cake.<br /><br />Is it up for Oscar contention? Good god, I hope not. Zoolander is a
ridiculous movie, with more material missing from it than from the latest
designer's dress. It's not as much a movie as it is an hour and a half of
silly sketch comedy. But for a hearty laugh -- as well as a good escape
from
the scary chaos of the world today -- Zoolander should walk down the runway
the winner. It's clever, it's silly, and it's just what so many of us now
need.
