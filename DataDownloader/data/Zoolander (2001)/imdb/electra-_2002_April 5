My friend told me that this film was hilariously funny, he has a weird
sense
of humour at times, but he is not usually wrong.<br /><br />I cant really make my mind up about zoolander though, I thought it was a
bit
of a let down on the story line, a bit more things going on wouldnt have
made the film too messy, just more interesting.<br /><br />The acting is great, Ben Stiller has definitely gone up in my books since I
have watched this.<br /><br />If you want a nice chilled out, relaxing film that you can sit back to
watch
and not have to think about too much but will make you chuckle a bit, then
this film is great.
