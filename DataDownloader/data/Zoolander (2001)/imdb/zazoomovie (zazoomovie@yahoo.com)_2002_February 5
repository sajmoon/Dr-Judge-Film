2002_February 5 

I became a fan of Ben Stiller only recently, after watching him as a guest
in the program called `Inside The Actor's Studio' produced by James Lipton.
He was so likeable and naturally&#133; funny. When asked if being funny was a
skill or a gift, he replied that he didn't know how you could teach
somebody
to be funny. Before that, I had seen him in: There's Something About Mary
and Meet The Parents. At that time, I was more interested in watching
Cameron Diaz or Robert De Niro's performances.<br /><br />In his previous movies, Ben Stiller would portray a nice but unlucky guy,
so
incredibly unlucky that it was unnerving. With Zoolander, he remains a nice
guy, but instead of being incredibly unlucky, he becomes a victim. He is no
longer the hero - lacking super human powers though - who has to face
adverse circumstances to achieve his goal (conquer the woman that he loves,
or her family for that matter). In Zoolander, he is a kind of anti-hero who
had no goal whatsoever (apart from having absolute FUN &#150; even at the cost
of
human lives), until his fame shakes and he becomes a target of a dreadful
manipulation...<br /><br />I'd say, if you are NOT a fan of Ben Stiller; or if you are a fan of the
Ben
Stiller of his previous movies; or if you expect the comedy genre to be
witty and high-brow, stay home and wait until it's available on video to
rent Zoolander. You'll have a good time if you keep your mind open and want
to relax one evening.<br /><br />Derek Zoolander has only the look for him, and a big heart &#150; but other than
that, he is VERY stupid. In fact, he is a caricature, meaning that his
character is based on real life traits. But those real traits are found in
various persons. For the purpose of the caricature, they are mixed together
in one character and distorted with great exaggeration. As a result, people
are fooled: they think that someone like Derek Zoolander cannot be found
out
there in the real world, nor either of the other characters in the
movie.<br /><br />I especially liked the opening scene in the warehouse, where they plan to
kill the Malaysian Prime Minister and state the reasons why he is a threat
to the industry. I also liked the shots for Derek Zoolander's first
appearance, through the journalist Matilda Jeffries. There is a suspense
that was nicely built up: what is he going to look like?! Another of my
favorite scenes was the brainwashing scene, where he is made to believe
that
the children themselves claim for their rights to be able to work in the
factories. And I found the new historical perspective on Lincoln and
Kennedy
assassinations very funny.<br /><br />Because the whole thing is a true FARCE &#150; nobody feels threatened, very
rare
are the people who will gain a new insight, a fresh outlook on what our
everyday world is made of, how we contribute to model it by the choices or
non-choices that we make. So all is well, we are safe and we still have
fun!<br /><br />I found the theme of the movie very enticing: the modeling/fashion
industry,
and featuring a male model in a ridiculous manner is a great idea. The
directing by Ben Stiller was good. There was a good pace and the movie
moved
along smoothly. The only thing I missed was more `insights' on the modeling
industry, such as the flashback Derek Zoolander had on pretending to be a
monkey during a photo shoot. The David Bowie cameo appearance was very
nicely done.<br /><br />Some people didn't like the fact that Zoolander appeared as a kind of
`family movie', with Ben Stiller's Dad (Jerry Stiller as Maury Ballstein)
and his wife (Christine Taylor as Matilda Jeffries) play supporting roles.
Jerry Stiller was perfect for the role and great in this movie. Christine
Taylor was OK, but to me, she failed to inspire a special feeling for this
female journalist (good girl/bad girl?). Maybe the script was at fault, but
as a talented actress, she should have been able to carve an unforgettable
character for Matilda Jeffries. Think about Milla Jovovich's performance as
Katinka. She was absolutely fantastic. We need more striking performances
for female leads &#150; which are unfortunately still too rare on the
screen.<br /><br />I gave it 7 out of 10.
