If you have seen the previews or the trailer for Zoolander, then you have
already seen the funniest parts of this movie.<br /><br />Fashion and male modeling are ripe for parody, but Zoolander really has to
stretch the material thin to fill the (short) 89 minute running time.<br /><br />The movie gets old fast. The pace is slow and the jokes are too few and too
far between.
