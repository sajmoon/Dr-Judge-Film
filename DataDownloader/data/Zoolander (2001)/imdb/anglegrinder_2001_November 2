interesting premise; fashion model with IQ equivalent to shoe-size turns
trained assassin. Good opportunity to poke some fun at fashion and
advertising industries. The film fails because it seems pitched at an
audience that is no brighter than the film's main character. A bit more
sophistication and some more social comment and this could have been a
winner. Only for those who are satisfied with formulaic drivel....Simple
humour, a few laughs here and there, but nothing to rave about. wait till
it
comes on tv :)
