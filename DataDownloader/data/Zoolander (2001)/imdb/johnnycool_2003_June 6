when i saw this movie i cried then i laughed then i cried a bit more, then
we ate pizza mmmmm, only because this movie is one of the worst i have
ever
seen. zoolander what a stupid name, it would of been better if his name
was
gibblet monkey sucker. his special look blue steal then magnum whats up
with
that it sound like a ice cream. actually my mate ben when on the pull he
sticks his arse out when chatting to the bird we have nicknamed that move
the solaro like the ice cream.<br /><br />this movie should be banned for it atrocious campness and
dialogue.
i normally like ben stiller films eg that family film or the one about a
girl named mary, even the one where he is a rabbi is better than this one.
ben stiller should not be allowed to direct a movie again
