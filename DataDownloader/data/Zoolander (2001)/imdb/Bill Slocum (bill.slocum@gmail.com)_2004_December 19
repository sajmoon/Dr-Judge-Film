Ben Stiller not only stars but directs and writes this send-up of the
fashion world, playing a character named Derek Zoolander whom he
invented for a running bit on VH1&#39;s annual fashion show. Though there&#39;s
intermittent laughs, the padding really shows in a story annoyingly
full of itself.<br /><br />That goes double for Stiller, who thinks that playing his character as
vain and narcissistic will keep us from noticing how vain and
narcissistic Stiller himself can be. First, the whole movie exists to
serve his image, which has him done up in all sorts of costumes and
hair styles that show off his fine cheekbones and lean torso. Then he
casts his family in key roles. His wife, the attractive if lightweight
Christine Taylor, is the female lead and Derek&#39;s romantic interest. His
father Jerry has the plum role of Derek&#39;s agent. Even his mother, Anne
Meara, gets a quick, pointless cameo. Then there&#39;s his regular posse of
friends who all seem to show up in each other&#39;s movies, like Owen
Wilson as a rival model named Hansel and Will Ferrell as the villain
Mugatu, who wears eyeliner and blonde ringlets which form the shape of
a letter M.<br /><br />That&#39;s what&#39;s funny about this movie, the weird fashion. It serves the
comedy well. The problem is that there are long sections where the
fashion is the comedy, like Mugatu&#39;s odd sweaters and Derek wearing an
all-white outfit to a funeral.<br /><br />Male models are dumb. That&#39;s the main joke, and while I&#39;m happy to
unfairly categorize any group of people I am insanely jealous of, it
doesn&#39;t sustain 90 minutes of movie time. Nor does a strange espionage
subplot where Derek is brainwashed to murder the prime minister of
Malaysia. Some people like Roger Ebert attacked the film for trying to
mine comedy from such a thing as the cruel reality of child labor, but
the film&#39;s heart is in the right place. If it only had a brain...<br /><br />Watching this film once was amusing, but seeing it again reveals holes.
Take Derek&#39;s brief trip back to his New Jersey hometown where his
working class father and brothers are ashamed of Derek. This is hurt by
the fact Jon Voight as the father has zero comedy presence in his
scenes. Then there&#39;s a bit where Derek is consoled by Winona Ryder as
Winona Ryder, which serves only to ring up another of the many cameos
in this film, most ranging in character from obnoxious to repulsively
inside. Even Paris Hilton says hello. I guess Stiller had a fun
premiere night, and that may have been the point.<br /><br />Only two sequences hold up with repeat viewing, one a short bit where
we meet and see off Derek&#39;s roommates, and another, shorter sequence
where Hansel has a breakdance fight with an evil DJ. Ferrell&#39;s funny,
too, but the film doesn&#39;t give him much of anything to do except bulge
his eyes and say lines like &quot;That Hansel&#39;s so hot right now&quot; in a dry
femmy voice. Because it&#39;s Ferrell, you laugh, but it&#39;s not a role of
his worth remembering.<br /><br />The first time I saw it, I was about to go to a funeral, and I needed
some dumb comedy. This fit the bill. Still, it was hard to understand
why it was so popular when it came out. Then I checked its initial
reviews and realized it was released in late September, 2001. I guess
we all needed some dumb comedy then.<br /><br />The world has changed, but not &quot;Zoolander.&quot; It&#39;s still dumb.
