I can't believe people could pay out this film so much. I thought it was
stupid the first time i saw it but thats because i expected it to be
stupid.
I think people should go into this film with some respect for it and
they'll
enjoy it more. We own it on dvd and it's the funniest movie ever.<br /><br />plot cohesiveness? meh. i think the plot is just fine. i guess my
favourite
movies have plots that dont really hold togther well, eg 'the emperor's
new
groove' (my other favourite comedy).<br /><br />Anyway this has got to be the most quotable movie ever. 'What is this? A
center for ants?! How can we be expected to teach children to learn how to
read if they can't even fit inside the building?'
'obey my dog!'
and the whole david duchovny scene<br /><br />it just makes me sad other people don't appreciate this movie. everyone i
know who's seen it agrees with me that it's just brilliant
