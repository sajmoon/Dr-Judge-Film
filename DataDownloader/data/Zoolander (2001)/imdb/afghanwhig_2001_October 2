First off, I liked Zoolander. I laughed a lot, I loved the cameos, I
couldn't get enough of Frankie Goes to Hollywood, but I wished I could have
given this movie a higher score than 7. I can't. For some odd reason, I just
wasn't sold. Ben Stiller's portrayal of Derek Zoolander came across very
clunky at times, and the movie seemed to lack a whole flow, as if I was just
waiting for the next laugh or cameo. I know it's just a comedy, but Stiller
led a little movie called &quot; There's Something About Mary&quot; where I actually
did care, and I just didn't here.
