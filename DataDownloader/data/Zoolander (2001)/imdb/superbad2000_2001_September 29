When I first heard about Zoolander I was excited.  Saw the previews and was
uninterested.  But saw it opening day and have to say it sholves out the
laughs nonstop and it works on so many levels.  It is not a brain surgery
film.  It is not award worthy.  But it is Ben Stiller doing what he does.
Making people laugh.  The part when he says ILL to his real life wife in
the
film, when she explains she used to be fat was funny as
hell.<br /><br />See this.  Today, with all that is going on, this is refreshing.
