Just when I think a movie can't get any worse, along comes Zoolander. This
is absolutely one of the worst movies I have EVER seen. It isn't funny, it
isn't clever, the script is awful, the direction awkward, the mixture of
morality and lessons and feeble humor unbelievably lame and poorly done.  It
is awful from top to bottom and side to side.<br /><br />The only thing that I was looking forward to was maybe, maybe, Ben Stiller
would take his shirt off or something, but we didn't even get that! In all
seriousness, Ben Stiller is a good actor, and he had a concept which could
conceivably have been hilarious, but it takes more than one single good
actor to make a movie. <br /><br />There are many many funny movies, that I have laughed it, (most from the far
past), so I am not without a sense of humor, you see. It is absolutely
beyond my comprehension how so many critics can think this is a good movie. 
But then, for all I know this is better than much of what's out there these
days.
