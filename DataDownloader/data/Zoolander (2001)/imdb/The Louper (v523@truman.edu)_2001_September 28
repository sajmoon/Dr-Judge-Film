People that go to comedies often come out saying, 'All the good parts were
in the previews.' Ben Stiller's Zoolander didn't get that response from me.
The response it did get was, 'The previews were funnier, and even they
weren't really funny&#133; Sigh.'<br /><br />There are funny moments in the movie but I could count them on one hand and
still have enough fingers left to count up to three. I'm not counting the
moments from the commercials that were funny once, some even twice, because
the media saturation on this movie sucked the humor out of them long before
the theater lights darkened.<br /><br />Ben Stiller is entertaining and annoying, mostly the latter. In fact,
Zoolander as a whole is slightly entertaining and mostly annoying. And it's
slightly entertaining in the way that someone farting is slightly
entertaining.<br /><br />There really needs to be no comment on the acting, apart from two things:<br /><br />1) Ben Stiller has an accent throughout the entire movie. Did I miss this,
somehow, in the previews? Or was it cleverly hidden just because it was so
annoying? It reminds me of how the promotions for Crouching Tiger, Hidden
Dragon never mentioned the subtitles. People started watching the movie and
groaned, 'This has subtitles? Aw, geez.' That's how I felt about this
accent.<br /><br />2) Will Ferrell is just plain annoying, entirely. His constant overacting
is
painful to watch, even in a film like Zoolander that is pretty much built
around overacting. He's seldom funny (in general, but also in this movie)
and, again, mostly annoying.<br /><br />I don't want to put more effort into this than Stiller apparently put into
Zoolander, so, in summation, as above: it's slightly entertaining in the
way
that someone farting is slightly entertaining.
