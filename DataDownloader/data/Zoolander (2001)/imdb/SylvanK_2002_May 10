I was expecting another abysmal American comedy on par with 
Scary Movie. What I got was a hilarious lampoon of the fashion
industry, celebrities, and models. Between impressive acting all
around, sharp jokes, and decent dialogue through most of the
film, I found Zoolander highly enjoyable. Not a bad choice for light,
irreverent humor.
