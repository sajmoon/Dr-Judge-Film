This movie may have had somewhat of a weak plot (which is part of the humor
in itself) but the actions of all the characters in the movie are
hilarious.
Ben Stiller plays a somewhat 'dumb' (putting it lightly) male model. He's
been hypnotized to kill the prime minister of Malaysia. All the characters
are great and the humor is non-stop. I laughed in the car on the way home.
So go see it &quot;You freakin' idiot!&quot;
