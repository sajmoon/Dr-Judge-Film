I wasn't expecting too much from this movie but I enjoyed. It made<br /><br />me chuckle and laugh out loud and how often do movies do that<br /><br />anymore??<br /><br />Ben Stiller is great as always and there are some really funny<br /><br />moments in this movie skewering pop culture,  Models  and<br /><br />Movies and even a a clothing line based on the homeless.<br /><br />Politically incorrect movies are fun and this is one of them.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, sit down have a drink, maybe smoke a bowl<br /><br />and and have a good time.
