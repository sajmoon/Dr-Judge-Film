Derek Zoolander is an international model-slash-actor. But his life has
taken a tragic turn: he loses an award to new superstar Hansel, his
friends die in a horrible gasoline accident and he is ready to quit the
business. Things seemingly turn around when he is offered a job as the
face of the new Derelicte clothing line, but his handler has more
sinister intentions.<br /><br />I&#39;m not particularly a fan of Ben Stiller or his films. He&#39;s often
annoying and not very funny... and not even particularly handsome. He
is a better background figure (&quot;Happy Gilmore&quot;) than a lead (&quot;Something
About Mary&quot;). So why does this film entertain me? I&#39;ll tell you: the
celebrity cameos. We have some great co-stars (Christine Taylor is
awesome and sexy, and Will Ferrell has one of the best roles of his
career here).<br /><br />What sold it for me (besides Farrell) was the Billy Zane cameo. Sure,
Lance Bass and Fred Durst were funny. Natalie Portman is hot. And David
Bowie does the best David Bowie impression on earth. But Zane sold the
film when Owen Wilson said, &quot;You should listen to your friend Billy
Zane. He&#39;s a cool dude.&quot; That was the funniest line in the film (but so
true).<br /><br />In all fairness, Stiller is better here than in other films. And there
are plenty of memorable scenes -- the gasoline accident scene takes the
cake, with perfect music playing (Wham!) and everything looking just
right. I also really enjoy the trance sequence -- one of Ferrell&#39;s best
scenes ever filmed.<br /><br />As far as Ferrell-Stiller-Wilson movies go, this one isn&#39;t at the top
of the pile, but it&#39;s clearly above the halfway mark. Even non-fans
will find something they like and I guarantee a few laughs along the
way. My second viewing was more enjoyable than my first and I suspect
this is a trend that grows with subsequent viewings.
