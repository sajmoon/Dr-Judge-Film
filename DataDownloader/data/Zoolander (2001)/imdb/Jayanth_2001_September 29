The flick is a delightful look at the male modeling world seen through the
eyes of Austin Powers. Ben Stiller does a great job. If you are the type
who
can just sit back, relax and enjoy things without thinking too much, then
this is the movie for you. Derek Zoolander is a stupid male model who is
hired by a fashion mogul to kill the Prime minister of Malaysia.
