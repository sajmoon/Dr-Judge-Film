I was a person who didn't immediately recognize David Duchovney (did I spell
the last name right?) and I feel completely stupid. For a small part, I
thought it was 3/4 of a good performance. It lacked some flair from Fox
Mulder.<br /><br />Although.....<br /><br />&quot;Who are they angry at?&quot;
&quot;MUGATU!&quot;
&quot;Slaves, Derek.&quot;<br /><br />That was pretty good, even though it wasn't verbatim.<br /><br />Who else didn't recognize Duchovney? Be honest.<br /><br />P.S. A large apology to Duchovney fans. I like him also, but he needed a
somewhat larger part
