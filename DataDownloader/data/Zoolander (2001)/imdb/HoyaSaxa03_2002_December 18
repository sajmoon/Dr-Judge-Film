zoolander took a little while to grow on me.<br /><br />i enjoyed it and laughed when first seeing the movie in a theater, but it
wasn't until repeat viewings that the humor really took
off.<br /><br />every scene and bit in zoolander is meticulously constructed in the
tradition of ironic greatness. once you understand the approach ben
stiller
is taking as a comic filmmaker, you can really sit back and enjoy his and
the entire cast's genius.<br /><br />owen wilson is, as always, unbelievably funny. his sense of timing and
amazing wit really dominate the film. while will ferrell again proves
himself as one of the great comedians of our generation, jerry stiller
shows
that he has at least few years left in him (as long as he can still
cah-p**s)<br /><br />go see this movie. if you don't like it, see it again.<br /><br />trust me, it will grow on you too.
