I really wonder what that 'six' rating is all about ...<br /><br />This is a movie I have watched several times, and every time the
overall silliness gets to me. The wonderfully goofy mock-intellectual
conversations among the models, the recurring misunderstandings caused
by differences in a model's skewed grasp on things and the actual
reality surrounding them, microscopic cell phones .. it's just funny as
hell. Owen Wilson, whose life consists of a series of gadgets, fads,
drugs and leisure time only, Ben Stiller taking a trophy he did not
actually win (Michael Jackson should have been hosting that ceremony
..). It's all good enough for me.<br /><br />What I appreciate even more about this movie is the visual perfection.
So much work has been invested into creating interesting sets and
locations, great lighting and camera work, with the weird
'indoctrination sequence' in the day spa taking the cake. The great
number of cameos adds to the mix - &quot;Put a cork in it, Zane!&quot;.<br /><br />Anyway, always enjoyable and a pleasure to watch. You can delve for
deeper layers, like Ben tries to do for a day with the equally
spike-haired relatives (&quot;I'm not a professional television or movie
actor!&quot; - Jon Voight), but that's probably not what this movie was made
for.<br /><br />For entertainment, comedy and production values, I will happily concede
an 8/10.
