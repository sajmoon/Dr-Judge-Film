This is one of the very few movies that I have seen that has made me laugh
out loud in the cinema.  Ben Stiller is fantastic, his wife is gorgeous,
Owen Wilson is excellent.<br /><br />I can't think of one bad thing to say about it.  This is not the kind of
movie that needs to be analysed, it's the kind of movie that you should
just
enjoy.
