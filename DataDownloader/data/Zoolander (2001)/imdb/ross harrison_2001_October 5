Derek Zoolander (Stiller) is the worlds top male model and dumber than a
half empty jar of baby-food.  In fact Derek may be both the stupidest and
best looking man on the planet if not for his only rival:
extreme-dude/Hippie-Male Model, Hansel (Owen Wilson).   The two pretty-boys
must put aside their bitter rivalry and team up with sexy girl reporter
Matilda Jeffries (Chritine Taylor&#133; that's the girl who played Marsha in the
Brady Bunch movies) to foil an assassination conspiracy headed up by the
international fashion industry and their deadliest operative the evil
designer Jacobim Mugatu (Pronounced Jacobeem Moogatoo) played by the
funniest being to exist in this universe or any other, SNL's own bellowing,
infinite wellspring of hilarity Will Ferrell (Pronounced exactly how it
sounds.)<br /><br />Zoolander has the same kind of highly visual, campy feel of Austin Powers. 
Where as Powers zinged 60's style Zoolander mocks contemporary fashion
culture.  The getups in Zoolander make the costumes from Bat-Man and Robin
look like the wardrobe of somebody's conservative 1950's Dad.  In a day in
age where Hollyrock (sorry I mean Hollywood&#133; I forgot I'm not a Flintstone)
gives us one lame rip off after another Zoolander proves refreshingly
original.  Case in point, how many films are bold enough to have a group of
male models accidentally blow themselves up while having a semi-homo-erotic
gasoline fight at a service station to the hit 1980's  Wham song `Wake Me Up
For You Go Go?'  That might have sounded confusing but trust me it's pretty
inexplicable when you see it in the movie too.  But it's weird stuff like
that that makes Zoolander a laugh per nanosecond.  And here's fair warning
when the Hypnosis scene starts put down your refreshing coca-cola (or is it
Pepsi that owns our school?) because you'll laugh so hard that your generic
soft drink won't just shoot out of your nostrils but every single orifice in
your body!  Of course the same warning could apply to Male Model  `Walk off'
duel, Derek's romp through the coal mines and basically every time Stiller,
Ferrell or Wilson are on screen.  I couldn't endorse this movie anymore
without having to get a full body tattoo of the films entire story board..
but (to quote Levar Burton's famous `Reading Rainbow' line) &#133; `don't take my
word for it'&#133; hear what people sort of just like you had to
say&#133;<br /><br /> - `The Best Original comedy in years.'<br /><br />- `I'm like totally going to buy the sound track.'  (She was right the track
rocks.)
