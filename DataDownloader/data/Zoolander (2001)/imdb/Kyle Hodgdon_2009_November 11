Normally, I hate, hate, hate movies like this one; stupid comedies are
not for me. But I must say that &#x22;Zoolander&#x22; was much better than I was
expecting. <br /><br />It takes a lot for me to laugh out loud, but I think I might have a few
times during this movie. The gasoline fight and Derek&#x27;s reaction to the
model center for reading are two such occasions. <br /><br />I am definitely not a Ben Stiller fan, but thought he was not bad in
this role. Owen Wilson is not at his best, but not bad.<br /><br />It is still a little too stupid for me to give a higher rating than a
six, but this movie has some funny spots, is good natured, and has it&#x27;s
heart in the right place.
