Ben Stiller's act of Derek Zoolander has always been funny on TV but
unfortunately only so-so on the big screen.<br /><br />Spoofing models was a good idea but I'd like to have seen this shot like a
mock-u-mentary. Instead of being about some kind of child labor
assassination plot thing.<br /><br />The movie does do a good job by not really making that the focus and
instead
allowing the movie to be a spoof. There are some great moments like at the
end when Zoolander turns left. Will Ferrell is one of my favorites and
shows
why here (although he has done better). Owen Wilson is good but his
character seems to change. At first he seems much smarter than Zoolander
and
then appears to be just as stupid. The &quot;walk off&quot; was brilliant but took
too
long. A mistake most spoofs make.<br /><br />Ben Stiller's wife plays the reporter/straight person of the movie,
outside
of being a vehicle to push the movie along and to set up a couple jokes,
she's useless. Jerry Stiller's character is even more useless but he helps
the move close with a scooby-doo ending.<br /><br />Overall the movies just seems hollow and never really grabbed my interest.
Instead I was looking at a movie that I felt I should've laughed at more
but
it failed to make any connection. Good fun but I'll never see it again 5
out
of 10.
