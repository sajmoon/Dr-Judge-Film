'Male Models' is an easy target for some cheap shots, and at times,
'Zoolander' delivers well. Then again, at other times...<br /><br />Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) and Hansel (Owen Wilson) are two
rivalling models who find themselves in some sort of
killing-all-the-world-leaders scheme, which apparently is part of the
Male Modeling job. They're being helped out of the mess by Matilda
(Christine Taylor), a reporter for Time magazine.<br /><br />Funny at times, though nowhere near the recent Stiller-Wilson team-up
Starsky and Hutch. As my summary says: it's all pretty average.<br /><br />5/10.
