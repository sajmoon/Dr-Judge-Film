Bin Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, the world's premier male model and
Owen Wilson plays Hansel, the up and coming star threatening Zoolanders
status. However, when Zoolander is brainwashed into killing the
Malaysian Prime Minster, Hansel and a reporter team up to help
Zoolander and save the Prime Minister.<br /><br />There were a couple of very stupid moments that were quite funny, but
overall most of the jokes were just stupid. Some of the fashion
clothing and background jokes were quite cleaver but the blatant
stupidity was too annoying to make the movie worth watching again.
(Maybe I just wasn't in the mood?)
