I'll admit it, I'm a Ben Stiller fan. I have never seen him do poorly in a
comedic performance. This is some of his best work. His character's utter
stupidity provides many laughs. Will Farrell also does a great job as
Mugatu. Overall, this is a great parody on the fashion industry and fashion
itself.<br /><br />Grade: A+
