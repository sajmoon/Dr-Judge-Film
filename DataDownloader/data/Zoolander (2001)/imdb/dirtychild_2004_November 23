Derek Zoolander is a fading male model. When beaten by rival Hansel for
VH1's male model of the year award - he quits the business to find his
roots. Meanwhile - the Malaysian PM is crusading to end sweat shops.
Mugatu, an evil fashion designer, decides to brainwash Zoolander to
make him assassinate the PM. Logicial... isn't it!<br /><br />This movie is dumb fun. You won't be using more than 3% brain activity
watching this. Both the leads are likable and charismatic. I love the
orange mocha frappichino fight scene! There are some classic lines in
this film and some great cameos.<br /><br />The movie tends to drag (towards the end) - and the love interest is
unnecessary. But this seems to be the symptom of most 90 minute
American comedies! They all seem to get bogged down in morals and
trying to put forward a message...<br /><br />Anyhows - this is dumb, non-offensive fun (for the most part).
