... is painfully belabouring the point that Hollywood indeed
panders to the
lowest common denominator. I'm flabbergasted at the idea that anyone can
consider this diarrhoea on film funny. Seriously, I'm all for taking my
brain off the hook for an hour-and-a-half and letting a silly movie caress
my addled mind, but there's a point at which that stops, and this movie was

Stiller's salary and the film's profit margin.<br /><br />And were I Mr Stiller, I would be equally ashamed to look at myself in the
mirror every day, knowing I committed this piece of crass, pedestrian,
witless and boorish filth and foisted it on the world.
