This movie is 100% pure Ben Stiller.  This is probably the movie he's been
waiting his whole career to make.  If you're a fan of his previous work then
you're going to love &quot;Zoolander.&quot;  If you hate Stiller, then you'll hate
&quot;Zoolander.&quot;  As for me, I thought it was really funny.  Not as funny as
&quot;There's Something About Mary,&quot; but pretty friggin' funny!  And you'll never
listen to Wham's &quot;Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go&quot; the same way
again.
