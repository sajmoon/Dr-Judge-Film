Welcome to the glamorous world of male modeling. From award
presentations to walk offs, this movie provides the insider&#39;s
perspective to just how tough male modeling really is.<br /><br />The male model&#39;s mind is a complex microcosm of thought and emotion.
This movie hopes to give you a glimpse of it works and what makes the
male model tick.<br /><br />Appearances by male models, Paris Hilton and even David Bowie himself
who referees the walk off duel make this film a true gem.<br /><br />Whether you are curious or just really really ridiculously good
looking, I highly recommend watching this movie.
