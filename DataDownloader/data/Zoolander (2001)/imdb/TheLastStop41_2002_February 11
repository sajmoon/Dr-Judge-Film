 Though I had a comment on this movie before, I have to say again, that it
was a disappointment and I would recommend this if you don't want to look
into the world of stupidity. The only good thing really about the movie was
that it had extremely good potential, but it really blew it. It's one of
those movies where your phsyced about it, but when you it's blah... A lot of
talent was wasted in the movie. It had a pretty good cast, not great, and a
good modern comedian, Ben Stiller. Ben Stiller has done much better in his
career. He was great in Keeping the Faith and Meet the Parents. I didn't see
Something About Mary, but it sounds hilarious from what I here on this site.
I'm guessing it is, because it's done by the Farrely Brothers who created
the comedy which is destined or already is a comedy classic Dumb &amp; Dumber.
But anyways with Zoolander, it's disappointing. If you want to see a good
comedy brought to you in 2001 see Rat Race. That was one of the most
pleasantly surprising movies I've seen in a while too. Another pleasant
surprise from 2001 was Legally Blonde. Zoolander is a disappointing
surprise. Zoolander's rating which has lowered from my last review is now
3/10.
