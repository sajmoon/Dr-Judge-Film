I've read through some of the reviews and frankly I'm perplexed.  I can't
understand how any one could like this movie.  I'm a big fan of slapstick
(Dumb &amp; Dumber, The Jerk, etc.) and I like Ben Stiller, but this was the
most unclever, unfunny movie I've ever seen.  In fact, this flick was just
plain annoying from the start.  In fact, I had to shut it off half way
through.  Do your self a favor and don't reward the people who created
this
movie by renting it. This movie gets a 1/10.
