All male supermodel Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) wants at the moment is to
discover whether there's more to life than &quot;being really really really
ridiculously good-looking.&quot; But badguy fashion designer Mugatu (Will
Ferrell, in an inspired, hilarious charicature) has other ideas: he's
looking for the dumbest guy in the fashion industry to assassinate the
president of Malaysia.<br /><br />It strings its gags together with the form of an espionage thriller: the
plot of which has badguy Mugatu looking for a really <br /><br />Laugh-out-loud comedy performances, fun satire of modelling industry and
terrific chemistry between duo Stiller and Owen Wilson.<br /><br />It has enough terrific lines and moments that a group of friends will see it
together and feel like repeating the lines to each other for weeks on end.
I've seen it happen - with more than one group of people.<br /><br />10/10.
