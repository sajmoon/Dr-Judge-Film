This was not the funniest movie in the world but there were some laughs
from it. Ben Stiller was perfect for the role as Dereck Zoolander and Owen
Wilson was perfect for the role as Hansel. They are a great duo. I also
like
the cameos that popped up throughout the movie and was really surprised to
see David Bowie! Overall Zoolander was not that bad.
