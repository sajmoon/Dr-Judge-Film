STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal
Instead*Avoid At All Costs<br /><br />Zoolander is a worthwhile comedy,with some hilariously funny moments.Ben
Stiller and Owen Wilson create some fine chemistry between themselves as
rival supermodels,and there are surprise cameos throughout the whole
film.The plot loses a fair bit of cohision as the film progresses,but the
funny moments manage to keep flowing thick and fast.It's got a wise running
time of 85 minutes,and there is a cool soundtrack.Not as good as it could
have been perhaps,but still a very impressive directing/starring debut for
Stiller.***
