When I first saw this I was expecting a total disaster of a movie.
Persuaded by my older brother, I rented it and watched with a skeptical
mind. I like Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson OK, but the idea just seemed
so stupid and the fact it was based on some short on VH-1 making fun of
male models seemed like it wasn't thought out too well.<br /><br />What I ended up doing was laughing so much I nearly died. This movie's
story is definitely pretty ridiculous and not completely thought out,
but the list of characters and cameos alone make this worth a treat.
This is probably the funniest I've seen Will Ferrel, and Jerry Stiller
plays his usual old crotchedy man with flying colors. Almost every
scene with them makes you laugh out loud. It seems pretty obvious that
even though it was a feature film, Ben Stiller seemed to have a lot of
control over this. Definitely isn't made to please the masses, but those
who can appreciate ridiculous, campy humor and are fans of these actors
will find themselves wanting to show this movie to anyone who hasn't
seen it. I won;t ruin any of it, except to say the funniest line in the
movie is &quot;Merman! MERMAN!!!&quot; And expect many great cameos, especially
Billy Zane. You'll understand once you see it.
