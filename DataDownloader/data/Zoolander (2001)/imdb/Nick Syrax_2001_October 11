most horrible, boring, useless, waste of money movie i have ever
seen!!! Me and my girlfriend almost walked out. The scenes that
were in the previews that we saw that seemed funny, when put into
context with the rest of the movie, were no longer funny. I really
didn't see anything redeeming about this movie. I was even
disappointed by Will Farrell's part in the movie! I wouldn't even
watch this if it came on cable! Actually, i think if i did see it on
cable,
I'd probably cancel my service!!! I'd rather watch a Pauly Shore
movie marathon!!!
