i found this movie to be very funny, witty and incredibly stupid. I
went into the theater expecting a stupid movie about a stupid
supermodel and got it, and then some. certain parts such as when
they are trying to turn on the computer are clever but very stupid
and perhaps even unnecessary (along with others), however the
dialogue between Zoolander and the journalist after a funeral is
very smart. A definite must-see if your feeling dumb that day...or
just open-minded. Really open-minded.
