My wife says this film is absolutely stupid, and I agree.  It started out
slow, but picked up halfway through.  She gave it a 2, and I gave it a 6.  I
guess that makes this movie a 4.  Anyways, I love the part where he says,
&quot;how do you expect kids to learn in a school that small&quot; is funny. The
change in music at the fashion show is funny, in a stupid way.  Very 80's, a
good decade for high tech style.
