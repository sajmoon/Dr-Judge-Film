When a scheming fashion designer named Mogatu unleashes a plot to assonate
the Prime Minister of Milasia he brainwashes male model Derek Zoolander to
do the job for him. With three of today's most promising comedic talents
(Ben Stiller, Will Ferrell and Owen Wilson) you would expect a lot more than
this but hey what can you do? What we have here is a parody of the fashion
industry that will prove hilarious to some and painfully stupid to others,
but who can honestly say that they wouldn't want their children going to the
Derek Zoolander Centre for Kid who can't Read Good? Much to goofy to be a
smart satire although it has some very smart scenes, one in which male
models are made out to be more like apes than men, or when Derek inquires
that you don't spend a week in a d-a-i-y-e spa, funny stuff. Ben Stiller is
hilariously stupid as Zoolander, Owen Wilson is equally as stupid and funny
as Hansel, Zoolander's competition who seems to be parodying Doors front man
Jim Morrison more than a male supermodel. The film features hundreds of
cameos from all of today's hottest starts. You can catch a glimpse of
everyone from Fabio To John Voight. You may hate yourself in the mourning
but Zoolander proves to be pretty darn funny while it lasts as long as logic
is not required.
