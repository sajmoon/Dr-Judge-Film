 The is a very silly comedy about the world of  male models.  In essence
male models are portrayed as very dumb such as not knowing to not play with
gasoline while smoking.  All the humor seems to center around male models
who are dumb as dirt as well as vain.   I have read other reviews and to my
surprise it was considered funny.   My advice is to look at the movie
trailer for this film.  If you laugh out loud and think it is worth the
while then look at the movie to catch the detailed skits.  My own opinion is
that Zoolander is a nightmare Saturday Night Live Skit that has gone an hour
and a half too long.  This movie suffers from it's lacks of variety.  For
example, I admits to putting off seeing the first Austin Powers movie,
because it was difficult to imagine getting more than a fifteen minute skit
around a super spy that is lost in the sixties.  However, the Powers film
did vary the skits in that it made fun of a variety topics and the sixties
throw back was only part of the entertainment.  However, back to the purpose
of that digression, the failure of Zoolander is that is stayed on a topic
that does not have over fifteen minutes worth of material.  It keeps showing
us over and over again  that male models are dumb and dumber.  In fact, Dumb
and Dumber is also a better movie than this one.  I say pass it up with a
rating of about 4.2, but if you love the trailer then you will likely have a
good time with this movie.
