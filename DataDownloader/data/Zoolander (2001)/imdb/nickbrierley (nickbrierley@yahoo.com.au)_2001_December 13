Zoolander is one of the funniest guys you'll ever see in a movie, and his
dad, from Seinfeld, is also a great guy. His voice, with the adding of
'Blue
Steel' (and also Magnum, the Derek Zoolander School for kids who can't read
good and want to do other stuff better, and Will Ferrel and Mugatu) make
Zoolander the comedy of the year!!!!
