2005_April 2 
Although I'm not the biggest of Ben Stiller fans, I've enjoyed some of
his movies (The last one that I saw was 'Meet the Fockers', which
wasn't bad). And some of my friends, even though we don't exactly have
the same kind of humor all the time, recommended it to me... I gave it
a try and the only thing I can say about it is that I was very
disappointed...<br /><br />'Zoolander' gives us a glimpse of the world of the male supermodels.
Derek Zoolander is on his way down after three years of continuously
winning the &quot;Male Model of the Year&quot; award. He has been beaten by the
hot newcomer Hansel and starts searching for a new meaning in his life,
because he wants to give up modeling. But exactly now, the biggest of
all fashion tycoons, called Mugatu, wants him in his show... at least
that's what they all think. In reality Zoolander will have to kill the
new Malaysian Prime Minister on his visit to New York, so that cheap
child labor is still available for Mugatu's fashion producing. But a
smart and beautiful journalist finds out the truth and will try to stop
Zoolander...<br /><br />It's probably me, but in this entire movie there was only one moment
that made me laugh out loud. For the rest of the time this movie only
annoyed me. There really wasn't much that appealed to me in this movie
and I had the feeling that they only wanted to make this movie more
interesting by adding some stars or famous people like David Bowie,
Lenny Kravitz, Donald Trump, Tommy Hilfiger, Paris Hilton, Heidi Klum
and many many more. The acting from Stiller is the same as always, so
you exactly know what to expect, but the story of the movie doesn't
make too much sense and didn't do it for me. I give this movie only a
2/10. I'm sure many will love it, but I certainly didn't.
