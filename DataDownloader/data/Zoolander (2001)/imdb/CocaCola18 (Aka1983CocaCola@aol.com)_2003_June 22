This film is certainly not everybodies cup of tea! Lots and lots of people
will loath this film in a big ass kind of way! But I loved Zoolander very
much! I love Ben Stiller films very much and when he combines his talents
with his family, friends and icons doing Stiller a favor it makes Zoolander
a better movie to watch!<br /><br />Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson basically poke fun (in a nice way) towards the
direction of the fashion industry.<br /><br />The story is great all be it controversial!<br /><br />I beg people to watch this for what it is... a comedy! It's not trying to be
interlectual or trying to win an academy award...it's trying to make
audiences laugh... and it does!<br /><br />FOR WHAT IT IS &amp; MAKING ME LAUGH<br /><br />8/10
