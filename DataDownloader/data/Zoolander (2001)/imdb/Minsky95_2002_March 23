This movie was so funny.  It was really stupid, but those are the funniest
right?  Ben Stiller plays a funny role as a famouse male model.  I thought
it was going to be a spoof of a James Bond type of film, but I was wrong. 
Some parts of the movie were absolutely halarious and there were a lot of
scenes that I thought Oh brother!  But this film was fun and worth
watching.
