Some of the best comedies don't have what one would call intelligent humor
(perfect example: The Three Stooges).  I love intelligent humor as much as
anyone, but its a lot more fun to laugh out loud with friends over the
stupidest little things than have a quaint chuckle alone at irony.  This is
why the world needs films like &quot;Zoolander&quot;.<br /><br />Most stupid comedies of late have been just that - stupid, weighed down by
bad toilet and sex humor.  But here we have a comedy with a lead that takes
his stupidity in stride down the walkway, and its (unlike most stupid
comedies of late) really funny.  Ben Stiller (who also directed) is great as
Derek Zoolander, a male model who wows the fashion world with his trademark
brilliant look &quot;blue steel&quot;, and gives critics a headache with his
less-than-brilliant manners of speaking.  Stiller's intentional bad-acting
gives Zoolander an even greater degree of stupidness, in all his blunders
and absurdities; he really is THAT funny, especially in a &quot;did he just say
what I think he said?&quot; sort of way because he really is THAT stupid. <br /><br />The film doesn't have the greatest longevity, since it removes most of the
effect once you know what Zoolander will do or say next, and as the film
winds down he actually gets a little smarter (fear not! a smarter Zoolander
is still dumber than anyone you'll ever meet).  The most absurd moments,
including Zoolander as a merman, a fashion awards ceremony that begins
Zoolander's &quot;retirement&quot;, and a walk-off competition between Zoolander and
his biggest competition, extreme-sports-model/stoner Hansel (Owen Wilson)
refereed by David Bowie, are by far the film's most (only?) memorable
aspects, but as mentioned earlier, they're that absurd and that dumb that
they stick around for a while.  There is also some subtle intelligent parody
of the fashion industry and in-jokes that keep the film fresh for discussion
with friends past the memorable moment's expiration dates.<br /><br />This obviously doesn't appeal to everyone (people who don't like cliches in
their plots, for instance).  But to those that it does appeal to, its great
fun, especially after all those disappointing summer blockbusters.
