A very stupid male model, Zoolander (Ben Stiller) tries to find meaning
in his life while fighting a rival male model (Owen Wilson) and
unwittingly being used by an evil fashion designer (Will Ferrell).<br /><br />The jokes are funny--sometimes very funny. The movie really zips along
and there are tons of in jokes and countless cameos by celebrities (my
favorites were Winona Ryder and Billy Zane). Also Stiller and Wilson
are hilarious--but seeing them as top male models is a stretch (then
again, that might be part of the joke). Also Milla Jovovich is VERY
weird--and funny.<br /><br />But Ferrell is annoying and not funny at all; Christine Taylor
(Stillers real life wife) is beautiful but bland; Jerry Stiller and Jon
Voight act like they're drugged and there just isn't enough material
for a full length movie.<br /><br />Still, there are enough funny moments to make this worth a look.
