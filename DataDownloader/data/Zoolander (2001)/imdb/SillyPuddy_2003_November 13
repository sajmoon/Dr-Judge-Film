This was one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen.  It ranks
alongside Me Myself and Irene as one of the worst comedies by two of my
favorite comedians.  The only part that I found funny was the scene in the
Jeep to get Frappucinos.  After that there was nothing but a waste of time. 
No its not even stupid in a funny way its just boring.  A couple years ago I
overheard a guy say he found Corky Romano to be more watchable than
Zoolander and judging by his tone that wasn't meant as a compliment.  That
shows you how low this film is.
