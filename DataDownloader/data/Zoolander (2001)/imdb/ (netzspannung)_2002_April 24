And I desperately hope it will stay that way. Apart from a maximum of
about
three or four funny ideas this cineastic disaster has accomplished
nothing.
The story is weak, the actors are weak, or making an effort on acting
weak.
And I do not wish to give a comment on the dialogues, for I am sure in
return I would be excluded from this site. I respect everybody who can
cope
with that type of humour, I failed.
