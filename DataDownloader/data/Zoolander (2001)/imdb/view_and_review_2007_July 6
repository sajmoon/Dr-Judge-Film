&quot;Zoolander&quot; is probably Ben Stiller&#39;s silliest endeavor. I found it
quite amusing, but its silliness did get to me at times. It&#39;s an
enjoyable movie in a juvenile, sophomoric kind of way. You obviously
can&#39;t take Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller), or any of his male model
friends, seriously. And you especially can&#39;t take Hansel (Owen Wilson)
seriously when you&#39;re staring at that huge sniffer on his face.<br /><br />It is a fun movie with a fair amount of laughable parts. Will Farrell
does an excellent job as Mugato and David Duchovny&#39;s cameo is very
amusing. Don&#39;t expect much from this movie in terms of plot or logic
and you can have yourself a good time.
