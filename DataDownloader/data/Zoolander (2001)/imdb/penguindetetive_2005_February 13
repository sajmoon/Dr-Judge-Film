There's a movie made in Hong Kong with some of it's scenes directly
ripped off from Zoolander, the walk-off for example. The movie is
called Wo Yao Zuo Model. In it the main character, Mandom, gets stabbed
thrice. He also lives with model friends, named Freedom and Condom,
respectively. They are the Dom's Dom-Dom! Regard this movie, watch it
if you must, it's good. There are the crab walking models and many
more. Mandom has to protect his right as the hottest model from
Fantasy, whose agent was formerly Mandom's All-in-one. They have to win
the king Model Jersey, which is the quintessential disco suit<br /><br />&quot;Any items!&quot;
