I have nothing at all against goofball comedy.  I watch Saturday Night<br /><br />Live and I've seen films like Austin Powers and Spinal Tap and Strange<br /><br />Brew numerous times.  I wasn't expecting anything deep or intelligent, I<br /><br />was simply expecting some laughs.  This film didn't deliver.  It wasn't<br /><br />funny at all, and since that is all it aspired to, the movie was a<br /><br />complete and utter failure.  Probably the worst movie I've seen all<br /><br />year. Don't waste your time and money.
