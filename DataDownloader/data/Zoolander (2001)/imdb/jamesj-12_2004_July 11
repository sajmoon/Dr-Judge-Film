What I thought was going to be a clever poke in the eye at the male
modeling industry, all I got was a feeble austin powers rip off with a
sickly sweet &quot;message&quot;, damn Hollywood!<br /><br />The script, direction, performances was horrible.<br /><br />OK there was some funny jokes, but no way near as many as required to
fill a full feature film....and it looked so expensive,
hmmmmmm...someone has money to burn.<br /><br />Its a pity Stiller does have comedic talent, maybe next time he
shouldn't direct himself...as with results it was pretty dreary.<br /><br />Don't talk to about Owen &quot;overrated&quot; Wilson.<br /><br />Avoid. Unless you want to pay for just a few giggles!!!
