Ben Stiller takes the crack at spoofing the model world in this film
version where he plays Derek Zoolander, one of the top male models.
Owen Wilson also plays his rival. Derek&#39;s not bright at all and it
should come as no surprise. Will Ferrell has a supporting role as the
man who is set to kill the prime minister of Malaysia using a
brainwashed Zoolander. Anyway, it&#39;s reminiscent of the Manchurian
Candidate. Christine Taylor from the Brady Bunch films and Wedding
Singer, plays a reporter. She really is quite identical to Maureen
McCormick and could be her daughter. Ben&#39;s dad, Jerry Stiller, is also
in the film as manager Holstein and his mother, Anne Meara, has a
cameo. It&#39;s quite hilarious at times and downright silly. Jon Voigt
plays Derek&#39;s hard-working blue collar father who is ashamed of his
son&#39;s chosen career.
