&quot;I&#39;m sorry that us models made you feel bad about yourself and throw
up.&quot; Ben stiller stars in this extremely funny comedy. He plays a dumb
and arrogant male model (like most of them are in real life). His
over-exaggerated character is just hysterical.<br /><br />Its light hearted story and star studded cast draws me closer to this
film. Its written extremely well and its a movie of constant stupid
gags.<br /><br />This is definitely one of stiller&#39;s funniest films, Dare i say as good
as Dodgeball?. For memorable gags definitely.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a film you can just sit back, watch and enjoy.
Although not an epic masterpiece i would recommend it to anyone 6/10
