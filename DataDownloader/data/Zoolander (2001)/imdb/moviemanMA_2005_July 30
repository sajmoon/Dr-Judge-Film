Everyone has seen a male model before whether it's on the side of a
bus, in a magazine, or on TV. They are the icons of glamour, good
looks, and power. They have the power to persuade a person to buy a
product. But what really goes on in the life of a male model? Well,
this movie probably gives the most ridiculous answer...but it doesn't
matter.<br /><br />Zoolander is about a male model named Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller),
who is famous for his looks called Blue Steel, Ferrari, and his best
kept secret...Magnum. All together they are the same look; sunken
cheeks, puckered lips, and eyes that could look through walls. Derek is
on top of the modeling world, winning awards, getting the best
designers, and not knowing what is going on. His world and the entire
modeling scene are about to be rocked by the rising star Hansel (Owen
Wilson) who is now considered the top model over Derek. Derek doesn't
realize this until it's much too late.<br /><br />Behind these heroes of the runway are the designers like Maury
Ballstein (Jerry Stiller) and Mugatu (Will Ferrell). In wake of Derek's
model friend's dreadful gasoline fight that went wrong, Derek has
retired. Mugatu's plan is to trick Derek into modeling for his new line
of clothing and at the same time be brainwashed into killing the
Malaysian Prime Minister because he has closed down Mugatu's child
labor factory. Derek is torn between modeling and helping a beautiful
reporter named Matilda (Christine Taylor) get her story on Mugatu and
working for Mugatu to get back at Hansel.<br /><br />The movie is very entertaining with all of it's characters and
storyline. Stiller is priceless as the 'no so bright' Zoolander and his
performance is complimented by Wilson and Ferrell. Of course Ben brings
all of his friends into the movie. Wilson and Ferrell have parts and as
does buddy Vince Vaughn as his brother. This group of comedy kings have
been making movies together for a while now and the hits just keep on
coming. With other members of the &quot;Laugh Pack&quot; here and there (like
Luke Wilson), their movies will always keep the laughs coming.<br /><br />Zoolander is a great movie to watch anytime. It really does make you
laugh. Watching Stiller, Willson, and Ferrell work their magic is a
wonderful thing. Just like his father, Ben is a laugh riot. His father
Jerry also holds his own in this film. Stiller delivers once again. All
together, Zoolander walks the walk and talks the talk.
