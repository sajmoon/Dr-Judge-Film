This movie is so funny. But it's not just stupid physical comedy. It's
the smartest jokes ever. Eventually those of you slow people are not
gonna get them all. <br /><br />Anybody doesn't think this movie is funny well well there isn't much to
say to you. God bless you. That means you aren't very sharp person
after all...<br /><br />I mean just listening to the accent, Ben Stiller developed for this
movie is worth the admission.<br /><br />Jokes will come so fast and they are so stupid. So stupid is the
hardest to create kind of humors. Because very very often &quot;supposed to
be too stupid&quot; jokes become &quot;stupid jokes&quot; And we've seen that too many
times.
