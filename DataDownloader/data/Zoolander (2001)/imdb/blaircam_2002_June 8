This film reminded me of Mystery Men - another Stiller
film.
It was a clever concept and had some very funny and intelligent parts in it
- but the whole thing didn't quite convert a clever idea into a killer
movie.
Unlike Mystery Men, Zoolander does have the advantage of ending before all
the laughs run out.
I think it is a light-hearted movie that just about achieves its aims -
silly fun for just under 1 1/2 hours.
My vote a solid 6/10
