I can and have watched Zoolander over and over again. I still laugh every
time. The DVD includes lots of great extras like the two previous
Zoolander
skits. Zoolander is a well-crafted, highly thought out masterpiece of
brilliant stupidity. Great cast, funny plot, and enough quirkiness to even
give it a slight cult-film flavor. Definitely one of my favorite
movies.
