2002_July 18 

For some Godforsaken reason I rented this film recently and have to tell
you, it is the biggest piece-O'-dung (other than Popeye) that I have ever
seen. I was shocked because I have been a great fan of Ben Stiller since
the
days of his TV show. This film was SOOO bad that, had I not been home, I
would have walked out on it. This is yet another clear example that when
you
try to  take a dumb bit from a show&#150;maybe something that was funny for
three
minutes, ONCE&#150;and  then you try to make a feature film out of it, you are
doomed to fail.
