<br /><br />Ever wondered what it was like to be a male model? Well, watching
Zoolander probably isn't going to give you any accurate representation of
what being a male model is really like but it's definitely a hilarious
spoof
on modeling and fashion industry.  Zoolander relies heavily on the
stereotypes of self-absorbed male models depicting them as airheads with
their senses often limited to strictly fashion. I recommend you completely
disregard Stiller's previous comedies Something About Mary, Meet the
Parents, and Along Came Polly when approaching this film as it strays from
his usual `boyfriend with bad luck who gets into hilariously embarrassing
situations' style comedy. His role this film shows character diversity in
Stiller not seen in his past films and it works.<br /><br />The sheer stupidity of the main characters Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller)
and rival male model Hansel (Owen Wilson) are the primary sources of the
genuine laughs found in Zoolander. Set in modern day New York City, the
plot
revolves around a sinister fashion designer named Mugatu (Will Ferrell)
and
his plot to brainwash male model Derek Zoolander to kill the Prime
Minister
of Malaysia.  The Prime Minister harms Mugatu's clothing factories (run by
children) by imposing child labor laws, angering Mugatu and other fashion
designers. Although the plot is far-fetched it never tries to be taken any
more seriously than a comic book. Once you see the remarks and reactions
of
the two main characters it's impossible to take seriously and often funny.
One example of the hilarious stupidity in this movie: Early on in the
movie
there is a `Male Model of the Year' awards ceremony Zoolander, being
accustomed to winning the award several years in a row runs to the stage
despite the fact Hansel's name had been announced to accept the award.
Zoolander proceeds to give his cocky award speech when he the host taps
his
shoulder and points to Hansel standing behind him. Zoolander is struck
with
disbelief and it makes for a truly funny scene. There isn't much romance
in
this film but there is a little between a reporter named Matilda
(Christina
Applegate) and Zoolander but it's never really explored in the film and
most
of its referred to with humor. Picture Zoolander as a feature-length
Saturday Night Live skit and you should know what kind of humor to
expect.<br /><br />As I said before to enjoy this movie you can't take it seriously because
you will take it as it was not intended.  This was a movie that caught me
by
surprise, I didn't think I'd like it and thought of myself as being
`dragged' to see it but was very happy with after watching.  I never
thought
I'd be interested in seeing something about a male model (because I have
no
interest on the subject) but modeling is just what it makes fun of.
Zoolander definitely achieves what it sets out to do and doesn't try to
take
itself seriously at all.  Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are compliment each
others roles very well and are extremely funny together.<br /><br />Bottom Line- 7.5 out of 10: Better than `fair' but not great, lots of
laughs
to be had but it relies on the same `stupid' humor the entire movie. Even
though the humor can be repetitive at times, it still managed to be funny
for the most part throughout the movie. I consider it a solid comedy worth
renting for those seeking laughter.
