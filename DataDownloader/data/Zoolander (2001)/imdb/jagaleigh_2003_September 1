This movie was completely silly and great. I really didn't know if it would
even be good in a campy way, but it really was. Ben Stiller is on top of his
game throughout the film, and the rest of the cast is just as brilliant (I
heart Will Farrell).<br /><br />I loved all the cameos, I loved the writing, I loved that I rented it. You
will be, too. SO GO RENT IT. heh.
