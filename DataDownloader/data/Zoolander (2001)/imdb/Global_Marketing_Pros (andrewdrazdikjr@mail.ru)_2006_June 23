Mission Impossible Agent Philps, who&#39;s got a look alike who sang Secret
Agent Man for me at the Four Points Sheraton in Greensburg,
Pennsylvania. Boy they look alike, a lot. I should have got his name
and he could maybe be a good acting double. Or, then again I should
have got the name of the 5&#39;5&quot; Latino standing under the lamp post with
the fur on top of it. Maybe some kind of funny joke, like Lucifer or
something.<br /><br />Ben Stiller seems to play the same role as in Meet the Parents,
Something About Mary, and Starsky and Hutch. Ben seems like the kind of
Jew who would miss breaking the glass at his own wedding and trip in
process knocking over the altar. Maybe this movie is about how careers
collide and one profession brings out the best or worst in the people
you work with. Brain washing is a serious business associated with
propaganda like the use of this movie&#39;s medium FILM. I do not think
world leaders like Japan&#39;s Kozumi, Britian&#39;s Tony Blair, or the United
States of America&#39;s George Bush would approve of turning this medium
for Zoolander and its objective into a reality. Thank God Ben Stiller
is just an actor, but the screen writers God knows how they conceive
the originality of this intellectual property.
