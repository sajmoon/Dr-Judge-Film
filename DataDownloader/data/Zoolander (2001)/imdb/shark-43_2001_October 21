I was very disappointed with ZOOLANDER. I like Ben Stiller's work, but the
movie really just had the same joke over and over; male models are dumb and
pop culture is transparent. And by trying to hang some MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE
plotline around such a flimsy movie idea to begin with, well it sunk fast.
Yes, there are some laughs and even some clever scenes, but Derek Zoolander
is such a dim, sullen lead character all it does is remind you whatan
amazing feat AUSTIN POWERS really was. Thismovie wanted to try and pull off
a satricial bullseye like that film but I feel it really missed it's mark
and one of thebig problems was that Stiller decided to direct it himself.
The man is not a director. He is a fine actor, a good writer, but his three
movies (REALITY BITES, CABLE GUY and now this) well they are patchy messes
with no real rhythm or sense of honesty to them. As an actor, Stiller has
never been better than in FLIRTING WITH DISASTER. But, Zoolander is like the
lead - all one look, nothing else. BLAH!!!
