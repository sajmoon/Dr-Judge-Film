2004_August 7 

I typically don't comment on movies, but after reading the last review,
I feel obligated to defend my dearest Derek. Every moment of this film
is hysterical, and it is the single most quotable movie of all time.
Stiller and Wilson play off of each other brilliantly, and Will Ferrell
steals every scene he's in. If you want to watch a stupid comedy a la
Dumb and Dumber or Old School, this is THE PERFECT movie. It isn't as
intellectual as a Wes Anderson or Christopher Guest movie, but as
someone who normally dislikes stupid gross-out Ben Stiller comedies, I
can vouch for this one. If I could, I would watch Zoolander all daiye.
D-A-I-Y-E. Daiye.
