Ben Stiller's 'Zoolander' is supposedly a stinging satire on the world
of fashion. But the picture is creates is so over the top, and the plot
so exaggeratedly stupid, that it fails to hit any real targets: there's
also an extremely large quantity of product placement to endure.
However, while it might not be satire, it is full of a great string of
gags about stupid people. The truth is that many of these are just damn
funny, and in a comedy, that's arguably the most important thing. As a
director, Stiller is no genius, and there are some clunky moments with
the camera-work and music; and the acting (of Stiller and others) is
also pretty basic. This doesn't mean you won't laugh.
