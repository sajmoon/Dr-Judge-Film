I thought this movie was seriously funny.  Before I saw it, I was making
fun
of anyone who even mentioned seeing it.  I don't think this movie sounds
funny or the previews make it look funny, but this movie proves to be
really
good.<br /><br />The kind of humor in this movie is very clever, dumb humor.  A lot of
people
wouldn't catch some of the really subtle jokes, but they are certainly
there.  This movie is better every time I watch it.  If you like movies
that
get better every time because you pick out even more, you will like this
movie.
