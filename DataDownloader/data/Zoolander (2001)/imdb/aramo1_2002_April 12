Based on R1 DVD<br /><br />If Zoolander was the work of a bunch of no-names on a limited budget it
might be excused as a valent first attempt, that of course is far from the
case. Thirteen year olds might go for this stuff - some of them -
maybe.<br /><br />At times it is painful to watch Stiller and Wilson go thru a poor parody
of
the Oprah Show (Why are you nasty to me), the film has it's moments but
they
are few and far between.<br /><br />4/10
