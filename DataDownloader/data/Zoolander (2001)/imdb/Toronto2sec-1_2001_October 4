Ben Stiller does a fine job in comedy. But playing a male-model is not his
field, This movie would have worked out great with the likes of Jim Carrey.
But none the less it works. Derek Zoolander, is about to kill the prime
minister of Asia &lt;~~ or something close to it. And has to be stopped to
think about this by friends/foe. Friends, Owen Wilson. Foes, Jerry Stiller
and Will Ferrel.<br /><br />After his friends all get killed in a &quot;little&quot; gasoline fight, and attempt
to smoke during it, blow up. So Zoolander desides to retire and make a new
life, But Mugatu (Will Ferrel) Thinks differently.<br /><br />Out of 10-7.1
