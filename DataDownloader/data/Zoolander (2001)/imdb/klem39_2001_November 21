Jacky chan's Rush Hour 2 having finished when we got to the cinema we
decided on Zoolander it being a comedy.  Hour and half later and half
asleep
we exited to sunshine.  A comic style film with lots of color and &quot;in&quot;
references and a scattering of &quot;famous&quot; people failed to raise even a
titter
from the small crowd
