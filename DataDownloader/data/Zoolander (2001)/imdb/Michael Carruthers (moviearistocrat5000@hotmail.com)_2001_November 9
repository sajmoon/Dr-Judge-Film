ZOOLANDER (2001)
Rating: 9/10<br /><br />Some people will say this is a one-joke movie, some will say this is a plain
stupid movie and others will even say this is one of the worst movies of the
year. But hopefully not many. I really don't see how anyone could dislike
this movie, it is vibrant, happy, full of story, the jokes are unbelievable
and I embarrassed myself by laughing so loud and the film actually has
intelligence, and isn't one of those dumb-fun comedies. Take the scene in
the graveyard with the hand model, it tells us that all world leaders that
were assassinated were actually killed by models &#150; an absurd point of view,
I know, but it actually works, and that is one of the movies high-points.
However absurd or stupid it may be, it actually gives explanations as to
what is happening with the gags and story twists. What really kicks serious
ass with Zoolander is not the intelligence it has, but the wide range of
opportunity it has with its jokes. Whenever it has the chance for a joke, it
goes for it. Some particularly funny scenes were when Derek Zoolander was
getting brainwashed and the very last scene had me in fits. The movie is
awesome as a spoof on movies that are too dramatic and male models that take
themselves too seriously. Zoolander may not have as drama as the subject its
spoofing, but it doesn't need it. The jokes are all there and we don't want
any serious parts &#150; we just want the movie to keep on rolling with its
crack-ups. I'm sure many people will diss this movie, but I found it very
hard to find a fault in it, and I really enjoyed myself. I expected much
less, but got some of the best entertainment out of a movie in ages.
Zoolander is a great flick, and gives a new meaning to the world `laugh.'
See it now!
