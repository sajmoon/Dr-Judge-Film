Since I had heard that Zoolander is a film for people who liked Austin
Powers I had to see it. Bit of a disappointment, though. It *is* rather
funny, but not as funny and entertaining as I expected. There are only one
or two hilarious scenes, the rest of the funny scenes are only giggles or
smiles. Owen Wilson was great though, and Ben Stiller was quite funny.
