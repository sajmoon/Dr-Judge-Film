I found this one of the most stupid films I have ever seen, and I
needed my wife to tickle me in order to be able to laugh while watching
it. The film was so bad that my wife actually got angry in the middle
of it, asking how it was possible that this film was ever produced.<br /><br />I have nothing against Ben Stiller, in fact I think he is one of the
most brilliant comedy-actors around, but in this film he not only
misses the target, he shoots blanks!<br /><br />Maybe it's just me not being able to relate to the humor the film is
built around, but on the other hand I am a guy that laughs fairly easy,
and understands most jokes I see on screen. Just not with this film. It
could be me that is wrong, but I choose to say that it is this film and
not me there is something wrong with!<br /><br />1/10
