I don't understand how anyone could rate zoolander in such a negative
manner! Will Farrel's performance was absolutely hilarious. I could've
done
without Milla Jovavich's abnoxious acting and struggling performance. But
to
rate this as a below average movie is a TRAVISTY! Ben Stiller is fabulous
and Owen Wilson is beautiful and Will Farrel is the bomb and anyone who
says
differently needs to reevaluate their taste in comedies!
