I can not believe somebody would make a movie like this one. To begin
with, Stiller is probably the worst comediant that has ever lived, he
truly, truly sucks big time, though, not all of his movies are
horrible. I&#39;m saying this to be clear about the fact that this is not a
bad review because I have a personal problem with Stiller, aside from
that, this particular movie lacks creativity, lacks humor, has
absolutely no script what so ever, the acting is unbelievably bad and
has one of the worst secuences in cinema history, which is the so
called &quot;modeling duel&quot;. I&#39;m simply shocked and amazed about how little
something can offer and still become a hit.
