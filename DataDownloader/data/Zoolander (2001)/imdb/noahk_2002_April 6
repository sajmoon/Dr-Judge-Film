2002_April 6 

This is one of the silliest and lightest films you might ever see.  Not
nearly as funny as the VH-1 skits that inspired it (included on the DVD), at
less than an hour and a half, it plays like they carried the joke too long. 
Still, it is certainly amusing-- it's hard not to enjoy Ben Stiller
(although I would have expected better from him) and Owen Wilson in their
roles and it's easy to see that everyone involved is having fun.  Overall, a
5 out of 10- worth considering as a rental.
