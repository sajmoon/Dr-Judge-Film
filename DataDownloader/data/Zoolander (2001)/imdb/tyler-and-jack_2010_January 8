Zoolander is directed by Ben Stiller and based on a character he
created, a vain and extremely dim male model who just happens to be THE
top male model in the world.<br /><br />The movie shows us that some pesky people are trying to stop the poor
child workers of the world being allowed to do what the love doing,
make ridiculously expensive clothes for ridiculously meagre wages, and
so top designer Mugatu (played by Will Ferrell) comes up with a
brilliant, diabolical scheme. It involves Derek Zoolander (Stiller on
hilarious form), a tune from Frankie Goes To Hollywood and someone
very, very important who is cramping the style of certain fashion
designers (pun intended). Then there&#x27;s Zoolander&#x27;s public, ongoing feud
with main rival Hansel (Owen Wilson, also hilarious) and his rather
public ribbing by journalist Matilda Jeffries (Christine Taylor) in
TIME magazine. How can all this happen at once to someone so obviously
really, really good looking? <br /><br />With a hilariously stupid script, numerous fun cameos and a great
supporting cast including the likes of Milla Jovovich, Jerry Stiller,
Jon Voight and David Duchovny this movie should please fans of dumb
comedy. Yes, models are an easy target but that doesn&#x27;t matter when the
jokes come as thick and fast as this lot do. Whether it&#x27;s Zoolander&#x27;s
anger as he misunderstands the concept of a scale model or his attempt
at re-bonding with his estranged father, no scene is far away from a
real laugh out loud moment.<br /><br />Stiller as a director is just as competent as Stiller as an actor and
perfectly matches the flashy, shallow lifestyle to the flashy, shallow
characters portrayed. He also gets a decent soundtrack throughout and
there&#x27;s a great David Bowie appearance (though, shock, horror, that may
be pipped to the post by the great Billy Zane moment).<br /><br />Great fun. If you don&#x27;t like Stiller then this is unlikely to win you
round but if you do enjoy his comedy style then this is up there with
the best of his laugh-inducing stuff.<br /><br />See this if you like: Dodgeball, Showgirls, The Heartbreak Kid.
