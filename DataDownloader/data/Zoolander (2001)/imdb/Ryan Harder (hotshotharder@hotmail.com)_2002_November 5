Zoolander is a little goofy, a little silly and filled with laughs but if
you're a fan of goofy movies then this one's for you. We see Derek
Zoolander, he's not all that bright and he's a little gullible but if he was
smart, then it would take away the whole plot of the show, we see he's
brainwashed to kill the newly elected prime-minister of Malaysia but will he
do it?, the movie also pokes fun at modelling and celebrities which make the
film so amusing, so if goofy movies are your type then you should watch this
goofball movie, 6 out of 8
