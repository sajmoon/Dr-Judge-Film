Sorry to say, but this movie was the worst I have ever seen. I truly
laughed
about once or twice in the first 30min, after that I didn't even laugh
once,
the acting was pathetic, the plot was not that great.  I mean I had a
better
time watching previews. It was so bad that I had to leave for a cigarette
break for like 25 minutes, and when I came back, my 2 friends said that I
should of stayed there longer.  So my suggestion is don't rent this movie,
or buy it, because it's a waste of money.
