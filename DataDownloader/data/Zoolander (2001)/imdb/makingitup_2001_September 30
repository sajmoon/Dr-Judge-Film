I'm a big Ben Stiller fan, but this is awful. I can only suppose he was
hoping to build an Austin Powers-like franchise, but the aim is too low
and
the writing is not nearly clever enough. His dad is a funny man, too,  but
is miscast and Will Farrell is over the top, even for him. Owen Wilson
created the only believable character execution and he and Ben click in
their few scenes together. I'd recommend avoiding even the video of this
one, which is a real money-waster.
