I usually like most of Ben Stiller's films, but this just did not rate.  I
tried to laugh, but no sound came out.  Very disappointing.  I did like
all
the stars that were jammed packed into this movie.  The movie had Ben
Stiller's whole family in it (wife, father, and mother).  Let's hope he
does
better on the next movie.
