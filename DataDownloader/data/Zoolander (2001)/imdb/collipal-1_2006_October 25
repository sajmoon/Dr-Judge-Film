I thought that Zoolander was going to be a very mediocre comedy.But I
was very wrong.The movie is extremely funny and I could not stop
laughing with it.There are a lot of great cameos.I&#39;m not going to say
the people who make them to don&#39;t ruin the surprise.Ben Stiller is very
funny and he always makes me laugh.The movie works very well as a
satire to the fashion world.Zoolander is not the best movie in the
history of the cinema;but it made me laugh a lot and I had a great time
watching it.So,I recommend it if you wanna see a really funny
movie.Stiller shows he has a lot of talent for comedy.<br /><br />Rating:8
