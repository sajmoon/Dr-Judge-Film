This film is quite simply the finest comedy to come out of the US this
century. That's why it flopped there. Tut tut. Stiller and Wilson do
the original buddy stuff, playing out their ridiculous male models to
perfection, whilst the supporting cast are sensational. Jon Voight as
Derek's New Jersey coal mining father (you're dead to me boy, more dead
to me than your dead mother), Will Ferrel's bizarre but hilarious
fashion designer Jacobin Mugatu, creator of the piano key neck tie
(obey my dog!) and Jerry Stiller's track-suited, dwarfish agent
lothario with serious renal problems (ah, my prostate's flared up like
a honeydew) all combine to make a film with barely a laugh-free second.
Oh, and David Bowie's in it. I think, in all fairness, it's a case of
either getting it or not. Personally, I find a poodle in a wig,
pointless celebrity cameos and the phrase orange-mocha-frappucino
pant-wettingly funny. If you don't then please leave now and go watch
Starsky and Hutch like all the other cool kids. But know this: you are
a big fat faker. Put a cork in it Zane!
