This film is fun. It is just what many of us, who still seem to be a little
meloncholy since Sept. 11, need right now. Stiller, as usual, is great and
plays the amazingly stupid Derek Zoolander to perfection. The reason this
movie works is because it is soooooooooooo stupid. It makes no attempt to be
anything but ridiculous. Many people will hate this movie and I think it
will get a cult following of mainly Gen Xer's like myself, but if you just
except how inane it is suppose to be I think everyone will enjoy it. I
remember when the first Austin Powers came out how stupid everyone thought
it was and then it began to catch on around college campuses and high
schools and now look at it. I believe Zoolander may very well have the same
fate.
