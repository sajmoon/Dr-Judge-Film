I liked this movie. I can't stand all that fashion crap on TV and the E!
Channel. It was a real treat to see this movie spoof all of that phony
baloney. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are great and hilarious. The film is
not just a satire, though. It contains some scatological humor and many
other forms. I recommend you see this hilarious trek through the fashion
industry.
