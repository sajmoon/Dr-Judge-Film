for years i heard people talk about this movie and that its funny and
over the top and stupid...basically just a classic dumb funny movie.
well i finally got to watch this on TV in the holidays, it was on at
like 10 or 10:30 and i watched it with my cousin.<br /><br />this movie is basically dumb and stupid...but not in a bad way. does
that sound weird? anyways it definitely is a classic to remember.<br /><br />Ben Stiller plays Derek Zoolander who is a three time
male-model-of-the-year who has his look that he gives (which is the
same look, but don&#39;t tell him that) and he ends up losing to a hippy
style new male model, Hansel, played by Owen Wilson. after this loss
and a tragic death of three of his friends in a fight accident at a
gasoline station (somewhat disturbing) he decides to pursue higher
goals in life.<br /><br />&quot;i&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s more to life than being really, really,
ridiculously good looking&quot;.<br /><br />this movie follows his path of discovery and the trials in the way with
some pretty funny scenes. like Derek and Hansel&#39;s walk off judged by no
other than David Bowie himself.<br /><br />Will Ferrel playing as Mugatu (with freaky hair) adds to the stupidity
of this movie, as well as its strange story line.<br /><br />but this definitely is memorable and funny so i recommend to watch
this.
