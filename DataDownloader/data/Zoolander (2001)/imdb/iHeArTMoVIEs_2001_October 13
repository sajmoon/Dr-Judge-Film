Ok, This movie looked funny as hell in the previews. but if you wanted to
see the funny parts, you might as well have just sat at home and watched
the
previews, and it would've been FREE.  The only funny parts in it that
weren't in the previews was the gasoline fight and where he says
&quot;u-goog-aly&quot;.  And that WAS NOT worth the $6.50.
