Definitely do not go to see this film if you don't like so-called &quot;dumb
movies&quot;. Although even for these people it has it moments, you most likely
will not enjoy it.<br /><br />If you're looking for a really funny film, to watch and unwind to,
definitely watch it. The jokes are brilliant, even though it does slow down
in a few parts, but overall the pace is good.<br /><br />Ben Stiller *is* Zoolander.
