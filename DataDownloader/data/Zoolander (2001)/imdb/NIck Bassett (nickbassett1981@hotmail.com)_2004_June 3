Zoolander is not comedy perfection, nor is it a total waste of space.
In fact it comes in just above average because when it is funny, it is
laugh out loud funny. Not surprisingly, when you have Ben Stiller
turning in another great performance! He is a bit of a master at this
type of role though and some may say that it gets tiring seeing the
same kind of humour being churned out again and again. People were
turning against Jim Carrey and Robin WIlliams for the same comedy
showcases again and again before they defied expectations and went
against the grain. It shows that they can do more than just comedy and
gain a betetr critical reception for it!! Anyway back to the subject -
Zoolander is a little reminiscent of the Austin POwers movies with its
over the top set pieces and pantomimic villains however it works when
the storyline is just as ridiculous!<br /><br />Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, a male model who's star is falling
whilst OWen Wilson (Stiller's regular sidekick) rises to international
fame as Hansel, the stealer of Zoolander's Male MOdel OF The Year
crown. They are both portrayed as stupid himbos who have to rely on the
brains of a female Time Magazine reporter when Zoolander is brainwashed
to kill the Malaysian prime minister by a villainous fashion designer
(Will Ferrell, deliciously camp). <br /><br />Part of the joy of this film is watching out for the cameo
appearances..Jon Voight, Winona Ryder and Builly Zane have larger roles
whilst you can also see Victoria BEckham, Paris HIlton on the down
side!! The scene when Zoolanders mermaid advert is screened in a miners
village with his dad and brothers [present is priceless and probably my
favourite part of the film but also look out for the calendar and the
MAgnum...You will be trying hard not to laugh..<br /><br />Give it a go. Great performances, lively show pieces, a good soundtrack
and it aint exactly a long film film - 80 minutes! whats wrong with a
bit of familiarity now and again anyway?
