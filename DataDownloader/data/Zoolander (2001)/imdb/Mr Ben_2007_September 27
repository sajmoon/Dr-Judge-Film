2007_September 27 
It may have taken a while but finally, I get to review a film with a
title beginning with the letter &#x27;Z&#x27;. And seeing as period action pieces
rarely get my blood pumping, I was always likely to watch this film
before I sat myself in front of &#x22;Zulu&#x22;. To be honest, I was expecting
great things from this after hearing from others how good it was and it
was funny enough, I suppose. Like another hugely-hyped comedy &#x22;Nacho
Libre&#x22;, I just felt like I was missing the joke though the world of
fashion and male modelling is an easier target than Mexican wrestling
monks.<br /><br />Ben Stiller directs, writes and stars as Derek Zoolander, international
male-model super-god and winner of the VH1&#x27;s Male Model Of The Year
award for the last three years. When he is surprisingly beaten to the
title by equally good-looking bohemian hippie Hansel (Owen Wilson),
Derek&#x27;s world falls apart and he announces his retirement. But after
being picked up to launch the latest collection by freakish designer
Mugatu (Will Ferrell) and with the support of his agent (Jerry
Stiller), Derek prepares to re-launch himself into modelling
super-stardom. But a plucky journalist (Christine Taylor) discovers a
vast conspiracy to assassinate the Prime Minister of Malaysia with
Derek as the unlikely killer...<br /><br />Soft targets they may be but the fashion world is gloriously send up by
Stiller et al and seemingly with their blessing, judging by the vast
number of cameos in this film. Everyone from Donald Trump to the Spice
Girls (betraying the film&#x27;s age) appear somewhere in &#x22;Zoolander&#x22;, a
character Stiller has clearly been developing for many years. He looks
like he is having real fun as well he might - damn near all his family
are also involved! The problem is, while Stiller easily has the best
lines and scenes, the rest of the cast look either bored or confused.
Jovovich is wasted as the hit-man / henchman and Duchnovny is
hopelessly miscast in his cameo. And while the endless parade of cameo
stars maintain a modicum of interest, the story stop-starts its way to
the inevitable conclusion. Zoolander is a superb creation but this film
is weakly scripted, a fact neatly illustrated by it&#x27;s
blink-and-you&#x27;ll-miss-it duration.<br /><br />&#x22;Zoolander&#x22; is not a bad film but I just feel that the character is
best suited to a sketch show like &#x22;Saturday Night Live&#x22; (where I
believe the character originated). To be honest, I can&#x27;t believe so
many people rave about it but maybe I&#x27;m in the minority. But who cares
- I still maintain this is an unpolished gem that, with a better
script, might have done to the fashion industry what &#x22;Supersize Me&#x22; did
to McDonalds. But it&#x27;s just too sporadic and down-right freaky at times
to be a real classic. I think you&#x27;ll either love it or hate it.
Personally, I&#x27;d stick with &#x22;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&#x22; which is
still Stiller&#x27;s best film. Now, all I have to do is watch
&#x22;Quadrophenia&#x22; and I&#x27;ve completed the alphabet...
