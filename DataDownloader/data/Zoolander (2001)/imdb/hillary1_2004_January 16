This is actually a pretty funny movie, and noticeably absent the gross-out
humor so much a part of Ben Stiller films. Will Ferrell is priceless,
especially that last scene on the runway, and there are lots of good one
liners. The plot is weak for sure but the characters and dialogue make up
for it. I recommend it!
