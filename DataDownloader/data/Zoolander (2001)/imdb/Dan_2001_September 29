Most will disagree, but I think that this was the funniest movie ever.
Those others, however, will not dislike it, they will also think it's funny,
but I'm sure there are also many out there who agree with my enthusiasm.
It was great to see Will Ferrell and Ben Stiller on screen together.  Never
before have I laughed so hard at a movie.  I was literally falling out of my
chair and holding my chest because it was in pain from laughing so much.  Go
see it.   You will be overflowing with laughter
