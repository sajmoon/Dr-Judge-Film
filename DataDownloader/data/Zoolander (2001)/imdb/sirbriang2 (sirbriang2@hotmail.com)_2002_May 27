let me say this up front: zoolander is a clever movie.  there is a
lot
of satire in this movie, and it looked like ben stiller and his
friends
had a lot of fun making it.  if you were one of ben stiller's
friends,
this movie would be hilarious to watch.  you'd get to say things
like
&quot;oh, man!  remember how many burritos i ate that night?  you can
TOTALLY
tell i have to take a dump in this scene!&quot;  and you'd laugh and smile
at
each other.<br /><br />HOWEVER, for the rest of us, zoolander is a bad, bad, bad, bad
movie
(and world).  while cleverly written, this is so unfunny, it hurts
my
teeth.  and they are not terribly sensitive, so it had to be
an
incredible shock of unfunny to get any reaction at all.  first off,
who
decided that ben stiller should carry a movie?  was i asleep during
that
meeting?  the man served his purpose in &quot;there's something about
mary.&quot;
he should have retired then.  i know, some of you are saying &quot;but
what
about 'meet the parents,' or 'zero effect' or 'mystery men'?  they
were
all right.&quot;  and to you i say this: i stand by my original
statement.
as far as attempted jokes to jokes i laughed at goes, zoolander's
batting average isn't high enough to legally drink in the
U.S.<br /><br />the other major problem with this movie was the number of celebrity
bit
roles.  now, i am not against cameos, especially in a film about
the
modeling industry.  but can't you get some talented cameos?
david
bowie, alright, i'll admit that he's cool.  but milla jovich,
stephen
dorff, jon voight, vince vaughn, david duchovny, jerry stiller,
and
others?  they would have been better off buying a dannon
talent-on-the-bottom yogurt.<br /><br />i need to go to a confessional and beg for forgiveness because
i
actually paid to see this.  and i'm not even catholic.  overall, i
would
have to say that my hatred for this movie is equal to that of &quot;the
doom
generation&quot; and &quot;battlefield earth,&quot; illustrious company,
indeed.
