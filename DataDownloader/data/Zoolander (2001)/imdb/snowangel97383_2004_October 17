I love this movie, I think it is one of his best movies.But then again
i think that most of his movies are awesome.The whole movie is a joke
and reminder of funny things to my family. We will quote a line and
then my mom, dad or brother will finish the line for me. This movie has
many good memories to recall and when I watch it I think of all the
good times my family and I had while watching it.I know that sounds
dumb, but ohh well.This is one of my favorite movies.One of the parts
that we find hilarious is when hansel and derek are doing the walk off,
they make the same faces and everything.I think that owen Wilson and
ben stiller work very well together.
