This movie is amazing. I have fun every time I watch this movie.
Everything about it is funny. It&#39;s almost indescribable how ridiculous
(ridiculous as in really really goofy/silly) Zoolander is. I&#39;m not big
on Ben Stiller&#39;s work. I disliked both &quot;Meet the&quot; films, and I didn&#39;t
like &quot;Dodgeball&quot;. But he was...amazing in this movie.<br /><br />This is what comedy should be all about. It&#39;s surely a movie that you
could quote on forever. And what really makes it unique is that if you
enjoy the jokes, and get a feel for the goofy atmosphere, you really
don&#39;t care about the story. In fact, you SHOULDN&#39;T care. Ben Stiller
shows that through his eyes as a director. <br /><br />It&#39;s very hard to find a decent/creative comedy these days. This film
is certainly underrated. I recommend this to anyone who wants a good
laugh!
