Oh my god! I don&#39;t remember seeing the most idiotic comedy in all my
life. In a good way, of course. When I started to watch it, I couldn&#39;t
expect it so brilliant. Frat pack really do their work, making us
laugh. Well, at least, make me laugh. Ben Stiller is just perfect for
roles of a kind, good heart idiots,Owen is there to support as always,
Christine Taylor is constantly showing that she becomes actress, not
just Ben&#39;s wife. Brilliant Vince Vaughn with his perfect sense of
comedy rhythm, in his short appearance. But this movie has something
that no movie before it. Amazing Will Ferrel as fashion magnate Mugatu,
so great, with his unbelievable hair, pet, clothes, job. Makin fun of
male models is something he can do just fine, along with his colleges.
A must-see comedy with many celebrities like Billy Zane, Fred
Durst,Stephen Dorff, David Bowie.... Mila Jovovich,of course
