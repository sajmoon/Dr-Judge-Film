2001_October 6 

This film is very well written.  It juxtaposes physical humor with biting
satire.  The multiple references to past films are a nice touch for the
sophisticated viewer.  The Kubrick 2001 parody is particularly funny.  My
only complaint would be the multiple product placements in the film, but I
guess it is a small price to pay for an all around good film.  The
cinematography is quite good with vibrant colors and excellent visuals.  I
would give this film 3 out of 4 only deducting 1 because of the annoying
advertisements.
