This is a wild, wacky and exceedingly good satire of the whole
crazy world of fashion. Zoolander is really a difficult story, I mean,
how do you make the audience feel for a lead character who is
supposed to be completely dumb? Some reviewers here think the
first 20 minutes is pretty slow, but seeing Derek get his ego
slammed is pretty funny itself, and the whole point of the first act
was to get you to like him. If you thought the rest of the film was
funny, well, the first 20 mins got the job done.<br /><br />Actually if you stop for a second and think about the whole idea that
someone like Derek can become the top supermodel in the world,
and it only makes the rest of the film even more funny.<br /><br />I won't give away the gags in the review. Just remember when you
watchh the film, let the jokes fly on, and if you don't catch every
single one, the story will bring you through one very well done
spoof. By the time you reach the climax of the film, with Derek
saving the day, you'll just be glad that you paid the dollars to Ben
and his team to make this genre of film.<br /><br />Watch this one. Its good. May Zoolander 2 be as good as the
original.
