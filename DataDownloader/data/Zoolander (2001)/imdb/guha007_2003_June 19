I don't know what everyone is complaining about. I have to admit the first
time I saw it I was less than impressed. But the movie grew on me on the
second viewing. I had a similar experience with 'Austin Powers: Int'l Man of
Mystery', which I think is wickedly funny. I can spot just about every Bond
reference.<br /><br />Here, Ferrell and Owen were particularly funny.<br /><br />This movie does not try and pretend to be anything other than a silly
comedy. And I think Stiller's comedic talents were perfectly showcased. I
just hope he doesn't go Hollywood and try to make a sequel.
