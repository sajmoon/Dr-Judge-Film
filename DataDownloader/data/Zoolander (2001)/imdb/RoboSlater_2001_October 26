Ben Stiller is one of America's best comedy writers.  Who else could take a
one-note plot and continuously transform it from one funny moment to a
completely different, funny moment? I was in stitches! It's a commentary on
modeling, our obsession with it, our making vapid models icons and
hero-substitutes, commercialism and how we collapse reality and fantasy
worlds.  Hilarious.
