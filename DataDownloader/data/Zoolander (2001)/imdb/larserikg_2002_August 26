Watching Zoolander is like listening to a retarded person telling a joke.
It's not 
funny, you feel embarrassed, you feel guilty for being embarrassed because
the 
poor guy is trying so hard to be funny.<br /><br />Ben Stiller obviously hasn't got a clue about directing. Or writing a
screenplay. 
Or acting -- at least when he is directing at the same
time.
My rating: 1/10.<br /><br />
