This movie has one big problem: the main actor(s). Whereas the idea of
making fun of the fashion industry isn't bad, and some parts are quite
nice, the film suffers from too many actors who only *think* they are
funny. Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller have worked together on a number of
films that I can only remember because they irritated me enough to be
noteworthy.<br /><br />Now, some people may think it really is funny to see Ben Stiller act
like a fool. Personally, I started focusing my attention on any of the
other actors (who were simply doing their job) whenever Ben Stiller got
screen time (which is about 99% of the movie). I did this
unintentionally for a while, until I noticed that I was hoping
Zoolander would somehow disappear. That's when I used the remote.
