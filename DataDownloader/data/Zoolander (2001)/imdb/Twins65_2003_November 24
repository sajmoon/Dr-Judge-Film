A full-length movie based on a character for a five minute spoof film Ben
Stiller created for a fashion awards show several years ago.  Does that
sound like something you want to watch all the way through?   Didn't think
so.  <br /><br />There are some occasional laughs (or were they smirks?) with the &quot;cameo
recognitions&quot;, like Farrell's character, Vince Vaughn still stuck in the
hometown mines, or Duchovny spoofing his old series as a &quot;spooked, washed up
hand model&quot;, but the humor just doesn't hold up over an hour and 40 minutes.
 Hell, it doesn't even hold up for 15 minutes.<br /><br />Recommended only for Ben Stiller fanatics and/or Victoria's Secret models
looking to unwind after a tough day of walking around with 45 pound angel
wings strapped to your back.
