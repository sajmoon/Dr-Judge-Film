I didn't watch this movie when it was in the theaters because I expected
just a more or less dull vehicle to promote Ben Stiller. But what a surprise
when I saw this film on video later on! Good acting, good tempo, good jokes,
good supporting roles .. and it all fits together and results in one of the
best comedies of the year. I still laugh when I think of the scene where Ben
Stiller and Owen Wilson spoof Kubrick's 2001 &quot;Dawn of mankind&quot;.<br /><br />Rent it or buy it and laugh!
