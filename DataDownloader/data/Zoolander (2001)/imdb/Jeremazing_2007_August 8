This movie is one of the best. Such simple and hilarious writing is
amazing in this movie. Ben Stiller is the smartest actor around. He
might not be the most serious, but when it comes to acting he knows
exactly what to do. With support from Owen Wilson, this movie is one of
the funniest movies I have ever seen. Anyone who doesn&#39;t like this
movie hasn&#39;t really seen it. Male modeling isn&#39;t something anyone ever
thinks about. I think it is amazing how they portray the male models in
this movie. With gasoline fights and fighting over what hair gel to
wear this movie tops them all. If you can remember anything from this
movie remember this: &quot;Merman Pop, MER-MAN!&quot;. Will Ferrel is also so
great in this movie. &quot;Relax Don&#39;t Do It.&quot;. That song gets stuck in my
head and I don&#39;t even know the words. If you are in a very silly mood
and you want to laugh at something stupid, don&#39;t watch Borat or
Jackass, watch the classic De-Rek Zoo-Lan-Derrr...Zoolander!
