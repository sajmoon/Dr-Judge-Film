2001_October 9 

I gave this movie a 9/10 for this reason, if you have seen the previews,
you
know what you are going to see. You are going to see a movie that is
exactly
the kind of humor that the preview TELLS and SHOWS you it contains. They
don't expect Oscars, and arent even trying for them. This movie is not to
be
taken seriously, its for FUN, people. The movie's main characters did
great
jobs, and had good charisma between them, there were tons of other actors
putting in small bits (some of which were amazingly funny, I laughed out
loud in a few parts, and I almost never do that). There were some truly
funny moments, moments I found much funnier than I thought the film would
be. When I told friends and family I saw it they all said, `You did?' when
I
said I liked it they said with even more incredulity, `You did?!' because
I
don't like certain kinds of stupid humor. I liked the Three Amigos, but
hated Austin Powers. Potty humor doesn't do it for me. But this movie was
surprisingly witty and funny without thinking it had to be disgusting to
be
humorous. There were a few parts I could have lived without, gladly, but
overall you get what you think you are going to get, and
more!
