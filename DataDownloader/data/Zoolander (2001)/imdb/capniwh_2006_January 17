Anyone who doesn't &quot;get&quot; this movie doesn't understand satire!
&quot;Zoolander&quot; is a HOOT and one of my favorite Stiller's (of course, I
have yet to see a Stiller that ISN'T a hoot).<br /><br />Derek Zoolander (Stiller) is the epitome of the stereotypical 80's male
model &#150; he's &quot;really really really good looking&quot; but just can't see
past the end of his perfectly formed nose. Hansel (Wilson), like all
the 90's up and coming male models, is known only by 1 name (because it
is vain to have more than one name) and is so totally centered from
navel gazing that his navel is ALL he can see. When the two worlds meet
at the &quot;Male Model of the Year&quot; awards, Zoolander is left wondering if
there is more to life than being &quot;really really really good looking&quot;
and tells his manager he wants to start a &quot;school for kids who can't
read&#133;.good&quot;. The irony and satire are gorgeous, and so are Stiller and
Wilson! How CAN it miss? <br /><br />Signed, Patiently Awaiting A New Stiller
