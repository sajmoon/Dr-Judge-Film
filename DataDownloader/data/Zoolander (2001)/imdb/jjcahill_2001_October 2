Well, it seemed like a funny story line, but this movie took WAY too long
getting funny, and then it was too little - too late.<br /><br />Sometimes I think I am too critical expecting them to get skits put
together
into a movie, but then I think, HEY they are calling it a movie, so where
is
it?<br /><br />If you liked the trailers then enjoy and stay home.  Your life will be
better for having missed this one.<br /><br />It was almost a movie and it had a couple of funny scenes.<br /><br />
