when you see somebody doing something that is so not funny that you are
embarrassed for them?  You'll be chronically cringy if you sit thru this
piece of garbage.  I dont think mere words can express just how bad this
is,
but unfunny, unclever, are a quick two.  How can a movie with both
Stillers,
Anne Meara and Wil Ferrell be this horrible??!!If you paid for it, Im
sorry,
if you rented it, dont watch it, if you are watching it now, for Gods sake
man, get up and get out of there.
