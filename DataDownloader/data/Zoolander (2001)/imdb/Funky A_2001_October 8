So, Zoolander is not the most intellectually dense movie you are likely to
see this year. So what? It doesn't try to be that. It is instead an
extremely funny movie starring Ben Stiller, one of the funniest comics
right
now. After the hilarious Meet the Parents, Stiller comes back for yet
another hilarious comedy. This time, he plays Derek Zoolander, a dumb male
model who is brainwashed to assassinate the Malaysian prime minister
because
he wants to put an end to child labor. Zoolander attacks with light(but
extremely funny) humor the superficial and exploitative world of fashion.
You will probably keep on wearing Nike shoes after seeing Zoolander but at
least the movie as a target. But what is really important is Stiller and
Owen Wilson, both absolutely hilarious as moronic male models who have to
save the president. All the jokes either make you laugh out loud or at
least
smile. And there are plenty of them. Zoolander also has a lot of excellent
cameos(including... DAVID BOWIE!!!... yeah!). As a parody of spy movies,
Zoolander sure beats the dissapointing sequel to Austin Powers and may even
top the first installement of Myers' James Bond spoof. I will have to watch
them alongside one another and see. So, Zoolander won't change your life.
So
what, it will make you laugh a lot... Sometimes, that is all a movie should
do.<br /><br />81%
