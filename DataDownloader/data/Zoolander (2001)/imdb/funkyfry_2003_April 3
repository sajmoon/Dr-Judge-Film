A pretty smart film that masquerades as a spoof of male fashion (who needed
to spoof that, anyway) but is really a satire of Western culture on some
levels.  On other levels, it's mostly straightforward physical comedy, but
there is enough visual quality and the actors are also good, so this is well
pulled off.  Stiller is over the top as the model who uncovers an
international cartel who use male models to assassinate world leaders (this
is all in the first 30 minutes, folks).  He appears in many scenes with his
father, and their chemistry is excellent.  Ferrell is excellent and also way
over the top as the cartel's lead muscle man/world famous designer.  There
were 2 really funny scenes I don't want to give away, but what really
cracked me up here was how straight Jon Voight played his character, and it
is his character if you know what I mean.  The movie never took a blink from
a straight approach to his &quot;I'm a rugged coal miner whose son is a
flamboyant male model&quot; role, and I applaud it for its judgement.<br /><br />Not a great movie that it perhaps aimed to be, but easily the best
mainstream American comedy I've seen since &quot;Austin Powers&quot;.
