If we define comedy as the genre of movies dedicated to making people
laugh,
then Zoolander is probably one of the best comedies of all times. At least
for me.<br /><br />But beware - this movie may not satisfy most viewers. You'll need to know
at
least the fashion industry basics if you are to be amused by the wacky
insane plot involving top models, sweatshops, lots of vanity and a global
conspiracy to murder the prime minister of Malesia (or &quot;the Klamatian
dude&quot;,
to quote one of the funniest lines in the script). If you've ever met
models, read trendy fashion magazines or had the opportunity to attend
fashion shows' after parties, you'll be screaming with hysterical laughter
from the opening scene until the end. If you weren't that (un)lucky in
your
life, you might find the movie a wee bit silly and not entirely too
amusing.<br /><br />I saw Zoolander for the first time with several friends. One of them
worked
as a fashion photographer, the other as his producer - they were
absolutely
delighted, and started using quotes from the movie in daily life. The
others
were not so impressed - they hardly laughed during the movie, and at all
the
wrong places as well.<br /><br />Well, excuse me, but I think I'll be having an Orange Mocha Frapuccino
now.<br /><br />10/10
