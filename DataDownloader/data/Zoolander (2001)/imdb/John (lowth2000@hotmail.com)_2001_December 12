I came out of the film declaring it to be worth no more than four out of 10.
 I can't fully explain why I have given it such a poor mark even after
upping it to a 5.  It was not that bad, it contained funny moments, it
contained some good ideas, and it had good actors in.  However, it was a big
disappointment.<br /><br />It just wasn't funny enough.  Zoolander was over acted and poorly portrayed
by Stiller.  The character smacked not of idiocy but of insincerity.  He was
annoying, predictable and ill thought out.  It would have been so much
better if Stiller had not affected that dumb accent.  The accent didn't
really work for me and it would have been better to show Zoolander's
stupidity entirely through his dialogue and actions.  <br /><br />It was stupid and ridiculous.  It did contain good ideas with a great deal
of potential humour but... it just didn't work.  To me it seemed ill thought
out, like the first draft of a film, nor really ready for publication.  It
reminds me strongly of another Stiller vehicle, Mystery Men.  Bags of
potential but ultimately disappointing.  It's like the whole thing was just
the product of a bunch of mates having a laugh together.  It needed a lot
more work put into it at the writing stage, and basically a lot more
planning prior to production.<br /><br />The characters were weak.  The models were write offs as main characters
almost immediately - they would have been excellent props and quite useful
as sub characters.  The humour was generally one level humour and without
any shade of subtlety.  There were far too few laughs and at the audience
could be seen cringing on more than one occasion during the film.  That
said, it was well produced and there were funny moments, such as David
Bowie's cameo.  Still the funny moments were not developed enough and
surely, with further work in pre production flaws such as these could have
been reduced. <br /><br />This was not an unwatchable film.  It was entertaining but sadly not awfully
funny, and surely, that is what a comedy is supposed to
be?
