I saw this movie the night it came out, and I thought it was hilarious. Even
in the first few minutes I started laughing, I loved Will Ferrel's part, I
don't know why, but it was just so funny! I kind of thought though, that
Zoolander's accent was a lot like Dr. Evil from Austin Powers. I like the
way he pronounces Matilda's name. By the way she is not Maureen McCormick,
she is actually Ben Stiller's wife, his mom had a small role in the movie
too, but the dad had a larger one. I liked the music they had in there too,
especially the Relax song. Overall I think everyone should enjoy this movie,
it's funny for just about every age. I laughed so hard, and couldn't stop,
somebody actually told me to shut up. That's how funny this movie
is.
