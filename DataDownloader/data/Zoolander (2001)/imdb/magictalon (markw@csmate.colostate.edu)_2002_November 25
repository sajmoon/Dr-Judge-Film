Hilarious movie with Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. The two together, like
in
Meet the Parents, fit very well with each other. The concept of the movie
on
the whole is entertaining. It kind of gives a glimpse into the seedy
underworld of fashion, much like Death to Smoochy did for children's
shows.
So anyway, you really need to have an appreciation for subtleness and
irony,
otherwise you should not really watch it, because you most likely not
enjoy
it. Most characters in the movie are based on their previous acting
careers,
so you sort of need to be up on pop-culture or have watched a large
amount
of movies and TV. Some funny scenes are the gasoline fight and the
walk-off.
There are numerous gags within the movie, some recurring which are
subtle:
the small cellphone, the derelict(e) campaign, Zoolander's &quot;one look&quot;,
crazy
hippie stylings of Owen Wilson, the inability for the models to
understand
the computer, and the breakdance fight. I rate it a 10 because I can
understand it.
