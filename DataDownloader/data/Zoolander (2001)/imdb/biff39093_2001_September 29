I went into Zoolander just wanting to laugh uncontrolably.  Guess what, that
is exactly what I got.  The jokes on pop culture are right up my alley.  The
one thing I can not stand about society today, is the use of cell phones,
and how small they have become.  Ben thought of a nice joke, and the movie
featured a cell phone the size of a half dollar.  That is one of the prize
pieces of the film.  If you are somewhat aware of pop culture, and very
cynical then you will find this picture hilarious.  While in the theater no
one was really laughing that much.  People seemed to only laugh at the parts
they had seen on television numerous times before.  I think that people did
not really understand the jokes, and therefore could not laugh.  They
assumed that it was a brainless comedy.  This was not the case.  The
characters appear thoughtless, but the dialogue is rather witty.  If you
want to escape from things that have been going on, especially in Manhatten,
then go see Zoolander.  You will not regret you went, just make sure you do
not turn your brain completely off, you will need part of it to understand
some of the jokes.  Well, what are you waiting for, go see this movie NOW.
