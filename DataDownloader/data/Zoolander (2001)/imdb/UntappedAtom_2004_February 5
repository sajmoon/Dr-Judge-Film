Perhaps this movie doesn't quite work for Americans or people who lack an
appreciation of dry humour.  Personally, I loved it, as I have loved all of
Ben Stiller's movies.  It seems that most people who dislike prefer movies
such as Meet the Parents, which is very watchable, but has none of the
freshness of impact that Mystery Men had.<br /><br /> I have watched this several times now, and am always delighted with the
construction of an alternative reality for this discrete group of fashion
bods.  What makes it so clever is that it is seamless - it depicts a world
view that is ludicrous, but hangs together very well, and from the outside
looking in, we can get the same feeling as anthropologists examining an
early culture. We are fascinated, repelled, amused.<br /><br /> Enough of the high faluting mumbo jumbo - it is just fun!  I don't expect
everyone to 'get it' or like it - I am just damn well happy it was made so
that I could appreciate it.
