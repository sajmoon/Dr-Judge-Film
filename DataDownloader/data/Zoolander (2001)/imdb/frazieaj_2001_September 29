Ben Stiller is so funny you can't help wanting to push this movie along, but
it's no use.  Zoolander is often amusing, but never quite makes it to funny.
 Maybe another rewrite was needed&#133;
The fact is there are a few laughable moments here and there, but for the
most part they are few and far between or the punch-line has already been
shown to you a hundred times in the commercials &#150; oh when will they learn
that they spoil the movie that way?  But the whole movie is spoiled anyway
with it's way too predictable plot international intrigue and silly facial
contortions.  
Derek Zoolander is based on a character Stiller created for the VH1 fashion
awards and perhaps that's where he should've stayed.  I like Stiller a lot
better when he plays mild-mannered characters who get into hilarious trouble
like in `Something About Mary' or `Meet the Parents.'  And I liked
`Zoolander' better the first time around, when it was called `Austin
Powers.'
Much to my disappointment, this one gets 4/10 stars.
