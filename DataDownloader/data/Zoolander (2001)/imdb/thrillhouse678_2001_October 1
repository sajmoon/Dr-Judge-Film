i don't how on earth this movie is getting a 6.6 on this site. this movie
was hilarious. it had all the great stuff you'd expect from ben stiller. add
to that owen wilson, who is easily one of the funniest actors out there, and
you have a great movie. if you don't already know this whole movie is based
on a skit stiller did at the vouge fashion awards. i didn't see the skit, so
i thought it wouldn't be that good, plus the trailer makes it look pretty
dumb. thankfully this movie was as funny as any movie to come out this year.
i don't know what else i can say without giving away too much, other than
will farrel was funnier than ever, and the whole movie was ben stiller at
his best. go see it.<br /><br />                                              10/10
