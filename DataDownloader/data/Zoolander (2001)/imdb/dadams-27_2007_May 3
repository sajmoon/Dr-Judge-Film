2007_May 3 
I must say that this movie was absolutely awful.I cant believe I
actually sat through it .It wasn&#39;t a little bit funny how anybody rates
Owen Wilson is beyond me,I have yet to see him in anything funny,and
his two mates Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn are not that much better. I
feel that David Bowie has let himself down appearing in this pile of
trash .Could somebody please explain how they find this a little bit
funny.I love stupid films (Dumb And Dumber)and great comedy films.But
the only stupid thing about this was me wasting an hour and a half of
my life.The only tears rolling down my face were tear of woe ,roll on
the next Jim Carey movie
