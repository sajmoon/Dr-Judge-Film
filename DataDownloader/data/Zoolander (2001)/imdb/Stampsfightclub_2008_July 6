Ben Stiller (Meet the parents) stars as Derek Zoolander, a confident
but stupid male model who loses his crown to Hansel (Wilson) and
decides to take time off to search for something else, only fashion
mastermind Mugatu (Ferrell) has his own plans for Derek.<br /><br />This 2001 comedy directed by Stiller is sharp, funny and bizarre, a
very good combination and one of the most delightful surprises of the
noughties.<br /><br />Having portrayed many weird yet wonderful characters in his career,
Stiller again dives deep into his best quality, that daft and humorous
side that his fans love and he does so in such a way to make the film
very enjoyable. Many performances of his have always been fairly
repetitive, however with the type of jokes encoded and his direction
does it come off and with the support, can we see a true energetic
performance. The quality of direction is good, using a variety of shots
and techniques to get the weird and wonderful messages across.<br /><br />Successful support is given by Owen Wilson (Wedding crashers) and Will
Ferrell (Blades of Glory) all comedians with a similar style and
combining recognized comedy actors justifies the genre and gives a
clear message to audience about the life of these characters.<br /><br />Though the plot is predictable, daft and utterly a bizarre portrayal of
what really happens in the fashion industry, you just have to sit back
and enjoy it anyway. Too many films these days, particularly comedies,
are made with no depth and hardly any funny jokes and predictable
written underneath the title, for example The Heartbreak Kid. But
sometimes they work, this script is sharp, and actually is funny with
physical and other types of humour used to justify the needs of the
viewing public, bring back this style of comedy.<br /><br />There will be shaking of the head moments and turning to look at the
wall when one of the clich&eacute;s appear but for the most part, Zoolander is
sharply written, a completely daft yet enjoyable comedy that does work
and is perhaps the best performance by Stiller in his long and
established career.
