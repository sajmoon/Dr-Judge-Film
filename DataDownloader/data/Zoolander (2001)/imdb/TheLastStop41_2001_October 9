 This is one of those movies that look like they're going to be one of the
funniest movies you'll ever see, but it turns out that the preview was
pretty much the whole movie. I mean it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. It
was disappointing. Ben Stiller has been in much better movies. Don't get me
wrong it had it's good parts. Even with a 6.6 it's over rated. I tried to
laugh, but I couldn't get the laugh out louds out of my body. This movie is
the complete opposite of Rat Race. I didn't expect anything from Rat Race.
It ended up being the funniest movie I've ever seen. In this movie the plot
is something everyone has seen before, someone has been brained washed to
kill a prime minister. Sound fimiliar??????????? I think we've seen
something exactly like it, or have seen something close to it. We've
probably seen it in a James Bond film, or The Jackal, etc. Oh yeah and we'll
probably see it in an upcoming Mission Impossible film. But those movies
weren't comedies. This movie attempts to be a competition with Austin Powers
and I'll tell you, this is no Austin Powers. But I have to admit that I
didn't care much for the first Austin Powers. I loved the sequel. My point
is that, if they make a sequel to this, there is a chance it will be better.
But Zoolander is one of those movies that you'll hate, not sure about it, or
love it 'til the day you die. So go see it anyway if you want too. Besides
it is only my opinion. You may love it. <br /><br />Rating: 5/10
