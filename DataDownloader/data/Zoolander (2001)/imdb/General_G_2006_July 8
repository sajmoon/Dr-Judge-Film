What a waste of time and money both for me and the film makers. The is
one of the worst movies I ever saw! Ben Stiller isn&#39;t that great and I
despise Will Ferrell more then the amount of hatred that is thrown at
George W. Bush! I hate these dumb movies that go nowhere, aren&#39;t funny
and have the stupidest concepts ever! Will Ferrell needs to find a
cliff somewhere to jump off of so I don&#39;t have to deal with hearing
another movie starring Will Ferrell is coming out next month. Ben
Stiller&#39;s usefulness in comedy has run out and Christine Taylor isn&#39;t
exactly a person I would call unique. To sum up this review I&#39;d like to
say if you want to see quality comedy watch a John Candy flick.
