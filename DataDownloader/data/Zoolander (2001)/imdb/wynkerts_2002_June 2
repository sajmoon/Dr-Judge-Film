This film was so-so, not a great spoof or comedy.<br /><br />It must be mentioned that Malaysia is not a poor country at all, like the
movie says it is. Malaysia is a fairly advanced and rich country that has
huge oil resources, besides rubber, tin and cocoa. I've visited Malaysia and
by no means does it come across as an impoverished country. The film likely
meant Indonesia which would qualify. Also, Indonesia has been referred to in
news about exploited child labor - Nike, Kathie Lee etc.
