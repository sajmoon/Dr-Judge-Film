The fact is, when you watch a film, you really need to be in a certain
type
of mood for the type of movie it is. The mood can decide whether you're
going to like it or not. Hell, I watched Ace Ventura 2 when I was drunk
and
thought it was hilarious.<br /><br />With Zoolander, you can expect too much and feel let down. I went to the
cinema to see it expecting a bellyacher of a movie. I walked away feeling
it
was an ok movie, with a few laughs. BUT:<br /><br />a couple of months later, I watched it again TWICE. You pick up on stuff
you
missed in the first watching. The jokes seem funnier. The scenes are
funnier. Its one of those movies that in the beginning you think is
average.
But the more you watch it, the more you enjoy it till it turns out to be
one
of your favourite movies.<br /><br />The movie is STUPID. The movie is OUTRAGEOUS. But if you are willing to
take
your brain out for an hour and half and just laugh at the absurdity, the
fake cameos, the dumb jokes but most of the STUPIDness, you'll love it and
you'll repeat the lines over and over again.<br /><br />I can help being really really really ridiculously good
looking!!<br /><br />There's Hansel, he so hot!!<br /><br />I give you, the Derek Zoolander School for Kids who can't read
good!!<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Plus, the walkoff between Derek and Hansel is brilliant. That should be
remembered in comedy history.
