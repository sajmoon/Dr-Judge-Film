Hilarious rip-off of the fashion industry. It was constantly funny the whole
way through. Derek Zoolander's costumes are enough to make you
laugh!<br /><br />This movie features Will Ferrell's best, most hilarious performance of his
entire career. He looks like a friggin' stuffed bunny in this movie. Ben
Stiller's father Jerry plays a hilarious, prostate-challenged old man who's
hilarious in every scene. Later on in the movie, Will Ferrell's character
introduces a fashion line called &quot;Derelicte&quot;. Very hillarious! And there's a
truly unforgettable hypnosis scene that will make you laugh your head
off.<br /><br />Go see this movie. And i'll see you at the Slashy Awards.
