But still, I have a good feeling about Ben Stiller's Zoolander, even though
I can't reccomend it as much as other Stiller comedies (Meet the Parents,
Something About Mary, The Cable Guy which he directed).  It has Stiller as
a
near brain dead male model named, you guessed it, Derek Zoolander.  As he
is
trying to find his roots and try to find another outlet other than the male
modeling world, he is unknowingly (of course) put into a plot to
assassinate
the prime minister of Malaysia.<br /><br />There are some really funny scenes contained in the movie (the best is
seeing a spoof of 2001 as Stiller and Wilson band away at a computer trying
to trun it on) and while they don't add up to make a total funny comedy, it
is stupid fun.  Just make sure to go in the theater with a clear head (and
don't follow Ebert's review).  Many stars make various cameos including
David Bowie, Jon Voight, Billy Zane and others, yet it is Jerry Stiller,
Ben's father, who steals some scenes as a manager.  B-
