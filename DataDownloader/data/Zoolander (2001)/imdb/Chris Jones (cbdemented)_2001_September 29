Is it dumb?
Yes.
Do you get dumber watching it?
Yes.
There is little argument that Zoolander is the dumbest movie of the new
millennium, but it is so well done in it's stupidity it is really worth
seeing. I found myself breathless from excessive laughter several times
throughout this picture, so leave your brain in the lobby and prepare to
laugh at perhaps some of the dumbest jokes in a Hollywood movie,
ever!
