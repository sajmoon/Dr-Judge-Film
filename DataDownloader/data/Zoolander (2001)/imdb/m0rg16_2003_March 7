I have always liked Ben Stiller. He is simply hilarious. And in this movie,
he is at his best. Playing the male-model Derek Zoolander who is 100% he is
going to win the Male Model of the year award again (for the 4th time in a
row) he is taken by suprise when another model, Hansel, takes the price.
Zoolander decides to quit the male modeling business, and go do... other
stuff. (as Zooland probably would have put it). But since his career is
fading, a rich dude called Mugatu wants to hire him for one last job... To
kill the president of Malaysia. After being brainwashed, and some other
stuff, he slowly begins to understand what the male modeling business is all
about. Corruption!<br /><br />Definetly funny! This movie is packed with hilarious jokes and spoofs (the
lemonade commercial, with gasoline, had me rolling on the floor! And so did
the 2001 spoof!), this is a movie you must not miss out on! As usual, in Ben
Stiller movies, Owen Wilson has a pretty big part in it as well, as Hansel,
the arch-enemy of Derek Zoolander. Owen Wilson is definetly too hilarious...
&quot;The files are in the computer? Of course! its so simple!&quot;.<br /><br />Watch this movie, and watch it with an open mind! Its hilarious! 8 out of
10!
