There's a huge amount of difference between &quot;Ben Stiller: The Actor&quot; and
&quot;Ben Stiller: The Director.&quot;  The latter is responsible for the extremely
witty and underrated &quot;Reality Bites,&quot; and the just as clever (but in a
different way) and also underrated &quot;The Cable Guy.&quot;  (Yeah, so Jim Carrey
wasn't playing Ace Ventura again.  Sue him).  &quot;Ben Stiller: The Actor&quot;
invariably turns up in &quot;Haha, man fall down&quot; comedy, like &quot;Meet the
Parents,&quot; which is funny to some, but not to me.<br /><br />Hey, I loved &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot; just as much as anyone, but
Stiller's got more going on upstairs than that.  As of 2001, &quot;Saturday Night
Live,&quot; is stupid-funny.  &quot;Zoolander&quot; is all true.  That's WHY it's funny. 
Or should be.<br /><br />Yeah, every character within it is a blithering idiot, but man, I KNOW these
people.  I went to school with 3 or 4 Derek Zoolanders or Hansels, although
they were less good-looking, which may or may not mean
something.<br /><br />Bottom line, I'm still impressed with &quot;Ben Stiller: The Director,&quot; even if
&quot;Ben Stiller: The Screenwriter&quot; is something less than impressive.  If
you've got any hatred in your heart for pop-culture, this one may be worth
your time.  Otherwise, I hear there's a &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; sequel in the
works.  You're on your own.
