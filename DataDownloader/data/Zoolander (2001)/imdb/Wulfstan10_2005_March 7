The movie had great potential as a spoof of the modeling industry, but
the makers threw much of that away by turning it into a rather absurd,
and fairly predictable conspiracy movie.<br /><br />It still ended up being somewhat entertaining and many of the
characters were great, particularly the two main models. The whole
discussion between Zoolander and his friends about how meaningful it is
to be a model is alone wonderful and hilarious.<br /><br />However, the decision to focus the plot on foiling an evil conspiracy,
while providing some entertaining elements itself, overall adding
nothing and instead distracted from the promising model-spoof theme.
Almost all the humor in this film came from the portrayal of the
modeling industry and they could have done so much more that was fresh
and funny with that had they stuck with it. The conspiracy theme, on
the other hand, took the film onto well-worn path that proved to be
bland, tired, and predictable.
