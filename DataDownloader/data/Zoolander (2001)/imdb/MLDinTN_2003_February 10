but only managed a couple of giggles.  I loved Ben Stiller's previous movie,
Meet the Parents. I laughed so hard during that movie, so I had high
expectations for Zoolander.  But, I just didn't find much that was funny
about this film.  This movie mocks models. Maybe if I was a model, I would
have found this more humorous.  I did like the walk off and when the male
models are slinging gas everywhere to an 80s tune. But, Will Ferrell was
stupid in this and not funny.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: This was more of a satire than a slap-stick funny comedy,
which is what I was expecting.  I don't recommend it because there just
aren't enough funny scenes.
