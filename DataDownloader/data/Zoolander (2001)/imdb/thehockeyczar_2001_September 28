&quot;Zoolander&quot; is a funny movie. There really is nothing more to be said about
the film.  It was not made to win an Oscar, but if you're in the mood for a
good laugh your in luck.  Ben Stiller is excellent as Derek Zoolander, and
Owen Wilson is an absolute riot as Zoolander's rival, Hansel.  The
situation
is so far fetched that it's simply perfect for the movie.  The modeling
sequences make the film, E! has nothing on this film.  Will Ferrell is the
perfect fit as the &quot;evil&quot; fashion designer.  Stiller's performance as an
ignorant male model is classic.  This is one of Stiller's better films. The
celebrity appearances are great, thankfully Ms.Garafelo doesn't make an
appearance.  What other movie has gasoline fights, fashionable Russian
assassins (Milla Jovovich), and the 80s hit &quot;Relax&quot;?  If this is male
modeling....where do I sign up?
