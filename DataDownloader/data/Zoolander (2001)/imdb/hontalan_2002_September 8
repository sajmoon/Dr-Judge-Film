It is interesting to see how almost every comment has a very strong
opinion
about this film. Its either a strong negative, or a strong positive...and
this (in my opinion) is another reason why this film should be considered
a
&quot;cult&quot; film...<br /><br />Personally I believe that this is a great film. Its very stupid, very
brainless, but that is the point indeed. And many fail to notice that.
Unfortunately.
