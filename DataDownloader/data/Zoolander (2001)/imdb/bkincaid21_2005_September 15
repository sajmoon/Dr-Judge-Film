Despite your first time seeing the movie, it is smart and well done.It
took me a few times to realize some really funny ideas.What they did
was incorporate stupid humor into a serious atmosphere, but what i
especially liked, is the one liners.I can understand that it is hard
for some people to appreciate some types of humor, or comedy for that
matter, but if you keep an open mind with this movie, you cant say it
wasn't a little funny.Some very funny people were also in this movie,
Will Farrell was SO funny, Ben Stiller was a great character, if you
look closely Vince Vaughn is in it, Jerry Stiller(Mr. Kastanza).If you
did not like it see it again!
