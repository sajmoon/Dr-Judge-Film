Just like all of Ben Stiller's movies, you need to be watching this with
friends to enjoy it.  And the first time you see it is not the funniest. 
The day after you see it you will be thinking about it and burst out
laughing.  This movie is pretty subtle with it's comedy.  It takes a while
to really sink in and it starts to grow on you.  And fast.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is hilarious and may even be funnier than Meet The
Parents.
