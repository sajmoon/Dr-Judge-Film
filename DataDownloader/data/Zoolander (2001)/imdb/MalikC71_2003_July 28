This is one of those movies that gets funnier every time I see it. I mean,
I
laugh out loud every time I watch it. If there was any industry tailor
made
(no pun intended) for spoofing, it's the fashion industry. This movie is
hilariously quotable, and the cameos alone are reason enough to watch it.<br /><br />Owen Wilson is always funny, and here is no exception. My favorite scenes
(which change after every viewing) are the walk off (with hilarious cameos
from david bowie, in a priceless freeze frame, and tyson beckford)and
Mugatu's frustrated tirade at the end. It's kinda hard to not be funny
when
your frustrated to the point of yelling.<br /><br />
