There are so many scenes in &quot;Zoolander&quot; that try so hard to capture the
American Pie &quot;dirty funny&quot; thing, when the writers should have just
forgotten that and let it be.  Zoolander is a very funny movie, but it's
hidden under all of the sex jokes that don't work as well.<br /><br />Stiller does comedy well, but he did better in Meet the Parents, and Owen
Wilson was funnier (and more interesting) in The Royal
Tenenbaums.<br /><br />And what's with all the star cameos?  There are so many cameos from the
likes of Cuba Gooding Jr., Natalie Portman and Billy Zane, and they're
really out of place.<br /><br />Funny movie, 6/10, I'd have given it a higher rating, but there are so many
out of place scenes.
