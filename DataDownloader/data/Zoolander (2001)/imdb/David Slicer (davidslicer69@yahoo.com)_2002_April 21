&quot;Zoolander&quot; is a film for idiots like me.I like to think of myself as an
idiot for watching this film.The fact that I call myself an idiot for
watching this film is a means of rewarding myself.This is a movie about an
idiot.That idiot is Derek Zoolander whom in the course of the film is
brainwashed to kill the prime minister of Malaysia.The entire film seems to
focus on humorous points that I though were funny and Ben Stiller was
hilarious in the title role.I had alot of fun watching this film because the
way I see it,I was watching myself.No I don't picture myself walking down a
fasion hall as a model,but I do picture myself as an idiot.&quot;Zoolander&quot;
delivers some funny entertaining scenes and the film was
entertaining.&quot;Zoolander&quot; is a film for idiots like me and I am proud to be
one.
