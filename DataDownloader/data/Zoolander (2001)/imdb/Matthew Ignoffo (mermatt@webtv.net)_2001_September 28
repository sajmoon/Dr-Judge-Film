Yes, now the truth is out. It's worse than anything Oliver Stone could
conjure.<br /><br />Male models are behind all political assassinations! Who would have
thought
it? Lurking behind those handsome dumb Himbo faces there was really --
well,
nothing. But that's what makes them so dangerous as lean, mean,
brainless --
gorgeous -- fighting machines.<br /><br />As Zoolander searches for the answer to the ages-old question, &quot;Who am I?&quot;
he goes back to his coalmine roots, becomes ashamed of being a mermaid
(actually a &quot;Merman!&quot;), battles evil in the St. Adonis Cemetery, and falls
in love. Socrates would have been proud of the way Zoolander learns to
&quot;Know
Thyself.&quot;<br /><br />The film has a zany sense of humor as it borrows freely from THE X FILES,
JFK, FIGHT CLUB, THE GODFATHER, and 2001, among others. This satire is
delightful in its sheer silliness. What a great comedy at a time when we
need it!
