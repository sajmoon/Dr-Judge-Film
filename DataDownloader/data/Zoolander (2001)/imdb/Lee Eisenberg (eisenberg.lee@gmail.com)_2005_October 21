Ever imagined a movie whose outlandish premise seems to good to be
true? Well, &quot;Zoolander&quot; is one such movie. Airhead male model Derek
Zoolander (Ben Stiller, who also wrote and directed the movie) is
brainwashed to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia. Yes, that's
the plot; and they do a great job with it.<br /><br />One of the best things about this movie is that it shows how not only
are these models dumb as rocks, but they're often not that
good-looking. I think that no one else could have done it as well as
Ben Stiller and the ensemble cast that he assembled (Christine Taylor,
Owen Wilson, Will Ferrell, Milla Jovovich, David Duchovny, and a WHOLE
BUNCH of other people). This is the ultimate example of a comedy
classic. Perfect.
