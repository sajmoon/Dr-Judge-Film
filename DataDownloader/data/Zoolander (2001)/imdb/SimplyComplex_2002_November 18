When I first went to see this movie in the theater, I didn't think it was
that great at all, sure it had it's funny moments, but the plot wasn't all
that great and I just wasn't into it. I saw it a second time with some
different friends and liked it much more, I caught a few more lines, and
it
really hit me how ridiculously outrageous the movie really is. I then saw
it
a third, fourth, fifteenth, etc time :) I will now have to say this is
probably my favorite comedy of all time. I love Ben Stiller's humor, his
expressions, and his reactions during the movie. I also love Owen Wilson's
part as Hansel, I think the carelessness of both actor's in this movie
make
it a great movie to veg out to after a hard day's work. If you didn't like
this movie the first time, see once or twice more, until it hits you how
crazy some of their stunts are, and how ridiculously funny the movie
really
is!
