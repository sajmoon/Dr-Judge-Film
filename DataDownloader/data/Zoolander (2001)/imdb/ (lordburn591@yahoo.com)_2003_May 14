After spending today reviewing all of my favorite movies, I had to pump
out
a review for the heinously bad Ben Stiller vehicle, Zoolander. Previously
liking the principal cast of this film, (including Owen Wilson and Will
Ferrel), I was more than a little dissapointed after seeing what a clumsy
mess Zoolander turned into. The concept wasn't great to begin with, but
such
terrible execution on the tried and true Dumb and Dumber formula turned
this
film into an example of what not to do in a comedy. There are a few
moments
that may cause tiny giggles, but these moments are also mind numbingly
dumb.
Proceed with caution... this movie sucks.
