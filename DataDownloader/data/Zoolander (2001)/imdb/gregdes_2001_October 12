Looking at some of the other reviews for this movie I can only come to the
conclusion that these folks must have been watching a different movie,
because I can't imagine anyone truly believing that this movie was anything
but atrocious!!<br /><br />The plot was moronic and totally unbelievable, even by silly comedy movie
standards. There were perhaps 2 or 3 scenes that were marginally funny, but
for the major part (and when I say major I mean 99% of the movie), it was
so
bad as to be virtually unviewable!<br /><br />I think what spoke volumes about the quality of this movie was the fact
that
there were exactly 8 people, that's right 8, at a 7:50PM showing on a
Friday
night at a very popular theater. It appears the word has gotten
out.
