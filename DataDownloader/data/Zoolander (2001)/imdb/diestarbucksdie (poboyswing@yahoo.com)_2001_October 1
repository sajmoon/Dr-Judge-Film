i had read some pretty bad reviews for this film but decided to see it
anyway since owen wilson was in it. well that was about all the movie had
going for it. in fact if it were for owen wilson and the way he delivered
his lines i would have probably walked out. this film was just very very
weak, and i would imagine that quite a bit of owen wilsons dialogue was
probably ad libbed like in most of his previous movies which is most likely
the only reason they were the only thing that closely resembled humor in
this movie. im a fan of ben stiller but this is the worst of his work that
i
have seen. bottlerocket fans that go to see this movie be on the lookout
for
the KUMAR reference.
