A really great take on the modelling world. Each Time I watch it I see
something else that makes me howl with laughter. Out of all the
Stiller/Wilson collaborations this is definitely the funniest. There is
so much going on in the film and I love the way all the celebs join in
on the joke. Zoolander has a great soundtrack a very humorous plot and
is light enough to enjoy whatever the mood.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend a few viewings before you make judgement.
Will Ferrell is manic as Mugato and Wilsons Hansel is as laid back as
all his all his characters. The scene in the coal mine is the best.
Enjoy whilst partaking of an Orange Mocha Frappucino. More from the duo
please or a Zoolander II
