Zoolander is stupidly funny, with stars such as Ben Stiller, Will
Ferell, Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, with numerous cameos by big
celebrities. Before there was 'Old School', 'Dodgeball', 'Anchorman:
The Legend of Ron Burgundy' and 'Wedding Crashers', there was
Zoolander. I like to say it kick started the dumb-hilarious-pee your
pants-comedies of the 21st century.<br /><br />Our hero, the misunderstood and um, lacking in brain cells, male model
Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) is at the height of his career, when
things suddenly start to go downhill. There's a hot new male model with
a very different look, the hippie-chick Hansel (Owen Wilson) and a
pretty, but stuck up journalist, Matilda(Christine Taylor) has just
written and unflattering article about him. Then Hansel wins the 'Male
Model of the Year' award. And his best friends die in a, um, tragic
gasoline accident. Poor, Poor Derek.<br /><br />Little does he know, things are about to get worse. Evil Mugato (Will
Ferell with a hilarious white fluffy wig and matching poodle), fashion
god of the city, has an evil plan. He proceeds to hypnotise Derek and
persuade him to- gasp- assassinate the Prime Minister of Malaysia!! By
the time Matilda gets to the scene of the crime, it's too late. So
here's the plot- she must STOP him from killing the poor old Malaysian
dude at a big fashion event. Da-du-daaaaaw.<br /><br />Along the way, Derek pays an unwelcome visit to his (literally)
golddiggin' hometown (featuring a cameo by Vince Vaughn), parties with
celebs (Cameos by Paris Hilton, Billy Zane and David Bowie), befriends
the enemy and even falls in love along the way. Totally worth a watch.
