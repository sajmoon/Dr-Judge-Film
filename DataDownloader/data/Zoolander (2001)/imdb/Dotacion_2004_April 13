Some moveez emit a foul odor and leave a strange residue
behind.<br /><br />Zoolander for instance.<br /><br />Granted, like smelling your own vapours, it's not without it's earthy
delights. De Sade and other great philosophers were wise enough to never
become too detached to enjoy the groveling and filthy part of life, for it
is not without it's humbling charms.<br /><br />It would be a great day for this country if our duly elected officials
admit
they occasionally like to be tied up and humiliated by dominatrix. East
out
of the bowl, little doggy. Arf!<br /><br />I was reminded of a movie from the 70's - Faye Dunaway was in it&sup1; and it
had
an awfully slow pace. It was (to the best of my recollection) about the
vacuous life of a model... and like many movies that portray characters in
some sort of banal state, end up becoming banal itself... in that most
awful
sort of indulgent way (e.g. Lost in Translation). Poor baby, you're
pretty,
that's all that matters. kiss<br /><br />Zoolander, and this unnamed Dunaway pic, were nothing alike, aside from
the
subject matter. Dunaway's was a dramatic treatment of a woman losing her
grip on reality... Zoolander, well, lost it's grip on reality too, but not
as the makers must have intended, I suppose. It's very threadbare idea
unwound before your very eyes like a tennis ball, and the core with all of
the bouncy bouncy energy fell to the floor and splat: was revealed as
putty.
Not the silly kind.<br /><br />Where Zoolander went wrong was told the same gag told time after bleeding
time... the preening, the preening, the preening. Could it have been so
difficult to come up with, oh let's make it easy, two more gags? Then you
could, like a punk band fueled with naught but testosterone and a modicum
of
talent, varied them enough to mine some gold in that great honking
nose?<br /><br />Zoolander's pathos was worn on it's sleeve; there was nothing subtle about
it. The makers had some passing affection for their mentally challenged
characters, but instead of the Dunaway movie, which went for the melodrama
of the pretty woman coming unglued (with all the accompanying
self-importance of that generation of film-making), they went for the
yucks.
Hey, I can't deny there were one or two chuckles. I want to let these guys
clown around. We must encourage the Stillers and (the other guy)s of the
world to have them make more laughs for us, the adoring audience.<br /><br />But alas, it's wasted effort, and even this more than forgiving observer
would have to recommend you give it a pass...
...unless your under 18 and have all the time in the world.<br /><br />1. I just looked it up cos the memory was starting to itch, and it's
entitled Puzzle of a Downfall Child (imdb # tt0066262). Don't bother,
unless... (see the last sentence).
