Probably the best film of the year. The trick is not to take it seriously,
it isn't meant to be a serious film. If you do that, you'll love it. If
you
don't then see a psychiatrist.
The D.V.D. is also excellent with a lot of special features (including the
TV appearances of Derek) and a hilarious introduction from 'Derek
Zoolander'
when you put the D.V.D. in the machine.
Quality stuff.
