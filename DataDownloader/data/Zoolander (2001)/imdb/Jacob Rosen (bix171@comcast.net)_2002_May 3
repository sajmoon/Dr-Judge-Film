There are a fair amount of giggles--but nothing more than giggles--in Ben
Stiller's spoof of modeling and spy movies. Oddly enough, the film seems to
have dated immediately and the farce feels distant due to viewer
overexposure from the E! Entertainment Channel and VH-1 (which has its
imprint all over it). Stiller as a writer and director comes off as snippy
and itching to degrade the modeling profession for no apparent reason other
than its availability as a target; he wants us to share his hostility but
there's nothing compelling as to why we should. As the star, he's almost
acceptable as a vain, dumb supermodel (let's not fool ourselves about his
looks) but his co-star Owen Wilson has the image down pat and subtly
provides most of the humor here, though the real-life cameos (which have
become de rigueur for this kind of picture) are also a lot of fun. Stiller
continues to mine familiar terrain, but this time, rather than dwelling on
the Farrelly Brothers' turf, he invades `Austin Powers' territory and the
result is inconsequential.
