Ben Stiller has a sure winner with Zoolander, one of the funniest
movies of 2001. He plays Derek Zoolander, a male supermodel who has a
crushing blow at the beginning of the film due to Hansel&#39;s win, played
by Owen Wilson. But Derek is put on course to kill the Maylasian Prime
Minister by Mugatu.<br /><br />Definitely a movie that Frat Pack fans should not miss. Will Ferrell,
Vince Vaughn, Jerry Stiller and Christine Taylor also star in this
comedic relic. At one point in the film when Hansel and Derek have a
&#39;walk-off&#39;, many other Hollywood celebs guest star.<br /><br />A 7 seems like a low rating, but this was the beginnings of the Frat
Pack. So after careful consideration, this film still receives a 7.
