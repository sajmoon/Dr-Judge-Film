Ben Stiller (There's Something About Mary, Meet The Parents) appeared on a
video at a fashion award presentation in 1996 parodying the industry with a
character called Derek Zoolander. The video had some carry on the internet
and eventually yet another short skit became a 90 minute movie. Again it
shouldn't have happened.<br /><br />Zoolander isn't just boring, it would also be considered to be offensive,
even inflammatory by a good many people. <br /><br />There are two major themes in this movie. The first is the premise that male
models are dumb and shallow, much as popular film culture has painted blonde
headed women to be. <br /><br />Stiller milks this for all its worth and the results are sometimes amusing.
I especially liked when Zoolander appeared in a commercial as a rather fey
looking merman. Fabio makes an appearance but was considered to be far more
intelligent that Derek Zoolander. That's an attractive
idea.<br /><br />There are a heap of cameos by stars, most notably David Bowie, but so
what.<br /><br />But there's a questionable plot woven around Zoolander and his cohorts
Hansel (Owen Wilson, Shanghai Noon) and Mugatu played by Will Ferrell. Here
lies my main objection to the film.<br /><br />It seems that the U.S. fashion industry bigwigs are worried about the source
of cheap labour with which they manufacture their goods.<br /><br />The Malaysian President is talking about banning slave labour in his country
and so Derek Zoolander, a stupid, brainwashed male model, has been
programmed to assassinate the Malaysian President no less. And this is
supposed to be a comedy!<br /><br />To add insult to threat, The Malaysian President is played in the film as
being a benign looking man of Chinese appearance, a racial slur that
definitely wouldn't please the rather prickly Dr Mahatir, the Prime Minister
of Malaysia, who is proudly Malay not Chinese.<br /><br />Mahatir is no shrinking violet either. He was recently quoted in the
Singapore paper The Straits Times as saying that ` While there are hordes of
Malaysians who are eager to be in the vanguard of IT and the multimedia age,
there are also quite a number who believe television sets should be thrown
into the river because they are instruments of Satan.&quot;<br /><br />I'd love to read his comments on Zoolander!<br /><br />This does matter, particularly in our Southern part of the world. Most
Americans probably couldn't pick out Malaysia on a map but our neighbours
matter to us in Australia, particularly in relation to the current political
climate. <br /><br />Given that Malaysia would have to be considered one of the more strident
Muslim nations, Zoolander adds up to inflammatory politics, even if it was
written before the September bombings in the USA <br /><br />But still they were able to find the time to paint out the World Trade
Center from the Manhattan skyline for a final shot. Didn't want to offend
Americans I suppose. Too bad they didn't drop the Malaysian stuff though.
Knocking off a Muslim world leader to maximise American profits, in a
comedy, is a bit nasty.<br /><br />No Dumb Flys
