2004_August 7 

I have seen thousands upon thousands of movies and I went into this
movie expecting it to be like many of the other comedies starring Ben
Stiller. However thirty minutes or so into the movie I contemplated
actually leaving the theater. After the movie was done I contemplated
pleading with the front counter for a refund. I sat through this movie
hoping that eventually I would see the final credits and the hour and a
half of suffering would be over...or maybe there would be some sort of
character development or plot besides that of &quot;Zoolander&quot; trying to
hone his modeling skills to outdo &quot;Hansel&quot; but it never happened...it
went from bad to worse! I never would have expected to go to a Ben
Stiller comedy and not laugh once...I would like to apologize to anyone
who like me paid money to see this movie. Anyone who has been
contemplating it...don't even rent it. Wait ten years when it is on
Comedy Central and watch it then. It isn't worth the money or frankly
the time it is an hour and a half of your life you will never get
back!!!
