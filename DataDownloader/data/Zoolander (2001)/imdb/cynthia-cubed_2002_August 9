Well, this movie is somewhat a comedy.
(That's what IMDB says)
I'd rather find the Divine Comedy (the book) a lot more
funnier.
(Even though it isn't a comedy)
This is one terribly awful flic that I would never recommend.
I really don't care about mindless plots, but this one went a
little
over the lines. I couldn't even smile once during the movie.<br /><br />This is one movie that I would never recommend. Avoid at all
costs.
Don't even 'rent the DVD'. It's just not worth it.
