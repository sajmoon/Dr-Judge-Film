The first time I saw this one, I thought it was one of the dumbest movies
I'd ever seen.  I thought it was a complete waste of time, and swore I'd
never watch it again.<br /><br />The second time I saw it, I still thought it was incredibly dumb, but this
time I really liked it.  It's just so bizarre and absurd that you just have
to laugh.  Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are outstanding as clueless idiots,
and the rest of the characters are very likable as well.<br /><br />In order to enjoy this one, all you have to do is turn your brain off for an
hour and a half, and you'll absolutely love it.  If you put too much thought
into it, you'll never like it.
