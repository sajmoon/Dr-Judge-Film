2007_February 3 
Obviously it does not take much to make me laugh. This is actually the
only movie DVD that I own, purchased for therapy reasons. Although Ben
Stiller really puts it all out (esp. in the stretching and underwear
scenes during the walk-off), I think Will Ferrell is the one that gets
me the most. My newest, greatest favorite line is, &quot;I feel like I&#39;m
taking crazy pills!,&quot; considering that I do have a history of taking
anti-depressant medication that really just worsened my life. His
little run across the room to the &quot;Center for Kids. ..&quot; model in high
heels is the greatest. And the &quot;foamy latte&quot; scene is not only funny
for the use of the words &quot;bloated&quot; and &quot;farty&quot; but because his
assistant, Todd, is a real scream too. Christine Taylor has got to be
the most non-egoistic actress I&#39;ve ever seen on screen. She manages to
basically just play herself, which I don&#39;t think I see very often in
films (or maybe I don&#39;t know a lot of actors well enough). They do
beautiful makeup jobs on her, too. In all, she is beautiful and clean
and all-American. Some of her expressions/reactions to things that
Derek says are really funny. Is Billy Zane the same guy who was in
&quot;Titanic?&quot; He looks awesome with his head shaved- great physique. I
love and respect movies that involve a tremendous amount of creative
collaboration, and if you just look at the number of celebrities on the
full cast list, it is quite impressive. Funny how Winona Ryder just got
kind of stuck in there. Maybe this is also a feel-good movie for me
because it was basically a family collaboration (Ben and Jerry Stiller,
Christine Taylor)--I can&#39;t imagine my father-in-law telling me that I
would have &quot;a nice rack of lamb&quot; if I used a push-up bra, on or
off-screen.
