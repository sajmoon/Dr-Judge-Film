It was a pretty much dumb-nuts idiotic parody. But I do enjoyed some stars
when they showed up and shined in this flick.
Billy Zane, David Bowie, Natalie Portman, David Duchunit, Jon Voight, Lance
Base, etc.<br /><br />I&iexcl;&macr;m a big digger of Milla Jovovich , every piece of her works, I never
missed. Though , not all of her works are my types.
This one is quite special for her , &iexcl;&reg;cause I&iexcl;&macr;ve never seen her played such
a role before, (Whao! Nice outfit and the makeup) also she is the one who
lights up this flick.   
By the way, watch this movie once , that'll be enough. I rated it a mild 5
out 10.
