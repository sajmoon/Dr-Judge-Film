A parody is almost always nice to watch when done right. There is no doubt
that 'Zoolander' is done right. It walks the walk and talks the talk of
the
models. The moments that it does so are the true value of this movie. The
engine, the plot, of the movie isn't really powerful enough to drive the
movie on for as long as it does though - on the other hand, you do not
watch
'Zoolander' as an investigative action thriller, right?!<br /><br />Entertainment Value: 3/5 (not bad, you'll have some fun)<br /><br />Message: erm... no, you won't go home changed with this
one<br /><br />&quot;Must See&quot; factor: not really<br /><br />Value for Money: $5 max. A 14.99 DVD will be too expensive for this
one
