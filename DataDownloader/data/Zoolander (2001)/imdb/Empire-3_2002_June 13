When I see the trailer and spots of this movie, I thought it would be funny.
I was wrong. Sure, the movie has some funny scenes, but there isn't much of
them. I've seen the VH-1 spots and I think that the film doesn't have enough
ideas like the spots have. Zoolander is quite entertaining, because of the
good performances. Stiller is good as Zoolander and Wilson is excellent as
Hansel. Will Ferrell is good also, but doesn't have enough screen time. Too
bad that the movie isn't quite funny... <br /><br />** out of *****
