From every preview you could tell Zoolander was a sarcastic type 
comedy. At first I thought it would be one of those poorly done type
movies but Ben Stiller did a great job with directing the movie. In
fact I found Ben Stiller to be very annoying until this
movie.
The way the fashion industry is portrayed is hilarious and the
presentation is top notch. Owen &quot;the nose&quot; Wilson's character is
very likeable (like always) and other than a few lines that were just
a little too dumb most of the movie was very funny.
The first review on this page is a good and fair review of the movie.
If you went expecting anything else well... watch the previews next
time before you make the trip.
I recommend.
