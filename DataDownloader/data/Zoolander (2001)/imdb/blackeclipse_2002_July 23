I wasted my 89 minutes watching a stupid film about modeling. i thought it
would have beenmore of a commedy but no, they have some stupid street
modeling where they pull their underwear off...hmm good thing i rented
this
cause if i bought or saw it in the theatres, i would kill myself.  After
the
movie i stared at the screen laughing thinking &quot;hahahah that was one of
the
gayest movies i;ve ever seen in my life i wasted my 5 bucks and an hour
and
a half of my time. trust me if you dont want to get this bored and start
banging your head against a tree, dont rent this.
