Not a favorite on the first viewing, when it premiered, this movie is -
I have to admit it now - hysterical. Don&#x27;t forget that it&#x27;s a parody,
it&#x27;s quirky, completely ridiculous, insane &#x26; over the top and yes,
people in it act stupidly. I&#x27;m not a fan of Ben Stiller, I haven&#x27;t
enjoyed any other movies of his, but this is spot on. I say justice has
been done: it&#x27;s been finally revealed that stupidity knows no gender
when it comes to the fashion world, and it comes in epic proportions. <br /><br />By the way, the fashion world redeemed itself by participating in this
movie. Watch for the countless cameos from famous people in the
industry. The fact that they accepted to make a little fun of
themselves shows that they do have a sense of humor, and that&#x27;s quite
refreshing. <br /><br />Oh, and Jon Voight deserves an Oscar for his deadpan performance as
Derek&#x27;s estranged father. He made me break down and cry tears of
laughter over the terrible drama of the Zoolander family. Words are
useless here, just watch the movie!
