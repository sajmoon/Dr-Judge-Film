Very imaginative and silly comedy starring Ben Stiller. Stiller plays a
world-renowned male fashion model who is brainwashed to kill the new
Malaysian Prime Minister. The short description of the plot may make the
movie sound stupid, but it is a goofy and light-hearted comedy that is
worth
watching. You will either love it or hate it.
Exceptional performances by Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Will Ferrell, and
Jerry Stiller.<br /><br />9 stars out of 10.
