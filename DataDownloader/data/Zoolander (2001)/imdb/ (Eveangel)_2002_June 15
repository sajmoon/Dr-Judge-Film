I thought this movie was a little bit slow on some parts, but otherwise
excellent.  Ben Stiller did a great job in directing the film and starring
in it.  I suggest you see this film only if you can appreciate the humor
in
stupid situations.  Derek Zoolander's (the main character) one liners and
&quot;bits of wisdom&quot; are laugh-out-loud funny.  Will Ferell was unusually
dull,
in my opinion.  I wanted him to have a little more &quot;oomph&quot; to his
character
but we can't have it all.  Nonetheless, it was a truly comedic &quot;idiotic&quot;
film and I hope you will enjoy this movie as much as I did.
