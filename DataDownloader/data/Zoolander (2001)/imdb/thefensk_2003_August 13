In reading the comments I note something I've known for a long time:  many
people have a tin ear for satire.  They just don't get it.  Perhaps the
movie ratings should include a &quot;CONTAINS SATIRE&quot; warning?<br /><br />Ah, well, not every movie is good for every viewer.
Sure it's not the best movie ever made (what movie is?) but this is a pure
satire.  Someone else said it well ... this movie is &quot;part by part&quot; funny.
It really is.  And as a satirical construct, in places it is brilliant.
