Derek Zoolander (Stiller) is a self-obsessed male supermodel who loses
his position as the top male model on the planet to younger, blond
newcomer Hansel (Wilson). In the midst of his midlife crisis, the
dim-witted Zoolander is brainwashed at a day spa by the mysterious
Katinka (Jovovich) into assassinating the prime minister of
Malaysia.This movie wasn&#39;t the greatest neither was it bad. It&#39;s
sandwiched in between both of those feelings:Average. Pro: it&#39;s another
Stiller/Wilson collaboration which makes it great. Con: the script is
very poor. No meaning, just a random movie. My advice: go see it but
it&#39;s hard to follow. Zoolander 7/10
