And that's exactly what it is: dumb.  But not in the sighing, rolling your
eyes, praying to higher powers that the movie would end kind of way.  It was
dumb in that overly cheesy &quot;Austin Powers&quot; sort of way.  In other words, you
have to be pretty clever to write a character that utterly
dim.<br /><br />Some of the comments were just so implausible, so ludicrous, that you
couldn't help but laugh.  And I don't mean that in a negative way.  Can
Derek Zoolander really be that dense?  In this movie, he can and he is.  Ben
Stiller as the overly mugging model was hilarious, but Owen Wilson as his
arch-nemesis Hansel really stole the show.  I'm not even that big of a Will
Ferrell fan, but he's so over-the-top bizarre, you can't help but laugh.  To
paraphrase a quote I've heard before, &quot;he can make you laugh the way a
drunken clown can make you scared.&quot;<br /><br />True, the plot's a little thin with Zoolander brainwashed into killing the
&quot;Prime Rib of Propecia&quot; (watch the movie to understand), but the great
majority of the gags and the one-liners are the fun in getting there.  And
it also has a lot of great '80's songs bounding throughout the
movie.<br /><br />It's funny.  One of the funnier films I've seen for this year, so that adds
a point to it, but at the same time, it loses a point for removing the World
Trade Center buildings from the movie.  A sign of the times, I'm afraid. 
Seeing them not there was not something I cared to be reminded of, however
well-meaning the intent was.<br /><br />But I was glad to see another smart man's &quot;idiot comedy&quot; come out.  It was
high time for one.
