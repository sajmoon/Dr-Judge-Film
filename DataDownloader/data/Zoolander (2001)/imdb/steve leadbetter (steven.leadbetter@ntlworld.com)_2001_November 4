Ben Stiller stars in a movie that is as empty and devoid of content as the
industry it portrays. Admittedly, this picture does contain a handful of
genuinely funny moments but they are too few and far between to cause much
of a rumpus. Brought out amid the foray of media of the September 11th
atrocities, it has generally been well received by the critics with its
efforts to make the people of New York smile again. That in itself is a
very
good point, but it still does not save what, when released under normal
circumstances, is a very lacklustre event. Very forgettable if it wasn't
for
the very brave Producers to release this at a time when public reaction
could easily have gone the wrong way, but didn't.(4/10)
