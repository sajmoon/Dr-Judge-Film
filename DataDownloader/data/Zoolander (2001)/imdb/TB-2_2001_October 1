This has simply got to be one of the sorriest excuses for a movie ever
made.
The only reason that I didn't leave the theatre was that my girlfriend's 8
year old son was with us, and he thought it was hilarious. Hmmm, and it's
rated 14-A in Canada. Terrible acting, terrible script, terrible plot, and
on the satire side - also awful.<br /><br />I will say this though - good soundtrack.
