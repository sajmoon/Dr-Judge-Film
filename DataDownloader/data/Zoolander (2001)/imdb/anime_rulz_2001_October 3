Before watching this movie, I read some reviews of it, and for the
most part, they said it sucked. Too bad. I can't remember the last time I
laughed so hard (oh wait, yeah I do, when I saw Jay and Silent Bob Strike
Back). I admit, Zoolander is not great, but the crazy visuals (the entire
&quot;Relax&quot; scene) and numerous cameos (it's hard to name someone NOT in the
movie) make this one heck of an entertaining movie. My only problem is the
&quot;male model is dumber than a bag of doorknobs&quot; jokes that play through the
entire film; most of them aren't that funny. But despite what any reviewer
says, I recommend any &quot;fan of silly comedies&quot; to see this
one.<br /><br />
