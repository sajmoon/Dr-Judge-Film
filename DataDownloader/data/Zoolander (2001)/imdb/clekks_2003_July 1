Take a bad performance, combined with a crappy story and jokes that are
&quot;so&quot;
funny, that even 8 year old children can't laugh about it, mix it all up
and
the result will be this movie.<br /><br />IMO none of the jokes are worth to laugh at, even if I expected a pretty
nice movie after I had seen the commercial.
