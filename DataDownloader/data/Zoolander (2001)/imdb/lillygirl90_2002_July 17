Okay, i'll admit that i know it's supposed to be a stupid movie, but Ben
Stiller (star, director, producer, writer) outdid himself on trying to be
stupid in this movie. If you went to see this movie expecting to laugh at
stupid jokes, you left thinking &quot;What stupid jokes? the whole thing was
stupid!&quot; don't see this movie!
