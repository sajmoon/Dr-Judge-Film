While it is, of course, the job of an actor to act, there are certain
things that just can&#39;t be done. Without straining the ability to
suspend disbelief, for example, you could not have Oprah Winfrey play
the biological mother of Haley Joel Osment. Having Bernie Mac play JFK
would be another stretch that&#39;s pretty much unimaginable. And the idea
of having Ben Stiller or Owen Wilson play male models is on the same
level.<br /><br />Some people might say that that&#39;s the point - it&#39;s inherently funny to
have a man who resembles a chimpanzee and a man with half a nose
playing models. That might be true, were it not for the fact that Ben
Stiller, Jerry Stiller and Owen Wilson have, between them all, the
comedic talents of a stale animal cracker. The only plus to this movie
was Will Ferrell - that&#39;s it.<br /><br />I have no idea what a person might find funny about Zoolander - clearly
some people find it endlessly amusing, even some of my friends - but I
can&#39;t, in good conscience, recommend it to anyone that I don&#39;t want to
see commit suicide. If you really want to experience something that
nearly emulates the amount of pain this movie will inflict without
having to spend over an hour watching it, may I advise the following?<br /><br />Go duck hunting with Dick Cheney. Have an intimate encounter with a
food processor. Dip your most sensitive bits in gravy and tease a rabid
wolverine. Hug a wrecking ball (in use). Apply for a job brushing the
teeth of great white sharks.<br /><br />Any of these will allow you to experience the sheer mental torture that
&quot;Zoolander&quot; will inflict on you without actually having to invest the
time in watching Ben Stiller &#39;act&#39;.
