Seeing that Ben Stiller directed, co-wrote, co-produced and starred in this
film, one would think there'd be some &quot;personal vision&quot; in evidence, but
alas, Stiller seems to be no auteur. This is a light, insubstantial
sprinkling of dressing, lacking a main course. As the venerable John says
below, the film is much like a few episodes loosely put together by a bunch
of friends. Stiller really does impose no proper structure upon this film;
it does seem more like a half-baked &quot;TV special&quot; than a film.<br /><br />Most tellingly perhaps, Stiller's main character is a truly unsubtle
stereotype, far from funny himself, or even when used as comic fall guy. The
character is plain irritating; Stiller seems to think a few gormless
mannerisms and a silly voice are enough; frankly, they are not. Tellingly,
one can never quite sympathize with this &quot;character&quot;.<br /><br />Overall, a bad film, which was watchable, just about, if cringeworthily
cliched a lot of the time. There were a few half-laughs, but a mere few do
not a comedy make. <br /><br />Rating:- **/*****
