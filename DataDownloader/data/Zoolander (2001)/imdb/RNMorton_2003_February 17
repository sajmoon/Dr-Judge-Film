Okay even I&#x27;m not that dumb. Ben Stiller is Derek Zoolander, reigning
international male model until Owen Wilson comes on the scene. Subplot
involves scheme by fashion mogul Will Farrell to use Derek to kill
third world leader, but the most fun is in the spoof of modeling by
Stiller and Wilson. Hard to understand the spread of IMDb reviews on
this movie, I would say it&#x27;s definitely a notch above the typical
SNL-type theme comedy movie (Strange Brew, etc) but falls a little
short of a comedy classic. Farrell is a lot of fun in his role, David
Bowie has an inspired appearance and Stiller and Wilson almost always
play well together. Taylor&#x27;s many reaction shots are also priceless.
For what it&#x27;s worth, the first time I saw this I started halfway
through and thought it was even more hilarious than when I saw it again
from the start, but just the same I will tune in often when it&#x27;s on.
