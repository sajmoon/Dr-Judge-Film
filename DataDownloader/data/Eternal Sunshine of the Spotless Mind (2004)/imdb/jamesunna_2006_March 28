A girlfriend or boyfriend that doesn't work out can be one of the most
painful things we can ever experience. If given the chance would you
really want to erase them completely from your memory? The title of
this film could be written as a question: Is there eternal sunshine for
the spotless mind? Or perhaps we have to take the risk of great pain if
we are to ever experience great joy and to really live life.<br /><br />The science behind it is kinda reminiscent of the science behind the
matrix. Somewhat questionable. However as with the matrix if you can
suspend disbelief it doesn't matter. The film is one that needs to be
watched at least twice. The order is not strictly chronological and on
the first watching you might not have a clue what's going on. However
bare with it. When it started to make sense to me it bought tears to my
eyes with its poignancy.<br /><br />One of my all time great films. Jim Carey who got on my nerves in Dumb
and Dumber is excellent in this more serious role. Great script, great
acting and a haunting soundtrack make a great movie. A must see.<br /><br />Oh and well worth a watch with a plate of special K. Hehehe...
