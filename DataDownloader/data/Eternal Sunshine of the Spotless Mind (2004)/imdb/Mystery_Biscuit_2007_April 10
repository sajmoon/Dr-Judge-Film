Eternal Sunshine... seems to be one of those films that really divides
its audience. (In fact, I think&#39;s it&#39;s only behind Napoleon Dynamite as
a film which inspires such devotion or dislike in equal measure).<br /><br />I personally love the film. I think it&#39;s a inspired concept,
excellently handled and visually stunning - and a welcome break from
all the saccharine Sleepless in Seattle-style romantic comedies that
clog the market.<br /><br />I think it is one of the most genuinely moving love stories of this
oh-so-cynical age. It portrays modern relationships for what they are:
turbulent, destructive, and by no means easy - filled with neuroses and
obstacles, but ultimately the most intoxicating and enjoyable
experiences life can throw in your path.<br /><br />It shows that romance isn&#39;t in dull plot contrivance; in a race to
catch your true love before their train leaves the station; in a
mysterious romantic note found in a bottle, etc. Love is found in the
little moments shared by two people, the memories that are known only
to its participants.<br /><br />The film is also the best example of the human mind imagined as a
landscape that I can think of.
