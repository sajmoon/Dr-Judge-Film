&quot;The Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind&quot; is one of the untypical
Carrey films.Brilliant film,made me think about my life and relation
ship..And also...-the human being itself. A very different character
for Jim Carrey to play but he played the role very,very believable.
And- like he always does,with brilliance! He showed once again in
&quot;Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind&quot;what brilliant performer he is
and that he is easily capable of playing different characters.If I
think about &quot;Man On The Moon&quot;,&quot;The Truman Show&quot;,&quot;The Mask&quot;,&quot;The
Grinch&quot;...(I don't want mentioned all of his films) they all
different.But not that he &quot;plays&quot; different characters,no,he plays them
believable... This and his ability of playing different characters make
him unique from others...I believe that everybody who watch this movie
can learn something from it. I give him a 10!! Well done Jim go on...
