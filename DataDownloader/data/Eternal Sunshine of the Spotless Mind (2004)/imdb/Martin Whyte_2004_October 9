This film is a lot like 'the butterfly effect' in that the storyline
isn't one of those cut and paste generic films (like...well...just about
everything else). you will have to pay attention, but this is an
extremely good film. jim carey makes the transaction from 'funny guy'
really well (like aston kutcher does in tbe...) and his character is
fully played out. to explain the storyline would give away too much,
but it is largley based around his relationship with his girlfriend,
and her wanting to forget their break up...and in no way relates to six
annoying people (3 guys 3 girls) sharing two flats in New York, which
is turned into AN ELEVEN SEASON series.<br /><br />Why aren't more things like this and less...bad?
