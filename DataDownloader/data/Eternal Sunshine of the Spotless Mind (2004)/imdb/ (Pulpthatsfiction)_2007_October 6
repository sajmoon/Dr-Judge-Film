Simpley the best movie ever. From the direction to the acting to the
story this film is brilliant. Kate Winslet steals the movie with the
greatest performance of all time. I hate and love Clementine and thats
what I think thats what the writer wanted to feel about Clementine. Jim
Carry also gives a great performance and for some reason Jim Carry and
Kate Winslet didn&#39;t get the Oscar and that has mad me mad, even though
it dosen&#39;t matter that they win or not. The co-stars did a great job
and worth being notice. To my point of view this screenplay is the best
that has ever been written and may stay that way for a long time. The
filmaking of this movie is great too and should be like by movie gores.
This is only romance story I could relate too even though I haven&#39;t
found love yet. There&#39;s only been two films that have change my life on
this level and there are this movie and Fight Club. This is also the
movie that got me into the romance movies and have become my favorite
movie genre. I can&#39;t express how good this movie and the most
heartwarming and heart breaking script and story of all time. This is
the movie that made want to be a filmmaker for sure in my life. I would
recommend this movie too anyone that loves movies and want to see a
good movie.
