wow, what a great movie, this one caught me off guard i did not even
know as much as the storyline when i popped this into my DVD player.
what a great movie it has anything you could ask for in a movie and
more it really plays your emotions, it is filled with love, sadness,
inspiration, despair, humor, loneliness, deceit and the list could go
on and on.<br /><br />this is a story about a couple who really has an amazing relationship,
but they let a few issues bring them down and on the spur of the moment
they end it. it is so true that you really do not know what you have
until you loose it, and this movie really exemplifies that.<br /><br />there are so many things to be learned from this film, all i can say is
watch it, i assure you there is something in this gem for you. however
this is very much a thinking and feeling movie it is not just some
cheap Hollywood production with sex and violence, in fact there is
neither of those in this movie.<br /><br />it is a movie that tells you to hold onto what you love and never let
it go, because you never know what might happen, it tells you to really
live every day as if it is your last for your life blinks before you.<br /><br />this will be one of the few movies i full heartedly recommend to
anybody, and i am very glad to see that it already has quite the
popularity. if you have not seen this movie then see it, get it into
your head as soon as possible, for your life is ticking away and you
don&#39;t want to learn you are living a crappy one before its too late.
