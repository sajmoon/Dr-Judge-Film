Kind of cool concept film, exploring ideas, quirky characters and
relationships. Although Carrey has some funny lines and some funny
situations its not really a funny film. In addition to Carrey as the
quirky boring guy who does not quite fit in, which is a stable of a
certain genre of literature/movies, the other actors in the film are
well worth watching. (Other QC in the world, &quot;L'Etranger by Simone&quot;,
&quot;Philip K. Dick's Jack&quot;, Kafka's Penal Colony, a black and white movie
called I believe &quot;The Following&quot;, etc, etc) - Kate Winlset as Carrey's
impulsive high mtc high intensity techno-colored haired intellectual
lover. - Wilkinson does a great job as playing the doctor - Woods and
the Ruffalo are great as the detached technicians with no respect for
their client's property. Like the guy's who work on your car or perhaps
the guy at the funeral home when the family's not around, ... Most of
the incidental comedy in the film come from these guys.
