Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was one of movies of 2004. It
actually surprises me how it wasn't nominated for the Oscar of Best
Movie. It was the most mature and touching movie of the year. The movie
tells the story of a couple that faces a hard relationship time. To end
this, Clementine (Kate Winslet, marvelous) erases Joel (Jim Carrey,
spectacular) of her mind. Heartbroken, Joel manages to do the same
thing- but gives up after realizing she is the one. The movie also
counts on the amazing performances of Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo,
Kirsten Dunst, and Tom Wilkinson. This movie was awarded with the Oscar
for Best Original Screenplay- with reason. Eternal Sunshine of the
Spotless Mind is a must see. Another advice: watch it with your loved
one.
