What is not to like about this movie ? It is not a movie to watch
casually, it pays to watch it carefully and keep up. The effort is
worth it though. Kate Winslet shines in a type of role that would be
perfect for Jim Carrey but instead, he plays the more down to earth
role that Kate so often inhabits. They are both superb in their
engaging relationship. Charlie Kaufman has written his best screenplay
so far, Adaptation was superb but this was plain amazing. He is such a
great writer. Michael Gondry managed to direct this movie with some of
the most original scenes, with editing to match in a way that remains
confusing but makes sense (honestly!) and is deeply moving if you have
ever been in love. I think the movie is just as good, if not better on
the second viewing. It is encouraging that movies of this calibre that
are so original and fresh are still being made.
