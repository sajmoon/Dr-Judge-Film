This movie is really good. I can't put in any other way.<br /><br />The story is cool and is one of those films that it all makes sense
after you have viewed the whole thing. From the first part of the movie
it is kind of confusing until you see the final portion. The story
involves the love relationship between Joel (Carrey) and Clementine
(Winslet) which begins to hit the skids, to put in in simple terms.
Clementine decides to erase Joel from her memory. Joel goes to meet her
one day, and finds that she does not remember him. He decides to have
the same procedure done to have her erased from his memory, though he
suddenly has a change of heart and wants to keep his memories of her. <br /><br />The acting is really good from Jim Carrey most of all. It is a nice
change to see him doing something other then a comedic role. He plays
the role very well. Kate Winslet is also very well at playing the role
of Clementine.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for something to
watch with your spouse. Or if you just want a good movie to watch, rent
this one.
