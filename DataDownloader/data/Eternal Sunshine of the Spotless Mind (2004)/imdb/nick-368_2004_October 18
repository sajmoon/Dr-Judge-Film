If you liked Being John Malkovich or Adaptation (both thoroughly
recommended) then you'll like this, another brain-flip movie by
screenwriter Charlie Kaufman. In this, Jim Carrey realises his
girlfriend has had her memory of him and their relationship erased by a
sinister corporation, so he does the same. Whilst they're at work on
his brain, killing off the memories of her, he realises he doesn't want
them to. We see all his memories being destroyed as though in a dream,
which is very trippy. The director, Michael Gondry, made some very
interesting pop videos including the amazing Chemical Brothers 'Star
Guitar' which is shot through the window of a train, and in which
passing objects like telegraph poles are incredibly timed to beats of
the music. When I first saw the video I was so impressed that my jaw
unhinged and crashed to the ground as in an old Tex Avery cartoon, and
some of Eternal Sunshine has this same quality to it. Anyway, a very
different film, one of those that as soon as it's over you want to
watch it again; Carrey and Winslet are good. Also check out the other
Kaufman titles if you like films that require some activity of the grey
matter.
