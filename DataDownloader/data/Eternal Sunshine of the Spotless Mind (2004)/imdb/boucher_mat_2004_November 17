I just saw the movie and it well deserves a 9. I feel totally moved
inside.<br /><br />This movie is just complete to me. It's just brilliant. Original and
full of imagination. It's a funny movie, but at the same time, I felt
almost like crying at certain times. It has a particular melancholy. It
has some pretty weird scenes which I usually like in movies, but
sometimes it's just too much, like you don't know where it's going,
what's the point. This one avoid this path, that's why I think it's a
complete success. The Jim Carrey's character and his relationship also
reminds me of myself on certain points, I think that's why the movie
touches me this much.<br /><br />Anyway, you definitively need to watch this. But beware : one of my
friend says it's the worst film he has ever seen. For my part, I'm
considering putting it in my personal favorites...
