This move is amazing. It is a story of love and heartbreak. It really
defies the science fiction or speculative fiction genre. If you enjoy
movies of romance/science fiction/ and high morals, Eternal sunshine is
for you! The movie centers around Joel Barish who just broke up with
his girlfriend Clementine. Clementine has gotten a procedure done by a
company called Lacuna to erase all of his memories, meanwhile Joel
decides to get the brain procedure done as well. The story is so
different and interesting, it also has a background mini story with the
workers of Lacuna who play a role in the turn of events. Seen as
confusing by many the story takes you from the beginning and back to
the beginning.<br /><br />If you think you will enjoy this movie please don&#39;t hesitate and give
it a try. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a heartwarming movie
and will leave you satisfied in the end. Beautifully captured, give it
a try!
