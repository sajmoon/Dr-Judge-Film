This movie gives me fast heartbeats.<br /><br />It&#x27;s wonderful, how this movie creates a connection with the spectator.
It&#x27;s almost magic.<br /><br />It gave me a feeling, and that&#x27;s why movies are for, this is pure art.
Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey are at the best. Those two actors have
crowned themselves to Legend actors.<br /><br />Congratulations to Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman, this movie
deserves his Oscar and I think Kate Winslet could have won an Oscar
too.<br /><br />If you didn&#x27;t see the movie: WATCH IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!
