Of the movies I saw in 2004 this one takes the cake as the best, with
The Incredibles a close second. The movie haunts you, stays with you
for days. Jim Carrey has his best performance to date, it's a very
understated(for him), nuanced role. And Kate Winslet is the epitome of
an actress whenever she's on screen. The other actors in the movie,
Elijah Wood, Tom Sozemore, Mark Ruffalo and Kirsten Dunst all give
great performances as well. Of all the Charlie Kaufman movies this is
his finest screen writing work. I could babble on for lines of text
about this movie, but I'll just say see it, and you won't be
disappointed.
