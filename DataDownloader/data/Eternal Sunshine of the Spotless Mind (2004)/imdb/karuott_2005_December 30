For me it was a second time to watch Eternal... Around a year after
first view. The stuff is as great as it was then. I'd like to point out
what a great performance of Jim Carrey this movie really is. For a long
time I belonged to the probably pretty large group of people who just
hated Carrey altogether with those stupid and kick-in-the-ass
&quot;comedies&quot; he was appearing in. My view of him started to change when I
saw &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;. A different, multidimensional character started
to appear. So Eternal was not a complete surprise in that sense. Still,
in this film he proves himself being a true actor. Just the same can be
said about Kate Winslet, of course. What is now left is to hope that
there will be more chances for Carrey to show his acting skills at
their best!
