I have seen this film so many times and I am watching it as I am
writing these lines. I love the writing, great acting, I mean Kate is
awesome and so adorable! And Jim is amazing which makes the two of them
the perfect casting choice for this story. What a great story, a theme
we all deal with every time we go thru a break up and when we stay
married and get boring and when we start a new relationship. It&#39;s all
in there and it is express in such a beautiful way. Clementine and Joel
what a couple, I&#39;d say couple number one. The only funny thing is Frodo
showing up in the middle of the film, I think he to a wrong turn on his
way to mordor. But Mark Ruffalo and Tom Wilkinson are great. i don&#39;t
care much for Dunst, but I guess she does her job for the role. So all
in all film you want your relationship to be like, and most probably it
is!
