I first saw the movie about a month ago, and was not really that
intrigued, until I was left alone at home on a glum Saturday. I
remembered the movie, and thought I should have a go, as it seemed to
get rave reviews from friends and family. I was not disappointed. I was
transported into a world of such intense emotion and completely forgot
about my surroundings and circumstances. I was really swept away by the
superb performances by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslot. The story is so
outrageous, yet in this movie, so believable! The supporting characters
are fantastic, and the movie as a whole, from start to finish keeps
you're mind enraptured, and transports you into Joel and Clementines
world, and the beginning and ending, and yet another beginning of their
love. The underlying message to the story, which could mean so many
things to so many people is clearly shown in the plots and sub plots of
the movie. Three days after viewing the movie, I am still caught up in
the movie, and still very awed by it's effect on me!
