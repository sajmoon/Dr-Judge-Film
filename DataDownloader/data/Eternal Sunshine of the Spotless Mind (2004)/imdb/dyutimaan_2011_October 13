Highly recommended. The brilliance of the movie lies in the way the
emotions of the two main protagonists are dealt with. Jim Carey as
&#x27;Joel&#x27; is his role of a lifetime and &#x27;Clementine&#x27; played by Kate
Winslet complements him perfectly. As the memories are being erased,
the way &#x27;Joel&#x27; realizes how much he loves &#x27;Clem&#x27; is apparent with the
fear of losing her that can be seen in his eyes and by his actions.
&#x27;Clem&#x27;s&#x27; character has been played brilliantly by Kate Winslet whose
acting skills have always been out of this world. How she pulls of
those vivid hairstyles and tops are a mystery in itself. The locations
have been selected with great care and go hand in hand with all the
scenes that are being shot. This movie has all the flavors of emotions&#x27;
present in it. Its a unique experience in itself. This movie is not
only meant for the people who understand love or have been in love, its
meant for anybody who loves &#x27;good cinema&#x27;. A must watch!
