ESSM will be a darling of the pseudo-intellectuals who will tell you that
simply don't have the mental capacity to understands the discrete levels
of
plot and nuance.  It's a BAD movie full of people you don't like and don't
care about.<br /><br />Mr. Carrey's character seems to be seriously over-medicated (Paxil,
Thorazine, etc.), he has no personality! (Nicholas Cage must have turned
the
part down.) The false timeline (the beginning of the film is really the
end
of the film)is a poor story devise.  The inconsistencies show up quickly,
but aren't explained until the end of the movie.<br /><br />Finally, although the science is very sketchy, the memory-erasing
technology
is the ultimate form of deus ex machina.  I only wish I could erase the
memory of this total waste of my time.
