Hey, i saw the movie last night and was literally swept off my feet.
I'm still shocked. It really was the best movie I have ever seen. I
haven't seen that many of Charlie Kaufmann's movies - only this one and
Being John Malkovich ( also a movie which enters the human mind!). I've
heard great things about Adaptation. I'm definitely going to see that
movie after having experienced Charlie Kaufmann's genius.<br /><br />I'd like to hear more comments about what the movie did for you. The
message that comes across in the movie, I think, is a brilliant
message. And the way it's presented is fantastic. <br /><br />I am a seriously a more informed and really better person for having
seen this movie!
