Wow... this had me spellbound. Deep, intimate piece. If one wasn&#x27;t
already convinced that Jim Carrey is an actor, not just a comedian, one
would be so after taking this in. Winslet does incredible, as well(and
both are playing against type), as does everyone else that I can think
of(Dunst also impressed me). You have to pay attention during this, and
a second viewing may help, but it&#x27;s not so abstract and loose that it&#x27;s
difficult to understand. This is the third work of Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s
that I&#x27;ve seen(the other two are Being John Malkovich and Confessions
of a Dangerous Mind), and by far my favorite. Anyone who has ever loved
can relate to this. I can&#x27;t promise it&#x27;ll be pleasant, in fact, it&#x27;s
possible that it won&#x27;t, but this is absolutely absorbing. This is
mature, smart and does not try to distance itself, or its audience,
from the subject matter. I haven&#x27;t seen any other work by Gondry, but
he directs this magnificently. Masterful visuals, and somehow
apparently with little to no CGI. The editing and camera-work are
excellent. Story-telling and characterization are of such high quality
that I&#x27;m not sure words can do them justice. The ambiguity of the final
moments is perfect. All of the special effects are amazing. The movie
pulls you in, it is thoroughly engaging throughout. I&#x27;m not sure any
viewer can avoid being affected by this. You may not recognize every
scene as something from your own life, but the feelings, the
impressions... they&#x27;re universal. I don&#x27;t remember when I&#x27;ve last been
this into a big screen experience. Anyone who can watch films that are
personal, and emotionally powerful should consider this. There is some
strong language and sexual content, as well as drug references and the
like. The DVD holds two featurettes, one of which I will review on its
own page here on the site, interesting deleted scenes, a fake
commercial, a music video, and an informative commentary track with the
Michel and writer Charlie Kaufman, all of them also well worth your
time. I recommend this to anyone who is or has been in a relationship,
and who don&#x27;t need their cinematic experiences spoon-fed. 10/10
