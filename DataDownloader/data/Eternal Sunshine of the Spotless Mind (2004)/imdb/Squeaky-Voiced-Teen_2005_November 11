I'm a 15 y.o boy, not a big fan of the romance. I was bored and decided
to watch it. Jim Carrey has obviously proved himself capable of doing
serious roles, The Truman Show being the best so far, no doubt in my
mind that he couldn't have pulled it off. And with flying colors he
passes the test again. He manages to portray Joel Barish with so much
depth and purity, you'd think he was incapable of doing comedy. Nothing
special to point about Kate Winslet's performance, though also great,
not outstanding.<br /><br />The storyline is nothing but pure genius remains that way until the
credits roll. It has amazing cinematography, flashbacks, and the script
itself is a piece of art.<br /><br />Thus making this film into a modern-day classic. Lovers of every genre
will enjoy this, it's just one of movies you have to have seen. You
will never regret it, trust me, I haven't. - Sheer Brilliance. -
