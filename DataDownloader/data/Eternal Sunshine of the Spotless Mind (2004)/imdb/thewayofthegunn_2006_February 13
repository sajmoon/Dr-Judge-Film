The thing that surprised me the most about this film is that it was
made in Hollywood. This is an absolutely beautiful film. This is the
sort of film that Hollywood should make more regularly, but I know
films like this don't make a lot of money. <br /><br />To see both Jim Carrey &amp; Kate Winslet play against their usual
characters, and pull it off with skill, heart &amp; determination is also a
very pleasant surprise, as well. Many of my friends didn't even
recognize Jim Carrey until well into the film. This is a true testament
not only to both these actors, but to the direction of Michel Gondry.
It is obvious that he does not compromise when he makes a film (or if I
might be so bold as to say &quot;a piece of art&quot;). <br /><br />The final surprise and another pleasant one, is that, much as in life,
this movie does not have a happy ending. In fact, Gondry trusts the
intelligence level of his audience enough to leave the ending open and
allow the viewer to extrapolate as to what will happen next. Kudos to
the Hollywood production company and/or the producers who let the
ending stand.
