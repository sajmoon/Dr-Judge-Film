&quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; (2004): Like other films of the
last few years, there continues to be a rush to shatter, spin, crank,
or turn inside out the plot structure. To whom shall we give credit?
Quentin Tarantino and his &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;? Well, like any FASHION trend,
it can used as an empty, stylish method to hide a lack of substance,
or, LIKE &quot;Eternal Sunshine...&quot; it can be used to support the topsy
turvy story it sets out to tell. We learn that a man (Jim Carey) has
been rejected by a woman (Kate Winslet), and he's pretty torn up about
it. We then learn he wants to get her back. Standard fare. THEN things
change. You'd better be of clear head when you watch this one, because
it's going to challenge you with it's depictions of alternate
realities, internal visualizations, and moments that for some time will
feel helter skelter. Only with work will you keep up.
Honest...hmm..m....unless I'm just a Dumb or Dumber Guy. Here are some
of the pleasant surprises (and I'm giving away NOTHING by listing
these, so you can open your eyes again now): Jim Carey can now be
considered a good actor along with a great comedian. It happened to
Bill Murray and Robin Williams too. This is an innovative, thoughtful
film that asks a lot from you. There ya go. Love it or leave it on
those terms. It does NOT pander to the audience.
