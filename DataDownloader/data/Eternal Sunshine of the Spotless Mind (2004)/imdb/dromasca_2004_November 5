I sincerely do not understand what the buzz about this film is about.
Charlie Kaufman's story is based upon the idea of erasing memory and
the way it affects relationship and love. For science-fiction fans the
idea of memory manipulation is not that original at all. Recently the
'Bounty' series or 'Paycheck' brought it to the big screen, and did it
in a more attractive way, leading to good action films. The
relationship story in 'Eternal Sunshine...' is rather banal, and even
Kaufman could not resist to a quite routine ending. A lot of screen
time is spent into simulating the effect of memory erasing, but I found
much of it not-inspired and artificial. Jim Carrey is mis-casted, he
wears a monkey grimace much of the film that let me ask how he could
raise the emotional interest of Kate Winslet. Kate is better than Jim,
while Elijah Wood and Kirsten Dunst do good supporting roles. Overall,
I did not find the film too interesting, it's just fair entertainment
that tries but does not succeed to be something else. I cannot share
the enthusiasm of many other viewers about it, and gave it a 7 out of
10 on my personal scale.
