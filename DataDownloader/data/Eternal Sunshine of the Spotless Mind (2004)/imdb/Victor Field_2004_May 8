&quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; is one of those movies that
signifies its strangeness by having the opening credits come quite a way
into the movie (a la &quot;Alias&quot;). If nothing else, it lives up to the mindset
it promises, although I have to admit I don't love this movie as much as
others do; director Michel Gondry and writer Charlie Kaufman have certainly
delivered a clever and touching tale... but it's a bit too much of the
former and a bit short on the latter.<br /><br />The movie's biggest problem is that Jim Carrey (cast against type as an
introverted nice guy) and Kate Winslet (as a woman who we know is a free
spirit - though a troubled one - because she keeps changing her hair colour)
don't really seem like they are or ever were a couple, even allowing for
opposites attracting. This doesn't ruin the movie's effect, but it does make
it seem a bit remote, especially as their relationship is seen almost
entirely from his point of view. Remember, there are two sides to every
story, and although we do eventually see her side of it, the real added
dimension comes from Kirsten Dunst as the receptionist at the company that
performs the mind-wiping that triggers the plot. She seems surplus to
requirements at first, but it turns out that she's there to do more than
dance on a bed in a T-shirt and panties.<br /><br />This is one of the movie's main strengths (not Kirsten Dunst in a T-shirt
and panties*); everything proves to have something else going on under the
surface, including the structure of the movie itself. The constant
unpredictability and the conviction of Carrey's performance as the man on an
adventure inside his own mind makes it more than the exercise in cleverness
for cleverness's sake that it could have been - the movie never forgets that
it's a romance at heart. Jon Brion's wonderful score (which is almost
another character in the movie) is another plus; so is Tom Wilkinson as the
doctor in charge, and so are Dunst, Winslet, Mark Ruffalo and even Elijah
Wood.<br /><br />But though funny, ingenious and even a little touching, in the end &quot;Eternal
Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; is a feelgood movie for people who like to
think they're too smart to be caught at feelgood movies; I like it,
certainly, but I can't help wondering if this is one of those movies that
viewers of a certain kind SAY you should love, rather than something you can
take to your hearts of your own accord. Either way, it deserves a second
viewing, and there aren't many Jim Carrey that even merit
one.<br /><br />*Which is not to say that's a bad thing, mind.
