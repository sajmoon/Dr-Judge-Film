Originally when viewing the trailer for Eternal Sunshine of the
spotless mind, I thought it looked like an okay movie. It looked like
something I wouldn't enjoy, and to be completely honest, I thought a
little less of it knowing that Jim Carrey was to be playing such a
serious role. Now, almost a year later, I sat down in front of my
television and nearly hit myself for not watching it sooner.<br /><br />ESOTSM was one of the most amazing movies I have seen in awhile. It had
an original story line, unlike most of the movies you see these days.
From the moment it started, I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen.
Every single part of this movie, including the parts that made me want
to cry, were done beautifully. There are memorable moments where the
words just stick with you long after the movie is done, and scenes
where you feel as though you are living through Joel or Clemetine's
pain.<br /><br />Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey did such justice to their characters,
saying each line as if it wasn't scripted at all. If not said already,
I think this was their best movies yet, for all the cast and crew
alike. I cannot stress enough how completely wrong I was about Jim
Carrey's work in this movie, he really blew me away!<br /><br />If you don't enjoy this movie for it's amazing story line, or the
amazing job done by the cast, you will definitely notice the poetry of
each word said. One scene in which Kirsten Dunst's character Mary is
reciting lines from Alexander Pope's poem &quot;Eloisa to Abelard&quot; had me
hooked. I've never enjoyed a script as much as this one.<br /><br />All in all, I highly suggest this movie to anyone who has the time to
sit down for 2hours. I don't think you'll be disappointed!
