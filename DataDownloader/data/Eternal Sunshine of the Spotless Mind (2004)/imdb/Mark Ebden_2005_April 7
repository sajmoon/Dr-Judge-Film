This film is often misunderstood so my review may seem unusual. Overall
I enjoyed this movie.<br /><br />Joel (Jim Carrey) pops pills two or three times in the film. I believe
he is a psychiatric patient, for example suffering from a personality
disorder. This is NOT a science fiction film about mind erasing
machines, or a romance film exploring the good and bad of
relationships. Clementine is imaginary, as is Lacuna. One episode of
pill-popping is accompanied by strange music and paranoia, so the pills
are not exactly vitamins!<br /><br />The memorabilia Joel has collected contain no evidence that he and
Clementine were in a real relationship. There are no photos of the two
of them together; rather, the photos of Kate on her own, and the crazy
sketches of the couple, seem to be the belongings of a mad stalker.
Kate and Joel even have a casual conversation about stalking early in
the film.<br /><br />My interpretation of Eternal Sunshine as an exploration of psychosis
runs as follows. A few years before the film begins, Joel is an extreme
introvert dating a woman called Naomi. His mental instabilities
increase and one day at a Montauk beach party, missing Naomi and
sitting quietly away from everyone, he even imagines meeting another
person, Clementine. This girl is probably based on a (real) Barnes &amp;
Noble employee he had seen earlier. She seems real enough to him that
Joel breaks up with his girlfriend Naomi.<br /><br />Joel's psychiatrist (Dr. Howard Mierzwiak) prescribes medication to
return him to normal. Deep down, part of Joel rebels against this,
since a return to normal would necessarily strip him of the abnormal
life he has come to lead (characterised in part by a fictitious
relationship with 'Clementine').<br /><br />The doctor's drugs appear to Joel as a mind-erasing 'machine', which
can attack him at any moment (we see scenes of the machine in his
doctor's office, in the street, and especially in his bed where he
likes to spend a lot of time, being an introvert). The machine is just
Joel's active imagination making tangible something he doesn't quite
understand. The sick part of Joel wants to fight back, so he tries to
entrench Clementine in his memory - witness the scenes where she runs
through his childhood.<br /><br />Eventually the drugs work, and Clementine is repressed. Her 'dying'
words are 'meet me in Montauk', the place he first imagined her
(Montauk is an anagram of 'nut amok', interestingly. Probably just a
coincidence...). Joel gets back together with Naomi (this is most
evident from one of the deleted scenes, where he is calling Naomi as
her reinstated boyfriend) and life is normal again.<br /><br />Then one day for a reason unknown to him at the time (perhaps he had
skipped his medication that day), he plays hooky on work and takes the
train to Montauk. The rediscovery of Clementine is not rapid or
obvious; but by the end of the day their relationship is
re-established. (In a deleted scene, Joel then calls Naomi and breaks
up with her for the second time.) His personality disorder is back in
full swing. He even remembers the earlier episode of 'mind erasure'
(success with the medication) via an audio tape (again a product of his
imagination, in his search for tangibility) and is repulsed that he let
the erasure happen.<br /><br />Where did the name Lacuna come from? In one of the first scenes of the
film, Joel happens to look at his neighbour's mail, and feeling
paranoid at that moment, thinks that the return address (&quot;Lacuna&quot;)
might represent something significant. Later he works the name into his
explanations of what is going on in his head.<br /><br />Does my interpretation sound far-fetched? Well, take the example of
Stan and Mary jumping half-naked on their patient's bed: I believe it
is more credible to interpret that as a figment of Joel's mind, rather
than the truth.<br /><br />markebden@hotmail.com
