And now that everything has come to an end, it&#39;ll start all over again.
If you smile, I&#39;ll smile with you; if you cry, I&#39;ll cry with you. Paths
are so confused and sings so dimmed that souls can find each other just
listening to the sweet sound of silence, no need for suggestions or
words of wisdom. It&#39;s all about beats now, in this new state of eternal
birth and death, walking down this empty road that will lead you to
that place you already know, even if you&#39;re not aware of it. Please
believe in feelings and destinies, and your sun will shine again soon.
I wish I could tell you the secrets of love, but I don&#39;t have a clue. I
just do know that I feel you more than anyone else, even though I&#39;ve
never met you before. Your eyes are saying it&#39;s all true and it&#39;s all
happened before. Tell me what it feels like to be new again. Tell me
what it feels like to eat the wind and breath the water, tell me what
it feels like being scared of your future but wanting it at the same
time, tell me all this and I&#39;ll heal your heart over and over again.
