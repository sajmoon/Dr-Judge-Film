Charlie Kaufman, seemingly one of today's hottest screenwriters, serves
up another strangely cerebral concept with Eternal Sunshine of the
Spotless Mind. If you're a fan of the guy's work, you'll probably find
this one a delightful treat too. What really struck me was the
emotional relationship between the characters portrayed by Jim Carrey
and Kate Winslet&#133;it was at least believable, if not realistic. But I
guess that's sort of the point of the movie, an exploration of personal
relationships (through a weird, scifi-like journey of the mind). In the
end though, while I did enjoy the movie, at 32 on the IMDb 250, I think
it's highly overrated.
