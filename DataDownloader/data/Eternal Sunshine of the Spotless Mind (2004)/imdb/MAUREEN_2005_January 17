I was pleasantly surprised at the depth and poignancy of this movie.
Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are fantastic! Their acting brings much
more to the movie than just dialogue. Although they wanted their
memories erased at first, it was only because they loved each other so
much. This love causes them to constantly bicker and disagree, but they
didn't realize how lucky they were to have each other until they almost
lost each other forever. Really there are very few people in life worth
erasing forever. I actually can think of 2 people I'd gladly erase from
my life. The only reason I might not erase them is because I learned a
lot from the experiences and I do not want to make those same mistakes
again. Joel and Clementine have something so special that when they
meet a second time as strangers, they still find a connection! It does
seem that they are soul mates. They realize that they want the same
things in life, but not necessarily in the same order. They must agree
to disagree and not take every discussion as a personal attack. This
movie makes you think so much about your own love life and friends that
it's frightening! This is one of the few movies that you will continue
to think about long after you've seen it.<br /><br />Winslet and Carrey definitely deserved their Golden Globe nominations.
This movie is a must see!
