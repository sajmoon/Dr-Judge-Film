Kind of a cheesy headline, I guess, but that's the feeling I had when
having watched this movie. That is - not exactly the thought that this
reminded me of &quot;The Matrix&quot;, but a very similar sense of sensory
overload, having watched a cutting edge piece of work, and at the same
time having been touched by a great story.<br /><br />Even though I've seen several Charlie Kaufman movies and liked them
all, I never expected this to actually be able to take the concept of a
&quot;love movie&quot; and mix it with the Kaufman-style of realism combined with
his quirky, signature experimentalism.<br /><br />Well what more can I say.. it's a good one, highly recommended. I'll
definitively watch it again. C. Kaufman is like the big director of our
time, enjoy it as long as it lasts..
