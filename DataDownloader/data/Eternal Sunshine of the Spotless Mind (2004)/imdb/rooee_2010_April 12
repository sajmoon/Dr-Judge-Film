Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s better-received Being John Malkovich was
an amusing but cold oddity; director Michel Gondry&#x27;s Science of Sleep
was not particularly amusing and sickly cute. Sandwiched between was
this loving, subtly cautionary romantic &#x27;dramedy&#x27; about a young man,
Joel (Jim Carrey), undergoing a fantastical scientific operation to
remove all memory of his ex-girlfriend, the eccentric Clementine (Kate
Winslet). The procedure draws him deep into his subconscious, and we&#x27;re
invited along for the ride. This second collaboration between Kaufman
and Gondry (after 2001&#x27;s Human Nature) has deservedly become something
of a cult favourite.<br /><br />Forget Garden State: while Eternal Sunshine shares a desire to explore
the truth behind the human condition through a skewed fish-eye lens, it
is mercifully free of that film&#x27;s cloying sentimentality, its
narcissism, and its contempt for a mainline predefined as banal. In
Garden State, people are kooky but phony, shallow and self-absorbed;
Eternal Sunshine&#x27;s Joel, meanwhile, is powerless against his absorption
into the strange fearful passions of his dreams. With impressive
psychological literacy, Kaufman and Gondry&#x27;s film shows us the
selfishness of human desire and are - crucially - critical of it.
Hollywood loves nothing more than to make lovers of ill-suited
characters thrown together by circumstance. Not so here: the joy of
watching Joel and Clementine&#x27;s relationship blossom - and fade - is
that it is a product of choice as much as chance, and so it is
believable.<br /><br />Winslet puts in a signature performance; her Clementine is the
extrovert to Carrey&#x27;s Joel. Carrey, meanwhile, scribbles out his
signature entirely: nary a mug passes across his face. His is a soulful
turn of poise and intelligence.<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine finds its home on DVD - by the third or fourth viewing
you should have the fractured narrative pretty much sussed. Plus, it&#x27;s
ideal night-in viewing: warm, friendly, funny, and profound. In a
cynical and ironic era, it&#x27;s heartening to watch a film that finds love
so alive and so precious. A classic.
