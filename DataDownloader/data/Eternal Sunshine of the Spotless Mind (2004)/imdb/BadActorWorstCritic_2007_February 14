2007_February 14 
One day, I was &quot;sick&quot; at home (there was a horrible math quiz that day
which I hadn&#39;t even begun to study for) rummaging through a cabinet
full of DVDs and VHS tapes when I came across one I&#39;d never heard of
before. It starred Jim Carrey, so, being a fan of him, I popped it into
the DVD player, and pushed &quot;play.&quot; WOAH. I had no idea what I&#39;d gotten
into. This film: charming, sweet, subtle, smart, original and unusual,
pulled me into a tangled web of love and pain and never let go. From
the very first scene: a lonely Carrey riding a train; to the last, you
are thrown into a tale that tears at your heart and challenges your
brain in tender but heartbreaking ways. The visual effects are
phenomenal, my personal favorite of an entire house decomposing in the
matter of seconds, just as the memory is. Carrey, Kate Winslet, and the
rest of the cast melt into the characters, embracing their attributes
as if born to them. When the last scene fades to the credits, you&#39;ll be
speechless at the film you just witnessed.
