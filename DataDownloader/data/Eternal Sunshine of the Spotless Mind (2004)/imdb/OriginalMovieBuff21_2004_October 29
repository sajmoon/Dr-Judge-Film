Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of those movies that gets
you hooked to your seat and try to find the clues for this puzzel. This
was the #1 film I have wanted to see the whole year. I never got to see
it in theaters, which I wanted to, and now I finally got to rent it at
blockbuster. I really like films like these that have a weird meaning
to the movie and a lot of things jus change around that confuse you.
The acting of this successful film was incredible especially by Jim
Carrey, Mark Ruffalo, and Kate Winslet along with Elijah Wood and Tom
Wilkinson. If you watch this film, look very hard into it and try to
see what its saying. A very fascinating film that I am glad to finally
see.<br /><br />Hedeen's outlook: 8.5/10 ***+ B+
