This movie was simply fabulous. There's no other word for it. I loved
Jim Carrey in the Truman Show, thought he was robbed in that case as
well. But this movie was just so beautiful, and moving, and
thought-provoking. What would you do if you could erase someone from
your memory? From all aspects of your life? Would you do it? Should you
do it? Jim Carrey played the seemingly straight man to Kate Winslet's
zaney Clementine. And yet, they were such a great compliment to each
other. In a way, you begin to see that perhaps she dyes her hair such
wild colors to cover up her insecurities. And Jim Carrey is a quiet
soul, with a lot of energy behind it that Clementine brings out.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil anything, but the ending is rather a surprise,
and you don't end up where you thought you would. The entire movie is
shot beautifully, and just thinking about the creativity behind it,
gives me chills. It's such an awesome concept, and if you loved this,
you'll really love Adaptation, by the same makers.<br /><br />The supporting cast is great as well, with the exception of Elijah Wood
who seemed very misplaced and lost in the film. But watch this, and see
what a great actor Jim Carrey can be when he's not in knee-slapper
comedies. I love him in those as well, but it's a sham that the
critical acclaim seems to always pass him by.<br /><br />One of my favorites!
