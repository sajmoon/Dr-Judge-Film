Eternal Sunshine marks the second collaboration between the writer and
director that I am aware of, the first being Human Nature. While Nature
was an excellent film-- well-cast, well-written, and well-shot--
Eternal Sunshine is a more intricate work. The storyline is quite a
good deal more involved and may be Kaufman's most emotional work yet
(Adaptation being the possible exception). Gondry, directing with what
can only be assumed to have been a much larger budget, skillfully
manipulated every visual, sonic, and temporal aspect of the film,
moving us through it in a style which is all his own. This film
reflects more the energy and pace of Gondry's music videos than that of
Human Nature, which is by no means a fault. The opposite is true:
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is easily the most recognizable
film of the year it was released, thanks to the storytelling ability of
Charlie Kaufman and the virtuosic powers of presentation possessed by
Michel Gondry.
