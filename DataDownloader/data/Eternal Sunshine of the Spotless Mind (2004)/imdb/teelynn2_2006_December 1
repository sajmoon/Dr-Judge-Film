I really enjoyed this movie because first of all, I am a huge Jim
Carrey fan, and second of all, it is nice to see the serious side of
him in a movie and have it turn out right. I think that this movie has
a great twist in it, it caught me off guard and I had to watch the
movie twice to make sure I got the whole thing. Jim Carrey along with
Kate Winslet and the rest of the cast, did a great job in this movie,
and not only could i not tear myself away from it, I found that I my
face was mimicking any emotions that were being displayed throughout
the entire movie. This movie is one that you have to give your
undivided attention to, because if you don&#39;t, you are sure to miss
something. Trust me, if you miss anything in this movie, it is hard to
catch up to what is happening. The effects in the movie were also
great,I very much enjoyed the way they put this whole thing together.
There are parts of the movie that rely on only the effects, and if they
were not present, there would be absolutely no point to the story.
