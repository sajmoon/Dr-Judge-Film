I saw this movie and I loved it at once. I'm a big Jim Carrey fan and
that was one of the main reasons I went to see it. But also because it
got good reviews. And I must say that this is one of the best movies
ever made. It's really beautiful, the actors are great, they play real
good, and the story is just incredible. I was a little bit confused at
the beginning of the movie, but that didn't take long. The scene in the
house, were Joel and Clementine first met, was one of the best scenes
in the story. when they both realize they won't remember each other and
Joel just says: enjoy it. This movie is an example of one with a nice
deep vision and I strongly recommend to everybody to go and see this
movie. you won't regret it !
