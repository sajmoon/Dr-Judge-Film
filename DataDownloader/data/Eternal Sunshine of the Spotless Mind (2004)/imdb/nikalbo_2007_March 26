WOW. what a movie - this one of my favorite movies of all time, and if
there was a perfect movie, in my mind, this is it. This is why:<br /><br />There are movies like the recently released 300 that are low-brow but
entertaining purely for their visceral delights - they hold your
attention, amaze you, but they offer nothing to think about. Accepting
them for what they are, they have their own merits. While they are
empty - all fat and calories and no nutrients - I will continue to
watch these &quot;blockbuster&quot; popcorn movies on opening night.<br /><br />Then there are the intellectual movies, so absorbed by themselves that
they loose their audience. They set out with the goal of enlightening
you, changing you - but they have the tendency to be tasteless and
bland. The worst one that comes to mind being &quot;Waking Life&quot;. This one
actually tried to be eye-candy, but it bored me to tears. The
philosophical musings themselves were interesting but basically it was
a college lecture in CG graphics. Sophomoric at best, I would have
watched Die Hard instead if I had the choice. It lost me at about 25
minutes in...and the theory, thoughts, and the message went through one
ear and out the other...<br /><br />The best movies in my mind transcend themselves and become experiences.
They leave you with something, you learn from them, you think about
them, they influence how you think about yourself and how you see the
world. However, they also fulfill what a movie is supposed to do -
entertain. Eternal Sunshine did this - and left me with something new,
something I could think about and bring into my life, and at the same
time, it held me, entertained me. That is a rare achievement in my
mind.<br /><br />Make no mistake, Eteranal is a movie that demands your full attention.
Even so, it warrants a second and third viewing to fully grasp the
beauty of this film. The jumps in the story can disorient and I can see
how some will be put off by this. However, if you watch carefully and
are able to understand this you will realize the beauty and craft
behind the mixed pieces scattered throughout the film.<br /><br />I haven&#39;t seen a movie that captures the feeling of a &quot;dream&quot; like
Eternal. You will see the absurd, and the surreal...and yet it in your
gut it makes sense - just like dreaming. Needless to say, what you will
see will arrest you. The direction alone is a masterpiece - the scenes
are loaded with creativity, and there are times where you will go &quot;how
the hell did they shoot that?&quot;. Gondry should have won an Oscar for
this.<br /><br />Finally, I have looked at a lot of the discussion around this film, and
while the central themes remain the same, what people have taken away
from the film seems to vary - there are different levels to the film
beyond the visceral, which is already amazing in and of itself. The
tone of Eternal is melancholic, however IMO it&#39;s message is very
positive. Eternal&#39;s message to me is this...when you try to forget the
pain, be it a person or an experience, you forget all the good that
came with it.<br /><br />Go watch this movie!
