A perfect theme have not used yet, fascinating story. The vital
component of romantic movies are soundtracks, it is unsuccessful. I
think the biggest mistake of director, Michel gondry, is selection of
soundtracks. Then casting Jim Carey is not pertinent for this movie.
The director has sacrificed the history gorgeously.The keys of the
movie are acting and soundtracks. i think the best of the movie is
Kirsten Dunst who acting best specially at last part of the movie, she
can reflect the piece of romanticism at the last part. Finally this
movie should be seen but it can not match with fascinate and
romanticism. Director is really unsuccessful.<br /><br />Suha Berk
