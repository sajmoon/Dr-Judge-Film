This movie gives us what we all secretly wish for-- a chance to forget
something that's hurt us in the past. The viewer can almost live
vicariously through the two dysfunctional characters that are
remarkably just like ordinary people. The relationship problems are the
same. The little fights and bickers are things we all can relate to.
The acting was amazing- throughout the movie, I actually forgot that I
was watching Mr. Ace Ventura himself. Carrey and Winslet pull off a
great performance, both ditching the typecasts that they've been
shackled with. Not only did the film give us the opportunity to see
what it was like if painful memories were erased, but it also gave us
the opportunity to see that everything deserves a second chance. The
way it ends leaves the viewer to imagine how the characters' lives will
end. The idealist may say that they lived happily ever after; the
pessimist may say that they just reverted to disliking each other
again. Either way, it leaves you to imagining your own ending; a
characteristic many films leave out. Basically, this movie makes you
think, &quot;What if...?&quot; It truly gives new meaning to the phrase &quot;You
never know what you've got until it's gone.&quot;
