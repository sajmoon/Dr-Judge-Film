One of the most original films i have seen in years.<br /><br />Its heartwarming yet turbulent race through the film always keeps you
on your toes and you do have to think about it.<br /><br />From the whole way through the film you can relate to Carrey as more
than a rubber faced comedian and as a genuine actor, if you have to see
this film it must be to see a performance by Carrey that truly rivals
many Oscar winners.<br /><br />At no point during the film did i feel that i was bored or felt like
stopping it, i got dragged in and if you could only see one film then i
would place this at the top<br /><br />I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone as IMO it was one of
the best films i have seen in years which everyone should see and love.
