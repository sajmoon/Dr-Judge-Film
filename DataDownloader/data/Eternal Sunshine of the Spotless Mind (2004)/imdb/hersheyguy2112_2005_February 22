The movie made its point well enough. Sometimes in the midsts of
arguments and problems, you forget the wonderful things you have. But
understanding this movie did not help me to like it.<br /><br />The movie was very slow-moving. It was over seventeen minutes before
the credits started rolling. I did not like any of the characters very
much, although I did feel for them. Life can be painful. But is it
truly worth eliminating everything associated with someone (or even a
pet) to get rid of the bad? As the plot progressed, I felt an
increasing desire to turn it off and leave. I had already decided for
myself on the point the movie made, so to me it was a sad story that I
would rather not ever think about again.
