I really think this movie was brilliant. I know that I, for one, and I
would imagine many others, have wished to erase bad memories, and I'm
glad that someone was brave enough to explore that common thought in
the cinema. I was astounded by Jim Carrey's performance, as I'd never
seen him in so moving a film. Kate Winslet was fantastic as well. Even
though I highly suggest seeing this film, to this day I'm not sure
whether I actually LIKED it or not. It's really a great movie, but it
left me feeling a little disturbed, as I suppose it should have. I
would really like to see it again so I can make up my mind. I feel that
after another viewing, I could decide I hate this movie... or that it's
one of my favorites. Regardless of my opinion, I think that you should
see this movie if you haven't already.
