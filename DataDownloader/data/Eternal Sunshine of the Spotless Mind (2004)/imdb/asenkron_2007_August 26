We are used to hear this concept about chips or digitally worked
microbrains. But, this concept is dealed with about humans in this
film. Although the people whose brains are purified any kind of
knowledge, &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; slips off and it
goes to the fact that it should happen anyway. Joel and Clementine
whose are the main characters of story realize that sentence in this
film and teaches us &quot;how to reach special person&quot;. According to story
of film, Joel and Clementine meet nearby a coast coincidentally. By the
time, their relation goes forward and comes to the point that is end.
After both of them restarted their brains to forget about past, they
meet each other again. Finally, we should present our thanks to
director, scenarist, actors and actresses to create such an interesting
film.
