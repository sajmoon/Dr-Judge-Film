This is the first time I have liked anything Jim Carrey has done - what
a pleasure to see him play a quiet, understated role; I fell a bit in
love with that character! So typical for Kaufman, the story is quirky,
highly original and funny. The scenes of the Stan and Mary, the Carrey
and the Winslet characters cavorting and playing together are so sweet
and funny and human, it gave me a bit of a pang, me who has been alone
for so long. As painful as human interaction can be, as much as you
might want to forget certain screw-ups that you have made in your life,
much there is sweet and should be cherished forever (my personal
subtext that I inject into the movie). Go - you will not regret it.
