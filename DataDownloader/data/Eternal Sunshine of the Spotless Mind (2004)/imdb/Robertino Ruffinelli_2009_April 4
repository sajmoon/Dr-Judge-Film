This movie is extremely rare. But I say that in he good way. It&#x27;s hard
to find a moving film like this one. That is why I think that Eternal
Sunshine of the Spotless mind is beyond reason. But love is beyond
reason as well, and that is what this film is about.<br /><br />Everyone can relate to this movie, because who didn&#x27;t suffer for love
sometime? Love is a complex concept that can&#x27;t be explained. This movie
shows us that like no other could. This is the opposite of all romantic
movies. It&#x27;s very original and very warn as it is sad as well. Both
main actors gave excellent performances and their relationship felt
authentic like no other relationship on screen.<br /><br />Jim Carrey is a really good actor when it comes to drama. I personally
dislike most of his exaggerated comedies but he did a terrific job here
and in The Truman Show for example. I think that he should choose more
carefully his roles, because there are some roles where he can show he
actually has talent. Kate on the other hand is always great.<br /><br />Everyone should take a look on this title since almost everyone can
relate to the characters, and although it&#x27;s a sad movie it is still
highly enjoyable.
