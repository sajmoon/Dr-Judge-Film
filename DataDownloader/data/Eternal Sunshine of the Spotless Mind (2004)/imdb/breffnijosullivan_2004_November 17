How can anyone not love this film. Gondry and Kaufman are geniuses.
This film undoubtedly has the greatest screenplay I've ever come
across, and, what does it for me, the background effects are sumptuous.
Very few films have ever gone into my top 10, but it is only the second
to enter at No. 1. If you haven't seen it, watch it. If you've watched
it, buy it and watch it again. You will pick up so much more the second
time around, and it is apparently unfortunate that this film slipped
through the cracks of cinema? This films is made for people who love
films, not entertainment. Carrey proved that he is not a one trick
pony, but a multi-furlong stallion. This multigenre film has enabled
everyone to look at films and to see what can be done behind the hype.
In short, then, a future legend in film. Winslet, however, captures the
escence of her role so brilliantly, that combined with Carrey, the
superb cuts, the ample direction of Gondry, and the superb screenplay
of Kaufman, make this film One of the greats.
