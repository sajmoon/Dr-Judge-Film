I have to admit, I am sorry, but I don&#x27;t like the film. It&#x27;s been two
years since I first watched it, and with a poor memory like mine, I
have completely forgotten what it is all about. The only memory I have
about it is the essay I wrote as an assignment, from which I know I
didn&#x27;t feel a thing about it as many people do. I also remember one of
its lesson, that is you can&#x27;t just ignore your mistakes, you have to
look them in the face&#x97;look them really hard to be able to learn
something from them&#x97;otherwise you are gonna to make the same mistakes
again and again. Unless you make a change, this will be a never-ending
process. Lots of things have happened since the latter half of last
year. I have experienced many frustrations, I have been under huge
stress, and I began to be aware of my own existence again&#x97;the last time
that I did was in my junior year, when I was involved in a vortex of
mixed feelings dealing with my contenting roommates. When I repeatedly
make the same mistakes, the lesson of the film comes to me, and I tell
myself: &#x22;See how you got here. You are careless to the lessons life
teaches you. Be smart next time.&#x22; Therefore, I want to watch the film
again, to see if I will change my mind, since it has such a depth, it
helps me avoid old mistakes. But after I finished it, I still don&#x27;t
like it. I did change, however. The problem with it, as I see it this
time, is with the way the director presents it. The humor, which he may
think as a plus or as something that will make it entertaining, is
exactly what ruins the film. He could have reduced some of the humorous
scenes because they don&#x27;t fit in with the whole tone. For example,
people will laugh when they know that the young guy from the clinic
steals Clement&#x27;s underwear. But what&#x27;t the point of that? Or, the scene
that while Joel is trying hard to keep his memory, Mary and Stan were
actually having a party on his bed. Maybe he wants to indicate the
absurdity of the whole erasing thing, or that&#x27;s his satire of the
commercial world where people only care about money and are not
sympathetic to your feelings, but he could have used another way. The
sad love story and the kinds of humor of irresponsibility and all form
a really weird combination. It may be better if the director sticks
with only one of them. As for the love part, I don&#x27;t feel a thing,
either. Maybe I have passed the stage of life when you dream about a
person who will love you as if you are the only thing he has. Rather, I
respect the fact that we are two equal people, we have our own
concerns, and we are together because we seem to form good partners to
live the rest of our lives. I don&#x27;t want him to interfere with my life
too much, because there are many things to do except love. By the way,
Jim Carrey is very handsome!
