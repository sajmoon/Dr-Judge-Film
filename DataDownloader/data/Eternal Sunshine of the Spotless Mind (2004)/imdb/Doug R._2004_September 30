A great directing job, balancing originality, striking scenes &amp; purely
original drama, while not losing focus<br /><br />and the audience. So incredibly refreshing to see something like this
...an unobstructed, inner-feeling type piece that everyone<br /><br />can relate to, and is utterly captivated by a movie telling<br /><br />you that &quot;your eyes cannot move from the screen!&quot; Most importantly, it
made me think and it was deep &amp; rich,<br /><br />but it wont take days to figure it out! It hits you hard, and just
stays in your mind for awhile after the movie is over.<br /><br />Great job by a great cast &amp; truly innovative, brilliant visionary of a
director!
