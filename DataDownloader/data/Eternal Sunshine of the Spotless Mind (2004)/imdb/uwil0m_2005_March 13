The author of the story has excellent insight into the workings of
relationships. I've been in a great relationship for 20 years but still
feel like I'm learning from the failed relationships that preceded the
successful one. We all have to learn from our mistakes, not run from
them. The author did a great job in pointing out if we try to run from
the negative memories, we just go around in circles. It is a pretty
good analogy for not using drugs to run from uncomfortable memories. It
would be interesting to know if that was in the mind of the author.
This is the first time I've enjoyed a movie with Jim C. starring in it.
He really is a good dramatic actor. He was smooth and in control. Kate
W. was wonderful as always. Elijah W. took some chances with his role.
I respect him more for that. This is definitely a movie that will be
remembered.
