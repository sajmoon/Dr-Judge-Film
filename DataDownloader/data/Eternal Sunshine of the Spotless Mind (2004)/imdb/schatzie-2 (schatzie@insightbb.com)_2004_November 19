We found parallels to our own lives. The story line was unique. Both
Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet did an incredible job. It was great seeing
Jim Carrey do a role outside his comedic self. Uplifting and confirming
that true love will prevail and find itself no matter where it hides.
One of the two of us who saw this movie would erase each other if it
would truly work but this movie illustrates that you cannot hide from
your destiny. You cannot choose who you love and who is your soul mate.
If only you could. Eternal Sunshine makes this point loud and clear. A
great date movie. Should be nominated for an academy award for several
categories including best original screenplay and best actor and
actress.
