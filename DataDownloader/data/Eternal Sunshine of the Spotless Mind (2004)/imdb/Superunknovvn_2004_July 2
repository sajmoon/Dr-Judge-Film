There&#39;s only one way to describe &quot;Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless
Mind&quot;: perfect. It&#39;s been one week since I saw the movie and I still
cannot stop thinking about it. Was the ending happy or sad? I cannot
tell, but it&#39;s deeply touching.<br /><br />Charlie Kaufman is incredible. How does he come up with all these
original, flawless scripts? Finally there&#39;s someone who uses the
possibilities of cinema to the fullest. I love the way Kaufman shows
the fate of individuals and derives universally true rules from it. The
content of his story is always highly philosophical without ever being
smart alec.<br /><br />Some say &quot;Eternal Sunshine...&quot; was over-directed. I disagree. Having
read the script, I know that Gondry deserves lots of credit for
bringing this beautiful story to life. Sure, there are five creepy
images per minute, but have you ever seen such an original, weird
picture? Mind you, I&#39;m not saying that lots of effects automatically
make for a good direction, but in this case it really helped to
underline the story, not distracting from it.<br /><br />Jim Carrey... wow! I&#39;ve always liked him as the hilarious Comedian he
is, but I never thought that his performances in &quot;The Truman Show&quot; and
&quot;Man On The Moon&quot; were that much of a departure from his funny-man
side. As Joel, however, he is a completely different person. It&#39;s like
Jim Carrey had a serious twin brother. Unbelievable. I bow to this
performance! Give this man more chances to show his acting abilities, I
say!<br /><br />Finally I have to mention Beck&#39;s cover of &quot;Everybody&#39;s Gotta Learn
Sometime&quot;, which fits perfectly into the movie and won&#39;t leave my
CD-Player for the next months.<br /><br />A movie like &quot;Eternal Sunshine...&quot; really shows how much time and money
Hollywood wastes on producing crap like &quot;Bad Boys&quot; or &quot;The Fast &amp; The
Furious&quot;, and its box office result demonstrates how little people care
about quality in movies. Personally, I have found my first contender
for best motion picture of the year. I need to see the movie again,
because I have a feeling that this one gets even better with each
viewing. I can&#39;t wait until it&#39;s released on DVD.<br /><br />I feel the need to say more, but I can&#39;t put my feelings into (English)
words. All I can say is: GO SEE THIS MOVIE! You won&#39;t regret it.
