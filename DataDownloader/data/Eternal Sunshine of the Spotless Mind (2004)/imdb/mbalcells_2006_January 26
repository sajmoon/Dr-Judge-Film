Finally Carey has shown the actor he had inside!! The rest of the cast
is also brilliant, even Elijah wood doesn't recall he was in lord of
the rings. The music is awesome, the filming and photography amazing,
it's a shame I didn't know about this movie before. It's one of those
movies you can't figure out the hole plot from the beginning, and I
think that is very good nowadays where movie writers don't seem to find
any new stories. I recommend to watch it without reading anything about
it. The plot will surprise you, make you laugh and think. The only
thing I found quite weird but acceptable for plot purposes is that with
such high-tech machines that can erase your memory, people are still
using tapes for audio recording.
