It's arrived! A truly original and provocative film (and it includes
special effects!). The combined talents of great actors and people
disapearing in front of your eyes. Forget about Michael Bay. This film
has that scenerio of special effects without becoming dumber. But, on a
serious note. Carrey delivered and Oscar worthy performance. It's great
to finally see a film that has creativeness (see I make up words,
that's creative) to it's context. There are few movies coming out in
the last 5 years that have made you truly believe, &quot;Damn that was a
cool movie!&quot;. What's even more amazing is that there were no exploding
cars or robots taking over the world.
