You just have to see it at least twice to appreciate it. It&#39;s the talk
of the town that movies based on Charlie Kaufman scripts are not for
everyone. One of the better qualities of the movie is that you might
not expect it to be a sci-fi. It&#39;s full of surprises. I&#39;ve heard people
walked out on it in theaters, probably expecting another mediocre Jim
Carrey comedy. Too bad for them.<br /><br />It&#39;s not as dark as Being John Malkovich, though it is deeper. The two
main characters do not seem as neurotic as their Kaufman based
&#39;predecessors&#39;. Although they are still insecure, somewhat in doubt and
&#39;looking for their own piece of mind&#39;. That&#39;s why we like them so much.
Their seemingly insignificant inner characteristics can be easily
exposed to a two hour &#39;investigation&#39;. And that&#39;s pretty much what all
the movies that have been written by Charlie Kaufman are about. Each
time, the audience is sent on a brief inner expedition, into a not so
prominent individual. <br /><br />Besides the story it is all enriched with excellent music. A calm
little tune is played every now and then that makes the whole thing
more memorable. After it&#39;s all said and done a mix of bitter-sweet
sensation takes you over. And you feel the need for love, like the
eternal sunshine.<br /><br />........ +4/5 ........
