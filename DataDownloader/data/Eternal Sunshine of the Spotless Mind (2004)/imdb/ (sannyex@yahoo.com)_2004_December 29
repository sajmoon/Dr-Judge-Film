The technical process (erasing all or parts of human memory) does not
appeal to me. Trying to create a plot, drama, conflict using this is
quite risky. Most of human situations happens in a linear time line.
Any warps (back &amp; forth, erasure movements in the story) will risk
enjoyment and appreciation of this natural and standard processing of
reflection. Frankly, achieving artistry on a technical platform has
always been unattractive to me, let alone a memory one. A deus ex
machina will be the maximum technique I can tolerate.<br /><br />The portrayal of romance by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslett are very good.
By the time viewers like me 'catch on,' there is only so little time
left for the 'emotional gravity' that has been sorted to take effect.
Maybe, when tweaking memory is perfected like the other techniques of
cinematic belief suspension, the time budget of the movie can
accommodate this and its consequent appreciation. Just one average
moviegoer's opinion.
