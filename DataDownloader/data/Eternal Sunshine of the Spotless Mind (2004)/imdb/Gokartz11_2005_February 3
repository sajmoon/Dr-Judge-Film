This was an absolutely amazing movie. When I rented it, I thought that
it would be another lame attempt of a comedian trying to make it in a
serious movie. It is difficult to follow in the beginning, but once it
all comes together it is an amazing film. Jim Carrey, and Kate Winslet
do a marvelous job putting you in a different emotional place than any
other movie can. It shows you a different perspective when you look at
a relationship. It shows that bad memories are always wanted to be
forgotten, but if you realize all of the good times, then you do not
want to lose it all. This is one of my all time favorite movies, and is
very worthy of seeing!!
