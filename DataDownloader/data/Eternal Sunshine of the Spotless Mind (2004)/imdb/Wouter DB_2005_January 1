This movie is very hard to describe... I just watched it, alone, with
nobody around...I just felt...I dunno...It's a movie that really drags
oneself right into the story, you get really touched while watching
this movie. I can't come up with ANY movie that comes even near this
story, it's really one of a kind. It's also amazing to see Jim Carrey
playing such a role... All my favorite movies have gone down one spot
just so this one could be at the top...After the movie was over, I just
watched the credits go by as I was really stunned by the movie...my
eyes were open but I wasn't looking.<br /><br />This movie is ... amazing
