without knowing sadness how can we know what is happiness? without the
baggage or lessons of the past how can we be ready to face the future?
without all the different perspectives, emotions or the people in the
memories to share with how can any of our memories be true? I think the
movie is asking these questions. And to come to this point, I had to
dissociate with the movie for a while, leave it alone, let it stir in
my mind. Because when I first and again saw this film, the emotional
tone set by the cinematography, color palette, performance, dialogue,
time line, and of course imaginary scenes, was overwhelming.<br /><br />The whole presentation and structure evokes a kind of freedom and that
reflects on it's characters and their imagination, and sadly this will
somewhat limit the film to appeal to a similar kind of audience too.<br /><br />The film is an articulate reflection of the mind, possibly comments on
our instincts and behavioral hiccups of the human nature, and the
utter, indescribable, unpredictable, unrelenting, mess of a chaos of
that is the love from the 2 opposite central characters.<br /><br />Jim Carey is flabbergastingly real world and Kate Winslet can finally
erase Titanic from our memory.
