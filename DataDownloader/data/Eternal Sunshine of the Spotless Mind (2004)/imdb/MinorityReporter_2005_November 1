This is probably my favorite Jim Carrey movie. In this film we see a
strangely subdued and vulnerable Jim Carrey not being up to his usual
tricks and it works beautifully. We saw some of Carrey&#39;s dramatic
potential in The Truman Show (also an excellent Jim Carrey film) but in
this one he goes all out. Dramatically speaking. Eternal Sunshine of
the Spotless Mind is above all a love story but it does indeed have an
interesting approach to the subject. I don&#39;t want to give a summary of
the film and I don&#39;t think it would be entirely possible because being
a true Charlie Kaufman (the writer) movie its really kind of weird and
at some points you have no idea what is happening. However, unlike
Being John Malkovich (1999) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
doesn&#39;t seem quite as pretentious in spite of the fact that it stares
more mainstream actors as the main characters.<br /><br />The acting is top notch. Jim Carrey has his performance of a lifetime
and truly proves that the type casting he usually seems to be a victim
of can be broken. I have never seen Jim Carrey in a role like this
before and I must admit going into the film I had my doubts about his
abilities (I am not saying I don&#39;t enjoy his acting generally speaking
I just didn&#39;t know if Carrey could go all the way through with it) but
my concerns were quickly put to rest. Carrey&#39;s performance is spot on
and his emotional range is considerable. Kate Winslet plays the female
lead and having only seen her in Titanic prior to this film I thought
she would suck. She didn&#39;t, however and I was happy to hear that she
had been nominated for an Oscar because her performance is worthy of
one. Her performance seems very genuine and above all real. Her
reactions are totally believable and her on screen chemistry with
Carrey is incredible. Very, very well done. Elijah Wood stares in this
film as well and the people who have only seen him in The Lord of the
Rings are in for a big surprise because (wisely) Wood is putting as
much distance between him and the Frodo character so he won&#39;t get type
casted as the good guy. Believe me his performance is pretty different.
Kirsten Dunst and Mark Ruffalo are in the film as well and while Dunst
was never a good actress her performance in this film is passable.
Ruffalo is pretty good and his scenes with Elijah Wood in particular
are pretty interesting. Last but not least Tom Wilkinson is in the film
as well. His character is pretty limited but Wilkinson does an amazing
job with the character and steals almost every scene he is in.<br /><br />The film has a very interesting and well told story. The final outcome
isn&#39;t always apparent and this is a good thing as it keeps the audience
on its toes through the duration of the film which is about 1&frac12; hour.
Even though the film is relatively short it has a lot of material
crammed into it. Both story wise but also visually and you have to
watch the film twice because of these two things. The film is actually
better the second time you see it because by then you will know the
basic story and can therefore pay more attention to the details and
there are many of them. Even though I have seen the film quite a few
times now (I never seem to get tired of it) I still catch up on some
new ones with every viewing. This is what I think marks a good film.
The fact that you can watch it again and it can still both surprise you
and find new ways of entertaining the audience. In addition to being
constantly surprising the visual style has a very fresh and original
feel and at some times you get the feeling that the director had a lot
of fun with the visual elements and this enthusiasm rubbed off on me as
I watched the film and it makes the film very enthralling.<br /><br />In conclusion Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of the best
films I have ever seen. It was for a while on my top 10 of best films
and even though it isn&#39;t any more it is still a very entertaining,
thought inducing film that deserves all the praise it has gotten so
far. I heartily agree with its rating on IMDb and I hope that people
who watch the film in the future will watch it with an open mind and
not expect another Jim Carrey comedy because it isn&#39;t. I recommend the
film to all lovers of quite weird films because it certainly has its
moments of sheer weirdness but it never loses track of its characters
and where its taking the viewer. All in all.<br /><br />9/10
