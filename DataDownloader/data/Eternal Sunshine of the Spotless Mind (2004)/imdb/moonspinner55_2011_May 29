Director Michel Gondry, whose specialty in music videos was a seamless
visual blending of reality and surreality, was the perfect filmmaker
for this thoughtful, provoking drama which juggles past and present.
Jim Carrey is excellent as a single man looking for love...and perhaps
finding it with eccentric clerk Kate Winslet; unfortunately, a
double-header secret from both their pasts may come back to haunt them.
Gondry, who also worked on the original story with Pierre Bismuth and
screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, is masterful with a flashy scenario (both
figuratively and literally), and he works surprisingly well with his
eclectic group of actors. However, the characters in Kaufman&#x27;s script
aren&#x27;t especially likable (particularly Winslet&#x27;s argumentative
love-interest) and the film is acutely chilly, with everybody bundled
up and shivering. As the plot thickens, it also becomes convoluted
(and, purposely one assumes, splintered); despite some missteps, Gondry
works nimbly steering the viewer through the mechanisms of the
narrative, and there several engaging or arresting sequences. Similar
in tone and spirit to &#x22;Being John Malkovich&#x22;, which Kaufman also wrote,
and blazing with deft, daring originality. **1/2 from ****
