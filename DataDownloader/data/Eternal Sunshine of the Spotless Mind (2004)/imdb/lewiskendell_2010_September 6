&#x22;What a loss to spend that much time with someone, only to find out
that she&#x27;s a stranger.&#x22;<br /><br />Would you want to erase your most painful experiences from your memory,
if you could? Heartbreaks, disappointments, regrets, all gone over the
course of a night? Is there any value in memories from a failed
relationship?<br /><br />Feel free to come to your own answers about all that, but Eternal
Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has it&#x27;s own POV to share. After the
relationship between Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet)
comes to a messy end, she decides to have it all deleted from her mind
at a clinic that specializes in that sort of thing. Upon finding out
that he&#x27;s essentially been erased, Joel opts to have the same procedure
done. As he&#x27;s lying comatose, trapped in his own disappearing memories
of the woman that, for a time, he loved, he starts to wonder if he has
made the right decision. Maybe some memories of Clementine are worth
holding on to.&#xA0;<br /><br />I like this movie. It&#x27;s smart, it&#x27;s thoughtful, it&#x27;s inventive, it&#x27;s
harsh, and it&#x27;s touching. The cinematography is beautiful, and all the
little transitions and visual flourishes that happen as Joel loses his
memories are pretty cool. Winslet is as great as always, Carrey pulls
off an excellent, understated (for him) performance, and a bevy of
solid supporting actors are present in the side-stories that compliment
the primary tale of Joel and Clementine.<br /><br />My personal favorite thing about the movie was seeing a relationship in
reverse, from ending to beginning. You see the cracks shrink and smooth
over, but the seeds were there from the very start. Is it worth it to
try again, armed with the both the knowledge of what to avoid, and the
knowledge that history may inevitably repeat itself? I don&#x27;t know. But,
I do know that this movie is well worth the hour and forty-eight
minutes it takes to watch it. Recommended.
