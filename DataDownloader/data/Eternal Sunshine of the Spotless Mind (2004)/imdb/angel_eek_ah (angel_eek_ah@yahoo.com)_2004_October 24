Seems everyone is jumping on the bandwagon for this movie. Oh my, it's
a Kaufman film! Let's all show our &quot;O-Face!&quot; Who are we kidding? I
mean, was &quot;Being John Malcovich&quot; really that good? No. I mean, who in
their right mind writes a movie about a movie actor? Are we celebrating
the amazing career of John?<br /><br />Anyhow, I'm not going to get into that movie. I'll talk about ESoTSM.
What a stupid acronym. Sort of like NKoTB. First off, the title itself
oozes &quot;I'm a pretentious French film maker&quot;. The sad thing being, I
actually thought I was going to get a good film out of the 5.99 I paid
to rent this movie. (Yes, I rented it.) <br /><br />Okay, anyone want to say I'm not intellectual enough to watch this
film? Bite me. I'm schooled, career oriented, and an avid movie buff.
This film was terrible. Haven't we all had enough of these &quot;artsy&quot; film
makers using the &quot;shaky camera&quot; until it gives us, the viewers, a
headache? I mean, I thought we had gotten enough of that when Woody
Allen started making films.<br /><br />Aside from the migraine inducing camera operation (which could have
been equaled by a five year old), the plot was utter crud. Okay, we
start with a fairly regular story of a man who suddenly decides to make
a difference in his life and meets an outlandishly pretentious &quot;weird&quot;
girl. Later in the film we learn that this memory is actually the
future, and these two have only met once at a beach barbecue. Que the
flaws. They only met that one time, huh? So they only met that one
time, Jim Carrey walked out, and suddenly they want to erase their
memories of each other. BUT WAIT! It seems they haven't only met once.
It seems that they have had their memories of each other erased before.
Jeez. Strike two, huh?<br /><br />Then, when all else seems to be going wrong, it only gets worse. The
film maker introduces a sub plot! Oh my. It seems heir docter actually
erased the memory of a young assistant he had an affair with. Okay,
does anyone else not really care about this? I sure didn't. In truth, I
saw it as an excuse to introduce a plot twist in order to save an
already bombing film.<br /><br />The commentary on my DVD was hilarious. Speaking of Elijah Wood and
Ruffalo as testosterone times ten? The two biggest fruits in the film
industry being spoken of as the manliest of men? Dancing around in
their underwear? Sorry, but on this one I'd have to take Vin Diesel
over these two goof balls.<br /><br />All in all, the film was a let down. A bunch of untied knots trying
very hard to meet somewhere in the middle of something which poorly
tries to come together as a story. It's basically trying to tell the
world that people who will NEVER get along can still fall in love, even
if they constantly want to forget they even knew one another. Is it a
glorification of the one night stand? I don't know.<br /><br />If you're bored, watch it. If you want an entertaining movie, rent
&quot;Bubba Ho-Tep&quot;. I can assure you it won't be as disappointing.
