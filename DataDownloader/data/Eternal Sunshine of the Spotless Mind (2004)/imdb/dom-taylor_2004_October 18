It has to be said, this is something different. Kate Winslet continues
her usual acting techniques, which it seems in every film she has made,
she has created a different character each time. (For example, from
quills to titanic). Winslet's character would certainly not be the same
character if director Michel Gondry had chosen a different actress<br /><br />But, what amazes me most is the role projected by Jim Carrey. Most
people will agree he has created a reputation of being a comedian;
whether you find him funny or not, this is the genre of the film he
usually works in....but here comes this movie, and my response is wow!<br /><br />It seems Winslet and carrey switch their usual roles, Winslet
Portraying an out going, slightly odd but cool character, and Carrey a
quiet, sensible person, who from time to time may become emotional.<br /><br />I was also interested in the choice of the theme of the film, its
highly unusual, and has never been done before. It's not another
installment of the Harry Potter or LOTR collection, or even based on a
novel; its a brand new idea, very entertaining with many twists and
turns in the plot which kept me extremely interested.<br /><br />Excellent job!<br /><br />7.5/10
