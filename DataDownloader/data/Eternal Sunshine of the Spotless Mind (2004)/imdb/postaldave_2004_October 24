This movie made me realize how great things are in my relationship<br /><br />I saw this movie as two things... a question of &quot;would you erase
memories of people ...relationships.... just to get rid of the pain? or
is the pain worth it?&quot;<br /><br />also.... it was a wonderful story of how love seems to exist no matter
what you do.... some things are just meant to be<br /><br />...and I just watched it again ... someone I just showed it to told me
this.... &quot;how nice.... even though they know what could, might
happen... it is still worth it to them&quot;<br /><br />Enjoy Postal
