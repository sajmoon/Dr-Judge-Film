This is such a brilliant and beautiful film. Michel Gondry takes
Charlie Kaufman&#39;s excellent script (I&#39;ve read it) to the next level &#150;
using a unique visual and stylistic approach to carry out the story.
The performances are spot-on, and the chemistry between Kate Winslet
and Jim Carrey (who plays a very different role than he usually does)
crackles. At its heart, Eternal Sunshine is a very insightful love
story that pulls at the heartstrings; there is a certain lyricism and
sensitivity to the story that is hard to find in movies these days &#150;
and it is that sensitivity that makes the film so alluring. When most
other love stories are a matter of life and death, this one is a matter
of memory, which relates to the question the film asks: how far will we
go to forget the relationships that, upon coming to an end, have hurt
us the most? It also happens to be very funny.
