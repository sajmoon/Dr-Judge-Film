Joel Barish(Jim Carrey) is informed that his ex-girlfriend
Clementine(Kate Winslet) who he was romantically involved with has had
her parts of her memories erased, the memory of there relationship. The
procedure was done by Dr. Mierzwiak(Tom Wilkinson) and the people that
work for him. Mainly to get even he decides to get the same procedure
done to himself. While the people that work for Dr. Mierzwiak go to
work on Joel Barish, Joel changes his mind but the procedure is still
going with his body paralyzed, but he struggles in his mind to save the
memories of Clementine from being deleted. And that is basically the
premise of the film, and when I first read the synopsis I thought it
would be a dumb film but decided to give it a try anyways and too my
surprise I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is a bizarre but intriguing film
and it&#x27;s wonderful in some areas as well, it also strives to be
original as well. A lot of aspect of this film is absurd especially the
whole procedure although it is some what fascinating but just
ridiculous, but it&#x27;s entirely forgivable since entire erasing of Joel&#x27;s
memories serves as just a backdrop to the whole film. Watching this
film was like watching a bizarre dream come to life, with it dealing
with love, romance and memories. The time period change can get a bit
confusing though since Gondry&#x27;s visual &#x27;clues&#x27; are subtle and the
character Jim Carrey played wasn&#x27;t lovable and don&#x27;t care as much if he
able to overcome his angst, which is some of the gripe I have with the
movie. It would have been nice if they pushed the character creativity
a bit further. I also found it to be a bit self indulgent which is
okay, but also seem to drag the film at times. The film isn&#x27;t complex
or deep as some people claim it to be, it&#x27;s a straight forward story
but a good one.<br /><br />7.9/10
