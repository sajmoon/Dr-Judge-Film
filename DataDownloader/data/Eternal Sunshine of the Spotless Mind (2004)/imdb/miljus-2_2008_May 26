Yes that&#39;s the perfect line for this confusing and unsatisfactory movie
that surely doesn&#39;t hold a candle to another Jim Carrey movie that was
released in 1998 The Truman Show which was far better than this
****.First of all Jim Carrey seemed miscast and even the beautiful Kate
Winslet doesn&#39;t seem that convincing too,but the worst point of the
movie comes when Jim Carrey goes to erase Kate from his mind because
all we see is a series of confusing and ultimately boring sequences
that makes the movie running time seems like eternity even if it have
108 minutes.I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s rated 8.5, it&#39;s one of the most
overrated movies of all time ,it&#39;s a FAILURE and DISGUSTING movie.
