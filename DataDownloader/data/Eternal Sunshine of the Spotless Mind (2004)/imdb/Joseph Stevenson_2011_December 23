This is one of those movies that are genuine pieces of art; a very rare
thing. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a truly beautiful film.
It&#x27;s cute, quirky and very deep. Joel Barish (portrayed beautifully by
Carrey) is an &#x22;every guy&#x22;. At least, that is how I feel. The movie&#x27;s
title is based on a beloved quote by Alexander Pope, which is very
fitting given the context of the film: How happy is the blameless
vestal&#x27;s lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal
sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray&#x27;r accepted, and each wish
resign&#x27;d; Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are an adorable team with great
support from Elijah Wood, Tom Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst, David Cross,
and others. The time-line of the film is very clever, but not too
confusing. I feel obligated to mention the sound track as it is a
fantastic atmosphere setter! I won&#x27;t go into the plot as you&#x27;ve most
probably read it on the title page. I really recommend this film, it&#x27;s
a milestone!
