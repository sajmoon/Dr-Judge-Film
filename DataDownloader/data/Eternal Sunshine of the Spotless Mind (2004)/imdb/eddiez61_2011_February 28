What&#x27;s the best part of this astonishingly mesmerizing film? I&#x27;d say
it&#x27;s the thorough mastery of the cinematic form. It&#x27;s every element is
blended into a towering achievement of modern movie making, whose
seamless integration of story, technique, effects, and performances is
truly genius. Charlie Kaufman was already one of my all time favorite
screen writers, his Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, and Human Nature
had already so completely entertained me. But Michael Gondry&#x27;s
direction of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (ESOTSM) has set a
new lofty standard for all future celluloid captured creativity.<br /><br />Depicting that elusive, mercury slick quality of our thoughts, dreams
and memories has long been a major challenge for all film makers. Many
have relied somewhat successfully on a deft control of pace, where
subtle shifts in timing and rhythm are all that&#x27;s needed to prompt us
to an altered reality. Gondry does this as perfectly as anyone else.
Others have been much more blatant and broad, employing such
conventions as blurred, hazy images recorded through Vaseline smeared
lenses, or even depositing their characters into suddenly severely
disproportionate sets, absurdly large or tiny props introduced as a
short hand gimmick. Gondry avails himself of these conventional
techniques, but only to masterfully exploit them for their comedic
impact. And too many other less capable hacks have not even bothered to
differentiate the two states, merely having the dreamer wake suddenly,
violently, to reveal that the previous experience was all just mental
chimera. A cheap, lousy stunt. Yes, Gondry even stoops to this cornball
level, and does it so very fluidly, seemingly as a gesture of genuine
respect to all the cinematic tactics that have so powerfully informed
and shaped our own self illusions and delusions. But Michael Gondry has
also fully grasped the value of computer aided graphics in merging both
the exterior and interior worlds. The dreamed, imagined, remembered
locales and environs are all as &#x22;real&#x22; as any anything else in this
film till they suddenly begin to fray, crack and crumble. Rooms and
houses are seen to disassemble themselves methodically, randomly, or
explosively with utterly natural grace. Like a drunken, drugged
fantasy, the whole of the universe unzips and inverts; gravity now
repulses and cause precedes effect. It&#x27;s so deeply disorienting. These
meticulously rendered, dizzying episodes are precisely the experience
that&#x27;s needed to convey the frantic, paranoid terror of losing one&#x27;s
memories. It feels as though all computer graphic effects were
developed exclusively, expressly for this one exact movie.<br /><br />The script is brilliantly self deprecating, as if continually surprised
to find itself actually passing for science fiction. It&#x27;s an admirable
conceit that Charlie has everyone so ambivalent about the fantastical
mind erasing procedure till well after things are under way. There&#x27;s
nothing more dizzying than to have everyone not realize just how dizzy
you are. It&#x27;s these subtle, unique expressions of wondrous doubt and
confusion that really demand so much of the cast. Jim Carey&#x27;s subdued,
focused performance is often exhilarating, and always exactly on key.
His moments as a tiny, not-so tiny, tot version of himself are
sublimely hilarious. Kate Winslet, as clever as she is gorgeous, hits
so many amazing notes with absolutely pitch perfect skill. And the
support crew are all entirely wonderful, with Tom Wilkinson
effortlessly animating the beleaguered but arrogant doctor, and Mark
Ruffalo so comfortable as a slacker nerd with hip habits. Kirsten Dunst
is adorable as his playmate coworker, and Elijah Wood makes post-teen
angst feel as sharp and dirty as a rusty nail.<br /><br />This delicate balance of hilarity and poignancy sounds like a fine
recipe for old time movie romance, and ESOTSM would have been only that
if everything wasn&#x27;t so expertly orchestrated towards a more
sophisticated purpose. Yes, it&#x27;s true we are cheering for the reunion
of our tragically separated hero and heroine, that&#x27;s the obvious bit.
But what elevates and distinguishes this tale is it&#x27;s insistence on
making valid claims to virtue and nobility, much more so than any
simple love story ever could. Kaufman and Gondry certainly recognize
the value and power that shared affection plays in our daily existence,
but they have tied this emotion to an even larger, deeper experience.
They have hitched it to our sense of consciousness. What truly
interests Charlie is our ability - our necessity - to consider and
reflect on just who we are, on who we want to be, and on how we strive
be that person. He is hoping to introduce us again to our own sense of
destiny. He is a master technician at constructing elaborate devices to
capture our imaginations and direct them towards more obscure, rare
regions of the psyche. This treacherously seductive machine, this
supremely elegant film has carried me to a genuinely higher place. I
actually feel enlightened and enlarged and more human for having seen
it.
