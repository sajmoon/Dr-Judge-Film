This movie is just another example of &quot;artsy&quot;, confused with clever.
Most people go to the movies for one reason, and one reason only, to be
entertained. I can think of not one scene in this confusing mish=mash
of a film that was entertaining. Instead of entertaining, in fact it
was a strain to watch. Granted, it is well made, but that doesn't make
up for the fact that the filmmaker should give the audience someone to
care about in their story. While Carrey and Winslet are good in their
roles, we just don't care what happens to them. I had a very similar
reaction to the last Kaufman film that I endured(barely), &quot;Being John
Malkovich&quot; I'm almost to the point of doing the opposite of what the
critics recommend, in light of the fact that this garbage was almost
universally acclaimed. What is amazing is that this film scores so
highly by the IMDb members. I haven't spoken to anyone who remotely
enjoyed &quot;spotless&quot;
