It&#39;s rather safe to say, than Jim Carrey has finally rose from the
ranks of Ace Ventura (if someone still doubted him after Man On The
Moon) as a &quot;real&quot; actor.<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Minds deals with the relationship of
Joel (Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet). They both go through a
treatment, that erases all their memories they have about each other.
But in the verge of being treated Joel realises, that he doesn&#39;t want
to lose his mementos: he wants to remember, so he struggles and tries
to hide his love from the procedure.<br /><br />Almost whole movie is shown as the procedure, Joel rummages through his
memories, sees flashes of things that have happened, tries to save
them. On the outside we see the doctors, who are working on him.<br /><br />Whole point of the film is, that even thought we want to erase certain
things from our mind would that really be something what we want to do?
Would that take something out from us? Would we turn into someone else
if our memories were taken? Maybe it&#39;s just good for us to remember.
Everything.<br /><br />This move certainly isn&#39;t for everyone. It contains no action, juts
fine acting and a very intriguing plot line. So, if action is something
you want steer clear from this one, if you want something to think
about, well this is for you then.
