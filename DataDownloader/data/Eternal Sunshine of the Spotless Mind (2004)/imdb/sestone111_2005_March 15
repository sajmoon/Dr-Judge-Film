In the proud tradition of other cinematic wonders like Barton Fink,The
Big Lebowski, and Vanilla Sky this movie really hit rock bottom. Once
again a Stellar Cast;Jim Carrey,Kate Winslet, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah
Wood, among others in a movie that sank right after the scene where Jim
Carrey drops off Kate Winslet to pick up some items from her apartment.
My girlfriend rented this movie and it looked good but it reminded me
of the fact that I am very proud that I don't go to the movies anymore
because once again I would have asked for a refund on this one. My
advice to the moviegoer is to borrow a copy from a friend who might
have bought it because it's not even worth renting.
