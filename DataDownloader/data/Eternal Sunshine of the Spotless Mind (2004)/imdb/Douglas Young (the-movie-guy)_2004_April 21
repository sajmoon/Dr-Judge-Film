Eternal Sunshine is a movie worth forgetting.  I looked at my watch 10
times, wanting the movie to end.  I stayed to the bitter end, but there were
40 lucky people who left the movie early.  Jim Carrey plays a man who
discovers that his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has had her memories
of their relationship erased from her mind.  He goes to the doctor to have
the same procedure of erasing her memories from his mind.  We get to see
each memory of their relationship as they are erased from his mind.  The
only good thing I got out of the movie is that it makes you think about how
important our memories are to us.  However, I wouldn't mind erasing this
movie from my memory.  (Focus Features, Run Time 1:48, Rated R)
