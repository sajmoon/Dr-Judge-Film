I admit that I'm a great fan of romantic comedies and I like most of
them quite much, but this story simply moved me. Throughout the movie
I've been gripped by it, anxious to see how it would end. If you like a
bit twisted stories with lots of love, and if you're bored with
romantic movies that follow the same pattern you should try this out.
However, some women didn't like to movie as it was too twisted, too
much original, so perhaps it isn't the best movie for a romantic date.
Personally, I find the acting magnificent that is very real. Jim Carrey
really did a great job there. To sum up, the story line is compelling
and original, the acting great, and the movie curiously warm.
