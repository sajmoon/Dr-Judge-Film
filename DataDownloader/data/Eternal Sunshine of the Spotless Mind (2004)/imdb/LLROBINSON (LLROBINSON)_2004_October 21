What if you could erase someone from your awareness? All your memories
of them would be gone...or would it be just the image of the person
missing from the memories, with the space and time and various props
still in your recollection? That is one huge what-if, and making a
movie around that elusive concept is quite a feat. While there were
moments I felt uncomfortable and even bored (once I actually figured
out what was going on, that is), I still give the writer and director
major credit for presenting us with this concept. <br /><br />Here's another thought: If you could completely forget a person you had
dated for two years, then you met them on the street, would you be
drawn to them for all the same reasons you had been in the first
relationship? How many times could two people meet each other for the
first time, and find themselves attracted? Infinitely? Or, as the movie
hints, perhaps there is a small part of you that never forgets, or
something about a person and a relationship that cannot be erased. Call
it a theme, an essence, an aroma. <br /><br />Finally, I think one moral of this story is &quot;'tis better to have loved,
and lost, than never to have loved at all.&quot; At the end of the movie,
Joel is vigorously willing to go through any and all pain and heartache
that may result eventually, if it means he can enjoy the sweetness of
being with Clementine for now, in all her exciting, seriously *&amp;%@ed-up
splendor.
