Charlie Kaufman is probably the most unbearable screenwriter whose
movies I&#39;ve ever had the misfortune of seeing: the masturbation scenes
in &quot;Adaptation&quot; sum up his artistic contributions perfectly. &quot;Eternal
Sunshine&quot; is just more masturbation. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet have
no chemistry, and most of the characters&#39; performances are flat and
unconvincing, as if they can&#39;t believe they&#39;re acting this crap out
either. Not to mention the nonsensical, confusing plot, and how
aesthetically unpleasant most of the film is. I couldn&#39;t recommend this
movie less; without a doubt, one of the worst I have ever seen. If only
they could purge my memory of having seen it.
