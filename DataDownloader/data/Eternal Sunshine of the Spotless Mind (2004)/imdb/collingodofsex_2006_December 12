Jim Carey has proved himself to be one of the great actors of our
decade in this film. He is just phenomenal, the way he captures the
humor in this movie, i do not think that anyone else could have pulled
it off better. Kate Winslet is amazing, she and Jim Carey are just so
entirely different in this movie, that they seem perfect. The most
original love story i have ever seen, not like the predictable, love
stories, with traditional plots, this is creativity at its best. The
imagery, the acting, the directing, everything in this movie is great.
The only problem with it is that you have to wait t&#39;ill you get almost
in the middle of the movie, because it is kind of complicated, but once
you start feeling it, you will agree with me that this is an excellent
movie. Jim Carey does not get the consideration he deserves, he is an
amazing actor, watch this movie and i&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree.
