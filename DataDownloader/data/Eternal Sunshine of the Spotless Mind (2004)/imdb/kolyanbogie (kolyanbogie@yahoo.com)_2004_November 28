I don't have anything to add to the praise for this film, that other
users haven't said already. This is an excellent movie, very original
and well-done. However, would the doctor of Lacuna employ two
irresponsible kids to carry out his bizarre procedure? Drinking beer,
smoking pot, and having sex while a man's brain is tampered with? It's
just absurd. I suppose one must &quot;suspend disbelief.&quot; Another thing:
what was up with Joel not shaving? I understand being lazy about
shaving, but would Clementine be attracted to this taciturn guy who
doesn't shave or comb his hair, and always wears that dopey cap? I
doubt it.
