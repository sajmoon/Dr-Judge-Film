2005_May 23 
I've just finished watching a wonderful piece of work. I'm not going to
say a piece of art, because I could be wrong. I was talking with my
father, who said about the move: &quot;It's not a piece of art&quot;, but
couldn't even say what a piece of art was for him.<br /><br />It was without question one of last year's best films, and the cult
audience loved it; but I'm not willing to expand on that. But I'm
willing to say how disappointed I am because Hollywood keeps
underestimating the very best they have in their hands. Just because
Jim Carrey stars in the film, as he starred in one of my favorite
movies, the underrated &quot;The Truman Show&quot;; or underrated movies like
another of my favorites, &quot;Almost Famous&quot;&#133;There's a long list of
underrated films; Michel Gondry's feature is definitely in that list.<br /><br />When you think of it, &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; is not
just wholeness as a movie, but for all the persons involved in the
project. From the top; if you think about Michel Gondry's work as a
video director, and his early full-length projects, this is the best he
has achieved; he's starting from now on. He did a correct work in
&quot;Human Nature&quot;, but I didn't think his direction was at Kaufman's
script level. But now it's a different thing. It's the correct
commitment with team working one of the reasons that make this movie
great. And Kaufman, well&#133;I know we've been disappointed because he
hasn't been recognized, but the way I see it, this is not a merciful
Oscar&#133;This is the best he has written (although I admit I haven't seen
&quot;Being John Malkovich)! I know Kate Winslet (Clementine) is one of the
best actresses working today. She never disappoints and always adds
personality to her roles, but has never been recognized for that.
However, surpassing her remembered Rose (&quot;Titanic&quot;), she confronts a
much complex role; deeper and flexible. And she does it as perfectly as
she has always done it, and even better than her &quot;forgotten by me as I
watched her performance in this movie&quot; Rose. Jim Carrey (Joel) is one
of my favorite actors, and he has built a spectacular career. As it
happened to me with Adam Sandler and his performance in &quot;Spanglish&quot;
(although it's not exactly the same situation); it has happened with
Jim Carrey playing dramatic roles. I'm in love with both of his sides
as an actor; comedy and drama. &quot;Liar, Liar&quot; is my favorite comedy, and
I think Jim Carrey is great in it. But then, he can make you cry; he's
that great actor, and while he won't be recognized for it, leaving
behind &quot;Man on the moon&quot;, &quot;The Majestic&quot; and even &quot;The Truman Show&quot;;
Carrey has arrived at his best dramatic performance. I don't want to
reiterate too much in these circumstances, but it's another voice,
another innocent and warm look; magic in his movements: &quot;I could die
here, Clem; I'm exactly where I wanna be&quot;. This and many other phrases
written in another thought-provoking, messing with human mind and
conscience, wise realistic screenplay from Charlie Kaufman.<br /><br />With Tom Wilkinson (Howard) in his wonder years, Kirsten Dunst (Mary)
shining as I hadn't seen her since &quot;Crazy/Beautiful&quot;, Elijah Wood
(Patrick) in his career's most calmed and natural performance, and
another amazing interpretation in his own territory of independent
cinema by the grand Mark Ruffalo (Stan); wholeness in a movie. Positive
aspects for everybody.<br /><br />Michel Gondry's camera takes us to a fantasy world where he makes
things appear and disappear, move and stay still&#133;Beautiful music
composed perfectly for each moment by Jon Brion (these are his types of
movies)&#133;Eye-shocking cinematography by Ellen Kuras in every frame&#133;And
so they make us watch and cry, laugh, feel for the characters; we want
the best for them when they keep on meeting in the present, in the
past, in the future; and we let ourselves go to those unreachable
places you will only reach if you're flying in the world of words&#133;Words
written with wisdom with the power that relies on the actors, because
they must bring these beautiful words to life. &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the
Spotless Mind&quot; is one of those movies you can't regret watching even
when you like them or not. One of those that keep you talking an hour
after experiencing them&#133; Now it's the second time I've watched the
movie&#133;I don't give second viewings to movies&#133;I have watched my favorite
movie only once.
