My girlfriend brought over Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind about
a week ago and I was amazed by it. It has everything that you could
ever want out of a movie. Good plot, good acting, good music, etc...
The idea of the film is that this guy wants to erase the memories that
he has of his girlfriend. The way the movie was filmed is confusing but
that isn't a bad thing at all. The director takes you through the
memories in such a manner that baffles you. The way the main
character's memories start to melt into one another and how he has a
conversation with himself is so original. And for all of those people
that say Jim Carrey can't act, this movie will prove you wrong and then
some. This movie is one of my newly found favorite movies of all time.
It is a must see.
