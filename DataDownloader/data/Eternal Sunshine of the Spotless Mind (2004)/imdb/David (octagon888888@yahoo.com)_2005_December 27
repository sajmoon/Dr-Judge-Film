I will admit, when it first came out last year it did not appeal a
whole lot to me, but after all this talk of how great it is, I am
letting everyone know that I regret not seeing this one in the
theaters!<br /><br />It was a beautiful film, very different, very realistic, very crazy,
and trippy, however, although it is strange, it is one of those movies
that you can understand what's going on without it throwing you off to
badly, leaving you saying &quot;WTF?!?!&quot; No, this is a fantastic movie with
excellent character structure which I recommend to anyone, anyone who
loves movies. However tis is not for the low intelligent people out
there who wish to only see blood and explosions, while those kinds of
things are entertaining, they aren't much without a story, and this was
a movie with a lot of wonderful story, and it wasn't quite 2 hours!<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is living Proof that the best
stories are not found in big over priced Hollywood popcorn movies, but
with people who put time, effort, and love into writing a script, and
producing a movie that will both entertain, shock, and leave the viewer
speechless with how thought provoking and moving the film truly is.
Eternal Sunshine is definitely one of the top 5 movies of 2004 if not
THE BEST one. Great Job Jim, Kate, Kaufman and Gondry!
