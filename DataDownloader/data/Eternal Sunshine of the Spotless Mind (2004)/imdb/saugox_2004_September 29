If you have an ex wishing to forget all about you, haver him/her watch
this movie. This movie ought to make people people think twice before
wishing to forget about their ex-lovers.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film, from beginning to the end. If you'r clever
you'll figure out the twist quite soon, but it's still a good twist,
and the way it's told is very good. The way the movie was shot, the
language of it all, was very... alive, creative and refreshing. Not
Hollywood plastic. I liked the ending and the film in it's whole. The
parts where Carry's character is trapped in his own memories, fighting
to keep them, has a very nice tone to them. The effects blend very well
into it all. The character Clementine is also very charming. There's no
fake characters, although Elijah's characters shallow, and after the
LOTR it's kinda though to see him in this part. I will definitely watch
this film again, and I'd recommend anyone to see it. I could wish for
more bonus material on the DVD, but it has the standard selection of
commentary, documentary and delted scenes plus some more. Watch it and
enjoy it. 8.5/10
