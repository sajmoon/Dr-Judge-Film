Do you want to erase someone from your memory? Dr. Howard Mierzwaik can
do it for you. Even Clementine (Kate Winslet) did it, so did Joel (Jim
Carrey). What are you waiting for? <br /><br />Top of my mind: the idea of this film is remarkable. Almost half way
through the film, the boundaries between consciousness and
subconsciousness is faded. That's the good news that emerge from the
same screenwriter of &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; - Charlie Kaufman. <br /><br />I don't know much about cinematography, but I like the camera angle and
the mood that constructed by the color grading of this movie. And yes,
Jim Carrey performance is brilliant, far better than his acting in his
previous drama, Truman Show! Salute!<br /><br />Well, I have to admit that this is a bizarre film, but I like it so
much.
