oooh away from being a fan of Jim Carey and kate winslet i think that
movie is one of the most romantic and thriller movies it has some sort
of mystery during it&#x27;s actions<br /><br />very very very nice film<br /><br />also it talks about some thing you may feel it real me as a doctor can
say that the medical aspect of the deleting some thing from the memory
as it is shown in the movie has some sort of reality may not be now but
who may know , it could be possible in the future<br /><br />finally<br /><br />after i watch that movie i love JIM CARREY more and more
