This is movie is good and fun to watch .. but, I believe it is too
overrated .. so far it is on the top 50 at the IMDb list which is too
overrated to that movie .. besides, it is too complicated .. I like all
of Charlie Kaufman&#39;s movies but this one was too complicated to
understand as you reach the end .. you have to re-watch it several
times or ask someone to simplify for you .. I&#39;d never understood it if
my dear friend Abdurrahman Sleepers didn&#39;t explain it for me. What I
like about it is the lovely romantic moments and how will love really
makes you do miracles for the ones you love. I think this movie is my
least favorite of Kaufman&#39;s movies. Jim carry&#39;s performance was an OK
and not great .. so is Kate.
