I wish I could write and write whatever comes in my mind about this
magnificent piece of art called film-making. But all those would
ultimately come to one bottomline: I don't give the credit to the
director, as it is Kaufman's masterpiece screen writing that brings
such magic to this film to make it one of the best examples of modern
fimmaking.<br /><br />The idea of revisiting the memories is so overused and equally
ill-treated in films that I'm sure every other screenwriter would mess
it up in the end. But Kaufman pulled it off flawlessly. In a non-linear
film such as this, I'm also surprised by the directing style. And it
also helped to have such a fantastic cast. Carrey, playing a normal
commonplace guy this time without any of his trademark characteristics
and antics, reminds us that he is primarily a genius actor regardless
of the type of film. Winslet, having a magnificent consistency of skill
in each film is always a treat to watch. Her portrayal of Clementine is
perhaps one of her bests... along with Finding Neverland and Jude. And
there are also good supporting roles played by Wilkinson and the
ever-interesting Mark Ruffalo.<br /><br />The film does carry an interesting message about love and relationship
and sacrifice and adjustment. Those who can relate to them will
definitely like the film more and more. When I saw the film a year ago,
I didn't have any such experience which could make me take the film
more personally. But I do have one now, which I can somehow relate to
the film's message. That made me discover its wonders again.
