&quot;Meet me in Montauk&quot; she whispered. At the least I found hope at the
end of this wonderful voyage through some of our most closely guarded
emotions, so secretive even we do not know their depth or power. My
modest effort at a review pales in comparison to a previously
well-written piece - I will only say I&#39;ve now watched this movie
upwards of ten times, and the tug on my heart and admiration for the
directing excellence and cast just keeps getting stronger. Jim Carrey
continues to amaze me, reprising- and surpassing -his unexpectedly
sensitive and brilliant performance in The Truman Show. I felt
compelled to offer my humble opinion of this fine production. I can&#39;t
help but wonder if Mr. Carrey had a hand in writing the script, or
screenplay. The role suits him perfectly. Lest I forget to mention
Kate, I can only wish I could meet a woman with her emotional fires,
sincerity, and the unique passion she brings to her role as Clem. Where
are you, Clementine?
