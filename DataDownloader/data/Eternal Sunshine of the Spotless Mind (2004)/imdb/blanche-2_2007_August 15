It&#39;s hard not to fall in love with a film that begins with a voice-over
saying (paraphrasing): &quot;Valentine&#39;s Day was created by card companies
to make everybody feel like crap.&quot; Right afterward, I watched Jim
Carrey force himself through a half-closed train door, and I said, this
is for me.<br /><br />Carrey, in a complete turnabout, plays Joel, a lonely man who falls in
love with a lively, quirky nut named Clementine. The romance
progresses, fights ensue, and one day, Joel walks into the bookstore
where Clementine works, and she&#39;s making out with someone else and
doesn&#39;t seem to even recognize him. Then their friends receive a note
saying that Clementine has erased Joel from her memory, and they
shouldn&#39;t mention him again. Joel heads to the clinic himself to find
out what&#39;s going on. There he finds programmers who can draw a map of
your memories about an individual on the brain and get rid of them.
Joel decides to have the procedure. Part of the way through it, he
tries desperately to stop it, to find some way to remember Clementine,
bringing her into places and memories where she never was. The
programmers (Elijah Wood, Thomas Ryan) don&#39;t notice anything odd about
the procedure because they&#39;re busy drinking, dancing in their underwear
and doing drugs with Mary (Kirsten Dunst) a secretary at the clinic.
When they finally notice a problem, the head man (Howard Wilkinson) is
called in. Slowly Clementine disappears from Joel&#39;s brain as he
desperately tries to hold onto her.<br /><br />A spectacular story with a few twists along the way, and spectacular
acting, particularly from Carrey, Winslet and Dunst, make this a real
winner. Carrey is a sympathetic, warm character, Winslet is adorable
and charming, and Dunst is a complete natural, be she stoned in her
underwear, trying to talk sense under the influence, or crying. They
are wonderful as is the rest of the cast.<br /><br />&quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; is about the death of memory
but not of emotion and the cry of the heart that goes on - sometimes
without knowing why. A beautiful, beautiful film.
