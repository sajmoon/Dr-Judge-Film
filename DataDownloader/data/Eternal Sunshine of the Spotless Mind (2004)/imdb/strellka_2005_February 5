The movie is well done and unusual. Let me start off by saying I am not
a big fan of the Hollywood type romantic films- you know the ones
written according to the old formula ( he meets her, she does not like
him they fall in love and marry) Even though this is not one of those
People still call it a chick flick, This is a very superfluous view of
the movie- even though the plot is based around a couples emotional
turmoils and exploration of their feelings for each other, and that can
be seen as banal. But hey taking the view that everything there is to
write has already been written and everything there is to say has
already been said, similarly almost everything there is to be put on
screen - you get the picture. The fascinating thing about this movie is
how it makes us forget the banal and concentrate on the process of the
story- even though the plot can be hard to follow, because it is so
well done you do not get lost, there is a very distinct thread of
coherence pulling it all together. Anyway, I watched it with my
husband, who is very hard to please, and he seemed to have like it as
well his words were &quot;hmm not bad,&quot; even so, I enjoyed it thoroughly and
highly recommend it.
