this movie really makes you think, it is reasonably well done and has
points that.. well, you have to experience.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.<br /><br />do not be sidetracked about the reputation of these actors. it isn't
slapstick, it is not mostly stupid comedy.<br /><br />it isn't something you will enjoy, if you are not the kind of person
who likes suspense and thinking in new directions.<br /><br />I can't describe this movie without spoiling it so, i'm not going to.<br /><br />I am grateful my friends shared this movie with me. especially good to
watch when you are having a suck day, but don't feel like watching
comedy.<br /><br />I rate this movie 3 tissues and a pillow. some crying and a Lot of
emotional frustration.
