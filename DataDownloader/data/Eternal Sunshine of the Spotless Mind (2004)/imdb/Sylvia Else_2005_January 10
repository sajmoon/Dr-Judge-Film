This was billed as a comedy, and I expected it to be rather funnier
than it was. It had its moments, but humour was not its focus. The plot
line is simple enough - you have memories you don't like, so you get
them erased. I couldn't help wondering how practical that would be. The
film seemed largely to assume that you could remain blissfully unaware
afterward that you had some missing memories, yet even events in the
film made it clear that this could never happen.<br /><br />The team that performs the procedure are rather unprofessional. I
suppose that was meant to be funny, and to a limited extent formed part
of the plot. I just found it appalling.<br /><br />In the end, I found the film disturbing. If you can get memories
erased, and not know that you've done it, then even if you've never had
it done, you wouldn't know that for sure. Memories are part of what
makes you you. The process described in the film seemed a bit like
committing suicide in increments.<br /><br />But I'm glad I saw it.<br /><br />Sylvia.
