I must say, I was reluctant to view this film. I have been a big fan of
Kate Winslet's work, but Jim Carrey...not so much. All right, I hate
his movies, but not anymore. To me he's a revelation in this movie.
Sensitive, complex, emotive and a true match to Kate Winslet's
considerable talent. This film is basically a romance, but with an
intellectual twist so rare in this era of throw-away relationships.
This film dares to suppose that some relationships aren't and shouldn't
be so easily discarded. The idea is wonderful, the script intelligent
and romantic (with a nice little subplot involving the technicians) and
the execution picture perfect. I urge anyone out there like me who has
been purposely avoiding Jim Carrey's work to try this one. It's so
good, you can almost forget Ace Ventura...almost.
