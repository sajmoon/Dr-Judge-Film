2008_November 7 
My embarrassing confession is that lately I&#39;ve been having trouble
following movies. I was worried for a while that maybe I was becoming
dumber, like I couldn&#39;t understand great films any more. But maybe it
was because I stopped following certain movies because they actually
weren&#39;t that great, and hence they lost my interest. I say that because
two movies I&#39;ve watched lately, Hitchcock&#39;s Vertigo (1958) and now
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), both of which are complex
movies, actually did manage to hold my attention and I loved both of
them.<br /><br />So what&#39;s good here? Although the movie is categorized at the local
video store as a comedy, I was looking for something heavier- a serious
drama- and this hit the spot. There&#39;s little funny here; at most it&#39;s a
drama with some comic relief. The writing is smooth and that&#39;s no
surprise because it&#39;s from Charlie Kaufman, the man behind Adaptation
(2002), who with that film and this one, is establishing himself as one
of Hollywood&#39;s best writers. The acting is good. The storyline is
interesting- it&#39;s about a couple named Joel and Clementine (played by
Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet) growing unhappy with each other, so they
go to a special clinic where they can have their memory of each other
erased. But during the procedure, Joel soon regrets his decision to
erase Clementine and desperately tries to hide her deep in his
memories. The way this unfolds is very dream-like, with surreal
sequences as things in the memories begin to disappear and blur. This
took some imagination and you have to admire it. The movie won an Oscar
for writing and probably deserves more recognition. It&#39;s a latter day
classic.
