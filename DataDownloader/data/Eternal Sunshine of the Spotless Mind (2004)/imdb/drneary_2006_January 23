Eternal Sunshine is an example of a brilliant idea for a short film
drawn out into a full length feature it cannot handle. The premise of a
man erasing his memories of a failed romance only to realise within his
memory the love he still feels is certainly an original and inspired
one, but it deserved better treatment.<br /><br />Fantastically conceived visually, with characters' faces disappearing
and objects simply erasing themselves, the film suffers from Carrey
being simply too whiny and unlikable a lead in this (compared to his
considerably more lovable and justifiably upset Truman in the Truman
Show). His relationship with Winslet's Clementine is simply
unbelievable. I has been said that opposites attract but these two are
simply too opposite. There romance seems to boil down to little more
than an intense sexual attraction, and little more, although Carrey
gets across in his voice that he is in love, the script seems to argue
otherwise.<br /><br />The film is dragged about by some excruciatingly dull subplots starring
talented but misused actors (Wood, Dunst), which seem only in place to
make the ending come about as it does (Wood's role for example is
extremely unsettling and manipulative, but neither he nor the script
pull it off).<br /><br />The music is as times terrific and at others dull and confusing in its
use.<br /><br />But Carrey and the fantastic art direction manage to make this a very
entertaining film, that alas wears thin with repeated viewing.<br /><br />Certainly worth a peek for those interested in modern
pseudo-philosophical cinema.
