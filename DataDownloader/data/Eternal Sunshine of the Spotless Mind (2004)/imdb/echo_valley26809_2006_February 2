Just as you want to be sure that you're really in love, you also want
to make sure you're completely out of it.<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine is one of the best written stories of all time. The
plot is surreal, yet believable, while the characters interact in a
three-dimensional way.<br /><br />Simply put, this movie is about a man named Joel (Jim Carrey) who
undergoes a special treatment to get the memory of his ex-girlfriend
(Kate Winslet) erased after their rough break-up. He watches with
bitter resentment as the most recent memories are erased. But when he
sees that all the good memories are going too, Joel immediately regrets
his decision.<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a love story, but only on the
surface. The real story is that people want to get rid of all their bad
experiences, but we fail to realize that the bad make the good all the
more sweeter. And we need both to learn and grow, otherwise we are
doomed to repeat our mistakes.
