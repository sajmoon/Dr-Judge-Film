Hey, IMDb friends: I'm from Colombia, and 4 months ago i watched
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind. This was the most amazing movie
i've ever seen, it has comedy, sweetness, drama, good music (Beck's
song is wonderful) and love. I was impressed, and I watched it 3 times
in movies because it's the best movie in all the history. I hope it'll
win 6 or 8 Oscars, including best principal actor (Carrey), best
principal actress (Winslet), best director (Gondry), best original
script (Kaufman) and best special effects. I loved it cause it takes us
to an imaginary and wonderful world inside Kaufman's head. Did you see
'Being john Malkovich'? No? You have to see it. It's amazing too. I
just wanted to say that, I hope you say the same. Ivan. PD: sorry for
my so-so English
