Perhaps the most confusing love story ever to be told, and nonetheless
this film is sufficiently lucid and sensible to bond with the regular
audience. I remember someone addressing Eternal Sunshine of the
Spotless Mind as &#x27;&#x27;experimentalism and complexity for people who do not
like experimentalism and complexity&#x27;&#x27;, and it does sound correct, even
though the suggestive romantic topic and star-filled cast may hold the
huge portion of responsibility for the success.<br /><br />Once again it must be told, when featuring Kaufman at the writing
process, nothing ordinary can be expected. This time, however, his mind
seemed less inspired, at least when compared to everything else he has
created, maybe forced to hold back on the eccentricity in consideration
for the public&#x27;s mainstream designate audience. Whatever the reason, it
did not had a terrible affect on the movie, that is very good, although
not as shiny as other &#x27;&#x27;Kaufman-esque&#x27;&#x27; pieces.<br /><br />Diving on the story, it is easy to sympathize with the characters,
Carrey and Winslet allure is performed with perfection during both
atmospheric and tempestuous portions. Their star overshadowed the
annoying support of Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood, which despite having
a significant importance, arouse nothing but irritation.<br /><br />After all it can be said that Gondry&#x27;s enterprise was successful in all
its purposes. The melancholic romance with a hopeful disconsolate
outcome and psychological disturbances worked beautifully and it can be
counted as a rare mind-bending movie that can be appreciated without
bending the mind that much.
