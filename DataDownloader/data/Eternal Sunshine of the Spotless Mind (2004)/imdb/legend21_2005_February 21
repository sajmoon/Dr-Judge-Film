This movie has literally changed my ideas on relationships. This is
definitely one of the greatest movies of 04 and all time I might add!
The movie itself is confusing to a lot of first time watchers so you
have to have a deep concentration or you will not connect with the
movie on as nearly a personal basis as myself and many other people
have through watching it. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet both give amazing
performances, (Winslet is Oscar-nominated for this and Carrey SHOULD be
as well), you truly feel for them as they experience what all couples
shouldn't. The movie is extremely powerful and will not be erased from
any viewers mind. Bring your girlfriend or boyfriend to this one!!! It
will bring you two closer together!
