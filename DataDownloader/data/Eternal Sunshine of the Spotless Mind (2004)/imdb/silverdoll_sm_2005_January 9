This movie is captivating. Kudos to everyone involved, especially
Charlie Kaufman, Michael Gondry, Jim Carey and Kate Winslet. Carey and
Winslet break the mold and transform themselves into two characters
completely unlike anything they've played before. They both give the
best performances of their lives. The writing is amazing, full of
emotional depth, subtleties, humor and darkness. It takes you through
an emotional and visual train ride (or train wreck) of a dysfunctional
relationship bringing the audience to a deeper understanding of the
value of experiences, both good and bad, and a person's subconscious.
It is my absolute favorite, and gets better every time.
