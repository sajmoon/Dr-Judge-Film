Eternal Sunhine of the spotless mind is one of my favorite movies, It&#39;s
some of the few movies were actually everything was excellent. One of
the (If not THE) best direction work I&#39;ve ever seen, a lot of
symbolisms and well put scenes, the complexity of the work makes the
movie a little bit bizarre but that just makes you appreciate more the
quality of work we see. I was completely surprise by Jim Carey&#39;s
acting, I actually didn&#39;t knew he can act, but this movie states he can
not only act but excel in this field, maybe if he would have dedicated
to this kind of movies he would be in the same place as Johnny Depp or
even Eduard Norton. Kate Whinslet always great!! the secondary
characters (Elijah Wood, Kristen Dunst...) were also very good. The
photography is awesome. The Script was a really incredible piece of
writing, if I was too say the 2 best things of these movie, the script
and the direction will definitively be my decisions. this one is one of
the few Incredibly good movies that we can see now, A TRULY PIECE OF
ART. 10 out of 10!!!!!!!!!!
