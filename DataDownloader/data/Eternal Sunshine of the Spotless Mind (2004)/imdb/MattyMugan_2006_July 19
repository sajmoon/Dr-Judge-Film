Sunshine was one of those cinema films, credited as a story about love
i got dragged along by the girlfriend. At the time I enjoyed the sci-fi
aspect of it. I found the writing and idea to be interesting on a
purely inventive level. A very original concept which I found as more
of a good story at the time. I appreciated the acting, particularly the
way Carrey portrayed his character. People don&#39;t always give him the
respect that his abilities deserve, they see him as a funny man, but
their are films like this and The Truman Show where he manages to
capture an emotion which he might not be so related to.<br /><br />I watched the film again on DVD of late, and things that happened to me
related to the film, which cast it in a totally different light. I
could suddenly understand the idea of removing somebody from your mind,
the physical act of it didn&#39;t sound like a clever Sci-Fi idea, but
something that should be able to be done. In the same way, I also
understood the concept of running from the removal. It related to me
because I found that I didn&#39;t want to forget things, and wanted to
forget others.<br /><br />I think this film has several different effects on people. Those with
histories in relationships will feel a lot more connected with the
film, it speaks to people who still feel the effects of their own
relationships. To others, who cant feel this connection, it becomes
much more of a typical film, nothing really to relate to, no compelling
characters, no huge action or uncomplicated story lines. The viewer can
just see it, but not really care. This leaves them thinking less of
such a film.<br /><br />I think the only way people can really appreciate this film is to see
themselves in it, pick a person who they are like, and understand how
they would react in such a situation. I believe that this film is much
better when you see your own mind and memories, and begin to feel the
story.
