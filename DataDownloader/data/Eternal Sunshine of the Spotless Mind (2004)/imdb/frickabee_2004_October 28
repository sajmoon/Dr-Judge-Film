After seeing the user rating of this flick on IMDb and hearing from a
Blockbuster employee of how &quot;brilliant&quot; this movie is, I decided to
check it out. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed. Obviously,
only the true Charlie Kaufman devotees seem to like this film as
indicated by the rave reviews.<br /><br />The story was half-assed and the characters are shallow and
uninteresting, especially Joel. The chemistry between him and
Clementine is contrived from the very beginning. Throughout the entire
movie, we're treated to memory after memory them together while Joel
tries to hang on to each one. By the time the movie gets to the
sub-plot, who really cares? The characters in this film are only about
as naive as the entire cast of Mystic Pizza.<br /><br />I went back to reading reviews of this movie and none of them seem to
indicate why this movie is any good. I hear &quot;good cinematography,&quot;
maybe; &quot;artsy,&quot; sure; &quot;original,&quot; not for a Charlie Kaufman film; but I
would also add lackadaisical, pedantic and half-baked.
