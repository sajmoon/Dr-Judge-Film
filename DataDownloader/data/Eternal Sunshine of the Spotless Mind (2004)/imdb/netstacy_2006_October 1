The movie is fantastic, so the actors are. It is very refreshing to see
Jim Carey playing a part like this. When I met him for an interview a
few years ago, he told me that he would love to be not only the funny
guy. We all know this is difficult, because once you played some funny
characters, the people and the producer wants to see you staying in
that. This brilliant movie proves his all-round abilities. I am happy
for him.<br /><br />This is one of the very few movies that successfully brings action and
drama together with a good love story. It has also very well dosed
slightly funny and sarcastic peaks that prevents this movie from
getting too heavy. <br /><br />Every couple an therapist should watch this. :)
