This year has not turned out much in the way of amazing movies. Eternal
Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is the exception. Focus Features slogan
definitely fits: If we live in a diverse world, why are so many movies
the same?<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine is wonderfully written (Charlie Kaufman) directed
(Michel Gondry) and acted (Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey, with a solid
supporting cast like Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, and Tom
Wilkinson)<br /><br />The story revolves around Joel, who's shy, withdrawn, and of course
nice, and Clementine, who's impulsive, wild and somewhat vindictive.
These two polar opposites fall in love. The film begins at the end of
their rocky relationship. Clementine impulsively decides to erase Joel
from her memory, and he, in response to this news, gets the same
process done. However, as he journeys through his memories, Joel
realizes how much he still loves her, and changes his mind. He spends
the night going from memory to memory, trying desperately to save his
memories of Clem.<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine is a perfectly weaved story. Winslet and Carrey give
amazing performances, and in my opinion, both deserve and Oscar for it.
This film just proves that Jim Carrey is an excellent actor, not just a
comedian. It also proves that Kate WInslet IS the actress of her
generation. And this is THE movie of 2004. If you like movies, see
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
