2005_February 5 
I don't get it. Not the movie--I get that. I don't get the almost
universal disregard this film engendered upon its release and then the
widespread adulation it has gained after it was summarily drummed out
of the theaters. I know there's no accounting for taste, and mine is
probably as bad as anyone else's, but there is so much that is
wonderful in this movie--so much that stays with you after you leave
the theater--that it deserves a better fate than what it may become--a
cult classic.<br /><br />And yet, it's kind of fun, isn't it, to like something that the masses
thumbed their noses at? To be part of a little coterie that does
appreciate imaginative writing, inspired directing, amazing
cinematography, and remarkable acting? Of course I'm not denying the
possibility that our little coterie is way off base, but I don't care.
