I have seen this movie a number of times now and it really is an
amazing piece of work. I don't think I have ever been able to
personally relate to a movie on the level that I did with Eternal
Sunshine. Obviously people who have been through bad break-ups will get
more out of this movie than those who have not. I find it surprising
that the young crowd is rating this so high because of that fact. I
guess that is just more testimony to how great of a film this really
is.<br /><br />As for the people who think that this is going to drop in the ratings
after it hits DVD, I have to disagree. I think it will only solidify
its ranking as one of the best films in this genre ever produced. I
just got done reading the trivia section on this movie and read that
Nicholas Cage was originally going to be cast as Joel. What an
excellent decision to go with Jim Carrey. I have been a fan of his
since the Ace Ventura movies and he has really matured into one of
Hollywood's best leading men. His acting ability really runs the gamut
of all genres. I was also glad to see Kate Winslet in this role as I
think she is an under appreciated actress. All in all the casting
could'nt have been better. As for the script, well this is easily one
of the most original stories I have seen in all my years of watching
movies. I guarantee right now that this wins best screenplay at the
Oscars and Jim carrey will without a doubt get a nod for best actor.
While Kate Winslets performance was great, I don't think she will get a
nomination for best actress. So there you have it - Best screenplay &amp;
Best Actor for Eternal Sunshine!!!<br /><br />Last but not least, why is there so much debate going on about the top
250 in here. Its not like people are signing up with 400 different
email accounts to raise this movie up in the standings. this is a
legitimate poll for movies. The fact that it is on this site, probably
one of the most popular movie sites, if not the most popular movie site
on the net should tell you that these are legitimate scores coming from
people who love movies. This is not some poll on the side of the screen
on some misc website. This is IMDb and I trust the numbers here more
than I do anywhere else. Just because you don't agree with it doesn't
mean its not correct. 50% of the people who rated this movie gave it a
10 for gods sake. If that doesn't tell you something I don't know what
does.<br /><br />GotMyOrangeCrush<br /><br />&quot;My Experiences, though I would wish them on nobody else, have helped
make me what I am and what I still hope to be&quot;
