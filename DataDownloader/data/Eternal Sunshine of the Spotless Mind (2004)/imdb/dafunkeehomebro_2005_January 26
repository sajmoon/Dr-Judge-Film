Probably the best movie of 2004. Gondry shows how a director of music
videos can easily beat the big guys. Jim Carrey shows how great he
really is (he also did that in Man on the Moon). Beck turns a
disco-classic into a sentimental ballad. And it's one of the greatest
film-titles ever. Why is this movie not nominated for best picture for
the Oscars??????<br /><br />Haven't seen the nominated movies yet, but I'll vote for Scorsese. Only
because he's one of the best, but it isn't really objective 'cause I
didn't see The Aviator.<br /><br />Okay, let's wait and find out!!!
