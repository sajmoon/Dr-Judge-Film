This is a great looking film, top directing, superb acting and a
quality script. Even so I came away feeling unsatisfied. Jim Carrey is
an excellent actor and he worked with Kate Winslet very well. Its just
a shame this movie feels like it has a inferiority complex.<br /><br />It dwelt on the mind erasure process far to long. I respect that they
wanted to relate the romance to memories etc, etc.. but they lost an
opportunity to make a great film and ultimately made tosh. This film is
as pointless as Lost In Translation.<br /><br />A visually stunning film that never really gets to grips with its plot.
However the performances of the leads are good enough to make one care
for the characters we are expected to explore.<br /><br />At the end of the day a boring film.
