I really really enjoyed this film although many of my friends told me
it was strange I thought it was brilliant. Many parts were very
confusing but I did follow it and it was incredible interesting as well
as funny. All the characters were excellent and Joel and Clementine in
particular were very easy to get attached to. It was a very original
idea and the whole film in my opinion was handled fantastically! Jim
Carrey and Kate Winslet played roles that were unlike their usual
stereotypical ones, really well. I didn&#39;t seem like Jim Carrey to me
without the outrageous gags and over-the-top humour but I really liked
it. Overall excellence. Funny, touching, thoughtful and intelligent I
would happily see it again and probably will do!
