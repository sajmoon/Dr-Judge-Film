I had shown Eternal sunshine for 10 times. Now, I get a chance to make
a review here. What I like the film most? the chemistry between Jim
Carrey and Kate Winslet. Unbelievable, that Jim Carrey can act like
that. Not stupid but boring man. Usually I seen Jim Carrey movie like
comedy such as Ace Ventura, dumb and dumber. But he is kind of
different he. He really merge to Joel Barish character. Boring man but
make us pity and love him at once. Kate Winslet, did a good act too
here. I love the way Kate Winslet express the Clementine character. She
made Clementine lovable, cheer full but also insecure. very human.
Michel Gondry did a good job here and also Charlie Kauffman (I also
like Being John Malkovich, very original).. the point is, eternal
sunshine is the most romantic film ever...Two thumbs up.
