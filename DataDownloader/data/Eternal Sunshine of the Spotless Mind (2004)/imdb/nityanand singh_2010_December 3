How happy is the blameless vestal&#x27;s lot!<br /><br />The world forgetting,by the world forgot.<br /><br />Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! <br /><br />Each prayer accepted, and each wish resign&#x27;d.<br /><br />- Alexander Pope<br /><br />I truly loved this movie and the way of narration was lovely,
marvelous. Michel Gondry moves aside from the typical romance angle and
takes us deep in the complexions of Human mind, and its immense
possibilities. <br /><br />The movie is a realization that only when we begin to lose someone,we
realize that we just want to cling on to that person forever because
there definitely was something about him/her that attracted us to that
person in the first place and we shouldn&#x27;t take that for granted and
focus on their other annoying habits etc.
