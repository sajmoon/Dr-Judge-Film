I don't think there are enough appraisal words to bring to this movie.
I watched it while going thru a depressive heartbreak, and it proved to
be the perfect remedy. This is not just a movie, it is a brilliant
&quot;painting&quot; about deep feelings, about love's eternal comeback victory,
about people we don't appreciate until we lose them, about hope, fear
and everything that comes with love's hard road journey. This movie
will haunt you with flashbacks long after you've seen it, making you
watch it again and again. Jim Carrey didn't win the Oscar, as I've
expected to, but I think its better this way, the prize for Best Actor,
would have been too little for his enormous talent. He showed everyone
that he is not just a comedy actor with silly moves, but that he can
play drama very well, making the character look very natural, and this
makes him a perfect actor, an exceptional one I must say. I was also
very impressed with Kate Winslet's playing. She was absolutely lovable
and charismatic making the character's messy way of living very
impressive. With this role and the one in &quot;Finding Neverland&quot; she has
established herself as one of the most talented and respectful
actresses of our times. Also, great music by Jon Brion and Beck, it
stuck to my mind for weeks. Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman have made
a masterpiece hard to equal by anyone, even by themselves I guess.
Remember, if you're ever feeling down, this is the movie to watch! It
will probably hurt a little, but it will bring to you serenity.
