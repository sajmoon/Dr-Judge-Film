I was so delighted to see Carrey move out of his funny-man roles into a
role that could have been played well by Tom Hanks a few years back. So
gifted in his visual humor, I was happy to see him just be a low-key
gentle guy. And what a great movie - kind of like a kinder, gentler
Memento in its boundary stretching view. I really enjoyed it and wished
I had spent the money to see it on the big screen. I wish we had a
classics theater that would show second chance films for those of us
who don't run out to see big screen movies unless we KNOW it is a big
screen movie like X men, Spiderman, or The Lord off the Rings Trilogy.
I gave it a 10/10 for creativity.
