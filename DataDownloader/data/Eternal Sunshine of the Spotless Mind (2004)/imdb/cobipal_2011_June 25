Hey guys, this movie is brilliant. I always make it sure that I watch a
movie above the 8 rating in IMDb and it was worth the watch. The name
of the movie says it all &#x22;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.&#x22; It&#x27;s
mind-blowing, very interesting, and outstanding. Jim Carrey&#x27;s role is
brilliant and so is Kate Winslet. You get a taste of what it feels like
to watch a crazy, wackadoo like Jim with the Titanic star Kate.
Needless to say that, Kate&#x27;s personality in this movie is more or less
matching that of Jim&#x27;s. She is witty, humorous, and darn interesting.
While Jim is sort of serious man going over his daily life like any
other ordinary employee. On meeting Kate, Jim&#x27;s life turn upside down.
But the main twist in the movie is when they erase their minds and
ultimately they realize that they were made for each other. An 18 year
old like me would love this movie.
