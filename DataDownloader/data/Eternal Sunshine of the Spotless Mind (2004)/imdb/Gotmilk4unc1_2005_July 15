Well. What to say about this movie. I never got the chance to view it
up until recently, almost a year after its release. Finally, when I saw
it I just thought it was a shear masterpiece.<br /><br />Jim Carrey, in what I believe was his most serious and dramatic role in
any of his films, was amazing. He, along with Kate Winslet were perfect
for their roles. Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) runs through all of his
memories with his former girlfriend, Clementine Kruczynski (Kate
Winslet) with intentions to erase his memory of her. I think the
director, Michel Gondry portrayed Carrey's sense of holding on and
confusion. I loved how the script was laid out. The movie flowed very
well.<br /><br />If you're looking for a movie to watch for years to come, this is your
movie. It's simply a masterpiece. I highly recommend you purchase this
movie on DVD asap. You will not be disappointed.
