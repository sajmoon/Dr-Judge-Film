I'm not going to get too in depth into this.. probably the best break
up or Couples film to watch. Even if you're single and never dated you
can learn almost all about the relationships between a man and a woman
the good, the bad, and the ugly in this film.. Watch it now before you
watch King Kong even. Ace Ventura ( Jim Carey) Rocks and so does Mary
Jane (kristen Dunst?) from spider man. The names aren't important what
is important is that the show is decent budget, but down to earth,
gritty yet abstract and all the time exceptionally real. It is in my
top ten movies of all time and also is a safe film for the children
although they will probably not grasp the theme, therefore not get the
movie and just be oblivious, I recommend this film for everyone,
however if I had to force an age group I'd say 15-30 years of age.
