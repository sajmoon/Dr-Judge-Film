In which a voluntarily &#x22;brain-damaged&#x22; Jim Carrey attempts to squirrel
memories of Kate Winslet into places it doesn&#x27;t belong, during a neat
inversion of the Orpheus and Eurydice myth: if he doesn&#x27;t look back,
she&#x27;s history. Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s forceful counter-argument to Henry
Ford&#x27;s &#x22;History is bunk!&#x22; is arguably his most accomplished and moving
story to date.<br /><br />At the public screening I caught, couples-watching was compulsory. In
the row in front of me, a young man made as if to caress his
girlfriend&#x27;s shoulder, as she subtly, perhaps unconsciously, pulled
away, while his hand dropped slowly to his lap again. As the lights
went up, the couples left the auditorium, silently and not touching,
preoccupied in their thoughts. I was single at the time. I laughed,
silently.
