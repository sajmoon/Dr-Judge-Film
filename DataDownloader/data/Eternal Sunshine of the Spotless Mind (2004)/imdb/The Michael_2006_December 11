For you people who don&#39;t think Jim Carry isn&#39;t a great actor, just
watch this movie. the Michael loves a lot of Jim Carry&#39;s work, but by
far this is his best film yet. An extraordinary film about two people
who&#39;s fate is to always be with each other, (scoring movie for you guys
out there.) (No offense to you women reading this), but aside from that
you have a film with some awesome effects and trippy screen plays,
which add up to the most creative and most original movie I have ever
seen. Brovo for Kate Winslet and Kirsten Dunst for their terrific
acting, and to the acting of everyone in the movie. (can&#39;t forget about
them). In conclusion, the Michael thinks this movie will be remembered
by all who watch it. (HINT, HINT). Truly one of my favorites. the
Michael has spoken.
