Am I being over the top here? I don't think so. To anyone who's ever
had writer's block, this film is the cure; at least for me. Kaufman has
a great talent for getting to a the core of a premise and then bringing
it to fruition as a feature script. In this one he starts with the
simple concepts of memory and emotion. Think about what you would do if
you wanted to make a film about those two concepts. Of course, he had
collaboration on the story with Gondry and Bismuth; and I am unaware of
who is responsible for what. But, as the extra features on the DVD
explain, the premise is based on the postcard device. Suppose you saw a
postcard in the mail from your recent ex, that stated they had you
erased from their memory? The implications and suggestions from that
premise make for a great story. As Carey also stated, Kaufman is
completely original with the story. That makes for a great excitement
in doing the film. For Carey, Winslet, Kaufman and Gondry, being a part
of this film must be like achieving the self-actualization that Maslow
spoke of. How incredible.
