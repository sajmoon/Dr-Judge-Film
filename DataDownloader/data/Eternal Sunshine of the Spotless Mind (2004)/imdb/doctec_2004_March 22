Of all Kaufman's screenplays that delve into the interior landscapes of
its
characters, Eternal Sunshine is the most fully formed and moving story of
the bunch, a rumination on the possibilities and consequences inherent in
making the process of removing unwanted memories from your consciousness
as
easy as going for a checkup.  Kaufman here plays on our desire to forget
the
bad things that happen to us and what happens when we are given the power
to
forget those things permanently, and the conclusion he arrives at is that
it
ultimately creates as many - if not more - problems than it solves.  At
the
very least, it can result in making the same mistakes again (&quot;Those who
ignore history are doomed to repeat it&quot;); at the worst, it eliminates the
possibility of our ever reconciling and coming to terms with our life
experiences, the way we relate to the people who help to shape our lives
and
whose lives we shape through ours.<br /><br />The film explores these ideas in a novel and engaging way: by taking the
audience inside the mind of Joel Barish (Jim Carrey), a man who, after
breaking up with his girlfriend Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslett),
discovers later that she has had her memory of him wiped clean from her
mind.  He finds out how she had this procedure done and, despondent not
only
about the breakup but even more so about her having completely erased him
from her mind, searches out the doctor who performed the procedure and
signs
up to have the same procedure done to him, so that he may also have no
memory of her.  He is rendered unconscious for the procedure but his
subconscious is still active.   Once the procedure is initiated and he
becomes aware that his memories of the woman he loved - and still loves -
are vanishing from his brain, he starts having second thoughts and wants
the
procedure stopped.  His challenge then becomes to figure out how to
protect
as much of his memory of her as he can, and to find a way stop the
procedure
despite the fact that he is in an unconscious state.<br /><br />The manner in which he comes to realize and confront his dilemma is played
out entirely within his interior landscape, a realm which (as anyone who
remembers their dreams upon waking from sleep can attest) is a very
surreal
extension of our day-to-day experiences.  Michel Gondry's visual style and
direction works exceptionally well here in conveying the slippery, chaotic
unpredictability of the worlds we construct from our memories and
experiences; the clever interplay between this interior world and the
goings-on of the outside world helps keep the viewer off-balance just
enough
to illuminate the fuzzy line of demarcation separating the two worlds and
the peculiar manner in which they play off one another.<br /><br />Jim Carrey and Kate Winslett do an exceptional job of bringing this
abstract
story concept to life with characters that are endearing, poignant,
believable and utterly human.  The supporting players are equally
impressive: Tom Wilkinson as the mind-eraser doctor, Mark Ruffalo and
Elijah
Wood as the technicians, Kiersten Dunst as the receptionist all have
relationships to the main protagonists and to one another that come to
light
as the story unfolds and help to propel the plot; as friends of Joel and
Clementine, David Cross and Jane Adams are hilarious as a couple who seem
to
be stuck in the same rut that compelled the protagonists to break up and
have each other erased from their respective minds.  Kaufman juggles all
these relationships masterfully and in such a way as to ensure none of
them
are superfluous to the ideas he is trying to get across in this
story.<br /><br />While there are elements of the plot that seem to place this movie in the
realm of science fiction, the focus of the movie stays on the interior
states, emotions and relationships between the characters.  As such, the
film is more of a romantic comedy than anything - albeit unlike any other
romantic comedy you're ever likely to see.  I saw a late showing of this
movie with my girlfriend the day it was released at a local multiplex and
there were only 20 or so people in the theater, yet at the film's
conclusion
everyone broke out in a spontaneous round of applause.  This gives an idea
of how compelling this movie can be.  If you give this film a chance to
creep under your skin, you will likely find yourself reflexively thinking
about your feelings toward the important people in your life, as well how
you relate to those feelings, as well as your memories and how you relate
to
them.  A thought provoking, moving and entertaining film - I can imagine
that a working title of this film might have been &quot;Warts And
All.&quot;
