How many times, have we as humans wished to forget someone. Maybe an
uncorresponding love, a relative who has passed away or a long time
girlfriend who is going to study outside the country. Maybe not a
person, but a shameful situation, that time you made a fool on stage or
when you just couldn&#39;t contain a gas any longer. Now imagine that by a
medical treatment you would be able to forget, just like that. That is
what happens to Joel&#39;s (Jim Carey) girlfriend Clementine (Kate
Winslet).<br /><br />When Joel finds out she has decided to forget him, he decides to
undertake the same process in order to erase Clementine out of his
mind.<br /><br />Joel goes home and goes to sleep, the therapists then come in to apply
the treatment. Joel will experience each of his memories involving
Clementine in a reverse chronological order, from his last memory until
the day he met her. Here we are transported into Joel&#39;s mind and at
this point is were the expression &quot;Don&#39;t know what you have until its
gone&quot; is applied. Joel finds out he does love CLementine and has now to
try to stop a delete process which is no longer under his control.<br /><br />Both of the main performances are genius. Carey proves he can act just
as well in a more serious movie. Kate Winslet character is just
amazing, I instantly fell in love with her. There is also a side story
involving the therapists Kirsnt Dursnt, Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo and
Tom Wilkinson, which deals on the ethical view of doctors, patients and
the treatments they use. Michael Gondry&#39;s direction is also five stars,
with amazing landscape and screenplay. He has proved to be something
else than a good music video director. Finally I would like to say this
is the type of movie you will enjoy better if your significant other is
by your side. Sometimes few bad moments make us forget the great ones
we have spent.
