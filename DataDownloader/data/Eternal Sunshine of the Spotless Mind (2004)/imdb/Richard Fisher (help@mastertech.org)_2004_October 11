Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind<br /><br />Joel Barish goes to meet his girlfriend Clementine one day only to find
that she does not know him and finds out later that she had her memory
of their relationship erased, no explanation given and none to be
found. Joel in his misery decides to do the same so he can overcome his
grief.<br /><br />This artsy movie plays with the time line and if you don't understand
the story going in you could get either lost or frustrated. It was also
unusual in that the beginning credits show up about 20 minutes into the
story. The movie begins in the present and then switches to the past
where we find Joel in his grief as the beginning credits start. We are
then taken through the process of Joel having his memories of
Clementine erased. During this sequence Lacuna Inc., the provider,
presents us with a most severe case of doctor/patient confidentiality
breach and irresponsibility that may have you thinking twice about
trusting anyone again. While unrealistic in scope these scenes
generated some expletives from me during the movie. The procedure on
Joel is completed returning us to the present and we now have a much
better grip on how this movie began and finally discover why Clementine
and Joel chose the procedure. That crucial bit of information brings
the art of this film full circle for a final mind bending and thought
provoking view on intimate relationships that had me fast rewinding the
complete movie in my mind for a final wow!<br /><br />The IMDb seems hard pressed to find a genre that this movie fits
stating, drama, romance, sci-fi and comedy for this listing. The DVD
cover promotes it as a comedy. All apply except comedy unless you find
people being cruel to each other, incompetence or utter stupidity
funny, i.e. Lacuna Inc. This is a new trend for Hollywood as of late
which they call comedy and I seem to be unable to find any humor in. I
would definitely label this as a drama with award winning potential in
many categories. It certainly has it's humor but only as a natural
progression of the tale that is being told.<br /><br />Is it the name Jim Carry that forces Hollywood to market his movies as
comedy? For me Jim has had a riddled past of great and mediocre films.
Ace Ventura and The Mask presented us with the smart comedy side of
Jim. Liar Liar is the ultimate classic that derives all of it's humor
from the pressing seriousness of the situation playing into Jim's
shtick beautifully. The Truman Show was his first real attempt at drama
which would have played far better if they would not have promoted the
typical Jim Carry comedic delivery through out which was simply at odds
with the context of the story. I really liked that movie and the
message it provided but alas Hollywood and it's marketing foibles is
what prevents it from being a classic. This new movie presents us with
the full dramatic potential of Jim Carry while leaving his typical
shtick behind proving finally that this man should be considered a
serious dramatic actor capable of various parts. The rocky life story
of Jerry Lewis cries out for the actor Jim Carry! Maybe this movie
brings Jim to a point where he could provide that potential Oscar
winning performance as that story will require him to make us laugh and
cry with tears in our eyes in both cases.<br /><br />A lengthy review means mis-perception could spoil the film, I lack
confidence in my recommendation or the presentation does not follow our
normal expectations and in this case it seems to be all of the above.
For the life of me I cannot figure out why my wife did not like it. Was
it the artsy presentation? She did mention her frustration a few times
during the movie. Was it the gut reeling conclusion that ultimately was
too realistic causing self reflection? Was it the despicable behavior
of Lacuna Inc.? She waffled as I tried to figure out what her take was
which left me with only one question to ask her, 'Would you recommend
the movie to a friend'? No was the final response.<br /><br />This movie will not leave you with romantic fuzzy feelings and is not
your typical chick flick romantic genre. I would suggest the reason
this movie failed in the market is because it was too realistic in
driving home it's point about long term intimate relationships and true
love causing too much inner reflection for the viewer, especially
women. One could say this is a guys version of a chick flick that guys
would appreciate. This is not simple entertainment for an evening of
smiles and gushy romance only.<br /><br />For me this was an excellent example of the application of art to story
telling and cinematography promoting thought for this viewer at every
turn rather than just mere 'boy meets girl' romantic entertainment.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
