In (a bunch of minutes) less than two hours i could appreciate a film
ignoring everything about it: usually radio and TV advertising tease
you about the film and the director's career for weeks.. In this case
it was a pleasure to discover only at the end that the man behind the
camera is the genial, fresh and unique Michel Gondry: i must admit that
every time i saw a Gondry's video, from a Kylie Minogue's &quot;Come into my
world&quot; or a Rolling Stone's &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; or a White Stripe's &quot;Fell
in love with a girl&quot;, i felt &quot;well, this man is a fantastic child!!&quot;.
He plays equally with logic and technologies. And this &quot;Eternal
Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; is even better: it gains the
completeness of a full-length film. A film that is a closed and perfect
circle built upon a simple plot about memory erased. Light years
distant from the un-closed and un-satisfactory &quot;Memento&quot;, &quot;Eternal
Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; is a surprising oniric flight with a
beginning and a end. ..How easy it is to tell to a stranger what we
think of our partner and we never say.. So just a big Thank You to Jim
Carrey for the vulnerability and Compliments to Michel Gondry: you made
a perfect, yet conversed reversed diverse perverse and funny, circle!
