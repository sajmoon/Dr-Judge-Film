On a Valentine Day, Joel Barish feels the impulse of going to Montauk
instead of working. After spending the cold day on the beach, he meets
Clementine Kruczynski on the train station and they have a crush on
each other. Joel and Clementine do not know that they were mates in the
past. Joel has just erased Clementine from his memories when he found
that Clementine did exactly the same, when their relationship ended.
However, along his erasing process, Joel becomes astonished when he
finds that he still loves Clementine and he does not want to lose her,
fighting for keeping the memories of their moments together instead.<br /><br />This is a movie that makes you think and could break your heart at the
same time. It&#39;s your different kind of romantic comedy and it&#39;s a great
addition to Charlie Kaufman&#39;s writing. The great work of CGI and camera
work draws in the viewers because they are so amazing! The acting by
Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are really fantastic. I never have anything
to say about great films like this. It has an emotional core and one of
the best films ever made.
