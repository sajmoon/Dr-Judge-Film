There&#39;s something that every great writer worth his weight in Number
Two pencils knows about love, (as did the immortal Debbie Harry when
she sang the phrase above). And it&#39;s this: as fragile as it is and
therefore worth handling with the utmost care, none of us really know a
damn thing about it or how to deal with it. Besides, when we fall in
love with someone and they with us, we&#39;re not falling for one person,
but three: the one that swept us off our feet in the first place; the
person whom we hope they will become as we grow old together, and the
person that they really are at the end of the day.<br /><br />And as our loved ones are a trio and not just one personality, our
relationships ebb and flow in three stages: love&#39;s first rapturous
blush, the &quot;big reveal&quot; as we begin to find out things about this
person that we love and hate, and the Last Stage, when the bloom is
completely off the rose, and you have a decision to make--continue the
journey on together, or find another traveling companion.<br /><br />All of the above and more is eloquently and brilliantly expressed in
one of the best movies ever made on the subject, ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF
THE SPOTLESS MIND. It comes as no big surprise that the co-author of
this damn-near perfect deconstruction of desire and disappointment is
one Charlie Kaufman (BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, ADAPTATION). One of the
bigger shocks is that the other writer and director is Michel Gondry,
to whose work I have only been previously exposed via the hit-and-miss
Robin Williams vehicle HUMAN NATURE. (Thank goodness that my first
impression wasn&#39;t at all accurate. Ditto for Kaufman, who was just
&quot;testing his swing&quot; before hitting a homer with MALKOVICH.) <br /><br />We begin by meeting everyman Joel Barish (Jim Carrey), a nice if
somewhat non-descript guy, living a pretty much non-descript existence,
his hopes, dreams, fears and desires neatly compartmentalized from the
rest of his life inside his journal. Joel is sensible, practical,
polite, thoughtful and never, ever impulsive. Then, he meets his polar
opposite, Clementine, (Kate Winslet exploding out of Corset World). She
is erratic, impulsive, confrontational, messy, intrusive and everything
Joel couldn&#39;t possibly be on his worst day without Starbuck&#39;s. There is
no reason on God&#39;s green earth they should be attracted to each other,
but what do ya know? They are.<br /><br />And things go great for awhile, then from great to good, good to okay,
okay to not-so-good, etc. When it gets beyond the last stage,
Clementine decides that she wants Joel erased from her life forever,
and as she is prone to do, she impulsively goes to a place called
Lacuna, Inc., which specializes in just that...erasures. They literally
wipe the slate clean - that slate being your mind - so that no trace
and no memories of your ex will ever plague you again.<br /><br />Already heartbroken, when the devastated Joel learns what Clementine
has done, he decides to do the same...only to discover (or re-discover)
that not all the times they had together were awful, and that some
memories are worth keeping forever, no matter what. And what he decides
to do to try and hold on to those memories are where the story really
kicks into gear, turning sublime, silly and very sad all at once.<br /><br />The joys and sorrows of discovering a tale this remarkable are always
best experienced without a lot of foreknowledge, and that&#39;s how I will
leave the more startling and surprising details...for you to find.<br /><br />All I can say is this: if no one had ever seen a Jim Carrey film before
and this was his introduction to the world, it would be like seeing Tom
Hanks for the first time. That is how complete and profound his
transformation is into Joel. We like him, we REALLY, REALLY like him,
and though we hardly want to see him suffer, we realize soon enough
that what he goes through with &quot;darlin&#39; Clementine&quot; is totally
necessary to transform them both into better people.<br /><br />Oh, yes, and there&#39;s Clemmy, herself. I always knew that Kate was dying
to sink her teeth into a role that didn&#39;t require a corset and a
bustle. (Helena Bonham Carter, eat your heart out!) If you are still
wincing over TITANIC&#39;S thick treacle, her performance in SUNSHINE will
come as a tart but tasty surprise.<br /><br />And kudos must be given to the strong supporting cast. Kirsten Dunst
showing a winsomeness she hasn&#39;t accessed in many moons; Elijah Wood in
a role that is somehow slimy, pathetic and yet movingly sympathetic;
Tom Wilkinson, Jane Adams and David Cross whose solid and invaluable
work is integral to the plot, (but can&#39;t be commented on here without
giving up some glaring spoilers), and Mark Ruffalo, who does the nearly
impossible by making man-boy geekiness sexy.<br /><br />Most of all, we have to go back and high-five director Gondry, DP Ellen
Kuras and editor Valdis Oskarsdottir for recognizing the special story
that Kaufman fashioned, for letting it breathe and allowing it to go
where it needed...to show the destructive and transforming power of
love, and how and WHY we need it, no matter how high it lifts us
up...or how hard it lets us fall.<br /><br />Everyone will take something different away from this, so see it with
someone you&#39;re dating...or even someone you&#39;re breaking up with. You
never know what might happen, and even at the worst times, there could
still be good that comes from it...just ask Joel and Clem.
