Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is my favorite film. Every
character is rich and full of depth, the emotions are subtle but
absolutely real, and Jim Carrey gives us the finest acting we have ever
seen from him.<br /><br />The concept of the film is an astonishing creation that could only be
Kaufman-esquire but the addition of Michel Gondry is delightful. His
low special effects camera work and film-making style astounds me. The
cinematography is some of the best that I&#39;ve ever seen especially
during the erasing process feeling which felt like a real dream with
all its confusions and contortions. Eternal Sunshine was the first
movie that I could personally watch over and over and get new emotions
every time. I love every character for their flaws and the actors&#39;
amazing abilities to create completely real people is spectacular.<br /><br />This film was completely ignored come Oscar time (besides its deserved
screenplay award and Kate Winslet&#39;s acting nod). Jim Carrey (acting),
Michel Gondry (directing), Jon Brion (score), Ellen Kuras
(cinematography), and the special effects team should have been
nominated for all their respective categories.<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine is the best movie to convey the them of love, loss of
love, and redemption that I have ever seen in my entire life. Jim
Carrey is one of the finest dramatic actors we have working these days
and I wish that he could do more movies like this and The Truman Show.
