This was one of the best movies I've seen this year. One suggestion
though to anyone that likes to read user reviews prior to watching the
movie. Read the back box before you start the movie! I don't usually
like to pollute my opinions by reading others. Or even read the full
jacket cover on something I've been told to watch. I'm glad I didn't,
having said that you really have to pay attention in the beginning to
fully appreciate this film.<br /><br />Jim Carey has earned my utmost respect as an actor with this film.
Fireman Bill is far removed from his persona in this film. After
watching the extras on the DVD it appears that Mr.Carey poured his
heart and soul into this role using some of his own personal
experiences with love to become consumed by this character. This is all
self-evident in the 1st 10 minutes.<br /><br />For anyone that's been around a few years and loved and lost this film
will envelop you. The unique perspectives obtained in filming allowed
for an earthy feel to many scenes. Most all of the special effects in
this film were NOT CGI. They, in most scenes, were accomplished by
using simple camera angles, &quot;tricks&quot; and perspectives. <br /><br />The only puzzling part of this film was, &quot;Why was Kirsten Dunst in it?&quot;
Aside from a chance to see her in underwear and panties her character
could have easily been non-existent. Nothing against Kirsten. I think
she's done some interesting work and maybe this was an attempted by her
to enter the &quot;Independent Film&quot; genre. In fact, I think maybe her
placement in this film, given the timing of the initial release, was
simply to bolster ticket sales. Don't get me wrong I think she does
well as an actress just not here. It would have been interesting to see
how her character worked only using the &quot;mush face&quot; technique. <br /><br />Kate Winslet....was absolutely amazing in this movie. I really really
fell in love with her. She plays the quintessential
girlfriend/lifemate. I'm not sure if her character was written or
performed but she played every true romantics fantasy perfectly. It
must also be said that this was almost a role reversal between her and
Jim Carey's typical role. Again as with Mr. Carey I've developed a
whole new respect for her acting talent after watching this film. <br /><br />After all this long winded, subtle and puzzling retrospective don't
miss this film. I think that films shot, directed and produced in this
&quot;Independent film&quot; style NEVER get a fair shake, and there's many that
shouldn't. This movie was definitely missed by the main stream, but
that's OK, I think it's a true treasure with real heart and sustenance.<br /><br />We can all only hope that every burgeoning young film student would
strive for the accomplishments of this film and use it as a benchmark.
