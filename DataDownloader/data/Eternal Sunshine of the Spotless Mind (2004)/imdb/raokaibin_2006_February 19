This film has expressed the deep feeling of love, of relationship
between people to me, it's so warm when I have finished the film, 'I'm
fine without you', it was touchable. What's more, the way the director
annotates this film is quite interesting and novel, by erasing our
memories can we really forget things? Even people that we deeply loved
before? At last, I think King Karie's films are the most interesting,
very comfortable and acceptable. Although I have to admit that at first
sight I can not quite understand what was going on in the film,
however, when I finally realized what was happening, I suddenly felt
that I was the man whose memory had been erased, I cannot just lost my
girl just because of my impulsion. The spotless mind keeps its purity
thanks to the eternal sunshine, that is love, it's love that makes us
spotless. It's eternal love that makes us survive and live. Thank you,
this is an excellent film.
