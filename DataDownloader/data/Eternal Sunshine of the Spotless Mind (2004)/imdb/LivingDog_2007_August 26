This is a movie about modern relationships. Joel Barish (Carrey) meets
a messed up girl who turns his world around and then they break up.
However in this world the break ups can be made permanent by having
your memory wiped of that person.<br /><br />This speaks volumes about the weakness of the modern human. People are
rapidly becoming pale superficial material empty self-serving sociopath
mannequins of what humans once were. Once upon a time character
mattered; today it is laughed at.<br /><br />This movie&#39;s answer to the question: &quot;do you want who you are and the
experiences that have made you, erased?&quot; is indefatigably &quot;YES!&quot; If we
can have anything we want, and the thought of removing painful memories
from our lives is considered a blessing, then we are no longer humans -
just &quot;evolved&quot; neurological impulses.<br /><br />This movie is not about relationships. In essence it is about people&#39;s
own inability to be human. They refuse to live life with painful
memories -in essence they refuse to live. They want fast food memories
and that&#39;s OK. I use to think zombies didn&#39;t exist... nonetheless it is
well done. 8/10<br /><br />-LD<br /><br />______________________________________________<br /><br />my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/<br /><br />PS: the Bible says that in the end, people will be lovers of
themselves, but with no love in them. Indeed. But there is hope, if you
accept Christ into your heart.<br /><br />-LD
