Despite my desire to enjoy what I hoped would be a unique film, I found it
dark and self indulgent.  The superb acting couldn't overcome a script
that
is centered on a failed relationship that never makes sense to the viewer
or
to the lovers.  In the end you feel like this is &quot;Adaptation II&quot; - yet
another film about a brooding self-centered guy who can't really relate to
anyone beyond his own fantasy life.  The dramatic device ultimately used
in
the film of having the main character fight to preserve his memory fails
because it comes across as a clever but unsatisfying rendition of
psychotherapy.  The subplot is banal and adolescent.  In many ways this
entire film comes across as something that was done back in the 60's, but
which now falls flat.
