Films that intentionally blur the lines between the real and the
imagined, that completely defy our most basic sense of narrative
structure can often be off-putting and regarded as strange. Some
people, no matter how outside-the-box their thinking, will always see
&quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; this way. The title alone is a
red flag for conservative movie-goers. But the truth is that this film
is not abstract merely for the sake of style, but it is abstract
film-making with a clear purpose. Writer Charlie Kaufman and director
Michel Gondry make that purpose accessible the entire film and the
result is a unique and special film about the connection between memory
and relationship.<br /><br />&quot;Eternal Sunshine&quot; is about the relationship between Joel (Carrey) and
Clementine (Winslet), both of whom have decided to undergo a procedure
that would completely erase the other from his/her memory. The majority
of plot follows Joel as he seeks out the services of Lacuna, a practice
run by a doctor (Wilkinson) and his staff (Ruffalo, Dunst and Wood). As
they erase his memory overnight, the film plunges into a progression
from most recent to earliest of all of Joel&#39;s memories involving
Clementine. Things are complicated when a mostly unconscious Joel
decides, while in his own memories, that he has changed his mind.<br /><br />As Joel goes through his memories, things disappear, his environment
magically shifts from one to the next. Some of this is nifty camera
work, much of it is done by computer. It&#39;s hard to understand exactly
what&#39;s going on, but since the action takes place in Joel&#39;s mind, what
happens is a mix of Joel&#39;s actual memory and his mind&#39;s interaction
with it. It&#39;s a brilliant and surreal trip through someone&#39;s mind that
exposes more and more about this relationship as it goes, also asking
questions along the way about whether erasing someone is ultimately an
effective way of dealing with loss.<br /><br />It&#39;s a pleasure seeing Carrey take on dramatic role successfully. He
seems to be able to channel his goofy energy into the neurotic and
self-conscious Joel. Winslet proves her own versatility in taking on
Clem, who is a free-spirited fireball, not her traditional dramatic
performance, but she really demands your attention. Wilkinson and Dunst
also prove to be excellent dramatic side-fodder to illustrate another
perspective into the memory erasing concept.<br /><br />Excellent, realistic character portrayal combined with surreal visual
drama create a concept of love that while abstract, manages to identify
with us because there&#39;s a wild, imaginative side of love that only
exists in our individual minds. Through the entire film, Gondry makes
sure we see the very high and very low points of a relationship and it
creates a feeling that Joel and Clementine are meant for each other
despite obvious proof that they are somewhat incompatible. This helps
further push the film&#39;s themes.<br /><br />While &quot;Eternal Sunshine&quot; can get confusing and test one&#39;s limits at
times, a concentrated viewing will show how honest and truthful this
film is to not only human relationships, but to the human psyche.
