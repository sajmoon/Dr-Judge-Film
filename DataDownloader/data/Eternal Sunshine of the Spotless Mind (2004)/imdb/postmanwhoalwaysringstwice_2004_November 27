&quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; is the most recent film from
Charlie Kaufman, the screenwriter who has become a phenomenon as the
only writer in contemporary film (with the exception of
writer/directors) whose name rattles off moviegoers' tongues...<br /><br />[As is the expectation of commenting on IMDb, I too will list some of
the other Kaufman written flicks that I enjoyed.]<br /><br />...You see, he's the writer behind &quot;Adaptation&quot; and &quot;Being John
Malkovich&quot;. The latter film shares the most in common with &quot;Eternal
Sunshine&quot;, which is very much a two hour version of the chase scene
through Malkovich's subconscious. The film stars Jim Carrey, who seems
light years away from &quot;Ace Ventura&quot; in a particularly subdued
performance, and Kate Winslet, who has given consistently strong
performances since 1994's &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; and I feel is one of the
finest actresses working today, as well as a small roster of wonderful
talent (the overlooked Mark Ruffalo, as well as Elijah Wood, Kirsten
Dunst, and Tom Wilkinson).<br /><br />It's an intellectually engaging film, which I think really detracts
from the whole romantic, emotional impact. I never fully felt like the
relationship that the two leads erase seemed much more than tortured
unrequited love and full of mind games, but maybe that was the point.<br /><br />It's a really fine film, and well worth a look, which is likely what
you will hear from just about everyone.<br /><br />So why haven't you seen it yet?
