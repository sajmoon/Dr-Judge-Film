There's a girl or two I would like to have erased from my mind, but
just like this movie shows, there were some good times that I had with
them that I would like to remember,no matter how much they hurt. This
movie did a great job looking at that idea and the way it was
presented, which was so confusing at first, looks so clever upon the
second viewing of the movie.<br /><br />This movie isn't a sci-fi movie. It takes a little twist on reality,
but really, it's not like the whole erasing thing couldn't happen if
they tried. The movie had some great acting work, a whole lot of
memorable quotes that I know I can apply to my life, and the whole
Kristen Dunst story was intriguing too an added an awesome sideline
story. If you haven't seen this movie, give it a chance. It'll take you
back and make you remember when, but it's worth the trip.
