Just because a movie is confusing and hard to understand doesn't mean
it's great. A movie of this kind is either simple so obviously it has
no mistakes, or is complex bs so it has no obvious mistakes. There was
no moral in this story, but how sci-fi is trying to be introduced into
reality. People who think this movie was great are usually just trying
to seem as if they are somewhat intelligent and know what's going on
while others don't. This just shows who these people are, and in fact
this movie's only purpose might have been even this. I'm not just
somebody who doesn't understand but the shallowest crap, I just know
when directors are trying to make a movie enjoyable, or they just want
a moral out of it, and this movie did neither. This movie just sucked!!
