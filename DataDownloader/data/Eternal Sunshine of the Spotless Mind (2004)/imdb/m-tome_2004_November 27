2004_November 27 
A little vanilla sky, sweet November(was good though), and just a bunch
of freaks. Not funny, fails at its attempts to be a love story which I
guess I'm not a fan of any way. Wow! I guess I'm one of the few that is
trashing this movie. Go head and watch and unless you watch so many
movies that one so far off the beatin' path of good actually seams good
to you, then you wont like it either. I feel that the writers have run
out of ideas or had too much time on there hands for them to think this
is something investors would pit there caassh on. Hodeho off we go to
see another good one. I like most movies I see, 95% at least. This is
different.<br /><br />W-o-time
