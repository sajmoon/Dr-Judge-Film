The latest dark comedy from the pen of Charlie Kaufman stars Jim Carrey
as a man who discovers that his ex-girlfriend (Kate Winslet) has had
their relationship erased from her memories. He goes to the same doctor
(Tom Wilkinson) to have the process done to himself, but realizing he
still loves her, he tries his best to remember her, as the doctor and
his assistants chase him down to finish the process.<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is easily the best movie of 2004.
The story is very unique and original. The execution is flawless and
depressing yet still excellent. The movie is constantly engaging and it
will keep the viewer thinking throughout the whole thing, even after it
ends. The movie may be too depressing for some people though. Also, the
story is kind of twisted and weird so it&#39;s probably not for everyone.
Since it&#39;s a little out there, I was expecting to hate it yet ended up
loving it. The acting is very strong with the best being Kate Winslet.
Her character is very kind and hard to hate. She gives an excellent
performance and deserved an Oscar.<br /><br />Jim Carrey is surprisingly strong as Joel. He usually does over the top
comedies and it was nice to see him in a different type movie. Elijah
Wood was okay, his role is kind of small though. Mark Ruffalo was just
as good as Carrey though his character was a little annoying. I usually
hate Kirsten Dunst but here, she is surprisingly good. Overall, there
was not one sour performance in the entire film. A strong contender for
the best acting ensemble performance of 2004.<br /><br />Charlie Kaufman is of course the mastermind behind this and his writing
is especially amazing. His take on love is very interesting and very
enjoyable to watch. The music was great and it fit the film perfectly.
The movie was beautifully shot and everything looked so natural. The
movie is so good that you wonder why they don&#39;t make more movies like
this and less movies like Sleepover. The ending is perfect and the
movie should leave a happy feeling in you. There was really nothing
wrong with the film (at least in my eyes) and it&#39;s worth checking out.
In the end, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is the best movie of
2004. Rating 10/10
