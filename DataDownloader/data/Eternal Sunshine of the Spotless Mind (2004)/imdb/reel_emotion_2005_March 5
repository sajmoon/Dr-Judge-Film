Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind asks the question: if you could
lead a life without loss and unhappiness, would you really want to? It
can be described as part sci-fi, part black comedy, and part romance.
The characters are &quot;quirky,&quot; and I would be happy just to see a movie
between the bickering gen X couple played by Mr. Show's David Cross and
Happiness' Jane Adams. The cast is impressive, and there also is nice
plot twist in the end.<br /><br />On the negative side (or the positive side for some), the story seems
to be created by writers under the influence of recreational drugs. It
may be too surreal for some viewers. At first, the frame of the story
may seem impossible to follow, but be patient, and it is quite easy to
understand. All the questions are answered by the end of the movie. If
you can stay with the movie, you will find it entertaining and
meaningful.
