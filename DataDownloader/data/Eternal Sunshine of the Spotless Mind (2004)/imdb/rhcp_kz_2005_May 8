this by far, is one of the most emotional, breathtaking, heart
throbbing movies i have ever seen. I didn't cry once in the whole movie
but the whole time i was watching it, i felt i was gonna cry so hard
but the tears never came out. This movie hit me hard, harder than any
other movies have. Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey had such an adorable,
sad, loving, and wonderful chemistry. At the end, i was about to break.
what i loved most about the movie was its creativeness, not trying to
ruin the one of the greatest scenes of movies but, oh my gosh it was
just such good directing, and dialogue, and EVERYTHING. The little
things you notice but not too well are fantastic. And the way the story
is told is amazing and very clever. oh and did i mention this movie was
bursting with emotion? some words were hard to hear so i suggest
watching this movie with subtitles, because once you get everything
they say, you'll understand the movie a lot more. Its not the movies
fault because some of the dialogue has to be low to make it be felt
out. Overall, this is one of my favorite movies and i have seen a lot.
almost all of IMDb top 15. This movie deserves to be up there.<br /><br />I seriously recommend this movie. Go watch it now
