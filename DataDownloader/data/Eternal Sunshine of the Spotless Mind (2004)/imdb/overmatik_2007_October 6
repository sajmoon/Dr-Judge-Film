I&#39;ve just watched this film. It was going great until the credits
appearance. The constant changes between past and present, in a
confused and confusing way makes the viewer lost the focus.<br /><br />The linear time-line of a movie only can be altered with extreme care,
because you may compromise the whole movie. You have to watch this
movie more than once, no doubt about it.<br /><br />I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a bad movie, but it&#39;s miles away from what people
say about it. The concept was bad structured, the story doesn&#39;t evolve
and there&#39;s little connection between Joel and Clementine, and I would
dare to say that the movie is a bit pretentious too, with it&#39;s &quot;cult&quot;
design and &quot;impressive&quot; images.<br /><br />You can&#39;t follow the time-line, the screenplay isn&#39;t strong enough to
hold the attention to the picture. It won the Oscar, wow, such a big
thing. The same academy that gave the Best Picture Award to the
mediocre &quot;American Beauty&quot;. Please Jim, try to team up with Frank
Darabont again, he&#39;s a true genius! Well, just to show that you
shouldn&#39;t go with the flow when it comes to movies, music or
literature, you have to see it for yourself and take your own
conclusions...
