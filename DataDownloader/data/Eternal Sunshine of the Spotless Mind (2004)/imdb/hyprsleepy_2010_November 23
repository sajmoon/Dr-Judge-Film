It&#x27;s one of my favorite movies ever. I&#x27;ve never had a movie break me
down and make my heart ache the way this one did when I first watched
it (in the theater no less). Jim Carrey played Joel as a real person
and did so in such a believable way that I immediately became impressed
with his range when I had been lukewarm about his other attempts at
drama.<br /><br />I&#x27;ve known couples like Joel and Clementine and at some scenes I&#x27;ve
been them. Of my friends who didn&#x27;t like the movie they were always
people with no experience or very little. I think what makes people
love this movie is realizing how realistic it is and respecting that.<br /><br />One of the things that makes Eternal Sunshine stand out is its depth.
The movie has little hints for you to find and uncover if you watch it
multiple times. If you pay close attention you can see that Joel and
Clementine have probably erased each other more than once as have other
couples. It makes sense that if your memories are gone but who you are
as a person is the same that you&#x27;d find the same people attractive and
have the same desires and of course the same problems and issues. And
so one of the main points of the story is a reminder that, &#x22;Those who
forget history are doomed to repeat it&#x22;. Therefore, the only way to
grow as a person and progress is to keep your memories, no matter how
much it hurts.
