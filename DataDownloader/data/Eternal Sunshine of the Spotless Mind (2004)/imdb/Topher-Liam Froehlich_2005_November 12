ESOTSP (had to shorten it) <br /><br />I must say there is no movie I have ever seen quite like this. It is
very different. But that's not bad.<br /><br />The story is rather interesting. And the way it's presented even more.
For the majority of the film, we are traveling through the random
memories of Jim Carrey's mind, but also experiencing an evolving plot.
Very interesting and engaging.<br /><br />The acting is good; and when I say that I am referring to Carrey and
Winslet. They are the only ones to play these roles.<br /><br />This movie is unique, and worth viewing. It has a good and sensible
ending too. See it.<br /><br />&quot;Constantly talking, doesn't mean you're communicating&quot;-Eternal
Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
