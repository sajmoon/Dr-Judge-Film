&quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; is one of the more overrated
films of the past year. At best, one may say that the concept and
screenplay are &quot;clever.&quot; But the idea of remapping memory and the
unethical human erasers removing the painful experiences was a shallow
one. It is unfortunate that two fine performances by Jim Carrey and
Kate Wislet were wasted in this film. The best scene was their initial
meeting where we actually saw a believable and interesting relationship
unfold. In the combination of Winslet's quirky character and the
mild-mannered Carrey, I was reminded of a much superior film and
screenplay in &quot;The Sterile Cuckoo.&quot; With the outstanding dialogue and
unforgettable performance of Liza Minnelli, the film actually shed
light on human relationships and the emotional pain of breakups. By
contrast, &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; was no more than a
glorified gimmick. The film's title comes from the English poet
Alexander Pope. But a better tagline for this film would be
Shakespeare's image of &quot;weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable.&quot;
