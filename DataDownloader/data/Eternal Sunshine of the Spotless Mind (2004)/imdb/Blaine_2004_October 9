I fell in love with this movie right from the start. The director hit
every note perfectly from beginning to end. It's well paced and the
cinematography is first rate. Technically there's nothing to complain
about. The visual effects are believable, but all this only take the
backseat to what really stand out in this film - The script and the
acting. <br /><br />I've never been a fan of Kate Winslet, but here...WOW! She's brilliant.
Her performance is flawless. Her character, Clementine, is a
multi-dimensional, layered, complex woman, and Winslet really brings
her to life. It will be difficult for the Academy to overlook this in
February next year. And then there's Jim Carrey. Once again I'm
impressed with what he can do. He's probably one of the most underrated
actors in Hollywood, despite the fact that he has proven himself over
and over again to be a rock-solid dramatic actor. I would actually love
to see him in an Anthony Minghella-movie.<br /><br />When it comes to the script I can only tip my hat, and say
congratulations. You've done it again, Kaufman. It's reassuring to know
that the US still can produce great films with good stories and real,
human characters in them.<br /><br />See this movie, but stay away from Lacuna, Inc., because this is a
movie you don't want to forget.
