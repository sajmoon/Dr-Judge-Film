2005_February 4 
A movie of this magnitude and quality only comes out once in a great
while! <br /><br />Very rarely am I affected after viewing a movie, but after seeing this
film my view of the world slightly changed. &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the
Spotless Mind&quot;, in my opinion, is a masterpiece. <br /><br />This film takes your mind on a journey, to places you never even
THOUGHT about thinking about. Jim Carey and Kate Winslett are superb,
as are the writing and plot. <br /><br />Do not see this film expecting many dazzling CGI effects. This film
intrigues and astounds on sheer acting and plot alone. This
intelligent, science-fiction movie will require your full attention the
whole length of the film, or you are liable to become lost. Before
basing your opinion on this movie, I would recommend seeing it twice,
as you may not fully comprehend the plot the first time around. And
speaking of the plot, it is unique and not at all predictable. <br /><br />Please forgive the lack of structure to this review, but I am
consciously trying to convey my opinion of this wonderful work of art
without revealing ANY of the plot so that your experience will be as
affecting as possible, as it was for me.
