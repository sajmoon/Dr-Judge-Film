&quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; is an excellent romantic and
intriguing comedy-drama about two people who don&#39;t truly realize they
are in love until one loses the other. Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) is a
lonely yet sweet man who is looking for true love and the ideal woman.
His search ends when he meets Clementine Krucynksi (Kate Winslet), an
energetic and wild young woman. Clementine is everything Joel isn&#39;t...
at least not the Joel the world sees. The feelings locked up inside of
him are released through Clementine. They prove you do not have to make
love or kiss all the time to be in love. This couple can play music, in
the snow, go shopping, or just lounge around at home and the audience
can tell they are in love. But as time goes by, their relationship
begins to shatter and really goes to the extreme when Joel discovers
Clementine erased him from her mind, thanks to a brilliant doctor&#39;s
invention. Joel contacts the agency, Lacuna Inc., and its main doctor,
Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), for Joel to receive the same
operation. During the evening Dr. Mierzwiak and his team: another
doctor/technician (Mark Ruffalo), a lovestruck receptionist/assistant
(Kirsten Dunst), and a naive twentysomething (Elijah Wood)perform the
operation, Joel evaluates his relationship with Clementine and realizes
he is still in love with her and wishes to keep the memories of her.<br /><br />&quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; is an incredible film and one
of the greatest modern romantic comedies of our time. It is smart,
clever, and charming with an exceptional cast and an intelligent crew.
This movie received many excellent reviews and anyone that I&#39;ve known
that has seen it agrees. This movie is unique and makes the audience
think and comprehend of what is happening. A movie like that is superb.
You also get to see the gentle and serious side of Jim Carrey and the
wild and funny side of Kate Winslet, what you would think would be vice
versa. The supporting cast consisting of Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo,
Elijah Wood, and Tom Wilkinson is does a great job. Charlie Kaufman, as
always, writes a phenomenal script with such creativity and intellect.
Speaking of intellect, director Michel Gondry uses his own intellect to
make this film a spectacle. The shots are captivating and exhilarating. <br /><br />It is just a shame that a film with such an amazing story,
performances, and film-making did not receive many Academy Awards or
awards similar. This film was overlooked and should be appreciated.
&quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; is a romantic motion picture
unlike any other. It is definitely not one of those typical romantic
comedies when they both love each other without realizing it, blah blah
blah. This film captures beauty and the true quality of a great film.
&quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; is one of the greatest movies I
have ever seen, perhaps of all time, and anyone else who has will
agree.
