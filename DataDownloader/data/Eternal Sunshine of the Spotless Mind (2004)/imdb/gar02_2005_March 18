It is hard for me to relate my opinions of this film to you because it
sucked so much that I tried to erase it from my mind (quite unlike the
goal of the lead character who was struggling to retain his memories).
I think the acting was fine and that Jim Carey is a great actor, but,
unfortunately, the movie was just so boring. Also, I do not think there
is anything novel about the idea of erasing one's memories of a person
to try to make your life easier for you after a breakup, or trying to
recapture these memories once you realize you love them (the action
flick total recall, and I'm sure, a bunch of other flicks have such
concepts). This movie is just a sappy love story that is way too
psychedelic for my tastes. The weirdness of it all and the constant
frenzy to retain memories and the weird special effects actually gets
annoying after awhile and detracts away from the central theme of love
in the film because it is too mind distorting. In short, this film is
good for sappy artsy fartsy people who enjoy commenting about how
unique something is, when really; it's not that original and actually
gives you a psychedelic headache.
