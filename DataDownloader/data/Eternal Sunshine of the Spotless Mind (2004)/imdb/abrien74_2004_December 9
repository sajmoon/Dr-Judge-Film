I always get skeptical when Jim Carrey comes out with a new movie -
it's going to be Jim Carrey playing Crazy Carrey again. Been there,
done that, it's older than old. <br /><br />That said, I did not recognize Jim Carrey in his role as Joel and I did
not recognize his acting style in this particular movie. He was
absolutely incredible - completely different. I was shocked! Kate
Winslet, brilliant as always. I loved Kate in this role. Her accent was
perfect - sounded exactly like a friend of mine who was raised in
Brooklyn. <br /><br />I won't give a summary because I don't want to repeat everything that's
already been said. I will say this: Eternal Sunshine reminded me what
it's like to be totally heartbroken, which is why I cried at the end.
The acting is so good that I felt everything the characters felt - the
happiness, the amusement, the communication, the lack of communication,
the anger, the betrayal, the jealousy, the hatred, the
desperation...the absolute heartbreak. It must have been emotionally
draining for Kate and Carrey while making this movie. <br /><br />I highly recommend this film. It's a tad slow in parts, it's a tad
talky in parts, but I recommend it simply because the story is utterly
fascinating, the acting is incredibly real and the script is damn fine.
9/10 (9 because Kirsten Dunst annoys me)
