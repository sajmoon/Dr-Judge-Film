It&#39;s one thing to scramble a viewer&#39;s perception and expectations in
order to force a movie&#39;s unique reality (consider &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;)
-- it&#39;s another thing to gratuitously scramble a movie&#39;s plot to force
a viewer to try to figure out what&#39;s going on, expecting the viewer to
assume something so scrambled must be significant. This pleasant renter
movie is about attractive hip young characters with appealing hip
cotton outfits, messy hair and a mumbling way of interacting with each
other, but nothing more about them deserves a movie. The interpersonal
dynamics are pure Hollywood ordinary and once you get past the
scrambled plot you know all these people too well already. There is
only the neato idea of memory erasure using obsolescent 2003 laptop
computers -- how do you win an Oscar with only 256 megabytes of RAM?
