I cannot emphasize enough how much I hated this film. It was such an
interesting concept and the teasers made it look so good that I had to
go and see the movie. Unfortunately, as in so many cases, once you have
seen the trailer, the film is identical but has been made about two
hours longer. The end result is that you already know what is going to
happen and are left waiting for the end so that you can leave to talk
about how bad it all was...<br /><br />I desperately wanted this film to be good. I hoped it would be as
visually dramatic as the previews suggested. I prayed the cast would
live up to their reputations and bring it alive. What I found was that
no amount of desire was going to save this film. Avoid it at all cost.
