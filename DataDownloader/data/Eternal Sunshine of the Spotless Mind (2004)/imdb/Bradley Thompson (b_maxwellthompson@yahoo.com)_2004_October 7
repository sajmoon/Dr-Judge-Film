I have no problem with this movie. It is, at best, a good high concept
film. Good mind-bending stuff. What I have a problem with is how the
studios insist on publicing movies as something that they're not. Now,
I admit that I was going to rent this movie regardless of what it said
on the box. I like the writer, I liked the previews... what I don't
understand is why the studio found it necessary to sell it as a
hilarious comedy on the box. It is not a hilarious comedy. It is a good
film in other ways, but by no means is it a hilarious comedy. It's not
a comedy at all. It's a drama, and it may be Jim Carey's best roll to
date, in that he plays a rather subdued person, which is in stark
contrast to the character we all know him to be. So many films suffer
from false advertising... why make this out to be a comedy when it's
clearly not? Plenty of viewers would appreciate this film as a high
concept drama. The thought process of the studios continues to confound
me.
