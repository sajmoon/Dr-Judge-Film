A brilliant film...and, oddly, one of the most romantic (that I can
*recall*!!! ;~) that I can recall...oh, I think I wrote that, already.
Deja vu all over again!<br /><br />There are too many posts for me to examine here, but has anyone
commented on the great, metaphorical &amp; archetypical use of the
elephants during the long Act II memory wipe-out portion of this
wonderful film???<br /><br />Apparently during filming, the crew just happened to come across the
annual Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus parade in NYC, and thought that an
impromptu shooting during this unscripted spectacle might lend a good
sort of trippiness to the non-linear memory/experience process.<br /><br />Of course, as most folks know around the world, elephants, those
lovable long-lived pachyderms, also are associated metaphorically as
having extremely long memories...&quot;Elephants never forget&quot; is the common
maxim. This belief has actually been studied &amp; supported so:<br /><br />http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1285532.stm<br /><br />...so, kudos to Michel Gondry, et crew, for &quot;Focus&quot;ing on the elephants
during this impromptu circus shoot. It would be interesting to find out
if the editors realized this neat metaphorical convergence
(elephants=memory), or if it was just just dumb-luck, realized post hoc
by Yours Truly (&amp;, I&#39;m sure, at least a few others).
