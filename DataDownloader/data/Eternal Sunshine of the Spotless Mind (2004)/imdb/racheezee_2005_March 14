i think that the universal message communicated through this film is
SUCH a profound truth. i mean, the idea that regardless of what
artificial barriers we put into place for ourselves, we are who we are.
an individual, as unique or quirky as one might be, still retains the
faults or weaknesses common to all of the human race. we are bound to
repeat ourselves...and in this instance to realize that nothing
(especially in love) is perfect, and acceptance and appreciation of one
another are key. this movie was exceptionally made, the acting was
superb (especially Jim Carey)and the story is beautiful. i loved it and
recommend it to everyone
