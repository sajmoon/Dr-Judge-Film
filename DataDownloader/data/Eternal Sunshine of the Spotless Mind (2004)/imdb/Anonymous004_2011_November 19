This was a fun unexpected ride of a movie. I had no clue where this was
going at first and the plot line uber original. I am so happy to see a
movie that doesn&#x27;t have the same 1,2,3 code that every other movie has.
I think studios need to replace the old story plots with massive
originality. And that is what this delivered. So Thank You for making a
cool off-beat love story that even a dude can dig. I like the bus drive
scene it was great and the surreal quality of their connections was fun
to watch. To have someone you fall in love with and then get a broken
heart is just human. What a concept to erase That memory. A strange,
familiar chemistry these two have and I really think it&#x27;s an awesome
flick.
