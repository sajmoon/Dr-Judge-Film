2004_November 4 
I have not been able to stop thinking about this movie since I saw it.
Although not perfect, the film is so gracefully and lovingly presented
that it more than makes up for any flaws. From the moment the film
began, I completely forgot it was Jim Carrey in the lead role. Whoever
would have thought that the flamboyant comic could play a withdrawn and
shy character with such pathos and sympathy? WAS that Jim Carrey? I
still don't believe it. And Winslet, also in a departure from her usual
characters, complements him perfectly. I won't say the chemistry
between them was perfect, because that word implies sexuality. Although
I bought these two as lovers, it was their emotional connection that
was so unbelievably perfect. In fact, I appreciated that there were no
gratuitous sex scenes between Joel and Clementine which, given the
premise, could have easily been included. While more appropriate in
this movie than in many others, given the plot, a full-blown sex scene
would have cheapened this film.<br /><br />I had some issues: I found the side plot with the technicians and
receptionist (interesting supporting roles for Kirsten Dunst and Elijah
Wood, both of whom perform quite well) rather tiresome and distracting.
I also was annoyed by the December-May romance, which was wholly
unbelievable although it served a purpose. In addition, I was skeptical
about these two totally different people being attracted to each other
in the first place -- but it is to the actors' credit that they made
such a seemingly incompatible couple come together (and fall apart) so
beautifully. Perhaps that was the point.<br /><br />Oddly enough, the moment that grabs me and keeps reliving in my memory
is the scene in which Clementine &quot;borrows&quot; a piece of Joel's chicken.
His reaction and their subsequent conversation is so poignant. It's
subtle and simple moments like these that make up good movie-making,
probably because they're the same ones that make up real life.
