Well first I'll start with Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. haha
This is Jim Carrey's second best film next to the Truman Show. He has
more talent than most actors these days, 'IN SERIOUS FILMS'. He can't
act in comedies, he is terribly over done and so boring especially in
'Bruce Almighty'. In this film he is so brilliant and very worthy of an
Oscar.<br /><br />The Oscars next year are going to be a very difficult choice, EG: JIM
CARREY = Eternal Sunshine of the SPOTLESS MIND, TOM CRUISE =
COLLATERAL, DENZELL WASHINGTON = THE MACHURIAN CANTIDATE and many more.
Anyway the story in this film is very complicated and arty. All the
photography and acting is just amazing and the sophisticated script is
BRILLIANT. I rate this film 10/10 and I recommend people who do not
understand ART not to see it as they would not appreciate it.<br /><br />PAUL.............
