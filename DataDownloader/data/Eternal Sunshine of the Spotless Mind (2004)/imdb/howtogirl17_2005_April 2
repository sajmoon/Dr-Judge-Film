This was a very unique film, different from every other movies I ever
watched. The story and its characters were extremely complex, but the
director presented it in a way that was clear and easy for everyone to
understand. <br /><br />The love and hate Clementine and Joel feel for each other was visually
portrayed through the movie when Clem decides to erase her memory of
Joel. As Joel discovers this fact and does the same thing out of spite,
the movie begins its story. The sequence is not always easy to see, but
it is not very confusing at all if you pay attention. Joel's memories
are repeated by flashbacks and current happenings at the same time. The
audience awaits with expectations as to how things will conclude
between Joel and Clem.<br /><br />Again, a most bizarre film, but great in all its contents. Excellent
for moviegoers who want to try a new genre.
