All I can say is that this is an unbelievable movie that is completely
unbelievable. Please watch this movie with an open mind(suspend
reality). Don't get got up in<br /><br />the &quot;means to an end&quot; part of this movie. Just realize that it is a
love story and it will overwhelm you. This movie will be remembered for
a long tome. Please<br /><br />support these type of movies, they're a dying breed that need to live
so the people that live in our time are not remembered as heartless
souls. Not a lot of<br /><br />people saw this movie at the theater so please support it by buying the
DVD or VHS tape. 9 out of 10.
