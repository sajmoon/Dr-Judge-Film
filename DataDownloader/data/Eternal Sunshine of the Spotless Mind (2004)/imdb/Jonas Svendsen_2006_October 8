I&#39;m glad to see Jim Carrey doing something that is serious. Not that
his other movies has been stupid, bad or not serious, i mean.<br /><br />He&#39;s a great comedian, he&#39;s a funny guy, but every movie that includes
him being crazy and out of his mind is always the same, the same faces,
sounds, gestures.<br /><br />It must have been challenging for him to play Joel Barrish, and he did
it really well, i was stunned at first. Kate Winslet is also great,
they&#39;re both great.<br /><br />this movies was great, probably on of the best 10 movies i&#39;ve ever seen
in my entire life.
