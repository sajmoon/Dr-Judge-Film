This movie is excellent in my humble opinion; It&#39;s that kind of movie
you can see over and over again, and always there&#39;s something new for
the eye, something that you didn&#39;t get before.<br /><br />The plot is really amazing and unexpected, and the whole mind game
stays with you for weeks. It&#39;s a little bit confusing at the beginning,
but half an hour into the movie things start to get explained and, by
the end, the whole movie fits like a glove.<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine is a deeply moving picture and a brilliantly executed
drama, without falling into clich&eacute;s. I think all the issues of
relationships are treated within the movie, and you will feel very
close to the characters.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film to anyone that has been ever into a
relationship that has ended for some reason.
