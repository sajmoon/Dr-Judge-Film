This is a movie about a couple, Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate
Winslet). Clementine decides she is unhappy and undergoes a procedure
where all her memories of Joel are erased from her mind. When Joel
finds out, he decides to undergo the same procedure. Another
masterpiece from Charlie Kaufman. Where Adaptation is about Charlie
himself and about a screenplay he is writing, this movie goes back to
the brain trek from Being John Malkovich. This movie makes commentary
on relationships, memories, reality, and the Pandora's box that is
technology and medicine. The overall theme that I perceived was most
relevant is that without memory or a recollection of the past we are
inevitably forced to repeat it (whether we realize it or not). Also
that painful, traumatic memories sometimes go hand in hand with the
happy memories. When one starts to erase the unhappy ones, so go the
happy ones. This is a great movie and I recommended it to everyone.
