For a high-concept setting, it's not a high-concept movie, and that's
what works so well about Eternal Sunshine. I found the film engaging,
immersive, and -- for a movie about memory erasure -- surprisingly
real. I'd imagine that even people who find they don't enjoy &quot;weird&quot;
movies might find a lot to relate to in Eternal Sunshine, as the movie
provokes a viewer's memories of the exhilaration of meeting someone for
the first time, and the pain they felt as the relationship
disintigrated.<br /><br />The screenplay provides a completely solid basis for the performances,
and casting Carrey and Winslet as the lead couple worked great. Who'd
have thunk it? Jim Carrey plays an introvert, while Winslet plays a
frumpy and moody girl on the edge... and it fits perfectly. I was
somewhat less enthusiastic about Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, and
Elijah Wood, but overall, they didn't get in the way too much.<br /><br />A fine movie, full of interesting visuals and compelling characters...
definitely worth a look.
