Charlie Kaufman has once again written a memorable, unique screenplay
that will have people leaving the theatre thinking, &quot;WTF?&quot; Joel Barish
(Jim Carrey, you may or may not remember him from &quot;Rubberface&quot; in 1983,
he hasn't really been doing much since, given his love for vacationing
in the jungles of Siberia) is a typical &quot;nice&quot; guy; he keeps to
himself, and, not unlike a giraffe, is fearful of human interaction. At
a party, he meets up with Clementine Kruczynski (newcomer Kate Winslet,
I think that we'll be seeing more from this young lady), who is vibrant
and full of energy, the &quot;yin&quot; to Joel's &quot;yang&quot; (God, that was the most
clich&eacute;d BS I've ever written).<br /><br />After a tumultuous relationship, Clementine decides, on a whim, to
erase her memories of Joel, an act which prompts him to do the same (if
you could really do that, I would erase my memories of seeing &quot;House of
1000 Corpses&quot;, as well as that time I saw my grandmother in leather hot
pants). Most of the movie takes place inside Joel's head during his
memory erasure, as he decides he doesn't really want to lose her, and
fights to remember.<br /><br />This movie is quirky, funny, intriguing, and brilliant. It might not be
the movie for everyone, but it's definitely worth mentioning.
