Charlie Kaufman has evolved as a screenwriter. Both Adaptation and
Being John Malkovich were great films, but they were the creation of a
confused writer. Kaufman had found a way to share his thoughts and be
universal at the same time with this film. Considering other Kaufman
scripts, Michel Gondry, the director, had made the most accessible
Kaufman movie yet. His unique cinematography and imagery style takes
the attention of audience on the story itself, rather than technical
wizardry. The story has many layers and as a wise choice leaves the
ending to the audience. Jim Carey plays it simple this time. Even in
Truman Show he had showed his skills in slap-stick underneath the calm
character of Truman. He plays an average guy whom you can relate to.
Kate Winslet shows why she is a gifted actress as she is showing the
warmth of Clementine beside her edgy side. This movie is brilliant and
a huge step in Kaufman's career.
