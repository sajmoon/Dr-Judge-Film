How refreshing to watch a film which doesn't assume its audience is
braindead. Outstanding script (although I'm onto your formula
Kaufman!), magical directing - not just great performances, but wrapped
up with brilliant special effects around time/memories/changing scenes.<br /><br />Quick time-out: if you're not familiar with Michel Gondry, you're in
for a treat. He's the visual genius behind music videos like Bjork's
Hyperballad &amp; Joga, Chemical Brothers' Star Guitar and Let Forever Be,
White Stripes' Fell In Love With A Girl, and many many more. You can
see them on a 'Directors' DVD, which I highly recommend - and where you
can see all the techniques (and more) which are used in Eternal
Sunshine.. It's best described as 'stage magic'; although most of it is
post-production, a lot of things are traditional tricks with
lighting/scenery/camera shots/stop-motion, and no obvious 'Attack of
the Clones' glossy CGI nonsense (although that's fun too). Michel
Gondry: write that name down!<br /><br />Jim Carrey &amp; Kate Winslet are both brilliant in these straight dramatic
roles, with good support from Frodo, Kirsten Dunst and others. I'm sure
there's an explanation somewhere of why comedians are so good at drama
(something to do with huge demands on stage material, internal pathos
etc.), and Carrey doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />You finish the film with enormous affection for the characters, and
find out why, in love (and life), the bad is as important as the good.
Which we should all know anyway, but it's nice to be reminded in such
an imaginative way. And there's nothing wrong with nice. Honestly.
