Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet star in this Charlie Kaufman-scripted love
story which overcomes its central device to elicit genuine emotion.<br /><br />Quiet straight arrow Joel (Carrey) has been dumped by wacky Clementine
(Winslet) and is hurt to learn she's opted for a new process to remove
all memories of him.<br /><br />Distraught, he jumps into the same procedure and has to endure the
heartache of losing her again, this time in reverse as he becomes a
bystander in his own memories.<br /><br />Along the way Joel discovers an unprofessional operative is attempting
to use inside knowledge to worm his way into Clem's affections and so
determines to interrupt the process and hide a few precious moments
with her.<br /><br />Although the plot mechanism is Kaufman's king, he doesn't subjugate the
human elements beneath its needs and crafts some poignantly tender
scenes.<br /><br />Carrey also impresses, showing there's far more to him than a looning
Jerry Lewis clone with a convincing portrayal of loss.
