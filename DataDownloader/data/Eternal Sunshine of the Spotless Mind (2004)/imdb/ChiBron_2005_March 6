I mostly enjoyed the movie, but not for the reasons most others seem to
have enjoyed it. I keep reading words like &quot;soulful&quot;,
&quot;touching&quot;,&quot;romantic&quot; and &quot;makes u think about ur own loved ones&quot;. I
just didn't get that feeling. I never felt emotionally attached to
Joel-Clementine's relationship. They really didn't strike me as
anything that special, but that did not ruin the movie for me. The
unique concept in which the story is told is worthy of ur time itself -
and really the biggest reason Y i liked it. The acting by both Winslet
and Carrey is superb. Technically, its brilliant as well. I would've
preferred a movie more emotionally engaging.....considering it's still
about two people in love.....but we never really get to know the
characters that well. The screenplay(some portions of Joel's memory)
could also have been better in the 2nd half. It did leave me looking at
the watch quite a few times.....and that's never a good sign. <br /><br />Overall, good, but not THAT good.
