This movie is so drastically different from many of the movies today.
It is a classic Love story with so many twists and tangles That you
feel as if you are actually a part of this crazy situation. Jim Carey
proves to be an amazing dramatic actor while Kate Winslet shines once
more. From the time the two chose to erase all memory of one another to
the heartfelt ending, The quirkiness of The characters as well as their
realistic experiences captures the audiences attention and manages to
hold it throughout the entire movie. The power that their love holds
makes anyone want to find a love as deep and meaningful as the love
they share. From the wacky hair colors to the Histeric memories, you
find yourself laughing and wondering whats to come, through out the
entire film. This is a must see movie for all of those who have
experienced the tragedies and pleasures of Love.
