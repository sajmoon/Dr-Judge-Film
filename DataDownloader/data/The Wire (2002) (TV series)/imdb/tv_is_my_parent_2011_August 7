Where can I start about The Wire? Should I first say this is a work of
art? or top three dramas on TV? or deserves to be seen more than once?<br /><br />But all of us first thank David Simon. Not a good citizen, ex-police,
or an average observer could create a masterpiece like The Wire.There
were times I laughed, saddened, surprised with the unforgettable
characters he created. He&#x27;s a genius, and we all know it.<br /><br />Also the excellent writers who are the foundations of this show. Never
gave us sloppy jobs or mediocre scenarios.<br /><br />Show couldn&#x27;t be this effective without the perfect actors who did
their best to portray their characters the best.<br /><br />At first I didn&#x27;t give The Wire more chance and I throw it away but I
re-watched the first season and then I was shocked to see how a golden
this show was. 10/10.
