The Wire just finished its latest season and this show has become a
remarkable thing. I had to write. In a time of great television (BSG,
Unit, Studio 60, Dexter) the Wire, which was on the bubble last season,
came back as the best of them all.<br /><br />This season was superlative, an extraordinary achievement. Not only was
it riveting and heartbreaking, it is easily the best show HBO has
produced (including Deadwood and I&#39;m a very big fan of Deadwood) and
ranks as one of the best television shows ever. The acting was amazing,
particularly this season by the &#39;kids.&#39; The show is about the lives of
the cops and drug dealers in Baltimore, how they intertwine and
interconnect. To say more would do it an injustice. This is great TV.<br /><br />If you don&#39;t know the show, you oughta. Go get the DVDs, look on HBO On
Demand, beg, borrow or steal episodes. Use your ipod video. I promise
you this, the show will captivate you. Amazing!
