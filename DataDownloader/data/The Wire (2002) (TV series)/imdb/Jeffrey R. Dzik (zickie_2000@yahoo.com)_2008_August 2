I can not express, in words, the quality of this show. It is so real
that I, at times, fail to realize these people are in front of a
camera. The script is so on key and the character actors, from a few
better known to all of the lesser known and unknown, are masterful in
their roles. While the 60 episodes over five seasons, seems to be a
reasonable length, for a show of this kind, as far as I am concerned,
it could have run forever. I had the opportunity of working in Newark,
NJ as a teenager in the 70&#39;s, in and around &quot;The Pit&quot;, a very similar
setting of low rise and high rise city housing projects. I met many of
the same people in my travels assisting a bread truck driver and got to
know some of them personally. Kudos, once again, to HBO on accepting
this production and delivering quality TV at its best. They are blowing
network TV to shame. All network TV is full of low quality sitcoms and
reality shows.
