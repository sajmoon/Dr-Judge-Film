I&#x27;ve seen a lot of series in the last few years, grew up seeing Hill
Street Blues, Dempsey&#x26;Makepeace and all kinds of other police series.
This one resurrected the theme for me. This Series takes the prize so
far. Story, characters, plot twists and turns all keep you engaged and
wanting more. Personally I ate the 5 seasons in about 2 weeks. The
policemen have flaws and qualities, a lot of ass-kissers turn out to be
decent human beings, a lot of heroes turn out to be scum, idealists
retire into politicians. Don&#x27;t miss the series, I assure you if you try
season 1 you will see season 5. I loved seeing this series. All 5
seasons are excellent and worth watching.
