Alright, The Wire isn&#39;t about Baltimore. Those of you who are fans know
what I&#39;m talking about. True, Baltimore is the backdrop, but The Wire
is more about the socio-economic state of our country as it is today.
Take a look at your current surroundings and you&#39;ll understand.
Everywhere there is an example of unfulfilled promises and the wreckage
that was left in the wake of them. The Wire works because it is at it&#39;s
heart and soul a cop show that takes a long, hard look at reality. The
Writers do not pull punches. The great thing about this show though is
the fact that while they show the seedy underbelly of Baltimore, they
also show the great side of it. True, back in the day Baltimore was
dirty, but now there has been a great revival. You can see it in
neighborhoods like Fells Point, Canton and Federal Hill. There are
great bars, restaurants and great shops all over the city. I&#39;m not just
talking to hear the sound of my own voice here. I grew up in DC and we
always viewed Baltimore as the ugly little sibling that we didn&#39;t want
anything to do with. However, my opinion has been changed.<br /><br />Cheers.
