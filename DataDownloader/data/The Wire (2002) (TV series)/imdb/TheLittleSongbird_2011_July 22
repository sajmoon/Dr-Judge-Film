I have seen many brilliant shows, and The Wire is one of them. Even the
word brilliant isn&#x27;t enough to put into words how good this series is.
The Wire is incredibly well made, with moody lighting, striking
location work that also brings atmosphere and great photography, while
the music is very haunting. The Wire with its thoughtful and tense
dialogue also has some of the best writing of any show I&#x27;ve seen, the
stories are ceaselessly compelling and the characters are rich and
unforgettable. All the episodes are superbly directed, and very rarely
do you feel cheated at the end of episodes. The acting is superb,
Dominic West and Idris Elba are especially brilliant. In conclusion,
phenomenal. 10/10 Bethany Cox
