This terrific show should be carefully watched by budding screen writers
and
directors. It's worth noting that without exception all of the
performances
have been terrific. Why haven't more of these fine character actors been
seen more?<br /><br />ALthough much has been made of the homicide connection, I think the wire
is
actually far superior because it sticks resolutely to a very believable
central plotline, and is cast with realistic looking characters.<br /><br />I hope we can look forward to another season of this series. It alone is
worth the money I spend for HBO each month.
