In the beginning,<br /><br />David Simon was a writer for the Baltimore Sun. Teaming up with Ed
Burns who used to be on the police force, Simon developed a handful of
characters based on stories and people he wrote about. Together he and
Burns designed what is perhaps the smartest piece of television in
history along side the Simpsons<br /><br />The Wire is all about the drug wars going on in the roughest part of
Baltimore, and what goes down on either side of the law. What makes the
show so special is the way it is presented in an objective unbiased
way. When the media or network drama show crime in the world, the
material is always dumbed down or dichotomized, meaning broken down
into a two sided issue (good vs. bad). The Wire does not do this, it
shows the big picture. For example, there are frequent times when some
of the criminals are likable, and the cops are not. There are no easy
heroes, or villains, there are no clich&#xE9;s or gimmicks, and there is no
illusion to what we see. It is real. <br /><br />In season one, a mismatched handful of police officers from two
departments (homicide and major crimes) are brought together to become
a special unit with one objective. They are to monitor the drug
criminals using a wiretap until they have enough evidence to bring down
the operation. It is harder than it sounds, way harder. The smartest of
these cops is Detective James McNulty, an eager, sharp-thinking cop,
who leads a wreck of a life, (part of which has to do which his
drinking problem). His team is also dedicated and hard working, but in
the police department, the chain of command makes it hard for them to
do their job. Sitting in the big chairs are people who are more
interested in their jobs and good publicity rather than running
expensive slow operations like wiretapping drug drug lords, which
doesn&#x27;t result in frequent arrests.<br /><br />On the other side of the law, the head honchos are ruffians who are
only interested in business, but the pawns in that game (the ones who
sell the drugs on street corners) are in a very disturbing and
sympathetic situation. A lot of them are just kid, youngsters who say
no to an education. Some of the ones we meet are only grade school
aged! They do drug dealing to make money which barely keeps them
surviving in the harsh world they live in.<br /><br />The complexity and grittiness and anger of the show has resulted in a
lack of commercial success, but anyone who likes good television, will
not only love The Wire, they will praise it. There is a world here that
most of us will never understand unless we watch.
