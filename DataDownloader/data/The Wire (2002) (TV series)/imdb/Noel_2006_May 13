The Wire is easily one , if not the best written for TV programme The
story lines are character driven the acting almost unnaturally natural
and in a world where bubble gum TV rules the airwaves Its a show
entirely aimed at a mature thinking audience.<br /><br />I take my hat off to all those involved in the show and its gives a
clear indication that ratings can not always be used as yard-stick.
Every now again you have to be brave, stand up and be counted.<br /><br />If you have never seen the Wire , I envy you. Get the DVDs and watch it
for yourself you wont be disappointed<br /><br />Noel
