Some things baffle me, like: &quot;the flat earth society&quot;, someone who can
watch any reality TV show habitually, and the popularity of &quot;pet rocks&quot;
in the 1980s. But more than any of those is the publics&#39; lack of
attention for &quot;The Wire&quot;. After watching the first season (all in one
sitting) I thought that the people responsible for the Emmys and the
Golden Globes were going to have to create more award categories just
to accommodate this shows amazing depth of talent. I was expecting a
dump truck to roll out on stage and say: &quot;THERE!! thanks for
monopolizing the awards you over achieving %$#%s&quot;. I have never in my
life seen anything as engaging on a television. There were characters
in the series I will remember as vividly as I do Al Pacino and Marlon
Brando in the &quot;The Godfather&quot; for the rest of my life. I know you may
think that&#39;s a bit of an overstatement, but the writing and the acting
truly was extraordinary! The cast and the crew of &quot;The Wire&quot; have
undoubtedly created one of, if not &quot;the&quot;, best programs ever to be
broadcast on a T.V.
