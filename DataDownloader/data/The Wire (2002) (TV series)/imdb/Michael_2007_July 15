I, unlike many here, wasn&#39;t hooked from the first episode. I watched
the first few episodes and was unimpressed enough to wait another year
before watching the remaining episodes.<br /><br />The police use the wire to obtain a view of the inner workings of a
drug association. With it, they are able to obtain a detailed picture
of their discipline, cautiousness, and strict organization. The police
are frequently impressed by these uneducated drug dealers, and are
required to spend an extraordinary time trying to piece together the
puzzles of murders, drug shipments, money and property.<br /><br />The audience uses The Wire to get a detailed view into the inner
workings of political process, unions, police management. The devious
brilliance of how these organizations use politics and leverage to
undermine legitimate efforts to actually reduce crime, and how &quot;rogue
police&quot; are those people who are entirely committed to bringing down
real criminals for real crimes instead of simply making mass arrests of
loiterers and junkies.<br /><br />The astute audience member will recognize that he is also part of a
organization that compromises its people, and whether we&#39;re at the top
of the food chain or far down at the bottom we&#39;ll end up making choices
that are not really ours and compromises that we may yet live to
regret.
