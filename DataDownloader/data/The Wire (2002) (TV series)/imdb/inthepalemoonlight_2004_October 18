Hate to be rude but don't pay attention to the moronic post below. That
was some of the most lame criticism I have ever come across on this
site. I doubt the guy even watched the entire first season. This show
is the best thing going on TV. Writing. Direction. Acting. Its all
perfection. The people behind the show are former journalists and
police officers who were covering crime in Baltimore or working the
beat as cops for over 20 years. They know what they speak of and don't
rely on cookie cutter characterization. This is the closest thing to a
novel that you will find on TV. It is so impeccably plotted and so
honest and realistic that I will never be able to watch another cop
show (or any TV drama) without comparing it to this example of
television greatness. Did I mention its also the smartest TV show on
the air too? The Sopranos gets the media attention but it can't match
the sophistication and grittiness of The Wire. The Sopranos is a
romanticized TV crime drama by comparison. And as for Six Feet Under?
Please! It reached its peak in its final six episodes of the first
season and haven't lived up to that magic since. It doesn't get any
better than The Wire. Universal critical acclaim. The winner of the
2002 TV Critics awards. The winner of the 2004 Peabody award. Nuff
said.
