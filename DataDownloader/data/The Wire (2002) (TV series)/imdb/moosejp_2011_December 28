Within these 60 hours you will not only witness the demise of the
American dream but us as a whole. Self interest,greed, lack of us
working as a real collective (unless it serves the self interest). I
could go on about what has been achieved with this masterpiece. But you
must watch and judge for yourself. If i had to make a time capsule that
sums up this moment in time The Wire would be the first thing in it.
How many of you who have watched this would agree with me??<br /><br />The Beauty of the wire is that the time allows us to build the
characters up and David Simon achieves this with great love and
affection towards all his characters<br /><br />CHARACTER SPOILER ALERT We love Bubbles a man of our ages struggling
with his own demons, the futility of his own existence makes us
question whats it all about??<br /><br />Omar a modern day robin hood, a Homosexual Black man who is arguably
the meanest man in the hood and certainly has balls of steel, as his
enemies reluctance to go to war with him speaks volumes about the man<br /><br />Mcnulty a complete f--k up of a man in real life but &#x22;Natural Police&#x22;
to quote the lovable??Jay Landsman.<br /><br />Freamon a real detective a man of great detail who has been cast out
for many years just like life does with the real talent,FFS he should
be running the show.<br /><br />We hate Rawls a complete ---- of a man only interested in the self. <br /><br />We Love and Hate<br /><br />Clay Davies a corrupt man with a tongue so smooth it makes silk seem
sandpaperish(if thats a word)<br /><br />Anyway watch and judge for yourself i just cant imagine how this will
ever be equalled never mind surpassed.
