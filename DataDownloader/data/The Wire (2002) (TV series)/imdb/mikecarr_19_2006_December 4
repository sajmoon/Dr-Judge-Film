This may well be the best series I have ever seen. Ever. (Can only
speak for seasons 1 and 4. Eagerly anticipating seasons 2,3, and the
upcoming 5.) <br /><br />Even if you aren&#39;t wild about cop shows, the acting, cinematography and
writing are too good to miss. I am about as far as it gets from a cop
show junkie, managing to miss (or sample and pass on) everything since
Hill Street Blues.<br /><br />I like the Sopranos and this is far better. Better than Deadwood. Maybe
better than Band of Brothers. Certainly comparable. You will not be
disappointed.
