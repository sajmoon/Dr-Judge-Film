the Wire really is the best show on TV. This week, Golden Globe
nominations came out, and the Wire didn&#39;t receive one. I cannot
understand how this show can continue to be ignored. Every single actor
on this show is incredible. The four young men from this season all
deserve an award!!! The cops, the &quot;bad&quot; guys, and poor Bubbles,
everyone has an effect on you - whether you hate them or love them. The
story lines are complex and compelling. This is the kind of show that
you don&#39;t forget about once it&#39;s over! I hate that i have to wait
another year for a new season, but I will be watching season 1-4 all
over again. <br /><br />Let&#39;s do whatever we can to make sure this show does not get overlooked
when the Emmy nominations roll out. I know it has been said that this
is a show that is difficult to watch due to it&#39;s content, but so is the
Sopranos. What is so different? I hope it doesn&#39;t have to do with race,
but I have a feeling it does. If the movie/TV industry really wants to
show that they embrace diversity, please don&#39;t ignore this show again.
