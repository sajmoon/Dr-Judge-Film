It has been three years since the culmination of this HBO giant and
only now have I been able to appreciate The Wire in its entirety.<br /><br />I have spent the last three weeks surrounded by empty pizza boxes and
pepsi cans; routed to the same spot like a paraplegic glutton. For this
extended bout of inactivity I don&#x27;t blame myself. Nor do I blame the
addictive (and expensive) pizza habit I have inherited. I don&#x27;t even
blame society. Only The Wire has kept me glued to my position like a
sniper perched on a Kabul rooftop.<br /><br />From the inception, the sheer quality of everything blew me away. I was
suddenly excited and knew that what I was about to experience was extra
special. As a veteran watcher of recently great shows (The Sopranos/Six
Feet Under/The West Wing/Game of Thrones/Boardwalk Empire/Arrested
Development/Dexter/Breaking Bad to name a few) my expectations would
take some beating. After all, I had witnessed the unnerving fate of
Tony Soprano in The Sopranos, the untimely death of Nathanial Fisher in
Six Feet Under, the end of an era in The West Wing or the Bluthe Finale
in Arrested Development; there have been some notable television
experiences. Why should this be any different? And then came the first
episode.<br /><br />A drama from the perspective of all sides in Baltimore&#x27;s continuous
drug wars, the series portrays the everyday lives of those it harbours.
From Councilmen to crack-addicts, soldiers to servicemen and drug
dealers to drug releivers. The intertwining relationships between each
facet of this world is simply fascinating. And I would bet that such a
true and perfect portrayal of a problem that effects so many can be
bettered than by that in The Wire.<br /><br />The dialogue has a realism that I have yet to see in a drama. The
acting is emmy winning all round, with stand out performances from
near-all of the cast. The plots and sub-plots are dynamic,
unpredictable and exciting. The level of suspense and grit are
unrivalled in television. The production and location is also brilliant
- the world of Baltimore is portrayed in a creatively perfect way so
that anybody could imagine the atrocities that occurs in this town. The
characters are multi-layered. Bad guys can be good, good guys can be
bad and everybody has a number of sides that will never truly be
discovered. The casting is immaculate. Not one character could be
improved or cast better. And as for the direction - the sheer
addictiveness of the show renders this argument useless.<br /><br />All areas are to a level of near perfection and without waxing lyrical,
there is not a show like this on TV. To all those who suspect this of
being &#x27;another cop show&#x27;, you are heavily mistaken. This drama brings
so much more than any standard &#x27;cop show&#x27; in TV history. If you are
willing to be thrilled, entertained, challenged and touched - please
watch The Wire. It is as close to the ultimate television drama as you
could possibly get.<br /><br />Finally, a BIG round of applause to HBO. Time and time again they
strike gold; finding the very best in writing and producing it to a
standard that rivals film. The network has never ceased to amaze me and
should be held in the highest possible esteem - a beacon for all other
television networks to aspire to. Thank you, HBO!
