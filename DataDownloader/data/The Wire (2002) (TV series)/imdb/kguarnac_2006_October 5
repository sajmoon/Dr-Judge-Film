The Wire is the best series on TV . The writing is superbly realistic
and draws the viewer immediately in to the lives of the characters. The
episodes mirror issues that affect US cities today. The actors have
developed their characters into believable, real people. To me, this
series beats anything The Sopranos has ever put out. If you can&#39;t get
enough of The Wire, watch The Corner, also by the same writers. The
Corner is based on a true story, in the streets of Baltimore. You can
see the natural development of some characters into roles on The Wire.
I watch every new episode on HBO OnDemand on Monday morning, with a
review every now and then.
