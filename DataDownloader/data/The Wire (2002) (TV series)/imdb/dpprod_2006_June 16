Not coincidentally brought to you by Clark Johnson, who both played
Detective Lewis in the best cop show ever (Homicide), and also brought
you &quot;The Shield&quot; on FX, another solid show. The Wire, like other HBO
productions, is a little more gritty and down to earth than network
shows. While I&#39;m a &quot;24&quot; addict without apology, I do like less over the
top fare on occasion. The Wire has realistic dialogue, excellent actors
(at least as far as cop shows go), and the writing so far is real good.
Worth a look if you like realistic crime/cop dramas. Lots of
interesting characters. The Lead actor in the show is Det. Jimmy
McNulty played by Dominic West. He is really good in this role, a very
reserved and understated performance for a lead role. Unlike Jack Bauer
in 24 or Detective Vic Mackey in The Shield, McNulty&#39;s character seems
to internalize more, less outward aggression than is usually on display
by our favorite lead cops. He plays the role with his eyes more often
than not. I&#39;m only into season one on DVD, I usually like watching
shows a year or two after they debut, no commercials and all. Here&#39;s
hoping this show doesn&#39;t drop off after the first season. HBO&#39;s second
fiddle to The Sopranos is well worth your time.
