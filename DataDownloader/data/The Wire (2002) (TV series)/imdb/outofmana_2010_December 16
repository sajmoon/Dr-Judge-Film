HBO is an absolute juggernaut of top notch caliber shows. After
watching all of the &#x22;great&#x22; shows (The Wire, Sopranos, Entourage,
Deadwood, Dexter, etc) I feel The Wire and Deadwood are the two
greatest ever created.<br /><br />The Wire is an amazingly accurate look into the good guys and bad guys
that inhabit Baltimore Maryland. This scenario could be applied to any
medium-large city in the United States as well.... New York,
Philadelphia, Los Angeles, etc. There are a few things that The Wire
does to transcend the norm for television shows to create a more
realistic ambiance. For example, two of the characters that I&#x27;m aware
of are actually from Baltimore, and lived a similar life compared to
the one their character portrays. Felicia &#x22;Snoop&#x22; Pearson has lived in
Baltimore all her life and plays a character of the same name. Snoop
portrays a female gangster in the drug game which, as she explained, is
not a far cry from her day to day life before doing the show. Sergeant
Jay Landsman from the real Baltimore PD was hired to play &#x22;Gary
D&#x27;Addario&#x22; on the show, and they also named a different character from
the show &#x22;Jay Landsman&#x22;.<br /><br />The Wire is a show that seems to have significantly more characters
(excluding extras) than most other shows, and in my mind every single
one is perfectly cast. The locations and wonderful shots of both the
good and the ugly locations in Baltimore give it both a gritty and
realistic feel. Finally, the dialogue/script for The Wire is perfect,
and can only (in my opinion) be rivaled by Deadwood. 10/10
