Unlike so many law enforcement programs The Wire depicts an
uncompromising and unvarnished vision of the Baltimore drug epidemic
and while this premise may sound all too familiar, The Wire&#39;s often
bleak and authentic nature develops the series to a level of
virtuosity. The Wire also has a unique status in the sense that you
identify with both the law and the street. Along side with examining
the city of Baltimore, The Wire makes a bold statement by reflecting on
the current morale and ambiguity that drugs generate in American
society. In addition to this each season focuses on a different agenda,
season 1 detailed the reaction of both law enforcement and drug
dealers, season 2 characterized various Baltimore citizens while
simultaneously depicting the plight of blue collar workers on the
docks, season 3 is quite similar to the 1st also slightly detailing the
corruption of politics, season 4 strictly draws it&#39;s attention to the
education system with heart rendering results. The Wire encumbers all
aspects of viewing whether you want to watch it out of pure curiosity,
entertainment, information or other wise.
