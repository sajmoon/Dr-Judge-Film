I&#x27;m sorry in advance for my bad English, but since I am Greek and I
wanted to point out this TV series, this is the best I can do. I
strongly believe this is one of the best TV work ever... I find the
actor roles to be highly realistic and the whole TV Show tends to send
a message to the viewer that is both sad and tends to &#x22;puzzle&#x22; him
about today&#x27;s corruption, as far as drugs, police, politics and
education are concerned. One of the things I love about it is that it
displays Baltimore&#x27;s world through the eyes of everybody, including
cops, teachers, politics and common citizens, in which case it gives
you the opportunity to form a more spherical opinion. You&#x27;ll soon find
yourself bonded to several characters and I think you may learn some
things for yourself... At least I now look at the world from a
different angle...
