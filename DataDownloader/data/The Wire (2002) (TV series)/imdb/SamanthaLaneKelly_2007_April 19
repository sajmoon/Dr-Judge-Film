I didn&#39;t know my TV could do this . . .<br /><br />It&#39;s the greatest TV drama series I&#39;ve ever seen. Better by some
distance than even its notable HBO peers. (I call it a TV drama but the
fact is that it&#39;s suited purely for DVD, it has complete disregard for
the casual viewer and is perhaps best viewed in two or three sittings,
a minor detail in episode three will find its significance ten episodes
later, etc).<br /><br />Focusing on the drugs business of Baltimore (and so much more) from the
police to the dealers to City Hall to the longshoremen on the coast, I
simply cannot rave about this show enough and have become a bore on the
subject. <br /><br />The profane writing snaps and pops beautifully, the plots are deeply
intricate and profoundly gripping, and the acting is nothing short of
perfection. What a cast! I don&#39;t say this lightly. The characters run
deep and authentic with performances to match, and there are no minor
characters in this show, some simply have more screen time than others.<br /><br />After the terrific first season I couldn&#39;t believe that the shattering
second series (perhaps the high-water mark) not only kept up the
standard, but perhaps even exceeded it. The third, fourth and fifth
seasons stand shoulder to shoulder too, joining finally and standing as
a single tapestry. <br /><br />This is heavy-duty and literary storytelling of the first order.<br /><br />The show requires attention and commitment and will reward both to a
degree that means when each &quot;case&quot; ends you&#39;ll be edified in a way that
the CSI franchise et al can never even fractionally compete with. <br /><br />They are pizza, The Wire is a banquet. We don&#39;t get enough banquets, so
accept this ones invitation, you wont regret it.<br /><br />Heartbreaking, somehow funnier than many comedies, beautifully played
and written with enviable brilliance, if you&#39;re unaware of this show
then I urge you: invest, it&#39;s likely you&#39;ll thank me later. Get season
one and sit back, prepare to find yourself in the thrall of genuine yet
disarmingly humble greatness. <br /><br />Be warned though, don&#39;t expect episodic entertainment, these are 12 and
13 hour procedural movies that add up to a five-year whole, divided by
necessity by HBO, a network with the balls to have greenlit this series
five times, even despite its low ratings, simply on the basis of the
fact it&#39;s going to enter the pantheon of all time greatest.<br /><br />A little hyperbole there, but it&#39;s really above and beyond.<br /><br />So many classic moments, each growing more rich with time, to say more
about them or name the moments would spoil the experience of seeing
them fresh, as I did and as I would heartily recommend -- avoid
spoilers (not that the text on screen will do justice to this cast,
this writing and production), you&#39;ll be rewarded by the story. It has
moments that truly compete with the best in cinema whilst
simultaneously cutting its own fierce path.<br /><br />It&#39;s rare for me to enthuse about something to this degree (and in
years of using the IMDb this is the only comment I&#39;ve taken the time to
make), but somewhere in its fusion of casually classic writing and
disarmingly humble production -- they made my favourite thing. <br /><br />The Wire is simply an astonishing achievement. I owned the first season
on DVD for about a year before I realised it was astonishing -- it
crept up on me, my brain had to catch up with it -- when I rewatched it
and got the other seasons, I became (and remain) utterly hooked.<br /><br />Do youself a favour, if you haven&#39;t already -- check out The Wire.
