The Wire is like no other show I&#39;ve seen. It doesn&#39;t take you by the
hand and simplify its themes and characters for the sake of
entertainment value. It instead weaves a tapestry little by little,
such that you might not make sense of it at first, but when more of the
thing is done, you step back in awe at the craftsmanship at work.<br /><br />The show finds poetry and philosophy from the least likely of places- a
drug dealer running a pit or a crooked dock worker, but until the fifth
season, it never rings false. The Wire is funnier than most shows,
simply because the humor comes directly from the characters and
situations, from perceptions that often ring out with absurd or bitter
truth.<br /><br />To top it all off, after the initial warm-up investment of 2-4
episodes, the show becomes as entertaining as anything else I&#39;ve seen
and as addictive as da yellow tops dey be slingin&#39; down on dem corners,
yo.
