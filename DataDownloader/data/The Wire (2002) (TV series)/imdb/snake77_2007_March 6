The best thing ever made for television, and really more complex and
entertaining than all but a handful of movies as well. It&#39;s hard to
know where to begin to praise this series - there really hasn&#39;t been
anything like it before. Imagine if your all-time favorite movie, with
the most compelling characters and interesting story, could go on for
another 48 hours and only get better and you start to get the idea.
When it starts you think it&#39;s going to a standard tale of noble cops
versus sinister bad guys, but that&#39;s only the surface and you are about
to see so much more. <br /><br />A &quot;wire&quot; is police shorthand for a wiretap &#150; a way to observe and
record people without their knowledge. Soon you realize this is also a
metaphor for the show itself &#150; you as the viewer are getting a chance
to be a hidden observer into the workings of a modern American city at
all its levels, from the streets to the corridors of power. It&#39;s really
like a televised novel - a realistic, complex exploration of the
characters and the world they inhabit. As episodes build the hidden web
of interdependence between the people and institutions from the lowest
to the highest levels in the city of Baltimore is vividly brought to
life. And as in life, the quick conclusion you make after seeing the
surface of a person or institution is often revealed to be a completely
different truth when you start peeling back the layers.<br /><br />The people who write the Wire seem to be determined to pull no punches.
Realistic violence, sex, and language are a main theme of this show and
will no doubt turn off some potential viewers. But the beauty of The
Wire is that all of these things are put in context due to the length
(five seasons) of the series, and they are never gratuitous. Actions
both large and small are shown to have consequences - sometimes far
down the line, sometimes far beyond what was intended. <br /><br />For me one of the most outstanding aspects of this series has to do
with race. The Wire manages to make race both the focal point and just
a starting point for the story at the same time. Although racial
realities are never avoided and hang as an omnipresent backdrop just as
they do in real life, as the series progresses the hugely diverse cast
proceeds to lay glorious waste to many of the stale, narrow stereotypes
Hollywood has been selling us for all these years. For this alone The
Wire is far ahead of its time.<br /><br />Nothing this epic or comprehensive could have been so amazingly well
done with out superb efforts from everyone involved, and they are more
than up to the task. Every member of the cast seems destined to play
their role - McNulty, Bunk, Lester, Greggs, Omar, Prez, Bunny,
Stringer, Avon, Bubbles, Bodie - there are too many great performances
to pick a favorite. Superb writing, terrific direction, real sets,
everything top notch. Despite being little-seen by mainstream TV
audiences and being nearly ignored by the Emmys, this series will one
day get the credit it deserves as a towering achievement and a true
ground breaker.
