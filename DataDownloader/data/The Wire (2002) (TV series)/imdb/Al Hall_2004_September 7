You want to learn something about city politics, police corruption,
drug dealing or how this tapestry of city corruption is woven together
then watch The Wire. This is truly an excellent series, with superb
acting, writing, directing, and truly outstanding characters.<br /><br />With season three starting Sept 18th I can wait. First season was drugs
in The Projects, second season was down on the Baltimore docks, with
longshoreman, drugs, prostitution, unions, and every changing need for
dock workers and space for condominiums and all the politics that go
in-between.<br /><br />This is a must see and makes HBO my #1 channel to watch. BTW, my
favorite character is Omar (Michael K. Williams). Omar is kind of a
modern day Robinhood. Steels from the drug dealers and gives to himself
and his crew. This guy redefines cool. 10/10
