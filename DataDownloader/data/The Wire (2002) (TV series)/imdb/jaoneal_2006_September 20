I don&#39;t subscribe to HBO. A couple of weeks ago I heard an interview
with a young actor from this series on NPR. It was described as a
&quot;gritty crime drama&quot; with many Baltimore locals portraying variations
on themselves. The interview made it sound interesting enough that I
decided to check out the first season on DVD.<br /><br />After the first few episodes I became seriously hooked and devoted 36
hours of the next ten days to the show.<br /><br />Having now watched the first 3 seasons, I believe it to be the best
television series I have seen.<br /><br />I do not understand why this show hasn&#39;t generated the buzz or the
awards of HBO&#39;s other series, such as the Sopranos or Deadwood. It is
more gripping, faster paced, and more intelligent. The other shows can
be a bit plodding, with plot lines that go nowhere, and a few
characters I don&#39;t much care about. That wasn&#39;t the case here.<br /><br />The show is a cross between the Sopranos and the old NBC show Homicide:
Life on the Street. The crime/sopranos side and the law/Homicide side
run in parallel. Individually, the parallel plot lines are compelling.
In tandem, they are complimentary and brilliant.<br /><br />There is no way to avoid having &quot;the best show ever&quot; tag sound like
anything but silly hype--regardless, what makes this show substantially
better than any other realistic and compelling crime or police drama is
the fact it is... searching. It doesn&#39;t just delve into the individual
psychologies motivating these people (ala the Sopranos) or the complex
interactions amongst the members of a community (ala Deadwood) it asks
&quot;what the hell can be done for all of these people&quot; and points out the
problems with any and all of the answers.<br /><br />It&#39;s truly brilliant. If you like intelligent television, I envy the
enjoyment you will have watching this for the first time.
