2010_December 15 
Much has already been said about this show. I have seen the whole
series about six times now, and I have to say it is the best I&#x27;ve seen.
I hesitated to rate it higher than Firefly, so I didn&#x27;t. Firefly is the
best entertainment there is to be had, but The Wire is the best show
ever made. I say that because The Wire seems like it was conceived from
beginning to end, for a full seven seasons, and that is EXTREMELY hard
to do. I think it was possible only because the writers never
over-reached, and always kept it within the realm of possibility, and
actually close to what is really happening. That&#x27;s not to say that Joss
Whedon wouldn&#x27;t have kept things plausible with Firefly for more than
one season, but he was never given the chance. The other shows that
have done it right: &#x22;Deadwood&#x22;, &#x22;Rome&#x22; - and that&#x27;s about it for now. I
love &#x22;Boardwalk&#x22; and &#x22;Dexter&#x22; and &#x22;Breaking Bad&#x22; - but they don&#x27;t quite
have the grit of &#x22;Deadwood&#x22; or the gravitas of &#x22;Rome&#x22; or the insight
and humanity of &#x22;The Wire&#x22; yet. I hope that HBO or Showtime or someone
has the guts to make a show to succeed The Wire. I really do. But for
now, it stands as the best show ever made - in my opinion. If Firefly
had gone on longer, it might have been a two horse race.
