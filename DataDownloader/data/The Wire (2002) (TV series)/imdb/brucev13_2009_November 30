The first time I heard of &#x22;The Wire&#x22; was on some forum discussing TV
shows. After checking out some clips on Youtube I wasn&#x27;t all that
impressed. With nothing left to watch I decided to give it a go. And I
must admit that this show is very rewarding on many different aspects
even if it can be relentless and it doesn&#x27;t hold back one bit. Don&#x27;t
expect any mercy from this show. And I mean none since most of what you
see happening to these people on the screen is true to life (at least
the core of it). You will learn to appreciate the characters even if
they aren&#x27;t really likable. And here lies the strength of the show.
There is a wonderful story present but is not something you haven&#x27;t
seen before. The attention to detail however is. This show has a depth
that is not present in other crime dramas. &#x22;The Wire&#x22; shows all the
sides and aspects involved in (mainly) drug trafficking. We will follow
the police,the criminals,the politicians and the victims of the drug
trade. While the overall tone of the show is meant to be serious and
educational,it doesn&#x27;t mean that there is no room for entertainment. I
can&#x27;t remember another serious crime drama where I laughed so hard as I
did with this show. &#x22;The Wire&#x22; is filled with the most funniest scenes
you will ever see. And considering the context you will not see these
jokes coming. It has been a while now that I have seen this show and I
still think about it. If that isn&#x27;t a sign of a true classic than what
is.
