I can&#x27;t really review this series because I&#x27;m currently viewing it for
the first time on DVD, and am in the middle of the 3rd season. I had
always heard how great it was and I have to say that, so far, it&#x27;s all
that! <br /><br />I made the mistake of re-watching an episode in the 2nd season to
listen to the commentary by Dominic West and the actor that plays Omar,
and boy, was I shocked when I heard West&#x27;s British accent. I thought it
was a put-on until I read his bio on IMDb, and frankly, it almost
ruined the series for me until I got over it and appreciated the
amazing character and all-American accent that he created. Still it&#x27;s
hard to believe when I hear McNulty speak.<br /><br />Next I found out that Idris Elba is also British. His portrayal of
Stringer Bell, so pitch perfect like most of the characters and actors
involved with this production, is even more laudable from an English
actor. Ripping job, lads!
