Possibly the best thing written for television ever; certainly the best
to come out in the last 25 or so years.<br /><br />&quot;The Wire&quot; escapes the melodramatic pitfalls of shows like &quot;the West
Wing,&quot; &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; and even &quot;The Sopranos&quot; (which are all smartly
written--or rather have had their moments of greatness).<br /><br />Here is a show which over the course of 37 hours weaves together scores
of very tautly detailed characters. It's not easy to watch--and its
certainly challenging. But it is surely worth it.<br /><br />The story unfolds in Baltimore and is a study on the effect of
institutions on its members: police, politicians, criminals, addicts.<br /><br />Some may find the show didactic. This is understandable because its
creators make heavy usage of allegory (for instance, seasons three's
not-so-subtle criticism of the situation in Iraq).<br /><br />Didactic or not, the show forces its viewers to think about and
hopefully start a larger discussion of the issues it touches upon: the
failure of the drug war, the gradual extinction of the American worker
and the dangers of a presumptive, preemptive war.<br /><br />Hats off to creators David Simon and Ed Burns (a retired BPD detective)
for creating one of the most interesting, daring shows in the history
of television.<br /><br />Let's hope HBO renews it for another 26 episodes.
