Best Police TV Series by a mile. It leaves NYPD Blue, Law and Order etc
in its wake. Remarkably realistic story lines coupled with great actors
makes this series a must see.<br /><br />Its a story told from the perspective of both the good guys as well as
the bad guys, however the lines separating the two sometimes become
very hazy indeed.<br /><br />A true gem from HBO, cant wait for season 4 (which i hear will be
coming out later in 2006. The one thing that captivated me is the
street lingo that just flows like a good rap song.<br /><br />Some characters truly captivate you. If you have some time check out
the HBO website for a fantastic organisation chart on both the street
and the cops.
