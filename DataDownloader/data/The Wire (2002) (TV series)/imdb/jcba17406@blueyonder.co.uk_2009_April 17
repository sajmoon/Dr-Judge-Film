The first season of The Wire finished yesterday on BBC2. It has been
hailed as the best cop series ever. I had seen it in the listings but
never bothered to watch because there are so many American cop shows
and rarely any impress me. When the Beeb took it up and I had read how
well it had been received I watched. From episode one I was grabbed. Of
the 13 episodes I forgot to record only two. It deserves all the
accolades.<br /><br />I checked out the show on the Internet Movie Data Base and was
surprised to learn that the series started in 2002 and ran for six
seasons until 2008. Why did it take so long for one of our mainstream
TV channels to broadcast it? And why, once bought, was it programmed
after 11pm? It beats the pants off our cop shows like The Bill. One
reason could be because it shows the cops and the robbers as both
corrupt and devout. And we can&#x27;t have the good old British public
considering the thought that the police can be as corrupt as the bad
guys, and for heaven sake, our governmental establishment! The Wire
successfully portrays both as human and therefore as likely to be bad
as well as good. Notwithstanding the fact that our police force has
been caught with their fingers in the till, as well as our
establishment figures such as MP&#x27;s and Royals, many times, our
mainstream media are bent attempting to keep the public in a fog of
illusion. The reasons are complex, yet come to one thing - stability.<br /><br />The theory is that if a country is stable it able to be civilized. The
problem is a stable country affords those in power to remain in power.
The UK has a well established social hierarchy. From the Monarch, who
owns vast tracks of UK land and lives in palaces, down to the homeless.
Who are nothing more than modern day surfs. As well as our government,
all of our armed services are run by Eton boys, mostly. So, to daily
have a TV series that shows the establishment as it is, a goodly bunch
of them privileged thieves, is to undermine stability.<br /><br />However, the concept of Monarchy is today inherently corrupting. Not so
much money, but what it does to the psych of the UK people. We have a
House of Lords. The very concept of a Lord is inherently demeaning to
those who are not. A congenital corruption of equality. Monarchy gives
the notion that they and all the gongs below are intrinsically superior
to you and me. This is false. And a nation that persists in that
illusion is eventually doomed to fail.<br /><br />I do not advocate revolution. Just awareness and a speedier evolution.<br /><br />So, keep your ear close to the wire.
