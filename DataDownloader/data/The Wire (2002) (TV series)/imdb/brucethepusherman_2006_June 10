I&#39;ve just finished a second viewing of season one of the wire, and I
feel as though television has changed for me. The bar has been raised
and all other cop shows are now irrelevant. This is a masterpiece
worthy of the highest of praise. Each character is so clearly drawn, so
free of clich&eacute;, the story line is so detailed, so relevant, the
duologue is so crisp, so real that I felt as though I lived on a planet
where Starsky and Hutch, Columbo, and Walker: Texas Ranger have never
existed. The arc of the story feels like an opera of break beats and
hardcore Basquiat. Never before has a story of elicit drug use, its
dealers, its junkies, it profiteers, and the people who decide to care
enough to make a change been so perfectly presented. Bravo!
