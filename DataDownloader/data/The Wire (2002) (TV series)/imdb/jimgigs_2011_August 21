This is easily the best show to ever air on television. You get to see
the corruption of government at every level, and more importantly how
it effects the lives of citizens, especially young black kids, cops,
judges, lawyers and politicians. The characters and acting are as great
as the depth of the story that is told. The last season even addresses
the changes that have occurred in the media, as newspapers fighting for
ad revenue in an internet world are willing to compromise there
integrity to sell papers and increase profits. I did not watch the
original run of the series, and after finally watching couldn&#x27;t believe
I ignored it. It is light years better then the sopranos, which was the
darling of hbo when the wire premiered. Simply a must see for any fan
of thought provoking entertainment.
