If you haven&#39;t had a chance to see this series, you should feel guilty.
If you happen to catch this show on a random Sunday night (especially
during the middle of the season), you may be somewhat confused by the
plot, and wrongfully write it off as just another TV crime drama. That
would be a mistake - this series attacks so many story lines and is
incredibly well-written - the more seasons/episodes you watch, the more
you appreciate the plot. Most drug/crime series only focuses on the
cops and thugs - this series focuses on ALL the players. The
politicians, teachers, officers, detectives, attorneys, suppliers,
kingpins, soldiers - all are involved, explored, and in many cases,
exposed.<br /><br />The plot is well-written, the acting is great, and the action is
consistent and intense. Due to the fact it contains many characters and
sub-plots, you will have to watch as many episodes as possible to truly
understand and appreciate it. Bottom line: it is real and
uncompromising - it portrays and attacks every level of our urban
justice system and economic structure. It is hard to explain, but
everything is earned with this series. The investigators do not stumble
across some random item that breaks the case open within an hour-long
episode like your typical crime drama. The dealers have to aggressively
obtain and protect territory. You, the viewer, will have to pay
attention and ignore your urge for instant gratification. Plots and
characters are developed across episodes, not minutes.<br /><br />If you have the time, do yourself a favor and rent (or buy) Seasons 1-4
and watch them before the fifth (and final) season hits HBO in 2007.
You&#39;ll won&#39;t be disappointed, and at the very least, you&#39;ll have a
better idea of how &quot;the game&quot; really is, and who really wins and loses.
An amazing series - &quot;Law and Order&quot; (and the like) now seem boring and
useless.
