I wanted to wait and see if the first season was just a fluke, like the Oz
series. But this series has gotten even better, raising the bar for itself
and for its audience.  The dramatic center has moved from the Heights to
the
docks and we're seeing yet another piece of the complex underworld of
Baltimore.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the cast from the first season is back being further textured
in
their post-trial situations as the dock characters and story-lines are
developed. This kind of work is like slowly dining on a multi-layered
dish.
Your palate is constantly finding some new flavor or texture to savor and
appreciate.<br /><br />I can't recommend this series enough.<br /><br />
