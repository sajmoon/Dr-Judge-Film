I don&#39;t usually use the comment boards on IMDb as I am simply too lazy,
but with The Wire I had to make an exception to express my admiration
for everything this show is.<br /><br />Totally character driven, does not rely on cheap &quot;twists&quot; (and
therefore has no plot holes like, let&#39;s say, 24), does not rely on
dramatic music, has the most real and gritty dialogue and
cinematography, amazing and (fairly) unknown actors - The Wire puts
every other show out there which is trying to portray real life in a
big city to shame. No more. No less.<br /><br />The only drawback is that I am finding it difficult watching other TV
dramas and films after having watched it. They simply seem fake and
contrived in comparison.<br /><br />The storytelling, directing and acting is outstanding.<br /><br />It might be too slow for some, but anyone with an ounce of patience and
intelligence will soon recognise it for what it is: pure genius.<br /><br />The Wire is not to be missed.
