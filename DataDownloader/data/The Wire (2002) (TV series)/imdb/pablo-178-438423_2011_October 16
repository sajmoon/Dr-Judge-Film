Ostensibly a cop series with a story to tell about the drug war in
America&#x27;s inner city (Baltimore, in this case), &#x22;The Wire&#x22; over five
seasons was really an insanely ambitious, intimately detailed
historical document about institutional failure on all levels - cops,
criminals, courts, politics, schools and newspapers. Dense, novelistic,
painful, funny, real and heartbreaking all at once. On top of that it
had pitch-perfect dialogue, elegantly plotted crime stories and a tone
that ranged from elegiac to raunchily funny. This love poem on the life
and death of American cities was as good as TV ever gets.<br /><br />&#x22;The Wire&#x22; is the best television series ever made. Period.
