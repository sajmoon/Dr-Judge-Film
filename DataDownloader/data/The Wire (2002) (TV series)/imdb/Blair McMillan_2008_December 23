After viewing nearly all of what most movie goers would classify the
greatest films ever made, I was skeptical when buying the first season
of the wire on DVD of how it could live up to the expectations various
critics had placed on it as the greatest TV show ever. But after
finishing season 3 I realized that not only was this view apt, but it
was also an understatement of how it has in my mind towered above any
movie I have seen. Of course it doesn&#39;t contain any performances that
would rival Jack Nicholson&#39;s Jack Torrance or Daniel Day-Lewis&#39; Daniel
Plainview, but it manages to ignore this fact with character story arcs
(i.e. Dukie, Bubbles, D&#39;Angelo, Stringer etc.) that are on par with
Dostoyevsky&#39;s treatment of Raskolnikov.<br /><br />It would be an understatement to attribute the show&#39;s brilliance to the
writing when it is met and equaled by the superb cast who always turn
in pitch perfect performances. The depth the cast of relatively unknown
actors manage to lend to their characters are amazing, where characters
such as Omar and Wee Bey could be seen as one dimensional, the skill
with which actors such as these can play out a scene make
characterizations much more complex than they can be read on the page.<br /><br />Another reason that the wire manages to rise above most films lies in
it&#39;s ability to exploit the television medium. Whereas a movie must fit
the constraints of around the 2 hour mark a show such as the wire can
leave plot strands dangling in the air for 7 episodes or so (7 hours)
and as the tension in a number of plot threads being unresolved builds,
truly memorable events can occur, it also allows for a more accurate
portrayal of the passage of time to let the viewer spend time on
earnest reflection (You Remember That One Day Summer Past?) rather than
in a film where it can come across as inappropriately sentimental.<br /><br />After spending some time with the characters and investing your
undivided attention to what is happening on screen, it should become
clear to anyone and everyone watching the show that: it&#39;s not TV, it&#39;s
the wire
