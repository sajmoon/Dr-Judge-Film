I have watched &quot;The Wire&quot; since it&#39;s debut on HBO. The deep story lines
and character development make this an extremely captivating show.
Realistic? Not really. It&#39;s better. I&#39;m a 23 year veteran of a large
law enforcement agency. Believe me, no one would want to watch a truly
realistic police drama. It would be excruciatingly boring. &quot;The Wire&quot;
captures the most dramatic and controversial aspects of police work,
government, politics and bureaucracy and adds just the right amount of
street grit, personal struggle, and action to make this show the
fastest hour you can spend in front of a TV. The strong connections to
the City of Baltimore, complete with accents and on-location filming
compliment the gritty story lines and scenes. But &quot;The Wire&quot; is much
more than a crime drama. &quot;The Wire&quot; delves deep into the hierarchy,
customs and inner politics of the police, street gangs, organized
crime, city and state government, the public schools and the media and
exposes surprising correlations between each. &quot;The Wire&quot; dramatizes how
none of these entities is immune from political corruption,
backstabbing, misconduct, micromanagement, grandstanding, incompetent
leadership, or coups.<br /><br />&quot;The Wire&quot;, at its heart, is an entertaining, intriguing classic
struggle between good and evil. The interesting part is trying to
figure out who is which.
