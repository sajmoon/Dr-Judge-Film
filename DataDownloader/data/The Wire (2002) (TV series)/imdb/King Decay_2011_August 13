If you&#x27;re interested in where it all leads to and what could possibly
be done about it... watch this. If you care that is. Best series ever,
period. Not the easiest TV-series to watch and very demanding in terms
of concentration and plot-following, but there&#x27;s a reason for that. A
straight-forward attack on every single braincell and emotion you have,
without ever intending to hurt you. If reality doesn&#x27;t scare you then
definitely do watch this. It&#x27;s an absolute work of art. When I first
got my hands on this I watched all 13 episodes of the first season in
one stretch, and the three days after that I watched the other four
seasons in one lengthy marathon. Difficult, at times harsh to watch but
oh so truthful and satisfying. Quite simply the very best series ever
made. The acting, directing, the plots, everything : it all blends so
perfectly together resulting in a true jewel. If social engagement
doesn&#x27;t sound like a dirty thing to you then do yourself a favor and
watch this series. You won&#x27;t regret it.
