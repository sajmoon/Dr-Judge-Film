Do yourself a favor and watch this show. If you&#x27;re having a hard time
getting into it at first because not much is happening, be patient -
that&#x27;s the same reaction I had. The writers intentionally made it
slow-developing because they didn&#x27;t want it to be episodic - they meant
each season as one long, arcing, self-contained story. Because of this
there&#x27;s no hurry, sometimes not a lot of action and the episodes don&#x27;t
end on cliffhangers. In other words, it&#x27;s different than most shows.
But give it some time and I think you&#x27;ll agree it&#x27;s better than most.
The acting is top-notch across the board - especially from the
drug-dealing crew - but what really sets The Wire apart is the dialog.
I&#x27;ve never heard such realistic street talk on TV.<br /><br />My favorite scene: one of the early scenes introducing Marlo, when he&#x27;s
swinging the golf club around menacingly and telling Bodie quietly,
&#x22;I&#x27;m being a gentleman about this at the moment.&#x22; <br /><br />Favorite character: a tie between Omar, Stringer, Marlo, Snoop and
Bubs. They are all perfectly cast. Bunk deserves an honorable mention
as well.
