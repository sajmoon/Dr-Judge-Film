Gritty story set in the inner city projects dealing with both sides of the
law.  There is very little that is black and white, just a lot of shades
of
grey.  It isn't polluted with a bunch of no talent &quot;Stars&quot;, as some of the
other shows on HBO.  This series rivals any other that HBO has
produced.
