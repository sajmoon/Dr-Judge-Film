I myself am a very big fan of many different TV Series and have already
watched and loved Heroes, Lost, Prison Break, 24, Weeds,OZ, SVU and a
bunch of others. After I had finished watching Season 6 of Lost, I had
nothing to watch so I went through all of my available options and came
to the conclusion that The Wire had higher average User Rating than
anything else, so I decided to watch it. It wound up being one of the
biggest mistakes I&#x27;ve made in years. I am currently on Episode 6 of the
Second Season and I have yet seen an episode which I had liked. It is
bland, boring, slow and I have yet to care about a single character on
the show. I can go on and on about how miserably terrible this show is,
but I won&#x27;t do that. I will simply tell you that there are many Paid
Programming shows on TV that are better and more exciting than this
show. Be smart and stay clear.<br /><br />- NYtoCALI
