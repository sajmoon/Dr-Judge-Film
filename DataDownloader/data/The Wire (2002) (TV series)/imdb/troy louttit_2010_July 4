Okay.. i&#x27;m sure you don&#x27;t need another glowing review telling you this
is the best show in t.v history but your getting one anyway. Everything
about this show is closer to perfection than any other show out there.
The writing, camera work and acting are all first class. The Wire along
with Sopranos and Deadwood are the 3 essential watches for character
based dramas. The spread of characters offered in the wire is
phenomenal, Marlo, Mcnulty, Omar, Avon, Stringer, Bunk, Michael, Snoop,
the Sabotka&#x27;s the list goes on forever, each with their own detailed
back story and unique personality. The writers are extremely dedicated
to each character so much so that they spend literally hours slowly
exposing you to them bit by bit so that by the time they take their
part in the overall plot you can&#x27;t comprehend what the show was like
without them and in many cases their gone just as abruptly, there is no
loyalty and no fairytale outcomes, just reality. These two features are
i think my favorite aspect about this show. I have absolutely no
problem rating the wire 10/10, it is hands down the best thing I&#x27;ve
ever watched... Twice over.
