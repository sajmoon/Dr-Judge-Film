Set in Baltimore, with story lines of crime and law intertwined with
each other. The show mainly follows Jimmy McNulty (West) and his fellow
detectives and superiors; as well as street level drug dealers of the
Barksdale Organization, led by Avon Barksdale (Harris). Corruption
becomes a subplot and seasonal theme including: the city port (Season
2), the political scene (Season 3), the school system (Season 4) and
the media (Season 5). Praised for its realism, which includes some slow
spots as well as the killing off of its most well-developed characters
at random points in the series. While things slow down and speed up at
many points of the series, there ceases to be anything remotely
uninteresting. The amount of characters that come and go become very
overwhelming to the point that you stop becoming shocked when a
character is written off. It&#x27;s lack of a main character and it&#x27;s
predictable finale are flaws, but easily overlooked by intriguing story
lines.<br /><br />***&#xBD; (out of four)
