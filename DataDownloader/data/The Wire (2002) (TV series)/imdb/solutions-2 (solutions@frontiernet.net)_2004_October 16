Volume 1: When you have police who say &quot;c'mon, let's go out and break
some heads&quot; and behave as it's 1959, it it simply demonstrates the
writers inability to create characters both mean, aggressive and
believable. When there is so much real brutality that cops CAN and DO
get away with, why show stupid unbelievable behavior that cops CAN'T
get away with.. Cops like that wouldn't last 5 minutes. Show them mean
when THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT might have actually meant these vaunted
creators of the show knew what they were talking about. . Another
Hollywood-type cop show but showing crime and degradation you cant show
on network. Yawn, yawn, yawn.<br /><br />Part of the show creates these neaderthal, cookie-cutter moron cops
(one accidentally discharges his handgun in the office!!!). That part
is just silly... Add to that THE DEPUTY COMMISSIONER, CHIEF OF POLICE,
etc. who appear &quot;confounded&quot; over the notion that a neighborhood gang
would kill a witness who testified against one of the gang members who
was later found &quot;not guilty.&quot; Why would they do that, one says in true
&quot;white&quot; astonishment. Apparently that degree of logic - one which helps
any ghetto teenager to recognize- is too &quot;deep&quot; for theose old white
higher - ups, and THIS TYPE OF COOKIE CUTTER character creation, along
with little or diluted chemistry between McNulty and his black partner
or the lesbian (a characer completely 2- dimensional); leave us at
first wanting more, than quickly moving into &quot;do i really want to
more?r. It takes advantage of all the modern hip-hop notions that we've
all hardened ourselves to, but with all it's advantages for a good
show, it fails to create and relies on reharvested old formula. Too
bad. I'll watch a few more episodes maybe. If iu change my mind, I'll
say so. Some of the political developments are good, everyone covering
their butt, etc, was well done. The nephew/uncle relationshipo is good,
but Great? no.<br /><br />OI will say one thing: Whoever their publicist is should get a raise:
never have a seen such cookie-cutter mediocrity get such rave reviews.
To compare this with Sopranos or Six-Feet Under is to compare 1950's
war movies with Saving Private Ryan or Thin Red Line.
