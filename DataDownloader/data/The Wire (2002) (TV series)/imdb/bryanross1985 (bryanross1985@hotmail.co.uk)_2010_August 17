The Wire is not the greatest TV show of all time, it is got even a good
TV show. That is because it cannot be classified as a TV show. This is
reflected in the ratings of the show: consistently low and ever
decreasing.<br /><br />Speak to any fan of The Wire and you will find that very few of them
watched it on TV, most watched it on DVD and of those fans the vast
majority will have the entire collection on DVD.<br /><br />I class myself as a MAJOR fan of the wire and it pains me slightly to
say that it is not a good TV show, that is because it is not a TV show
at all. Can any of the fans out there possibly imagine watching this
one episode at a time, only one episode a week? That would be horrible.<br /><br />The Wire succeeds as it is both essential and compulsive viewing. Not
only is it Dramatic perfection, It also has some very, very funny
moments, exciting scenes and at times it is terrifyingly scary. Not
only does it succeed on a storytelling level, it is also a work of
master craftsmanship, it looks great or looks awful to reflect the
necessary mood of the scene.<br /><br />Of a ll the episodes, there is not one weak episode, of all the
seasons, there is not one weak season (even the Simpsons cannot manage
that). The weak moments are few and far between.<br /><br />I would not call this a TV show, I would not call this a movie (as some
have), I do not know what I would call it, well, I would... Brilliantly
perfect.<br /><br />Watch it at your peril. Nothing will ever or has been as good as The
Wire. And no excuses, this is for EVERYBODY.
