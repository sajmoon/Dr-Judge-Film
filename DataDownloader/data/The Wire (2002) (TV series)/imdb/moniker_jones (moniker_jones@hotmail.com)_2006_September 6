Forgive the hyperbole, but this truly is the best show on television.
And this is coming from someone who watches a lot of great TV (24,
Arrested Development, The Simpsons, Sopranos, Deadwood, Homicide, The
Shield, Six Feet Under, The Office US/UK, Lost, House, Veronica Mars,
etc.)<br /><br />Earlier this summer I wrote an article about the show that was just
recently published in South Texas&#39; primary newspaper, The Monitor.
Here&#39;s a link to that piece, which says more than what I could repeat
here...<br /><br />http://themonitor.com/SiteProcessor.cfm?Template=/GlobalTempl
