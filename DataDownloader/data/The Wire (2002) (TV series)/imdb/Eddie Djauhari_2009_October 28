This show is really details on the story. It describes the regulation
and obstacles that the police Department face on everyday basis. The
wire is the best show ever in my opinion. Compare with Sopranos, OZ,
and other HBO series, this one is on the top of my list, a masterpiece
from Ed Burns. The reason why this story is really thick on the
details, cause Ed Burns was a Baltimore Police. In the first couple
episodes, this show kind of boring, but that feeling disappear after
the fifth episode. The characters and the connection between them is
the soul of this series. Really great stories, it&#x27;s kind of sad they
made it only to five season.
