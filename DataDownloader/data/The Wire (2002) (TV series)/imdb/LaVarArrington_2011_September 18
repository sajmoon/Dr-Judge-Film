Please ignore the most recent comment by &#x22;chazzle dazzle&#x22;, his review
is nothing more than pure sarcasm, and is intended as a joke directed
at me, his friend. The wire is the greatest TV show ever made, so much
so that I have given up watching TV series all together out of pure
smugness for the Wire&#x27;s superiority. &#x22;chazzle dazzle&#x22; is a roommate of
mine, and he himself has watched the wire in its entirety and loves it,
despite his constant chops-breaking about it. I have watched The Wire
in its entirety, twice, and it was probably the greatest 120 hours of
my life. This series has everything. The characters are brilliantly
acted. It&#x27;s an incredible show that leaves you with a feeling of
fulfillment that you just don&#x27;t get from any other show out there. My
friend &#x22;chazzle dazzle&#x22; fails to realize that someone might be
influenced by his review and then they might not watch The Wire, and
then they will go to their grave as an incomplete person for not having
seen it. I wish I could watch this show again for the first time.
