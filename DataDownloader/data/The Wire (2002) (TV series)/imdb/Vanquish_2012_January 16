By far the best show I have ever seen. It might not be the most
influential show, and if you never seen it you might think that it is
another generic cop drama, but it&#x27;s far from that. It&#x27;s extremely
realistic, and the dialog is unmatched, and has been unmatched indeed.<br /><br />However, a common mistake made is that people drop this show after
viewing the first view episodes. I can sympathize with that, because I
felt the same way, because they talk about typewriters for example, and
that might make the show feel old, and it&#x27;s hard to follow at first.
But I would everyone recommend to stay with the show and just work your
way through the first 5 episodes, then you will be completely hooked.
If you drop this show at any point before season 5 you will miss some
of the greatest TV that you will ever see.<br /><br />Unfortunately the weak point of the show is Season 5. It is definitely
not up to the standard of the other seasons. But, even then that season
is still better then a lot of other seasons from other generic shows.
And midway through the season there are some great scenes, and the
ending is not spectacular, but it is a great and solid ending
nonetheless.
