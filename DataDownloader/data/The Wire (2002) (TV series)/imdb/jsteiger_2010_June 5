I&#x27;d heard about The Wire and, in an off-moment, ordered the first DVD
of Season 1 from a rental agency several months ago. It sat on my shelf
for a week before I turned on the first episode while working out on my
rowing machine. I found it complicated and difficult to follow because
of the noise from the rower, so I waited until the evening and powered
it up on my high power surround sound setup. Soon, I was enthralled.
Before long, I was addicted. After the third episode, I told my wife,
&#x22;We have to watch this together,&#x22; and restarted at episode 1. Last
night we completed the final episode of the final season, having
watched every episode. As a university professor who&#x27;s worked with drug
addicts, was once an Honors English major at Cornell, and is a film
fanatic, let me be blunt, because there is little I could add about The
Wire that has not already been said.<br /><br />If you are literate, educated, and an intelligent consumer of fine
drama; If you have the patience to read great novels, and derive great
joy from the way great writers can interweave many characters and
themes, arriving at a point of convergence with perfect timing and
coherence; If you want to watch a show where EVERY character is
portrayed brilliantly, and no character fails to surprise and delight
with the depth and uniqueness of the writing; THIS is the one show you
must see, from beginning to end. The quality, compared to anything else
I have seen, is staggering.<br /><br />You must invest the time. You may need to get a few episodes in before
you become hooked. But trust me...you will be rewarded.<br /><br />As a cinematic achievement, I actually rate this show above The
Godfather Trilogy.
