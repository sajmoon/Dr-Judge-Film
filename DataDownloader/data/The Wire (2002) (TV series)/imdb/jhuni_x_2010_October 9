How did HBO manage to get an amazing group of actors and a superb plot
and keep it going for five seasons? More people should ask themselves
this question so that they may emulate the success of this series.<br /><br />The wire isn&#x27;t a show though, it is one 60 hour long narrative.
Therefore you should watch it in order from start to finish to feel the
full effect.<br /><br />The wire is not some convenient fiction it is reality. By illuminating
the failing education system, drug addicts, drug dealers, police
corruption, and city politics it presents to you the bigger picture of
the cycle of corruption in Baltimore.<br /><br />This show is both entertaining and informative, humorous and horrific,
beautiful and ugly. It is truly a masterpiece, but don&#x27;t take my word
for it, see it for yourself.
