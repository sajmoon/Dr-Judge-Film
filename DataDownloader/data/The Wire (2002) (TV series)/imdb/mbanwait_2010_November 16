The Wire is probably one of the most ambitious shows to ever have been
produced for American TV. <br /><br />Lost, 24 and even the X-files have all been called ambitious, but the
Wire succeeds because it is unrelenting, uncompromising and a hell of a
television series. <br /><br />I am about to start the penultimate episode and then the FINAL episode
of this emotional, intellectual, challenging and of course ambitious
series.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t think we will ever see another show like this one. It was
ignored by audiences (although it is very successful on DVD), ignored
by the awards circuit (who needs em anyway) and of course lauded by
critics.<br /><br />It is one of the greatest TV series that strives to be more than
entertainment. <br /><br />Just WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
