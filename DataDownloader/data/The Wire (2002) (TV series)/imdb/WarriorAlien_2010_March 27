Taken at face value, David Simon and Ed Burn&#x27;s The Wire can be any
number of things: a police procedural, a slice of life, a modern day
epic. Moving beyond these surface elements, The Wire is revealed as a
frightfully honest, even scathing take on contemporary North American
society.<br /><br />As Detective Lester Freamon (Clarke Peters) remarks, &#x22;all the pieces
matter.&#x22; It&#x27;s impossible to reduce this show&#x27;s quality and impact to
any singular element. The writing is of course great, even among the
recent &#x22;comeback&#x22; that scripted television has made, but the show is
further fleshed out by varied and nuanced performances, minimalist
cinematography and the occasionally sublime knowledge that what is
depicted on screen differs relatively little from the reality that is
Baltimore.
