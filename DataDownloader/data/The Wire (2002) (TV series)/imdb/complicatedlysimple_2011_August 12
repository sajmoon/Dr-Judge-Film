Update: As of 10 minutes ago i have completed all five seasons within a
couple of weeks. I have no doubt that this is the finest piece of
storytelling ever put on screen. Read on for my previous review after
season 1:<br /><br />Believe the hype. Believe the IMDb #1 Rank (Planet Earth is more of a
Special than an actual TV Series). This series, if taken seriously,
will change the way you view television, law enforcement, the judicial
system, and the hood. It will also change the way you think, and the
way you dream.<br /><br />Almost 10 years after the first season premiered, i watch it in a span
of 4 days, back-to-back. I&#x27;m not going to lie, the world is a different
place than just 10 years ago, style and technology seems like, well,
its 10 years old in this show. But that is literally the only thing
&#x22;wrong&#x22; with this show. I personally do not find this as a flaw,
because this show is timeless. It is hard to describe just how perfect
this series is.<br /><br />Let me first start off by saying i am the &#x22;hollywood ending&#x22; type of
guy. I cant stand movies that try to be different and artsy by ending a
movie with some b.s. scene or when the story just cuts off and &#x22;let&#x27;s
the viewer imagine what happens.&#x22; F- that. as a viewer, i expect
gratification, not to waste my time. let me tell you something, this
show takes that mentality, and gives it a big reality smack in the
face. this show isn&#x27;t about endings, or beginnings. this show doesn&#x27;t
care about your expectations. this show is simply reality.<br /><br />i have never seen a TV series, nor a movie, for that mattter, as real
and as NATURAL as this series. i say &#x22;natural&#x22; because it is the best
way to describe how one feels about the wire after completing the first
season. I&#x27;ve never felt so much part of the reality of the show. there
are no plot holes whatsoever. in fact, this show goes beyond what you
expect, it gives plothills.<br /><br />the best thing about this show is the writing, bar none. the writing
contains so much wisdom, I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like it
before. you will come out feeling educated about a variety of different
things including politics, law enforcement, legal system, crime, etc.
this is easily the greatest piece of writing put on television in
history.<br /><br />the acting is perfect. it compliments the writing flawlessly. every
single character is interesting, literally. there is not a single
character who i wasn&#x27;t actively interested in. thats all there is to
say.<br /><br />the direction is like Ringo in the Beatles; subtle but perfectly
complimentary to the rest of the formula. There are a few awesome shot
that expand the scope of the scene, such as shots through a security
camera or through infrared. the music, as well, is simply perfect;
non-existent until it mattes most.<br /><br />I&#x27;ve only watched the first season, and im going to be honest, i don&#x27;t
want to watch the other seasons. i don&#x27;t want it to be over, i wish the
wire had 20 seasons, 5 is just not enough. after the first, im going to
really take my time and milk this series for as long as i can. the last
thing i want to do is burn through it. it is like a vial is magical
power that you only have so much of for the rest of your life...you
don&#x27;t want to waste it.<br /><br />but then again, there is nothing else id rather watch than the wire.<br /><br />p.s., you wont realize the magic the wire has until you&#x27;re in the
middle of it. the wire is truly about the journey, not the destination.
