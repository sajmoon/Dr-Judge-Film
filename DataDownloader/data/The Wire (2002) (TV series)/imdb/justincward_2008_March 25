The best drama on TV in twenty years, some say. I won&#39;t argue with that
except to say that it&#39;s closer to call than some think, but The Wire
didn&#39;t get the high ratings or awards &#39;it deserved&#39; because of its weak
female characterisation, and women are the TV watchers.<br /><br />Don&#39;t flame me yet: in The Sopranos we had Carmela, Meadow, Melfi,
Janice, Adrianna - all full characters who arced and developed with the
rest of the men. In Six Feet Under we had Claire, Ruth, Brenda and
Vanessa - all fully-fledged characters who arced, etc. In Deadwood the
female characters had less to do, but hey - it was 1876, and Trixie was
a better act and still more pivotal than any woman in The Wire, even
Kima - who sat out the last half of season 1. Rhonda started out a slut
then went all prim for no particular reason, and Snoop - who as a
character was butcher than a lot of the men, didn&#39;t arc at all. The
rest of the females sat and waited for the cops and robbers to come
home. Kima was the only developed female character in a cast of 40, and
then the Kima/Cheryl plot was perfunctory. The Wire is basically about
boys being naughty and listening to The Pogues or R&#39;n&#39;B. Great if
you&#39;re a boy, but don&#39;t expect too many people to wait a week between
episodes for that.<br /><br />Another problem I had with The Wire was the beautifully acted sex - it
was gratuitous. You suddenly thought, &#39;Is that really his penis?&#39;,
rather than thinking about how it was relevant to the story. Herc&#39;s
reaction shot to the beej was enough.<br /><br />My third issue with The Wire is how David Simon seems to be claiming
that &#39;evil/good gray areas&#39; have never been done before on TV. Well,
The Sopranos did it many times, and they weren&#39;t the first by a very
long chalk. I&#39;d go so far as to say that&#39;s what the Sopranos ending was
about.<br /><br />What makes The Wire&#39;s polemical angle so effective is the fact that
it&#39;s David Simon settling old scores with the Baltimore&#39;s PD, Education
Department and The Sun, rather than giving a fair picture of the
situation. It&#39;s his bias (and the obvious true-ish anecdotes) that
makes it entertaining. I&#39;m not saying The Wire didn&#39;t have brilliant
writing, acting, directing and all the rest of it, and there were many
unforgettable moments that everybody needs to see; but I am saying that
its ratings failure was due to the lack of female characterisation, not
the gritty realism (which never addressed its own sexism, unlike Mad
Men) or largely Afro-American cast. Oh, and I liked season 2 and
thought season 5 was lame. You feel me?
