As of now, I am relatively new to The Wire. After watching practically
every other TV programme that was available (including The Sopranos and
The Shield) I stumbled across this. At first I didn&#39;t find myself
attracted to the show and seemed to detest its exceedingly slow pace.
However I continued watching and after about 3 episodes, the plot
finally started to click into place. <br /><br />This is a testimony to how intricate and complex The Wire is. It takes
3 episodes at least to introduce the characters and to successfully
establish a huge array of motives, agendas and sub-plots (these
subsequently link into the main drug plot). This period of introduction
is understandable when you take into account that both sides of the law
must be explored. <br /><br />Simply, the show is about a detail of mainly low-level detectives and
cops that are brought together to take down Avon Barksdale (a drug
dealer in Baltimore). From here on in, we get an intriguing, realistic
take on police work and are allowed to witness the evolution of a drug
case from the ground up. The meticulous detail and the interweaving
subplots are great.<br /><br />This isn&#39;t to say that the writing is the sole reason to watch this so.
The drama unfolds via some excellent (and sometimes subtle) character
development, that never hinders the main storyline or imposes itself
upon the audience. We gradually build an understanding and opinion of
these characters on our own, without the spoon-feeding dialogue present
in many other shows. The audience are allowed to watch Detectives
McNulty, Greggs, Bunk, Freeman and many more work there way through the
series. Nothing occurs unnaturally and nobody undergoes any weird
transformation throughout the series. Just like reality, the characters
we see at the beginning are in principal, the characters we see at the
end (the only exceptions being the rather misleading introductions of
certain characters.) The underplayed, natural acting prorated in this
show is great (the only disadvantage being the lack of awards it
attracts.)<br /><br />I wouldn&#39;t say this is the most entertaining show, or even the greatest
show, ever. However it is one of the most well-written, well-acted and
adult shows around. Watch it, appreciate it (and then check out The
Shield!). TV this good surely can&#39;t exist for long!
