The Wire delivers a fierce examination of the city of Baltimore and is
simultaneously, in the words of its creator David Simon, &#x27;a police
series that focuses on the institutional dysfunction created by the war
on drugs&#x27;. This is a highly realistic drama. Cases are built over a
whole 13 hour season; they fall apart, take unexpected turns and are
never completely resolved. The police department&#x27;s investigations into
the drug trade in Baltimore span all five seasons but The Wire also
takes time to explore extensively the inner city school system, the
political system, the ports, and somewhat less rigorously in the final
season the news room at The Baltimore Sun. This results in a wide
ranging social demographic of characters throughout the series all of
whom are portrayed with humanity and precision. Real credit should go
to David Simon and the show&#x27;s creative team for refusing to accept
black and white views of the world; the show devotes an equal amount of
time to the police and the criminals and allows the audience to draw
their own conclusions about the morality of each character.<br /><br />The show has an ensemble cast of relatively unknown actors, David Simon
chose to stay true to the spirit of the show and avoid casting heavy
weight guest stars, with a significant number of characters who at some
point in the show become a lead. These characters are not born from
stereotypes, they are all individuals with their own ambitions,
thoughts, mannerisms and ideas. Nothing is shown in a rose-tinted
light, the police officers are not so much interested in improving life
for the citizens of their city but in proving that they can outsmart
their criminal counterparts and the criminals themselves have their own
code by which they operate. Two of the characters that best epitomise
the show&#x27;s tone and intensity are Detective Jimmy McNulty, played by
Englishman Dominic West, who is a womaniser, alcoholic and a divorced
father to two children and Bubbles, the homeless drug addict who funds
his habit by working as an informer for the police at considerable risk
to himself. These two in particular have so much depth that it would
not be surprising to meet either in the street and it is impossible not
to empathise all of the show&#x27;s characters. Criminals have never been
portrayed as such complex human beings or indeed as terrifying as Omar
Little, the &#x22;stick-up boy&#x22; who stalks the city with shotgun in tow, and
Snoop, a young woman who spends her nights executing her superior&#x27;s
rival dealers.<br /><br />The Wire is a slow-burner, plots unravel at a speed some will find
tedious subsequently it requires the viewer to invest in the show, if
you&#x27;re not switched on you&#x27;ll soon find yourself lost in the city with
no idea of what is happening in the numerous plot lines. David Simon
and producer, Ed Burns, an ex police officer, create enthralling story
lines and are helped by contributions from heavyweight crime novelists
Dennis Lehane, Richard Price, and George Pelecanos who also worked
extensively on production for the show. The dialogue is crisp, sharp
and at times eminently quotable and humorous. It can also be difficult
to understand initially with police jargon thrown around without
explanation as to the meaning and the criminals speaking in a unique
dialect which may alienate some viewers.<br /><br />President Barack Obama named The Wire as his favourite television show
during his election campaign and if he can make time for it so can
anyone else.<br /><br />&#x22;The Wire could have, if we&#x27;d done everything wrong, been a cop show.&#x22;
