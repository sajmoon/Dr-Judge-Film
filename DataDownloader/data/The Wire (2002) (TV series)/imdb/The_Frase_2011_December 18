When I was told that The Sopranos had been beaten to the top of a
popular UK TV channel poll by another series I first denied belief but
quickly looked to find out why.<br /><br />The Wire, throughout all its seasons is definitely one of the best
television series ever produced. It&#x27;s the tale of the city of
Baltimore, through the eyes of police, drug dealers, dock workers,
gangsters, politicians, teachers, judges, lawyers and children.Its
excellent writing and acting makes it clear why even such a popular and
acclaimed show as The Sopranos was beaten by it.<br /><br />The series was based on real life experiences of writers David Simon
and Ed Burns and this realism forms the main spine of the show. The
show depicts of the inner workings of numerous city institutions, each
series documenting another facet of city life where law and order and
crime and chaos share close a proximity and often overlap. The
brilliant writing and acting (numerous members of the cast where
Baltimore natives cast due to their similar upbringings/lifestyles of
their on screen characters and were previously unknown) is what gives
the show its impact. Every second of screen time constructs gripping
episode story lines that weep into future series, no lose end is ever
left untied and often things that occur which may seem incidental can
have huge ramifications on other characters in future episodes.<br /><br />The unrelenting focus on realism is also one of the main problems
people face when entering the world of Baltimore. The use of street
slang and specialised language by sections of the community especially
the street kids and gang members can be a hard translations for those
of us unfamiliar with the Maryland city. But this resistance to add a
Hollywood gloss only empowers the show more and distances it from its
more mainstream counterparts.<br /><br />The characters are well written and excellently acted there is not one
instance of miscasting. The diverse characters and social situations
gives each part of the community its platform and equal importance.<br /><br />This is true of other shows but few allow such deep and profound bonds
to develop between characters and audience. In &#x27;The Wire&#x27; each and
every character is sacred, you will mourn the loss of those that die
and celebrate in the victories of others.<br /><br />Through-out the entirety of the show scenes of brutal and graphic
violence, drug consumption and death are juxtaposed against a dark
comedic undertone and a celebration of life.<br /><br />This show is more than glorification of crime, law and order, its more
than the shock for shock value, and its more than gritty realism. It&#x27;s
a tale of a community en mass, a social commentary of the effect of the
failed war on drugs on the inner cities of America, the social
corruption and inequalities that derive from it and those who are
battling the tide against it.<br /><br />If your still wondering if the show is going to be for you then watch
the opening episodes and if you avoid addiction then you probably
weren&#x27;t paying attention, it is that good.
