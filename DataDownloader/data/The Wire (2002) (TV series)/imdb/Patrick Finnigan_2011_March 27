My friend Dolu convinced me I needed to watch The Wire, and I asked for
the boxed set for Christmas this past year. It took a while to build
and for me to understand the show, but that investment was worthwhile.
I&#x27;ve just finished season 3, and I have to say I&#x27;ve never been this
impressed with a TV show before, period.<br /><br />The Wire succeeds on several levels due to quality in production value.
HBO is head-and-shoulders above the networks here. It helps they have
hour-long blocks and don&#x27;t depend on mid-episode crescendos to cater to
advertisers. The acting is phenomenal (e.g. Rawls).<br /><br />The main credit, however, goes to the writers in my opinion. The
screenplay is brilliant and merges together a patchwork of parallel
story lines into a coherent whole. The characters are strong,
authentic, and memorable. Most impressive is how realistic the show
feels - this creates an immersive experience of the streets of
Baltimore. It has to be difficult to write lines for politicians,
detectives, and gangsters and to make all of them seem convincing, but
that is what The Wire has mastered.<br /><br />The show is not easy to watch. Not that there is much violence...
there&#x27;s some. There is a LOT of crude language, some nudity/sex,
racism/homophobia/sexism... the show does not back down or censor
itself. You get the raw experience. While the language is coarse, the
show is mostly difficult to watch because of the heaviness of its
themes and the personal investment required before it starts paying
dividends - you need to watch several episodes before you &#x27;get&#x27; the
show, and you have to finish several seasons before seeing maximum
returns.<br /><br />&#x22;Crime drama&#x22; is normally a genre I shun, but The Wire transcends the
genre and achieves greatness as a general (dark) drama. There is great
commentary here on the intractable issues facing modern cities and
societies. The themes run deep and hit home. The characters are
unforgettable. 5/5 stars... And I&#x27;m also finally signing up for HBO.
