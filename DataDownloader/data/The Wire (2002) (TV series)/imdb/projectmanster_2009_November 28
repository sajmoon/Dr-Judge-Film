There&#x27;s no way to describe the amazing, intellectual, visual wonderment
that is The Wire. David Simon (The creator) should be in charge of
every single thing on TV. He&#x27;s amazing, his words are amazing, and this
show is the best television show of all time. Reigning Champion. The
way that he&#x27;s able to give a complete feeling of being where the show
takes place (Baltimore). Baltimore is actually the main character of
the show, because every second of The Wire is filmed in Baltimore and
shows everybody everything about the city. The characters on this show
are the most compelling, real, lovable/hatable, true to humanity
characters I&#x27;ve ever seen in a television show, or maybe even in a
movie. All in all, if you&#x27;re a fan of great television shows that suck
you in, watch The Wire. It&#x27;s the most satisfying beginning and ending
to a show I&#x27;ve ever seen.
