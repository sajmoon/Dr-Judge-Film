For once, the hyperbole is justified. Watching &#39;The Wire&#39; makes you
angry - not because of the injustice, poverty or corruption it so
unerringly portrays. No, what makes you really angry is the dawning
realisation that every other TV series you have ever watched has short
changed you. Watching &#39;The Wire&#39; is like picking up a meaty novel when
all you&#39;ve ever read before are flimsy short stories. It has taken
nearly 50 years, but finally a show has come along that has realised
the full potential of the medium of television.<br /><br />&#39;The Wire&#39; is the culmination of Ed Burns and David Simon&#39;s experience
of Baltimore, which becomes in their hands a microcosm of America.
Burns, a former homicide cop who became teacher, and Simons a
journalist, manage to combine unflinching realism with literary
ambition and cinematic brilliance augmented by wonderfully fresh
performances. Throwing away the conventions of episodic TV drama &#39;The
Wire&#39; instead sets its sights higher and creates stories that span
entire seasons rather than simply filling the time between ad breaks.
There are no neat resolutions here.<br /><br />This novelistic approach to drama pays off in intricate story lines and
in depth characterisation that absorb and compel in a way that nothing
before has ever quite managed or even attempted. If you expect TV drama
to provide neat story-lines that culminate in the moral surety of the
&#39;good guys&#39; winning and the &#39;bad guys&#39; getting their comeuppance, then
think again. &#39;The Wire&#39; confounds expectations and lays bare a world
where conventional morality is illusory and where everybody simply
plays &#39;The Game&#39; the best they know how. You realise that in this world
there are no good guys, no bad guys, just people trying to get by
within a system that has comprehensively failed them. This could be
anywhere, this could be everywhere.<br /><br />&#39;The Wire&#39;, then, is not simply a masterpiece of TV but a masterpiece
full stop. It stands right up there with the greatest novels, films and
plays of the last 100 years or so. Just beware, though, that once
you&#39;ve watched it ordinary TV will seem shallow and meaningless in
comparison.
