The best thing you can say about The Wire is that is so close to real
life that it lingers in your mind even months after having seeing it .
In the end this can be said of very few series /films throughout the
years and for me there is no doubt that The Wire is among those
creations which truly have marked an era <br /><br />Moreover in some ways it marks a new milestone as we don&#x27;t realize how
hard is to keep the interest for 5 entire seasons and to display such a
wide and varied portrait of characters as The Wire does.... in this
sense Simon&#x27;s merit is even greater.This is not the prototypical 90
minutes gangster&#x27;s film ,it last for about 60 hours where all ends of
Baltimore&#x27;s daily life are covered , from the obvious drugs dealing to
political corruption, from failure to success ,all of which may led to
same deadly end . <br /><br />Simon and the corresponding directors for each chapter always manage to
show raw situations in a totally realistic way .Moreover these are
shown through the eyes of the carefully designed characters , with whom
you totally come to empathize , which adds a empathy note to the
equation which makes the outcome ever more raw <br /><br />You come to care and to suffer for all the characters involved as if
they were real , it&#x27;s difficult to say what matters more : the
situation or the characters &#x85;you can always take opposite sides., maybe
Omar or Stringer and many of the characters are acting wrong but you
totally wish that they will be able to get away with it &#x85;no matter how
much pain they are causing <br /><br />Plot is so full of grip , ramifications and twist on the plot are so
many and so carefully put together that seems that you are actually
living in the east Baltimore and dealing with all these trouble
yourself. It&#x27;s not even that all twist are unexpected , as there are
times when some consequences are quite foreseeable, you can easily
figure out how some of the main characters will end due to their
suicide life style but this doesn&#x27;t make them any less impacting when
the moment of truth finally comes <br /><br />Omar can be a ruthless killer but come to care for this man, same for
Bubbles , it&#x27;s impossible not to suffer for him when you see him again
dragged down and shooting himself heroine once more <br /><br />What else can be said about The Wire , there are not enough words to
describe how magnificent this series actually is . Never an above 9
rate on the IMDb has been so fair and duly deserved as this one.
