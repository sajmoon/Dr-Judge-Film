The Wire is without doubt the greatest TV show off all time. The story
lines, the characters, the intelligence, the realism... The Wire has it
all. After about 6 episodes i was hooked and never looked back. Anyone
that gives The Wire a chance will be rewarded. I recommend you have a
few days off work because when one episode finished you will be playing
the next straight after. After watching all 5 seasons all i felt was
disappointment, the reason for this was, 1 - it had ended and i just
wanted to continue watching these amazing characters and story line
unfold and 2 - nothing will ever compare. I have watched many an
excellent TV show since and as good as they are they will never surpass
The Wire.<br /><br />There is a reason so many reviews on here claim in to be the best show
of all time and i would just like to cement this view. Do yourself a
favour and watch The Wire but be warned no show you ever watch after it
will compare!
