A superb television drama. Centred on the Baltimore Police Department,
this ambitious serial casts a city-wide net to take in the dark
political manoeuvring from both the very top to the very bottom of
Baltimore society.<br /><br />The basic premise revolves around the existential drive of detective
Jimmy McNulty, played by Brit Dominic West. Like most of the other
characters throughout all 5 seasons he&#x27;s prepared to bend or break
rules to get his way - the difference is that he is not driven by
personal ambition. His warped sense of ethical entitlement takes him
from drug busts to post- industrial corruption, politically motivated
&#x27;juking&#x27; (i.e. budget- impacting statistical and policy spin) and
schools. The final season deals with the cumulative fallout of these
endless strata of corruption in the truth-parallel universe of the
media. All the while the &#x27;Major Crimes Unit&#x27;, an ad hoc bunch that
revolves around the persistent McNulty press for The Wire, the hard won
technological tap that will bring home the big cases at the centre of
each season.<br /><br />The Wire has been called the greatest television there has ever been.
It is not that - the stakes are too common and the genre too familiar -
yet it is remarkable in two ways.<br /><br />The first is in the writing. I watched all five seasons of The Wire
back-to-back in a fortnight and I was grateful for that opportunity. I
cannot see how a single episode on its own would be truly satisfying in
the manner of, say, The Sopranos. David Simon&#x27;s vision is wildly
ambitious, taking in huge arcs of storyline with very little to
compensate the occasional viewer. That said, I like the manner in which
the show is made - I got the vernacular immediately and it is
continually satisfying stylistically.<br /><br />The second is the demographic, and this is where The Wire stands equal
to any other TV show. It is clearly an exceptional show for its
depiction and use of black actors. For all that there is a smattering
of stereotypes, there are a considerable number of truly original roles
created by now-unforgettable actors. There are three I need to mention
here: the perennial Bunk, McNulty&#x27;s partner, is played by Wendell
Pierce as a wonderful complex of preening urban ennui, and small-town
heart; Michael K Williams and Andre Royo play the surprising, classical
roles in the &#x27;hood with staggering aplomb, the former as Omar, a Robin
Hood figure, the latter as the mercurial junkie Bubbles, an Ariel or
sacred fool of the ghetto.<br /><br />The first and third seasons are the finest - the second is well
composed but comparatively a little flat and the fourth has a
well-meant but facile &#x27;Dangerous Minds&#x27; flavour to it (although the
children&#x27;s acting is as good as any before or after it). Season five is
too ambitious, but again necessarily. Perhaps it&#x27;s too tall an order.
Nonetheless it&#x27;s a frank, arresting and utterly modern social drama,
with everybody hustling for space in the dying city&#x27;s ever-narrowing,
increasingly perplexing ontological streets. 7/10
