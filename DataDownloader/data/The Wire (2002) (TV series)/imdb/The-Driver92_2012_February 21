On the basis of previous reviews, you&#x27;d never know that this series was
on the verge of being canceled at least twice, that it never made
satisfactory numbers for HBO, or that it was almost universally ignored
by award committees despite its fervid following.<br /><br />There&#x27;s a number of things for the faint-hearted or first time viewers
to know about The Wire before you jump in:<br /><br />1. There is no denouement, no simple, clear resolution at the end of
every episode ala CSI, NCIS, or any other typical police drama. On the
contrary, The Wire is the epitome of the &#x22;slow build&#x22;, it takes
episodes to get started, much less finished. As in life, there are
rarely any easy, clear resolutions at the end. Unlike the black and
white worlds of network TV, The Wire is all gray.<br /><br />2. There is not a simple, single story line. Rather The Wire is
characterized by complex, multiple story arcs that can extend over more
than one season. It demands (and rewards) concentration, rather than
escape. Redemption and revenge are possible, but not in one episode or
one season. The Wire requires patience.<br /><br />3. There are no clear cut heroes and villains (this is the
anti-&#x22;Heroes&#x22; TV show.) There are only human beings, all flawed.
McNulty, a hero, is an alcoholic who cheats on his wife. Even Marlowe,
the apparently soulless villain, grapples with very human issues of
loyalty and pride.<br /><br />4. Though there are great, fully realized characters (almost too many
for escapist viewers to follow), and though to some degree Baltimore,
the city, is a central character, the abiding presences in The Wire are
Baltimore&#x27;s institutions and organizations: courts, city government,
educational system, labor unions, police, newspapers. Even gangs are
seen as just another organization. Unlike any other show I&#x27;ve ever
seen, The Wire demonstrates how institutions are built from a complex
web of relationships and motivations and seem to have an existence
independent of those who participate in them. And it does so in such a
subtle way that it&#x27;s not automatically obvious. It doesn&#x27;t appear to be
about institutions, but it is. That&#x27;s subtlety.<br /><br />That&#x27;s only a start. There&#x27;s more that makes The Wire a challenge for
viewers: it&#x27;s non- linearity (it&#x27;s more like a spiral), it&#x27;s bleak view
of cities and urban institutions; the seeming randomness of so many
events that impact lives, etc., etc., etc.<br /><br />All that said, The Wire, for those willing to make the investment of
time and attention, is a transcendent, moving experience. However
downbeat it&#x27;s subject matter, it is, in the end, a true work of art, a
masterwork, and as such ultimately enabling and uplifting. And just a
thrill to watch.
