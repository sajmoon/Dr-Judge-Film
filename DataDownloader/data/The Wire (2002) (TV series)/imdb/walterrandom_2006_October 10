I know 10 out of 10 sound a little out there. However, this show
deserves the ranking of perfect because that&#39;s what it is. If you start
watching it, you must start from the beginning because unlike most
television where every episode stands alone and they all seem like they
are unaware of their previous episodes...the episodes from the &quot;Wire&quot;
learn from the previous episodes to propel the story, the characters,
and the entire scope of the show forward. This is not clich&eacute;
television. There is no set of 5-7 main characters and this show
doesn&#39;t follow the new trend of killing off characters just to kill
them off to maintain that niche of &quot;edgy.&quot; This is the real deal. This
is &quot;the wire.&quot;
