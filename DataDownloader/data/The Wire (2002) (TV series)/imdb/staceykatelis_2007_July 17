Watching The Wire is realizing that you have never been so enthralled
or engaged in a television show. Raising the bar, tantalizing the
senses, (the acting is magnificent), and best of all, challenging the
mind. I have never felt so satisfied from watching the box. These
characters are so meaty, so real, so utterly delicious. Police and drug
dealers alike, all are likable and despicable, all have their moments.
They are, to sum up, human. I can&#39;t figure out who I&#39;m rooting for -
but that&#39;s exactly what I love about this show. I cannot stop after one
episode and am getting to bed rather late these days, this will
continue until I finish off the box set at least. I&#39;m just wondering,
if this ends, will I ever be satisfied with anything else again? I may
as well throw the TV out! How brilliantly creative! Excellent excellent
excellent stuff!
