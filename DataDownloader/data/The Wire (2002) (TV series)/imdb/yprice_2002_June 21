Ok, I guess I am spoiled when it comes to cop shows set in Baltimore. One
of
the best cop shows of all time, &quot;Homicide: Life on the Street&quot; was an
excellent show that showcased excellent writing and a fantastic cast.
Homicide, was the kind of show where you were interested in the characters
and their storylines.<br /><br />Ok, fast forward to &quot;The Wire&quot; I must say for one, that I am disappointed
with this show. I find myself not really caring about any of the
characters
or the storylines. The acting is ok, nothing great and in fact the &quot;drug
dealers&quot; on the show are portrayed in a typical, cliche' fashion.
Personally, it does not seem as if the writers have put any creativity in
any of the roles. And for this show to be on HBO, it is a HUGE
disappointment.<br /><br />I am marking the days on my calendar to when the new season of Six Feet
Under returns because this cop show is a waste.
