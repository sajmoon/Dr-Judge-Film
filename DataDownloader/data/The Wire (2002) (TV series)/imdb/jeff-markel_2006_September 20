HBO has the best shows on television, and (now that Deadwood is pretty
much done) The Wire is the best show on HBO.<br /><br />Smartly written fiction, it feels truer than most documentaries. David
Simon and his co-writers have been producing work at almost this level
for many years now, from Homicide to The Corner to The Wire, and it
just keeps getting better.<br /><br />The acting in The Wire is phenomenal. The cast are mostly actors whose
faces are not too familiar, though they should be. The best known,
Dominic West, has had a semi-burgeoning movie career, but his character
Jimmy McNulty has been moved from center-stage in the first two seasons
to an occasional featured player. Clarke Peters, Reg E Cathey, Frank
Faison, Wendell Pierce, Glynn Turman - these are just a small sampling
of the great actors on this show.<br /><br />The characters of The Wire, from the lowliest junkies through to the
movers and shakers of Baltimore, are fully rounded out - they&#39;ve become
as real to me as any character in a great novel. I can&#39;t wait to find
out what happens to them.
