2008_June 3 
Just got done watching all the seasons over several months and have to
say I don&#39;t think in my 30 something yrs. of life I can say I have seen
better television!! This show has tremendous hype by fans and critics
and it does not disappoint. Not sure if it is realistic as I don&#39;t live
in the hood, but can say it tackles SO MANY issues regarding violence
and drug use from the crack heads who use, the sellers who treat it
like a business, the police whose job it is to shut it down and
everyone else around who is affected.<br /><br />The show takes a serious and no hold look at the great and the bad
among all the characters. Some of the time u end up detesting the
police and politicians and end up feeling bad for the low level
criminals.<br /><br />If u like crime drama or just like good storytelling u gotta check this
out. My only rec. is give it an honest shot (4-5 episodes) before
judging. Trust me it will hook u!! Also, don&#39;t worry about trying to
remember every character and detail that his not what the show is
about.<br /><br />Best compliment I can give for this show is it is like a work of art. U
watch it and u may not understand the full meaning, but u appreciate
the talent that went into making it.<br /><br />Job well done!!
