Just out of curiosity.how does the Baltimore in the T.V.series compare
to the real one? is it one of the Cities in the States with a major
drug problem? do the projects portrayed in the show have any comparison
with a real life area in Baltimore.we&#39;re the docks in the second series
shot in Baltimore and how do the people of the city see this show?<br /><br />I am only half way through the second season but already hooked on this
show and got to thinking just how realistic it is.and can anyone tell
me is homicide life on the street worth investing in on DVD box set.<br /><br />I can&#39;t honestly see their being much better on TV than this show and
already i&#39;m looking forward to buying the third season on DVD.
