This show had been recommended to me by a number of friends whose
opinions I trust, so I was fairly confident that I was going to be
hooked from the start. But after watching the first episode, I found
myself feeling a number of things I didn&#39;t expect, none of which I
would describe as &quot;hooked.&quot; That came a little later. Most of what I
was struck by in the pilot was the utter lack of an internal story arc.
Not satisfying at all. It felt like I was watching the first hour of a
14 hour movie. I couldn&#39;t grasp who was who, what any of the characters
real intentions were, not even more than one or two of their names.
Never have I seen a less self-contained pilot. I realized after a few
more episodes that this is where the greatness of the show comes from.
It does not trouble itself with constantly trying to entertain, to
clutter itself with unnecessary sub-plots it can tie up quickly. All it
is is what matters, and that is creating and examining a real
environment and a real case. <br /><br />The Wire is the most honest portrayal of an inner city that has ever
been done. There are no good guys and bad guys, just a complicated
hierarchy made up of people looking out for themselves. Things don&#39;t
get neatly wrapped up at the end of the hour, not even at the end of
the season. Episodes sometimes feel like they begin and end
arbitrarily, installments on a story too big to ever fully tie down.
The result is that I feel genuinely invested in the fates of the
characters, and that I have had a unique opportunity to examine a world
I never otherwise would have seen.
