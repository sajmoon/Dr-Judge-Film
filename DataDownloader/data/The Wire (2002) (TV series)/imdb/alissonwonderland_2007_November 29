I checked out the Wire because I had heard it was well written and one
of my best friends really enjoyed it. <br /><br />To relate to the other comments, I can not watch TV again. <br /><br />I&#39;m someone with a background in literary criticism and it is not often
that I feel challenged by anything in the media. I feel that television
for the most part is not something that people should pride themselves
on understanding because it is made to be &quot;easy and entertaining&quot; and
as a viewer one should sit back while they figure out the easy moral.
The Wire is anything but that, it is not this false complex idea with
easy to read understand symbolism or clich&eacute;s. The show is like reading
a book. Only it is not some terrible paperback crime novel it like
Dostoevsky or Dickens. One can watch it over and over again and find
something new.<br /><br />This show breaks every clich&eacute;. It deals with urban America&#39;s poverty in
a humane way and brings it to the forefront. The show shows how
everything is connected and the scary part is, as much as mainstream
media would like middle class America to distance themselves from these
problems they affect everyone. The actors are of all shapes, sizes, and
sexualities. This is a welcome relief as it makes the characters much
more believable. I&#39;m a huge musical elitist and the music, when it is
used-mainly in the background but often describes a character-i.e.
Jimmy McNulty is an Irish cop and he listens to the Pogues, and the
choices are excellent. The theme song was written by TOM WAITS so that
should say a lot about the content of the show.<br /><br />Unfortunately I can not suggest this show to everyone, which in my true
musical elitist fashion, makes me enjoy it all the more. If one can not
handle detailed stories and gets bored easily than this is not the show
for you. But if you are sick of watching the same clich&eacute;d TV shows and
want something with more substance than it seems possible to
handle-I&#39;ve often described this show as &#39;my crack&#39;-you need to watch
it.
