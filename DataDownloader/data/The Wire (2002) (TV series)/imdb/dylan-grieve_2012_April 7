This show is for those of you who are sick of clich&#xE9;d police dramas. <br /><br />If you want a series that feels very real, then give this show a try.
The Wire is written by retired Baltimore detective David Simon, and I
believe his experience in the field is the primary reason why this show
is so insightful. Simon doesn&#x27;t shirk away from anything, and the show
is a reflection of exactly how he sees the world. There is no forced
moral message, and the scenes aren&#x27;t written for shock value or
sensationalism; they are written for truth which is strongly felt
throughout the show. Each episode challenges the commonly implied &#x22;good
versus bad&#x22; message of Hollywood. The long-term storyline gives an
intimate look into the lives of characters, so viewers are more likely
to empathize and see them as normal people with normal problems just
struggling to survive, rather than &#x22;good guys&#x22; or &#x22;bad guys&#x22;. The
concepts of good and evil are explored in new ways; no character is
exempt from the basest corruption or the greatest sacrifice. In this
way, the show is a study into deeper aspects of human nature in terms
of what motivates us to think and act in certain ways, and how we
rationalize decisions. In Baltimore, the cops and drug dealers are all
part of the same struggle. It&#x27;s as truthful as anything I&#x27;ve ever
watched on television. When I say truthful, I mean that he covers the
human experience in a way that is amazing. He delves into all aspects
of the city life of Baltimore: Politics, police, drugs, money,
corruption. The Wire doesn&#x27;t attempt to build anyone up into a hero; in
fact, the closest thing to a hero in the show is a drunken,
self-destructive womanizer with a certain endearing quality that makes
us identify with him. So if you want a series that pursues truth over
ratings, give this a shot; I think you&#x27;ll like it.
