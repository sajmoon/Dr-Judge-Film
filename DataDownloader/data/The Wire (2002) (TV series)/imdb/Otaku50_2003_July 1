I first got hooked on, &quot;The Wire&quot; midway through the first season, and
have
been following it faithfully ever since. This series, in my opinion, puts
&quot;Six Feet Under&quot;, &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, and &quot;Sex And The City&quot; to shame. With a
great story, intriguing characters, and some of THE BEST DIALOGUE that I
have heard on T.V. yet, this series will keep me entertained in the many
weeks to come!<br /><br />However, some of you may believe that this series is too slow. A word form
the wiser: What do you think REAL police work in a REAL city is like?
Don't
expect the case to be solved in one hour's time, like so many other T.V.
shows tend to do. This show is for an INTELLIGENT audience, and you must
pay
attention. Set in Baltimore, the series analyzes the ins and outs of both
the police and the criminals in realistic form. It also comments on the
massive bureaucracy and political forces involved in putting together an
investigation, and also the attempts of a few individuals who are torn
between the whole truth and the public truth. See it now!
