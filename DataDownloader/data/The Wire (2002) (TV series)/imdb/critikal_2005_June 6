the wire is definitely the best show ever made. most realistic stuff
ever. i takes a couple of episodes to get into it because it's pretty
slow compared to the average show but once you get into it, you just
become addicted. unlike other police shows this one deals with ONE
investigation during its 4 entire seasons while in other shows cases
are closed in one episode. another good thing about THE WIRE is that we
follow both cops and thugs without any superficial caricature we find
on CSI and such,THE WIRE keeps it real all the way. incredibly well
written, amazing photography and oustanding actors, this is the kind of
show that should be covered with emmies...
