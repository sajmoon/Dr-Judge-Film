Unlike most television crime dramas who introduce and then solve a case
in about an hour, David Simon has created a show that follows one
single drug/homicide investigation in the length of a whole season&#39;s
worth. The Wire is centered around the drug culture of the city of
Baltimore. Again Unlike most shows, The wire shows the views of both
the cops, the criminals. If you watch more into the show into the other
seasons you will find that it also gets into politics which is also a
very interesting point of view.<br /><br />This television series depicts the deterioration of a city. It shows
how bad the city has gotten to send a message that something must be
done. This show really hits home to many Baltimore natives whether they
are a cop or a kid from the corner. I haven&#39;t seen another show strive
as much as this one to accomplish such realism. With the help of Ed
Burns(An Ex Cop)and the rest of the writers/directors, David Simon has
been able to create one of the best HBO Series/Television Series ever
made.
