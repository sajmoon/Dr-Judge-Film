I just finished watching every episode of the HBO series &quot;The Wire,&quot;
seasons 1-5, and all I can say is WOW. I am so impressed, I don&#39;t even
know where to begin.<br /><br />The actors are so great that you forget you&#39;re watching a TV show; it&#39;s
like a documentary at times. I can&#39;t believe some of the young talent
in this show, it&#39;s ridiculous! Children that show promise, for sure.<br /><br />The direction is superb. It&#39;s not that &#39;shaky, cut to new shot every
five seconds&#39; camera work like some other shows like, say, &quot;Law and
Order.&quot;(Although that is certainly a fine show.) No, &quot;The Wire&quot; is much
more old school. The camera work is fabulous.<br /><br />The writing is so good it&#39;s ridiculous. Every storyline is believable
and masterful. 100% authentic.<br /><br />I have to say, out of all the seasons, my favorite was probably season
one because it focuses so much on street-level drug deals, the corners,
etc... Season two was a little different, focusing more on the shipyard
and the marine terminal. It took me a few episodes to get into it, but
it definitely gave me my favorite finale. Season three was highly
enjoyable, going back to basics so to speak and getting back to the
streets. Season four focuses on a group of kids and an ex-cop who is
struggling with a teaching career. The final season was definitely my
second favorite, tying all the previous seasons together and adding the
media factor to the whole equation.<br /><br />I am proud to say that as a 25+ year Baltimore resident and native of
Charm City, the best show ever to grace television came out of my
hometown. And I urge anyone who loves great television to pick up this
wonderful series. It will not let you down.<br /><br />10 out of 10, kids.
