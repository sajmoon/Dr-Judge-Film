Wow, just finished the 5 season, 60 show run. I&#39;m going to really miss
these characters which is a testament to the quality of the show. Any
chance of a final fling movie a la FireFly?<br /><br />A gritty series with a different theme each season, the changes keep
your interest whilst the common plot threads roll through each year and
keep you coming back for more.<br /><br />An interesting style that leaves lots untold and has you routing for
the flawed heroes and some anti-heroes too.<br /><br />The Quality of acting is immense and you actually watch some of these
kids grow from boys to men over the 5 year run.<br /><br />One of the few things I&#39;ve ever give a 10/10 for, but I can&#39;t recommend
it highly enough. Do yourself a favour and watch it.
