I have watched all the series so far and am looking for the next one. I
cannot speak too highly of this series. It is so realistic - no
&#39;Hollywood&#39; style pinup boys and girls, no outrageous special effects,
just the depiction of police work as it really happens. Overworked,
often overweight, middle aged men dedicated to their job. Often
divorced, alcoholic (or on a program) sitting behind a desk. either on
the phone or shuffling endless paperwork,as opposed to the car chases
and gunplay that seem to dominate other TV shows. What amazes me is the
characters. It is sometimes hard to believe that some of the characters
(such as Bubbles and Omar, for example) are actually actors, not street
people. I suppose that is the test of true acting.
