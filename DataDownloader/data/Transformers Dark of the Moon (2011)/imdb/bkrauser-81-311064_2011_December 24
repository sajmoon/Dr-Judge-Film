Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), Lennox (Josh Duhamel), Simmons (John
Turturro) and Epps (Tyrese Gibson) are tossed together yet again in the
third and (hopefully) final installment of the Tranformers franchise.
This time around both the Autobots and the Decepticons are...well...oh
who cares about the plot, it&#x27;s really just an excuse to blow things up.
And things do blow up, get smashed and otherwise destroyed in every way
imaginable within a ridiculously long 154 minutes.<br /><br />While not the worst in the series, &#x22;Dark of the Moon&#x22; is miles away
from the first film (which isn&#x27;t saying much). Just like &#x22;Revenge of
the Fallen&#x22; the film is crammed full of sound and fury, signifying
nothing. New characters both human and robotic crowd the screen many
spewing &#x22;comic relief&#x22; lines that detract from the story. Instead of
Megan Fox they plucked Rosie Huntington-Whiteley out of Victoria
Secrets to play Michael Bay&#x27;s required T&#x26;A; the results are most
unfortunate.<br /><br />Whether you&#x27;re a huge unwavering fan of the &#x22;Transformers&#x22; movie
franchise or a detractor their is one thing I&#x27;m sure we can all agree;
this series has stagnated. How many times have we already seen Sam come
a couple milliseconds from death, another evil metallic monolith trying
to take over the world or Optimus Prime kicking the gears of yet
another robotic bad guy. We&#x27;ve all seen it before and as a result this
film is just a retread of the same old tired themes told in the exact
same slapdash way. The only difference is its longer.
