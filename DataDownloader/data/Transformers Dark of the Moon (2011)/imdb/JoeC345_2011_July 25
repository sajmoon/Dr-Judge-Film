Here&#x27;s the thing, you don&#x27;t go into a movie like this expecting to see
&#x22;The Kings Speech&#x22; because you will be horribly disappointed if you set
that kind of standard for a summer blockbuster movie. It recent years I
have stop reading a lot of critics because it seems they have forgotten
sometimes you just need to not analyze so much and just sit back and
enjoy the show.<br /><br />Transformers: Dark of the Moon is the third movie installment in this
franchise and surprisingly, almost as good as the first one. After
&#x22;Revenge of the Fallen&#x22; it seemed this franchise was doomed, and I
didn&#x27;t want to see this one at first but a few buddies informed me it
was actually good, so I decided to give it a chance.<br /><br />A half hour in or so it seemed this movie wasn&#x27;t going anywhere and the
plot seemed as thin as before but then it all starts up. To say this is
an action movie is almost an understatement, since during the last hour
or so it&#x27;s hard to find a scene where something is not blowing up or
crashing or being shot at. However contrary to what other critics have
said it wasn&#x27;t an insult to the ears.<br /><br />The plot that can be a little hard to follow at times with all the
mindless violence, but it doesn&#x27;t really matter it&#x27;s not that
complicated. Even though I will say this time the plot is far more fun
to watch and easier to understand then the convoluted &#x22;Revenge of the
Fallen&#x22;.<br /><br />I would like to talk about the acting in this movie but there really
isn&#x27;t any. It&#x27;s hard to act while literally everything is blowing up
around you and people just keep yelling things. There are some nice
one-liners though.<br /><br />As a director Michael Bay is known for mindless action movies and
sometimes he fails and sometimes as with this one he succeeds. Some of
the statements above may seem to be denouncing this film but there
really not, since like I said at the beginning you just have to sit
back and enjoy the show.<br /><br />Side note: I&#x27;ve seen 3 movies in the last couple weeks which is more
movies that I&#x27;ve seen in theaters in months. 2 of which I saw in 3D
(Captain America and the last Harry Potter movie). I didn&#x27;t feel like
spending the extra money to see this in 3D and I think I made the wise
choice. The Colors seemed brighter and even thought this is the lesser
of the 3 movies I would almost want to say I had a better experience in
this one.
