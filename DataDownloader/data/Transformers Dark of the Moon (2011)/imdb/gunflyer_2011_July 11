A LOT of people have really gone off the deep end with their critical
reviews. Honestly, Dark of the moon, and all the Transformers movies
for that matter could have been so much more, so much better. There&#x27;s
no denying that at all! At this point though, we knew what to expect
walking in, I knew what to expect walking in. Honestly, I liked this
movie. I enjoyed the big dumb action, because even as bad as the
Transformers movies have gotten, they still have giant robot wars, and
for me, that trumps movies about Boy Wizards or typical action films.
What is important is that there isn&#x27;t just a marginal improvement over
revenge of the fallen in this movie, there is a huge improvement over
that film. The story is far better, the characters have more to do. The
ONLY real complaint I can agree with is that there needed to be some
more scenes removed from this film. Seriously, this movie could have
done with 15-20 minutes worth of editing.<br /><br />When the problem in your movie amounts to a lack of editing, I have
really got to ask about the basis for all the complaining. A lot of
people also apparently take Star Trek too seriously because of a
certain line Leonard Nimoy as Sentinel Prime said in this film. Guys,
I&#x27;m like a hardcore Trekkie, and even I don&#x27;t care! Star Trek is great,
but to take it that seriously, like even WAY more seriously than I do
is complete bullshit.<br /><br />So no, I&#x27;m not going to sit here and tell you that Transformers Dark of
the moon didn&#x27;t have problems, it did, but in my opinion the faults
from ROTF have improved SO much in this movie that any problems can be
easily overlooked in my opinion.<br /><br />Dark of the moon is an enjoyable action film, and to be fair it&#x27;s not
nearly as bad as some overwrought critics have said it is.
