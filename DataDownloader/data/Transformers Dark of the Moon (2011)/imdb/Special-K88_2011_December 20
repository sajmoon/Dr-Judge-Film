Despite all of his past heroic deeds, and the support and affection of
his new girlfriend, Sam Witwicky just can&#x27;t seem to get any
appreciation or even find a job. Meanwhile, a high-tech Cybertronian
spacecraft has been discovered on the moon and the intrepid
Autobots&#x97;still acting as the unofficial protectors of Earth&#x97;are
determined to try and stop the evil Decepticons from acquiring it&#x85;or
something. Story is confusing, action scenes are hollow, characters are
one-dimensional, the special effects have now grown old, and to make
matters worse it goes on forever. An overlong, overblown sequel that&#x27;s
sure to find its target audience. *&#xBD;
