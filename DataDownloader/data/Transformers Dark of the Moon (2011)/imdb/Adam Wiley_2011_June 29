I went into this film not knowing what to expect. I was shocked at how
good this film was. It has everything. Good acting, amazing CG, awesome
fight sequences and hilarious humor!<br /><br />The past two Transformers movies had average acting. This one was above
average acting. Getting rid of Megan Fox was an improvement. Shia
Labeouf does something right in this film with his acting. I will admit
he is not the best actor, and he can ruin the film he&#x27;s in, but this
time his acting is surprisingly good. Newcomer to the film Rosie
Huntington-Whiteley does an amazing job. Way better than Megan Fox.
Josh Duhamel acting is above par too. John Malkovich also makes an
appearance in the film too. Ken Jeong (Hangover) also makes an
appearance. Both are hilarious with their screen time. Patrick Dempsey
is another new character in the film. His acting is spot on. The voice
acting is especially good.<br /><br />The CG is still spectacular. Everything looked real, especially the
robots. The 3D brings everything to life. I&#x27;ve notice that 3D makes CG
look a lot better. I was amazed at the attention to detail with the CG.
I could tell hard work went into the computer graphics.<br /><br />The fights were not a disappointment. Optimus Prime was still a bad a**
fighter. The slow motion sequences were timed perfectly. The fighting
robots never get old. Optimus was a show stealer in all the fights he
was in. The ending fight sequence will be stuck in my head for the next
couple weeks!<br /><br />Last but not least the humor. There was a perfect amount of humor in
this film. I was relieved that the humor wasn&#x27;t like the humor in
Revenge of the Fallen. I got tired of the sexual humor being the only
humor in the second Transformers. The humor in my opinion was much more
funny. Definitely more laugh out loud moments.<br /><br />Forget about the last movie, forget about the first movie. This one is
by far the best installment in the whole trilogy. This movie had not
one dull moment. It has the perfect combination of humor, action and
dialog! It&#x27;s a must see this summer!
