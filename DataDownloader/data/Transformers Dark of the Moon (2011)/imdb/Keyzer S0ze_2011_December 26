After about an hour or so, I got too tired of watching messy metal
parts, explosions, clich&#xE9;s and boring dialogs, that I chose to stop
watching the bluray &#x26; spend my valuable time by having a nap instead.
At least, my dream was more understandable. After reading similar
previous reviews, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t waste more time on it.<br /><br />I should have got the hint that the movie editing is so poor right at
the beginning, when they used real footage of JFK turning his head 3
times for 1 short scene. The rest of the movie (that I watched) suffer
the same from poor effort of editing that make the movie unpleasant to
watch.<br /><br />Editing aside, the story is also weak. If human have to be involved in
a robot war, at least make them interesting or appear useful to the
story. Neither important reasons are ticked here. Alas, showing more
robots is not helping the situation either. Our eyes and brain have to
suffer trying to comprehend what&#x27;s really going on. Majority of the
bots are greyish silver, on every single fight scenes, you have to
watch closely to know which side is winning, Decepticon or Autobots?
The robot consist of small and messy metal pieces that I can no longer
think, imagine or care which part of their body transformed from what
part of vehicle. The metal beard and few strains of metal hair are
cringe-worthy. We desperately need a reboot of this franchise. Just
like what they did to Batman. The next people making Transformers
should just use Michael Bay&#x27;s versions as case studies. Just do all the
opposites and the movie will mostly be better already.
