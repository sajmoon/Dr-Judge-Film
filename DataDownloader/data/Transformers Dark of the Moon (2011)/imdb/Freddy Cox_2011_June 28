This film is certainly an outstanding visual spectacle that boasts some
of the most impressive, fluid and stunning cgi sequences I&#x27;ve ever
seen. The photography is fantastic and the 3d technology is used
effectively to create stunning, visually amazing scenes. However, that
is the only aspect of the film that I believe deserves merit at all. <br /><br />Despite the continuous action, destruction and battles, I found this
film to be extremely boring, and the final battle, which claimed the
last hour of the film was far too long and drawn out and it greatly
prevented me from appreciating the visual spectacle that is the final
battle as it&#x27;s so long it becomes tedious and I couldn&#x27;t wait for it to
end. <br /><br />The extensive use of cgi action scenes was what ruined the film for me,
and although I never fully agree with the typical view that modern
films have too much cgi and effects and not enough good story, this
film certainly presented a convincing case that the above statement is
true. As there is so much shooting, exploding and fighting in this film
there is relatively little time for dialogue, which was largely, poorly
written, and full of clich&#xE9;s. <br /><br />Finally, I didn&#x27;t rate the casting of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley or her
performance. She has clearly been chosen for the role for her good
looks and her great sex appeal although I think she shines brighter as
an underwear model than blockbuster film actress. Also, It seems
unbelievable to me that Shia LaBeouf&#x27;s character, although not a bad
looking guy, has been in relationships with 2 characters played by
women who have both topped the annual FHM 100 sexiest women in the
world poll. Rosie has clearly been cast to attract more male viewers,
bring sex appeal that the film didn&#x27;t really need and throughout struck
me as being far out of Shia&#x27;s league.
