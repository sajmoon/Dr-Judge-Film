2012_February 4 
First off i just wanna say that when this film came out. I saw it in
theaters with my Dad and it was just awesome. It topped other movies
like Harry Potter and also Iron Man off and was an awesome film about
robots which i really enjoyed and i pretty much am now a Transformers
fan.<br /><br />The thing that i liked in this film is that Micheal Bay did a good job
directing the film. If it was not for him, None of the Transformers
would have been awesome such as this. But as a director i give him
praise and also respect for being such a good director. So i have to
admit he was even a lot better and also he directed such a great film.<br /><br />The Decepticons want nothing more then the All-Spark cube for the
destruction of our planet. Wanting nothing more then the cube itself.
The Autobots join up to help the government with secret missions. But
Sam Witwicky and his new girlfriend Carly Spencer are going nowhere
when the Decepticons threaten to destroy the earth and with their new
leader Sentinel Prime. It&#x27;s up to Optimus Prime and his friends to save
the world once again from a new threat if it&#x27;s not stopped. Of course
The Ark must be stopped because it&#x27;s technology will destroy the world
and ending all life on it if not stopped.<br /><br />The special effects in this film like Buildings collapsing and of
course the Autobots fighting with the Decepticons is intense. Almost
all the scenes had some perspective to them and a lot of those scenes
were amazing. I enjoyed seeing them as they looked so real. And almost
CGI like.<br /><br />Also Shia Lebouef is a great actor in this film. He expresses and acts
so well that his performance is just unforgettable to watch. And his
Talent amazing, He played recently as Mutt Williams in Indina Jones.
And played as Sam Witwicky in Transformers. Though he does a good job
playing in the Disney TV Show Even Stevens, And of course many more
roles in the film Disturbia, And of course in The Battle of Shaker
Heights. He was just excellent in this film all by himself.<br /><br />Also Megan Fox is replaced by Victoria Secret&#x27;s model and Jason
Statham&#x27;s girlfriend Rosie Huntington-Whitely. Of course her role and
her acting is awesome. But in some scenes she does not act normal like
when she&#x27;s only screaming. She looks great and she is an awesome
actress. But Megan Fox was replaced as in the two other films were she
was still with Sam but was eventually replaced which was nice too.<br /><br />Although this film definitely has some great fight scenes and the
soundtrack that is composed very well i should say is the best. Of
course it&#x27;s not that bad and it sounds a lot better because the music
makes it suspenseful and yet violent. But still the fight scenes are
really violent no matter what you think. This makes the movie a lot
better then it already is.<br /><br />Although the movie is a great film. I would have to say that this is an
action packed film and it&#x27;s a very good one. There are many great funny
scenes in it like where Simmons knocks on the door and a Russian
Doorman says that means goodbye. It surely makes me laugh every time i
see it and the script is very well indeed told and read by the actors
which is also nice. But the fact is that if you are a big Transformers
fan then you have got to see this movie. It&#x27;s all based on the toys and
the TV Show and of course tops it off in my case. This is even better
then Indiana Jones or Iron Man and also is something you have to see to
believe. The story is incredible. The characters stay true and react
perfectly in each situation. And the entire film and acting is
something to be remembered. Everyone is going to love seeing this film
like i did in the theater.<br /><br />So if you are wanting to see a superhero flick then look no furthur
then to Transformers Dark Of The Moon. It surely is an awesome film and
is a great film. It will make you laugh and the director behind it
which is Micheal Bay is surely amazing.
