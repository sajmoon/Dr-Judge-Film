The only positive thing about my experience of watching this film is
that it was at a friends house and as such, cost me nothing...<br /><br />But I&#x27;d still like 154 minutes of my life back! This film is cheesy,
tack and stretches suspension of belief WAY past breaking point. What
pathetically weak storyline there is is a simple rinse and repeat of
the first film but without the novelty of it being new and without an
OUNCE of the charm.<br /><br />This film would be great as a video game where you control the action
but it feels far too much like you&#x27;re just watching a friend playing a
game instead... and doing it badly.
