2012_January 7 
I liked the first film. I didn&#x27;t desperately love it, but I liked it. I
thought that film had some heart and soul in it. I think this sums it
up pretty well: I felt shivers down my bones (I get that easily) when
the Autobots revealed themselves.<br /><br />The 3rd installment is just as bad as the second was. Don&#x27;t pay much
attention to those who say it&#x27;s better - it&#x27;s just as bad but in a
different way. The 2nd was way too packed with action and mindless
scenes where we were supposed to care. The 3rd has much less action,
which should not be a bad thing. However, the lack of action is
replaced by meaningless characters doing, well, pretty much nothing of
any consequence.<br /><br />I&#x27;d just like films like these to have characters with some level of
dignity. Why is John Malkovich such an ass? He&#x27;s like crawling on the
floor ranting something incomprehensibly stupid when seeing the
Autobots. John: Walk in the room, have a look and have some dignity and
grandeur about yourself.<br /><br />A very very poor film indeed. With this budget, what could you have
made... oh my. I give it 3/10 - which 2 points more than some films
have gotten from me, because at least I could watch this one to the end
without falling asleep.
