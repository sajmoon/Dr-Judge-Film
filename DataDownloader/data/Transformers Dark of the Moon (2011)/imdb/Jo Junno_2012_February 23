Just think, some people thought they were disappointed by Transformers
2. If that&#x27;s the case, then wait until they get a load of this thing.
Dark Moon makes TF2 look like Casablanca by comparison.<br /><br />Dark Moon offers nothing new in any way, shape or form. It&#x27;s a
convoluted mess that&#x27;s caught in no man&#x27;s land. It actually takes
itself too seriously yet offers ridiculous action (ridiculous as in
dumb, not as in wild or fun) and even more ridiculous characters. It
wants to be taken seriously but functions in bizarre surroundings with
a foolish plot. Movies like Thor and X-Men worked this year because
they evolved characters, told a smart story and grounded the concept
but still delivered the action. This movie tries to take a similar
approach but it simply can&#x27;t stand on its own as a film. Does silly,
wild but dumb appeal to even the youngest crowds? Maybe it does but the
rest of us want way more in our summer movies.
