&#x22;Transformers: Dark Of The Moon&#x22; is easily the best film in the series,
and there&#x27;s a solid hour-long action sequence in Chicago that uses
everything Bay&#x27;s ever done before, but all blended into one exhausting
push to save one girl in the midst of a war involving two planets. It&#x27;s
the personal story on an apocalyptic scale that Bay loves to try to
tell, and that other guys like Emmerich and Cameron and even Spielberg
love to do. And this is the best version of it that Bay&#x27;s made so far.<br /><br />Let&#x27;s start with this: for the first time since &#x22;Avatar,&#x22; I am going to
recommend that you find the biggest and best 3D theater you can find
and buy yourself a ticket, because &#x22;Transformers: Dark Of The Moon,&#x22;
especially seen in IMAX 3D, is an overwhelming sensory experience. The
sound mix alone is more exciting than anything in the billion-dollar-
bore of &#x22;Pirates 4.&#x22; This is gigantic action we&#x27;ve never seen before,
and Bay&#x27;s reaction to shooting and cutting his film for 3D is to get
better at what he does. It raised his game, and as a result, I feel
like we just saw a dare thrown down by one of Hollywood&#x27;s biggest
action specialists: &#x22;Top this.&#x22;
