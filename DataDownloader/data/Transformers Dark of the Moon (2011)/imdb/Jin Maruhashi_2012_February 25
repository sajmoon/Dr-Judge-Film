&#x22;Transformers: Dark of the Moon&#x22; rockets across the screen on a massive
tank overflowing with adrenaline-filled displays of unprecedented
opportunities to witness countless, mass detonations that are
acrobatically engineered by all automatons; ranging from toy-sized bots
programmed with an electrifying sense of humor to massively serpentine
killing-machines with razor-sharp extensions. This third installment,
unlike the previous ones, uniquely delivers an eye-popping blow with
its functionally entertaining 3D component that launches an unstoppable
missile of explosive fun. Other than the mesmerizing visuals of
jaw-dropping action sequences, &#x22;Transformers: Dark of the Moon&#x22; also
reveals a satisfactory performance from Shia Labeouf and an alluring
female substitute for the role of Sam Witwicky&#x27;s girlfriend, fulfilled
by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. It is worth mentioning, however, the
rusty ignition engendered by the tediously damaging first few scenes
and seemingly cloned storyline of saving humanity from &#x22;Decepticonic&#x22;
pressures that nearly draw the action-packed momentum to a screeching
halt. Thankfully, these opposing forces are counteracted by the
dazzling power of the unforgettably eruptive robot clashes. In short,
Michael Bay successfully assembles the necessary parts to energize a
state-of-the-art machine known for its visual effects.
