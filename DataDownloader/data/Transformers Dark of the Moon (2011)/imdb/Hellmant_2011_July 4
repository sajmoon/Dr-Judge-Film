&#x27;TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON&#x27;: Four Stars (Out of Five) <br /><br />The third chapter in director Michael Bay&#x27;s immensely popular super
robot franchise, based on the popular 80&#x27;s cartoon show and Hasbro toy
series. Shia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, John Turturro, Kevin
Dunn, Julie White and most of the rest of the cast are back. With one
obvious exception of course; Megan Fox. Due to conflict with the film&#x27;s
producers (Bay and Steven Spielberg) Fox was fired from the project.
She&#x27;s been replaced by popular Victoria&#x27;s Secret&#x27;s model Rosie
Huntington Whiteley (who has worked with Bay before on a 2009
Victoria&#x27;s Secret commercial). Also new to this film are John
Malkovich, Frances McDormand, Patrick Dempsey, Ken Jeong and others.
Ehren Kruger (who co-wrote the last installment) returns as the sole
scriptwriter this time around. The film is once again (like all of
Bay&#x27;s films) loud, obnoxious and relentlessly in your face. It&#x27;s also a
lot of fun if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing.<br /><br />This adventure begins in 1961 while the Autobot&#x27;s and Deceptions still
wage war on their home planet of Cybertron. An aging Autobot known as
Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy, who also voiced the character
Galvatron in &#x27;THE TRANSFORMERS: THE MOVIE&#x27; 1986 animated film) escapes
the planet with special teleportation technology called Pillars that
could end the war for good. He crash lands on the moon and has been
wrecked there ever since. When Optimus Prime (once again voiced by the
legendary voice actor Peter Cullen) learns that the U.S. government has
known about Sentinel&#x27;s whereabouts and the Pillars for some time he
becomes extremely angry and makes it his mission to bring Sentinel home
to Earth. The Decepticons meanwhile lay in wait, waiting for the
appropriate time to strike and seize control of the Pillars. Sam
Witwicky (LaBeouf reprising his most famous role) at the same time is
struggling with unemployment (even though he helped save the world
twice and earned a medal from President Obama) and feelings of
inadequacy while trying to impress his new super hot girlfriend Carly
(Huntington-Whiteley).<br /><br />The story is once again pretty simple but things still seem to get very
convoluted and hard to follow (in classic Michael Bay fashion). The
film always moves at breakneck speeds regardless of what&#x27;s going on
(whether it&#x27;s a simple dialogue scene or an elaborate action
spectacle). It jumps from slapstick comedy to emotional drama to
explosive action, without a moment&#x27;s pause, and back again
(constantly). The whole thing becomes very exhausting (like all of
Bay&#x27;s films) and you really need some strong caffeine or some kind of
drug (whatever LaBeouf is on) to keep up with it. This kind of material
can definitely leave the viewer with a severe headache if they&#x27;re not
in the right mindset. With that said the movie is still a heck of a lot
of fun and you get far more than your money&#x27;s worth (there&#x27;s so much
going on). The scam is that it takes you three or four times of seeing
the film just to process it all. The action scenes are breathtaking,
the 3D visuals are arguably the best since &#x27;AVATAR&#x27; and the comedy for
the most part is very funny. The script is a complete mess but that&#x27;s
not really important with this type of film. LaBeouf&#x27;s shtick is
getting a little old but for me it still works. The guy has so much
energy and is still hilarious in the right role (and Witwicky is the
perfect showcase for LaBeouf&#x27;s comedic and improvisational talents).
Some people hate the parent characters but in my opinion Kevin Dunn and
Julie White are always scene stealers in these films.
Huntington-Whitely does a good job of looking extremely glamorous and
beautiful (and that&#x27;s all she really has to do) but I still prefer
Megan Fox (or anyone more real). Bay&#x27;s directing is once again Bay&#x27;s
directing; you either love it or hate it. I personally love it. Seeing
one of his films is a very unique experience and it is almost like
being on drugs in a way. It&#x27;s mind-blowing! I love creative independent
films made for next to nothing but I also love big visually
exploitative films (made on budgets of 2 to 300 million dollars). I
think there&#x27;s room for both types of film-making in the marketplace and
one style doesn&#x27;t hurt the other. They can co-exist! If you enjoy these
types of films you&#x27;ll definitely enjoy this one too.<br /><br />Watch our review show &#x27;MOVIE TALK&#x27; at:
