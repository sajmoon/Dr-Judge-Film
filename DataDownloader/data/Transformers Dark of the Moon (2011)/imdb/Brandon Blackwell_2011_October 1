The Autobots learn of a Cybertronian spacecraft hidden on the Moon, and
race against the Decepticons to reach it and to learn its secrets.<br /><br />To start things off, I watched this flick in 3D. Then re-watched it the
last weekend. And came here to make my review. Firsts things first,
this movie is a huge improvement from Revenge of the Fallen. It has
some freaking AMAZING special effects which beats the first two and it
has the confidence to step up to the first. But fails. Although I
really believed this was a good movie, I must admit it was stupid at
times and I really wished they took out those cheesy parts they put in
for the kids. Such as those tiny little robots. It worked with the
first but didn&#x27;t for this one. This was supposed to be a battle epic,
which is turned out to be, but had those scenes that gave you a smack
in the face. But from all those flaws, it turned out to be much better
than Revenge of the Fallen and came close to the first one. This film
is purely popcorn fun. 7/10.
