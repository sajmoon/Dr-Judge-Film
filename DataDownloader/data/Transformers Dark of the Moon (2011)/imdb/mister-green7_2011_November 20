I am puzzled as to how this movie can score a 6 out of 10 (at time of
my writing). I mean this is proof that Bay has paid people to put up
fake reviews for his movie, or maybe Bay himself is pressing the IMDb
high ratings button HAHA hey you never know! Anyways, Bay, also known
as Michael &#x27;oh-look-at-meee&#x27; Bay - needs a lot of supervision when
making movies. He can shoot a car chase and military paraphernalia, but
other than that, nothing else. I was traumatised as a kid way back in
1986 when I watched Optimus and his old skool Autobot buddies get
killed in The Movie; sadly to say I am once again traumatised watching
this Bayhem of a Transformers franchise. I am slowly recovering knowing
the Bayhem trilogy has ended. This Bayhem franchise reminds me of when
Batman was with Clooney and Kilmer; so hopefully the next reboot will
be how Nolan did to the Batman franchise. Transformers Begins perhaps.
Dark Robot? Cybertron Royale. You get the drift....
