Well, lets get a quick look at the film. Explosions, CGI, 3D and after
these comes everything else. These three things is the main reason why
one should watch Transformers: Dark of the Moon. We all know who Mr.
Bay is and what his movies are famous for: explosions, explosions,
explosions and destruction, destruction, destruction. Plot has never
been his strongest feature, but hey, and i am totally honest here, it
works well enough, at least for me. All i wanted to see was a typical
Michael Bay movie, something like Armageddon or the first Transformers,
and what i got was a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />So, before watching the movie its probably not a sin to say that we
were certain of one thing: it couldn&#x27;t have been worse than Revenge of
the Fallen, which, lets be honest, was pretty atrocious. This time
we&#x27;ve got plot linked to Moon and Apollo 11, which was clever and
worked well for the movie, decepticons taking over the world and
turning Chicago into something we&#x27;re used to see in The Terminator
movies and autobots with their human allies resisting them. Oh, and
what we don&#x27;t have is Megan Fox. Thank God for that. The new female
lead, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has one task: be pretty and well its
safe to say that she succeeds at it, no one expects her to deliver an
award-winning performance, but she did really good (it&#x27;s her first film
by the way) and she fits in the movie and with Sam very well. <br /><br />Anyway, the film is much bigger and more serious than the previous
ones. This time we&#x27;ve got emotion and character, which maybe has
something to do with, again having Steve Jablonsky and Linkin Park for
soundtrack. Iridescent which is played at some points creates an
excellent aura. All this decepticon destruction and &#x22;drawing the bigger
picture&#x22; motive provides us with more seriousness and depth.<br /><br />So all in all, Transformers: Dark of the Moon was an awesome watch. It
could be for anyone, if only one goes to watch it for the right reasons
(needlessly to say explosions, CGI and 3D). We&#x27;ve got fast pace, a lot
of visuals, romance, a lot of mayhem and well, a moral (presented
heavily with clich&#xE9;s but, hey, no harm). All of which are vital
components for a solid summer blockbuster and a clear head to define
Transformers as something more than meets the eye. Just sit back and
expect a fun and adventurous ride and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.
