First of all, I&#x27;m 34 years old and as a kid I was a huge Transformers
TV show fan. Back in 2007 when they said there will be a transformers
film I was kind of excited, I loved the idea. When I went to see the
movies I was very very very disappointed. The robots look nothing like
the cartoon, the story was different, Megatron&#x27;s voice was different,
Shia LaBeouf was awful - It was a bad movie. <br /><br />OK, sometimes things can get better, I went to see the second one. By
all means those were 2 hours of my life I&#x27;ll never get back.
Transformers 2 was a total disaster. No plot whatsoever, Megan Fox&#x27;s
body was being thrown on us for the film to succeed, about a million
goofs and mistakes regarding &#x22;the big war in Egypt&#x22; - (Believe me, I
know, I&#x27;m an Egyptian).<br /><br />I thought of giving Mr.Bay a last chance. I went to the movie with very
low expectations and then....WOW. By far the best movie of the trilogy.
It had a nice story, some twists, AMAZING CGI - no more shaky cameras,
you can now witness every fight in clear detail. The music was
fantastic (although ripped off, a little mix between The Dark Knight
and Inception). Shia LaBeouf surprisingly was actually good. The movie
is a summer blockbuster, it&#x27;s a two and a half hour thrilling action
ride with a lot of scenes that will make you drop your jaw and bite
your fingernails. Why do critics hate it? Have no Idea. Please people
don&#x27;t talk about plot holes and wrong scientific facts, this is a movie
about talking robots that have feelings, so I think we&#x27;re already past
the scientific and logical point! I gave this an 8 because I had to
drop 2 points for the movie&#x27;s biggest fault - Miss &#x22;lips&#x22; Rosie - She
can&#x27;t act, I didn&#x27;t give a damn about her and to be honest, she is NOT
hot. Megan was totally HOT. <br /><br />Don&#x27;t wait to rent the DVD. You will not waste your money, if you like
action, thrilling scenes, have an ear to music and most of all - like
the Transformers, go see it.
