Shia LaBeouf is now attempting to find a career after college
graduation with little luck. However, all is not so dark and bleak as
he has found a new love (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) and the world
appears safe from those dreaded Decepticons. But things can change
quickly as an Autobot spacecraft which was first discovered in the
1960s, becomes a point of interest for all robotic protagonists and
antagonists involved. &#x22;Transformers: Dark of the Moon&#x22; sizzles in its
set-up and its plot development early with a vibrant energy and
excitement from its highly likable cast (which even includes stand-outs
like Patrick Dempsey, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, and Ken
Jeong), but is steadily destroyed by the titled characters. As the
clock ticks and the running time becomes astronomical (running nearly
160 minutes) the movie begins to lose its wheels with an unending
finale which literally takes up about an hour of the movie&#x27;s running
time. The &#x22;Transformers&#x22; series continues to deliver what it
promises---sleek cars, sleeker women, and tons of chaotic noise and
visuals. In the end though, the complexities of the human performers
always seem to take a backseat to the titled weapons of mass
destruction. Director Michael Bay seems to overlook and sacrifice
legitimate premises and possibly interesting outcomes in favor of
confusing and over-wrought visual effects which ultimately do very
little to advance the effectiveness which potentially could have
developed within. Sometimes less is more and I do not think it could be
more prevalent, cinematically speaking, than in this particular movie
franchise. 2.5 out of 5 stars.
