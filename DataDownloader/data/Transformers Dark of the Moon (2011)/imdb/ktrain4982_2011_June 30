2011_June 30 
This movie will be the best movie of the summer and most likely the
best 3rd movie in a trilogy. It was perfect. I was on the edge of my
seat throughout the movie, excited, shocked, amazed, I even had a few
tears in my eyes! Transformers 3 has everything a good movie should
have. Action, comedy, a few little heart felt moments... Well Maybe
just for me but it was perfect. 10 out of 10!! Go see this movie. I&#x27;m
going to see it again tomorrow, that&#x27;s how good it was. I just wish it
would never end. I need more Transformers. <br /><br />On the other side of thing though, I don&#x27;t think this counts as a
spoiler or anything but a few autobots weren&#x27;t even in this movie,
maybe they were killed between movies, I don&#x27;t know. Mudflap and Skids
were the comical ones and now R.C had to fill that roll. And Jolt is
missing, the character that put the wings and guns on Optimus in
Revenge of the Fallen. How could he not be in it? But new characters
make up for it all. And don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all action, there is a lot of
important conversations and what not, not just robots running around.
