Well the first film was a blast. I loved it so much that I bought a
BluRay version to watch it in HD.<br /><br />The second was a terrible mess and ridiculous plot.<br /><br />Now, the third tried to redeem itself from the terrible fall of the
second film...however although surpasses the second, is still light
years away from being in par with the very first film. There are many
scenes that are so predictable and Autobots are ALWAYS there in time.
Apart from amazing visual effects and a higher epic Decepticon ambition
to conquer the world as well as Sam&#x27;s new love interest, the story is
pretty much the same. It is fun at times, but the somewhat potential
scenes are ruined by pure clich&#xE9;s of Autobot rescues.
