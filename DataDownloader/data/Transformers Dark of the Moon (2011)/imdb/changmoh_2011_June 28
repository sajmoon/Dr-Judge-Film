It&#x27;s &#x27;Bayhem&#x27; time again - and this time around demolition king Michael
Bay presents his trademark &#x27;Six-C&#x27;s&#x27; in glorious 3D! In case you don&#x27;t
know, the six &#x27;Cs&#x27; are: chases, clashes, crashes, combustions, carnage
and cleavage. Spread over a bottom-numbing two-and-a-half hours,
&#x22;Transformers: Dark Of The Moon&#x22; can also induce mental and metal
fatigue, especially with the clanging robots smashing one another - and
the whole exercise making little sense.<br /><br />Technologically, however, &#x22;Dark Of The Moon&#x22; is Bay&#x27;s best work so far
- and action fans looking to be awed by scenes of massive mayhem and
destruction in 3D should be satisfied. Story-wise, this one is better
than &#x22;Revenge Of The Fallen&#x22;, but not as fun and emotionally-connecting
as the first.<br /><br />The film opens with a flashback to the Sixties Apollo landing mission
where history is rewritten (by Ehren Kruger) to incorporate the
cover-up of an alien spaceship crashing on the moon. That spaceship, of
course, is one of the remains of the epic battles between the Autobots
and the Decepticons, and its &#x27;discovery&#x27; sparks off another war that
threatens to destroy planet Earth. Or at least the face of Chicago as
we know it.<br /><br />On the human level, we find that Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) has traded
in his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) for a newer model (a Victoria
Secret one, to be exact) in the shape of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as
Carly). Sam is being offered a job by Bruce Brazos (John Malkovich) but
we soon learn that Carly&#x27;s boss Dylan (Patrick Dempsey) may be up to no
good. Then, when the conflict between the Autobots and Decepticons hots
up, Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Sergeant Epps (Tyrese Gibson) of
the elite Government squad NEST are summarily called into action.<br /><br />We get lulled into believing that there may somehow be an intelligent
plot coming from the conspiracy of the NASA lunar-landing cover-up
which also involves the Russian space program and Chernobyl. These turn
out to be just an exercise in &#x27;historical name-dropping&#x27; to spur our
interest before we get to the demolition derby created by the
Transformers. Indeed, some of the robots seem to emote better that the
live cast. Cybertron leader Sentinel Prime, for example, is even
designed to look like Leonard Nimoy (who provides its voice), complete
with stuff that looks like beard. Again, the problems of the previous
installments recur - like the confusion between the good and bad robots
in the clashes.<br /><br />Unlike the first two movies, there are no more gags about the shock of
humans interacting with the mechanical &#x27;bots. Bay, however, insists on
some comic sequences and he has hired Ken Jeong to do his in-your-face
shtick as Jerry Wang. John Turturro reprises his role as former FBI
agent Simmons but this time around, Turturro finds it fit to clown
around with his role. The most striking inclusion to the cast is Rosie
Huntington-Whiteley as Sam&#x27;s love interest. However, with limited
acting talent, she provides only eye-candy and beside her, Megan Fox
would look like an Oscar-caliber actress.<br /><br />Like the first &#x22;Transformers&#x22;, this one is also a live-action cartoon
on a grand scale. Scenes of Chicago buildings being toppled and
destroyed can be as spectacular and brain-numbing as those of September
11; and the wing-suit flying sequences are breath-taking. Indeed, these
are what most of Michael Bay&#x27;s fans pay for and they will not be
disappointed. The only problem for me is that Bay prolongs and repeats
the robotic clash sequences to the point of being self-indulgent.
Technically brilliant and visually arresting, &#x22;Dark Of The Moon&#x22; lacks
heart and soul. (limchangmoh.blogspot.com)
