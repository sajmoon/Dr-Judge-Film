Transformers: Dark of the Moon was a really great film, and so far my
favorite out of the three made so far. This is also the first film I
watched in real D 3D and I was very impressed, there were some moments
when the 3D became a headache because the scenes were so flashy and
switched so fast my eyes/brain couldn&#x27;t comprehend it, otherwise I
believe the story line was outstanding, and they really do a good job
of making the Transformers films seem like a true series line by
mentioning events from the previous films. The humor was really great,
I laughed a lot during this film, and I loved that I really felt in the
action while watching this in 3D. This movie was like 3 hours but It is
well worth watching. I would recommend this to anyone.
