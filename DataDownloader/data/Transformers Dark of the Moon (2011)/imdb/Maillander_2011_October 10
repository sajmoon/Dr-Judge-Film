I have to say that I expected more from the ending (?) of the trilogy.
&#x3A4;he directors had made a good background with the first two movies and
&#x399; had great expectations for this one. I would understand the
disappointment if the movie was low-budget, but it wasn&#x27;t. It was full
to the brim with cgi action scenes and special effects, the action was
almost constant and yet not satisfying. The only kind of action scenes
I can remember are with with things collapsing, people falling, and Sam
(Shia LaBeouf) shouting his girlfriend&#x27;s name. The autobots where
absent in the majority of the film, and there were almost no fight
scenes involving the transformers. Even the last battle, which we&#x27;ve
been waiting for the entire film, lasted for less than 5 minutes, and
it wasn&#x27;t so epic after all. The creators also tried to make Sam look
tougher in the third movie, which doesn&#x27;t suit him. Rosie
Huntington-Whiteley as the new girl was beautiful (too beautiful for
Sam to be having her from the beginning of the film actually), but
that&#x27;s as far as it goes. Furthermore, they put more characters to make
the script funnier (Malcovich, Frances McDormand, and the two little
autobots) but they overdid it and the result was kind of childish. To
sum up, I just believe that they could have put all this budget to
better use.
