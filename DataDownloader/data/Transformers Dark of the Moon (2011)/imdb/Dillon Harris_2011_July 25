Transformers: Dark Of The Moon,is a great movie (although a terrible
title),I think it deserves a better rating,a I also found it an
improvement from Transformers:Revenge Of The Fallen,although I missed
Megan Fox as she was absent for the movie,but she got a good
replacement,Rosie Huntington-Whitely as Carly Spencer.<br /><br />Sam and The Autobots learn of a spacecraft hidden on the Moon that was
hidden for years,the Autobots fight against the Decepticons to find it
and learn its secrets.<br /><br />****/***** <br /><br />-DILLOPN HARRIS
