Note - A very typical Michael Bay film. IF you are not used to this
kind of films, this is what you need to do....!!!<br /><br />- You need to leave behind expectations of movies like Citizen Kane or
Independence Day, <br /><br />- Leave your brains back to your rooms,...because then, you will be so
blank, giving you enough space to process such junky stuff,...!!!<br /><br />- Then sit back relax, grab a pop-corn and soda and JUST ENJOY,...!!!
Trust me you will enjoy,...:D<br /><br />And no doubt this film is year&#x27;s best Action and Alien Invasion movie
so far...as Battle Los Angeles was such a waste.<br /><br />After watching this film, trust me I relives 3 things, a best
Transformer film, a good alien invasion movie and Crysis 2 (one of the
best FPS and alien invasion game so far, released early this year).<br /><br />(And last but not the least,...i see people making bad out of context
critique regarding this movie,...i mean HELLO!!!,...first look at the
scope, content, context and category of this film...then say it...!!!)
