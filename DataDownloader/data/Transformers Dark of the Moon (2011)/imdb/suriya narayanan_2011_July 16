One of the most awaited movies of this year, and its not a
disappointment as its prequel. Still they haven&#x27;t had much to tell us
as a story though. But the way they did the screenplay is appreciable.
The movie is a good entertainer and the music is something good, but it
reminds me of inception&#x27;s and requiem for a dream. The best thing abt
this movie is the stunning visual effects. I really haven&#x27;t enjoyed the
visual effects of any other movies lately (after avatar and inception).<br /><br />The characters are just to support this machine movie. The actress of
the movie (though sexy and beautiful) is such a pain in the back, for
the movie and at times it makes the scenes, a dark comedy. Watchable
entertainer just for the superb CG effects.
