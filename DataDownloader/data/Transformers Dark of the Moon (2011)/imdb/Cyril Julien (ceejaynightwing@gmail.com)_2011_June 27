There is a simple rule to knowing if its worth going to see this film..<br /><br />If you enjoyed the first film regardless of what you thought of the
dubious second movie, then get your damn tickets! If you hated both
movies then stay the hell away because there will be nothing new for
you this time around.<br /><br />Quite simply this is the most outstanding action flick you&#x27;re likely to
see this year let alone this summer and it&#x27;s a successful return to
what they managed to deliver with the first movie. Make no mistake
about the toilet humour, sometimes screwball acting and silly jokes.
That stuff is still very evident but unlike the second movie where it
went spiralling out of control and dominated the picture, here it is
kept firmly on a leach. In fact it is very much a film of two halves,
the first half has an even mix of humour an action but it doesn&#x27;t go
too over the top to the point where we see robots doing embarrassing
things like peeing or showing their balls etc, and there is a lot of
human death unlike the other films. You see the innocent getting wiped
out not just building collapsing and explosions. The second half is
very much a tour de force of action scenes that are either nail biting
or breath taking, not much letting up once it starts going and the
finale is very satisfying! This is no movie with an agenda to deliver
some life changing tale, it makes no attempt to equal the Bard with its
narrative or plot. This is a movie based on popular toys for boys.
Expect that much and you will be entertained because they actually set
up this movie with a very clever conspiracy theory based on the NASA
missions to the moon and weave that into the roots of the franchise.
Shia Lebeouf is without his sidekick for the last two movies in Megan
Fox but finds a more than worthy successor in supermodel Rosie
Huntington Whiteley who plays a part that&#x27;s very difficult to see Megan
ever pulling off. Sure these girls are meant for mostly eye candy but
where Megan&#x27;s hot lipstick and deep pencilled eyebrowed, glam-pornstar
look got more slutty with each picture, Rosie&#x27;s supermodel grace and
fine English accented charm brings more class than candy. Sorry Megan
fans but no way would she pull of a semi-rich bitch who&#x27;s been to
finishing school and back! In fact her part is essential in the few
well executed plot twists and deceptions this movie presents that were
never as potent in its predecessors.<br /><br />All this builds up to last hour of back to back action sequences of
spectacle, stealth, barbaric violence and utter heroics that will
please the masses and outrage the critics who can never assess these
kind of movie based on what they aim to be rather than what they don&#x27;t!
Transformers Dark of the Moon delivers a picture worthy of ending any
action series, this is what makes buying a movie box set on home video
worth parting with the cash even when one of the films is totally duff.
Bay&#x27;s even managed to show the industry how to use 3D with easily the
best 3D presentation since Avatar. Whoever takes over this franchise
has a mighty jump to make because Michael Bay has placed the bar pretty
damn high!
