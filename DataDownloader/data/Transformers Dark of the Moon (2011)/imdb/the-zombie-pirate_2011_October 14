What can I say other than this movie is mediocre at best? There is some
exciting action and I found myself engaged enough to want to see the
outcome of the struggle. Out of place one liners that made no sense
broke my interest in the story which gave me time to think about how
goofy this movie is. I am not concerned about continuity with the first
two movies (I never saw the first and the second is just as forgettable
as this one will be). The Sam character should never be given words
because the writers have no clue how to develop a character. I can
suspend my disbelief for giant mechanical extra terrestrial life and
even an unlikely hero, but not for the painful dialogue that was
supposed to flesh out the latter. I am not looking for poetry, but
something that will not make me groan. Pairing Sam with a pretty woman
largely for exploitation also cheapens what could have been a much
better action movie. Leave out the fan service and focus on the story.
Transformers has potential to be good grown up entertainment. Like
Batman, I hope that somebody else tries to recreate the characters one
day. Over all, for $1.02 rental, I enjoyed about ninety-nine cents of
it. Michael Bay et al may keep the change.
