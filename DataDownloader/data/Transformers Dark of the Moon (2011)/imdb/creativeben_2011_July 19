I was expecting another terrible Transformers film due to the negative
reviews and bad word of mouth however I was pleasantly surprised. The
thing that made this film work was that it actually had a plot and the
fighting had some reason, unlike the second one. I loved the whole
involvement of the moon and space adventure. Some of the action
sequences were immense, the stunts were amazing, out of this world. The
action was really fun and kept you watching right till the end. Don&#x27;t
expect Oscar worthy acting or scriptwriting but since when does an
action film have real substance in acting, not a bad thing but just
fact. The new girl was OK, however by her character there were some
moments where women were painted in a negative light. Also there were
some glitches in the language which was not appropriate and also the
couple of sexual references were inappropriate, not explicit but
heavily implicated. This tainted the quality of the film and was
unnecessary however the overall conclusion is that &#x22;Transformers: Dark
of the Moon&#x22; is a great fun action adventure with killer moves and a
decent plot.
