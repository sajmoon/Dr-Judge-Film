This is this time when Michael Bay have made a excellent film,after 2
great parts he have made a masterpiece. Yes,a masterpiece is laugh when
it should be,it is dark and emotional when it should be and it is
AWESOME when it should be. Of course first 1:30 out of 2:30 isn&#x27;t so so
epic,of course we have battles,action scenes but in this first 1:30
mins action is on second plan,but the final 1h (SPOILER*it starts with
start of destroying city at night END OF SPOILER*) is such an amazing
job of computers and first time you can really felt emotional on
Michael Bay film,good work! Seriously watch this movie it has great
effects,shots,music,plot (of course it&#x27;s not a great plot but it&#x27;s
great TRANSFORMERS plot) and i don&#x27;t understand how someone can say
that this is boring.
