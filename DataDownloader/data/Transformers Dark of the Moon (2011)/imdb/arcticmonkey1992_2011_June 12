I was extremely lucky to go see an advance screening of the morning
over in the USA last week. And after seeing the disaster of the second
movie, i didn&#x27;t really have high hopes for this movie. The trailer made
the film look like it was going to be EXCELLENT!! And after spending
nearly 2 and a half hours in the cinema viewing this movie, i came out
thinking &#x22;wow!!&#x22; Michael bay promised he was going to improve on the
second film and he did it sensationally. The 3D in this movie was
incredible (up there with the 3D effects of avatar). The performances
in this movie was incredible, the special effects were just out of this
world, i don&#x27;t know how Michael bay fits 20+ robots on the screen at
the same time? it&#x27;s just genius. I would recommend this movie to
absolutely everyone, even if you&#x27;re not fans of the series, this movie
is still worth a watch. Amazing summer blockbuster. And Michael bay,
thank you for giving the world such an amazing, and wonderful
masterpiece of a film. 10000000/10
