I&#x27;m going to commit what to many will seem like film geek treason, I
will now connect Michael Bay and Terrence Malick into one theory of
filmmaking.<br /><br />Yep, deal with it.<br /><br />Malick and Bay share one important thing and that is a completely
unabashed tunnelvision for the type of film they want, damn the
naysayers, critics and crowds. They both make movies mainly for
themselves and in truth, there is nothing wrong with that. As an
audience member you need to know going in exactly what you are going to
get. It is the only way to really enjoy anything that falls from the
cameras of these two (and some other notables). With that said, let&#x27;s
dive headlong into the metallic masterpiece of summertime popcorn,
Transformers!<br /><br />Transformers: Dark of the Moon continues the story of Sam Witwicky and
his Autobot friends. While Sam struggles to gain a purpose in life
outside of Decepticon attacks, the Autobots are off helping the
government on secret missions. Then everything is torn apart by the
discovery of the original Autobot escape ship, known as The Ark, and
the captain of that ship, Sentinel Prime. He alone holds the key to
technology that could either help reshape the Transformers home world
or completely destroy ours. The Decepticons, completely aware of this
discovery, make an immediate power play and the war is back, bigger
than ever.<br /><br />Kids buying the Transformer toys today only want one thing, huge robots
in spectacular 3D slow motion destroying each other and every building
in sight. From this narrow viewpoint, Bay delivers in bulk. The highway
fight sequence brought back memories of other high-speed terror scenes
like in Matrix Reloaded and The Island (maybe a little too reminiscent
of that last one according to some eagle eyed movie nerds). Since Bay
actually filmed these scenes in the latest and greatest 3D technology,
it was admittedly pretty amazing to watch. In other scenes, some of the
CGI was so intensely crisp that it actually started popping too far
from the live footage, making it stand out, which ruins a little of the
illusion.<br /><br />So the special effects is where it was at. Big robots, big explosions,
big buildings falling down. Those were the high points.<br /><br />The low points were pretty much everything else.<br /><br />Standing in the center of all the toys-on-roids insanity is Shia
LaBeouf, who in my opinion is a really good actor banking inside really
bad movies. I can&#x27;t fault him for taking parts in some of the biggest
franchises in movie history (Transformers and Indiana Jones) because
the exposure and paycheck are nearly impossible to pass up, but in
terms of showing his skills as an actor, those hefty titles have done
him nothing but a painful disservice. He made his big splash on the
scene in the Disney TV show Even Stevens and then on the big screen in
the Rear Window update, Disturbia. Many people also don&#x27;t remember one
of my personal favorite performances in the Project
Greenlight-sponsored film, The Battle of Shaker Heights. Shia has the
chops, but gets surrounded by weak emotional performances, both from
CGI and real people. In this outing, Megan Fox&#x27;s eye candy character
was replaced by Victoria Secret&#x27;s model (and current Jason Statham
girlfriend), Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Whiteley was an improvement in
sense of acting ability, but the part was written levels below what Fox
was given. The original love interest had layers, depth and some edge,
while Whiteley was given virtually no background, no emotional outlet
and nothing to do but stand there and be hot. Sure, the 12-year old in
the audience doesn&#x27;t want or need more, but to them I say, &#x22;Go grab a
Victoria Secret&#x27;s catalog from your parent&#x27;s bathroom and stay out of
my movie.&#x22;<br /><br />Beyond the magical pair of leads, Bay brings back the regular tough
guys, Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson, to keep on keeping on. They both
do fine jobs and don&#x27;t try to make this more than it is. Coming in for
the first time in the franchise is Frances McDormand, an Academy Award
winner to class up the joint. While she was amusing and brought a
little more skill to the screen, her part was borderline over-the-top,
even in a movie with three story tall robots, because she had to
balance out John Tuturro who drifts somewhere off to Hunter S. Thompson
land. As if they weren&#x27;t enough, Bay decides to bring in an unusual
amount of big name cameos, including John Malkovich (who does a decent
job in his few scenes) and Ken Jeong (who seems to be acting in a
completely different movie, possibly thinks he&#x27;s filming Hangover 3). I
saved the best for last though, my personal favorite and the only
person I was actually thrilled to see appear on screen, Alan Tudyk (who
plays Tuturo&#x27;s assistant/bodyguard). Tudyk is a cult TV and film legend
to his legions of fans spanning from the days of Firefly, Dollhouse and
other projects not created by Joss Wheedon. Tudyk was the one person I
actually cheered form when he magically appeared on screen.<br /><br />I could go into a section now where I talk about the story, the plot
lines, the connective tissue of the writing, but in reality, Bay didn&#x27;t
really care and neither do the younger members of the crowd, so let&#x27;s
just skip it.<br /><br />The End of the Page recommendation: Transformers: Dark of the Moon
starts slow, goes out with a bang and delivers surface entertainment
for the middle school crowd.
