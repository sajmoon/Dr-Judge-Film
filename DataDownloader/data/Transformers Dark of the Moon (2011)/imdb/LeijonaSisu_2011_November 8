2011_November 8 
The entire movie was a unexplainable and pathetic from start to finish.
It was nothing but a squashed together mess of the most immature,
boring and disgusting pre-schooler humour. Honestly, I am so sick and
tired of Sam&#x27;s annoying mother and her benign sex prep-talks. I got
bored of that within the first 3 minutes of the first Transformers
movie. It&#x27;s not funny and it never ever, ever will be.<br /><br />This movie is nothing but a &#x27;f&#x27; you message to everyone that Michael
Bay holds remorse to. While watching this movie it really is so
painfully obvious that the director M.B. was so angry at Megan Fox he
just decided to completely destroy her image within the movie. I find
it hilarious that in an interview he said he wasn&#x27;t &#x27;hurt&#x27; by the
Hitler comment. Obviously he just thought that he&#x27;d get his own back
like a sore loser teenager by bad mouthing her in this movie.<br /><br />While watching I could not believe how many things Michael Bay had
ripped off from other movies, games and everything in general.<br /><br />This movie stole the armoured cars and mounted machine guns from Death
race. Why have those now? I didn&#x27;t see them in any other transformers
movie. They always partially or completely transformed to fire upon
enemies. Now they just drive around with mounted guns like Death Race
wtf? Michael Bay also stole the &#x27;Spike Grenade&#x27; idea from Bungie&#x27;s best
selling Xbox game &#x27;Halo&#x27;. The entire design as well as the explosion
and effect of the grenade was completely 100% stolen and entirely
reproduced into the movie. I found this sickeningly unbelievable. That
Michael thinks he can get away with obvious plagiarism.<br /><br />The script made me want to start a fight with all of the actors. Were
the writers drunk when they thought this up? The whole movie and I
swear on my life, just felt like they just made it up as they went! I
couldn&#x27;t stand how cocksure all the actors sounded, especially that of
Agent Seymour Simmons. I am so sick to death of this man&#x27;s attitude.
Every stupid retort that came from his mouth made my blood boil. I also
can&#x27;t believe they picked Brian O&#x27;Connors partner to cameo at the end
of this movie. What a joke...<br /><br />Just when I thought that this putrid mess of a movie couldn&#x27;t get any
worse there had to be a &#x27;humorous gay scene&#x27; man on man in the toilet.
Only someone as hopelessly dim-witted as an American could possibly
find this anything but disgusting.<br /><br />Just about 99% of the dialogue was completely unnecessary as well as
... you know what.. my moral compass is just so f&#x27;ed up after watching
this I am having trouble reviewing it.<br /><br />This movie was just a collaboration of explosions after explosions
after.... you get the point. Sometimes I think that Michael Bay just
likes to blow stuff up. Which is so obvious from &#x27;Pearl Harbour&#x27; which
is nothing but explosions, explosions and oh sorry- here I go again. A
$250,000,000 budget and this is all you could come up with? Take the
ending to transformers 1 &#x26; 2 and just add even more outrageously
pathetic high-school romance, unnecessary scenes that contribute
nothing to the movie, extra sex prep-talks from the mum as well as a
girlfriend who has the exact same issues as the last one. Let&#x27;s not
forget the annoying government official who opposes the entire
operation altogether just like the last 2 previous guys did. Where
would we be without the iconic figure that represents humanity that
despises the autobots altogether.<br /><br />The movie franchise has absolutely nowhere to go. You have to have
these basic grounding points to even get a movie like this running,
without them you have nothing. The franchise already showed it&#x27;s limits
with the first movie. I hope to god there will not be a fourth.<br /><br />I will never, as long as I live, watch another movie directed by
Michael Bay. Because all you are ever watching when you see his movies
is his ego shining through more brightly than the force of a thousand
suns. Michael Bay is obviously on drugs. I can&#x27;t believe he thinks that
he could get away with this. I frankly would never want to show my face
in public ever again if I starred in this movie. No one can replace
Megan Fox, at least the girl had some decency. This little Victoria
Secret pin-up had absolutely no self-respect for herself. Or maybe it
was just Michael Bay and his &#x27;inner desires&#x27; shining through once
again.<br /><br />All in all this movie wasn&#x27;t a movie. It was the most painful and
disappointing thing I have ever seen in my life. If I had one wish now,
it would be that I could remove this movie from existence entirely.<br /><br />What a disaster, what a waste of time. I can&#x27;t believe I am even
writing this review out but I have to vent some frustration. Read the
review on the first page.<br /><br />There was also so much advertising in this movie. Nokia advertising,
Michelin Tyres advertising and even Gilette advertising on the side of
the &#x27;Death Race&#x27; stolen cars. The whole movie just tore bits and pieces
out of everything that I have enjoyed in my life and made it horrible
and made me feel horrible about myself for liking them in the first
place.<br /><br />I hate what the director has done to this movie, it&#x27;s actors and the
franchise. I will never tell anyone that I ever liked transformers in
the first place, lest I be beaten by the people I hold dear.<br /><br />If there is anything good I can do in this world, anything at all, it&#x27;s
warn others not to watch this movie.<br /><br />Michael Bay wanted to conqueror the world with this movie but he did
nothing except successfully polish a turd.
