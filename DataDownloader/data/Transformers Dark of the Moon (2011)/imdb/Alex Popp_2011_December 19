I watched this movie in 3D on my birthday with a few of my friends, and
we all loved it. In fact, the second the words &#x22;Directed by Michael
Bay&#x22; suddenly appeared on the screen, one of them immediately shouted
out &#x22;It was so good!&#x22; like 30 times.<br /><br />With one of the best movie openings, out-of-the-ordinary robot fight
scenes, and the most stunning 3D effects EVER, &#x22;Transformers 3&#x22; is
stupendous on many levels. It&#x27;s an extremely electrifying, visually
astounding, utterly satisfying pulse pounder that no way deserves any
critical denunciation that it may have received.<br /><br />If you&#x27;re a fan of the first movie who was sorely disappointed by
&#x22;Revenge of the Fallen&#x22;, as I was, don&#x27;t let that make you hesitate to
see this huge improvement to the series. In fact, I have good reason to
think that Michael Bay understood and listened to everyone&#x27;s complaints
on the second movie. I believe that this was his way of saying, &#x22;I&#x27;m
sorry. I&#x27;ll make it up to you.&#x22;<br /><br />&#x22;Dark of the Moon&#x22; has the coolest and most interesting premise of the
three. It has to do with the last days of Cybertron, during which a
single spacecraft known as the Ark crash-landed on the moon. The crash
was the reason for our nation&#x27;s space race. When Buzz Aldrin and Neil
Armstrong discovered it when they landed on the moon (we see this in
one of the most intriguing first scenes in a movie), its secret was
kept hidden for 42 years. When the Autobots learn of it, they are on a
race against the Decepticons to reach the ship and discover its
secrets, ultimately leading to the robots&#x27; final battle.<br /><br />There are even parts of the movie that are laugh-out-loud funny,
particularly the scenes with John Malkovich.<br /><br />I was quite glad that Megan Fox wasn&#x27;t in it. She was replaced with
Rosie Huntington-Whitely, who is a better actress, and her character
isn&#x27;t pointless. It&#x27;s because of her that this movie seems to have a
better love story than the others. And fortunately, she&#x27;s not as much
of a (I probably shouldn&#x27;t say this) slut as Mikaela.<br /><br />Another thing I was glad about was that humans seem to play as much a
part in the movie as the robots, unlike the first two. And Shia LaBeouf
is in full mind meld with his character.<br /><br />But enough about the other stuff and to the contents that REALLY make
the movie.<br /><br />It was the greatest 3D movie that I&#x27;ve ever experienced. Yes, even more
than &#x22;Avatar.&#x22; <br /><br />Complete with even more spectacular visual effects that its
predecessors, none of the action ever fails to deliver. The final
battle scene goes on for a full 48 minutes! And just when you think
that it&#x27;s never going to end, it ends the way it was supposed to with
another great song by Linkin Park.<br /><br />This movie ROCKS!!! Best action movie ever, all the way, no questions
asked. Although it isn&#x27;t the best movie I&#x27;ve ever seen, it&#x27;s definitely
the most thrilling.<br /><br />10/10 for the beyond epic,&#x22;Transformers: Dark of the Moon&#x22;, better than
the first two movies combined. And for the record, that&#x27;s the last time
I read a Roger Ebert review.
