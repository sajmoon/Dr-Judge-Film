2011_July 7 
Having enjoyed the first film a lot (a good blend of action and
comedy), I was greatly disappointed by the second film (too much bad
comedy and barely any memorable action scenes) and was concerned how
the third would turn out. It seems that Bay reduced some of painfully
unfunny comical moments from the last and improves on the action
however there are still some moments that take us back to ROTF
reminding me that Bay still hasn&#x27;t learned entirely from his previous
mistakes.<br /><br />There&#x27;s no writer&#x27;s strike to hind behind this time and Spielberg is
back on the team so what stops this from being as good as the first
one? The best answer that I can give is that the film feels too chaotic
and messy in its storytelling for it to become truly enjoyable. There
are some key plot points that are delivered either by crazy robots who
are hard to understand or by human characters talking really fast while
the camera is focusing on their skin molecules. If you are going to
tell a story in a film aimed towards a young audience, speak clearly or
as in this case, it turns into someone making a mess of a job interview
by speaking too fast in an effort to cover up any holes in their
presentation hoping that those listening will not notice. I know that
the story isn&#x27;t really worth worrying about but we deserve to have an
understanding of what is going on.<br /><br />Other issues include unnecessarily comedic moments such as Ken Jeong
who should have been taken out of the script (but his scenes are
pointless so maybe there was no script for him) as that could have
allowed for more time to be spent trying to develop the Autobots.
Thankfully that character has an abrupt ending that couldn&#x27;t have come
sooner. However the film does achieve at some points in being funny.
Perhaps if the film had concentrated on being like the trailer i.e.
being darker and focusing on the events at-hand it would have been so
much better.<br /><br />Thankfully the film never becomes too offensive unlike the last, making
for an enjoyable final act as Chicago is destroyed. Amongst all the
chaotic destruction that we have all seen before is an action set-piece
set within a collapsing building that we keep you fixed to the screen.
It has everything that Bay forgot to do with the rest of the film,
which is that there is tension, there is a purpose to the scene, the
build-up is great and you are actually concerned for how the characters
will escape. If only there were more scenes like this one, which you
actually care for!<br /><br />Returning cast members (Shia, Sam&#x27;s parents who are actually pretty
good this time, Josh Duhamel and John Turturro) are all watchable.
Meagan Fox&#x27;s replacement may divide opinion but I found Rosie
Huntington-Whiteley to fit in well amongst the rest of the film. John
Malkovich is funny at first but his character soon feels more like a
cameo. Ken Jeong was horrible to watch and nearly derailed the film.
Patrick Dempsey was good at would he did but come the battle he had
little to do. Frances McDormand played the cold government agent role
well while Alan Tudyk was good but deserved a bigger role. <br /><br />But of-course the film is about the Transformers and the auto-bots in
this are all pretty good. Like last time there could have been more of
Ratchet and Ironhide but they have their moments. Bumblebee is as good
as he was in the first film but I felt the focus had been moved too far
away from him and Sam&#x27;s relationship together which was important in
the first film. Optimus still demands the audiences attention
every-time you that red and blue truck enter the screen but there is
one scene where I found myself questioning his actions but on the whole
he was great and Peter Cullen is fantastic as ever.<br /><br />There is something wrong with the villains though this time as they
never really seem to be much of a threat as they seem to get taken down
pretty quickly. More of an emphasis on the villains strengths and
capabilities would have drastically improved the already enjoyable
action scene at the end. Sorry guys but the once great Starscream from
the first film is gone and we are still left with a sniveling henchman
that is embarrassing to watch at times considering he was the one who
tore those jets to pieces at the end of the first. <br /><br />Overall this is enjoyable to watch. When it works (collapsing building
and car chase scenes) it really works and this also goes for the
humour. Sadly the film is not perfect but I doubt anyone was expecting
it to be. Once again the trailer promises something else but what we
end up receiving is still worth your attention if you enjoyed the
either of the last two.
