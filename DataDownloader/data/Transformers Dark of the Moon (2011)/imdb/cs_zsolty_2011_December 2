- story is simple, predictable and simply stupid - Megatron is here
again (oh yes he just wont die even after two times getting killed) -
buildings getting ripped apart but hey guess what people are still
sitting by their desks just waiting for a robot to go and kill them -
Sam&#x27;s girlfriend is simply not an actor (zero talent) - did I say that
the story is really bad? - borrowed scenes from previous episodes - the
main characters just don&#x27;t die even if the whole building melts in to
molecules they still come out without a scratch - AND THE BIGGEST of
all - Megatron falls for a psychology trick?!!!!!! UNBELIEVABLE!! How
can you sink so low Bay?<br /><br />oh yes... Megatron is dead again lets bet on it that somehow he will be
back again.... pathetic..
