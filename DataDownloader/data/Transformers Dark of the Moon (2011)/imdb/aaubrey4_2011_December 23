Transformers: Dark of the Moon was such a terrible movie! It had poor
acting, casting, and sequences. Whaah! The movie involves, now
unemployed, Sam as he uncovers a Decepticon plan that could end the
world. He tries to confront the government along with the Autobots, but
no one listens for some reason. Then things get out of control.<br /><br />Where to start? Casting! As stated by others, our hapless semi-hero,
Sam is dating a collagen infused model who works for a billionaire who
gives her a multi-hundred-thousand-dollar car?! The Decepticons somehow
keep getting these ridiculously powerful additions, while the Autobots
get weak comic relief. Shia is still Shia--who is annoying and
frustrating. All of the old characters return and Bumblebee is still
the fave--funny because he doesn&#x27;t talk.<br /><br />The story could have been interesting, if they would have focused on it
instead of slow motion explosions and long, boring scenes that include
being slung through a building by a robotic snake for what seemed like
an eternity. Worst of all was the repeated placement of Sam&#x27;s parents
throughout the movie. I mean, in the midst of the looming danger, Sam
talks to his parents about relationship issues! I fast forwarded
through it and lost nothing.<br /><br />Other dumb things: Sam does parkour through Chicago. The decisions of
the US officials were idiotic and only served to drag out the film. I
was dumb for watching it (even though it was free).<br /><br />This movie was trash and Michael Bay continues with his efforts of
essentially making movies that have the feel of a 2-hour beer
commercial.
