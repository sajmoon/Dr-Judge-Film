Despite the negative reviews by critics, this film is packed with
classic Michael Bay and Transformers action. From start to finish a
great movie, it has great chemistry between the characters and the
robots, with an awesome storyline that really makes you think. There
are several minor blips and mistakes I noticed, but they do not take
away from movie at all. I would say it is slightly better than the
first film and a lot better than the second one. Like Michael Bay said
the film could go bigger than the second so bringing it back into a
small arena was an added bonus. the 3D was also a nice addition to the
movie added to the immersing experience. Nonetheless I am a fan of the
trilogy and plan on seeing it again. I recommend anyone who is a fan of
explosions, non stop action, and comedy to see this film, maybe even
twice!!!
