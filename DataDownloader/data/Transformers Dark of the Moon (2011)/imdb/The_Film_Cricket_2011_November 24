Having endured the mind-numbing dumb-headedness of Transformers:
Revenge of the Fallen, I arrive at this second sequel with a sense of
overriding weariness. We know the pattern by now because it doesn&#x27;t
seem willing to change: The good-natured Autobots have a tiff with the
hate-fueled Decepticons and they have brought their war to our planet
so we can watch one of our most beautiful metropolises (In this case,
Chicago) demolished for well over an hour. What did Chicago do to
deserve this? Transformers: Dark of the Moon has more story than the
previous films, but it is still another loud, dumb, crude, overlong
monstrosity. The story is convoluted and involves a plot that begins in
the early 1960s, surmising that President Kennedy&#x27;s determination to
put a man on the moon was fueled by an alien spacecraft called The Ark
that landed there (Kennedy occupies the film via a bad special effect
that is ineffective and rather creepy). Between the giant robots that
inspired the moon landing and the mutants that got involved in The
Cuban Missle Crisis in this summer&#x27;s X-Men: First Class, it is wonder
that JFK didn&#x27;t resign.<br /><br />Here in the good old 21st century, the war between the two robot
factions has come to earth and the only real question to be raised is
which faction will occupy the planet once our cities are reduced to
rubble in the mechanical struggle. I didn&#x27;t really care why the robots
came to earth or what they did when they got here. After the movie
explains their intentions, I somehow felt that I was better off not
knowing. I thought back to the simplistic purpose of this summer&#x27;s
superb Super 8, in which the visiting alien&#x27;s central focus was a
willingness to tear this planet apart just to get off of it, The
Transformers plot over-extends itself.<br /><br />On the human scale, the Autobot&#x27;s top ally is Sam Witwicky (Shia
LeBeouf) who has graduated from college, taken up with a gorgeous new
girlfriend named Carley (Victoria&#x27;s Secret model Rosie
Huntington-Whitely) and is frustrated because he can&#x27;t find a decent
job. On top of that, a billionaire car collector who is Carley&#x27;s former
boyfriend. Sam is frustrated a lot in this movie. He screams a lot,
throws fits a good chunk of the time and seems so animated that we
wonder if he isn&#x27;t on something. It is possible that Mr. LeBeouf may
have figured out what I have about his role: If we stand back and look
at this plot from a distance, Sam really has no purpose in this movie.<br /><br />Humans are beside the point. My overriding problem with Transformers:
Dark of the Moon rests with the robots. The Autobots and the
Decepticons are incomprehensible when you look at them. I can&#x27;t tell
one from the other. They seem built from a morass of metal that forms
something 40-feet tall with arms and legs and something that might be
mistaken for a face. This time around some have hair for reasons I
can&#x27;t begin to explain. Those faces aren&#x27;t expressive, but hidden
within all the metal. They have mouths but why do they need them? When
they fight and their bodies are pressed against one another, you can&#x27;t
tell one from the other. They&#x27;re metal, therefore they can&#x27;t get hurt,
so why do we care? If they get destroyed, they can be rebuilt. Right?
Plus, they make no logical sense. How does a 50 foot-tall robot have
enough metal in his body to transform into a full-sized pick-up truck?
They are on this planet to fight one another, but what are they
fighting about? What makes a robot good or evil? Who decided which side
they would be on? What makes them intelligent? What makes them able to
think and talk? What do they do when they aren&#x27;t fighting? Who sent
them here? Who built them? Why were they built? Why do they transform
into a automobiles? The robots are all male, so are their females? Was
this trip really necessary?
