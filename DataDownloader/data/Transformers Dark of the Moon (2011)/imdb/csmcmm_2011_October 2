Lots of people will give this movie a bad rating, and many of them may
be justified. However, just how many of those will have been following
the series from the beginning?<br /><br />This is a good continuation of the story, however. Loaded with a bunch
of eye-candy and all sorts of action sequences, this movie continues to
thrill those who like to watch action and sci-fi.<br /><br />There are some serious flaws in the scenery, though. For example, when
we&#x27;re expected to believe that serious stuff is happening in Chicago,
it&#x27;s actually Detroit&#x27;s former Packard auto assembly plant that is the
backdrop for some scenes. Granted, many may not know of the difference,
but for those of us that do know about it, it&#x27;s a serious flaw. After
all, Detroit is NOT Chicago, and vise-versa.<br /><br />But however you look at it, this movie continues to entertain those of
us who enjoy the sci-fi and action genres, and it does it quite well.
Here&#x27;s looking towards another installment or two of the series.
