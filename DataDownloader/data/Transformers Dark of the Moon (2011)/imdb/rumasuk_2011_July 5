i feel bad for giving this movie a 6, it deserves a 6.5 in my rating
system. Its better told than the 2nd one, but aside from the effects
and action sequences, well it sucks.<br /><br />I&#x27;m surprised that people like this better than transformers 2. my
guess is that they hated the 2nd one so much that this could seem only
better. Because this movie is not better than the second one, its just
told in a better way (slightly).<br /><br />Im sorry if you re a united states citizen, but every movie that goes
for the proud us flag waving in the back style of script fails, and
fails in a big way. Bay movies are no masterpiece in my opinion, they
are written for people who are very different than me and my kind of
people.<br /><br />don&#x27;t get me wrong i enjoyed the movie, but i knew what it was. The
action scenes are awesome, like really awesome, specially the falling
building scene and the final battle: the new bad guy fought off all the
autobots like a MACHO, and he gets killed in the most pussy way. the
dialog SUCKS, in the name of freedom we declare you the war?? damn that
was bad. At least there is no mudflap and his brother who were awful in
the second film.<br /><br />for me there were like 6 big plot holes and did i mention the dialog
sucked? but the acting was not bad for me. another thing that bugged
me, Malkovich, Mcdormand and Turturro are all major Coen brothers
stars, are they friends with Bay or what?.<br /><br />i didn&#x27;t hate the movie, the action was awesome and only that gave it
the six points i gave it. i would like to give it more because i gave
the previous movie a 7, but i will change the score of the previous
film to 6 as well, because thats is the score the trilogy deserves.<br /><br />Bay should go on a mystical trip to other cultures and return to
filmaking after at least 5 years, he should change his views because he
is being toss aside of whats really cool nowadays
