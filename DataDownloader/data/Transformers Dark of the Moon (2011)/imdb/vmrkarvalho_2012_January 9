&#x22;Dark Of The Moon&#x22; is the first Transformers movie that I actually
liked a lot. The others are good fun and all, but they&#x27;re never what
&#x22;they could have been&#x22;. And, to be honest, Michael Bay is a great
visual director, but a TERRIBLE storyteller. It shows a lot in almost
everything he touches (&#x22;Pearl Harbor&#x22; being the best example of how the
man, simply, can&#x27;t tell a story).<br /><br />Having said that, I feel that Bay directed this movie with the single
intent to show us one of the greatest fire-work movies of all time.
Screw the story, the characters and the substance and let&#x27;s simply blow
something up. The &#x22;final fight&#x22; last for about an hour and I just
didn&#x27;t want it to end. <br /><br />Let&#x27;s face it, nobody walks in a Transformers movie for the story,
that&#x27;s just stupid. If you want to see some of the greatest action
scenes ever made, watch this film. If you&#x27;re looking for a great story
and a beautiful romance, go see Titanic or something else. This is a
film for the eyes. And it delivers it in an amazing fashion.
