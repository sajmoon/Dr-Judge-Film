Steven Spielberg how could you? This is the third of a terrible trilogy
of tumbling crashing metal. Hopefully it&#x27;s the last. People how could
you make this a billion dollar movie? It&#x27;s just too brain dead. The
only good thing : the battle in Chicago and the destruction in the city
involves some amazing filming. But the robots all look alike and it&#x27;s
too long and confusing. A little less confusing than in the past.
Michael Bay has always been about visuals and not story and dialog.
This is no exception. Bad the worst thing is the casting. Rose
Huntington Whitley just isn&#x27;t beautiful. She is tall and slim but her
face is way below average - actually quite frightful and her acting
isn&#x27;t good. Her diction is poor for a British actress too. Huge mistake
replacing Megan Fox who was the only good thing about the last 2
movies. Patrick Dempsey isn&#x27;t right as a villain he comes across as he
always does - a weak good guy. Frances McDormand is usually such a good
actress but even she can&#x27;t do anything with the silly lines she is
given. What a waste of time.
