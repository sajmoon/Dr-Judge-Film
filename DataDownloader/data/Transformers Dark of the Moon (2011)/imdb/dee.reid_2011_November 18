2011_November 18 
I have to say that I actually really enjoyed 2011&#x27;s &#x22;Transformers: Dark
of the Moon,&#x22; much like I did its predecessors &#x22;Transformers&#x22; (2007)
and &#x22;Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen&#x22; (2009). Now I know I&#x27;ll
probably just catch hell for making that statement. But I don&#x27;t care,
it&#x27;s my thoughts and that&#x27;s all that matters to me.<br /><br />Like most 20-somethings today, I grew up watching the original
&#x22;Transformers&#x22; cartoons throughout my youth growing up in the early
&#x27;90s. Those were really good times. I even collected a few of the
Hasbro toys (which inspired the cartoon and big-budget live-action
movies), but my admiration for &#x22;Transformers&#x22; never really peaked
because the channel that I used to watch the original series on removed
the show from its early-morning line-up during the mid-90s and it
didn&#x27;t return to TV until just recently - like within the last four
years when the first live-action movie was released.<br /><br />History lesson over...<br /><br />Like its two predecessors, &#x22;Transformers: Dark of the Moon&#x22; is loud,
obnoxious, high destructive good fun. The first film is obviously the
best by any standard, I&#x27;m partial to liking the second film only
slightly more than that one, and this third entry probably has the most
ridiculously over-the-top city-wide siege battle I&#x27;ve ever seen. (The
film&#x27;s last 40 minutes are basically one long action sequence; 20 years
ago something of this magnitude would have been impossible because of
the sheer scale of everything but because of CGI and bigger budgets,
lengthy action sequences of this type are now commonplace in the movies
today.)<br /><br />As you will recall (or in case you&#x27;ve been living under a rock and have
no idea what a &#x22;Transformer&#x22; is), the whole &#x22;Transformers&#x22; mythology
involves a centuries-old war between the heroic Autobots and the
malevolent Decepticons, massive shape-changing robots of
extraterrestrial origin who mistakenly bring their conflict from their
home planet Cybertron to Earth where humans are soon brought into the
fold along with them.<br /><br />&#x22;Transformers: Dark of the Moon&#x22; begins in 1961, when an Autobot
spaceship carrying a secret from Transformer home planet Cybertron
crash-lands on the moon. A little bit of revisionist history thus takes
place in which it is revealed that the whole Space Race between the
United States and the Soviet Union at that time was instigated to see
who could reach the lunar crash site first and learn its secrets. (This
is all set up in some pretty quick-step tempo that includes archival
footage of President Richard Nixon and the 1969 moon landing integrated
with scenes newly shot by over-indulgent, over-director Michael Bay.)<br /><br />We learn that this secret could also save mankind, or wipe us out.<br /><br />The Decepticons are back once again, led by their fearsome leader
Megatron (voice of Hugo Weaving), and they once again resume their war
with the heroic Autobots who are led by Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter
Cullen, the only voice actor from the original &#x22;Transformers&#x22; TV
series). Caught in the middle of it, are determined human players Sam
Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf, still continuing his likable Everyman thing),
his new love interest Carly Spencer (newcomer and model Rosie
Huntington-Whitely, now having thoroughly replaced Megan Fox), soldiers
Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Epps (Tyrese Gibson), Agent Simmons (John
Turturro) and his assistant Dutch (Alan Tudyk), and newcomers federal
bureaucrat Agent Mearish (Frances McDormand) and Carly Spencer&#x27;s hunky
boss Dylan (Patrick Dempsey).<br /><br />Everything culminates in an epic, highly destructive Earth-bound siege
in Chicago between the Autobots and their human allies, and the evil
Decepticons.<br /><br />I think Bay out-did himself on this picture with seeing how many things
he can blow up and how many bullets can be fired. It&#x27;s all utterly
ridiculous, but the entire time I was more in awe of the amazing
technical feats of it all. From the beginning of the &#x22;Transformers&#x22;
series of films, I&#x27;ve always been impressed by the level of attention
paid to the littlest details of every scene.<br /><br />Every time a Transformer transforms, I&#x27;ve always been amazed by the
sights and sounds of metal parts clanking, whirring, and reconfiguring
into some robotic alien mass or robot disguised as heavy-duty
machinery. I&#x27;m also awed by the amazing details of every explosion,
every slain robot that gets torn apart limb from limb in battle, and
just the overall attention to detail. It&#x27;s a pure visual spectacle
where you&#x27;re just in awe of everything that&#x27;s going on. If you hate
Michael Bay, at least like his special effects.<br /><br />Whatever your feelings regarding Bay are, don&#x27;t miss out on this one;
you&#x27;ll only regret seeing one of the most finely detailed action epics
of the year.<br /><br />10/10
