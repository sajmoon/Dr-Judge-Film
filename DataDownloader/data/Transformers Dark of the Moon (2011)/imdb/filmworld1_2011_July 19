This is also one of the best 3D movies to date. One major critique of
3D is that 3D glasses make the film darker, but here they do a very
smart thing, the film itself is brighter than your average movie and
this problem evens itself out. Another thing that worried me before I
saw it is that if there was so much high-speed action maybe that and
the combination of 3D would give me motion sickness, end of the movie:
no problems.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />The villains suck. Megatron does absolutely nothing throughout the
whole film until right at the end, and even that was a let down.
Shockwave appears briefly at the start and vanishes for two hours, he
himself doesn&#x27;t actually do much, it&#x27;s all down to this big nameless
tentacle- clad decepticon he works with. Starscream does nothing, but
then he never did anything anyway. I&#x27;m not even going to mention
Patrick Dempsey. But the biggest let down is with the movies main
villain &#x22;Sentinel Prime&#x22;. Basically he is Optimus&#x27; predecessor but he
changed sides to the decepticons and made a deal with Megatron to bring
life back to their home planet Cybertron. This is the driving element
of the movie, but there are many plot holes from this. Early in the
film Optimus basically says he wants to make Sentinel Prime leader of
the autobots again, and offers him the matrix (an item that brings dead
transformers back to life) but Sentinel Prime declines. Then he changes
sides. Why did he decline taking the matrix? it would in definitely be
a help in his ploy. Sentinel Prime gets numerous chances to kill
Optimus once and for all, but like all lousy villains he delays his
hand and Optimus lives.
