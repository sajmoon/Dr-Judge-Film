I have to say I enjoyed watching Transformers 3. If you take it for
what it is, a Michael Bay movie with awesome, epic visuals, an
over-the- top weak plot, not very deep characters, and classic &#x27;Bay&#x27;
humor, then it&#x27;s great. Not as good as the first, but easily better
than the 2nd one. <br /><br />First off, the visual effects are amazing. One of the best, if not the
best, that I&#x27;ve seen, both in details on the transformers, in
action/fighting sequences, and in more general landscape shots - the
views of Chicago when it was being attacked by decepticons were great.
I watched it in 3D in the theater, and it was arguably the best 3D
effects I&#x27;ve seen, and best use of 3D cameras, and that is including
Avatar which i also saw in 3D. This is what Michael Bay is really good
at, and this movie shows he is arguably the expert in visual effects
and composition.<br /><br />visual effects and presentation - 10/10<br /><br />The plot isn&#x27;t great. When it starts out, it seems like it might
develop nicely into a moderately complex story rooted in some
historical events that happened very differently than how we thought
(kind of like the hoover dam part in the first transformers), but in
the end not much is made of that and the plot is relatively direct and
over-the-top. However, it does have a few good moments that offer a bit
more complexity or emotion, and anyways I didn&#x27;t watch the movie hoping
for a subtle, complex, and nuanced plot.<br /><br />Plot - 6/10<br /><br />The characters and acting aren&#x27;t Oscar-worthy either, to say the least.
Rosie Huntington-Whitely is not a great actress, in fact she isn&#x27;t
really an actress, and it shows, but, to be honest, I have seen worse
performances. Shia Labeouf is decent in his role as usual. and again
there are some new characters, including some for Michael Bay- esque
comic relief (which in my opinion is actually funnier than much of the
humor in revenge of the fallen, which felt a little too forced to me).<br /><br />Characters/acting - 6/10<br /><br />Fun - 8/10<br /><br />If you&#x27;re expecting a layered, nuanced movie with deep characterization
and a complex and well-written plot, well, then, don&#x27;t watch this. If,
though, you want a fun blockbuster with truly amazing visual effects, a
decent (but forgettable) storyline and characterization, and an easy to
follow dynamic, well you&#x27;ll probably like Transformers 3.
