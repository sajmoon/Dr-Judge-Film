I&#x27;m a huge sucker for seeing a full movie. I almost walked out of hobo
with a shotgun (because my moral fibers disagreed with it) and I nearly
walked out of this one cause I lost complete track of the story and all
I could remember was a bunch of CGI robots destroying Chicago in 3-D.<br /><br />Michael bay, next time you make a movie, please slow down enough to
tell us what&#x27;s going on. that&#x27;s what&#x27;s wrong with this one, along with
the stupid clich&#xE9;s and mistakes. And another thing, I never saw the
original transformers, but to hear the words &#x22;Transformers! More than
meets the Eye&#x22; somewhere in the film would&#x27;ve made me smile.<br /><br />On a positive note, The 3D Effects in this one are actually really
good. In most modern flicks they&#x27;re a joke, only showing little bits of
3D here and there, but in this one, objects were coming towards me a
lot so i have no complaints about spending the extra 3 bucks for
glasses. Also, as mentioned in the headnote, The special effects look
like they had a majority of the budget spent on them.<br /><br />If you&#x27;re looking to satisfy your craving for transformers, stick to
the TV show. it&#x27;s on Teletoon Retro at certain times.
