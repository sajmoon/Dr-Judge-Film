This movie... was awesome. i mean AWESOME!<br /><br />Sure there&#x27;s some dodgy stuff about it (Rosie Huntington Whitely&#x27;s
performance for one) but then what the heck did you expect from a movie
that&#x27;s essentially about gigantic fighting robots?<br /><br />i know that&#x27;s not an &#x22;excuse&#x22; sure... why should we lower our
expectations when it comes to big summer blockbusters? why should we
expect no real story or strong non-stereotypical characters? i&#x27;ll tell
you why... it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a big flipping action movie that&#x27;s
essentially about gigantic fighting robots. <br /><br />the whole premise of transformers (remember, based on toys) is
ridiculous. It&#x27;s preposterous. but it IS AWESOME. so, in fact, no, i
don&#x27;t want to be wasting my brain too much getting really &#x27;in&#x27; to how
deep and thoughtful the movie is. yawn-o-rama. <br /><br />Having said that, a story is present here, and it works perfectly well
for the source material. It tells of a device that has the power to
re-shape the universe.<br /><br />re-shape what i hear you cry? the universe? YES! THE UNIVERSE! that&#x27;s
epic man i don&#x27;t care what you say. it plays out mostly like an epic
fantasy, with it&#x27;s own mythology and world relatable history. and man,
what more do you want? <br /><br />Michael Bay is the king of blowing stuff up. He&#x27;s the man here who
dreamt &#x22;what would it be like it bunches of massive metallic
transforming alien robots started having a war on our planet, smashing
each other and everything around them to smithereens&#x22; And I&#x27;m so glad
he did dream that dream. because this movie perfectly portrays exactly
what i&#x27;d imagine would happen if this was in fact the case.<br /><br />We need this guy. Nobody creates this kind of spectacle like he does.
it&#x27;s so impressive. I can&#x27;t even imagine beginning to conceive some of
the sequences he pulls off in this movie. and he does it with such
ease. It&#x27;s so easy to hate michael bay, sure it is. he makes big dumb
action movies, but we know this, and i really really enjoy a big dumb
action movie once in a while. it&#x27;s so much fun.<br /><br />michael bay is the man. yes, THE MAN. he is your man for pure explosive
spectacle. No one else would have done a better job of this movie. I
genuinely believe that.<br /><br />Beautifully mixing perfectly realised CG effects with epic locations.
The camera always at some kind of ridiculous angle that makes
everything look GINORMOUS. Huge towering sky scrapers, and vast
landscapes setting the backdrop for the showdown. <br /><br />It&#x27;s a movie that knows exactly what it is, and who it&#x27;s aimed at
(that&#x27;s right, horny teenage boys) and because of that, this movie
DELIVERS. I&#x27;m now in my twenties, but when I was a young teenager, all
i wanted to see was some awesome action, some crazy effects and some
hot women. boom boom boom. this movie nails it.<br /><br />Given most of the reviews from critics and again here on IMDb, people
seem to have forgotten what fun it is to go and watch a real event
movie. To see something that will blow you away. To have an experience.
(3D came about for this reason) You want your ears bleeding, you want
your eyeballs popping out, you wanna be guzzling your popcorn at all
the visual thrills. <br /><br />well i do at least. <br /><br />i love movies. i love everything about movies. and i loved this movie.
for all it&#x27;s obvious flaws, it&#x27;s not trying to be anything but what it
is. and i love it for that. <br /><br />sorry if i rambled on there. i know it&#x27;s not the most eloquently
written review. i think you get the idea of how i felt about this
movie.<br /><br />go see it with your brain tuned the right way and you&#x27;ll have a blast.
