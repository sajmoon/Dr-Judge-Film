First off, I&#x27;d like to warn every person reading the following review,
if you&#x27;re the kind of person who wants to be showered with
Existentialism, whose every goal in life is to get a deep
interpretation or philosophical meaning of life out a movie, get the
f...(fun?) out of here. If you want every film you watch, to have
in-depth development of realistic characters dealing with emotional
themes, or to have the intro, mid and final sequence to be in
accordance with your idea of &#x27;film-making&#x27; and not the director&#x27;s, or
to judge the director&#x27;s work based on prejudices from previous works,
or to have an impeccable storytelling, script, narrative, plot,
dialogue, timings, chemistry between the lead roles, cinematography,
and the likes, you&#x27;re better of staying the f...(far) out of here. Go
watch something else, there&#x27;s close to 2 million titles in this
website&#x27;s database so you (and your pet, or whoever you live with) can
have a wonderful life researching titles that match your theoretical
frameworks to study social phenomena in a particular school of thought
or to match your deep philosophical needs, so that then you can climax
away. This isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;re looking for, specially if you are
explosion, adrenaline and testosterone intolerant.<br /><br />To the rest of us, the mundane, the ordinary people, who enjoy a
no-brainer, a popcorn flick, and who are not in their crisis-something
years, who enjoy a summer flick for what it is, and not for what we&#x27;d
want it to be (maybe as a substitute for our imperfect lives), I&#x27;d like
to say if you want to watch a good movie with great visuals and intense
action sequences, then this film will do you just fine. For the men out
there (and perhaps some ladies?), there is also some eye-candy. Let me
put it this way, it is called eye-candy for a reason; do we really care
if she lacks charisma?, or do we care if there&#x27;s no chemistry between
her and the lead man?, or do we care if &#x22;she&#x27;s be better off in
underwear commercials&#x22;? I certainly don&#x27;t care. I you, for some reason
do care about that, then you&#x27;re one of the aforementioned individuals
and my advice is to get the f...(friendly) out of here. <br /><br />This movie is worth your money and time, and furthermore I&#x27;d go ahead
and tell you that afterward you won&#x27;t feel disappointed that we didn&#x27;t
achieve world piece or we didn&#x27;t discover the origin of the universe.
Just go in with an open mind, and it will not be a let down.
