Mickael Bay is coming back with his new season of the &#x22;Transformers&#x22;
road show.<br /><br />Let me start with an anecdote : do you know how Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles were created in the 80&#x27;s ? The target audience were kids, so
the marketers came with a list of what kids used to adore : comics,
reptiles, kung-fu films and pizza! For the exact same reason, Mickael
Bay and Paramount marketing dept are coming back with robots, race
cars, heavy weaponry ... and centerfold girls! And that is why Sam
(Shia LaBeouf) is an adulescent, a teenager who depends on his
girlfriend and his parents for a living. Anyway...<br /><br />The introduction of the film (linking the Apollo program with fictional
events) is appealing, but the rest of the script makes absolutely no
sense. The motivations of Sentinel Prime are absurd, and nothing is
really logical in this movie.<br /><br />The cinematography is awful. The action scenes have no rhythm, and Bay
constantly relies on camera shaking and slow-motion. The SFX are awful,
robot 3D models are difficult to visualize.<br /><br />Acting is terrible. Of course, LaBeouf does not how to play, but I
would expect something better from Malkovitch and &#x27;Torturo&#x27;! This is
really a film you should avoid.
