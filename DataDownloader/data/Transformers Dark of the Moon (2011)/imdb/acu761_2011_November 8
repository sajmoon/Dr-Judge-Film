Wow! It is truly amazing what special effects can create and how far
technology has come... That is the only positive aspect of this movie.
It feels like the script was literally wrote by a second grader. The
acting was passable, however what each actor had to work with was utter
rubbish. The A D D generation is very much alive and kicking and now
have entire franchises focused toward them. I&#x27;m going to resist placing
the blame for this waste of 2+ hours on anyone person, because I know
$$ talks in this industry. It is time Hollywood stops trying to see
what they can do and start thinking about if they should... Clearly
they should have not in this case. Very poor movie.
