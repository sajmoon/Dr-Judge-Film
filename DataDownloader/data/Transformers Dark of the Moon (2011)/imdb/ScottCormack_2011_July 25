Yeah, I know for a fact that loads of fussy people will hate this
movie, but hey, I thought it was great! You must see this in 3D it
makes it better, best use in 3D used in cinema yet, giant robots flying
out at you - Beast. If you love action, explosion etc, then you have to
see it.<br /><br />I will admit the story wasn&#x27;t anything special, and did go on a little
too long but its action loaded non stop which was great! This film was
fantastic entertainment! You should go home liking this film and you
should love it in 3D. The film is no Shawshank Redemption, Saving
Private Ryan, Gladiator etc (my favourite films along with four lions
:P) but is just as entertaining. If you are one of those fussy film
watchers that critics everything then this is not for you.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a very entertaining film, flooded with action.
The story line wasn&#x27;t greatest but was still a good film! You must see
this is 3D, well worth the extra money unlike other films. I cannot
state how much more you will enjoy this in 3D!If not in 3D it may not
be so great. Im giving this a solid 8/10, thought i&#x27;d give this movie
some much deserved support and was entertained! Isn&#x27;t that what a films
about!
