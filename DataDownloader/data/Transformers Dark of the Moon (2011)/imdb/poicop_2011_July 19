First I should let you know I&#x27;m NOT A FAN OF TRANSFORMERS.<br /><br />I think the bad reviewers would all agree that they had fun, and at one
point or another going to or coming home from this movie only to write
another bad review, and be like the rest of the world that wants to
jump on the HATE Michael Bay, BAD Transformers waggon.<br /><br />Michael Bay Makes millions for the companies who produce he&#x27;s movies.
Transformers Make millions for the same.<br /><br />If they didn&#x27;t and these movies, or Bay did suck. They wouldn&#x27;t be
making them still.<br /><br />If you think the 3D or special effects in this movie are crap, or even
just alright. You should lose all credibility to reviewing movies. I
know 3D. I know special effects. And this is TOP NOTCH. That alone is
worth the price of the ticket.<br /><br />Shia Lebouf. is great. I said it when he was a kid. I said the same
thing about Cristian Bale when he was a kid. You can see the talent.<br /><br />Shia if your reading this. You keep doing what your doing. And I think
your timing is incredible. <br /><br />I had such a good time at this movie. I think the last time I had this
much fun watching a good old fashion, nothing too deep, action summer
blockbuster, was a long time ago.<br /><br />The last time I had this much ACTION fun was probably LIVE FREE DIE
HARD.<br /><br />Maybe a little long. Not too much. Story was I thought the best out of
the three. Funny. I really got into it. Maybe cause the critics bashed
it. And maybe cause I&#x27;m not a huge fan. Or I found the second one very
long, and needed a different pace to the edit.<br /><br />I picked up on some interesting little SPOCK Pop Culture a few times
through the movie also.<br /><br />I&#x27;m not into spoiling movies. But if you want some Summer fun. Eye
candy at it&#x27;s best! Transformers 3 is the ticket.<br /><br />If you were expecting Clock Work Orange, or No Country for Old Men. You
shouldn&#x27;t complain about what your walking into, or writing bashing
reviews with this film. If you think were going to have another STAR
WARS, JAWS, or CLOSE ENCOUNTERS type of Summer Fun movie come around
this lifetime. I don&#x27;t think that will happen. <br /><br />It&#x27;s about talking robots that turn into vehicles. A kids toy. An old
cartoon. They made a movie. And for that this third instalment in my
opinion. Was FUN! Lighten up!<br /><br />Cause frankly there&#x27;s a lot of disappointment when it comes to highly
anticipated summer blockbusters.<br /><br />Great Job to the cast and crew. Thanks for the memories of SUMMER fun
from days gone.<br /><br />What do you want.
