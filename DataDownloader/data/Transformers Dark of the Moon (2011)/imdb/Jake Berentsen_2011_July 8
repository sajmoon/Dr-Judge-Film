Transformers has never been a series about good story or good acting.
It&#x27;s about having too many explosions, stupid jokes, the hottest girls
I&#x27;ve ever seen bending over the nicest cars I&#x27;ve ever seen, and robots
killing each other.<br /><br />To think that it&#x27;s anything other a fun movie is expecting too much and
when the movie is 2 1/2 hours long you&#x27;ll have a bad time if you&#x27;re not
going to overlook the fact that it&#x27;s not the next Shawshank Redemption.
Michael Bay is a director who people go to expecting explosions and
action. In Transformers 3, you got it.<br /><br />However, the fact that it&#x27;s a very long movie does give it some
downsides. The real action doesn&#x27;t start until the second half of the
movie following a real exciting twist. One of my friends even started
crying at it. The second half though is without a doubt one of the
coolest movie scenes I&#x27;ve seen in a couple years. I went with my
girlfriend and we were talking about it with her dad and we suggested
going into it half way through the movie if he wouldn&#x27;t have the
patience for the slow beginning. I thought they were going to end the
movie at the twist at first and make it the sequel as the second half
would&#x27;ve been a great movie on it&#x27;s own.<br /><br />Similarly the story is all over the place, I would suggest not paying
too much attention to it as it wasn&#x27;t very good, only complex and
confusing. It&#x27;s slow and mysterious at first and until the action picks
up not a lot happens.<br /><br />Give the movie your attention long enough to get to the second half and
you&#x27;ll see some amazing robot fighting action that&#x27;s way cooler than
anything I could&#x27;ve done with those cool toys. It&#x27;s fun, it&#x27;s cool,
it&#x27;s stupid. Don&#x27;t let the fact that it isn&#x27;t a perfect movie ruin the
action. I would suggest seeing it in theater; it&#x27;s just a great time.
