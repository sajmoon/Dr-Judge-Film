The film was fantastic, but there are a few bones to pick with the
comic relief and sex jokes. But everything else was fantastic.<br /><br />The special effects were phenomenal, the acting was okay, the voice
acting second to none. The death sequences were fantastic and a genuine
surprise that they made Laserbeak a VERY disturbing character, and
Megatron and Optimus trying to kill each other at the end was
fantastic.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t understand why people are complaining about and a bunch of very
minor plot holes, when they let the 80&#x27;s movie plot holes pass up. A
well done film, nice action, nice VA, and Ebert&#x27;s review of it is just
further proof that he needs to retire. <br /><br />All in all 89/100
