Transformers: Dark of the Moon<br /><br />For humans, &#x22;dark of the moon&#x22; refers to the anus area of the person
mooning.<br /><br />For the transmogrifying space-creatures in this sci-fi movie, however,
it means the enslavement of humanity.<br /><br />When Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) learns that a ship from his home
world is marooned on the moon, he helms a mission to retrieve its sole
occupant, his mentor: Sentinel Prime (Leonard Nimoy).<br /><br />Unfortunately, Megatron (Hugo Weaving) and the Decepticons arrived at
the wreckage years earlier and claimed the cargo &#x96; pillars to connect a
spacebridge between Earth and Cybertron.<br /><br />Hoping to prevent its assembly is Optimus&#x27; human friend Sam (Shia
LaBeouf) and his new squeeze (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley).<br /><br />While it&#x27;s the best of the trilogy, Dark of the Moon is still a 3-hour
muddle of mechanical components clanging out a cacophonous din of
dumbness.<br /><br />Besides, there are more important things that could&#x27;ve been recovered
from the moon, like Buzz Aldrin&#x27;s wallet. (Red Light)
