I know that Michael Bay is the king of crap, and in that regard
slamming one of his movies for being a jumbled mess is probably
pointless. But still, despite myself I enjoyed the first two
Transformers-movies. The first more than the second, but the second was
alright all things considered. There has always been a mental cramp
when it comes to comic-relief and the scripts have always been
paper-thin. But something still appealed to me, I guess I could blame
my 1980&#x27;s childhood with a box full of Transformers-toys.<br /><br />First of all, I said before that the scripts were paper-thin for the
previous Transformers-movies. Considering that, this movie seems
written on a napkin and then added to and subtracted from in a system
of loose papers. Then someone dropped the pile of papers and all the
pages got mixed up and nothing was where it was supposed to be... But
Michael Bay seemed to say &#x22;screw it, we&#x27;ll just shoot the movie
anyway&#x22;. If I say that this movie makes no sense, I&#x27;m being as kind as
I could ever be. Most of the time it&#x27;s just a confused mess of events
piled on top of each other. There is no cohesion at all, there is no
plausible connection to the story from the first two movies. I
understand that the writers were probably struggling here to find a new
approach and create something out of nothing story-wise. But they chose
the wrong direction. Completely.<br /><br />Second point, this movie is almost one hour too long. There are so many
places where this movie could have been cut, trimmed and polished. It
would even have helped with the story because it&#x27;s such a mess now that
you could remove most of it without it really detracting from your
understanding.<br /><br />Third point, this movie wastes a few pretty good actors. And no, I
don&#x27;t mean Gray&#x27;s Anatomy, but rather John Malkovich and Frances
McDormand. I think that for them this was a fire-and-forget movie. Just
go in there, do the scenes, forget about it and smile when you see your
bank-draft. Because people are not the main thing here, the special
effects are. There is no room for characters, proper dialog or building
good drama. It seems like Bay sat in his directors chair and said &#x22;Oh,
these people have been talking for almost a minute, let&#x27;s have a robot
smash through the wall and break something before people fall asleep&#x22;.<br /><br />In the end this really is a complete waste of time. Special effects
are, just like in the previous movies, very well done indeed. Product
placements are very obvious and hugely embarrassing for all involved,
especially for the companies that payed to be shown in such a crap
movie. I guess if you are twelve years old and have ADD there might be
something here for you, but everyone else should just stay away. This
is a brainless blockbuster in every wrong way imaginable.
