2011_July 1 
I sometimes have the pleasure of babysitting my Grandkids, and my 4
year old grandson absolutely delights in throwing his toy cars and
trucks off of the second floor landing and seeing them burst apart. He
then collects and plays with the pieces, sometimes breaking them even
more. This movie is like that. It&#x27;s like the little boys who used to
play with the transformer cars when they were little got older and now
they&#x27;re still playing with them through the manipulations of cameras
and computers.<br /><br />This film does exhibit all of the usual modern computer generated
effects. The locations are widely separated with nothing being too
spectacular in that regard. The costuming is simple as are the props
(except the computer stuff of course). The sets are, well, hard to
judge because you can&#x27;t really believe they&#x27;re not primarily computer
generated effects. I think the problem is they keep trying to do bigger
and bigger special effects and at some point it almost gets boring from
being so uniformly explosive and overwhelmingly unreal. I&#x27;ll invent yet
another new term here to cover it: &#x22;Action Movie Desensitization&#x22;. One
can&#x27;t believe that these types of films are not solely aimed at the
average 12 year old out of school for the summer. There&#x27;s little else
in the theaters.<br /><br />The film also requires an immense degree of the ability to suspend
one&#x27;s disbelief to begin to watch it. The plot is as thin and makes
about as much logical sense as a 1930&#x27;s comic book plot, but it&#x27;s there
if you want to try to follow it. If you saw any of the preceding
&#x22;Transformer&#x22;-type films you could likely write a better plot yourself;
so just substitute your own plot in your head as the explosions unfold
(NOTE to writers; a college graduate usually isn&#x27;t a &#x22;teenager&#x22;).<br /><br />That leaves the acting. The principle characters do yeoman service for
their paychecks. Several previous denizens of Transformerville return
to reprise their former roles with Shia La Beouf straining his best to
out-panic and out-sweat his previous filmic efforts. He does so well,
along with John Turturro, Josh Duhamel, Patrick Dempsey and Alan Tudyk.
The always watchable Frances McDormand comes on strong as a
bad-womanesque government wienie. She was cool being bad. John
Malkovich provided a great characterization as La Beouf&#x27;s
mildly-insane, oddball boss. He and McDormand are likely the best
things in the film, BUT, there was a truly kinetic, unhinged, off-the
wall performance by the increasingly popular Ken Jeong. Watch for him,
he&#x27;s a riot.<br /><br />The odd addition is &#x22;the girl&#x22;- there&#x27;s always a girl. In this case the
very publicized Megan Fox from the former films was unceremoniously
replaced for little understood insults to the hands that fed her. Such
is life. But, Fox&#x27;s bad luck provided all the excuse necessary to
replace her with a younger model, literally. In this instance &#x22;the
girl&#x22; is &#x22;unconventionally beautiful&#x22; 24 year-old British farm
girl/model named Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Whitely&#x27;s previous claim to
fame, it seems, is the talent to look decent while walking around in
public places in her underwear, which, of course, brought her to the
attention of these film makers, so, at this point in her career I
imagine her strategy has worked out rather well. She&#x27;s not terrible in
the film so at least she doesn&#x27;t embarrass herself. However, skimpier
costuming may have brought in a few dozen more teenage boys.<br /><br />I couldn&#x27;t help but note that every time Whitely appeared on camera, or
in some cases even close-by off-camera, the script became peppered with
some rather obvious and sophomoric sexual innuendos and
double-entendres accompanied by some rather epic leering. The most
blatant one early on coming from someone commenting on the container La
Beouf&#x27;s medal came in. And, please, no one spoil it for me by claiming
it was unintentional. I, at least, wanted to give the writer credit for
getting away with some originality.<br /><br />Another thing one can&#x27;t help but notice the height disparity between
the two leads, La Beouf and Whitely. I checked and he lists his height
in his bio as an entire quarter of an inch taller than her&#x27;s states.
There seems to be different people playing La Beouf as his height seems
to change up and down by four inches or more throughout the film. Some
of that can be explained by her footwear, but not all of it. One may
wonder why I mention that? I mention it because I was so disinterested
in the &#x22;action&#x22; on screen that I was looking for other things to find
interest in on screen. Still, I have to give credit for any shorter guy
willing to undertake scaling mount Whitely. It must have been very fun
for him.<br /><br />In the long run, I would have much preferred it had they cast a &#x22;real&#x22;
young actress in the role instead of a model. There are a number of
good ones to choose from. For example, Blake Lively (barely shorter),
pixieish Ellen Page, Hilary Duff (Oooo, she can even resemble a tough
girl), Kay or DaniellePanabaker (or maybe both of them, they&#x27;re small),
Hayden Panettiere, Mia Wasikowska (shorter than whazziz name), Aly
Michalka (barely shorter), Emma Roberts (who is charmingly shorter than
that Witwicky guy), Amanda Michalka (also shorter) and, my personal
favorite nominee, Emma Stone (also shorter). See how easy it is? In
conclusion, I will posit that the theater was uncommonly packed, the
most I&#x27;d ever seen on a weekday performance, and the audience uniformly
seemed to like the film a lot. So, I guess that means that they will
make a lot of money which, in turn, will likely generate yet another
sequel.
