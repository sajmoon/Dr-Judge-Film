I was a bit skeptical of this movie because of Rosie
Huntington-Whiteley being the lead female role, but I was surprised
that she actually did a good job! I thought it was good, the plot was a
bit flat at times but I liked the characters and character development
throughout the movie. I liked the visual effects but that wasn&#x27;t the
whole movie as some reviewers said, there is good dialog and it shows
humans for about the same amount of time as transformers. I thought
that plot wise, the second movie is better but the visual effects on
this one took the cake. I think they should end the transformers series
here, if they make another one they are going to drag it out, this
movie was stretching it a bit much. Its going to turn redundant soon.
