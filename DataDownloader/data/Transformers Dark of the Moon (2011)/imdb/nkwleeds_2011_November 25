The first two transformer movies were not bad but this one was
absolutely terrible. The story line was very poor with lots of chaotic
fighting among those transformer until I lost track of who is fighting
who. This movie has nothing but tons of fighting among mechanical
robots all the way especially near the end. I thought the first
transformer movie was not bad. The second one was exciting too so I
presumed the third one was supposed to be good. How disappointed was I.
I also thought that the notion of a magical dagger that became dust can
be used revive a &#x22;dead&#x22; transformer is total joke to science. Not
realistic in many circumstances. I thought transformers were created
based on science.
