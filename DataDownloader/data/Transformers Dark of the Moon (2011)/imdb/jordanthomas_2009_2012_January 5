The visual effects were terrific, the designers and creators are on the
wrong film, they should be working with the top class directors like
Ridley Scott, Spielberg and James Cameron, instead they would have been
better off working on The Smurfs movie, at least there&#x27;s some dignity
there. The amount of money these films have made is unbelievable, i
mean you must like a stronger variety of sci-fi films besides
transformers, cos certain people who have a screw loose on this site
say its the best sci-fi film ever. Im sorry but saying this is the best
without acknowledging the other potential classics out there like Star
Wars, Blade Runner and Alien is a bit mental; and yeah when the critics
say a film is really good it usually is and when they say its bad like
Transformers trilogy it most certainly is!, many people just throw
their valuable opinions aside and waste their money on this trash, this
cant even be classed as a guilty pleasure because it is too slow,
boring and takes its self too seriously. This third instalment just
made me loose hope completely in filmmakers today, I gave it a chance
at the cinemas with hope they stuck to their apology and worked on
their mistakes, just as i thought the dumb franchise couldn&#x27;t possibly
get any worst it does, money wasted, 3 hours i&#x27;ll never get back, the
toys should have stayed in the box this time around. <br /><br />I mean they had a budget of $250 million dollars of the peoples money,
you&#x27;d at least think they could get a better writer, director and cast,
the whole cast acted like mentally i&#x27;ll teenagers; you have Sam
Witwicky who doesn&#x27;t shut up talking rubbish, his parents who are
mentally ill, John Malkovich who acts mentally i&#x27;ll; and the Chinese
dude from the hangover is mentally troubled pulling his pants down in a
cubicle with SAM, seriously is this meant to be funny? plenty of good
screenwriters out there instead of wasting your money on bikinis and
explosions spend it on important things, give the people what they
want!<br /><br />honestly avoid this film at all costs even if a friend lends you it
avoid it, if you see its free online avoid it, if you see it in the
bargain basket avoid it, if you catch it on TV avoid it completely
avoid it you will save yourself a lot of valuable time!
