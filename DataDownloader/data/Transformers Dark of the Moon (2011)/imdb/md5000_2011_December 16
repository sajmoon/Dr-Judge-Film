This has to be one of the worst movies filmed or released in 2011.I
have never seen a movie that has no storyline, no plot, bad acting
,cut-shots for no reason,and a action sequence that last 60 minutes
make- more than 200million at the box office.It really shows how we as
Americans support B.S. Hollywood movies, and kept spending our hard
earned money on crap.Michael Bay should really stop making
movies...starting today.If you have seen Transformers the first
installment of the series, just keep that DVD and play that one over
and over.Please erase your mind the other Transformer movies were ever
released.I really didn&#x27;t think the movies would get worst but they did.
