Wow. Just wow. If you thought that director Michael Bay was going to
take a gentler approach to the third film then be prepared for a
surprise. Dark Of The Moon is huge both in action and in the amount of
CGI. This time the decepticons have a very transformers-like plan to
take over the world. Who stand in their way? Only a small number of
autobots and humans. How good is the film? It&#x27;s somewhere between the
first and the second films. It has only two things going for it: the
fantastic CGI and the impressive 3D presentation. For a film like this
Bay has given up such things as character development, a coherent story
or tight direction. Dark Of The Moon is a mess, but not as much as
Revenge Of The Fallen. Characters come and go for little or no reason.
The humor is awkward, lousy or disgusting. Some scenes are
underdeveloped or unnecessary. The acting is bad or passable. The score
is loud and generic. The American patriotism is, once again, over the
top. A shocker is in store for viewers concerning the American space
program. But the worst thing is that Michael Bay still hasn&#x27;t learned
(or decided to ignore) why the transformers cartoons were likable. The
transformers themselves were real characters, and they looked different
and interesting. In this film it takes some effort to see who&#x27;s who
when they&#x27;re fighting. Dark Of The Moon is a money-making product at
its simplest. It&#x27;s meant to lure audiences with its predictable
combination of humor, action and special effects. It&#x27;s passable
entertainment, but I wouldn&#x27;t watch it a second time. Like the previous
two transformers films Dark Of The Moon is a true product of the Bush
era.
