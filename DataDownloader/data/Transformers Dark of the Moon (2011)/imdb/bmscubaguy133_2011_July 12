This movie is without a doubt the best transformers movie made for
various reasons: one: the characters (humans and robots). two: the
amazing storyline. three: the action sequences. The movie provides
great character building. I started to know the characters and how they
acted. Shia Labouf was awesome, but i also like how in this movie the
autobots had a lot more character to them. When certain autobots die (I
wont say whom) you are filled with emotion and you cared about that
autobot.<br /><br />Second: I liked the storyline in this, it was very solid. There are
like one or two very tiny plot holes but who cares, it did not really
effect the story.<br /><br />Three: The action was the best i&#x27;ve ever seen in my life. That includes
the best special effects ever made. The last hour you will be on the
edge of your seat. You will walk out of the theater amazed and you just
might be tempted to see it again. And for all those negative reviews,
they are so wrong. This movie was awesome. To prove it: the first time
I saw it, the audience cheered about 6 times! Yea go see this movie if
you can.
