The first &#x22;Transformers&#x22; movie was not the best nor the worst movie of
all time, I thought it was just cool summer entertainment, but really
annoying entertainment, with noting excellent or terrible. The second
movie was quite the same thing, only it is a more awful version of how
average the first movie was. Now, Michael Bay wraps up the Transformers
series (well, I hope) with the third installment, &#x22;Dark of the Moon&#x22;,
and let&#x27;s just say that this is more awful than &#x22;Revenge of the
Fallen&#x22;, and I was left thinking, &#x22;How much more awful can this movie
be?&#x22;. No need for me to explain this unexplainable plot, because I
would rather cut to the chase. &#x22;Dark of the Moon&#x22; has everything that a
bad movie can ask for. Once again, this movie hardly has any plot, and
Michael Bay does another terrible directing job and brought so much
more annoying action. Well, I do not hate Shia LaBeouf in these movies,
except when he acts like a screaming, complaining jerk. Also, I felt
really bad about Patrick Dempsey, John Malkovich, and Frances McDormand
who all wasted good performances, when they should have done these
performances in other better movies. But even if the visual effects and
sound are still awesome, they&#x27;re trying to make it annoying. But the
only thing I liked about this movie was Rosie Huttington-Whitely, the
replacement for Megan Fox. I thought that this new girl is a better
actress than Megan Fox, and she is ten times more hot than Megan Fox. I
thought she was really cool, and she shares a better romance with Shia
LaBeouf. All of this is what Megan Fox should have done. But that was
that! With tons of corny dialouge, horrible editing, terrible writing,
annoying visual effects, disgusting violence, hideous directing,
half-well acting, and stupid characters, &#x22;Transformers: Dark of the
Moon&#x22; may be popcorn summer entertainment that will win a billion bucks
in the box office, but I think it&#x27;s too stupid to reach that
accomplishment, and I think it rather deserves a Razzie or two.
&#x22;Transformers: Dark of the Moon&#x22;, in my review, &#x22;a horrible popcorn
movie, such a waste of true movie-making&#x22;.
