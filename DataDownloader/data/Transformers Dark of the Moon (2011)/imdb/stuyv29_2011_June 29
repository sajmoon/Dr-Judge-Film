most people on here never had transformer toys as a kid, therefore they
cannot understand how great it is to watch a cartoon come to life. 1.
People need to stop hating on Michael Bay, what he doing is working ,
look at the ticket sales. 2. If after the first movie you still looking
for character development, go else where. Go watch HP or LOTR, like
they really had it anyway. 3. Transformers falls in a genre that is not
for everyone, it is action, scifi and mecha, plus it was a CARTOON
Finally, go watch it in IMAX 3D , the whole movie is 3D. If there was
one problem i did not get enough of the transformers, which is what the
movie is about, even though it had lots . next time do like 1hr 45 mins
to include the TRANSFORMERS, and the remaining 45mins of humans All in
all great movie
