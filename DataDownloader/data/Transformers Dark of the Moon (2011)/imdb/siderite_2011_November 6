Didn&#x27;t expect anything else and I got exactly that. Like the consistent
experience of a hotel in a chain, you watch this getting exactly what
you paid for. I often wonder if someone dumbs down the scripts in order
to preserve the feel of the franchise, because I can&#x27;t imagine people
getting paid for such ridiculous stories.<br /><br />Other than that, the special effects were a lot of work for the CGI
team, although they didn&#x27;t feel as flashy as those from Transformers 2.
You have a full invasion of a major American city using armies of
Decepticon ships. I liked the idea of the Americans going to the Moon
because there was something there they needed and the Russians not
going because the Americans got there first. If only it was used in a
better movie.<br /><br />The girl is not Megan Fox anymore and, if I thought she was kind of
bland in the previous movie, you should see the new girl. Blonde with
British accent, though. It is all the rave. As another reviewer said:
no heart and soul in this movie, not even as much as in the previous
two.
