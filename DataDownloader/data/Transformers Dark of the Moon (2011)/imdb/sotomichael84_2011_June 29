Here&#x27;s my problem with the critic reviews, they expect too much. If you
come to see the movie expecting to be completely moved by what you&#x27;ve
seen, then you&#x27;ve got another thing coming. This is a great movie for
what it is, a summer action thriller. The story was good not great, and
obviously, the special effects were perfect. Compared to the second
installment, this is a BIG improvement. The second was just trying to
be too funny, and the action was great, but it was just chaotic. In
Dark of the Moon, Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg tuned down the
comedy level and they put in a better structure for the action
sequences. Now, there were still a lot of great laughs, and the special
effects were at best they&#x27;ve ever been, if not better. my only problems
were that I believe that the characters could have been better
developed, but enough was done to get by, and the way it was put
together was just a tad bit messy, but nothing too noticeable. DO NOT
listen to what a bunch of hot-shot movie critics have to say, you
really should never listen to these guys. Overall, this was an awesome,
fun summer blockbuster. You will enjoy yourself, a lot.
