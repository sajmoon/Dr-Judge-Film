Don&#x27;t even read the bad reviews on here! This movie is for the
Transformers Fans!! even the non-fans would enjoy this film. &#x22;no heart
and soul&#x22; -- to that I say come on!! this movie gave me chills 3 or 4
times. This movie has heart and soul and lots of it if you&#x27;re a
Transformers fan. The best movie you will see this year! no doubt about
that. Oh, and watch in 3D. The 3D is amazing!<br /><br />It had been a while since I watched a movie where everyone in the
theater cheered and clapped after a scene. This clapping and cheering
after a scene happened often in this movie, that&#x27;s how good it is! I&#x27;m
definitely watching once or twice again.
