This movie is a real disappointment; it&#x27;s just really bad. Great
special effects. Bad screenplay, overacting, no chemistry (love
interest), no character development, the works. There is absolutely no
connection between audience and the characters. Bay and his team blew
it big time. Big mistake dropping Megan Fox; they should have worked
out their differences. One would think Spielberg would know better. Her
character went through all this stuff with Wiwicky that would forge a
lifetime relationship and it lasted a year, please. I bought the movie
based on the first two; I&#x27;m going to give it away. The next Bay movie
will be low on my list of things to watch.
