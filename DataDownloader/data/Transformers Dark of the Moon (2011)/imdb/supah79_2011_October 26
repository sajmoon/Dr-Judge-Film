What else can I say about this, that already hasn&#x27;t been said? It&#x27;s
big, loud and empty. It&#x27;s dangerously militaristic and gung ho. Like
World Battle: Los Angeles it&#x27;s a video game with clich&#xE9; heroism. It&#x27;s a
live action &#x27;I Want You&#x27; poster.<br /><br />I really can&#x27;t fault Bay here. He&#x27;s an advertising man. He is hired to
sell. And he does. Everything is sly, shiny and slick. Nice slow mo&#x27;s,
nice legs (courtesy of some new hottie) and great musclecars. Hormones,
heroes and guns. Sign up right here. Do your part and earn citizenship.
Oh wait, we&#x27;re not there...just yet.<br /><br />I fault the viewers who buy a ticket to this. That includes yours
truly. Because as long as these things double or triple their budgets,
it&#x27;s still gonna get made. Number 4 is in the making and it&#x27;s our
fault.<br /><br />An awful film that deserves an awful review: 1 out of 10.
