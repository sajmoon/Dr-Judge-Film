2011_December 4 
This one is one of the highest grossing films of all time, they gave
Michael Bay a ton of cash, then he spent it all on a CGI. The acting,
plot and character development is non-existent. It is just a bunch of
mindless special effects one after the other, dragging on for what
seemed eternity, I tried playing it at 1.5x speed, but even then it was
just boring (seemed like the action scenes were on a loop), I cannot
believe people sit through 3 hours of this ****! This movie is just a
waste of money, think of what could be done with this amount of cash
for the improvement of the human species! But after watching this I
feel it is the destiny of human civilization to self-destruct within
the next century or so. Nothing else left to say....
