Alright-- First transformers: Love it. Second One: Heavily Flawed, but
still fun for me. I&#x27;m sorry. I like it. I&#x27;ve watched it many times
thinking it wouldn&#x27;t hold up. It still does.<br /><br />I&#x27;ll start with the good: Plenty of great action scenes involving
humans and Robots alike with just about everyone getting there own bad
ass moment. Bay is great at directing action. The plot, while thin and
similar to the other films, had enough twists and turns and mystery to
keep me invested. There are even a couple of big reveals that I liked.
The acting is competent, though it does stray with some and I even got
some laughs. I also liked the new girl, despite the Liv Tyler lips. I
also like that John Tuturo&#x27;s character wasn&#x27;t all that annoying in this
one. Even Lebouf&#x27;s parents were used to a small degree in this one, and
weren&#x27;t quite as annoying, except for one overly-vulgar joke.<br /><br />Now for the bad, the part most will probably want to love: I said I
liked the new girl, but I liked Megan Fox&#x27;s character a bit better.
Fox&#x27;s character did more in the other films. This girl is pretty much a
damsel in distress the whole time. Another big problem is that
Shockwave is deemed as the film&#x27;s main villain on the IMDb pages. He
ain&#x27;t. He may as well not have been named. He has no real dialogue and
probably fired his gun once. Another false point is that the cameos by
Ken Jeong and John Malcovich. Malchovich serves no purpose and his last
couple of scenes should have been deleted. Jeong is just annoying and I
was so relieved when his character died. No real spoiler there. There
is also some really bad attempts at humor in there, too. The only other
bad thing I can name is that we spend too much time with people. I let
it slip with the first 2, but this time was too much. We needed a few
more scenes with Robots at this point.
