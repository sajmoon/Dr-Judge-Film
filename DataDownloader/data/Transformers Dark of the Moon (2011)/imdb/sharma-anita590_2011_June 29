It is also the best job the series has done so far of turning the
robots themselves into lead characters, something the first two films
avoided for the most part. In the first film, Optimus Prime and
Bumblebee had their moments, but they were still secondary to the human
characters in every way, and the second film didn&#x27;t really give anyone,
human or animated, anything to play. This time out, I actually felt
like the robots made a strong impression, and if there are more of
these films after Bay leaves the series, then he&#x27;s laid out a pretty
strong template here for others to imitate moving forward. Finally, it
feels like the war makes sense, and the stakes make sense, and it all
matters. Sentinel Prime is a great addition to the series, and Nimoy
plays him perfectly. It&#x27;s a real performance, and as a result, it makes
the rest of the Transformers feel more real. Cullen is very good in
this one, and the rest of the robot cast manages to impress as well.
Even the weird little robots, and there are two of them living with Sam
(Shia LaBeouf) grew on me over the course of the film, especially when
you see where they wind up. The Decepticons are way nastier in this
one, and so when Optimus Prime and the Autobots unleash hell... AND
THEY DO... it is so deserved and so worthy of one cheer after another
that it almost becomes audience participation.
