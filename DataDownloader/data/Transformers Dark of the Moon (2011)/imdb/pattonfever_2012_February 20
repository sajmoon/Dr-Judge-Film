This is just a bad film. The worst I have ever seen. Do people not like
things like story, characters, and feeling? I just don&#x27;t get it. And
they will keep making this trash because people keep seeing it. They
already have battleship coming out. When I saw the trailer I first
thought it was a new transformer film. Thank god it wasn&#x27;t, but I know
its coming. I could understand part two. Every one went to see the
first one. So naturally there had to be a two. But when every one saw
how bad part two was why did they go see three? There had to be better
films in theaters to see than this. All I can think of is that we as a
movie going society are getting dumber. While other countries are
making smart films, we are making dumb films. Very embarrassing.
