I just saw this movie tonight in the theatre with my father, and I
enjoyed it a lot. Not as good as the first film but better than the
second one. This film starts off in the 1960&#x27;s and NASA plans a top
secret mission to find out about the spaceship that crash landed on the
moon. There is a lot of action and explosions in this film. It was
directed by Michael Bay so of course there would be lots of explosions
and CGI but I thought it worked perfectly well. Truth be told, I think
Michael Bay is one of the most underrated and less respected filmmakers
of all time. I think it is because he has lots of explosions in his
films. But if you like films with lots of explosions and lots of
action, this is the film for you. I liked this movie more than I
thought I would. I was very sceptical going into the theatre, and I am
glad I saw it. Kudos off to Michael Bay for a job well done. It is a
must see for the people who love the original transformers action
figures, cartoons and the first two transformers films. You will not be
disappointed.
