Before I begin this review I must say that I truly adore and enjoy
Michael Bay films. In addition, I believe that he is a talented
director. That said. Mr. Bay I beg you, Please,do not ever make another
Transformers movie. The entire movie franchise dishonored the original
Hasbro toys and inspired TV series. I honestly don&#x27;t know where to
start. Perhaps with the awful yet beautiful performances by said Megan
Fox in the first two movies. No, wait I&#x27;d rather start with the
&#x22;subliminally&#x22; racist autobots introduced in the second installment of
this film series. I mean really why would you even include those bots? <br /><br />Anyways, This is supposed to be a review the third &#x22;horror&#x22;, I mean
film. Simply put, the movie sucked. I argued with my lady friend to go
see it and in the end I looked like an idiot. Thank you for that by the
way! This truly was a disaster, from the confusing cinematography to a
huge snake that did nothing for the movie it was truly horrible but the
best out of all three.
