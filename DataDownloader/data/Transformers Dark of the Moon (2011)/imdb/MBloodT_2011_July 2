Witwicky The Movie! Once again, Transformers is not focused to the
Transformers but focused to a human being named Sam Witwicky. This is
why I never liked Michael Bay&#x27;s Transformers. This is why I already
predicted &#x22;Revenge of the Fallen&#x22; will fail two years ago because the
movie is not interested with Optimus. How can this series be called
Transformers if it doesn&#x27;t have enough Transformers? The Autobots only
appear when there are Decepticons attacking and the preachy scenes
about them. If there&#x27;s no action, there&#x27;s the life of Witwicky. His
life is never interesting but the film just wants us to show how
important it is. How about less Witwicky and more Optimus? Would it
make the film better? I guess so.<br /><br />Transformers movies never gets a good story. But we still watch these
movies for the Autobots and the explosion and the loud noises. Fact:
The scenes of the Autobots only exist in the action scenes and the
important scenes about them. The rest is all Witwicky and his chick and
his uninteresting &#x26; unimportant life. There are new Transformers in
this film but we never get to know them because it doesn&#x27;t only have
new Transformers, it also have excessive cameos. These celebrity cameos
has more screen time than the robot newbies.<br /><br />The special effects were the only merits of this trilogy. All the
transforming, all the robots, all the explosions, all the stuff jumping
off the screen. Another Fact: The 3D is &#x22;DARKER of the Moon&#x22;. We sure
love the action and the explosion but the climax is focused to Sam
Witwicky&#x27;s survival again, and the soldiers and Witwicky again and his
new girlfriend and Witwicky then Patrick Dempsey(not spoilers dude) and
Witwicky. It&#x27;s all Witwicky! Yeah, there&#x27;s Optimus and Bumblebee but
mostly focused to Witwicky and the humans.<br /><br />Saddest thing is, the scenes of Bumblebee were also moderated. He is
the only Autobot in the series we know the most and loved but here he
is now like Optimus and the rest of the Transformers. Why can&#x27;t they
just call these films &#x22;Sam and the Transformers&#x22; or &#x22;World Invasion:
Chicago and Egypt and LA and other places where the Transformies went&#x22;?
Sounds more credible than &#x22;Transformers&#x22;. I&#x27;m not really trolling Shia
LaBeouf but him as Witwicky is like playing the same roles all over
again. I bet he love Michael Bay for giving him these hot chicks. Rosie
Huntington-Whitely was only cast for her sexy body and giving Sam a
backup. She doesn&#x27;t improve Megan Fox&#x27;s Mikaela Beans.<br /><br />Transformers is supposed to be about the Transformers. But it has more
humans, and Witwicky, and Cameos and Witwicky. I think Michael Bay is
getting lazy. He&#x27;s not taking this movie so seriously and the movie
ends too quickly and he throws a lot of humanity and celebrity cameos
in his excessive runtime. By the way this movie is called
&#x22;Transformers&#x22; not &#x22;Human Celebrities&#x22;. Well, Bay made a grave mistake.
