For those &#x22;critics&#x22; that can only see one star for this amazing film, I
would suggest trying to let your imagination go free and try to realize
that this is &#x22;escapism&#x22;......don&#x27;t over rationalize the physics or the
reality.........The film is a marvel of Special Effects....To the
casual film-goer, simply watch it to be amazed by the advances in
effects. Yes the film has some rather stale acting, and some lame humor
- but the story lends itself well to the trilogy.....It is a well-spent
2+ hours of high definition adventure.... To the &#x22;negative voters&#x22;, I
would suggest trying to relax a bit while watching a new film...It is
entertainment, after-all!!! Enjoy!
