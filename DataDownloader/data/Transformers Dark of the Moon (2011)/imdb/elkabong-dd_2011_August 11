OK, let&#x27;s be fair to this movie. The special effects were great --
assuming you can suspend your belief in physics long enough to enjoy
them. The rest of this movie was awful. <br /><br />The product placements for Lenovo, Cisco, Waste Management and Chevy
Impala were overwhelming. There was a product placed in almost every
scene, and the sheer SIZE of the logo overshadowed most scenes. It was
brutal, even for Michael Bay. <br /><br />And the leading woman (I refuse to look her name up for this review) -
the giant implants she had in her lips gave her that permanent &#x22;duck-
lip&#x22; look. Gross. <br /><br />It&#x27;s sad to see so much of Hollywood&#x27;s money go to tripe like this.
There must be better things to fund. <br /><br />2/10, and all of the &#x22;2&#x22; is special effects.
