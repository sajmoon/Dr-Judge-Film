I really don&#x27;t get all the hate this movie gets.What did people expect
when they saw the trailer? Some drama filled story that will change
their life forever?If i wanted that i will just go watch &#x22;Eternal
Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&#x22; or something of that caliber.The movie
is not trying to impress the people with its story,it knows that his
biggest strength is the amazing effects and its damn sure using it.<br /><br />From the moment the trailer was released i knew what to expect (having
watched the previous 2 Transformer movies)and that&#x27;s what i got,which
was explosions,explosions and more explosions :).<br /><br />Anyways,my main point is that if you enter the cinema with the right
mind set you will really enjoy this movie,but if you expect something
amazing and some 10 star classic with unexpected twists and turns you
will be very disappointed :)
