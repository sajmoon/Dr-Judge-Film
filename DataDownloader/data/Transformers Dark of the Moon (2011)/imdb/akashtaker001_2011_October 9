I saw this movie in 3D despite negative comments by critics. I watched
it because I really like last two movies of the franchise. And let me
tell you that I didn&#x27;t made a mistake. It was the most incredible movie
I have seen so far. Its a brilliant treat for the eyes to see the mind
blowing special effects, 3D is the icing on the cake. But bear in mind
just keep your logical, critic mind at home. The plot is really thin
and acting is average but this is not a Citizen Kane. The action is
like never seen before. Also I am a big fan of Megan Fox therefore I
was disappointed because of her absence. Also Rosie&#x27;s acting is really
robotic. But she fulfills her purpose in the movie for providing the
much required eye-candy. On the whole if you are really a fan of action
and special effects I bet you won&#x27;t be disappointed.
