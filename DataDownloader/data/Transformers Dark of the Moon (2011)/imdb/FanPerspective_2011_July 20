While many did not like Michael Bay&#x27;s Transformers: Revenge of the
Fallen (Bay, himself, included), I really enjoyed the film. But, for
those who didn&#x27;t, despite what critics had to say, you will love this
dark and action-packed finale to this amazing trilogy! In the fashion
of the previous two films, Dark of the Moon takes a turn at giving
history a little rewrite. This time with the explanation of the big
space race in 1969. It turns out that we actually ventured to the moon
to explore an alien spacecraft that had crashed landed there, unaware
that it belonged to the Autobots. Years later when Optimus Prime learns
of its existence, he retrieves the precious cargo and returns it to
Earth, in hopes to keep it safe and away from the Decepticons.<br /><br />I saw this film twice in theaters and it is just everything you could
hope for in the final better and more! Of course, in true Michael Bay
style, there are a lot of explosions and much destruction, but also
there is a solid storyline that features a brilliant and totally
unexpected twist! This film definitely took a darker turn compared to
the others, and I dare say that it is the best of them! It did feel a
bit off having Megan Fox gone, but Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was able
to come in and give her character life that aided into the masterfully
crafted story. Along with the returning cast, a few other new editions
were added, such as the wonderful John Malkovich and Frances McDormand!
We also were introduced to some awesome new Transformers, which
included my personal favorite, Shockwave, who was able to branch out
into this mechanical snake-like creature.<br /><br />It&#x27;s sad to think that the end came so quickly, but it couldn&#x27;t have
ended more perfectly! It&#x27;s just an exciting ride that is packed with
action, explosions, laughs, twists and turns, and heart. Not to mention
that while most films gain nothing extra from being in 3-D (except for
$3 more from your wallet), this movie was what the 3-D technology was
made for! It was just spectacular.. especially during the action
sequences (which were aplenty)!
