Let me start off by saying that the 3D in this movie was just mind-
blowing, i mean if its all that you&#x27;re looking for, a great 3-d
experience, then heres your movie. The scene that really stood out
though was the one with the flying humans, (I don&#x27;t want to spoil
anything, you&#x27;ll know what im talking about when you see it, if you
already haven&#x27;t). The whole movie was made with surreal clarity, that
the 3D effects really were very effective.<br /><br />The CGI, was also top notch, as is the case with Bay&#x27;s movies, i
especially enjoyed the sequences where the transformers &#x27;transformed&#x27;
while crashing into one another. The tracking shots were also quite
well done, especially the ones in space.<br /><br />The pacing in this movie was not much of a problem for me, as the
action sequences that followed one another, had a very good flow to
them. Although it did lag in the middle.<br /><br />And now heres what this movie got wrong, and what i think the whole
franchise got wrong... The Acting... I mean yes the graphics were just
stunning, but i didn&#x27;t get that satisfaction that i wished for as the
acting efforts in this movie were almost nill. I wont bother bashing
the new leading actress, as i think her scenes in the trailers speak
for themselves. But come on, there was no character development on the
part of Shia&#x27;s character, nor was Shia&#x27;s acting as a whole any better,
actually his character, did come of as a bit annoying, especially the
way he tried to talk. Patrick Dempsey was a pleasant addition though.<br /><br />So overall, this movie&#x27;s Pros: 1)It is a visual treat and its 3D is in
the right place, i would rank it just below Avatar&#x27;s. 2)The sound
mixing was also quiet spectacular.<br /><br />.. and its Cons: 1) the score wasn&#x27;t anything special. 2) The acting
was quite wooden 3) The plot did not make any sense, but that&#x27;s nothing
new.
