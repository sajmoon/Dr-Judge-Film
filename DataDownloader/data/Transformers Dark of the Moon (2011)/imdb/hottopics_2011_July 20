The popularity of the Transformers movies is very strong around the
world at the moment. Being one of those people who grew up with the
action figures and animated series it has been exciting to watch the
movies so far with the first of the franchise films being created in
2007. Perhaps the Revenge of the Fallen (2009) was not as successful as
the first instalment of the Transformers however, the release of the
Dark of the Moon looks to already be impressing with the Transformers
Craze well and truly alive.<br /><br />If that alone doesn&#x27;t convince you that the craze is here, then perhaps
a website dedicated to showing off all things transformers around the
world that people own or make will, at www.thetransformerscrazy.com you
will be shown how crazy this craze really is. Making her spectacular
film debut is the gorgeous UK model Rosie Huntington Whiteley, as
Carly, Sam Witwicky&#x27;s girlfriend, who has turned out to be the perfect
replacement for Megan Fox. The plot picks up with Sam being unemployed
and fresh out of college finding that he has to prove his place in the
world. Sam struggles to show what he has so far done to save the world
due to the government silence agreements and continues to try and prove
his significance.<br /><br />Although the plot is quite basic it at least has a plot around all that
action. The first manned mission to the moon was revealed to be in
relation to the alien spaceship that had crash-landed on the surface.
The Arc as it is known belonged to the sentient machines known as the
Autobots, who are working for the US government as peacekeeping
mercenaries .The contents of The Arc, possessed the power to allow the
Autobots and Optimus prime to defeat the evil Decepticons.<br /><br />Sam and the Autobots set out on a mission to revive and rescue Sentinel
Prime. The evil Megatron and the Decepticons become a threat wreaking
havoc. The plot could have been thought out a little better, however
the action made up for what the plot lacked. As can be seen from the
trailer the action makes it a worthwhile movie not to mention Rosie
Huntington Whiteley playing the perfect girlfriend.<br /><br />The visual effects and sound design are the best that I have seen in a
while it has to be said and technically speaking has to be rated as the
best this year. For any transformers fan a must see and for those who
are not still entertaining!
