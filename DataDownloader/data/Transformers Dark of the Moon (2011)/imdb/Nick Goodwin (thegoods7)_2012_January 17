Transformers Dark of the Moon being the third movie of the Transformers
series you wouldn&#x27;t think it would be as good as the first two, well it
is. In this movie Megan Fox is no longer to be seen but we are gifted
with a beautiful Rosie Huntington-Whiteley playing along side Shia
LaBeouf. This movie added some serious effects to it with the robots.
just like the first two it combines an action/love/comedy attribute.
The action scenes in this movie are without a doubt awesome. The
effects they used are amazing and to sort of let you catch up with
whats happening they use slow motion to let you see things that are
going on. I like how they&#x27;ve taken something that has actually happened
like the moon landing and have put there own twist on what actually was
happening. this was a very good movie and would recommend it to anyone
interested in seeing robots you played with as kid come to life.
