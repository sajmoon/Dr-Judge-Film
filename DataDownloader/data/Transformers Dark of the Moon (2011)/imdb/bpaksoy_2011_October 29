I thought Megan&#x27;s acting was a bit light and shallow even for a movie
like Transformers but not after seeing Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. I
think the two main problems are the weak story line and Rosie. This is
of course not a romantic movie but even a pre-schooler would show more
passion for her boyfriend and look more convincing than &#x22;Carly&#x22; does
for &#x22;Sam&#x22;. She is right in the middle of historic and sometimes very
dangerous events, yet she sounds and occasionally looks more like she
is in a fashion show. Despite Rosie, I think the movie starts pretty
nice with the Apollo story and John Malkovich and the visual effects
are extremely good throughout the movie but not enough to cover the
weaknesses. And for god&#x27;s sake (and I have two mention that I am not an
American), what is a British girl with of course a British accent and
quite poor in acting doing in a movie that looks, sounds and feels so
American? Rosie&#x27;s inaptitude for acting made me feel like a bit I am
watching a British sci-fi TV show with mediocre visual effects and
story line like Dr. Who. I want Megan Fox back please!
