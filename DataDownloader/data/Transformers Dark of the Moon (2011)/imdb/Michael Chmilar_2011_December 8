This movie is terrible in so many ways that it is impossible to
articulate them all. Usually, with a bad movie, it is easy to say, &#x22;It
is bad because of this, this, and this,&#x22; but with Framstorners: Bark at
the Moon, the problem is that everything in it is terrible.<br /><br />The basic storyline is not too bad, and in the hands of another
director, it could have been a decent 90 minute action sci-fi movie.
Michael Bay makes it 60 minutes too long, and fills it with a bunch of
Michael Bay rubbish that does not need to be there.<br /><br />Other reviewers have done an excellent job of pointing out the many
different reasons why this movie is horrible. I think that Michael Bay
has been injecting testosterone directly into his brain stem, and it
has made him insane. How else could someone make a huge-budget movie
and not care about plot, characters, dialog, physics, or having even a
tiny shred of respect for his audience?<br /><br />And to top it off, why does everyone in the film have orange skin
tones? Every person looks like an Oompa-Loompa. They look like they&#x27;ve
been hanging out with John Boehner in the spray tan booth.
