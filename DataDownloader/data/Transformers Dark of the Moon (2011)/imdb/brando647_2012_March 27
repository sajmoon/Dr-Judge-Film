REVENGE OF THE FALLEN was an abomination. Seriously, it was crap. I was
a fan of the first TRANFORMERS movie, but the second was almost enough
for me to write off the series completely. Now, I understood that there
was a lot of behind-the-scenes trouble during the second movie&#x27;s
development/production, so when the time came that the third movie,
DARK OF THE MOON, was to be released I could barely muster any
interest. I almost passed on it, but I enjoyed the first movie enough
and the reviews coming out claiming that the third film was actually
decent blockbuster fodder convinced me to give it a shot. I did, and
I&#x27;m happy to say that it was a lot better than I expected. Not good
enough to rank as one of the best movies of 2011, but fun enough that I
haven&#x27;t totally given up hope on the franchise (because let&#x27;s be
honest, this series isn&#x27;t done yet&#x85;not while it keeps making bank at
the box office). In this movie, it&#x27;s explained that America&#x27;s sudden
eagerness to reach the moon during the 60&#x27;s space race was the result
of a mysterious craft&#x27;s crash landing. The first men to walk on the
moon discovered a Cybertronian secret that would remain buried for
decades. In present day, Optimus Prime and the Autobots are angered to
discover that the humans have been keeping this secret from them and
demand access to the craft and it&#x27;s contents. We discover that the
craft is the Ark, a ship sent from Cybertron during the war containing
a secret to ensure the continuing survival of the Cybertronian race.<br /><br />For starters, I should mention that the story in this movie is actually
coherent. It&#x27;s amazing how much better things turn out when your
writers aren&#x27;t on strike. The plot is pretty slim (though I love the
premise: integrating man&#x27;s first landing on the moon with the
Transformers canon), but that&#x27;s to be expected in a movie where the big
interest is the visuals. If there&#x27;s one thing that can be counted on in
a Transformers movie, it&#x27;s that the CG will be spectacular. They&#x27;ve had
three movies to perfect these effects, so yeah, they&#x27;re pretty awesome.
Quick complaint about the CG: the computer-generated JFK. It sucked and
stuck out horribly. The Transformers themselves look great and the
action is seamless and intense. The battles in this movie are done a
lot better than in the previous movie because you can actually see what
is going on. With that said, I&#x27;ve got to say&#x85;the fights in this movie
are pretty brutal. I was surprised. I mean, the whole series is based
on a collection of children&#x27;s toys and a cartoon. When the Transformers
fight in this movie, robots are being dismembered. &#x22;Blood&#x22; is spurting.
Death gurgles. Heads ripped off and even a &#x22;spine&#x22; being ripped out.
Seriously, you replace the robots with humans in this movie and you&#x27;ve
got a hard-R rated action film. I&#x27;m not complaining, I&#x27;m just&#x85;wow. A
bit out of place but pretty cool nonetheless.<br /><br />There&#x27;s a lot of action in this movie. The last 45 minutes in the movie
is a non-stop action sequence as Sam and the Autobots infiltrate a
Decepticon-devastated Chicago. But, unlike the overlong action ending
in REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, this one entertains. The majority of the
regular cast returns here: Shia LeBeouf, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro,
etc. Even Sam&#x27;s parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White) get some screen
time, though mercifully less than in the second movie. The only one
missing is Megan Fox. Oh well. Her character was nothing more than eye
candy in both of the first movies so, plot-wise, she won&#x27;t be missed.
Nope, director Michael Bay merely replaced her with a different piece
of eye candy, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. A Victoria&#x27;s Secret model,
Rosie&#x27;s acting history is limited. But that&#x27;s OK, because the only
thing this character needs to do in Michael Bay&#x27;s Transformer movies is
look good in slow motion and show off the goods when necessary. And
that&#x27;s all she does. Mission accomplished? Speaking of Michael Bay, I
guess he&#x27;s had a good run with the Transformers series but, in my
opinion, it&#x27;s time for him to let go. Let another director have a
chance to bring these larger-than-life robots to the big screen. He&#x27;s
done well (ok, except for FALLEN) but his shtick is getting stale. His
obsession with the military is becoming overbearing in these movies. I
get it, he likes the armed forces and has some friends inside that let
him use the cool stuff. But I didn&#x27;t come to this movie to see Bay&#x27;s
military toys, I came to watch giant robots kick each other&#x27;s butts.
Enough, man. I also think the character of Sam Witwicky has run his
course. Let him remain as a supporting character in future films, but
pass the torch to a new leading man. New director, new characters, more
robots. Time for an overhaul. Well, time will tell where this series
will go in the future (and there&#x27;s already a release date scheduled for
a fourth film). On the bright side, DARK OF THE MOON was fun enough
that I&#x27;m willing to see another in theaters. If you were a fan of the
first movie, then DARK OF THE MOON probably won&#x27;t disappoint you.
