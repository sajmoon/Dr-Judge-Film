I never thought I would find this one beautiful. I&#x27;ve never been a fan
of the first and second one, but I like them nonetheless. When I found
out my Mom was going to make me watch this, I had low expectations.<br /><br />But after I watched the film, I realized I was wrong. The movie pulls
it off. I never thought I would like this one but ended up LOVING it.
This is a simple tale of freedom and the will to claim it against all
odds. The acting was top-notch, and I have to give Rosie
Huntington-Whiteley due credit for making a great performance which is
not bad for a first-timer. Shia was as usual excellent and so were the
other actors. Their performances complement the simplistic storyline to
give it a kick it deserves.<br /><br />And finally, there are the Autobots and Decepticons. They have been the
CGI masterpieces that they are ever since the first one, and now it
seems they&#x27;ve just secured their spot as the most charming CG robots on
Earth and Cybertron. (Yes, I found even Megatron quite great.) In Dark
of the Moon, they are not just rendered robots but somehow, the makers
were able to breathe personality and even more life into all of them.
Kudos to Michael Bay for directing this great third act to the
Transformers franchise. I just wish there is no more 4th film as it
might ruin the greatness in the series.<br /><br />10/10
