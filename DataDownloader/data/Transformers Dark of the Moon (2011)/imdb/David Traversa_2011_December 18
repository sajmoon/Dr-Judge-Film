The overflow of gags (visual and spoken ones) is so inexhaustible that
after 10 minutes you can imagine the rest of the movie and what they
will do and say, everything in it is that predictable. In a way that&#x27;s
a good reminder to turn off the DVD player right there, save
electricity and help you to take a good book from your forgotten
bookshelves and improve your mind a bit.<br /><br />I wonder what consequences this kind of movies will entail to three
year old minds, not only with those million catastrophes per second
happening on the screen, but especially with those moronic dialogs the
flesh characters deliver to one another...(I don&#x27;t dare to include here
the more than simplistic and banal words uttered by the robots...).<br /><br />The stultifying thing is that some ADULTS (&#xBF;&#xA1;!?) have told me that this
is a good movie... (were these adults fed this kind of garbage when
they were three years old???).<br /><br />Well, fortunately it&#x27;s THEIR problem.<br /><br />Do not waste your time with this flagrantly ridiculous kind of cinema.
