I liked the first 2 movies. Good for pretty much everybody, clean
language, heroic, good cohesive story and dialog. Do not expect the
same thing in this one. Did the director or the writer get a blow in
the head or something since the last movie? Transformers 3 is horrible.
It was hard to follow, Rosie was modeling another new dress or new
lingerie on the screen, her acting was not entirely bad however she did
not appeal to me as a nice character. Megan Fox did so, and I was
actually complaining about her acting before. Not any more. There is
now a new level zero for acting. Also, the language was so foul and I
am not a puritan, but I don&#x27;t think I have heard so much cussing before
in just one movie. They did not cuss much at all in the previous
movies. This was a cussing extravaganza. I consider it of VERY bad
taste in that respect. And all that paired with hard to follow action
and dialog, spiced with many cuss words to maybe hide the lack of
substance and deliver a shock in a different way? Get it together
folks. Do your homework better next time. Do not recommend to anybody,
save your money and nerves.
