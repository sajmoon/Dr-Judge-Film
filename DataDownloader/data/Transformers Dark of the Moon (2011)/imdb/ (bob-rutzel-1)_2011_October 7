Transformers (2011) (Dark Side of the Moon) Shia LaBeouf, Josh Dumahel,
John Tuturro, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, John Malcovich, Patrick
Dempsey, Frances McDormand. <br /><br />The Good Robots (Autobots) and the Bad Robots (Decepticons), who want
to destroy the earth are at it again. That is all you really need to
know.<br /><br />Give us a break. However, if you want to experience bad acting
throughout, listen to dubbed dialogue, watch disjointed scenes, sit
through never-ending Robot battles, listen to mumbling dialogue when it
isn&#x27;t dubbed and be exposed to a very weak script, then this is for you
(don&#x27;t hold back Bob, tell us how you really feel).<br /><br />The CGI is wonderful, but wonderful CGI does not a movie make. The
Robot fighting scenes go on for too long, probably still going on, but
they are spectacular. Can&#x27;t deny that. And, they even threw in some
really good eye-catching landscape scenery, but no one worked on the
story. I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was going on for the longest time
except to (kind of) figure out that the Decepticons wanted to destroy
the earth. Again, that is all you really need to know. Game On. <br /><br />People lie to me all the time. Some said this was better than the other
Transformers movies. HA! None were any good. <br /><br />Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, not much but some.
