Where do we begin?<br /><br />Plot - infantile at best; Dialogue - banal (and couldn&#x27;t understand
Shia at all); Bad guys - predictable; Cameos - people turning up for no
apparent reason. What was Frances McDormand thinking? John Turturro
only there because he was in the other films. John Malkovich? No idea
why actors who can act were in a film that didn&#x27;t require them to do
it. Oh, right. Turn up, breeze through it, bank a whole lot of money.
Shame on you; Casting - was it names out of a hat?; Characteristion -
Michael Bay not bothered about that; Diversity Policy - offensive
racial stereotyping all the way.<br /><br />On the up side, the Transformers and the effects were brilliant. Pity
they got such a small look in.<br /><br />Didn&#x27;t even get to the end of it. Couldn&#x27;t have cared less about 30
minutes from the end. I was hoping that the Decipticons would destroy
the civilisation that had brought us this drivel. No such luck.
