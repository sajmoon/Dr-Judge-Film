Everyone knows Michael Bay basically makes movies to display incredible
action scenes with CGI thrown in everywhere. South Park even has Bay in
an episode to poke fun at his lack of ideas for an actual plot. That
being said, guess what the new Transformers offers...?<br /><br />If you guessed another action packed flick with not much else to offer,
then you&#x27;re correct.<br /><br />Now I gave Dark of the Moon a 7 solely based on the fact that the fight
scenes blew me away. Michael Bay is obviously good at one thing, and he
shows it off in this one. The majority of the fighting takes place in
downtown Chicago, and it was exciting to see how the action integrated
with the layout of the city. Buildings are taken out left and right,
glass shattering everywhere, pretty much complete chaos. <br /><br />I can go on and on about the battle between the Autobots and the
Decepticons, but you kind of know what to expect there. What I got
tired of was the unbelievably stupid plot. Almost every 5 or 10 minutes
I was literally putting my hands in the air and saying, &#x22;Are you
serious?&#x22; I&#x27;m not going to delve into the details, because I want you
to go see the movie for yourself and see what I am talking about, but
just know what you&#x27;re getting into.<br /><br />Several other reviews I read talk about how certain things in the movie
were unrealistic. A few folks went on to complain about the way a
machine crashing on the moon would create a different reaction. C&#x27;mon
people, you&#x27;ve got to let some things slide. I accept the fact that it
is a movie, but of course there are still certain issues you cannot
look past. <br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed Dark of the Moon because I&#x27;m an action junkie. The
fight sequences in this Transformers blow the other movies out of the
water, but don&#x27;t get your hopes up that all will make sense. Obvious
flaws are abundant, but it&#x27;s still worth the watch.
