I was never a huge transformers fan, but having just seen the first one
and loving it and then watching the second and being utterly confused
and unimpressed i was a bit skeptical about watching the last of the
three. I went anyway and was utterly blown away. I have read some of
the reviews on this website and find that this movie did not live up to
the standard of those who are fans of the original transformer movies.
I was never a huge fan so for me this movie was great. I would firstly
like to point out the greatness of the soundtrack in this movie. Its
mind blowing and makes the action and drama scenes much more intense.
It fits in so perfectly as well. This is something that has not been
touched upon by reviewers, and i personally think was missed by most
people. ITS AMAZING. Secondly, visual effects, of course! thats an
obvious one, but one that should be mentioned anyway for its greatness!
Sure, we wont be talking about these visual effects in 20-30 years
time, but right now, this is one of the best i have ever seen and i was
truly amazed. Thirdly, Shia&#x27;s acting, you may judge me on this, but i
think it was his best from all three, and his comedy was spot on and
hilarious! As for the whole story and plot, i think its based on
opinion, i thoroughly enjoyed it and thought it was carried out very
nicely. Not the strongest part of the film of course, but not low
enough for me to score a 1/10, definitely now. The only thing i would
downgrade this movie for is the poor acting of rosie (Carly) but for me
Patrick Dempsey, Shia LaBoeuf and Josh Duhamel all receive a 10/10. Im
not sure if this review makes any sense because this is just me
rambling after seeing so many negative reviews! Don&#x27;t hate me, but i
LOVED this movie! i would pay to watch it again! Best out of the three
for me!
