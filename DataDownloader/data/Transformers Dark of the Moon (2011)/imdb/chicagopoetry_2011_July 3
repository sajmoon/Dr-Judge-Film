2011_July 3 
Okay, right, the plot is confusing. Okay, right, the acting doesn&#x27;t
amount to more than some screaming and yelling and macho poses. Okay,
the most absurd casting in the history of film was made by putting
British supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in the role of the main
lead and love interest. She slides down collapsing buildings, runs
though explosions with shrapnel flying everywhere, crawls through
burning pits of smoky ash, and doesn&#x27;t so much as smudge her white
sweater or show a single emotion besides sticking out her big pouty
lips and speaking a few lines as if lobotomized. But besides all of
this, Transformers 3 is pure bubblegum, two and a half hours of
explosions and robot violence with at least an hour of Chicago getting
attacked that rivals the destruction in any other movie. What do you
expect from yet another sequel to a movie based on Hasbro toys? Clint
Eastwood giving Meryl Streep a bouquet of fleshly picked flowers? If
you want action and over the top special effects this movie is top
notch, but if you expect anything else, why go see a movie called
Transformers 3 in the first place? I thought it was a lot of fun.
