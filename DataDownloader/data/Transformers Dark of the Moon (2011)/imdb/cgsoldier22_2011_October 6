I hate it when people rate some movies just because the story was
clich&#xE9; or predictable, did it ever occur to those people that wasn&#x27;t
the goal in some movies. there&#x27;s plenty of other great movies with a
great storyline, and that was what they wanted. Movies are made for you
to escape reality and be entertained. thats what transformers 3 is
about! Entertaining you with some badass robot action! Who cares about
how intelligent the story was, that wasn&#x27;t Micheal bays intention. his
intention is to show u some crazy action. this movie is so awesome! and
really if u think about it, are you really gonna expect a smart
storyline about alien robots? NO! ur gonna get a normal action movie
storyline, but with amazing effects. bay outdid himself with the
effects. Some of the best action scenes I&#x27;ve ever seen. that was why i
went to go see this, to see alien robots beat the hell out of each
other. i saw the movie for what it was, a badass action flick! I 100%
recommend this movie if you&#x27;re looking for a fun time and some of the
greatest special effects in a long time.
