Best movie out of the three! I mean I thought the first one was good,
this one is even better! Michael Bay did an outstanding job of creating
a fun filled action movie! There&#x27;s so much action in this movie that
it&#x27;s unbelievable. All the Actors in it including Shia Labouf, John
Turturro, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Rosie Huntington Whitely and all
the rest were fantastic!!! Congratulations Michael Bay for making the
Best Action movie out there. Ignore all the haters and people who have
no idea what good of a movie this is. Love you Michael Bay!!!!! Kinda
reminds you of 9/11 it was great! Excellent, Fantastic, Cool, Great,
Awesome and so many other words to describe this movie! Long Live
Transformers Dark of The Moon!!!<br /><br />Please no hate comments.
