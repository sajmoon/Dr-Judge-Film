It&#x27;s been a while since I last came across such a good romance-comedy.
The movie has interconnected stories, A loves B, B loves C, C loves D,
and it goes around and around. The relationships between characters
were portrayed very subtle, so that whenever realizing something new,
I&#x27;d go &#x22;Oh, so that&#x27;s it!&#x22;. Despite being a romance-comedy, there are
some touching moments, one of such was when Emily was calling Cal.<br /><br />The movie features a strong cast, albeit not your current hot stars.
All managed to give a memorable and empathetic performance.<br /><br />Although the story spanned an extended set of characters, the plot line
remained tight and deep. Highly recommended for in-love couples,
married couples, and all the single out there who is still dreaming
about an eternal love.<br /><br />For more reviews, please visit http://voicemotion.wordpress.com/
