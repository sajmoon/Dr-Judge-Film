I could hardly wait for Hangover 2, it was terrible. Bad Teacher,
another disappointment. All the funny lines were ran together for the
previews and that was it. Horrible Bosses had potential but the
characters were too dumb to be believable. Crazy, Stupid Love was
finally a different story, just a simple, touching comedy. Not roll on
the floor, but thoroughly enjoyable to the very end. I would see it
again. I happen to think Steve Carell is one of the best comedic actors
and he proved it again in this movie.The surprise for me was how funny
Ryan Gosling was. I would never have pictured him playing a character
that I really liked. And Marisa Tomei was really an extra bonus, she
was perfect for her part.
