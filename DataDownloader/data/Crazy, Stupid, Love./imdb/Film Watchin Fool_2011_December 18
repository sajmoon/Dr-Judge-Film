Watch this if...you are up for a realistic romantic comedy with
substance. It is as good as advertised.<br /><br />Acting/Casting: 7* - A really nice job casting the right people for the
right roles in this movie. It is full of great actors who all do a
great job playing their roles.<br /><br />Directing/Cinematography/Technical: 7* - Very well put together and
manages to be really entertaining although the content isn&#x27;t
necessarily kind to the fact.<br /><br />Plot/Characters: 7* - A recently divorced man cheated on by his wife
meets a younger ladies man that helps reinvent himself with women, but
he ends up getting more than he bargained for in the end.<br /><br />Entertainment Value: 7* - More realistic and serious than your run of
the mill romantic comedy, but that is what makes it entertaining and
easy to identify with. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a good
romantic comedy with substance.<br /><br />My Score: 7+7+7+7 = 28/4 = 7.0
