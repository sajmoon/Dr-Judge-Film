Well i saw Crazy, Stupid, Love wasn&#x27;t expecting much but this movie is
so funny. I always had liked Steve Carell for his funny acts but in
this movie his funny and emotional both and i really like it. Ryan
Gosling at its best. I didn&#x27;t liked much his Drive movie but in this he
is awesome, cool and funny too. Emma Stone the cute and cuddly though
sexy has given good performance. Jonah Bobo as Steve Carell&#x27;s son in
this has his own issues of love.<br /><br />This movie is related among some characters who are tit-tat related to
each other. One of the ending scene is seriously funny.<br /><br />You should definitely watch it.......
