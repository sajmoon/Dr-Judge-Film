Crazy Stupid Love works because it put a lot of focus on characters,
casting the right people and pure cynical-ism in the mix. Steve Carell
is outstanding as the tormented soul turned player/father and Emma
Stone steals scenes like she always does. As for Ryan Gosling, he is
almost unrecognisable as a ladies&#x27; man. One of the best pick up line
involves responding to a female target with &#x22;boring and impress me&#x22;.
Still, this film isn&#x27;t about picking up, but rather about life and more
defined &#x96; the process of life in general. Unlike most films, the ending
here does not really matter, but rather the long process of getting
there. A good film with good acting and probably something to say in
the process as well&#x85; <br /><br />Neo rates it 7.5/10.
