A four star comedy, but a three star film; if you get my drift. They
should have another Oscar for comedy films.<br /><br />A very funny movie throughout. All the characters are wonderful; as is
the script. There are a couple of scenes that go on a bit longer than I
felt they should; but, no to any serious detriment.<br /><br />This interlocking film is the &#x22;Crash&#x22; of comedies - multiple story
lines, weaving back and forth; finally all coming together at the end
(well, not quite the end) in one hilarious and somewhat slapstick, yet
still poignant scene.<br /><br />Not &#x22;Blues Brothers&#x22; funny; but, I&#x27;ll see it often, over the next few
years, I am sure.
