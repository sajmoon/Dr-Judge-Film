There was a lot of buzz when this movie released. I was never a Steve
Carell fan so I didn&#x27;t care about watching it. But when my friends were
discussing about it as if they had just watched &#x27;The Hangover&#x27; I
thought of giving it a try. The movie got hold of me right when it
started and within minutes I was glued to my chair. The plot was very
interesting and the movie was hilarious all the way through. When it
comes to acting, Ryan Gosling was simply outstanding(Steve Carell did a
great job too). The whole movie turned out to be really unpredictable
and crazy. I recommend this movie to anyone who&#x27;s looking for an
innovative plot in romance comedies. To sum up, I think this movie
deserves TWO THUMBS WAY UP.
