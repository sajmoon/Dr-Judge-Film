This movie is good. There are a few faults, but overall it is one of
the better movies about relationships and different kinds of love. It&#x27;s
not a laugh a minute film but it is a laugh out loud film when it is
funny. The silly title suggests a more comical plot but it has more of
a laid back not over sentimental feel. Enjoyed Steve&#x27;s makeover that
wasn&#x27;t too extreme. The different aspects of the plot lines come
together very nicely. One part I found very realistic but amusing was
the take on divorce from the man&#x27;s point of view and the relationships
that fill the void. Julianne Moore is a bit haggard looking. Steve is
his usual self - lucky the movie doesn&#x27;t rely too much on him looking
helpless as usual. Ryan is cool, good to see him out of his usual
serious role he could do more comedy. Emma isn&#x27;t very beautiful but she
is expressive so interesting to watch. The kids who played the baby
sitter and son could have been more endearing - they were a little bit
unappealing. A few faults: It is a bit draggy in parts. Some scenes
could have been shortened and cut. Some cringe inducing parts could
have been left out. I think the director needed to tighten the story
and cut about 15 minutes or so. Also there are some times when the
characters reactions could have been toned down. There are some over
reactions eg Marisa Tomei&#x27;s. Overall still very enjoyable.
