When Steve Carrell left The Office, I was about as sad as I have ever
been about a TV show. When Ryan Gosling struggled in both Half Nelson
and Blue Valentine, I was about as sad as I have ever been about a
movie. With those two statements being said, I really wanted a light
romantic comedy, I was tired of all the sadness. I am glad to report I
actually did not get that, at least not out of Steve Carrell&#x27;s plot. I
could have never imagined this film working as a drama..but now I could
never imagine it working as a comedy. While Gosling is charming and
does create a good amount of laughs in the film, the main focus is on
Carrell&#x27;s character, who&#x27;s just a sad sack character. That being said,
I loved not only Cal (Carrell&#x27;s character), but I also loved Carrell
himself in the film. Now that James Spader is joining The Office, and
now that Carrell is throwing himself into a dramatic role, and doing a
very good job at it, I could see myself really not missing Michael
Scott much at all. Also, there are a lot of attractive women in this
film, such as Emma Stone, Julianne Moore, and Marisa Tomei. They all
have really good plots as well, especially Marisa Tomei. Kevin Bacon is
also quite funny as Moore&#x27;s co-worker/new boyfriend. To end my review,
I must mention Robbie (Jonah Bobo) falling in love with Jessica
(Analeigh Tipton), which I may have even liked more than Gosling or
Carrell&#x27;s plot. It&#x27;s such a sweet plot, and Tipton and Bobo are rising
young stars. Overall, don&#x27;t go into Crazy Stupid Love expecting
Carrell&#x27;s next Date Night or Gosling&#x27;s next Blue Valentine, go in
expecting something in between those two. If you wish for either of
those two and not the other, you&#x27;re going to be disappointed,
otherwise, just like me, you&#x27;ll love it.
