There is some great acting, hilarious one liners, and a few hopeless
romantics. It is very idealistic, a little over the top at the end, but
I really enjoyed it!<br /><br />This was definitely a comedy. It was really funny with lots of one
liners to keep you laughing! It is also very romantic, you are striving
for these couples to make it through. But it was very different from
other romantic comedies. This is mainly because the story is told from
the men&#x27;s perspective. The men are the ones cheated on and damaged
trying to pick up the pieces. This made the whole dynamic of the movie
very different. It also was not happy-go-lucky through most of the
movie. There was a lot of down-in-the-dumps moments, but yet again,
somehow misery is hilarious!<br /><br />My favorite part was the acting! Steve Carell perfectly portrays a 40-
something man who&#x27;s let himself go a bit. He hilariously shows this
character that is downtrodden and the opposite of hip trying to turn
his life around. His chemistry with Julianne Moore is questionable at
times, but I think you are still fighting for these two throughout the
movie. Ryan Gosling was also perfect as the confident, studly,
womanizer who takes Carell&#x27;s character under his wing. These two have
great chemistry perfectly showing a man&#x27;s perspective of relationship
struggles. The casting of these two is great for a movie centered on
the men! Emma Stone did a great job also. Her chemistry with Gosling
was believable and romantic. This is a more mature role for her. She
plays a mature woman about to begin her law career, much different than
a high school hottie.<br /><br />This movie, like many romantic comedies, was very idealistic!
Everything is grand gestures and ends conveniently. But we have our own
lives for depressing story lines, a little idealism won&#x27;t hurt while we
are at the movies. The ending is over the top. I do think it could have
been wrapped up in a way that was a little more believable. I don&#x27;t
like to reveal too much, so that&#x27;s about all I can say about that.<br /><br />Overall, I had fun watching this movie. It was funny! It had some great
acting and hilarious lines and moments. It is idealistic and doesn&#x27;t
have the best ending, but all this is forgivable. It claims to be the
best comedy of the summer, which I don&#x27;t think it quite achieves. There
have been a lot of comedies this summer, and a couple really good ones.
But I enjoyed it a lot!<br /><br />Redbox/Netflix It!<br /><br />For more reviews go to burningreview.blogspot.com
