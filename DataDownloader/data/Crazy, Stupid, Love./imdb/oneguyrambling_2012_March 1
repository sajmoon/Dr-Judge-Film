2012_March 1 
I don&#x27;t deliberately look for rom-coms in movie listings for the same
reason I don&#x27;t try on pairs of high heels before settling on my latest
Nikes; I am not the potential consumer they had in mind when they
manufactured the product. Put another way, I don&#x27;t think ads for Crazy,
Stupid Love were in high rotation on sports channels or in the pages of
FHM.<br /><br />But I have a 5 foot tall bundle of pent-up aggression that I must
periodically pander to&#x85; <br /><br />Cal (Steve Carrell) and Emily (Julianne Moore)are a married couple in
their mid 40s on date night at a plush restaurant. After perusing the
menu for a moment Cal asks his wife of 25 years what she wants, she
replies &#x22;a divorce&#x22;. So the restaurant is not exclusively a la carte
then? (I would also ask why date night seemed a good time to break out
the news. I mean really, enjoy your meals guys.) Cal obviously had no
inkling of the impending bombshell despite Emily previously admitting
to a fling with a work colleague, and he seems to have understandable
trouble in processing the news that his last quarter century has
abruptly ended. Upon moving out he takes to drinking alone in a plush
nightclub, annoying anyone who will listen with all too detailed
specifics of the reasons behind his malaise.<br /><br />Enter Jacob (Ryan Gosling *SWOON*), a younger man who similarly
frequents the same club, but a man cut from decidedly different stock.
Jacob is everything Cal is not, he is bold, smooth and aggressive, the
kind of man women only see in slow motion. The kind of man that seems
to command the attention of all eyes in the room. The kind of man that
can calmly eat dinner at the bar of the nightclub, wipe his mouth and
immediately approach a woman sitting two tables away with the express
intent of picking her up. For reasons unknown to anyone but the
scriptwriter Jacob pities the older lion and he promises to &#x27;reawaken
the man in you&#x27;, cue the lengthy montage where he does just that, and
Cal is systematically reinvented from the New Balance sneakers on up.<br /><br />Now normally that would set the scene in a typical rom-com, with the
ingredients in the bowl it would simply be a case of playing out time
in the unnecessarily complicated dance of inevitability, with whichever
couple is deemed worthy of enjoying the purest form of bliss
smoocherooing for the final few seconds before the credits roll.<br /><br />But Crazy, Stupid Love is a deal more complicated than even that. There
are numerous subplots and peripheral characters dancing here
simultaneously in an out of proceedings. The proliferation of
characters is a strength of the film &#x96; Col&#x27;s son in particular is
hilariously awkward and clumsily blunt &#x96; but it also requires a
suspension of disbelief larger than more out there films such as Source
Code or Limitless. The spoiler-free version acknowledges that a rom-com
demands coincidences and twists, otherwise where is the muted suspense
to come from? But this film calls for far more than mere coincidence,
the karma forces at play here are so very strong that I would suggest
the chances of actual occurrence would be the equivalent of winning the
national lottery three weeks in a row.<br /><br />But ultimately this is neither rom nor com, Crazy, Stupid Love has its
share of romance (I guess) and is generally amusing without moving too
far into either twee or gross-out territory &#x96; a line that seems to be
getting harder to navigate &#x96; and although there are precious few laugh
out loud moments on the plus side I never hated myself for sitting
there, predominantly due to the strength of the leads, Steve Carrell
and Julianne Moore are so likable that it seems a shame that their fake
movie marriage ended, Emma Stone is rapidly making her name as the down
to earth chick that threatens neither male nor female and it would be
hard to resent Kevin Bacon even if it was your wife he was hunting.<br /><br />Which brings me to Ryan Gosling, the current dreamboat for thirty-some
women everywhere, nice and non-threatening enough to introduce him to
the folks yet ripped enough to leave them weak at the knees.<br /><br />I actually like the guy, but I don&#x27;t really understand the allure of a
softly spoken man who constantly slurs his speech like Gosling does,
regardless of how hot the boy is. I&#x27;m pretty sure that the drawl thing
is a turn on when he&#x27;s whispering in your ear, not so much when you&#x27;re
asking &#x96; for the 6th time &#x96; why he hasn&#x27;t managed to take the bins out
even with those great heaving muscles.<br /><br />I guess that&#x27;s the beauty of the rom-com genre, for a couple of hours
the normally unlikable becomes likable, the illogical somehow logical
and the reprehensible strangely &#x27;hensible&#x27;. Crazy, Stupid Love takes
several disparate individuals and has them variously hurting each other
in many ways, yet we as an audience can&#x27;t help for some if not all of
them to get together&#x85; in the traditional male/female marital unit sense
at least.<br /><br />While I still haven&#x27;t seen The Notebook (and hope I never will) I think
Crazy, Stupid Love is a more palatable alternative for guys, and about
as bearable as the rom-com genre can dish up.<br /><br />Final Rating &#x96; 6 / 10. I will never watch this film again, but my first
viewing didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought it would.
