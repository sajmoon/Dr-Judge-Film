The title for this film is a solid choice: CRAZY, STUPID LOVE is.
Thought he reviewers and the general public alike seem to rank this as
one of the greatest films of the decade, for some other viewers this
seems tired and trite and a faux showcase for some excellent actors to
overcome a tawdry story. Writer Dan Fogelman (Cars, Cars 2, Tangled,
Bolt, Fred Claus, etc) may be taking a step up form his previous work
and that is a good sign, but when directors Glenn Ficarra and John
Requa have shown their sensitivity in the much maligned if not sadly
ignored treasure &#x27;I Love You, Philip Morris&#x27; it feels odd they should
go for this script.<br /><br />Difficult to classify as a Romance or Comedy or Drama the film falls
into the familiar category of a RomCom. Opening a film with an
embarrassingly public announcement of a marriage dissolution over a
wife&#x27;s infidelity and dissatisfaction with her nerdy but good
father/provider husband this story embraces about every situation about
falling in and out of &#x27;love&#x27; imaginable. The idea of a monogamous
clueless husband being &#x27;changed&#x27; by a smooth talking, much bedded
lothario isn&#x27;t new nor is the &#x27;finally met his match&#x27; idea fresh. The
manner in which the children of the couple respond with their own needs
and damaged outlooks on relationships works OK, but the manner in which
the in the process of divorcing couple work through their problems
holds a mirror up to today&#x27;s marriages. The stories surround us in
everyday life: the film merely magnifies them.<br /><br />It is always amazing when the marquee boasts the names of some of our
more interesting actors as being involved: Julianne Moore, Ryan
Gosling, Marisa Tomei, Kevin Bacon, et al deliver what they can. The
&#x27;star&#x27; is Steve Carell according to the script, and you have to like
the caricatures he creates to relate to him here. There are some fine
turns in cameos by Emma Stone, young Jonah Bobo, and Liz Lapira; when
they are on screen the film lightens up. But in the end it is a two
hour formulaic condensed television series type story. And yet the
Bravos form the audience must mean there is a craving for this type
movie. <br /><br />Grady Harp
