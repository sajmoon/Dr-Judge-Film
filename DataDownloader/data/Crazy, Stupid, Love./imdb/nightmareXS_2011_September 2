Yesterday, I came here to see the movie&#x27;s review so me and my buddies
(a group of 8 guys)would check this movie tonight. It was rated 7.9 and
most of the reviews were positive and encouraging (The best rom com in
years, something different, a must see, none stop laughing, good for
male audience, bla bla bla).So I was so sure that it&#x27;s going to be a
great movie or at least a good one. <br /><br />And here I am just coming from the theater. GOD it was SOOOOOO BORING
!! Extra silence moments with a lot of boring music topped with a bunch
of cheezy lines. It&#x27;s not a movie for guys, NOT AT ALL! they have to
remove &#x22;Comedy&#x22; cuz it&#x27;s plain drama with different love stories and
few laughter just like any other normal movie.<br /><br />I gotta admit, it has a good story with a kickass twist in the end but
this was the only 5 minutes I enjoyed. Just don&#x27;t believe the
&#x22;Hilarious, Funniest movie of the year&#x22; reviews cuz really it was
boring boring BORING. All what we all wished for is to forward some
scenes cuz we know what is gonna happen or it was just ridiculously
meaningless scenes.<br /><br />PS. I just give it a 3 stars for the sake of fairness. A star for the
twist, a star for mocking twilight and a star for the popcorn in my
hand.
