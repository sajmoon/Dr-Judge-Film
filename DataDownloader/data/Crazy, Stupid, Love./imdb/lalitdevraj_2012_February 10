Funny and intriguing at the same time is what I have to say about this
movie. It&#x27;s interesting to see how dots connect in a different field of
our society, where a younger person teaches a middle aged man how to
discover something he is not familiar with.<br /><br />Definitely a thumbs up for the comedy which although not always &#x22;laugh
out loud&#x22; type comedy, but definitely puts a smug grin on your face.
The screenplay was vivid with no sense of interruption with aspects
diverting away from the point of the story. One is glued really to the
screen as it curiosity is raised as to what happens next.<br /><br />Casting for the roles could not have been better. With Ryan Gosling
playing a more jocund character than normal and Steve Carell being
himself, the combination is ecstatic.<br /><br />This movie cannot be missed for those comedy aficionados and neither
for the fans of these two stars. To put it a better way: This movie
cannot be missed unless your looking for a horror movie concept to lurk
into this movie!
