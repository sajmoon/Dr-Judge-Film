**Spoiler Alert** OK. I get it now. Steve Carell is handsome, talented
and cute. He was at his best in this funny, romantic comedy. Ryan
Gossling was hot, as usual. Emma Stone was adorable, as usual. Julianne
Moore was great, as usual. Annaleigh Tipton was gorgeous. However, it
was strange to see Josh Groban come out of nowhere, and it was sad to
see the beautiful and talented Marisa Tomei, and the talented Kevin
Bacon and John Carroll Lynch relegated to such small, clownish roles.
Overall, a romantic comedy worth watching. Carell needs to keep
churning these out with greater frequency. Roles like this really shine
a spotlight on how he can be tender, funny, witty and touching all at
once. And, dang, his good looks just sort of creep up on you when you
least expect them to.
