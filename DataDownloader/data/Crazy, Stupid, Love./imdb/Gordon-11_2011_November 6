This film is about the love life of a man after his wife asks for a
divorce, as he gets groomed by a lady killer who can get any woman he
wants.<br /><br />&#x22;Crazy, Stupid, Love&#x22; is a lot of fun, with loads of really funny
scenes. Steve Carell acts great as a romantically inept man, his social
skills in a bar is so bad that it just makes you laugh. Ryan Gosling is
so charming and attractive, I think he really carries his character
off. And the teacher is wildly funny too. There are many romantic
entanglements between the characters, and at the end, the whole
situation is so crazy that it is just outrageously funny.<br /><br />&#x22;Crazy, Stupid, Love&#x22; has got this other side as a semi-serious drama
about love and how we treat our loved ones. The film seems to be happy
and mischievous, and yet there are a few very touching scenes. I find
the scene when Julianne Moore calls Steve Carell about the heater very
touching. The scene where Steve Carell makes a speech at the end is
even more touching. &#x22;Crazy, Stupid, Love&#x22; is a rare romantic comedy
with substance and heart. I really like it.
