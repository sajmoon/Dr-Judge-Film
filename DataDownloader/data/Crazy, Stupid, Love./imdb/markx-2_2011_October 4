About 3/4 of the way through there&#x27;s a scene which lasts about 2
minutes that&#x27;s actually funny and I think the audience laughed for the
first time.<br /><br />The film up to that point plods it&#x27;s way here, with a creepy sad plot
and long, long silences to make this moment.<br /><br />The last 1/4 of the film is totally and utterly pointless and simply
attempts to resolve the story in a totally embarrassing and
non-humorous way.<br /><br />Honestly the people who wrote this film have no clue about what love is
- it certainly isn&#x27;t endlessly pursuing and stalking someone who says
no repeatedly.
