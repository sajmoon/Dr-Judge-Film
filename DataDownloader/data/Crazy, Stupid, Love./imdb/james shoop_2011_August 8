So, what do I know? This movie started off very serious with Steve
Carell jumping out of a car because his wife just made love to another
man. Depressing start that turned into a romantic movie. Delightfully
so, it also turned into a &#x22;screwball comedy&#x22; with the introduction of
the Marisa Tomei character and I mean character. Carol Lombard I hope
you are watching! In the end it all turns out to be a very good
romantic comedy. Oh, yes! The backyard scene was superb, all of the
actors and I mean all just pulled it off. Go see it! A very good movie.
By the way, even though the cast is star laden it is Steve Carell&#x27;s
movie. And it was not his &#x22;Office&#x22; character, but a blend of Cary
Grant, James Stewart, a little John Travolta and William Powell. Yes,
the screwball comedy elite actors.
