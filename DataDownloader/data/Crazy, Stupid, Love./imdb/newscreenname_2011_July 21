There isn&#x27;t anything particularly groundbreaking or &#x22;Oscar worthy&#x22; in
&#x27;Crazy, Stupid, Love&#x27;, but what there is is a good deal of heart, some
genuine laughs, and a great chemistry-laden cast working together on a
very high level.<br /><br />Fair warning though, this movie doesn&#x27;t fit in with the current comedy
trends all that well -- that is, if you&#x27;re all about &#x27;Hangover
II&#x27;-esque humor, this is not the film for you. While it doesn&#x27;t quite
get to the same level, it&#x27;s very much in the same vein as &#x27;Love
Actually&#x27;.<br /><br />I wish we could give half points, because this was definite 8.5/10.
