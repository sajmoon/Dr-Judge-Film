This is an exceptionally enjoyable movie for what could typically be
expected out of it. First, I am not a fan of Steve Carell, but he does
very well. Also, Ryan Gosling is very appropriate for his part.
However, I rated the movie 8, not because of the actors or the somewhat
enjoyable plot, but because there where some moments that were really
GOOD. And not &#x27;romantic comedy&#x27; good, but truly &#x27;fresh&#x27;, funny, and
well played. Of course, it didn&#x27;t manage to avoid all the banalities
which we in one or another way see in most romantic comedies, however,
it did stand out with those small moments that really made me smile.
&#x22;Crazy.Stupid.Love&#x22; is a bit naive, for sure, but it is also inspiring
and at some parts truly touching.
