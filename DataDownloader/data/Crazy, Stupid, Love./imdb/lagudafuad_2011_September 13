We are familiar in seeing Steve Carell in all round crazy comedies
like, Get Smart, Date Night and others. This movie drops in a different
category all together as we see him play a comic role but had to put
some serious dramatic energy in it, to make the character not look
phony. If you are not a huge fan of the whole, romantic comedy flicks,
this movie is a set aside for all. Starting all clich&#xE9;-ish, Steve
Carell plays Cal Weaver a Mr. Nice guy who&#x27;s wife cheated on him and to
add insult to injury, she tells him this to his face on their way home
from dinner which ended abruptly when she dropped the divorce bomb. Cal
all bumped out starts to hang in a bar gets drunk and talks on and on
about his wife (Julianne Moore) cheating on him. He meets Jacob (Ryan
Gosling) who takes him under his wing and turns him to a lady magnet.
From here the movie goes through the same tunnel as others, the hunk
mentor falls in love and prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; ends up not wanting to quit the game,
the movie then adds twists and turns with an enlighten ending. The
scripts from Dan Fogelman and direction from &#x22;Bad Santa&#x22; writers Glenn
Ficarra and John Requa, we are presented with a perfect ensemble cast,
which delivers in both comedy and drama to keep you watching to the
very end.<br /><br />The only problem with the movie is just the fact that it is
predictable, as we have been dealt in various dosages of romantic
movies going in this trend, but known has a 13 year old boy who was
insanely in love with a 17 year old, I will give the writers that. Also
to add the 17 year old was in love with Cal.<br /><br />Marisa Tomei, joins the cast as the first girl Cal, lands in the sack.<br /><br />The thing about reviewing a romantic comedy is trying not to reveal all
the plot and at the end , killing the fun, so you want to go to the
cinemas with your girl? Go watch Crazy, Stupid, Love
