This movie is your basic funny movie about a cheating spouse. This
movie draws you in quick with the basic routine lifestyle of a family
that gets bored and looks for a spark, even if its from a fling of
cheating. This movie hits the nail on the head numerous times, but
falls short with a few boring scenes, and some of the script writing.
The actors seem to do the best they can with what they have to work
with or with the characters they are representing. I didn&#x27;t agree with
some of the actor/actress playing some of the characters. Some just
didn&#x27;t seem to fit the role of the characters. But still OK. This could
be one of the top 5 funny movies, IF the edges were sharpened some...
