This is yet another romcom drama movie. It did not appeal to me much
although the movie has many positive aspects. The movie is based on the
theme that there is one true love (soul mate) for everyone and once you
find it you never quit on them. You keep on trying no matter whether
you are unreasonably out of the way.<br /><br />You got nothing to take away from the movie except the message that
find your soul mate and stick with them. The slow motion shots just
make the movie more cheap. I have seen a lot of Bollywood movies and I
wonder whether they got inspired from Bollywood.<br /><br />On the positive side, you have excellent music score and amazing acting
with big names associated with it. Also, what surpasses this movie than
others in its own genre is that it has got an element of surprise every
now and then to keep you interested. The movie just passes by smoothly
without anything to think about.
