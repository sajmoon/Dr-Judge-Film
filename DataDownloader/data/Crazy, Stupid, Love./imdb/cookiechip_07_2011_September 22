Crazy Stupid Love<br /><br />Yes it&#x27;s a rom- com, and I can hear the sound of guys being dragged to
go see yet another one just to please their partners. Well guys, you&#x27;re
in for a shock and a good one too! As finally after a long time,
Hollywood provides a romantic comedy that is actually funny, smart,
charming and one that men will actually enjoy rather than just
pretending! <br /><br />The plot is as follows; mid-fortys, straight-laced Cal Weaver (Steve
Carell) is living a dream-good job, nice house, great kids and marriage
to his high school sweetheart. But when Cal blinded by love learns that
his wife, Emily (Julianne Moore), has cheated on him and wants a
divorce, his happy life quickly unravels. Worse, in today&#x27;s single
world, Cal, who hasn&#x27;t dated in decades, stands out as the epitome of
un-smooth. Now spending his free evenings sulking alone at a local bar,
the hapless Cal is taken on as wingman and prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; to handsome,
thirtysomething player Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling).<br /><br />The humour is family suited; running gags with no toilet humour in
sight. Its refreshing that its predominately dialogue that is funny and
peoples reactions rather than slapstick falling over etc.<br /><br />A stand out feature is undoubtedly the cast as each actor provides
laughs in their own characterised way. Even the additional cast never
falter as Liza Lapira aka Liz is the no nonsense quick witted bff of
Emma Stone and not forgetting scene stealer Marisa Tomei adding the
&#x27;crazy&#x27; to the title whilst Emma Stone- who may not be utilised a much
as she is cable of &#x96; is still beautiful and solid as ever. Young guns
Analeigh Tipton and Jonah Bobo also provide positive acting abilities
but it&#x27;s the two leads the movie hangs on. Steve Carrell brings his
perfected dry wit to the proceedings but also a range of emotions which
we don&#x27;t normally get to see from him. Playing the socially awkward
character is second nature to him now and he does it so well that
throughout crazy stupid love you may miss the glimpses of his ability
to be serious when we see him in this adult &#x27;dad&#x27; role. There are
strong indications there that he can gain stronger roles in different
genres if given the chance. <br /><br />Ryan Gosling is the &#x27;player&#x27;, who takes it upon him self to transform
the luck of Cal, inject some mojo and bring back his &#x22;lost manhood&#x22;. To
describe his character it would be that girls want him and guys want to
be him. The personality he shows us is on a perfect line of confidence
without the arrogance and makes his uber cool persona seem achievable
to the everyday man. <br /><br />Another element for the audience is the films nicely balanced
soundtrack, one for those interested in finding some unheard of bands,
jazzy pieces and songs of soft delight. The screen play is clever in
that it shows the picture as if to be admired from afar and not to be
subjected up-close. The individual stories are to be taken on the
surface, lightly and not questioned because its not a deep movie, the
strength lies in the believing in good hearted people overcoming life&#x27;s
obstacles. <br /><br />In summary, Crazy, Stupid Love is all about the love, laughs and life.
While it may not be magical, it&#x27;s fully worthwhile and produces a
golden &#x27;OMG&#x27; moment! The length is near the two hour mark which
admittedly the pace / tone dips in the middle but it does pick up again
and leaves the audience with hope that even though love make us crazy
and stupid, we wouldn&#x27;t want it any other way! <br /><br />(my ratings are based on 6 average 7 good 8 very good 9 superb 10 epic)
