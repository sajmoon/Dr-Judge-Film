This film is recommended.<br /><br />Crazy, Stupid, Love. is not really crazy or, thank God, stupid, but it
does speak eloquently of love and relationships with a honesty sorely
lacking in most rom-coms these days. The film is a refreshingly honest
glimpse of love and all its complications with a large amount of humor
and pathos to spare.<br /><br />After 20 plus years, Emily wants a divorce from Cal, a happily married
family man, although he&#x27;d rather have the Creme Brulee on the menu than
hear the news. Set adrift, Cal is forced to enter the world of dating
and is mentored by Jacob, a six-packed sexy ladies man who is slicker
than slick. Meanwhile, Jacob goes from woman to woman until he meets
Hannah, a no-nonsense savvy young lady. Both men are suddenly in free
fall, quickly in need of re- evaluating their vastly different lives.<br /><br />Solidly directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, Crazy, Stupid, Love.
( Yes, that is the correct punctuation for the title. ) is a rarity in
romantic comedies. It is romantic and it is a comedy with genuine
laughs that do not sacrifice characterization or plot structure. It
does not pander to cheap laughs or raunchy sophomoric humor. It is a
mature look at mature people acting immaturely. ( Even teenagers, like
Cal&#x27;s son, Robbie ( Jonah Bobo ), who has a crush on his babysitter,
Jessica ( Analeigh Tipton ), who has a crush on Cal, are handled with
respect and poignancy. By the way, both young actors excel in their
roles. )<br /><br />The film has a biting sense of irony with its clever and witty dialog
throughout most of the film until it veers into sitcom territory with
some of the absurd circumstances foisted on the characters. Yes, there
are also some nifty unexpected twists towards the end, leading to a
totally improbable situation of farcical proportions, that, while
played for laughs, is a tad illogical. Also, some of these characters&#x27;
excessive reactions become a bit cartoony with silly responses that
undercut the deeper and more heartfelt moments that the film
successfully captures due to the well written script by Dan Fogelman
and the fine acting from the gifted ensemble.<br /><br />High praise goes to Steve Carell and Julianne Moore as the divorcing
parents, and Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as the young lovers. Carell
displays a piercing vulnerability that commands the screen and I was
even more impressed by his dramatic acting skills than his usual
everyman droll persona. Moore is his perfect counterpart, a woman
conflicted by age and complacency, caught in a marital middle ground of
uncertainty. Gosling takes an unlikeable Lothario role and layers it
with fresh humor and impeccable comic timing. Stone adds an easy charm
and poise to her cynical professional character. The roles of Cal&#x27;s and
Emily&#x27;s rebound lovers, played by Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon, though
well acted, seem to be from another film and are played for much
broader laughs, one of the few missteps in this fine comedy.<br /><br />&#xFFFC;Crazy, Stupid, Love. is a humorous and insightful film that sees our
crazy stupid human flaws and celebrates them with laughter, love, and
much wisdom. GRADE: B<br /><br />NOTE: Visit my movie blog for more reviews: www.dearmoviegoer.com
