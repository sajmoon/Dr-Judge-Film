2011_October 29 
Let me start by saying I feel like I&#x27;ve watched every single move there
is known to existence. I was looking for something new to watch, and
couldn&#x27;t find anything...So I went with crazy stupid love. This is
something I wouldn&#x27;t normally watch but it had gotten good reviews so I
decided to check it out. In short, I really liked it. Ryan Gosling does
an exceptional job with playing this smooth talking ladies man. While
Steve Carrel plays the complete opposite. A guy that is down on his
luck, and just trying to get back on the horse. The way the film
intertwines all the characters, is fun and entertaining. There isn&#x27;t
really any characters I didn&#x27;t like, and by the end of the film when
the credits rolled up I had a smile on my face. I guess that was the
point of the movie, so two thumbs up from me!
