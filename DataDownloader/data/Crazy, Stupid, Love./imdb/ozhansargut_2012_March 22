Bravo Jessica(Analeigh Tipton).Take the cat off the wall.That picture
shouldn&#x27;t be at the background from the first moment.The message is
hidden in that scene.Actually I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a message.It&#x27;s something
deeper.Maybe some of the viewers couldn&#x27;t understand the meaning of
this scene.Why did she take the kitten picture of the wall? I can&#x27;t
explain it here. Just investigate the reason.I interpret that scene in
my way and I hope you do the same.Probably my comment will be removed.
So lets say something about the whole movie. I think the movie is worth
watching.Steve Carell and Julianne Moore did her best.They showed us
how the parents should and shouldn&#x27;t be. Fight for your love.Go for
it.Don&#x27;t be afraid to say I love you. Age is not a matter.There was
love without limits.
