Some Hollywood writer who&#x27;s been burned at love decides, &#x22;Hey, if I
have to be miserable, I&#x27;m gonna make everyone around me miserable too.&#x22;
Thus is born Crazy, Stupid, Love.<br /><br />But to sucker the public into the theaters they have to market it as a
rom-com, so the stars do the publicity tours and call it a wonderful,
funny movie. Then you go see it hoping to get what&#x27;s been advertised,
but it soon takes a turn away from the nice, funny story it starts as
and harps endlessly about infidelity, child porn, the futility of
trying to get back together and the hopelessness of life.<br /><br />Against all this negativity and depravity they throw in some really ham
handed slapstick (the actors must have been embarrassed while they shot
some of these scenes) and a cute kid, the boy who plays Robbie and
steals the show, and some surprise twists. A twist is OK, it spices up
a movie, but you know they&#x27;re desperate when they put in another
surprise twist, and then another one, and then another one.<br /><br />And then they end it all with a lecture delivered by the leading man,
whose embarrassment at delivering the lines seems to go beyond acting
to reality.<br /><br />I tried to give this movie a 3 rating because of the humor, which is
good in places, but I just couldn&#x27;t. On the IMDb scale of 10 it gets a
2.<br /><br />There are Tragedies and there are Comedies, and if you are one of those
people who likes Tragedy I guess you&#x27;ll probably think this movie is
OK. It&#x27;s pretty much the opposite of a romantic comedy.
