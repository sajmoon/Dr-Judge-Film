...Okay, almost never. But as soon as Crazy, Stupid, Love was over, I
wanted to see it again. I agree with the first reviewer that this is
one of the best romantic comedies of the decade.<br /><br />I couldn&#x27;t have been more surprised at my reaction. After all, it&#x27;s a
Steve Carell movie. I like him well enough, but his movies have usually
left me mildly amused. In this film, he shows a depth of emotion that
he had only hinted at before.<br /><br />But the character who got to me the most was Ryan Gosling. His
performance was amazing. Everyone did an excellent job, but his
character showed a range that I didn&#x27;t expect.<br /><br />This movie was sometimes a little crazy, but definitely not stupid. And
its heart was pure love.
