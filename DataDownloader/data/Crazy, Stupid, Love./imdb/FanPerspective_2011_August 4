I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this film! The story is so grounded in
reality. The writing is so perfectly heartfelt and hilarious. The cast
is incredible! It&#x27;s just a wonderful movie and kind of a nice break
from all the big action films that have been dominating the summer.
True, it is a romantic comedy, but I think it is one that the guys will
enjoy just as much as the girls.<br /><br />It may fit in the typical romance movie clich&#xE9; every now and then, but
overall the story is much more realistic. It skips the lovey dovey
elements of a normal chick flick and introduces you to a married
couple, Cal and Emily (played by Steve Carell and Julianne Moore), who
seemingly have a normal life.. a stable living, kids, they were high
school sweethearts. We meet them, though, at a not so great time in
their lives because she wants a divorce. Now, Cal must navigate in the
role of a single man with some assistance from a &#x22;professional
bachelor&#x22; (Ryan Gosling).<br /><br />Even the most serious of moments in this film are dashed with a flavor
of quirky comedic relief.. the kind that life so graciously grants us
so that we don&#x27;t totally fall apart in a horrible situation. I also
liked the fact that this film not only explored the topic of love many
years after the couple had fallen for one another, but it also took a
look at young love, as well; that first time a guy falls for a girl
because it is like he is seeing women for the first time. Or the first
time a younger person develops an interest for someone much older than
they are. Everyone can relate to this film.<br /><br />The casting truly was perfect. There a lot of times when a film
features so many big names that it just tries to sell them and loses
track of the story; the heart of the film. Playing alongside Carell,
Moore and Gosling were the talents of Kevin Bacon, Marisa Tomei, Emma
Stone, Josh Groban and relative newcomer Jonah Bobo. Each brought these
characters to life in such a way that you forgot they were big name
actors and just got yourself immersed in the story the characters were
apart of.<br /><br />It&#x27;s definitely a film that you won&#x27;t want to miss! Truthfully, I fell
in love with it! When it comes to romantic comedies, I don&#x27;t often find
ones that I really like, but this is just a fantastic film!
