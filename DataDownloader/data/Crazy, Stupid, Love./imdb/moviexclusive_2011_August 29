Sigh, things would have been so, so different if this reviewer had met
someone like Jacob Palmer the last time he visited a bar. You see,
Jacob is a dude who manages to charm women with the slightest effort,
so much so that the somehow manages to bed different women on different
nights. Not that this reviewer wants to be a promiscuous creep, but
things would be so, so different if Jacob had taught him how to pick up
women, like how he dished advice to Cal. <br /><br />Ah, Cal. Cal is a middle aged man who just learnt that his wife had
slept with her colleague. She asks him for a divorce and his world
comes crashing down. His once perfect life becomes a mess until he
meets Jacob in a bar. Taking pity on the down and out Cal, the Casanova
agrees to teach him how to pick up women. Somewhere in this is a pretty
law student, a horny teacher, a lovelorn boy and a, well, without
giving too much away, creative babysitter.<br /><br />As the title suggests, this movie directed by Glenn Ficarra and John
Requa (screenwriters who went on to direct their self penned I Love You
Phillip Morris in 2009) has the intention of showing its audience how
crazy and stupid love can get. Or at least, how crazy and stupid people
can get in the name of love.<br /><br />Looking at the movie&#x27;s leading man, one would expect a gross out comedy
with toilet gags and fart jokes (sorry, Steve Carell, but your
character in The 40 Year Old Virgin will never be etched out of our
minds), but the comedy drama turns out to be a pleasantly sweet take on
love which will have you smiling at the end.<br /><br />Carell plays the middle aged man who is faced with the biggest crisis
ever &#x96; life. He manages to give a nuanced and affecting performance,
nicely complementing his on screen wife Julianne Moore&#x27;s (The Kids Are
Alright) ever perfect portrayal of a career woman. Then there is Ryan
Gosling (All Good Things), who takes on the role of the playboy. Watch
out for his amazing six pack abs (how long did the dude train to get a
hot bod like that?) and an amusing, err, bed scene with his co star
Emma Stone (Easy A) which is one of the charmingly lovable romantic
sequences we&#x27;ve seen. The wonderful cast also includes Marisa Tomei
(The Wrestler), Kevin Bacon (X Men: First Class) and a certain crooner
we know as Josh Groban.<br /><br />Written by Dan Folgelman (Tangled), this 118 minute movie may feel a
little stretched at times, but thanks to its agreeable cast and a down
to earth story, its viewers will gladly sit through the romantic comedy
without complaining. The characters&#x27; interactions with each other (they
all come together in the movie&#x27;s finale) are extremely likable, despite
the filmmakers&#x27; deliberate attempt to string them together.<br /><br />- www.moviexclusive.com<br /><br />When the end credits roll, one can feel the exuberance of love and walk
out of the theaters hopeful and buoyant. The fairly smart movie is one
of the better Hollywood romantic comedies we have seen and is
definitely a good choice for a movie night date.<br /><br />- www.moviexclusive.com
