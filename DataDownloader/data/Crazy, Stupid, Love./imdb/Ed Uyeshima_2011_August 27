I tend to underestimate Steve Carell on the big screen probably because
of titles like &#x22;Dinner with Schmucks&#x22;, &#x22;Evan Almighty&#x22;, and of course,
&#x22;The 40 Year-Old Virgin&#x22;, but when given the opportunity as he did in
2007&#x27;s &#x22;Dan in Real Life&#x22; and as he does in this grown-up 2011 comedy,
he can provide unexpected dimension to an otherwise put-upon, sad-sack
character. Co-directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa and written by
Dan Fogelman, this movie is overlong at 118 minutes and has
contrivances galore, but it&#x27;s also smart, shrewdly observed, and richly
character-driven. These qualities override the flaws primarily due to a
well-assembled cast that also includes Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore,
Emma Stone and Marisa Tomei. Fogelman&#x27;s screenplay punctuates big life
lessons with clever scenes and ensemble set pieces that really snap and
play like a Shakespearean roundelay.<br /><br />The plot centers on nebbish suburbanite Cal Weaver, who after two
decades of seemingly content marriage, finds out his wife Emily has
been unfaithful with her co-worker and wants a divorce. As the reality
of his situation settles in, he moves from comatose to resentful to
relentlessly morose at which point he has a chance meeting in a trendy
bar with a self-confident womanizer named Jacob Palmer. Through reasons
that go unexplained, Jacob decides to make Cal his pet project and make
him over into a smooth-talking dating machine in an amusing montage
that climaxes with a date with Kate, a jittery middle schoolteacher who
turns out to be something of a nymphomaniac. Emily stumbles in her
newly liberated state, while her and Cal&#x27;s 13-year-old son Robbie
grapples with a long-standing crush on his high-school-age babysitter
Jessica who is smitten with someone substantially older. Meanwhile,
Jacob goes through a transformation of his own as he falls for a
sassy-smart young lawyer named Hannah who initially doesn&#x27;t succumb to
his fool-proof pick-up lines. All the characters intersect rather
conveniently, and needless to say, complications ensue.<br /><br />Ficarra and Requa have a nice way of shaping Fogelman&#x27;s dialogue into
the pacing of the scenes, but they spend far too long in the middle of
the story making the loose ends look more pronounced toward the end.
Dexterous performances which effortlessly balance the comic and humane
elements are essential to making the shenanigans work, and they&#x27;re here
in spades. Carell mines his character Cal in unexpected ways but
doesn&#x27;t lose his keen sense of comedy. As Jacob, Gosling is a nice
surprise as he breezes through a role that could have been far more
repellent had love not befuddled him so completely. Stone, currently
Hollywood&#x27;s &#x22;It&#x22; girl, nicely complements him as the acerbic Hannah,
and their extended sequence at his elegant home is really well played
by both actors. As Emily, Moore is the rare actress who can play a
character who commits an unforgivable act and still can elicit viewer
sympathy. Jonah Bobo plays Robbie with deadpan precociousness, while
the too-thin Analeigh Tipton fluently brings out all the awkward
gawkiness in Jessica. Tomei&#x27;s turn as Kate is brief albeit a memorable
one highlighted by a very funny classroom scene, while Kevin Bacon
plays Emily&#x27;s co-worker with his character&#x27;s smarminess in check. This
is one of the better comedies released this year.
