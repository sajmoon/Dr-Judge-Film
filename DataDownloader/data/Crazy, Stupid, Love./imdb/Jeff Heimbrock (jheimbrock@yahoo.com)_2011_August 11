Like a breath of fresh air, Glenn Ficarra and John Requa&#x27;s CRAZY,
STUPID, LOVE rises above the heap of lifeless, senseless romantic
comedies, and presents us with something more. What the directors
mainly focus on is&#x85;wait for it: love. But not just love, but adolescent
infatuation love, teenage infatuation love, guilty love, regretful
love, real love, fake love, all of these different types of
relationships and feelings, that are not simply displayed, as in most
other entries into this genre, but truly felt, and that&#x27;s where the
movie gains a heart that not only makes it fairly believable, but makes
it alive and more than shallow. Above all, it focuses on two very
specific thoughts on love: the one of the one true love (cliche at
best) and then the sexual love. And the strength of the film is when
the characters (who do in fact have feelings that are adequately
portrayed) gain clarity on the difference. It&#x27;s not the most sensitive
or poetic way that the message has been portrayed in the past, but the
movie never tries to be an art film, just a smart, character driven
comedy. We get a series of different situations, which at first seemed
too fragmented to make an impact. On that matter, I still believe the
film suffers from not letting us spend enough time with, say, Emma
Stone&#x27;s relationship with Ryan Gosling, and though I don&#x27;t believe it
tries to cram in too many plot points, I do think that the balance is
slightly off. Not enough, of course, to jeopardize any enjoyment of
what&#x27;s going on. All of these fragments pay off in the third act of the
movie, when they come together in a way that might have seemed
predictable, but actually made for some great character moments and
hilarious scenes. It is this fact that the directors and screenwriter
Dan Fogelman can take the clich&#xE9;s of the genre and use them to advance
the emotional storytelling that&#x27;s taking place. This doesn&#x27;t work all
the time: an almost cringe worthy moment happens towards the end of the
film that strays into an area far beneath its smart writing and
wonderful performances. Speaking of the cast, they were incredibly
assembled and are what makes this film what it is. Steve Carrell&#x27;s best
performance, slick work from Ryan Gosling, another example of Emma
Stone&#x27;s throning as Queen Bee of Hollywood, and, most importantly, the
always sublime Julianne Moore, who starts off this comedy with
heartbreaking sequences featuring Carrell that make this more than just
a feature for laughs. The best romantic comedy since 2009&#x27;s 500 DAYS OF
SUMMER, this film presents the very nature of it&#x27;s main subject. Love
IS crazy, love IS stupid, and we love it. A-
