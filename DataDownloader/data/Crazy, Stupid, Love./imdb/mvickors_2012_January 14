I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I went to see this film, but I&#x27;ve now
watched it three times! The way that it follows a lot of different
story lines makes it interesting, and all of the actors made their
characters believable. I especially like the character of 13 year old
Robbie ( Jonah Bobo) - I think that he plays to his character very
well- and it is a very real portrayal of a teenage boy. Steve carell
shows that he can play serious roles, and Ryan Gosling is the perfect
choice for the character of player- Jacob palmer. There are a lot of
funny moments, and some more serious but heartwarming scenes. With some
cute speeches and a theme of &#x27;fighting for your soul-mate&#x27;, this film
is a great hit with teens and adults alike, and went down well with my
whole family. The characters are relatable to, and it&#x27;s nice to hear
their individual stories. I would definitely recommend this movie!
