I appear to be alone in this thought, but I thought this was awful,
just dreadful. Bad script, bad acting, bad close-ups, but most of all
-- bad directing.<br /><br />Staring off with the most annoying actress to ever by on screen --
ANALEIGH Tipton. Oh, please you can barely look at her she is so awful.
Every shot of her and everyone else is so tight it makes you
uncomfortable. There is so much wrong with this film I really don&#x27;t
know where to start, so I&#x27;ll just say: the big &#x22;twist&#x22; is just plain
stupid -- who cares? It doesn&#x27;t add anything to the story. The child
porn thing is just creepy. The main story element of the failing
marriage is never really fleshed out. The other main story point -- of
Steve Carrell&#x27;s character becoming a horn dog -- is odd and
off-putting. The whole movie is just plain weird. That&#x27;s as best as I
can sum it up. The casting is especially odd. Marissa Tomei and Kevin
bacon are thrown in for -- oh, I don&#x27;t know. The 13-year old son is
bad. The little girl has no lines at all. Julianna Moore is just not
good here -- comes off as a harpy. The only saving grace is -- Emma
Stone. She is kind of radiant, if that makes any sense. But the story
line she has really doesn&#x27;t make sense, because Ryan Gosling also plays
a horn dog with no sense of goodness, who only goes after really hot
chicks so, no -- he would NOT seek her out from a crowded bar.<br /><br />Not worth your money. Skip this one.
