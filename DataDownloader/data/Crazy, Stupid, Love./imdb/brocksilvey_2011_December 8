&#x22;Crazy Stupid Love&#x22; is about 20 minutes of a terrific little romantic
comedy starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone surrounded by another 100
minutes of borderline dreadful romantic comedy starring everybody else.
Gosling and Stone just ooze charm and screen presence, and their
chemistry together is so natural and infectious that I simply could not
tolerate any part of the movie that shifted away from them to deal with
Steve Carrell and Julianne Moore, two actors I usually like but who are
stuck in a clich&#xE9;, middle-aged-couple-in-midlife-crisis storyline. Add
this film to the alarmingly growing list of Hollywood films in which
adults have forgotten how to be adults and only remember how to be from
watching and listening to their kids.<br /><br />&#x22;Crazy Stupid Love&#x22; is tolerable up to a point, but by the end it&#x27;s
simply too long and too stupid to leave any impression other than that
it was a big fat dud.<br /><br />Grade: C
