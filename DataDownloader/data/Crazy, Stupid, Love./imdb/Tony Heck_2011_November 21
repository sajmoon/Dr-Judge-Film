&#x22;I&#x27;m going to help you rediscover your manhood. Do you have any idea
where you could have lost it?&#x22; Cal (Carell) and his wife Emily (Moore)
are out on a date when she asks for a divorce. Devastated Cal turns to
a bar where he meets Jacob (Gosling) a young ladies man who tries to
help Cal through the tough times. When Cal learns to be like Jacob he
still feels like his life is missing something. Every once in a while a
&#x22;chick flick&#x22; comes along that I really enjoy as much as my girlfriend.
This is one of them. The cast alone is enough reason to watch it, but
this is a comedy with a lot of heart and I think would be good no
matter who was in it. Carell and Moore do a great job and Gosling is
very funny to watch. This is a movie that is pretty predictable from
the beginning, but is still a very enjoyable movie to watch and keeps
you interested the entire time. I highly recommend this one. Overall, a
great movie that men, not just women will enjoy. I give it an A-.<br /><br />*Also try - Dan In Real Life &#x26; In Good Company
