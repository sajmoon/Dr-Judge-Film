A surprising movie on many levels. Sassy humor mixed with grounding
reality. The story seems to sprawl a little, in the way it goes all
over the place at times, and yet it manages to create a fun gem of an
evening. I haven&#x27;t laughed so hard in a theater in a long time--and it
wasn&#x27;t over the crude humor that so often gets the crowds going (which
I don&#x27;t care for). Yes, there is crude humor--it seems to come with the
territory in Steve Carell movies--but that is not the basis for what
makes this movie great. Nor is it &#x22;great&#x22; in the sense that I expect it
to land a bunch of award nominations. But if you&#x27;re looking for a movie
that mimics life, but presents it in an entertaining way, you&#x27;ll
probably enjoy this one. The actors portray their characters well, the
plot twists keep it interesting, and it is really a deeper story than
the surface value suggests.
