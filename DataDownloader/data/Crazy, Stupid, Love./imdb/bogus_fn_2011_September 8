Everything works in this movie, mostly due to wonderful acting and
great chemistry between the actors. This movie is simply hilarious,
unexpected at times and a joy to watch. I saw it expecting the typical
clich&#xE9; kitsch, hopefully with a couple of giggles, and ended up
laughing through most of it while also being moved by the sincere
feelings each character conveys. <br /><br />The entire cast is absolutely wonderful. I was not surprised at all to
hear Ryan Gosling say in an interview that he would love to do a sequel
with the same cast and directors. <br /><br />Highly recommended for a light and fun evening with friends and/or
date. Go see! :-)
