There had been a lot of good words about this comedy called &#x22;Crazy
Stupid Love.&#x22; Although I am not really a guy who would go and watch a
romantic comedy, I watched this one for Steve Carrell, whom I believe
is one of the funniest guys in Hollywood now. <br /><br />This movie starts with Emily (Julianne Moore) telling her husband of 25
years Cal (Steve Carrell) that she wants a divorce while they were
dining in a restaurant. OK, so now I know that I have a black comedy
ahead of me. The movie follows Cal who was &#x22;helped&#x22; by playboy Jacob
(Ryan Gosling) to get him ready to meet other women. One of the women
he hooks up with is Kate (the hilarious Marisa Tomei). Emily on the
other hand, takes up with David (the ever smarmy Kevin Bacon). <br /><br />Side stories include Jacob hooking up with young lawyer Hannah (Emma
Stone), who in turn was hoping her colleague (Josh Groban) would
propose to her. Meanwhile, Cal and Emily&#x27;s 13-year old son Robbie is
sure that his 17-year old babysitter Jessica (America&#x27;s Next Top Model
finalist Analeigh Tipton) is his soul mate. But she is in love with a
much older married man. Such is the complicated web that this movie
weaves.<br /><br />Steve Carrell again does very well with this sad-sack character that he
seems to know so well. His deadpan delivery in some pretty funny
situations that Cal gets himself into was spot on. The character of
Ryan Gosling though, I find preposterous. I agree with Cal&#x27;s belated
realization that this guy is one big creep. The women basically play
straight men to the male characters, with Marisa Tomei shining in the
laughs department despite her short role.<br /><br />While I liked the surprises in the climax and the touching scene at
Robbie&#x27;s graduation, the rest of the film did not really appeal to me
too much. Yes, there were funny parts but a lot fall flat for me. I
must say that for conservatives, there can be a lot of uncomfortable
situations that may be hard to watch in this film. I know women may
disagree with me about Ryan Gosling&#x27;s part though.
