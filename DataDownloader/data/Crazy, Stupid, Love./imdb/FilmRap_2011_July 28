Dan Fogelman, who wrote Cars and other successful animated movies wrote
this well thought out comedy about all too human relationships. He
wrote it having Steve Carell in mind as Cal , the middle age guy around
whom all the actions swirls as his marriage suddenly falls apart.
Carell loves the project and decides to produce it with Warner Brothers
coming on board to make it a big studio film. The team of Glen Ficarra
and John Requa are brought in to direct it. They have been working
together since their college days at Pratt in New York City. They have
written Bad Santa and Bad News Bears as well as recently directing I
Love You Phillip Morris with Jim Carrey. After meeting these three
talented people at our screening we can see how their chemistry worked
for this character driven comedy with a wonderful cast. Ryan Gosling
played Jacob, the cool single but obviously complex guy who takes the
recently jilted Cal under his wing. Julianne Moore is Emily, Cal&#x27;s wife
who is going through what she describes as a mid-life crisis. Emma
Stone, Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon round out this all star cast with
each putting just the right touch on their characters. Special mention
should be made about young Jonah Bobo who plays Robbie, the 13 year old
son of Cal and Emily whose emotional experience helps all the
characters and the audience understand the essence of the movie. The
result is not only a funny comedy but a touching story which examines
love that can start as teenagers and sometimes be destined to last a
life time with trials and tribulations. It also looks at teenage &#x22;love&#x22;
that may only just feel like love. The story line is close to being
brilliant as the characters evolving relationships are charming,
touching, surprising and fun to watch as well as being easy to identify
with. FilmRap.net
