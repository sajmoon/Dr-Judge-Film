I have nothing personal against Rom-coms, it&#x27;s just that sometimes a
film really surprises you in a good way or it falls flat on its face.
Crazy, Stupid, Love fortunately belongs in the former category. If
there was anything that lets Crazy, Stupid, Love down, it was that the
film stumbles a little in the final act.<br /><br />Everything else however works, and the result is a surprising and
hugely enjoyable Rom-com. The filming is never cheap and often stylish
and pretty and the scenery is very striking. The soundtrack also
compliments the film very well, as does the direction. The story is
very clever too with seldom a dull part, only the final act has signs
of inconsistency.<br /><br />For me, what lifts a Rom-com especially is the cast, the chemistry and
the quality of the script. Luckily, Crazy, Stupid, Love succeeds in all
three of those areas. The script is funny in a witty, droll and
infectious sense, with plenty of moments to warm your heart and touch
you too. The chemistry of the actors is also there and very believably
done.<br /><br />Steve Carrell is brilliant here, while I do consider him talented with
good material, I don&#x27;t think he has been this good in a while. Ryan
Gosling exudes charisma in his role, Julianne Moore and Emma Stone are
very charming and Marisa Tomei while perhaps over-the-top is memorable.<br /><br />In conclusion, very surprising and really well done. 9/10 Bethany Cox
