Crazy, Stupid, Love. is this season&#x27;s equivalent of He&#x27;s Just Not That
Into You, Valentine&#x27;s Day and other recent romantic dramas and comedies
that sprawl in their dealing with that titular emotion that can drive
you wild when things are going your way, or mad when things aren&#x27;t, and
especially the latter which is what this film had its multiple
narratives dwelling on. The ensemble cast makes it a bonus to sit
through with its star power on display, with a good mix of veterans and
the Hollywood youths stamping their mark to make this a lot more
memorable than your typical, formulaic romance.<br /><br />With multiple threads running, we have Steve Carell and Julianne Moore
as husband and wife Cal and Emily, who begin the film with an
announcement that their marriage is doomed, setting off a catalyst of
events and series of stories involving their son Robbie (Jonah Bobo)
being infatuated with the family babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton),
the latter&#x27;s own infatuation for Cal, Emily and her romantic dalliance
with office colleague David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon) being the root
cause, and Cal being helped by the suave womanizing player Jacob (Ryan
Gosling) who falls hard for Hannah (Emma Stone) a lawyer who had
spurned his advances, which has so far snagged him all his targets, and
is now imparting his technique and knowledge to Cal to help him move
on. Think of it as Hitch who doesn&#x27;t provide a bill, but there to
overhaul wardrobe and attitude.<br /><br />Crazy, Stupid. Love. just about covers an entire spectrum both good and
bad, well, mostly the challenging aspects about being in love with
someone, from the feelings of being unrequited, that of what would be a
stable relationship drifting apart, of loving someone much older,
office affairs, bar pickups and one night stands, playing the field and
being played, and the list goes on. Writer Dan Fogelman packs so much
into the narrative though its near two hour runtime doesn&#x27;t get felt
thanks to the superb pacing in giving each aspect, and narrative
thread, plenty of room to develop and breathe, not leaving you feeling
that they are being rammed down your throat.<br /><br />Some may balk at how convenient the story lines all play out, and
frankly the way how the convergence was done was something that
Bollywood comedies do on a consistent basis with everything coming
together and the revelation being a moment where you inevitably pause
to take stock and shake away your complacency, and work at your memory
to pick up the clues that have been peppered throughout. It&#x27;s the same
case over here as I didn&#x27;t see much coming, save for directors Glenn
Ficarra and John Requa (whose previous film was the remarkable I Love
You Phillip Morris) to pull the rug from under my feet and making me go
&#x22;I should have known&#x22;.<br /><br />I&#x27;d always prefer Steve Carell in non comedic roles such as Dan in Real
Life, that while there are funnier moments, he doesn&#x27;t draw too much
attention to his comedic side unlike his well known 40 Year Old Virgin
role, which in some ways this contained shades of. Ryan Gosling aces
the player role with his smooth talking charms until his washboard abs
got in the way, and Emma Stone was well, Emma Stone in what would be a
typical young adult female stuck with that fantasy that her prince
charming will finally propose. Julianne Moore was a delight to watch as
the woman who had betrayed her husband and still getting confused over
her emotions, while Jonah Bobo almost stole the show with his
performance as the young man so determined and infatuated with his
babysitter, it just hurts. Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon add wonderful
supporting screen time and star-studdedness to the ensemble.<br /><br />With some incredibly witty lines that do make you want to sit up and
note that real people rarely talk like they do, scripted in a certain
way and delivered with impeccable, deliberate timing, Crazy, Stupid,
Love. is a romantic comedy that punches above its weight. It may be
rote and formulaic in some parts, but as mentioned its Bollywood comedy
inspired plot development is something fun to behold. Recommended.
