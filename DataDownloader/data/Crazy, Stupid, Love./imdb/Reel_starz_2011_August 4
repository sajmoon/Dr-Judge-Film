It was roughly two-thirds of the way into Crazy, Stupid, Love when I
realized how invested the audience in my theater had become. The key
scene involved a mom cleaning her daughter&#x27;s room, a seemingly mundane
moment that produced gasps and cries of &#x22;Oh no!&#x22; even before the
character makes a very revealing discovery. It&#x27;s a scene that, much
like the rest of Crazy, Stupid, Love, a heartwarming and, at times,
painfully honest depiction of three couples at various stages in each
of their relationships, unfolds not with predictability so much as
inevitability. Unlike your average, generic romantic-comedy, this movie
focuses less on the end, on who will end up with whom, than on the
special and often surprising connections that are made along the way.
What&#x27;s more, it achieves the remarkable and all-too-rare feat of
actually moving the audience to care about the central characters, to
cheer when they come out on top and sympathize when they don&#x27;t.<br /><br />Using a witty, compassionate and ever-so-slightly subversive script
from Dan Fogelman, directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, who are best
known for writing the pitch-black comedy/satire Bad Santa and only have
one other directorial effort under their belts (last year&#x27;s I Love You,
Philip Morris), guide the production along with subtle ease. They
strike an ideal balance between humor and drama, allowing the overall
tone to develop organically. Laughs come mostly in chuckles at the
cleverness of a line or its delivery and are never awkwardly forced in
to lighten up a scene, while the emotions feel genuine without becoming
manipulative. Most of all, their restrained approach allows the actors
to breathe and to fully embody the characters they&#x27;ve been given.<br /><br />Speaking of which, has there ever been a more likable group of people
assembled for a film, much less a romantic comedy? The cast gels
remarkably well, and at no point is anyone singled out as a villain;
even when a character threatens to become unlikable, the actor portrays
him or her with such keen understanding that it ultimately becomes
hard, if not impossible, to not root for each and every one of them.
Whenever the film tiptoes the line toward schmaltzy, they pull it back,
making every line and emotion feel utterly real. As the unquestionable
lead of the film, Steve Carell displays a tenderness and dramatic depth
he&#x27;d only hinted at in previous works like the unexpectedly moving The
40-Year-Old Virgin and occasional episodes of The Office, while Ryan
Gosling, all immaculate grooming, sly grins and twinkling eyes, is
perfectly cast as his foil, Jacob, a suave ladies&#x27; man who&#x27;s really
using all that money and swagger to disguise the emptiness he feels
inside. Julianne Moore and Emma Stone are both lovely as Emily and
Hannah, respectively, radiating a down-to-earth presence and
relatability that many other Hollywood actresses seem to lack. Also
worth noting are Analeigh Tipton and Jonah Bobo, who form Crazy,
Stupid, Love&#x27;s youngest romantic pairing and have been all but ignored
by the movie&#x27;s publicity campaigns despite their obvious talents.<br /><br />What truly sets Crazy, Stupid, Love apart from other modern-day
romantic comedies, aside from the perceptive writing and direction and
a dream cast, is that it strives to be meaningful, rather than just
mindless, predictable fluff. Though the movie employs its share of
clich&#xE9;s (precocious kid, guy falls for the one girl who initially
rejected his advances, etc.) , it&#x27;s often done with a knowing wink,
most obviously when, after an altercation with Emily, his ex, and rain
begins to pour down on him, Carell&#x27;s despondent Cal mutters, &#x22;What a
clich&#xE9;.&#x22; It shows that love is messy, irrational, sweet and universal,
filled with regrets and tears as well as hope and joy. It celebrates
movies like Say Anything&#x85; or Jerry Maguire where sentimental wasn&#x27;t a
bad word and love meant more than sex, diamond earrings and expensive,
candlelit dinners, where those small, precious moments of quiet
intimacy &#x96; a shared look, a simple but honest conversation, a laugh, a
smile, buying a mint chocolate chip ice cream cone, a spontaneous phone
call &#x96; speak as loudly as the grandest, most dramatic, craziest
gestures.<br /><br />In short, Crazy, Stupid, Love does what the best romantic comedies do:
it gives us a glimpse into the raw, human moments that collectively
build to bring two people together &#x96; or, at times, tear them apart; we
fall in love with them just as they fall in &#x96; or, out of &#x96; love with
each other. It&#x27;s the perfect date movie, and so much more. To all the
other ones, the mediocre, cornball, lazy, offensive rom-coms and
chick-flicks out there, Ryan Gosling has a message for you: be better
than The Gap. Be better than The Gap.
