So my wife an I were at Blockbuster (yes Blockbuster! haha) and were
looking for a good comedy. Saw Steven Carell on the movie box, and said
&#x22;This should be good, let&#x27;s go for it&#x22;.<br /><br />hmmm, my wife fell asleep on minute 30&#x27;. I fell asleep on minute 50&#x27;.<br /><br />If I could sum up the movie in one word I would say... &#x22;cheesy&#x22; The
writers of this movie need help. Just having Steve Carell in the movie
doesn&#x27;t make it funny... you need to write funny stuff. It had a lot of
drama sequences and some funny skits.. but nothing original.<br /><br />Ryan Gosling&#x27;s character was so corny. He is a good actor, but his
lines were so false sounding that I thought I was watching a Saturday
Night Live &#x22;lady&#x27;s man&#x22; re-run. <br /><br />I&#x27;m surprised it has a high rating here in IMDb.
