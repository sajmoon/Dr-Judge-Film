I should say the ensemble cast are all of high caliber and the twists
just keep arriving when you least expect them. There is no slow pitch
going on here.<br /><br />I did find the babysitter relationship an unnecessary distraction in an
otherwise great film.<br /><br />Julianne Moore and Emma Stone are two of the most adorable red-heads in
Hollywood and they can act!<br /><br />Ryan Gosling plays a tongue in cheek likable playboy and his lines were
history making.<br /><br />You&#x27;ll laugh and cry at several moments in this film. Go see it you
won&#x27;t regret anything.<br /><br />Cheers, www.TheAmerican.IE
