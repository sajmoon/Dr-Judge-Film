A father&#x27;s life unravels while he deals with a marital crisis and tries
to manage his relationship with his children.<br /><br />For one, I saw this film by accident. Missing the anticipated show
times of Horrible Bosses, I settled down for this. Not having the best
of intentions, I suspected an average comedy from Steven Carell. But
lighten up your expectations for this one folks, because it is possibly
one of the best romantic comedies of the year. The film not only has it
lighthearted hilarity, it has a touching romantic side to it too. The
balance between it was perfect for anyone suspecting either of the two.
I must point out Ryan Gosling&#x27;s performance as well. If you compare and
contrast his performance in this and Drive, you can tell the actor has
substantial range. Some parts of this movie are a bit over-the-top,
possibly being the ones that lowered the score, but nevertheless, I was
actually taken surprise by its unexpected heart. So that about wraps up
this one, I seriously recommend this to the romantic-comedy lovers.
It&#x27;ll definitely become possibly one of your favorites. If not, who
knows, you can be surprised by this movie as well. As did I. 8/10.
