This would have been a delightful film except for the presence of that
no talent Owen Wilson with his one stick whinny voice. What a flat
actor. There must have been any number of known and unknown actors who
would have been better. It would be interesting to know what strong arm
tactics were used in this casting or has Woody lost his touch.<br /><br />The film brings the audience to the Roaring 20&#x27;s in Paris where many of
the intelligentsia lived and thrived. It was a delight to see the
portrayals of Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald along with the other
literary and artistic lions of the era.<br /><br />Thank goodness for Marion Cotillard who brings a soft loveliness to
this film.
