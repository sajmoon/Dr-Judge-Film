Woody Allen, like most directors, has had some moments on pure
perfection (&#x22;Match Point&#x22;) and pure garbage (&#x22;Shadows and Fog&#x22;), but as
much as I have the utmost respect for the man, I wouldn&#x27;t say I am a
fan, I just have merely loved a couple of his movies, hated a few
others, and there are many I am sure I haven&#x27;t seen or are somewhat
indifferent about.<br /><br />However, &#x22;Midnight in Paris,&#x22; for sure, despite being one of his most
commercially successful films ever, is not one of his best works.
Despite his Golden Globe win for Best Screenplay, this is not the best
Screenplay of the year, nor is it one of Allen&#x27;s best. And despite his
Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Comedy or Musical, Owen
Wilson&#x27;s performance is nothing more than acceptable. However, despite
the inclusion of Rachel McAdams, I found this to be an alright little
film.<br /><br />Wilson plays Gil, a screenplay writer who decides he wants to venture
into more serious literature and write a novel. While in Paris with his
new fianc&#xE9;e, Inez, and her parents, Gil begins to question how he
really feels about his future wife, played by the always-annoying
McAdams, after getting slightly drunk and being abandoned on the
streets of Paris by her and her friends only to be randomly picked up
by a strange taxi just after midnight, transporting him to Paris in the
20s...a period Gil has always fantasized about.<br /><br />While transported, he meets the likes of F.Scott Fitzgerald, Josephine
Baker, Cole Porter, Salvador Dali, Ernest Hemingway, among others and
even gets his novel critiqued by Gertrude Stein, all the while falling
for a woman he meets named Adriana (played by the lovely Oscar-winning
Marion Cotillard)...and thus leading him to wonder how he truly feels
about the overbearing, non-too-supportive Inez.<br /><br />&#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; is a cute little film, just like many Allen films,
but is hardly a terribly significant cinematic entry and thus, I am not
so sure the numerous accolades it has been given, including the Golden
Globe, are really deserving. It&#x27;s a fine film but, for me, ultimately
forgettable.
