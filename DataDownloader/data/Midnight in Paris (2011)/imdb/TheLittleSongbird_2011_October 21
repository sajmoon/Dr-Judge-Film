I had been eagerly anticipating Midnight in Paris ever since it came
out. The concept seemed interesting, the cast on paper were great and I
loved a lot of Woody Allen&#x27;s early work(Annie Hall, Manhattan and
Crimes and Misdemeanours come to mind). And I wasn&#x27;t let down at all.<br /><br />To me Midnight in Paris is Allen&#x27;s most sustained and most enjoyable
movie in about 15 years. I personally would&#x27;ve loved for it to have
been a tad longer, however with that there is much to like about
Midnight in Paris.<br /><br />Starting off so promisingly with a gorgeous opening montage, one of my
personal favourite beginnings to a Woody Allen movie actually, Midnight
in Paris with its striking locations/scenery, beautiful colours and
skilled cinematography is a very well made movie.<br /><br />Also, its soundtrack has a nostalgic and appropriately romantic feel to
it. And the story is always interesting, it is splendidly dotty in its
construction which ensures it is never overly-comic or overly-serious,
but what made the story interesting for me were the literary and
painterly references, it helps to know some of them but even those I
didn&#x27;t know were done in an informative rather than heavy-handed way.<br /><br />The characters like with many other Allen movies are examples of those
you are not sure whether you would like, but learn to by the end. Owen
Wilson&#x27;s character is particularly true to this. Allen&#x27;s direction is
always assured, but aside from the opening montage and the references
Midnight in Paris&#x27;s remarkable selling point was the script, the comedy
is savvy, the romantic elements are yearning and the questions asked
are done in an affectionate manner.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t have much to criticise the acting either. Owen Wilson in the
central role was unexpected casting for me, but it was unexpected
casting that paid off for he is delightful here. Rachel McAdams is
suitably shrewish and Marion Cotillard is alluring and intelligent.
Michael Sheen and Kathy Bates are rock-solid as usual.<br /><br />Overall, a wonderful movie. 9/10 Bethany Cox
