I liked every single little thing about Midnight in Paris. Woody Allen,
one of the most astonishingly prolific writer-directors in American
film history, after a consecutive string of anxiety-induced dramas
about the cruel indifference of life, he has finally given release to a
well-deserved and surprising reflection. Believe me, reflection is the
right word. Without compromising his signature melancholy longing,
Woody has woven an utterly breezy, life-affirming and still personal
and hilarious comedy, populated by a charming and sometimes joyfully
surprising cast who look to be enjoying themselves, and the buzz is
infectious. In a now rare ecstatic mood, he daydreams about youth and
the excitement a young writer urgently wants to preserve before it
becomes smothered in the dehumanizing daily grind, takes that stress
and calmly, confidently drifts into a world he romanticizes with such
warm, savory atmosphere and a true master&#x27;s storytelling economy, and
coming to a perfectly aimed close, where the story should and must end,
and with tidy reconciliation it does, and boy, do we hate coming back
to reality when the lights go up.<br /><br />As per his usual, Woody provides one more couple at the apex of
marriage and finds conflict in that universal clash between security
and passion. Hollywood screenwriter Gil and fianc&#xE9;e Inez have
accompanied her parents to Paris and the excursion shows up their
differences in a most prickly manner. She&#x27;s all about shopping for
priceless chairs while he wants to take midnight saunters in the rain.
Indeed, he loves Paris so much he wants to move there, an idea she
rejects like he&#x27;s nuts. Meanwhile, she grows impressed by an conceited,
know-it-all professor, who precludes every pontification with &#x22;if I&#x27;m
not mistaken,&#x22; the satire being that his enlightenments are usually
untrue. One evening at midnight, dismayed by the seeming trajectory of
his life, Gil bails on her to walk alone. As he sits down to pull
himself together, an antique car drives up.<br /><br />Revealing any more would be a cruel deprivation of your pleasure taken
by the amazing grace of the film&#x27;s fluid, elegant surprises. The crisp
pace, firm cutting and old-fashioned invisible style leave you longing
for more as the movie whooshes by in 94 minutes of enchanting pleasure,
what they always meant when they used to say &#x22;movie magic.&#x22; The
indomitable soundtrack includes some of Cole Porter&#x27;s most remarkable
songs. The smart period and present-day chic wardrobe and sumptuously
arranged interiors are also entitled to year-end awards acknowledgment.
Woody, who claims indifference to his work so frankly, clearly takes
delicate care of the filming of his stories.<br /><br />Characters in his 42nd film, aside from but not exclusive of Gil
himself, have a sole crucial attribute which really provides the actors
scope to have loads of fun with their roles. The ensemble is enormously
exuberant in their typecast character parts. Cotillard is the right
choice for the charming pixie-like spirit who distills and unravels
Gil&#x27;s passion, but McAdams has the high-maintenance modern young
American woman down pat. She is the ideal distillation of how most of
Europe views us, and brings real emotions to Inez that inspire our
genuine reactions. No surprise. Woody&#x27;s invariably above marginalizing
female roles.<br /><br />Surprise is in the welcome familiar faces we stumble upon throughout.
Adrien Brody&#x27;s priceless take on a certain Spanish cultural icon, for
instance, is delectably memorable. But it&#x27;s a gem in a convention of
gems. Wilson is Woody&#x27;s best-ever casting of someone else to personify
his customary self-doubting and hung-up character. Expressing obsessive
sentiment with witty jousting and the ubiquitous dread of death are
consistent with the deep-rooted Allen opus. You surprisingly don&#x27;t wish
he were a young Woody instead as he injects lots of wide-eyed
ingenuousness along with just the right dash of the director&#x27;s classic
nebbish.<br /><br />Wilson makes Gil so genuine, so keen, about his hero worship of the
experiences he&#x27;s mysteriously introduced to. He can&#x27;t believe them, the
refreshing humility and worldly genius of them. Essentially, he&#x27;s
leading with his nose here. Both it and his performance are engagingly
bent, as is commented on subtly in the most brilliant in-joke manner in
Brody&#x27;s scene. That&#x27;s it. Starting now, no more spoilers of any kind.
This is hard for me, but necessary. The trailers don&#x27;t spoil it, but
now the reviews are everywhere and audiences have flocked to it. But by
jove I&#x27;m doing my part to preserve it for whatever it&#x27;s worth.<br /><br />I think of aged burgundy or antique clocks in regard to the spirit of
this hilarious and exciting little film. It begins with a montage of
postcard-worthy tableaux of the City of Lights in the sunlight, in the
rain, and then in the sunlight again. It&#x27;s a musing, a reverie,
clearly. But what gives it such an ebullient sense of wonder is its
eternal central theme. The story, in its clear-cut but understated way,
proposes that no matter what period we&#x27;re in, we take its value for
granted. So we reflect and see superior days gone by. And yesteryear,
naturally, is a discriminatory daydream. Allen&#x27;s profound esteem for
the film&#x27;s deliciously romantic universe doesn&#x27;t stop him from giving
it an old comic pro&#x27;s joshing as well. It all works self-assuredly and
sublimely on its own conditions.<br /><br />One would think some moviegoers might be baffled by this annual release
from the filmmaker, just as they deeply are by one out of your average
three Woody Allen films, since cultural literacy is hardly ever brought
to the movies anymore, to say the least. And yet, it&#x27;s success in
theatres is wonderful. Perhaps in an economy like this, just as
screwball romantic comedies were celebrated in the Depression, this is
the pure ideal for what the movies need more of right now. So many
moviegoers take Allen for granted, though Midnight in Paris has and
will captivate even the most worn-out old-hand moviegoers. There&#x27;s
nothing not to love about it. Either you relate to it or not.
