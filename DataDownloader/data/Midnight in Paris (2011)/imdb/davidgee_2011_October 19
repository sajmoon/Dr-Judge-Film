Woody Allen&#x27;s best movie in years, happily reminiscent of PURPLE ROSE
OF CAIRO, the most endearing of his collaborations with Mia Farrow.
Owen Wilson, standing-in for Allen himself, is klutzy without being
self-pitying. Marion Cotillard is totally ravishing as Picasso&#x27;s latest
squeeze - as Wilson observes, she gives a whole new meaning to &#x22;art
groupie&#x22;.<br /><br />Kathy Bates was probably chosen to play Gertrude Stein because of her,
ahem, physique but she dives into the role with relish. Corey Stoll&#x27;s
Hemingway not only looks a lot like old (or rather, young) Ernie but he
is given the movie&#x27;s best lines: he talks like he writes, short
sentences with a lot of &#x22;ands&#x22; and frequent references to guns, booze,
lions and women. Cole Porter mostly sings. Zelda Fitzgerald mostly
drinks while Scott frets. There are some good gags at the expense of
Michael Sheen&#x27;s annoying know-it-all art expert in the modern storyline
when Wilson comes back with stories from the artists and models
themselves. Wilson&#x27;s airhead fianc&#xE9;e and his future in-laws-from-hell
stop just short of caricature in a movie that relies for its existence
on finding the balancing spot between parody and affectionate tribute.<br /><br />The transitions from Today to (more than one) Yesterday are achieved
without any resort to special effects, the Paris locations and sets are
simply &#x22;magnifique&#x22;, the music (lots of accordion) is almost too good.
The mood is kept light and the whole film teeters on the brink of being
lightweight without ever becoming crass.<br /><br />This would be a great comedy in any era.
