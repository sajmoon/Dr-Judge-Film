Do not be tricked from the high score of IMDb. People that have voted
that high are probably Woody Allen&#x27;s movies fans. This movie is
horrible, it hardly gets 3 out of 10 points. As you have guessed I hate
Woody Allen&#x27;s movies. I was tricked from the high rating of this movie
but after I watched it I found it shallow, boring, with no-taste and
without any purpose nor meaning. The main character is a boring-writer
that has been castrated by his woman and is living in a
boring-dreamworld. I forgot to mention the annoying music that keeps
playing in the background and the endless background scenes of Paris.
Watch this only if you want to waste your time.
