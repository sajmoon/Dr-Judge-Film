Over the past forty years, Woody Allen has produced, on average, one
film a year. Various films have faded into obscurity, but nevertheless
a great deal of his work has remained. Strangely, this last decade has
seen a return to form. Allen himself admitted he has been working on
the quantity theory, that &#x27;If I keep making films... every once in a
while I&#x27;ll get lucky and one will come out, and that&#x27;s exactly what
happens&#x27;. And it certainly has happened with this.<br /><br />Midnight in Paris is the largest grossing Allen film to date.
Continuing with his recent love and exploration of Europe, we are this
time invited to the French capital, and witness not only the present
day Paris but also a much rosier tinted version; the artistic boom of
the 1920s. This light hearted Rom-Com laced with great one-liners
centres around the main protagonist Gil (a thinly disguised Allen) who
has a great admiration for the renowned city which has captured many
hearts over the years. Played perfectly by Owen Wilson, Gil is a warm,
idealistic dreamer and successful screenwriter who yearns for
completing his first novel.<br /><br />Visiting France with his rather shallow, materialistic fianc&#xE9;e, he
takes comfort not only in the beautiful Paris twilight but also some of
the greatest artists to have made an impact on the 20th century.
Excellently casted we are treated to the likes of F. Scott Fitzgerald,
Picasso, Salvador Dali and an intense, show-stopping Hemingway,
obsessed with the beauty of truth, bravery and courage.<br /><br />The film may have been so successful for a number of reasons. Owen
Wilson has stated he believes the film&#x27;s magnetism is down to the
title. Others will be wooed by the beautiful cinematography.
Personally, I believe the concept of being able to jump into a golden
age is something everybody has dreamt about at some point in their
lives. Whether it&#x27;s the 1920s or the Belle &#xC9;poque, we all harbour a
belief that the past was a warmer, happier and more pleasurable time to
live.<br /><br />Superbly scored with permeating guitar strings and haunting clarinet,
it captures both the Parisian vibe and the dreamer&#x27;s heart, allowing
the viewer to drift away to a glitzier time. Who cares if &#x27;nostalgia is
denial&#x27;. I defy anybody to view this film and not be somewhat charmed
by the charismatic City of Light. As Gil knowingly states: &#x27;the truth
is, we&#x27;re all in love with a fantasy&#x27;.<br /><br />I&#x27;m certainly in love with this film and it is without doubt one of
Allen&#x27;s most entrancing movies yet. Let&#x27;s hope Europe continues to
inspire him in the near future.
