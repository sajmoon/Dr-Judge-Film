I just saw a movie by a similar title (to my summary line) and I think
it fits perfectly. Though I still have trouble describing the movie. I
guess you know what it&#x27;s about because you either have seen the trailer
or read a summary of the plot, but I fortunately could avoid those
things and went in without knowing anything about the movie. And let me
tell you, it was great fun.<br /><br />Still not sure about the Oscar nods (while movies like DRIVE only got
one nomination), but the movie is entertaining while not really making
any sense. Or trying to explain anything. You either accept what
happens or you will be left out (or you will feel that way). Very
intriguing and maybe even thought provoking, this has a simple message
after all. Which is not a bad thing at all
