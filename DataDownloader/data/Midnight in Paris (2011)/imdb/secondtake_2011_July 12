Midnight in Paris (2011)<br /><br />Total wish fulfillment. Who wouldn&#x27;t want to drift back now and then
and visit some cultural heroes in their own time--you know, Ernest
Hemingway, Cole Porter, Picasso? <br /><br />Well, that&#x27;s all this movie does. It does it brilliantly, and in the
&#x22;flashbacks&#x22; which are really more like time travel scenes, the set
design, music, and invented dialog of these icons is terrific. Like
many people, I think Paris in the 1920s was the greatest cultural hot
spot since Florence in the Renaissance. <br /><br />But that&#x27;s all this movie really does, and if it&#x27;s enough, you&#x27;re going
to love it. The plot laid over this, including a strained and
irritating cast of early 21st Century ungrateful Ugly Americans, is
painful. Not only does it seem false (like these are just &#x22;types&#x22;
without real depth), but it&#x27;s crudely filmed (lighting and camera-work)
and actually badly acted, overall. <br /><br />You might think this was all on purpose, to contrast in every way then
and now. Certainly it&#x27;s the same crew, same writer (Woody Allen), and
same director (Woody Allen) in both parts of the movie.<br /><br />And same lead actor, Owen Wilson, who is perfect in both roles (he is
the one consistent presence). He&#x27;s a dreamy writer who likes Paris in
the rain. And he wishes he could just go back to those glory days when
the arts were spilling out of the cafes at night on the Left Bank. So,
by magic, he does, and so do we. If everything is a clich&#xE9;, it almost
has to be--Gertrude Stein played wonderfully by Kathy Bates, Zelda
Fitzgerald by Alison Pill. There are some twenty famous people who show
up (some briefly, like Man Ray, who is badly portrayed, and Josephine
Baker, who doesn&#x27;t get a speaking part, naturally). But they are all
backdrop, in a way, to the idea, the time travel foremost but also the
bigger idea that we sometimes think we&#x27;d be happier in another time.<br /><br />And the movie ends on the sweet note that in fact we just need to look
around at what we have in our time and appreciate it.<br /><br />As a movie beyond just entertainment, it&#x27;s easy to get frustrated. One
good friend of mine, a true movie buff and not a Woody Allen fan, loved
it. But he&#x27;s a nostalgia freak. In the theater, two young women got up
and left after half an hour, even while it was getting interesting. In
my friend&#x27;s case, he was taken in (as I was) by all the famous figures
and what they might have been like (and what they might say). The two
young women, I&#x27;m guessing, didn&#x27;t know the references. They didn&#x27;t know
who Scott and Zelda, Cole, and maybe even Ernest were. Or didn&#x27;t care. <br /><br />Which is an important truth in this kind of movie filled with
references. Like a lot of post-modern art, it&#x27;s only good for insiders.
Unlike Allen&#x27;s &#x22;Zelig&#x22; (a far more inventive and zany and complicated
film, if imperfect, too), the references here are mostly for an older
cultured crowd. There are hints of his &#x22;The Purple Rose in Cairo&#x22; as
well, a fantasy to another world, a seemingly (or actually) better one,
but that&#x27;s a brilliant movie filled with pathos. &#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; is
an extended trick, a one-liner, and as fun as it is, keep at least some
of your expectations slim.
