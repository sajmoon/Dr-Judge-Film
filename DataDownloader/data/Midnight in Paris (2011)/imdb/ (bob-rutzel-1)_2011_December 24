Gil (Wilson) accompanies his girl friend Inez (McAdams) and her parents
to Paris, France. All want to see everything, taste wine everywhere and
go here and there except Gil, who is writing a novel. He wants to
recapture the essence of Paris of the 1920s by going for walks and is
picked up by a 1920s Peugeot taxi and is greeted by F. Scott Fitzgerald
and another time by t.s. eliot. Through them Gil is introduced to
Hemingway, Monet, James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, Cole Porter, Picasso,
Djuna Barnes, and Alice B. Toklas. How good is that?]<br /><br />Woody Allen would probably have starred in this but he felt a younger
man who had a whining voice like his was needed and Owen Wilson was
perfect. And, he was right.<br /><br />This is the most creative movie I have seen since Forest Gump and
Inkheart.<br /><br />The movie starts with some very beautiful scenes of Paris: parks,
gardens, the Arch, the Eiffel tower, street scenes with and without it
raining. Allen took his time with this and we are all grateful for it.
Very nice.<br /><br />As we get into the story we are not sure how Gil transfers into the
past. We see the taxi and Gil gets in and then he is in the 1920s. At
first we think he may have been dreaming,or like Alice who found a
rabbit hole, and, well we really don&#x27; t know the answer to that one.
That&#x27;s Woody Allen&#x27;s secret. But, there Gil is hob-nobbing with all the
great writers and painters of the time. Funny that they never mention
the different clothes he wears. At some point he does say he is from
the year 2010, and that doesn&#x27;t seem to elicit any real emotion from
anyone as they accept it. He does give Zelda Fitzgerald a valium to
keep her calm to not commit suicide; and again the valium is questioned
but accepted.<br /><br />The only good funny line I found in here was when Hemmingway asks Gil
if he hunts. Gil replies, &#x22;only for bargains.&#x22; <br /><br />But, it is Adrianna (Cotillard) who realizes she is in the 1920s but
prefers the 1890s where she and Gil are now in the Moulin Rouge and she
introduces Gil to Toulouse-Lautrec, Matisse, and Gauguin. Is it that we
find the past more exciting to live in than our present and is it that
we don&#x27;t appreciate what we have in our present? Or are we too quick to
forget about the past? Am glad Gil didn&#x27;t meet any real philosophers as
I would really be lost. (Indeed)<br /><br />I want to tell you about the detective Eniz&#x27;s father (Fuller) hired to
follow Gil as he felt Gill was up to more than walking the streets of
Paris for inspiration for his novel. I want to tell you but I cannot.
You have to see that for yourself. HA ! Yes, it is a funny moment.
Can&#x27;t say more. <br /><br />This is excellent, quite engaging and very creative. Allen&#x27;s tribute to
the arts and to Paris, France. (9/10) <br /><br />Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No Language: No.
