Had &#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; been written/directed by a first-time film
maker, it might be considered an above average effort, or at least a
pleasant diversion. But as Woody Allen has such a large body of work
this film comes off as typical Woody Allen fare,slow, clich&#xE9;d, and rife
with light (and I&#x27;m talking&#x27; light!) humor.All of Mr.Allen&#x27;s prejudices
are exposed once again:His disdain for California and Hollywood, though
he is quite happy to take advantage of their financial backing and
distribution network; his attitude that all Americans are rubes and
stupid, except of course for New York City Jews, and Manhattan
gentiles; Oh how much he wishes America was like France, and their
&#x22;sophistication&#x22;; they might even accept a grown man marrying his
adopted daughter!In the mean time, Mr.Allen has written a tired old
movie, with a comparatively new actor (Owen Wilson) pretending to be
Woody himself.Don&#x27;t waste your time.
