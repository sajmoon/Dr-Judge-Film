Woody Allen aka Mr.Cinema proves his supremacy yet again in his recent
critical &#x26; commercial smash &#x27;Midnight in Paris&#x27;. Allen, LIKE ALWAYS,
delivers a magical film, that takes imagination &#x26; passion to a new
level. I sometimes wonder, minus Allen, would&#x27;ve Cinema ever explored
it&#x27;s actual beauty?<br /><br />&#x27;Midnight in Paris&#x27; centers on a small group of Americans visiting the
French capital for business and pleasure. The protagonist, a
screenwriter, is forced to confront the shortcomings of his
relationship with his fianc&#xE9;e and their divergent goals due to his
magical experiences in the city beginning each night at midnight.<br /><br />&#x27;Midnight in Paris&#x27; explores themes of nostalgia and modernism. Allen
this time takes us to a joyride he believes will be akin to a
roller-coaster ride, and o boy, it turns out to be just that. &#x27;Midnight
in Paris&#x27; is one of his Greatest Films to date, because it&#x27;s a magical
story, that is so well-told. Allen brings in characters he likes to
watch, and presents them the way they should be. He justifies them
beautifully via dialogue &#x26; executes their journey with great
imagination. Allen is in top-form!<br /><br />Performance-Wise: Owen Wilson makes a wonderful protagonist &#x26; he
delivers one of his best performances in here. Rachel McAdams has NEVER
been so good before. Marion Cotillard is a delight to watch, as always.
Michael Sheen is appropriate. Carla Bruni is charming. Kathy Bates
leaves a mark. Adrien Brody appears in a very brief role. Others lend
good support.<br /><br />On the whole, &#x27;Midnight in Paris&#x27; is Allen Cinema at it&#x27;s very best!
Now, We&#x27;re Talking Cinema!
