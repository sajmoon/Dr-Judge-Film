Lately it looks like I am only watching one movie a year in the movie
theatre and that is the one Woody Allen puts out. Especially the
American movie industry seems to be determined to produce only movies I
am not interested in. I have never been a big fan of Paris, so I did
not see the movie for the city unlike the movie Vicky, Christina
Barcelona, which I mainly went to see because of Barcelona. But I have
always loved period films and like everybody else I dream about having
been born at a different time and place, ignoring of course the
problems of times passed.<br /><br />Midnight in Paris transports you back in time to show you only the
positive side: the greatest artists, the most beautiful women in
wonderful clothes, delightful music and joie de vivre in a beautiful
city. So sit back and enjoy the ride. This is what movies are supposed
to do. Transport you to another time and place and let you forget the
present for the time of the movie. Plus you do not forget the movie
immediately because the thought behind it stays with you.<br /><br />Bravo, Woody Allen. And this must be one of the most beautiful movie
posters.
