At first I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think. As the movie started out
beautifully filmed, great musical score. But almost like a romantic
comedy that had gone very wrong.<br /><br />As the film progressed, something magical happened. Things started
changing, Owen Wilson descending into his writing career and engaged to
hid fianc&#xE9; - and his dream of seeing Paris in the 1920&#x27;s came true.<br /><br />From this moment on the film is pure brilliance, with Owen playing a
fantastic yet whimsical writer - that at midnight in Paris. Is
transported to the golden age of Paris in 1920. Along the way he meets
greats like Hemingway, Picasso, and Dali. All supported by a really
strong cast of actors, and a beautiful script and cinematography.<br /><br />It becomes his alternate reality. But as the way it&#x27;s portrayed, it is
indeed actually happening. His reality and fiction get intertwined in a
Pan&#x27;s Labyrinth&#x27;esque type of fantasy. The movie is a pleasure to watch
and don&#x27;t let the romantic part scare you, I won&#x27;t spoil anything but
lets just say there a quite a few twists and turns along the way.<br /><br />I think almost anyone with appreciation for good movies,
cinematography, writing, or just something heart warming interesting
and outside the box will really enjoy this film.
