The only Allen films I have seen are actually only from this decade...
crazy I know. But I&#x27;m a fan of him. Midnight in Paris is a very
charming film. Sure, it&#x27;s a little obvious at times, and its message is
as well. But it&#x27;s sort of a &#x27;fairy tale&#x27; in a way. The cast is all
superb, although Owen Wilson hits the wrong notes at times, and maybe a
better actor would have made the performance more special. Rachel
McAdams is freakin hot in here! She&#x27;s never looked better, and I find
it refreshing just how easily she can make a character either likable
or unlikable in different films. She slips into that mode so easily.
Her character is, again, a bit too obvious and not incredibly written,
but she is great. Marion Cotillard is yet again in another supporting
role, and she shines. I am still waiting for the day that she gets
another Oscar.<br /><br />Overall, I liked it enough, a very good film although it&#x27;s never as
intriguing as it could have been, or as his other films I have seen,
Match Point and Vicky Cristina Barcelona (and while the former was a
better film all around, the reason the latter is ahead of this one is
only because of Cruz in her Oscar-winning performance)
