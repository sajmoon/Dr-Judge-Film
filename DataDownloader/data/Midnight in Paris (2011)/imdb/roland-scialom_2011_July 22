Gil is a writer fascinated by the life style of the intellectuals and
artists during the twenties in Paris. During his stay in Paris, with
his fianc&#xE9;e and her parents, he seeks for inspiration and try to
connect to the spirit of those years. During the nights, instead of
going out with his bride, her parents and friends, who don&#x27;t present
any interest to him, he prefers to walk through the streets of Paris.
During these walks, he connects to the things which fascinate him. This
is the point I want to stress: the way that Woody Allen found to show
this connection is brilliant. More precisely, Gil takes a ride with
people of the twenties, in a car of the twenties which passes on the
street where he is. This ride takes him to the places where important
people get together: parties, reunions etc. In these events, he meets
Cole Porter, who plays and sings, he talks to the couple Fitzgerald,
Pablo Picasso, Luis Bunel, Salvador Dali and so on. The interaction
with these characters from the twenties helps him find himself. At the
end of the film, he annul his engagement with his rich and boring
fianc&#xE9;e from his rich bride and boring and decides to stay in Paris, in
the company of a girl from Paris, that has the simple style that
inspires him.
