To fully enjoy &#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; it helps to have some knowledge of
the world of arts and letters as it unfolded in Paris during the years
between the first and second World Wars. Without such knowledge, the
steady stream of verbal references and incarnations of past celebrities
may wear you out. Writer-director Woody Allen develops comic momentum
by transporting a young writer (Owen Wilson) back in time where he
encounters one famous Golden Age figure after another, starting with F.
Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda, then Cole and Linda Porter, Ernest
Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Luis Bunuel, Salvador Dali and others.
Sometimes the portrayals hit the bull&#x27;s eye and at other times fly off
to nowhere. For one reason or another Kathy Bates and Adrien Brody,
both capable performers, bring nothing fresh or compelling to Stein and
Dali, respectively. Michael Sheen is, as usual, outstanding as an
egotistical intellectual in the 2010 segments, delivering his lines
with an impeccable American accent. <br /><br />It&#x27;s filled with Allen&#x27;s wisdom, insight and irony, and of course
cascades of conversation, most of it scintillatingly observant, funny,
surprising and lively. He has a way of scoring a witticism and then
undercutting it before it has a chance to sit there and draw attention
to its impressiveness. His insistent puncturing of pretense and
falsehood is intact. Allen has set many movies in the past (&#x22;The Purple
Rose of Cairo,&#x22; &#x22;Zelig,&#x22; &#x22;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Sex Comedy&#x22; to name a
few) but here he takes the time travel one step further by going back
even further into the past while already there, exploring the human
longing for the golden age that never really was. And throughout we are
presented with numberless views of Paris at all times of the day and
night, rain and shine, all tied up with a beautiful romantic ribbon at
the end.
