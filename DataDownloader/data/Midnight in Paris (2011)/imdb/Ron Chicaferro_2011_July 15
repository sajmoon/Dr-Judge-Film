This is the first Woody Allen movie where I didn&#x27;t miss not seeing
Allen as an actor. The shots of Paris makes you want to get on the next
flight there. Excellent cinematography. Its a wonderful story of a
young man who realizes that its not always greener on the other side of
the hill. Its what you make of your life now that counts. Owen Wilson
does a super job playing a somewhat befuddled young writer who is
searching for happiness in his work and in his life. All the
performances are first rate - like they&#x27;ve all worked together before.
Michael Sheen has a standout performance as does Alison Pill and Rachel
McAdams. Can&#x27;t wait to see it again. It ended much too quickly!
