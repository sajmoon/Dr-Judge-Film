Woody Allen&#x27;s 2011 flick &#x27;Midnight in Paris&#x27; is a average watch. A
highly entertaining first hr works on its advantage all the way, but a
dull and dry second spoils the fun completely. I enjoyed the film,
because it had 3 hot babes in its kitty. Watch this flick if you&#x27;ve got
nothing to do.<br /><br />Woody Allen Productions has hardly done much good work in the last few
years. Whatever Works (which i didn&#x27;t think was particularly brilliant,
but we&#x27;ll discuss that in its own review) was the only successful film
from the so-called powerhouse production company. Personally, I rather
enjoyed Broadway Danny Rose, but I can understand why it was hard to
digest by most audiences.<br /><br />Whether it&#x27;s the timing, the cast, the story, the screenplay, or even
the music, Woody Allen scores in all.<br /><br />Midnight in Paris is a romantic comedy about a regular guy who&#x27;s been
around with many women, finally falling in love, but getting rejected,
and then going on a journey to redeem himself. Warm, funny at times and
definitely interesting.<br /><br />With the exception of Adrien Brody, who emerges as a rather wooden
actor, the performances were all good. The winner here is definitely
Owen Wilson as Gil, who carries a charismatic glow with him in every
frame that leaves you with not much else to look at. He&#x27;s got a very
likable quality about him and I can only see him flourish with his
future ventures. Lea Seydoux does a good job as the french girl next
door, and Kathy Bates&#x27;s role has been written out rather meaty as well
(excuse the pun).<br /><br />Fresh locations can be a bore if they are out of context, or can be
forgotten if they are used as mere background, but Midnight in Paris
uses its locations to the fullest. Add to that some good music, where
every song fits in, and you have a successful music album.<br /><br />I give this movie a much more than just &#x22;safe-to-watch&#x22; recommendation.
Highly enjoyable. Great direction, good screenplay and high production
values. Woody Allen has finally managed to crack out of the mold of
mundane.
