Truth be told, after following his career diligently through to the end
of the 80s - 1990 is in fact the end of the 80s and Alice was the last
I&#x27;ve seen of Woody&#x27;s work without missing a single one. There were
still some very good movies in the 90s but in recent years he seemed to
be making a film a year because that&#x27;s what he does. The last two I&#x27;ve
seen though technically flawless lost the special soul and personality
that was his trademark. Whatever Works of two years ago was nice and
had a great Allen feel to it (it was an old script after all) but the
plot was forced at many moments and never more so than at the end which
gave the whole experience a bad after taste.<br /><br />Well I&#x27;ve heard this one was different, and after great deliberation
decided to give Woody another shot. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed, it is as the
title said the best I&#x27;ve seen of him for a very long while. In fact the
only flaw I did find in the movie was Owen Wilson whom I do like in
many of is roles but I must say -despite looking almost like Woody
without the glasses it felt like he was busy doing a Woody imitation
and not playing the struggling writer he should have been. Every one
else was perfect. The plot flowed seamlessly the cinematography was
amazing and all the other actors were super. Even Carla Bruni played
her tiny role perfectly (which wasn&#x27;t as small as I thought it would
be) thing is her real role is another Woody trick to make sure we
always remember this is a movie. Just like Rembrandt made sure we could
see his brush strokes, Woody makes sure we&#x27;d never forget none of it is
real - it&#x27;s all his movie and his vision. Altogether it&#x27;s a real nice
clever movie to watch, not a masterpiece but not a waste of time or a
disappointment by any stretch.
