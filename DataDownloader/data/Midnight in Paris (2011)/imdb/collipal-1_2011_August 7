Director and screenwriter Woody Allen&#x27;s most recent filmography was
quite irregular, because on the one hand, he made the very interesting
movies Cassandra&#x27;s Dream and Vicky Cristina Barcelona, and on the other
hand, he also made the tedious films Whatever Works and You Will Meet a
Tall Dark Stranger. So, I did not know what to exactly expect before
watching Midnight in Paris. Would it be a forgettable scale in Allen&#x27;s
ride through Europe? Or would it be a delicious look to Paris through
an inspired filmmaker&#x27;s eyes? I am very glad to say that the answer is
the second one, because Midnight in Paris is an intelligent, very
satisfactory and hugely entertaining tribute to the cultural roots from
20th century.<br /><br />The story from Midnight in Paris is not particularly complicated or
ambitious, but it did not need that in order to keep me very interested
in its historical travel, whose purpose is not only making a tribute to
Allen&#x27;s cultural heroes, but also making valid reflections about
universal subjects on which the contemporary civilization is based, as
well as the belief that &#x22;past times were better&#x22;. And the fact that
those fascinating ideas exist into an entertaining and very funny
screenplay shows Allen&#x27;s big talent as a screenwriter. Sure, Midnight
in Paris might not have the intellectual density from Crimes and
Misdemeanors, or the emotional impact from Hanna and Her Sisters; but
that does not avoid it from being an excellent movie on its own merits.<br /><br />Owen Wilson is absolutely perfect in the leading role. His reactions to
the unusual events he lives (and the titanic figures he meets) have the
exact tone to share the surprise with the spectator, and at the same
time, he accepts everything with the necessary aplomb and credibility
to avoid more questions than the necessary. In fact, big part of the
comedy resides on those reactions; as an example, I can mention the
commentary he makes the first time he finds an old car which takes him
to the &#x27;20s. &#x22;Is that a Peugeot? A friend of mine collects them in
Beverly Hills&#x22;. Well, written is not funny; it would be better for you
to watch the movie in order to appreciate how Wilson&#x27;s performance
increments the humor, drama and sensation of amazement from the
screenplay. Rachel McAdams, Michael Sheen and Kurt Fuller are equally
good on their respective performances as capricious girlfriend,
pretentious erudite and father-in-law; however, their characters tend
to be antagonistic figures, so they are not as likable as the main
character.<br /><br />I think it was a great idea to use unknown actors to interpret various
of the historical figures which inhabit the 20th century, because that
does not contaminate our expectations of &#x22;meeting&#x22; them. The actors who
stand out in those roles are Corey Stoll, Tom Hiddleston and Adrien de
Van. The only famous actors who interpret historical figures are Kathy
Bates and Adrien Brody, and they also bring solid performances.<br /><br />The best thing if all in Midnight in Paris is that, despite its deep
cultural vein, it never feels pretentious nor inaccessible. Those who
know the works of the characters portrayed in here (even though if it
is VERY superficially, like in my case) might enjoy it a bit more for
understanding the references and premonitions about future events (for
example, the relationship between F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife
Zelda). But I think that even those without any interest in that
historical period will not have any problem enjoying this film. In
conclusion, despite a few minor fails from the screenplay, I liked
Midnight in Paris very much, and I recommend it very enthusiastically,
not only because it has definitely become into one of my favorite films
from Allen&#x27;s filmography, but also because on its own, it is a very
entertaining, perfectly directed and brilliantly written movie.
