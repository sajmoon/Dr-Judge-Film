As others wrote before me, this is one of the best Allen movies.
Although it never explains how Pender manages to get back to &#x22;normal&#x22;
Paris (something which only occurred to me several days after seeing
the film), it raises again the usual Allen topics, fans or haters will
not be disappointed. What struck me is the fact that this film has the
same love for Paris as some illustrious predecessors. &#x22;Funny face&#x22;
(Astaire/Hepburn) and &#x22;An American in Paris&#x22; spring to mind. Allen&#x27;s
version of Paris is possibly too &#x22;postcard-ish&#x22;, but this is cinema and
optimistic cinema anyway. Great thanks must be awarded to Allen for
wonderfully advertising Paris as a vacation resort and also for his use
of a great cast of French supporting actors who might get this way more
visibility in the USA (I don&#x27;t include Cotillard and Bruni in that
bunch - but for quite different reasons)
