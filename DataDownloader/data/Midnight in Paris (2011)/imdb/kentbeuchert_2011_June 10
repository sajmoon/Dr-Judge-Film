Woody&#x27;s personality, and his films, have a powerful ability to
irritate. This one, although casting as bland a set of actors as one
can assemble, strikes out into territory where Allen simply hasn&#x27;t a
clue, leading to yet another example of Allen&#x27;s misguided belief that
one can &#x22;figure out&#x22; love. Allen&#x27;s view of love is so ridiculously
inane that it can only lead to what we have here - an inanely stupid
romantic comedy. The jokes are second grade material, as usual, and the
supposedly non-comedic part is just plain gooey trash, which tries
unsuccessfully to avoid the goo by promoting his brainless &#x22;lesson&#x22;
about life. Allen doesn&#x27;t live life - he spends all his time trying to
understand what it is. Ditto for love. So far, few have ever been so
unsuccessful at doing so. I expect another dozen films from this serial
filmmaker before he finally either goes totally senile, or passes away.
Either would be welcomed news for theatergoers.
