I liked this movie probably because it is so very much unlike most
Woody Allen movies. He&#x27;s way too liberal for me and he had to get his
conservative jabs into the dialog, but I LOVED this movie!! Paris is
unbelievable scenery (I&#x27;ve been there and it&#x27;s not nearly so enjoyable
in person), and a totally charming and engulfing story line...just a
great movie~!! And I love Owen!!! Rachael did a great job in her role
but I came away being mad at her a little... It&#x27;s hard to write a lot
without giving up some of the plot so I will just say I thoroughly
enjoyed the movie and will purchase a copy of the DVD when it comes
out!~~!
