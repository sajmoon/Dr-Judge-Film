Well, Woody Allen finally found a Bogart in him . :) <br /><br />It&#x27;s been a while since I posted something for having not found a
worthy work of art and also because of my belief that worthiness is
subjective and immeasurable. Midnight is Paris is not just a movie, it
is a dream. As a movie, it exceeds expectations and as a dream, it
(contrastingly) looks real. In 1979, Woody Allen wrote &#x22;The Kugelmass
episodes&#x22; in the New Yorker, wherein the protagonist escapes into the
past, whilst striving to attain sanity in the present. Although similar
in thought, Midnight in Paris is much more than just a fantasy. It is
brilliance in movie making. At this point in time, one can most
assuredly say that Woody Allen has matched the likes of Fellini and
shifted the epicenter of perfectionism towards the West. I shall not
attempt to tell the story, but articulate myself on the subject given
the fact that no one is ever going to read this.<br /><br />The movie is about the protagonist&#x27;s journey into his fantasy, thus
paving the way for realizing a sane, fulfilling life in his present.<br /><br />Owen Wilson is a complete surprise. One can see a young, vibrant Woody
Allen in him. Even his style of delivery has been matched to that of
Allen. The character is absolutely fantastic. Having to express notions
like cognitive dissonance, disbelief, paranoia and a need to escape the
realms of the present, Owen Wilson delivers. He is believable and aptly
cast. Marion Cotillard, as always, is perfect as Adriana, Picasso&#x27;s
lover, who has married the likes of Braque and Modigliani, and may (or
may not) fall in love with Owen Wilson&#x27;s character, Gil.<br /><br />As his character grows and escapes into the delusions of fantasy,
suspension of disbelief kicks in. This is probably one of the greatest
examples of how &#x27;suspension of disbelief&#x27; can effectively be used to
convey ideas that are simple (contrast to complex notions like Science
fiction), in scenarios that are amusing and far-fletched. The only
concern about the movie is Kathy Bates playing the role of Gertrude
Stein. That, to me was the moment I suspended believing in disbelief.
Probably because of her huge body of work, but it is arguable that she
was miscast.<br /><br />If you aren&#x27;t aware of the Fitzgeralds, Alice B. Toklas, Ernest
Hemmingway, Gertrude Stein, Dali, Cole Porter, the movie is still
amusing and inspiring in a way. Some of the dialogues are absolutely
brilliant. It is irresistible to quote some lines from the movie.<br /><br />Ernest Hemingway: All men fear death. It&#x27;s a natural fear that consumes
us all. We fear death because we feel that we haven&#x27;t loved well enough
or loved at all, which ultimately are one and the same. However, when
you make love with a truly great woman, one that deserves the utmost
respect in this world and one that makes you feel truly powerful, that
fear of death completely disappears. Because when you are sharing your
body and heart with a great woman the world fades away. You two are the
only ones in the entire universe. You conquer what most lesser men have
never conquered before, you have conquered a great woman&#x27;s heart, the
most vulnerable thing she can offer to another. Death no longer lingers
in the mind. Fear no longer clouds your heart. Only passion for living,
and for loving, become your sole reality. This is no easy task for it
takes insurmountable courage. But remember this, for that moment when
you are making love with a woman of true greatness you will feel
immortal. (Courtesy of IMDb) Ernest Hemingway: No subject is terrible
if the story is true, if the prose is clean and honest, and if it
affirms courage and grace under pressure.(Courtesy of IMDb) And the
most brilliant of them all, reserved for Gertrude Stein from Allen, We
all fear death and question our place in the Universe. The artist&#x27;s job
is not to succumb to despair but to provide an antidote for the
emptiness of existence. (I typed it) Woody Allen is probably the best
American writer in the past decade. He has elevated, once again, the
benchmark of perfection. The writing is simple, unlike his other works
which makes it more compelling to watch. The subtle humor that comes
along with every single character, the typical Allen mannerisms and
above it all, Paris, makes it a movie-goer&#x27;s dream- a great one at
that.<br /><br />Rating : 9.5 on 10 .<br /><br />This review has not been corrected for grammatical errors or popular
