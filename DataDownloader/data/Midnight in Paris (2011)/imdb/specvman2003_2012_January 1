I actually thought this movie was quite entertaining and had some
rather funny parts. I was &#x22;forced&#x22; to watch WA films growing up and
could/never have understood his appeal. I don&#x27;t think any of his films
are very funny and I&#x27;ve seen about a half dozen (parents love him).
This film however appeals to a wide variety. Owen Wilson and Rachel
McAdems aren&#x27;t the only appeal but they certainly do help with the
appeal of the movie. They played their parts perfectly but the content
of the movie also should appeal to different generations and people of
varying degrees of intellectual and humorous levels. I was not familiar
with all of the characters but its not important to the overall
storyline. Overall the movie was very entertaining and enjoyable.
