Woody Allen crafts a delightful little love letter to Paris. The film
certainly isn&#x27;t without flaw, but for the most part it really is this
nice piece of movie magic. It&#x27;s a look back into a golden era combined
with a nice message about being able to appreciate what you&#x27;ve got
instead of constantly living in the past. Allen again puts together a
wonderfully talented cast to delight his audience, although some of the
characters here are written much better than others. It seemed like he
put all of his attention into crafting the time that Gil (Owen Wilson
as the Woody stand-in) travels back to at midnight, and just got sloppy
when it came to writing the present day. The characters that Gil has
surrounded himself with when we first meet him are just absurdly banal
and shallow.<br /><br />Granted, I&#x27;m sure people like that do exist in real life, but there&#x27;s
just no way I could buy that someone as decent and good-hearted as Gil
would put himself into a situation like that. Why on Earth would he be
engaged to Inez (Rachel McAdams in a thankless role), the most vain and
bothersome bitch in the world? It started off as a minor complaint, but
the further the film went on the more it started to creep into scenes
where Inez wasn&#x27;t even around and continue to bother me. It all works
itself out in the end, but it was just frustrating how we were supposed
to believe he&#x27;d put himself in that engagement in the first place. It
was lazy writing on Allen&#x27;s part; instead of creating human beings he
just created these blank shells to influence the main character.<br /><br />Fortunately, this is where my complaints on the film pretty much end.
The second Gil goes back to 1920s Paris at the stroke of midnight,
things are taken to a world of pure Woody Allen magic. The concept for
the film is incredibly unique, I&#x27;m surprised no one had thought of it
before, and feels very Woody right from the start. You take this ride
back into the past and it feels so genuine. A concept like this could
have been executed so poorly (time travel often is) but Allen doesn&#x27;t
spend too much time on the more scientific side of things and instead
has Gil almost immediately embrace this experience; and why wouldn&#x27;t
he, he&#x27;s getting the chance to live his largest fantasy. These
characters are so wonderfully brought to life by this supporting cast
here in the past.<br /><br />Every single one of them feels like you always knew they would be. You
don&#x27;t doubt for a second that these are the real people because these
actors bring them to life so naturally. Alison Pill is a scene-stealing
revelation as Zelda Fitzgerald, wild and out of control with her
emotions. Tom Hiddleston is delightfully understated as her troubled
hubby, F. Scott. Corey Stoll knocks it out of the park as the wild and
blood-thirsty Ernest Hemingway. Adrien Brody absolutely steals his
brief scene as Salvador Dali by creating one of the most hilarious
moments of the year.<br /><br />The real star though, and the star of the film, is Marion Cotillard as
a character who moves her way through these famous men&#x27;s lives. Her
Adriana is Gil&#x27;s soulmate seemingly, a gorgeous and intelligent muse
who herself feels like she is living in the wrong time and longs for a
golden age. Adriana is supposed to be this kind of woman who just casts
her spell and draws men in at every turn, and Cotillard makes you buy
it immediately. The second we meet her you fall into her spell, she is
so enchanting and wonderful it&#x27;s impossible to resist. Watching
Cotillard here, I felt like people must have felt in the &#x27;50s when
watching Audrey Hepburn really come onto the scene. She is just so
beautiful and ethereal here, making you feel exactly how it feels to
fall head over heels in love. I think this is one of her best
performances so far in her career.<br /><br />Owen Wilson pretty much does his usual Owen Wilson thing, just with a
far superior script than he usually has, but the real treat of the film
is this supporting cast back in time. In these trips to a golden age,
Allen creates so many moments of genuine movie magic. They just take
your heart in it&#x27;s hand and make you feel alive and you really
appreciate that life you have. My complaints with the supporting
characters in the modern day were a big deal to me when I was watching
the film, but since it ended all I&#x27;ve thought about are these moments
that swept my heart away. That complaint feels pretty minor when the
final product just makes me feel so good. Ultimately, the message about
not living in the past is poured on way too thick, but it&#x27;s a message
that definitely made me think about my life when I came out of it. And
boy, that ending is guaranteed to be the most purely blissful of the
year. Really leaves you with a huge smile on your face.
