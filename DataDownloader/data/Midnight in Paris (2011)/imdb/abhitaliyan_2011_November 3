&#x22;That&#x27;s what the present is. It&#x27;s a little unsatisfying because life is
unsatisfying.&#x22;: Gil<br /><br />Movie opens with a loving &#x26; surreal montage of Paris with honeyed
Saxophone playing in the background and bam! You are lost. Woody
Allen&#x27;s Midnight In Paris is mystical, risible, wistful and nervously
romantic movie which makes you fall in love with Paris. This is Woody
Allen at its best, finally giving life to his nostalgic reflection and
mesmerizing us with the romanticism of characters.<br /><br />Gil, our Protagonist here (very aptly played by Owen Wilson) is a
dissatisfied Hollywood screenwriter and a failed novelist from Beverly
Hills. He&#x27;s accompanying his fianc&#xE9;e Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her
parents in Paris for a holiday. Gil is actually a laid-back
materialization of Allen&#x27;s persona. He is fervently in love with
everything pertaining to Paris. He has always been nostalgic &#x26; moony
also. Gil regards era of 1920s in Paris as a golden period of History
and strongly desires to have lived in that era when all the prominent
artists, writers &#x26; musicians of the world donned the streets &#x26; clubs of
Paris. Gil after years of perpetual dissatisfaction as a no-substance
Hollywood screenwriter is also trying to pen a novel.<br /><br />As per his usual, Mr Allen provides us with a very diverse and
occupying mix of supporting cast. Inez is an all-about shopping for
priceless chairs girl, who is completely gaga over a pedantic
know-it-all professor &#x22;Paul&#x22;, who starts his every sentence with a
conceited &#x22;If I&#x27;m not mistaken&#x22; remark. And as if that isn&#x27;t enough,
Gil has to endure his uptight soon to be in-laws also. One evening at
midnight, disheartened by his humdrum life, Gil decides to bail on Inez
to walk alone. What unravels next is a magical experience you wouldn&#x27;t
have even dreamt of. Revealing anything more than this will be a cruel
act of depriving you of the pleasures of elegant surprises. But I still
can&#x27;t stop myself from spilling out &#x22;some&#x22; beans namely Fitzgerald,
Hemingway &#x26; Picasso.<br /><br />Coming to the technical aspects of the movie, everything from direction
to soundtrack was first-rate with Classic Allen written all over it.
Cinematography was awesome; it was not just an expression when I wrote
that movie is going to make you fall in love with Paris. No complaints
for the casting and acting department also, you couldn&#x27;t have selected
a better cast ensemble than this. Marion Cotillard was lovely as a
confused French beauty &#x26; Owen Wilson was at his hilarious best as Gil.<br /><br />In the end, Midnight In Paris is a lyrically crafted fable about
romance, nostalgia and pleasures which leaves you feeling rhapsodic.<br /><br />http://flickyfriday.wordpress.com/2011/11/04/midnight-in-paris-2011/
