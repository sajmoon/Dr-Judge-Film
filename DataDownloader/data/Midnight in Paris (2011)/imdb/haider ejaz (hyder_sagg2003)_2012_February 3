Woody Allen sure is one of my favorite directors, Midnight In Paris is
another addition to his beautiful work. The Direction, script and Art
direction of the movie is marvelous. The story is very light but it is
EXTREMELY interesting. I loved the movie and a few scenes had
exceptional humor in them. Performances are fine and the length of the
movie is just perfect so that you a entertained all the way.<br /><br />I&#x27;d love to give it a 8.5/10.<br /><br />Nominated for 4 Oscars, the movie deserves the accolades!!! Thumbs Up.
Recommended for most of viewers (Mild sexual references, smoking and
alcohol)
