Starting with Owen Wilson&#x27;s twitchy ongoing imitation of Woody Allen
himself as Gil, every situation involving his grabby neurotic fianc&#xE9;e
Inez (a perfect JAP if there ever was one), and her supposedly WASPY
Tea Party parents (who come off more like a suspicious Scarsdale
dentist and his shrewish Haddassah wife) MIDNIGHT IN Paris is an
amusing ethnic exercise primarily because Woody Allen doesn&#x27;t know
that&#x27;s what he has written.<br /><br />It would be nice if Wilson&#x27;s &#x22;blastoff into the past&#x22; didn&#x27;t include
constant ahistorical errors like &#x22;Hemingway&#x22; interrupting spouts of
unintentionally parodic passages of Hemingway prose to discuss rhino
hunting and bullfighting years before he had any exposure to either,
and decamping to Kilimanjaro with Wilson&#x27;s love interest (Marie
Cotilard), years before he had ever been to Africa and while he was
still living happily with first wife Hadley whose trust fund checks
were barely keeping them alive.<br /><br />But what the hell. Watching Wilson/Woody Allen&#x27;s constant bug-eyed &#x22;Gee
whizzes&#x22; as each celeb from the past (Fitzgerald, Dali, etc.) went into
their star turn was unintentionally hilarious... rather like a reprise
of the beginning of the guided tour of Jurassic Park, but the one truly
touching sequence when Wilson/Woody somehow caught the right carriage
to take a Marie Cotillard to her dream &#x22;golden age&#x22; to Maxim&#x27;s and the
Moulin Rouge of the Belle epoque made it all almost worth it.<br /><br />Worth an Academy Award for the blurry postcard color of daytime Paris
and the ability to pull the Woody Allen claque together behind a far
inferior movie to the marvelous VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA... .<br /><br />THis is a lousy movie, but given the ethnic makeup of Hollywood, it is
over-praised and at least Woody made some money this time.
