Unfortunately, one do miss a quality Woody Allen movie these days.
Midnight in Paris: beautiful shots of Paris but no serious plot. Yes,
many acclaimed stars, but no acting.<br /><br />Nostalgia is fine but this is very fake. I watched the film with my
mind sending the relevant past clips from other beautiful Woody Allen
films like Manhattan, Purple Rose of Cairo, Radio Days, even Vicky
Cristina Barcelona. But bringing them together does not make a nice
movie.<br /><br />I love rain in Paris but not like the last scene where the rain pours
over only the cast not the bridge; is it cost-saving? <br /><br />And after all, why do we need Owen to mimic Woody?
