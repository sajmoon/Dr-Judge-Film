For those of us who like to idealize, this film is for you! You may not
be surrounded by beautiful women or the greatest geniuses in your
generation like lucky Gil, nor be rich and engaged to nice lady.
Nevermind, some of us always think beauty/ perfection/ &#x22;meaning&#x22; lies
elsewhere. Gil idealizes the past, our thing may be different, but the
&#x22;mental process&#x22; is always the same. As Gil realizes not very quickly:
we always find the present, whatever present, a bit dull, whereas the
romanticized version of reality we choose is lacking all rough edges,
dreary routine, limits to our ambitions. &#x22;Maybe people in the
Renaissance would have liked to live in the age of a Khan :)&#x22;. As
GeneralUrsus (US) writes on IMDb: &#x22;(perhaps) we are never truly content
in whatever station we reside&#x22;. <br /><br />Maybe our narcissism tricks us into believing that &#x22;if things were/ had
been different, if we took this or that turn in life, etc.&#x22;, THEN, we&#x27;d
be happy. Gil isn&#x27;t in love with dull Inez, who doesn&#x27;t love nor even
respect him, neither do her parents (at all), and probably even Inez in
turn is holding high hopes for his pedantic friend who likes to be the
only one talking.<br /><br />Owen Wilson was a surprise for me. I really thought he was a concession
for marketing reasons but no, in a way it&#x27;s a wise cast decision: a
tanned Californian blonde may be as out of place in intellectual&#x27;s
France of the 20&#x27;s to make him a true foreigner, so his being &#x22;out of
tune&#x22; with reality may be honest after all. He is a good actor, making
us empathize with his bewilderment, curiosity and insecurities about
his work. McAdams is not as beautiful as we&#x27;ve seen her before, maybe
it&#x27;s she being tanned, dyed and with high heels, it was surprising to
me.<br /><br />Just one quibble: maybe too &#x22;didactic&#x22; and stereotyped views of our
famous authors, like Hemingway wanting to challenge everybody all the
time, Dali looks like suffering from OCD with rhinoceros, etc. Or they
addressing each other by surnames. But I am sure Woody is right: we are
not all knowledgeable in the names of 1920&#x27;s artists, let alone XIX
century painters, etc. John and Helen are also stereotyped Republican
dumb arrogant ultra rich Americans. We probably won&#x27;t get to know
anybody so rich in our lifetimes, but anyway, I feel they deserve a bit
more &#x22;fairness&#x22; than what they get. But well, given this is Art, I
found Helen&#x27;s quip: &#x22;What&#x27;s cheap is cheap&#x22; perfect for the &#x22;insatiable
mother-in-law&#x22;, in that she&#x27;s almost universal :). Hemingway is
particularly well cast, as familiar face Kathy Bates as Stein. I found
Brody as Dali as somewhat distracting me from the real character, but
that&#x27;s probably me. L&#xE9;a Seydoux and Marion Cotillard vie for our hearts
of romantic movie goers, it&#x27;s hard to choose, Gil says it right when
looking at beautiful working women at Pigalle: &#x22;I&#x27;m afraid I like them
all :)&#x22;. Adriana is probably more of an alluring tragic character, you
can feel sadness by the way she looks. <br /><br />My favourite character is Gad Elmaleh&#x27;s private detective. A well known
actor in France, from &#x22;La doblure&#x22; among others, here it&#x27;s a clueless
detective (!), a bit like all of us in this film, and maybe in life
too. Paul is the funny to hate rival, a cautionary tale for all of us
who think that trying to be intelligent and &#x22;know about many things&#x22;
will make us interesting while it only transforms us into bores that
even a tourist&#x27;s guide will remember with a frown :). I&#x27;d have liked
Carla a bit more of screen time, but her goddess charm adds light to
any project she participates into. I hope she&#x27;ll keep on acting :)! <br /><br />I could go on and on about this film but what I want to highlight is
that while it&#x27;s an ode to the past, nostalgia, and unfulfilled dreams,
it also cries in a beautiful way: &#x22;Seize the present!&#x22; and &#x22;Choose the
best from what&#x27;s available&#x22; for it&#x27;s the only thing that&#x27;s real, the
only thing that we&#x27;ll ever have. The Woody Allen reader has a funny
quote about steaks that says it better than we could ever do, in an
American &#x22;matter-of-fact&#x22; way that is refreshing.<br /><br />Enjoy this movie, you just won&#x27;t regret it!
