The story is about Gil(Owen Wilson) who lives in Hollywood, and hopes
to a great novelist one day. Gil and and his fianc&#xE9;e(Rachel McAdams)
are vacationing in Paris, and Gil starts to see the amusement of living
there, and wonders what life in Paris in the 1920&#x27;s must have have been
like? Until one night he gets that wish, while strolling through Paris,
A car from the 20&#x27;s picks him up, and is brought into the past, and
meets famous like Cole Porter and Ernest Hemmingway, but how will this
all play when he gets back to present? <br /><br />Woody Allens best film to date, what I heard on how he gets such a
large cast of actors, he never puts demands on them, he lets them do
there characters has they see fit. Owen Wilson was good here, making up
for the forgetful Hall Pass. Rachel McAdams, Kathy Bates, Marion
Cottilard, and Alison Pill. Woody Allen gives a great view of Paris, he
tries to make audience feel like your really there, please check this
humorous, magical out.
