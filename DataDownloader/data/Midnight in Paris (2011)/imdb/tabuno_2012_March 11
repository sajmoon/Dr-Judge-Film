I found Midnight in Paris unbelievable, unappealing, and
unapproachable. Woody Allen&#x27;s imprint is all over this movie, but his
fantasy theme failed to carry over onto the movie screen. The dialogue
and scenes were dissociated from any emotional connection and became
more of visual and auditory reading of Woody Allen&#x27;s own mental
musings. He failed to capture the intense flavor and rhythm of Paris,
insisting on his scripted words. He had Gil (performed by Owen Wilson)
becoming a one-dimensional, monotone character who remains in an
oblivious state throughout the movie. Add to Gil&#x27;s unappealing
character, an even more obnoxious fianc&#xE9; who can&#x27;t even be made to
appear sexually seductive even needed. How can these two characters be
together in the first place? This relationship is a mere a plot device,
adding to the absurdity of the movie. Later Gil meets Adrianna played
by Marion Cotillard&#x27;s (the most important relationship) whose wonderful
and delightful character watches helplessly with fewer script lines as
Owen Wilson&#x27;s character remains blank to the different surroundings
that he takes in so nonchalantly at odds with the circumstances. If
only Wooden Allen had made Marion Cotillard the primary character, then
perhaps her performance or character itself might have been able to
carry the movie sufficiently to make it bearable to watch. As it is,
Gil unintentionally becomes a parody of the comedic Jerry Lewis or Don
Knott&#x27;s idiot character appearing as witless lout who cannot possibly
be this amazing, creative writer.<br /><br />By a small stretch of the imagination, it seems like the characters in
Midnight in Paris are, at times, just following Woody Allen&#x27;s direction
in a stylistic, deliberate way that don&#x27;t reflect any authentic
performance, many appearing as robotic on the screen. If only Gil had
been inebriated or Woody Allen had incorporated Rod Serling&#x27;s The
Twilight Zone (1959-1964, television series), the movie might have been
more approachable as a fantasy. The needed suspension of belief
required in a fantasy is made even more difficult with Kathy Bate&#x27;s
character being like Kathy Bates. Even in her beginning scene seems as
if she was reading her lines off a cue card or teleprompter. Midnight
in Paris is scattered throughout with dialogue with so much lofty
intellectual mumbo-jumbo as if being spoken from a script &#x96; or lifted
from the old live radio theater which doesn&#x27;t really transfer well onto
film. There are the sudden shifts from modern-day Paris to the past and
back against without any of mysterious, mesmerizing blending of
eeriness. Over a quarter century earlier, director Fred Haines
successfully created a more haunting, subtle, mystically surrealistic
movie adaptation of Herman Hesse&#x27;s Steppenwolf (1974).<br /><br />Woody Allen introduces extras like the zombie walking man pushing a
hand-cart that only heightens the wooden feeling of and detachment of
the movie. There&#x27;s an irrelevant dog extra scene, an unnecessary
stealing from the wife&#x27;s jewelry case scene. There&#x27;s the inclusion of
the underdeveloped private investigator scenes that only serve Woody
Allen&#x27;s need to arrive at a more surprisingly common place American
ending. Such devices are more the stuff of Peter Seller&#x27;s slapstick
comedy The Pink Panther (1963) instead of Woody Allen&#x27;s more
sophisticated romantic comedy New York-style. He then misses such
opportunities of tapping into the magical appearance of a horse
carriage. When it only takes an extra with brief scenes as a shop girl
to carry the aliveness of the entire scene, her brief realness and easy
flowing portrayal only serves to emphasize how lost and empty most of
the main characters have become, especially Gil. Woody Allen&#x27;s script
only offers tantalizing glimpses of a multitude of famous people from
the past, but they only seem to be inserted as cute cameos. The whole
movie ends up to be drops of tid-bit fragments &#x96; of what psychologists
would define as &#x22;loosening of associations&#x22; often associated with manic
patients (Trzepacz and Baker, 1993). In a way, this movie is
reminiscent of the award winning California Suite (1978) written by
Neil Simon that didn&#x27;t connect well with the audience or of the adapted
screenplay movies Noises Off (1992) or Chorus Line (1985) neither of
which transferred well to the movie screen.<br /><br />In some ways, Woody Allen&#x27;s script is stuck in the past that is both
predictable and not as spontaneously charming as it should be. Woody
Allen continues passing up opportunity after opportunity to create a
more gripping, raw, and compelling relational, morally intriguing
movie. Instead he offers up only an odd and confusing choice between
Gil&#x27;s fianc&#xE9; and Andrianna where there is really no suspense nor build
up. Much more compelling and engaging movies are the more thought
provoking Anthony Hopkins&#x27; Slipstream (2007), the more daring stark
play-as-a-movie Dogville (2004), or more recent complex sci fi action
romance Inception (2010). A better time travel movie that retains its
charm is Kate &#x26; Leopold (2001) or the less well known Time After Time
(1979) or The Lake House (2006) each of these movies having more appeal
possessing captivating adventure and energy. Midnight in Paris instead
is distance, jumping through haphazard scenes, underdeveloped plots,
and character much like an unfinished jig saw puzzle that still leaves
hundreds of individual or grouped pieces scattered about making the
movie a disaster. Instead I would check out Time Bandits (1981),
Pleasantville (1998), The Time Traveler&#x27;s Wife (2009), Somewhere in
Time (1980), Back to the Future (1985) or Peggy Sue Got Married (1986).
Even the animated Caroline (2009) or Spirited Away (2001) offers
similar but more involved, enchanting fantasies or a movie with the
same foreign flavor and love essence, A Man and A Woman (1966) quietly
dazzles and enriches with an intimately involving relationship.
