This film is highly recommended.<br /><br />There are those who live in the past, those who celebrate life in the
present, and those who look to the future for happiness. Director and
screenwriter Woody Allen poses many questions in his sophisticated
romantic comedy, Midnight in Paris : Do we romanticize the past to make
our present and future seem bleak and remote? Can we ever appreciate
the present and view it with the same glorious rose-colored glasses of
the past? Does our sense of reality become impaired with what was, what
is, and what will be? Can we ever learn to accept the time and place in
which we live? Interesting musings persist in this amusing and clever
film.<br /><br />Filling in for Allen and giving a fairly accurate impression of the
comedic actor down to his halted speech patterns and sardonic demeanor
is Owen Wilson as Gil, an American writer and tourist inspired with the
Parisian way of life and nostalgic for the Golden Age of yore. He and
his shrewish fianc&#xE9;e, Inez ( well acted by Rachel McAdams ), are there
meeting her well-to-do conservative parents on holiday. This engaged
couple really are opposites from the start: she prefers socializing,
hobnobbing, and parties; he enjoys the arts, solitude, and
introspective moments. At an elite party, Inez meets a pompous college
professor ( a note perfect Michael Sheen ) with whom she becomes
infatuated while Gil becomes alienated and exasperated by the whole
social jet set. <br /><br />That evening, around midnight, Gil walks the rain soaked streets of the
City of Lights and becomes lost. He stumbles across some partygoers who
magically transport him back in time to the twenties, his favorite
idealized time era, where he later meets his romantic muse, Adriana,
mistress to Picasso, Modigliani, and his personal guide to the better
life. Adriana is perfectly cast by the charming and lovely Marion
Cotillard who brings such grace and enchantment to her pivotal role.<br /><br />Once touched by the romance of a bygone era, Gil eagerly goes it alone
whenever the witching hour approaches, in hopes of mingling with the
likes of literary celebrities and artists of the past: F. Scott
Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stall as the writer gets to deliver
some of the script&#x27;s best lines), Salvador Dali, Gertrude Stein, etc.
There is much name dropping and celebrity stereotyping as Gil timehops
to the past which gets to be a bit of a monotonous plot device; yet it
gives the film its intellectual and aesthetic appeal and emphasizes
Allen&#x27;s unique spin, ironic wit, and sparkling dialogue.<br /><br />Just as the director&#x27;s earlier masterpiece Manhattan was his cinematic
love letter to New York City, Midnight in Paris becomes one of his best
films in years, It is his personal rendezvous with one of Europe&#x27;s most
romantic of destinations and Allen shows the city in all its glorious
splendor. Yes, the city and his dreams successfully seduce Gil in this
delightful flight of fancy ( or fantasy, in this case ) and Allen has
thoroughly bewitched his audience with his magical modern day fairy
tale of love and romance. GRADE: B+<br /><br />NOTE: Visit my movie blog for more reviews: www.dearmoviegoer.com
