During their trip to Paris, Gil and his fianc&#xE9;e, Inez are passing
through a crisis. They find out some faults in each other, which
prevent them from spending this visit in the city of love in a romantic
way. As a result, the couple use the charms of Paris separately and
then discover that they have very different expectations and needs.<br /><br />In brand-new Woody Allen&#x27;s romantic comedy, Midnight in Paris, the main
character, unfulfilled writer Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) literally finds
his place in the twenties. He is time traveling to his favorite epoch,
where he meets new companion. Honest to the bone and impulsive
Hemingway, Fitzgerald devoted to his crazy wife, Picasso&#x27;s muse &#x96;
Adrianna (Marion Cotillard), who of course turns Gil&#x27;s head, and
warmhearted Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) &#x96; his own reviewer, become an
inspiration to his novel. Every midnight Pender abandons Inez (Rachel
McAdams) and her sophisticated friends, so as to escape into the world
of his dreams.<br /><br />While accompanying Gil in his night trips through the streets of Paris,
the spectators can truly feel the atmosphere of the city with all
senses. For instance, we admire the view of beautifully illuminated
alleys and obviously breathtaking Eiffel Tower. Our ears are coddled
with the French music of the 1920s. We can even smell the perfumes of
elegant ladies, who enjoyed themselves at the same party as Gil did, or
taste &#x22;the diamond whiskey sour&#x22; drunk by Hemingway in one of the bars.<br /><br />Once again Woody Allen says about love from another point of view. He
notes that true love is when we are accepted as we are and have support
in fulfillment of our dreams. The main idea of the movie is to show
that pretending to be someone else and cheating ourselves won&#x27;t make us
happy. The key is being yourself and waiting for the person who will
share our interests.<br /><br />I really recommend Midnight in Paris to anyone, who would appreciate an
intense plot filled with a pinch of romance and also a little bit of
adventure, which takes place in the romantic capital of Europe. I was
delighted by the idea of putting such a beautiful message in a comedy
with the elements of fantasy. What&#x27;s more, for those who are fond of
1920s, the brand-new Allen&#x27;s movie is a great opportunity to observe
the profiles of the then artists, who were, in my opinion, perfectly
played. By the way, applause for Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali!
