&#x22;Elusive Perfection: Enchanting, Likable Inspiration&#x22; Woody Allen
directs a mish mash of great actors and actresses in &#x22;Midnight in
Paris&#x22; bringing them together to create a story about a man&#x27;s
enchantment in Paris. The best Woody Allen movie made in years is much
more majestic than his previous work and feels much more lighthearted
than his typical films. Shadows of the charm of &#x22;Annie Hall&#x27;s&#x22; success
are present, as Owen Wilson (&#x22;Hall Pass&#x22;) becomes a star once again.
Wilson&#x27;s happy-go-lucky attitude combined with his early artsy roots of
&#x22;Bottle Rocket&#x22; make his interpretation of a successful, laidback
Hollywood writer Gil the most likable character of the year. Gil is in
love with the city of Paris and wishes and is infatuated with life in
an earlier time period (the 1920s). Consequently, when Gil and his
fianc&#xE9; Inez (Rachel McAdams, &#x22;Sherlock Holmes&#x22;) travel to Paris with
Inez&#x27;s parents, he becomes lost in the city as he struggles to finish
writing his first novel. Gil is searching for inspiration stumbling
upon a routine of walking through Paris after midnight. Inez does not
support his ambitions and instead goes out with her old stereotypical
snobbish French cultured friend Paul Bates (Michael Sheen, &#x22;Tron:
Legacy&#x22;) and his wife Carol (Nina Arianda, &#x22;Win Win&#x22;). None of this
really matters though as the golden art of cinema is revealed with
Gil&#x27;s story as he meets various characters played by Adrian Brody
(&#x22;Predators&#x22;), Marion Coltiard (&#x22;Inception&#x22;), Tom Hiddleston (&#x22;Thor&#x22;),
Alison Phil (&#x22;Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World), and Kathy Bates (&#x22;The
Blindside&#x22;) in the illusion of his night pursuits.<br /><br />Owen Wilson has one of the year&#x27;s best performances creating one of the
most likable characters to ever be on the silver screen. Owen Wilson&#x27;s
personality was perfect for the role, however, his success is ascribed
by his ability to delve deeper into his character creating a subtle
Oscar worthy performance. The rest of the cast speaks for itself with a
handful of contemporary A-list stars guided by an articulate original
screenplay of believable imagination. Lastly, praise for the city of
Paris is well deserved because without the city where would the movie
be? Woody Allen makes one clich&#xE9; mistake with the development of Rachel
McAdam&#x27;s character Inez. McAdams has a solid performance; the problem
is that Inez is portrayed as a complete selfish bitch throughout the
film&#x27;s entirety. Therefore, this brings up questions about why Gil and
Inez are together in the first place.<br /><br />An elusive rom-com about a man&#x27;s discovery of inner harmony allowing
him to find someone that understands him. Magic in the modern day
setting has never been more humorous, convincing, or perfect.
