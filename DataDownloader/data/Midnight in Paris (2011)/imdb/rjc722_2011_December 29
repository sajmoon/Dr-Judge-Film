Woody Allen&#x27;s first screenplay What&#x27;s New Pussycat was produced in 1965
and I&#x27;m happy to say after forty six years and forty something films
later...he&#x27;s still &#x22;gettin it done&#x22;. Midnight in Paris is the most
recent Allen opus and like previous works Match Point, Scoop and Vicky
Cristina Barcelona he utilizes a European back drop with the same
visual charm he used on Manhattan for the first three quarters of his
career. Ironically, the city of lights seems a natural fit for Allen&#x27;s
love of the artistic side of any large metropolis.<br /><br />The film stars Owen Wilson in a role that Allen himself could have
played thirty years ago (a trend in many of Allen&#x27;s newest works). As a
Hollywood screenwriter longing for the art and romance of a bygone
time, Wilson surprisingly inhabits the nebbish qualities of a typical
Allen leading man. Rachel McAdams is his frustrated fianc&#xE9;&#x27; and Oscar
winner Marion Cotillard plays his &#x22;muse&#x22; or as Allen aficionados may
call it&#x85;his Parisian &#x22;Annie Hall&#x22;.<br /><br />The premise and characters are obviously similar to many Allen films,
which of course is not a bad thing (if it&#x27;s not broke, Woody doesn&#x27;t
fix it). However where it excels is its combination of a classic Allen
theme with an exquisite period piece. In addition to the beautiful
costumes, sets and production value the really fun aspect of the film
is guessing just who may show up in 1920&#x27;s Paris. Whether it&#x27;s Kathy
Bates&#x27; Gertrude Stein, Adrian Brody&#x27;s Salvador Dali (and if you&#x27;re
keeping count that&#x27;s two more Oscar winners) or Corey Stoll&#x27;s Ernest
Hemingway, the parade of colorful and historic people inhabiting the
social scene of France is a literal who&#x27;s who of artists, writers and
dancers. Needless to say there is also a fair amount of verbal dry wit
and humorous dialogue to balance out the beautiful setting and story.<br /><br />What this film demonstrates more than anything is Allen&#x27;s durability in
still putting out good films after over four decades as a filmmaker&#x85;a
feat not easily accomplished, especially for comedies. He averages a
film a year and even his contemporaries Mel Brooks and Mike Nichols,
comic geniuses in their own right, have not had as much consistent
success. Keep them coming Woody.
