I have always been a Woody Allen fan but let&#x27;s face it his decade-long
European sabbatical has hardly produced anything remotely memorable
until now. The switch in genre from those uninspiring melodramas to
romantic fantasy works perfectly. It can be no coincidence that Owen
Wilson was chosen to play the leading man for a part that Allen clearly
wrote with himself in mind. Without ever consciously mimicking Allen
Wilson manages to put across that same angst and self-doubt in an
amusing and totally charming performance. Indeed it is difficult to
think of another actor attempting it without resorting to
impersonation. Marion Cotillard lit up the screen as usual. Has that
woman ever appeared in a bad film? The photography was also worthy of
comment. Paris was made to look the centre of the universe and even in
pouring rain it looked completely irresistible.Woody Allen should
receive the freedom of the city for his contribution to French tourism.
