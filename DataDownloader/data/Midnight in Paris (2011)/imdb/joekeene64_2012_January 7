This movie is a fun and enjoyable experience. The movie provides great
atmosphere of Paris and really makes the viewer feel as if they are in
the roaring twenties.<br /><br />Owen Wilson is the perfect actor for this role with his unassuming
demeanor and funny wit. Rahel McAdams plays the uptight wife perfectly.
The plot is very entertaining and the movie was never dull. The movie
conveys a strong message about life in general and also provides
comedic relief. It was great seeing Picasso, Hemingway, and others out
and about in Paris. <br /><br />Everyone should check it out immediately.
