Being a Woody Allen fan doesn&#x27;t make me the most objective of
reviewers, but after seeing this I have to admit it: Woody Allen has
done it again! Contrary to his most recent films (and mind you I
thought Vicky Christina Barcelona was really mediocre) Midnight in
Paris leaves you with the most pleasant flavour of bittersweet
nostalgia that makes your heart beat at a faster pace. With an
incredible plot vehicle, remarkable acting and a marvellous scenery,
the film is bound to entertain, with the real sense of the word. The
humour is a bit difficult to catch for anyone who skipped his Art and
Modern History classes, yet it manages to provoke laughter even if you
don&#x27;t take all the jokes. Owen Wilson is great as the &#x22;Woody&#x22;
character, Marion Cotillard is extraordinary as always, and the rest of
the cast ensemble is also in great shape. I loved Adrian Brody&#x27;s scene,
while I also enjoyed very much Kathy Bates, who is an incredible
character actor. The idea behind the film is very clever, reminiscent
of the Purple Rose of Cairo but taking it to a whole new level, and
also quite thought-provocative. All in all a great film certainly not
one to miss!
