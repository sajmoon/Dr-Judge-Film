&#x22;I don&#x27;t know what it is about this city.&#x22; Gil (Wilson) is a struggling
writer who is visiting Paris with his fianc&#xE9; Inez (McAdams). After
meeting Inez&#x27;s new friends who he doesn&#x27;t like he decides to take a
walk. When the bell strikes midnight his life is changed. I need to
begin by saying that I am not a Woody Allen fan. I have like &#x22;Match
Point&#x22; and &#x22;Whatever Works&#x22; but that&#x27;s about it. This is, in my opinion
his best movie. While not as funny as &#x22;Whatever Works&#x22; this one is very
enjoyable and is not a typical Woody Allen movie. The time travel
aspect in this is very interesting and is used very well and not in a
cheesy fashion at all. If I was more into literature I think parts
would have been more interesting, but I really enjoyed this movie.
Overall, a very light-hearted and enjoyable comedy that is one of, if
not the best Woody Allen movie I have ever seen. I give it a A-.<br /><br />*Also try - Somewhere In Time &#x26; You Will Meet A Tall Dark Stranger
