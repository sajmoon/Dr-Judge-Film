Woody Allen&#x27;s 41st movie called &#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; is one of the best
films of the year, and surely is. I really loved some Allen films, and
there are a lot of them, but this one, feels like it could have been
released in early 70&#x27;s or the 80&#x27;s, anyways, still a damn great movie.
Allen always has a humor and heart in many of his movies, I laugh and
cry and feel appreciated every time I finished watching any Allen
movie. Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, lead the movie in here with some
surprise actors as well which also did a good job also in the
performances. And what I also loved, is the plot which also reminds me
of &#x22;Purple Rose of Cairo&#x22;, in which there&#x27;s a fantasy but it didn&#x27;t
explain well, and to me, that don&#x27;t need an explanation. I seem to
think also that Owen Wilson is great in here and funny, that is kinda
like a Woody Allen persona, that never stops and think what to say next
or getting nervous to a woman! And to this movie, there&#x27;s like 3 women
that fell in love with him, there&#x27;s his fianc&#xE9;e, and a woman from the
20&#x27;s, and a woman selling some old records. This women might change his
personality and look to himself. This movie doesn&#x27;t provide some boring
and lazy dialogues, it is rather interesting. I love how these people
talked about the American literature and it&#x27;s impact to the society, as
seen in Wilson&#x27;s character. It also tells us that he is not crazy or
hallucinating, maybe that&#x27;s his imagination for successfully finishing
his novel, yeah, he&#x27;s a writer. I also loved, how Woody Allen put in
his film some famous people like, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest
Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso, Luis Bunuel. Gosh! I have
never think of any other Allen film that has a real life characters,
and this one provides it, with such delightfulness and joy that makes
the audiences think that Allen is not parodying them, it views them as
a real person and a smart person. Even though, at the end, he agrees to
stay in Paris, still we can say that the movie is such a treasure that
we never had ever since I think, &#x22;Annie Hall&#x22; maybe? And it&#x27;s also one
of the best romantic comedy of the year, if not maybe the most happiest
filmmaking I have ever looked at.<br /><br />&#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; is really great and maybe Allen&#x27;s best in a very
long time. I know he&#x27;s old and still writes and makes movies, and he
loves it. I&#x27;m sure if Woody Allen dies someday, I wish not today, I&#x27;m
sure he will be remembered by some of his best film&#x27;s, and now this
film is included, maybe his last or maybe there&#x27;s gonna be another one?
