Owen Wilson incarnates the younger Woody Allen borderline neurotic
protagonist and acts with the same intonations of earlier Allen when he
was acting. It was so eerie that I kept confusing them or seeing some
Allen in Wilson most of the film.<br /><br />The open sequence is a cinematographic homage to Paris that works and
gets you right into it. The film is as much a tribute to the city and
to all vibrant cities as his earlier Manhanthan was for New York.<br /><br />Then humour, situation and great dialogue and acting starts. The
engaged couple interaction between each other and with other couples
(friends and parents) is typical great Woody Allen writing. This film
is quirky and becomes even quirkier with time, only to work as a whole
in the end.<br /><br />Woody&#x27;s imagination is rampant and his love for previous artist who
overshadow the love his protagonist has for his fianc&#xE9; or vice versa go
sometimes into the realm of masturbatory fictional writing and
fantasizing, but shine through with the themes, including love, art and
the concept of time and of a golden area.<br /><br />My favourite scene which I never tire of seeing is Adrian Brody being
brilliant as the genius and eccentric Salvador Dali. He has this
satirical version of Dali to perfection (with the quintessential help
of Allen as the writer/director) and I could only have asked to see
more of him than the brief scene in which he appears and appeal.<br /><br />Rachel McAdams, Kathy Bates and especially Marion Coillard also shine
as actresses.<br /><br />Thanks again Woody! <br /><br />A moody and worthwhile revelation and mockery.
