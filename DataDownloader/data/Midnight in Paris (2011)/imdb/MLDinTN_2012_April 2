I thought it was very mediocre approaching boring. Nothing exciting or
funny or entertaining even happens. And I certainly didn&#x27;t think any
actor deserved an acting nomination in this. Owen Wilson plays Gil, a
writer trying to write his first novel. He&#x27;s in Paris with his finance
and her family and they are seeing the sights. One night at midnight,
he gets into this car and some how ends up in the 1920s; this part is
never explained. So, he meets some of his favorite writers and artists,
like Fitsgerald, Hemmingway, and Picasso. He also meets Picasso&#x27;s
girl,that he likes and this makes him see, he shouldn&#x27;t marry his
finance.<br /><br />And all this magic makes him want to movie to Paris, and he meets a new
Parisan girl. The end.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: I didn&#x27;t find much good about this, I don&#x27;t recommend
it.
