I loved this movie! It blends film noir with Stardust Memories, The
Purple Rose of Cairo, and a bit of Annie Hall. The scenes of Paris were
enough to make one fall in love. The music was superb! Having all the
artists and writers show up was the ultimate name dropping contest!
Their caricatures were hysterical! Casting Adrien Brody as Salvatore
Dali was mind blowing, along with the surreal discussion about a rhino. <br /><br />I think Owen Wilson is the best Woody Allen by far. He has a kind of
naivete that seems to fit perfectly with who Woody seems to be and the
combination of Owen&#x27;s good looks with Woody&#x27;s humor is riveting! <br /><br />Of course the &#x22;nostalgia&#x22; theme and the -I really want to be somewhere
else because it&#x27;s too boring here- give the story a whole other layer
of meaning. For we artists and writers it&#x27;s one of the things that
sparks our creativity, so I loved this discussion and the never ending
unraveling the story provokes. While he&#x27;s entertaining you, getting you
to laugh hysterically about it all, you&#x27;re actually getting the point
he&#x27;s trying to make! There is no one who is so brilliant! Enjoy!
