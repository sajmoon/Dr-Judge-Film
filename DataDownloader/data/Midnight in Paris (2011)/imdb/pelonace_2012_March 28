Who wouldn&#x27;t want to relive the glory days of Paris? Though at what
cost? Is it because we are unsatisifed with our own current lives that
we must seek some sort of escape to go back in time to a time when
things were &#x22;better&#x22;.<br /><br />Owne Wilsion goes to Paris with his Fianc&#xE9; for a vacation with there
her parents but when they are there Wilsion is just over excited with
all the history and beauties that Paris has to offer. He gets so
wrapped into it that one night hes walking the desolate streets of late
Paris. He meets some of the most influential, magnificent writers and
painters of the roaring 20s. Its something he could only dream of
actually come true, but when he keeps visiting the past he starts to
question if he really is happy to be in the past or just the fact he
gets to escape from his mundane life that he is unsatisfied with. <br /><br />He starts to loose touch with his Fianc&#xE9; who is played by Rachel
McAdams who doesn&#x27;t really understand the obsession that Wilsion has
with Paris and doesn&#x27;t really want to understand. Wilsion just shrugs
it off because its his Fianc&#xE9; what can really do, its only when he goes
through some sort of transition when going back in time to the golden
age of Paris. <br /><br />I never really watch movies like this, but it really touched my inner
cavalcade of appreciation of what we use to have and what we have now.
Yes we can go back and live in our favorite era, but it will never do
us no good, because the life we live now will be our real era and we
can&#x27;t do anything about, good or bad.
