Words fail me to describe what a joyous, extravagant, and unbelievably
beautiful experience Midnight in Paris gave me. Not only did it immerse
me inside its world of fantasy, whimsicality, and gentleness, but it
gave me a strong superficial aspect I believe only myself, aspiring
journalists, and veteran journalists will be able to extract from it.
It&#x27;s a close to home work of ravishing art.<br /><br />Owen Wilson is the Woody Allen character here. In almost every Woody
Allen film, the main male character connects in some way with Allen
himself. This time we supposedly see the romantic version of Woody who
is shy, naive, and unassuming in his destiny to &#x22;make things click.&#x22;
Wilson plays Gil, a self-proclaimed &#x22;hack&#x22; Hollywood screenwriter who
has been working on a novel his fianc&#xE9;e Inez (McAdams) has dubbed &#x22;a
romantic daydream.&#x22; They are visiting Paris with Inez&#x27;s parents, and
Gil is desperately seeking motivation to finish his novel at the same
time bask in the glory of his favorite city in the world.<br /><br />One night, Gil takes a walk and as soon as the clock strikes midnight
he becomes ultimately transported into his nostalgic fantasy, 1920&#x27;s
Paris. The transportation isn&#x27;t the cartoony skit we would&#x27;ve thought.
It happens instantaneously, without any clear change except for the
setting and the characters. He meets many of his idols including F.
Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway.<br /><br />After having one night of incredible, indescribable circumstances, Gil
takes another midnight walk the next day to be transported back to the
20&#x27;s. Over time, he falls in love with the lovely Adrianna (Cotillard),
who is dating Pablo Picasso. Adrianna is everything Inez isn&#x27;t.
Tolerable, easygoing, and supportive of his work. Inez seems to
preoccupied after running into an old College flame shortly in their
trip.<br /><br />Being an aspiring journalist, Midnight in Paris spoke to me using words
that would be void of meaning if came from an actual person. Here&#x27;s a
man that escapes reality by visiting a time period he was never able to
experience, talking to his idols he never got to know personally. I
would love to go to the eighties and nineties and see my personal idols
like Corey Feldman, Corey Haim, Gene Siskel, Kevin Smith, and John
Waters in action during their heyday.<br /><br />But I digress. Inez&#x27;s College flame pokes fun at Gil&#x27;s unconditional
love for nostalgia calling it &#x22;denial.&#x22; Nostalgia isn&#x27;t denial to me.
It&#x27;s more of a period appreciation complimented with a wish for it to
return and a subtle pessimism because one may think great, landmark
things won&#x27;t be able to be achieved in the present. We all know that is
untrue, but look at the eighties and all the political and pop culture
accomplishments and tell me they&#x27;re inferior to those of today. I
suppose if we&#x27;re talking the technological field they are, but it was
more simplistic and more basic. Everything is so difficult now almost
everywhere you look.<br /><br />This brings me to my next point. The film works as a form of escapism
for literary writers. Think of it this way; Gil is in love with the
period of the twenties in Paris and the idols that came out of it. He
probably dreamt up his own fantasies with Hemingway and others before
meeting them in person. When he finds them in real life, it&#x27;s his own
way of writer escapism. Some writers take more unhealthy practices such
as drinking and drug use, but Gil frolics with Ernest and F. Scott.
Maybe Woody Allen does in his dreams as well. Who wouldn&#x27;t want to hear
their idols&#x27; thoughts on their work in present day? As for the film
itself, the art direction and acting, especially from Wilson, is
effervescent, welcomed, and extraordinary. The opening sequence, which
clocks in at almost four and a half minutes, features beautiful music
and a slideshow of footage from Paris. It doesn&#x27;t feel like a postcard
as much as it does a scenic foreshadowing to the events we are about to
be blessed with. Owen Wilson has also proved that when given the proper
script and character he can be a marvelous and compelling character
actor.<br /><br />I fell in love with Midnight in Paris early on for its excellent
commentary on modernism vs. nostalgia factors. I became even more sold
when the film decided to become close to home for me when discussing
writing styles and escapism. Woody Allen has proved himself worthy of
the title &#x22;cinema genius&#x22; with this after a string of films critics and
audiences found mediocre to fair. Here, it is the direct opposite.
Critics were overjoyed and most audiences were astounded. Some people
need to just step out in the rain once in a while. Midnight in Paris is
the film that makes you.<br /><br />Starring: Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates,
Adrien Brody, Carla Bruni, and Michael Sheen. Directed by: Woody Allen.
