2011_August 6 
There are so many copycatting like ingredients tossed into the
scenarios and storyline, mixed up and dissolved into this Woody Allen&#x27;s
movie: &#x22;Cinderella&#x22; the cartoon, &#x22;Somewhere in Time&#x22;, &#x22;Time Traveler&#x27;s
Wife&#x22;, and so many other Sci-fi and romantic movies and novels. The 12
o&#x27;clock midnight charm is definitely from Cinderella, the big antique
car is like the chariot from a pumpkin; meeting a dream woman and
becoming so obsessed is just like what the male met his fatal female in
&#x22;somewhere in Time&#x22;, the only thing turns out better is the guy in
Midnight in Paris didn&#x27;t become a tragic character in the end but a
happy one instead.<br /><br />I often questioned the overly exaggeration of making Paris the most
romantic city in the world. Seems everything in Paris is exquisite and
sublime. This is obviously a scam manipulated by the international
tourism and the French. A city actually is no different from other
cities in any country, people live in it shitting, crapping, eating,
fornicating, urinating, sneezing, coughing....as any other city
dwellers doing daily. What&#x27;s the big deal? Walking in the rain falling
in Paris is more romantic than falling in other cities? Maybe just a
little better than the rain that falls in China, less acid and
pollution? The movie also would only resonant to those who know a
little bit of French and American literature, some basic common
knowledge of the art world, about Picasso, Dali, Manet. Without knowing
these fundamental French/American Literature For The Dummies and Art
History 101, I really doubt those majority video gamers would give a
rat arse about this movie. And I am quite sure that this movie is only
for the people who still read and not even the kind who really read on
Kindle.<br /><br />With all things considered and said, I have to say signing Owen Wilson
up to do this character was 50/50 good and bad at the same time. The
way he talks, the way he spit out the dialog is not quite likable, as
his mouth and lips often twisted in a weird way, and exactly sounds
like what his fianc&#xE9;e&#x27;s father said: &#x22;There&#x27;s part of his brain
missing&#x22;. He doesn&#x27;t look convincing and believable as a writer and
sometimes a bit immature, childish and lukewarm. There are many
characters played by other actors and actresses are very convincing,
but the character played by him, unfortunately, nobody but Owen Wilson,
with a funny nose and mouth.
