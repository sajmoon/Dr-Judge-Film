Midnight in Paris (2011) <br /><br />**** (out of 4)<br /><br />A writer (Owen Wilson) and his fianc&#xE9; (Rachel McAdams) travel to Paris
where his walk through the streets after midnight will eventually
change his life. After deciding to walk alone, the writer eventually
gets picked up and travels back to Paris in the 1920s and comes face to
face with such famous personalities as Ernest Hemingway, Zelda and
Scott Fitgerald, Cole Porter, Salvador Dali, Pablo Picasso and Luis
Bunuel among others. After these fantasy meetings the writer begins to
rethink his position in life and what he wants for his future. MIDNIGHT
IN Paris isn&#x27;t a masterpiece as there are quite a few flaws and it&#x27;s
certainly not higher level Woody Allen but there&#x27;s no denying that it&#x27;s
one of the most magical, charming and fun movies he&#x27;s ever made. The
film really is a mixture of MANHATTAN and PLAY IT AGAIN SAM, which
certainly isn&#x27;t a bad thing. Those who have seen MANHATTAN will
remember that the film started off with clips of the city and the same
thing happens here as the movie opens with various lovely shots of
Paris. The fantasy angle of the film is something we&#x27;ve seen from Allen
in movies like PLAY IT AGAIN SAM and even EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU had
a great fantasy sequence at the end. You can&#x27;t help but think Allen
must have had a field day writing the screenplay and I think the
results really show on the screen because there&#x27;s just a certain charm
and joy that bleeds in every scene and I honestly don&#x27;t remember a
single second where I didn&#x27;t have a big smile on my face. In an early
scene we get a dialogue bit where the characters talk about Wilson&#x27;s
character being in love with the past and how he thinks the &#x22;golden
age&#x22; was back in the 20s. I&#x27;m sure Allen fantasizes about this as well
and this comes across in the screenplay because when the fantasy aspect
kicks in and Wilson starts meeting all these famous people you can&#x27;t
help but fall in love with the scenery, the words and of course the
streets of Paris. People have been talking this up as a romantic comedy
and in many ways it is but at the same time you have to admire the way
Allen works the reality and the fantasy and you can&#x27;t help but think
that he was saying that quite often the fantasy is much better than any
reality you can put yourself in.<br /><br />Since Allen started taking major gaps in between his acting, there have
been quite a few people try and fill his shoes and the results are
always very hit and miss. Wilson perfectly nails this character because
you can believe that naive nature of the guy but he&#x27;s also relaxed
enough to where you can get into the story and follow it. The
screenplay bleeds with joy about meeting these famous people but Wilson
really sells it and that astonished look he gets on his face when he
meets these people helps sell the stories. Wilson is so great in the
role that you can&#x27;t help but wish he and Allen would do more films.
McAdams is as charming as ever and plays that &#x22;Allen female&#x22; just fine.
Adrien Brody is terrific as Salvador and Kathy Bates gets a good part
as Gertrude Stein. As great as everyone is, it&#x27;s Mario Cotillard who
steals the film as Adriana, a mistress to Modigliani and Picasso and
the one who really strikes it up with Wilson&#x27;s character. Cotillard is
so beautiful and her natural charm just leap off the screen and you
can&#x27;t help but fall in love with her as she&#x27;s certainly one of the
greatest characters in any recent Allen film. The chemistry between her
and Wilson is terrific and she really does look and feel like someone
from this era.<br /><br />I&#x27;m sure many people won&#x27;t understand all the characters and I&#x27;m sure
many people might watch MIDNIGHT IN Paris and be confused at who these
famous faces are. Let&#x27;s be real, in today&#x27;s world not everyone is going
to know these famous names and they&#x27;re going to miss many jokes.
There&#x27;s even a terrific and hilarious bit about Bunuel&#x27;s THE
EXTERMINATING ANGEL that is going to be missed by some viewers but if
you know the film then it&#x27;s going to be a classic example of writing
and comic timing. MIDNIGHT IN Paris clearly isn&#x27;t meant to be taking
overly serious since, after all, we&#x27;re dealing with a man living out a
fantasy in the 1920s Paris but Allen gives so much detail to his
characters that you can&#x27;t help but fall in love with them and the city.
It&#x27;s clearly a love letter to not only Paris but these wild characters
who Allen wanted to have some fun with.
