Woody Allen has lost it. This movie sucked big time. Made me want to
vomit. Lens cap still on camera. Why did they make this. I bet they
loose money. You have to be kidding. What a waste of time. I want my
money back. Music was the best part. Woody, what were you thinking?
What happened to the talent? I want refund for popcorn. Who&#x27;s idea was
this stinker. The costumes were really great. The acting was very
disappointing. Avoid this like the plague. There was no character
development. My hopes were let down. I expected a lot more. This actor
list should deliver. I usually love these guys. What made this film
fail. Must be terribly bad directing. The critics were very wrong. I
promised five word critiques. IMDb will probably delete this, Woody
would see the irony. He might even like this. Five word critiques are
hard. I want Woody to laugh. Sorry Woody, really bad film. I have
enjoyed your career. But this one&#x27;s a turkey. Write us another hit
movie. I know you have it. I hope IMDb prints this. Include these same
fine actors. Take the lens cap off. I must be leaving now. Better luck
with next movie. I could write for you. Maybe add Mike Mters too.
Anyway have a nice weekend. Start that new project now.
