Writer-director Woody Allen makes one of the best movies in his career,
after changing cinema with his award-winning motion pictures from
&#x22;Annie Hall&#x22; to &#x22;Hannah and Her Sisters&#x22;. Now, one of cinema&#x27;s smartest
directors has made a movie showing the beauty and grace of the city of
Paris, with an all-star cast including Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams,
Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates, Adrien Brody, Carla Bruni, and Michael
Sheen. The movie is set in the middle of Paris, where Wilson plays a
screenwriter on holiday, with a beautiful fianc&#xE9;e, distracted by the
magical experiences of the beautiful city. Until he discovers the true
magic of the city, every night at midnight, when he travels back in
time to the era of the 20s and discovers the magic beneath when he
meets his life-long artistic and literary heroes, and falls in love
with Marion Cotillard as Adriana. This movie also brings a heartwarming
message about if we had created a more brighter and creative society,
life would be much sweeter. Director Woody Allen has provided one of
his best movies to date. He has made such a well-written script with
comedy, charm, and charisma. The casting ensemble is something to die
for. Owen Wilson deserves total Oscar consideration for his excellent
performance, Rachel McAdams was just awesome, and Marion Cotillard was
just plain lovely. Every moment is plain laughable, from Wilson
discovering the 20s every midnight, to acting like a maniac when
talking about meeting famous icons from the past. Those moments are
handled in such a unique way, and those laughs are deserving. It was
safe to say that this movie wasn&#x27;t a sequel, remake, or reboot. But
it&#x27;s an original romantic comedy, and it&#x27;s truly entertaining and
excellent. This is a movie with a hilarious premise, an excellent cast,
and a smart director like Woody Allen. &#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; is by far
one of the best movies of 2011, or probably any other year. Woody Allen
deserves Oscar consideration for writing and directing this
masterpiece, and this will be a nominee for the Best Picture of 2011.
&#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22;, in my review, &#x22;a smart and unique romantic
masterpiece&#x22;.
