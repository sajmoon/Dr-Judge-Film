It&#x27;s a movie that romanticizes Paris&#x97;extolling all it&#x27;s magic and
beauty&#x97;while belying the theme we always over-romanticize the world
outside our realm.<br /><br />It&#x27;s immensely entertaining and like other Woody Allen films it&#x27;s not
necessarily laugh out loud funny as much as it&#x27;s quietly smirking to
oneself funny. <br /><br />Rachel McAdams sheds her perfect, big-eyed nice girl role to play a
vain, arrogant socialite while still being completely believable. Owen
Wilson, who has been a screenwriter, gives a nice balance between
young-boy-like-wonderment with a scared, always doubtful, realist. <br /><br />The world it creates in 1920&#x27;s Paris is amazing with beautiful sets,
costumes, lighting, cars, and many other nice touches to make us feel
like we&#x27;re there.<br /><br />See this movie because it&#x27;s overly romantic while still picking fun at
itself in the way only Woody Allen can.
