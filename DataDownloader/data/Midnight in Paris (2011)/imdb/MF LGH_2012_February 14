I really fail to see how this film can attract so many decent reviews.
I&#x27;m no film buff but I&#x27;ve seen a fair few in my time and this is
probably one of the worst. The scenes of Paris are more like a 1980s
ministry of tourism project - if you want to see sumptuous Paris then
look no further than Jean-Pierre Jeunet&#x27;s Amelie. The plot is absurd -
it&#x27;s like a school film project - hey why don&#x27;t we cram in as many
famous people from the past as we can and then have the main character
miraculously be able to go back in time whenever he wants! Even this
could be tolerated if it weren&#x27;t for all the cringeworthy lines such as
when the main character walks into a room to meet Gertrude Stein and
she leans over and says &#x22;hey Pablo what yer paintin&#x22; or something
equally painful in order to shoehorn in another famous character.
Wooden acting, appalling script, truly terrible stuff.
