&#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; has one fault that simply could not be fixed. The
lead character, Gil, is Woody Allen as we&#x27;ve seen him in decades past.
But he&#x27;s inhabiting Owen Wilson&#x27;s body, and Wilson has neither the
voice nor the mannerisms to fill Woody&#x27;s part. Otherwise, the film has
everything you could ask of a Woody film. That includes one of Woody&#x27;s
preoccupations: in this case Paris in the 1920s. There&#x27;s fine acting,
including Carla Bruni in a brief but important appearance as a museum
guide. There&#x27;s brilliant satire. The scene between Gil and Hemingway
simply nails Hemingway to the cross of contemporary criticism. The
scenes involving Gertrude Stein and Picasso are equally on target. And
in delicious irony, the beautiful young woman (Marion Cotillard) Gil
takes up with in 1920&#x27;s Paris joins him in a detour to La Belle Epoch
and wants to remain there because she&#x27;s so unexcited by the 1920s Paris
that Gil idolizes. Numerous famous names from the past have their turn
on the screen in lovely vignettes, and the Paris landscape is displayed
in enough photos to fill a tourist&#x27;s album many times over. Don&#x27;t miss
this one.
