My God! 8.0?!! An average score of 8.0??!!! I often wonder how poor
movies gain rave reviews. Yes, this is a very poor movie... with a good
cast. After 20 minutes waiting for the film to start, in came the
magical nonsense and the film bimbled around the 5/6 mark til it
finished, not quickly enough.<br /><br />I guess it was slightly redeemed by decent enough cinematography but it
would have taken a miracle for it to reach 8.0. I was expecting a good
movie and went to bed wishing I&#x27;d have seen one.<br /><br />I can only surmise that the first reviews of movies like this are
written by the film&#x27;s PR company or paid entourage and the remainder
blindly follow suit. If you want to see a good movie, skip this one.<br /><br />My 14 yo daughter went to bed after 15 minutes, bored senseless, yet we
sat it out expecting it to eventually dazzle. Next time we&#x27;re having an
earlier night.<br /><br />Miss this film and retain 2 hours of your life.
