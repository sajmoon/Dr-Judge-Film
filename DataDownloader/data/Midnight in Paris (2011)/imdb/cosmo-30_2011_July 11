This is Allen&#x27;s senile swan song. He has lost his muse and can no
longer write or direct. Wilson is tough to like in this role, and the
plot is a meandering slog of sentimental fantasy, a simple message,
mediocre photography, boring script, sans ending. There is a cheap shot
at the Tea Party and Allen has to be boorish with his worm&#x27;s eye view
of a conservative who is cast in a typical liberal, stereotypical
manner. I nearly fell asleep at this movie, did not like any
characters, especially all of them, loathed the stupid story and dead
loose ends. Wilson shows no emotion, just his usual whiny, nasal drone
you hear in every movie he makes. What a waste of time and film.
