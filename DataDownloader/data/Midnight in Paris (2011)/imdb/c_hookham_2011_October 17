A frustrated American writer (Owen Wilson playing a role Allen would
have played himself 30 years ago)on his hols in Paris with his
obnoxious, materialistic fianc&#xE9; finds his midnight strolls turning into
time travel back to Paris&#x27; golden years of the 1920s and the 1880s and
along the way meets all manner of artistic and literary greats from
Paris&#x27; past such as Dali, Scott-Fitzgerald, Hemingway,Metisse etc and
in the doing so realises that the past isn&#x27;t as important as now. Both
Wilson and Marion Cotillard shine in their roles as does Michael Sheen
as a pedantic and ultimately sleazy friend of Wilson&#x27;s fianc&#xE9;. With
great acting and beautifully filmed its a wonderful postcard of Paris
now and in the past... 8/10
