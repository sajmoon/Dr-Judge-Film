Maybe because it is one of the most recent narrative creating devices,
cinema is probably the most powerful we&#x27;ve ever invented. Certainly the
one that still flashes in people&#x27;s minds more easily these days. We
know storytelling is probably as old as language, and language in our
very peculiar human sense is as old as Humans themselves. Some
filmmakers, out of the blue, constantly remind us how still little
explored are the narrative power of cinema as a medium. M&#xE9;li&#xE8;s, Welles,
Kurosawa, Hitchcock, Kar Wai, Park, Tarkovsky and a handful of others,
each gave us invaluable break-throughs, new ways to tell things, new
forms to feel. But few have questions the limits of narrative as the
structured soul of a film as Woody. Many accuse him of repeating
himself. Always the same pseudo-intellectual characters, babbling empty
people with trifle lives, nothing serious to say or do. Broken
marriages, adultery, and so on. That&#x27;s all true because those are the
superficial elements on which Woody builds most of his films. But in
everyone of them, he tries something he hasn&#x27;t tried before, sometimes
repeating some other filmmakers experiences, other times trying stuff
no one has ever tried before. He misses some chances, he hits a few
more, but i know he always tries. And for that reason i&#x27;ll always want
to see his films, made or to be made. <br /><br />Here he makes something that superficially resembles his celebrated
Purple Rose of Cairo. But this is quite a different breed. What he
tries is a highly complex experience in parallel inter-related worlds.
Parallel realities where where (or when!) what happens in one, affects
the other. The film begins in a recognizable present, establishes
itself on other fantasy level, and finds its resolution in yet another
deeper layer. Each layer is nested on the previous one, all of them
rooted in Paris, and its clich&#xE9;s for each moment. Same space, same
character, different dynamics of it. A solid triangular structure,
where the same typical Allen elements find a new place to breath. <br /><br />In the way we find Marion Cotillard, whom we have seen in Inception, a
similarly structured film about finding realities buried deep in the
previous level, there mapped into dreams, and who knows, maybe here
this is all mapped into the dreams of Owen&#x27;s character. Inception also
rooted the whole thing in Paris, one of the most filmed places ever,
and one of those whose clich&#xE9;s are more built by films. And there also,
Marion was the invented subconscious lover, who&#x27;s very existence as a
character was questionable.<br /><br />By now, its a perfectly assumed and natural thing that every film is in
one way or another a blink of eye to the audiences via the reference to
other films or to cinema in general. The french new wavers introduced
that in film vocabulary as a common practice, so natural that you
almost can&#x27;t live without it today. Woody starts here with a character
who Is a film writer trying to move into literature fiction. He goes to
Paris, he gives us an initial montage of Paris and its recognizable
places, less vigorous but much in the way of the initial sequence in
Manhattan. And he places his layers, his &#x22;golden ages&#x22; in similarly
cinematic moments in time. The intellectuals and artist celebrities are
there more than anything to color the human landscape, although the
joke on Bu&#xF1;uel&#x27;s film is great.<br /><br />If you need to find another self-referential &#x22;meaning&#x22; to all this,
than i suppose woody himself observes his new-york high empty class of
intellectuals and sees it as he puts Sheen&#x27;s character here: full of
words but ultimately empty, boring, and utterly uninteresting. It&#x27;s as
if he had lived all his life trying to move up (or down) to his
personal golden age, he the nostalgic for the new orleans big bands
(which he uses in the initial soundtrack). You can go there and explore
it like that. I like to contemplate the structure.<br /><br />Among the people i went to see this with, there was some discussion
about why the main poster would reference Van Gogh without him even
showing up in the film. I would say, maybe in a superficial way, that
Van Gogh had similar aspirations to most of his paintings than Woody
had for this film: painting what he saw, and layering on it a distorted
vision of it, many times tormented, but always rooted in some
inexistent world. In doing so he gave us transcendental figurative art
(in his case fueled by absinthe and his own madness). Colors were
Vincent&#x27;s narrative tools. Narrative structure itself is Woody&#x27;s very
fabric for his films.<br /><br />My opinion: 3/5 another tile in woody&#x27;s mosaic. What&#x27;s next?
