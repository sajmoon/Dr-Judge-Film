Where has he been - Woody Allen? I thought he&#x27;d retired but I would
just like to think he was having a rest before bringing out this gem of
a movie and it is a gem. Well up there and surpassing Annie Hall The
main protagonist Gil (Owen Wilson) plays his role superbly (as well as
the great cast that Woody Allen always seems to find and take from
roles you had normally seen them in to roles you would never imagine
they could perform)- he essentially has come to Paris with his fianc&#xE9;
and her parents who are as materialistic about life as well as being
insincere. Gil wants inspiration to write a book and his fianc&#xE9; just
wants to buy half of France! But at Midnight in Paris Gil is
transported back in time to meet all his idols writers and musicians
and painters and he re thinks his book and re thinks his life as a
consequence. As the story develops nicely before our eyes we see how he
struggles with his present relationship and the one he imagines in the
past. The film has everything humour, poignant moments and above all is
thought provoking. Simply Woody Allen at his best a possible Oscar
Candidate and a Tapestry of brilliance.
