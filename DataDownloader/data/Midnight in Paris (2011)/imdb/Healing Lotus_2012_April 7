The film transported the mind and heart to Paris, mesmerizing the movie
viewer to feel its beauty, for all whom have been blessed to see the
city, it was a realistic portrayal of its eternal charm.<br /><br />A memorable Woody Allen film which captivated its viewer to immerse
oneself in the moment of the artists world of era&#x27;s gone by and
illuminated us with a juxtaposition of the present reality.<br /><br />The scenery, french time-period sets, color, artistic textures,
lighting, costumes, music, script, editing and acting within &#x27;Midnight
in Paris&#x27; were richly luscious and encapsulating due to vivid attention
to fine detail. <br /><br />Wilson expressed an ability to draw the movie viewer into the
enchantment of a love story, that was written to open the heart towards
fullness.&#x27;Midnight in Paris&#x27; creates a strength for the inner voice
that calls us to our destiny in each moment, to seek a relationship
based on the truth of compatibilism.
