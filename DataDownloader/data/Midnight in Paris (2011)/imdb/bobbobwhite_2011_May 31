Woody has a way of making romantic comedies so attractive in person and
in location that you always want to be there too. I would bet that
tourism to Paris increases this summer due to this film. And, Paris
never looked lovelier, as the first 3 minutes of the film was a running
postcard of still-shots of Paris&#x27; greatest and most beautiful sights.
Just an inspired leadoff for a film full of great shots.<br /><br />The idea was that the Woody character, this time the well-rumpled Owen
Wilson as Gil, a frustrated novelist and Hollywood screenwriter, was
half of an engaged couple who, along with his fianc&#xE9; Inez&#x27; elitist
parents, visit Paris. For many good reasons, he opts out of doing the
sights with her parents and ends up going walking alone at midnight.
He, as in a fantasy, meets a strange classic limo that stops, people
inside beckon for him to get in, which he does, and he is instantly
transported back to the Paris of the 20&#x27;s, the era in which he always
longed to live. He does this same midnight escapade again and again,
and in time he wondrously meets all of the famous Paris artists of that
day. These fantastic adventures determined the course of the story,
which also included Michael Sheen as an arrogant, pedantic college
professor friend of his fianc&#xE9; that Woody, I mean Owen as Gil,
detested. His fianc&#xE9;? Far from it, as you will see. And, Adrien Brody
was hilarious as Salvador Dali, as in &#x22;Dali!!!&#x22; and &#x22;Rhinocerous!&#x22; That
part was priceless.<br /><br />Gil as Woody(let&#x27;s just use Woody OK?)met a couple of gorgeous women
interested in a romance with him, one of them being the terminally cute
Marion Cotillard(Adriana)on his visits to the 20&#x27;s, and a sweet antique
dealer in the present time. After finally resolving his life&#x27;s troubles
caused by his fianc&#xE9; and by his many trips to his fantasy 20&#x27;s world,
Woody ended up as he should have with the right partner and the right
life&#x27;s direction, and apparently is still in Paris living happily ever
after. <br /><br />Ah, if it all could be so grand and ending just as it should, as it
always does in Woody&#x27;s fantasies.
