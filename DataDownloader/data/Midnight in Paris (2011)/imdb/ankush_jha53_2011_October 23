It begins with still shots of beloved city with which no art, no matter
how great, can be compared. In this surreal fantasy it seems Woody
Allen has traveled back to his golden age, the 70s. When he gave the
world the likes of Annie hall and Manhattan. It keeps hooked with
typical quirky characters and unusual observations and conversations.
We meet people from the golden age. witness an affair in the Paris of
20s. Settings of the movie can not be critiqued. The cinematography
only enhances, if it&#x27;s possible, the beauty of sets. Wilson does the
character as woody Allen would do it. He keep putting his hands in the
pocket, walks funny, delivers quirky dialogs. This movie itself is
Woody Allen, conversations about fear of death, empty existence,
hopeless love and Paris - all have for so long characterized him and
his early movies. So glad to see he finally made a movie in our time as
great as the ones he used to make. A thing that he leaves with us in
this film - &#x22;We all fear death and question our place in universe. The
artist&#x27;s job is not to succumb to despair but to find an antidote for
the emptiness of existence.&#x22;
