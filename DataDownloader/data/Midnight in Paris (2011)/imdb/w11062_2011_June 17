Midnight in Paris is a beautiful looking movie. The scenes in Paris are
great. Marion Cotillard is beautiful. Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams
are bland. The characters from the 1920&#x27;s (Earnest Hemingway, F Scott
and Zelda Fitzgerald, Pablo Picasso, and Salvator Dali) could have been
more interesting. It could have been more funnier. The ending was good.
It was well paced. Not too long. Midnight in Paris is a beautiful
