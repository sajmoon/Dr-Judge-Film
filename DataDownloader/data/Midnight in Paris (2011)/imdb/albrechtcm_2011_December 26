Mr. Allen had me at &#xAB; Paris &#xBB;. What a wonderful tour of this beautiful
city, and the revived color of the Roaring Twenties and the Belle
Epoque. The premise was great (for people like me, who are people like
Gil in the movie). How many times have we dreamers envisioned ourselves
living in a garret, lolling for hours in some little bistro while we
sipped a glass of wine or a caf&#xE9; allong&#xE9;. Like Gil, every time I get to
Paris, I wear myself out wandering little side streets and stopping at
out-of-the way bistros and brasseries to rest while I sit and absorb
atmosphere. Unfortunately, in my little randonn&#xE9;es I never managed to
step through that magical curtain into the past. Much as I enjoyed the
film, the story line and color, I do feel that the whole structure was
somewhat contrived. Boy, this guy got a chance to visit with just about
every artist, painter, writer, filmmaker available as well as their
copines, throwing in a glimpse of Josephine Baker to boot. He even went
farther into the past for a visit to the Moulin Rouge. Throwing aside
any relationship to reality, this was an absorbing and fun movie to
watch. The soprano (I think) sax was sublime.
