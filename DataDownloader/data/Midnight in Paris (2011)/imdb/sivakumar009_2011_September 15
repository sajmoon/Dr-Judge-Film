The best ever movie about Paris and the full credit should be given to
director &#x26; script he chose. These are the same feelings many people &#x26;
in particular I have such as how it would be to travel to past and see
the Golden Era for yourself. I have to say that the director&#x27;s idea
about Golden Age is very astonishing and the whole crew is brilliant in
acting. Although, Adriana character steals the show. Photography is
perfectly fitting like and Art department did an excellent job in the
portrayal of the Past. Hats off to the Director and his vivid
imagination. Everyone who likes to feel the past should watch the
movie.
