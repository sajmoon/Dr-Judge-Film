Midnight in Paris<br /><br />Until now, the most mysterious aspect of midnight in Paris was that it
was 3 pm in Los Angeles.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this comedy offers an alternative abnormality associated
with the witching hour.<br /><br />When Gil (Owen Wilson), a scriptwriter from LA, vacations in Pairs with
his fianc&#xE9;e (Rachel McAdams) and her parents, his longing for a bygone
era is sated when he&#x27;s transported to the 1920s, where his idols F.
Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway edify him on the craft of
writing, while Picasso&#x27;s muse (Marion Cotillard) beguiles him with
beauty.<br /><br />Meanwhile, his soon-to-be in-laws hire a private detective to follow
Gil on his nightly constitutionals.<br /><br />Conceived by Woody Allan, Midnight in Paris is an amusing and
unconventional love letter to The City of Light told by means of a
neurotic time-traveller.<br /><br />But as a writer, shouldn&#x27;t you be travelling forward in time to
plagiarize successful work that hasn&#x27;t been published yet? (Green
Light)<br /><br />vidiotreviews.blogspot.com
