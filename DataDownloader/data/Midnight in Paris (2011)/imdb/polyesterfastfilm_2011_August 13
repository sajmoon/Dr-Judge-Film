Woody Allen can utilize his satire to be original, his romantic comedy
to stimulate, and his drama to make a point. Midnight in Paris is
shaped by his vision of a Bergman style drama. His obsession with
Bergman extends to his movies where he cracks jokes about his love for
the Swedes. In Bananas (1971), Woody Allen becomes President of San
Marcos and declares that the official language be Swedish. This is no
doubt an homage to Ingmar Bergman, a writer/director who has more
influence on Woody Allen&#x27;s film career than anyone. This style is
formed around tortured characters who live out their internal struggle
by reliving past and fictional memories. When I saw that Rachel McAdams
hair is blonde in Midnight in Paris, I thought, with a smirk on my
face, &#x22;Ingrid Thulin.&#x22;<br /><br />Woody Allen&#x27;s 41st movie is Midnight in Paris (2011). It&#x27;s aroma is of
The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985) mixed with hints of Deconstructing
Harry (1997). The Purple Rose of Cairo comparison comes from the want
of a character to be in another time. This template usually starts by
defining two realities, which we will separate into the crushing
reality of existence and the illusions. <br /><br />The crushing reality comes in contact with the illusions, be it the
allure of stars of film characters in classic cinema (The Purple Rose
of Cairo) or the nostalgia of 1920&#x27;s Paris in the rain and the artists
and writers of the Jazz Age (Midnight in Paris). The characters are
faced with a decision to reject or accept the illusions, the driving
catalyst which propels the story forward.<br /><br />The illusions are fantasy, this fiction life where wish fulfillment is
the norm. The main characters struggle with illusions of romance, no
doubt delusions. With these delusions, Woody Allen gives a nod to such
Bergman films as Through a Glass Darkly (1961) and Cries and Whispers
(1972).<br /><br />The Deconstructing Harry comparison is the storyline of the writer who
has fictional characters to haunt him. Harry Block remembers scenes
from his book as well as his past. In Midnight in Paris, it is a
fantasy for a different life which draws Gil to the streets of Paris.
In Bergman&#x27;s Wild Strawberries (1957), Dr. Isak Borg is visited by a
flood of illusions on his way to receive an honorary degree. Bergman
beautifully displays the hidden places in Borg&#x27;s mind. Woody Allen
shows us his own version of Wild Strawberries, as the visit to Paris
takes us into the fantasies of Gil&#x27;s mind.
