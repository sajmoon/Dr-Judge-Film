2011_September 5 
As crazy as it may be, this is the first Allen film I have ever seen,
and after watching this, I am definitely going to watch all of his
others. This kind of film makes me wonder how we can be happy with rom
coms where we know the films entire plot from the advert. I was
completely caught by surprise at the romantic, clever, intriguing,
funny, interesting and thoroughly well written script. I had no idea
about the plot and was happily led by Wilson&#x27;s character into the
depths of Paris&#x27; magical midnight strike. Other actor&#x27;s involved did a
great job too. I was particularly impressed with McAdams as it just
adds to her ability to play any role. I think overall I&#x27;m simply in awe
at the film. It&#x27;s a classic. A really refreshing idea, gently portrayed
in an almost realistic way, like this French magic really does exist.
The music and scenery adds to the charm of the film and the subtle
humour is a nice touch too. I would definitely recommend this to anyone
and will watch this over and over again for years to come. Along with
Manhattan, Match Point, Annie Hall....
