&#x22;And actually, Paris is the most beautiful in the rain.&#x22;<br /><br />Probably the most charming and fanciful Woody Allen movies that I&#x27;ve
seen, and also one of the most enjoyable. Owen Wilson is great as a
proxy Allen, transported back to the streets of 1920&#x27;s Paris and
looking for his &#x22;Golden Age&#x22; amongst the famous writers and artists
that wafted through the city at that time.&#xA0;<br /><br />I really don&#x27;t have any criticisms about the movie. The script is
trademark Woody Allen, full of musings about life and happiness, but
it&#x27;s more subtle and natural than his dialogue can often be. The cast
is great (Corey Stoll as Earnest Hemingway and Adrien Brody as
Salavador Dali being two of the most memorable examples), and Paris
looks so beautiful that it often can distract from what&#x27;s going on with
the characters.&#xA0;<br /><br />Fully recommended for Woody fans, Wilson fans, romantics at heart, and
those who love Paris (both past and present).&#xA0;
