I just loved this movie. The premise was truly interesting and kept me
wanting to see more and more. The characters were likable except for
the fianc&#xE9; and parents, but were selected appropriately for the roles.
You must enjoy the wordiness of Mr. Allen and the tongue-in-cheek
comedy. Pure magic from beginning to end. What a pleasure to see a good
movie. You are taken by surprise and taken back in time to a happy and
giddy time when people laughed and danced. I have been a Woody Allen
fan for a long time and especially liked Vicki Christina Barcelona, so
I knew I would like this as well. This man has a fanciful mind and
seems never to be at a loss for words. If you like Woody Allen, you
must see this movie.
