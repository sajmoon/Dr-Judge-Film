Midnight in Paris isn&#x27;t an exciting movie, but entertains. Quite well,
actually. For an hour and a half, we see the main character, played by
Owen Wilson, enter a different world and realizing that that world
might be better than his own reality. And that, of course, could only
happen in Paris. It&#x27;s an easy movie to watch, it doesn&#x27;t makes us think
too much; it makes us dream, just like the protagonist. Wilson isn&#x27;t a
sublime actor but gives us an easily likable character. A simple
writer, he feels he was born at the wrong time and only wants the
opportunity to live in another age. We can find some similarities with
the seventies&#x27; Woody Allen... the way he walks, talks, the gestures...
Maybe Allen intended that, by casting Wilson. Rachel McAdams plays his
wife; arrogant, shallow, a bit naive, who isn&#x27;t able to picture a a
life beyond the one she knows. Michael Sheen plays McAdams ex-teacher,
and it is when the couple crosses paths with Sheen&#x27;s character that the
incompatibilities between them become absolutely evident. But it&#x27;s in
the &#x27;parallel&#x27; world of Wilson that we find the real interesting
characters, with simple but effective performances by established
actors, from Marion Cotillard to Kathy Bates, and 5 minutes of pure
gold with Adrien Brody, as Dal&#xED;; and also good performances by less
known actors such Corey Stoll or Allison Pill. Don&#x27;t forget to check
Carla Bruni&#x27;s appearance, in a simple but charming role, that fits her
quite well.<br /><br />Far from Allen&#x27;s golden era, Midnight in Paris still scores by being
different and original, which is something we can&#x27;t always say about
his movies. A picture with beautiful images and a plot capable of
keeping us minimally interested for an hour and a half, but that does
not go any further.<br /><br />6/10
