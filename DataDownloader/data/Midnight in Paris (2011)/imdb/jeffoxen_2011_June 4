no one word of truth, but watching is pleasure. the real Paris is a
dirty,sleazy,crime ridden,dangerous city. but what we need is a fairy
story ,which reduce our negative emotion from our realities,that&#x27;s what
woody provide,that is his business. The actors performances are fine,
nothing outstanding though, except for Adrien Brody probably. Owen
Wilson does a very good job but he tries too much to be and act like
Woody Allen. The impersonations are all great -Hemingway,Picasso,
repeat every bio book point by point,nice money maker.<br /><br />but this is a film that will surely not disappoint any woman but simple
as stone.
