Just an absolutely lovely film, definitely one of the best I&#x27;ve seen
all year. I can picture Woody Allen sitting at a caf&#xE9; in Paris staring
out into the streets letting his imagination wander freely and write
the story for him. <br /><br />I&#x27;m an artist so i have a sweet spot for this film and perhaps gave an
extra star for that reason, but that aside it&#x27;s a beautifully shot film
that has a good simple story, and believable characters in a fantastic
setting. One minus would be Rachel McAdams, who played opposite Owen
Wilson, she was too 2-dimesional. She just played uptight and annoyed
(which she happens to do pretty well) for the whole movie. I didn&#x27;t
quite understand how the two characters could have ever become engaged.
Otherwise the film is pretty stellar. The rest of the cast is mostly
brilliant. Owen Wilson is always Owen Wilson so if you are okay with
that he does a fine job. As always Marion Cotillard is blissfully good.<br /><br />The film is incredibly sweet and romantic and funny without being
corny; i absolutely loved it!
