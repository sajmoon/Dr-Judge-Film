Wow. Easily the second best film behind Drive for me. Woody Allen seems
to have taken pieces from &#x27;Purple Rose&#x27; and &#x27;Bullets of Broadway&#x27; to
create one of his greatest efforts (although I have yet to see Annie
Hall). The writing is great and as of now I hope for Allen to win best
screenplay. &#x27;Midnight&#x27; follows the Woody-Allen-esque character Gil
Pender and his fianc&#xE9;&#x27;s family on their trip to Paris. Right away we
can see Pender is a person who enjoys the very romantic things in life
and is in no way materialistic. Late one night he is brought into the
world of the 1920&#x27;s which he dreams about day in and day out. Soon, to
his surprise and sheer joy, Gil ends up meeting all the famous authors
and painters of the time. Allen cleverly brings everything together in
the end and provides plenty of laughs along the way. The one thing that
truly hit home with me is that a majority of people wish to live in the
past or aspire to live in a time that has been long gone. We dream
about it being better than the present because we are bored in the time
period we&#x27;re in, but as Gil says, &#x22;That&#x27;s what the present is. It&#x27;s a
little unsatisfying because life is unsatisfying.&#x22; This movie already
sticks with me because I don&#x27;t think I &#x27;ve ever connected with a main
character more than Gil Pender.
