I&#x27;m a big Woody Allen fan... so my review may seem biased.<br /><br />But you have to agree the movie has good new concept, and the
characters performed by an amazing string of brilliant actors. It is
funny, entertaining and delightful. It keeps you guessing - the reasons
for the occurrence of certain events, until the truth is revealed. I
don&#x27;t know why, but the movie makes you fall in love with Paris even
more (If you don&#x27;t love it yet, sorry, you have no taste). It&#x27;s an
endearing and thought provoking film that will whisk you away into a
sublime magical world. It&#x27;s certainly one of Woody Allen&#x27;s better films
in the recent years...
