The problem with this movie was that if they chose anyone (and by
anyone, I mean any actor that can be taken seriously and is not a
humongous goof ball) then it could have been magical. As it is, Mr.
Wilson played so many ridiculous parts that I can&#x27;t persuade myself
that he can act. Everything else about the movie was magical and
special, but the miss casting of the male lead ruined the enjoyment for
me. I would have given it a 1 if it weren&#x27;t for Marion Cotillard who
was an absolute pleasure to watch. The utter grace with which that
woman acts just leaves me speechless every time. She was the only thing
that saved this movie from total disgrace. (And to be fair,Corey Stoll
as Ernest Hemingway was an absolute pleasure as well).
