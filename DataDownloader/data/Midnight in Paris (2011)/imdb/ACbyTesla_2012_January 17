I just don&#x27;t get how anyone can really like Woody Allen pictures. They
are almost ALL universally Booooring!!! <br /><br />And while I like the romantic concept of this movie, the only thing
romantic in this movie is Paris. Which is spectacular... But that&#x27;s all
this movie has going for it. <br /><br />The concept of this script is interesting, but the characters come off
dull, weak and boorish. And I like Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, and
Marion Cotillard, whom I fell in love with in Ridley Scott&#x27;s &#x22;The Good
Year&#x22;. <br /><br />But not in this movie. Only Woody Allen could direct Owen Wilson and
turn him into a weak pathetic version of himself..in other words...he
turned Owen into Woody Allen.<br /><br />BTW, I just noticed that Marion Cotillard doesn&#x27;t appear prominently in
the IMDb credits of either movie and yet she is prominent in this
movie(maybe the only actor who stands out) or the &#x22;The Good Year&#x22; where
she plays the female lead. Is is it because she is French?
Curious....hmmmmmmm.<br /><br />I&#x27;ve never met a man with any testosterone that liked Woody Allen, I&#x27;m
thrilled that I haven&#x27;t had to go to a movie with him in it for a long
time...something I&#x27;ve had to do for girlfriends and wives....whom he
seems to have universal appeal. Go figure. <br /><br />If you like Woody Allen movies, you might like this movie....but if you
don&#x27;t...I&#x27;m pretty confident you won&#x27;t like this movie either.
