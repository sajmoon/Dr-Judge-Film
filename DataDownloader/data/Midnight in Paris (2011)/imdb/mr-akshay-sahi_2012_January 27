I am really not sure why people loved this movie. I thought it was so
predictable in terms of plot and had awful acting. I didn&#x27;t buy Owen
Wilson in this role nor did I think Rachel McAdams was good at all, who
I usually love.<br /><br />Similarly, I&#x27;ve been a Woody Allen fan in the past but this one was a
big let down.<br /><br />The portrayals of famous writers/artists was so ridiculously bad and
overdone; it was like an extreme caricature rather than good acting. I
kept thinking are they purposely over-acting here?! <br /><br />Watching this was a waste of 2 hours!
