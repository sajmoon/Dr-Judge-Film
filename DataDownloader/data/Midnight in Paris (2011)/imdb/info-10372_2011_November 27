I actually found this boring...and expected more. I thought there were
some nice quiet observational of human nature..but was bored by the
casting of rachel McAdams etc. It looked like a role right for Scarlett
Johansson.I like owen Wilson..but he didn&#x27;t hold my attenton for this.
It was the movie that could have and shoulda but..! for me it was a
lead casting thing. Bring in the heavyweights please.Even an older cast
would have worked too!but of course the studios would never allow
that.Lovely film but...the story was contrived at parts,though there
was a gem of a good idea in there.For me,not woody allens best work.but
a couple of nice observations into human character traits and flaws in
parts towards the end.
