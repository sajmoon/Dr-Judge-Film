I know negative reviews usually get the &#x27;thumbs down&#x27; on IMDb and I
understand that.<br /><br />However, how this movie got an overall score of 8.1 is beyond me.
Unless you are a literary aficionado who takes great pleasure in 20th
century stories and their authors, you will find no joy in this film.<br /><br />The main plot consists of a script writer attempting to get his book
approved by famous authors who lived many years ago. If you, like me,
take no joy in seeing F. Scott Fitzgerald amongst others portrayed on
screen, I&#x27;d skip. <br /><br />The pace is slow and repetitive (he goes back in time every midnight at
the same place, the only question is &#x27;what will he do tonight?&#x27;. He
doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot if you&#x27;re wondering.)<br /><br />The relationship between Owen Wilson&#x27;s character and that of Rachel
McAdam&#x27;s is strained and watered-down to fit the short amount of time
in the film that Wilson is in present day.<br /><br />Audience reaction: There were about 20 people in the theatre. There
were several boos, not at the end of the film, but during the film
itself! While audiences talking is usually frowned upon, several
couples were chatting and nobody, including myself, seemed to care
because their conversations were far more entertaining than the film
anyway. <br /><br />Approach with an open and knowledgeable mind.
