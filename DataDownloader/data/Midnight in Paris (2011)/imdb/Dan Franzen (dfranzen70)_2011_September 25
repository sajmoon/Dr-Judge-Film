Of all the Woody Allen movies in all the art-house theaters in the
world, this one is one of his truest, most engaging, most satisfying,
and most existential. It&#x27;s a gigantic treat to lovers of literature
everywhere, but even if you don&#x27;t know Toulouse-Lautrec from 2Pac, you
should truly love either the tantalizing romantic angles or the
mystery/fantasy underlying them all.<br /><br />Allen is getting too old to be playing himself in these movies, so the
task falls to Owen Wilson (who doesn&#x27;t have to change anything to do an
Allen impression). Wilson plays Gil, a Hollywood writer engaged to Inez
(Rachel McAdams), and they&#x27;re tagging along with Inez&#x27;s parents on
their vacation to Paris. But while Inez is enamored with pretty, shiny
objects and appearances, Gil instantly falls in love with the soul of
Paris and wants nothing more than to wander its streets, particularly
at night, to soak in its ambiance and perhaps get inspired to work on
his burgeoning first novel. After all, such literary greats as
Hemingway, Eliot, Fitzgerald, and Stein roamed those very streets;
perhaps what they saw will help Gil.<br /><br />Now, the following is not a spoiler in least. A quick look at the list
of characters should indicate a change in venue for Gil. One evening, a
little drunk from a wine tasting, Gil sits on a church&#x27;s steps; as the
clock chimes midnight, an old car pulls up, exhorting him to come with
them. Where? Why to the Fitzgeralds&#x27; of course. This leads Gil down
quite the path of self-examination and inspiration.<br /><br />Along the way, Gil meets many of his literary heroes and discovers a
little bit about what makes them tick. He&#x27;s even able to make return
visits by going to the same place at the same time. Of course, Inez
doesn&#x27;t believe him and is increasingly concerned with buying antique
furniture with her bossy, snobby mother. The chasm between man and
almost-wife widens.<br /><br />There are several reasons to recommend this movie. As usual, Allen&#x27;s
handpicked cast is up to its tasks. Some of these actors are known
quantities to many people, but some are not; either way, they imbue
their own characters with such a sense of reality that it&#x27;s easy to
imagine that actor truly is that icon. They deal not in caricatures but
in realizations.<br /><br />Another huge plus is the way that the storyline is set up. On the one
hand, you have the conflict between Inez and Gil, and on another you
have his cathartic moments with his literary heroes. Along the way, Gil
meets the Portugese Adriana (Marion Cotillard), a beauty who has
inspired famous painters and who is in love with an earlier time &#x96; just
as Gil is infatuated with his own earlier time. The moral that ties
these two worlds and their inhabitants together is a simple one, and
Allen delivers it with subtle grace and beauty.<br /><br />I have never been to Paris, a faraway land to me. But look at what
Allen has done with the way the movie is shot. Paris is idyllic in the
daytime, a combination of markets and boutiques, air-conditioned
restaurants and street caf&#xE9;s. At night, the city comes alive, even in
the rain; the movie is shot with such unerring detail and each raindrop
seems a work of art symbolizing Gil&#x27;s various quandaries.<br /><br />I think that Midnight in Paris is one of Allen&#x27;s finest over the past
20 years, perhaps one of his best ever, and certainly I&#x27;m not saying so
idly. The man has a long track record of delightful, funny comedies and
romances. He knows his audience well. But here, I think he surpassed
some expectations; his recent spate of Euro-centric movies (like Vicky
Cristina Barcelona and Match Point) were fairly well received by most
critics (ahem, not this one), but Midnight in Paris far exceeds them
both &#x96; as well as just about anything Allen&#x27;s done going back to the
mid-1990s. It is a superlative film that&#x27;s rich in texture, meaning,
and elegance, and its ending is a little surprising but certainly
plausible &#x96; the perfect ending.
