2012_January 9 
I am a Woody Allen fan and yet I must be the lone monotone in the
chorus of praise here. The gorgeous opening cinematic montage of
Parisian scenes, accompanied by what I have to believe is Woody himself
on clarinet in the musical accompaniment, leads us to believe we are in
for a Gallic &#x22;Manhattan.&#x22; But this movie is several steps down from
Woody&#x27;s brilliant love letter to New York. That movie had a credible
and engaging - if morally questionable - plot, about a middle age man
dating a high school girl (little did we know at the time&#x85;). But the
story here, aside from its fantastic elements, is thin and without
dramatic direction. Once the initial time travel back to the Paris of
the 20&#x27;s happens, there is very little else of consequence. And the
film has to be completely meaningless to anyone without a solid
historical knowledge of the intellectual scene in Paris in the Roaring
20&#x27;s. As a matter of fact it doesn&#x27;t take long before the film becomes
a pretentious exercise in name-dropping that actually becomes annoying.
Gee let&#x27;s see if we can name the next writer/artist/playwright/musician
that&#x27;s going to walk in the door. And Allen&#x27;s political beliefs, which,
if they were touched on at all in previous movies, were treated with
subtle whimsy, are here wielded like a two-by-four. And I find Owen
Wilson completely unsuited for the role of Allen&#x27;s alter ego. He just
doesn&#x27;t have the feel for the Allen persona, and I&#x27;m sorry, but he
should get that broken nose fixed as all it does is distract. <br /><br />I was vastly disappointed, and am at a loss to explain the rave reviews
this movie has received.
