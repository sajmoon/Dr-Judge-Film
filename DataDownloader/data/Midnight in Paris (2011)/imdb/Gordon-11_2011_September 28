This film is about an American writer who travels to Paris with his
fianc&#xE9;e. A chance encounter at midnight brings him back to the Paris in
the 1920&#x27;s.<br /><br />&#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; is very unlike a Woody Allen film, as it lacks the
non stop witty dialogs and sarcasm that are normally his trademarks.
Still, &#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; is highly intellectual and enjoyable. The
way it entertainingly weaves through so many artistic masterminds in a
story is quite genius. It gives me the impulse to go and study art
history! The cast is magnetic; Owen Wilson breathes life into this
confused man, while Adrien Brody is particularly memorable as Salvador
Dali. Even Carla Bruni is in the film, which is almost a official
recognition by the French that &#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; is a great film.<br /><br />&#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; might be the most commercial film Woody Allen has
made in years. It is a fun, and heartwarming fantasy tale. I am glad
that this has translated to box office success.
