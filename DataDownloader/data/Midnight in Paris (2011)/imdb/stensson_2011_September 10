In Woody Allen&#x27;s latest, you meet this Hollywood script writer visiting
Paris with his girlfriend and her vulgar conservative parents. None of
them really like the town, but the script writer keeps his nostalgic
dream about the city in the 20s.<br /><br />And suddenly, by midnight, he is invited to the world of his dreams,
there he meets Hemingway, Cole Porter, T S Eliot, Gertrude Stein,
Picasso, just for a start. He also meets this girl, who instead of the
20s she&#x27;s a part of, dreams of &#x22;La Belle Epoque&#x22;.<br /><br />So what is nostalgia? A pleasant way of refusing to accept your own
time and in the long run, your own life? That&#x27;s the question which is
put here. As always in Allen&#x27;s films, in an entertaining way.
