For the past couple of decades, I&#x27;ve lost track of Woody Allen. Back in
the 70s when I was in high school and college, a new Woody Allen movie
was a cultural event. These days, they show up regularly like buses,
and, like buses, they frequently go by without me even noticing them.
(It doesn&#x27;t help that I no longer live in a major movie market town.)
Every once in a while I&#x27;ll check to see what he&#x27;s done lately, and rent
a title; usually this results in mild to severe disappointment.<br /><br />But what a charmer &#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; is. I love Paris, and obviously
Woody does too; the camera lingers on one beautiful sight after
another. I thought for a while that this film was going to end up like
&#x22;Brigadoon,&#x22; with a modern character willingly trapped in the past by
love. But Woody gives the plot a fresh twist, with a lesson to be
learned, especially by creative types. The cameos by the great writers
and artists of the past are wonderful, and the &#x22;modern times&#x22; plot
involving a doomed relationship is also handled well. The period music
is also enjoyable, but Woody: why did you have to play that same guitar
tune over and over? I almost lost my mind, but I was enjoying the rest
of the movie too much to care.
