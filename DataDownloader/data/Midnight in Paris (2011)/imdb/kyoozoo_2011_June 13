Why does every actor in a lead role in a Woody Allen movie have to
pretend to be Woody these days? Owen Wilson is doing what Kenneth
Branagh did in Celebrity, being a whiny nebbish who for some reason a
lot of people seem to love. As for the film, I find it to be a typical
Woody Allen empty shell. Words, words, words, and behind them
nothingness. Contrived passion, contrived love, contrived friendship...
contrived humanity. Every human bonding, every human connection, reeks
of artificiality. There&#x27;s little there. People just talk, and act. Is
this intentional? I hate it. I&#x27;m often depressed after I see a Woody
Allen film, disappointed by people, by the world. If this is an
intentional commentary on the supeficiality of humanity, it works
better; therefore, I think instead of watching his next film I&#x27;ll just
contemplate jumping off a cliff instead, and save one step. His saving
grace used to be that he is a skilled filmmaker, and can be rousingly
funny. Midnight in Paris is technically flawless, beautiful to look at,
the soundtrack is excellent, and there are a few funny moments in the
film, like when the detective who&#x27;s following the protagonist ends up
being chased by some royal bodyguards in Mr. Allen&#x27;s French nostalgia
fantasyland. And OK, I got it - the &#x22;good old days&#x22; is an illusion. Mr.
Allen succeeds in leaping beyond words with this one. But every
relationship macrocosm, and indeed, the universes that are individual
human souls, are empty. This is the usual epic failure, to yet again
fail to tap into these unlimited resources. I didn&#x27;t feel a thing for
any of the characters, because there was little there. I was surely
supposed to, wasn&#x27;t I? In Woody Allen films, the greats and the
ordinary are reduced to talking heads who use big words and have no
soul.
