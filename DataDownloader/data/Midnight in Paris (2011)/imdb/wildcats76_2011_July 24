I understand that this picture is supposed to be a feel-good fantasy,
with some mild intellectual insight. But I wanted to point out that the
wildly Liberal Woody Allen doesn&#x27;t show any minorities in his idealized
version of the streets of Paris. Nor do most romantic comedies set in
Paris or New York and geared toward an upper middle class, white
professional audience.<br /><br />But given his politics, it seems ironic or telling, that he doesn&#x27;t
show groups of angry, young disaffected North African Muslims roaming
the streets,nor images of black ghettos, Asian vendors, etc. To him,
European Social Democracy is bliss, and Paris does not suffer from the
plagues of urban decay that debase our cities in the U.S. Normally I
would call him a liar and a hypocrite. Let&#x27;s face it, he wants to live
in a white, upper middle class world, no matter how virulently he jabs
at Tea Party Republicans in this movie.<br /><br />Yes, he makes sure that his alter-ego, the main character, spews some
vicious vitriol at his Republican in-laws-to-be. In addition, he
portrays them as condescending, culture-less, materialists throughout.<br /><br />Owen Wilson does channel Woody Allen&#x27;s neurotic persona to some degree,
but I think that&#x27;s o.k. It&#x27;s Woody&#x27;s film, and he used to play the main
character in his films when he was younger. Wilson keeps it fresh,
naive, and lovable, without conveying the cynicism of former characters
played by Allen. I give both Allen and Wilson credit for this.<br /><br />The historical characters are over-the-top, comic book-like
caricatures. I don&#x27;t know whether Allen intended this. The plot device
of time travel, while not unique, was mildly entertaining. I don&#x27;t
think the cinematography focused on the right images at all. Too many
clich&#xE9;s, and not enough subtle hole-in-the-wall beauty.<br /><br />The dialog was nothing special, but the point made, about the past
being overrated and relative, was more profound than what most modern
movies serve us. <br /><br />I found the clarinet music obnoxious and oppressive, but I know that
Allen plays the clarinet, and again, it&#x27;s his movie. Maybe other people
liked the music. That&#x27;s fine with me.<br /><br />The bottom line is that Woody Allen is a Godless Liberal hypocrite, but
he does have an endearing sense of romance and hope mixed in with his
fear of death, and his loathing of half the human race.
