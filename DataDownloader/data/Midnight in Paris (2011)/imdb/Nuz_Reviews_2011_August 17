Woody Allen is really one of those film guys that you either leave or
take, hate or like. And, Midnight in Paris follows that exact same
proposed formula. Here&#x27;s a romantic-comedy that questions love and
belonging with a bit of fantasy involved.<br /><br />Both written and directed by Woody Allen, this is a film that really
engages his ideas and thoughts. We see some political talk, some
romantic babble, and philosophical reasoning for belonging.<br /><br />I haven&#x27;t seen much of any Woody Allen films (which will change!) so
it&#x27;s hard for me to do a comparison. But, I have seen selected clips,
heard about the guy, and kind of familiar with his work. With that
being said, I&#x27;m sure that Owen Wilson will remind viewers of Wood Allen
to some sort of degree; I&#x27;m unsure how extreme it truly is.<br /><br />The comedy aspect of this film truly comes from the character
development and interactions of Owen Wilson&#x27;s character, Gil. Wilson
fans and even those non-Wilson fans alike should enjoy. I hope. <br /><br />Perhaps the only problem I had with this film was the question of how
Owen Wilson&#x27;s character, Gil, travels in time. At first it seems to be
a hallucination. But, if that&#x27;s the only problem you have, just ignore
it and take it for what it is.<br /><br />This feature is an English major&#x27;s dream, especially those
concentrating on American Lit.<br /><br />Although successful, Hollywood hack writer Gil (Owen Wilson) is on a
vacation with his lovely fianc&#xE9; Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents
(Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy). Before we see them, a wonderful opening
montage scene of Paris, France is shown to the audience. It was quite
pleasant right after the opening credits. It really set the tone for
the movie. Beautiful scenery and music. We then hear Gil&#x27;s voice
accentuating the praise for Paris by quoting something regarding how
the 1920s and the rain really bring up it&#x27;s beauty. Inez is not
pleased.<br /><br />Side note: Gil kind of reminded me of a more reserved Hank Moody (David
Duchovny) from Showtime&#x27;s Californication.<br /><br />We see from the very start of the film that Inez and Gil seem to be
deeply in love, but perhaps Gil loves something else entirely: Paris.
Inez plans on living the American Dream in Malibu, California with
hopes that Gil will continue to be a successful Hollywood screenwriter.
Gil disapproves of this and dreams of settling down in Paris to write
his books.<br /><br />****This is where the spoilers may start, so continue at your own
risk.***<br /><br />Gil and Inez go out to a wine tasting with Inez&#x27;s friends, Paul
(Michael Sheen) and Carol (Nina Arianda). To Gil&#x27;s dismay and Inez&#x27;s
pleasure, Paul invites them to go dancing for the evening. While Inez
accepts, Gil denies, and the two split off for the rest of the night.
It&#x27;s obvious that Gil is frustrated by Paul&#x27;s inaccurate knowledge of
Paris. Gil decides to head back to the hotel, but eventually finds
himself lost in an alley. Then, an old looking vehicle of some kind
pulls up and insists that he joins them. He then meets those that he
deems to be idols like, Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll), Cole Porter
(Yves Heck), Joesphine Barker (Sonia Rolland), F. Scott Fitzgerald (Tom
Hiddleston), Zelda Fitzgerald (Alison Pill), and later on Gertrude
Stein (Kathy Bates), Pablo Picasso (Marcial Di Fonzo Bo), and Picasso&#x27;s
mistress Adriana (Marion Cotillard)(more on her later). You can see why
an American Lit enthusiast would be overly joyous. All the
aforementioned actors did a great job, with the chief mention going to
Bate&#x27;s portrayal of Stein. You&#x27;ll see many other &#x27;1920ers&#x27; in the film
too and perhaps even some famous individuals from an even earlier time.<br /><br />Then one night, with such exuberant excitement and by the reluctance of
his fianc&#xE9;, Gil urges her to join him the next time he goes &#x22;back in
time&#x22; in the alley. Gil has told Inez that he has been inspired by late
night walks around Paris. Inez leaves before the bells strike midnight
and Inez&#x27;s frustration is fueled even further. Her conservative parents
are also annoyed by Gil.<br /><br />Gil continues to ride the old &#x27;20s vehicle every night and finds his
current novel is well liked during that time. It treats him like a
drug. <br /><br />Perhaps Gil found love in someone other than his fianc&#xE9; and Paris.
Adriana and Gil have an ongoing conversation throughout the film about
how each of them wishes to live in a &#x22;simpler time.&#x22; Being the 1920s
for Gil and the late-1800s for Adriana. They come to the conclusion
that nobody will ever be able to live in a time before their own. At
this point in the movie I could sympathize with the main message of
Woody Allen, since I too would want to have grown up in the 1980s or
possibly 1990s. A time when jobs were flourishing and the radio was
acceptable and when people didn&#x27;t text during a personal oral
conversation. I really enjoyed this message of mystery brings
enlightenment by Allen. <br /><br />At the end of the film we see Gil walk off with a street market vendor
he met earlier, Gabrielle (L&#xE9;a Seydoux). They walk off in the rain and
seem to spark a relationship.<br /><br />Woody Allen did an all-around phenomenal job with this film. I&#x27;m glad
to see that he&#x27;s still got it.<br /><br />I highly recommend you take your significant other to go and see it.
Have an open-mind and enjoy some great cinema.<br /><br />9/10 Stars.
