I found it just totally narcissistic, masturbatory, self-indulgent.<br /><br />How can u make a film about Paris in the 20s (dragging in Hemingway,
Gertrude Stein, Picasso, Scott Fitzgerald, Salvador Dali, Louis Bunuel)
and NOT mention the most famous writer of them all who lived in Paris
from 1919 to 1940???????? Namely, James Joyce, and note that ALL other
writers living in Paris at that time acknowledged Joyce as THE leading
writer of that generation.<br /><br />The main actor (character&#x27;s name is Gil) was like a youthful carbon
copy of Woody Allen himself. It was fluff, flimsy and barely humorous.
Good acting by the American girl-friend. Also good cameo role by
Michael Sheen.
