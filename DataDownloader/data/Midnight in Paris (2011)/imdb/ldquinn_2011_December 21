What? This film is not a goofball comedy with Owen Wilson&#x27;s whiney
voice? OK, the voice is naturally whiney; but, Wilson really is a very
good fit for this part.<br /><br />Is there great acting here? Not really - at least not by the major
current day characters; but, go back to the turn of the century
characters and it&#x27;s wonderfully acted. Probably a function of more
robust writing for the older scenes and a bit of a plodding script for
current day.<br /><br />All that negativism behind me, this is really quite an enjoyable film -
an interesting premise for a story, generally well written, excellent
direction and amazing sets. How could they not be amazing, you say,
after all, it is Paris. But, how many of us have seen Paris, let alone
at the turn of the century.<br /><br />All in all, Woody Allen has done it again. A warm, successful, somewhat
twisted film that is a great way to spend a couple of hours.
