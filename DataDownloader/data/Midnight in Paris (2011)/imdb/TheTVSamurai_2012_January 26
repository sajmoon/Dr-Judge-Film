Ahhh Mr Woody Allen, you either hate his work or love his work. I
wouldn&#x27;t necessarily call myself a big Woody Allen fan but I&#x27;ve seen a
lot of his films (2000 and up) and I either really enjoy them or find
them a complete waste of time (usually cause of the way it ends),
there&#x27;s hardly ever a middle ground. Match Point&#x97;loved it, Scoop&#x97;hated
it, Cassandra&#x27;s Dream&#x97;hated it, Vicky Cristina Barcelona&#x97;loved
it...Midnight in Paris&#x97;loved it.<br /><br />Midnight in Paris comes stacked with a very impressive cast. I&#x27;m
surprised with the choice of Owen Wilson as the lead protagonist
especially with Allen&#x27;s recent history of casting, how we say, more
alpha male, less goofy type male leads in the likes of Ewan McGregor,
Colin Farrel, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Hugh Jackman...you get the picture,
Owen Wilson simply doesn&#x27;t really fit that list. Having said that, I
felt Owen Wilson&#x27;s soft hearted, goofy boyish charm worked really well
for the character of Gil. Rest of the cast includes Rachel McAdams,
Kurt Fuller, Mimi Kennedy, Michael Sheen, Alison Pill, Tom Hiddleston,
Kathy Bates, Adrien Brody, L&#xE9;a Seydoux and my very personal favorite,
the very beautiful and talented Marion Cotillard. Cotillard plays
Adriana, a beautiful women that catches the eye of Gil (as well as many
others).<br /><br />The story is quite simple, Gil (Owen Wilson, Hall Pass) and his fianc&#xE9;,
Inez (Rachel McAdams, The Notebook) and her parents are visiting Paris
for business. Gil, a writer who feels a little bit uninspired as of
late, feels like he needs to live in Paris for a little while to suck
in the artsy and romantic culture to become inspired so he can finish
his novel but Inez doesn&#x27;t share the same perspective. I don&#x27;t want to
reveal anymore to the story because I went into this movie reading only
the brief synopsis listed on IMDb which basically reveals nothing and I
was pleasantly surprised. I will say this though, it was a interesting,
different and very simple approach that Woody Allen used to execute his
concept for this story and I thought it worked very well and in a very
suitable Woody Allen fashion.<br /><br />The only hint I would give is the film involves a lot of discussions
involving historical characters such as Zelda Fitzgerald, Ernest
Hemingway and Pablo Picasso, to name a few. Is it important that you
know your history for this film? It&#x27;ll probably be a bonus but it wont
distract you from the main story and the message that Woody Allen is
trying to convey. At the heart of Midnight in Paris is of course, like
all Woody Allen films, a romantic love story but its also about people
living in the past, people who find the present boring and
unfulfilling, people who crave nostalgia and blame the emptiness of the
present simply because they are afraid to face the future. Something I
feel that we can all relate to, at least once in our life.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed my viewing experience with this film. Paris
was perfectly chosen to capture the art, culture and romance to tell
this story. The variety of very talented actors and characters kept
things very interesting and made me want to learn more and more about
each character. I loved the presence that Marion Cotillard&#x27;s character,
Adriana brought to the screen. Her outgoing, contagious charm and
flirtatiousness was the total opposite of Inez and it created quite a
bi-polar dynamic when you see each of the characters interact with the
lead character, giving us a chance to see how Gil reacts to two very
different love interests. I&#x27;m surprised I&#x27;m saying this, but I really
enjoyed the chemistry between Gil and Adriana, if you were just to tell
me to compare the two actors, I would&#x27;ve never believed it but just
goes to show how well the writing was done (I&#x27;d love to see another
Woody Allen film with Marion Cotillard as the lead but I digress). The
dialogue in all their late night walking scenes were really well
written and well shot. Midnight in Paris is a solid movie, full of
diverse characters, with an interesting concept executed in a simple
but enjoyable way that oozes Woody Allen&#x97;suffice to say, if you are a
fan of the director&#x27;s work, you will enjoy this film.<br /><br />You can read the full review along with other movie reviews at:
