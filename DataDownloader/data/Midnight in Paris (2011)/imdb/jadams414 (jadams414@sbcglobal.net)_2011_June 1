2011_June 1 
After reading other reviews/opinions ~ I must add mine as well. When I
saw the trailer (via computer &#x26; IMDb) I KNEW I had to see this film.
the lines outside the theatre were around the block. We were next in
line for the following show . . yeah, that popular. My 1st impression
of it had me oohing and aahing, and laughing as well with the rest of
the audience. I love &#x22;time-travel&#x22;, love Paris, love Woody Allen, so
naturally, this movie swept me away. My original thought of &#x22;why Owen
Wilson&#x22;? was quickly quelled when I realized he&#x27;s the perfect Southern
Calif. man from 2011. He played it to the hilt! It gave all the other
actors a special patina of another era. And Woody wrapped it up nicely,
even if we suspected this might occur. I want to see it again!
