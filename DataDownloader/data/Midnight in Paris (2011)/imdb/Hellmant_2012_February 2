&#x27;MIDNIGHT IN Paris&#x27;: Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br /><br />Woody Allen&#x27;s most critically acclaimed film in 6 years and his most
financially successful movie ever (before adjusting for inflation).
It&#x27;s received 4 Academy Award nominations including &#x27;Best Picture&#x27;,
&#x27;Best Director&#x27;, &#x27;Best Original Screenplay&#x27; and &#x27;Art Direction&#x27; but
will be lucky to win one (most likely screenplay). The film is a
fantasy comedy and for those who really like Allen it&#x27;s sure to please,
others could be lucky to find a little enjoyment.<br /><br />The film reunites Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams for the first time
since 2005&#x27;s &#x27;WEDDING CRASHERS&#x27;. They play a couple (Gil and Inez) who
are vacationing with Inez&#x27;s rich parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy)
on their business trip in Paris. Gil is a popular screenwriter who&#x27;s
attempting to write his first novel but is suffering some severe
writer&#x27;s block. Gil has always been in love with Paris, especially it
of yesteryear (specifically the 1920&#x27;s), so he&#x27;s hoping to find some
much needed inspiration there. Inez thanks he&#x27;s a dreamer and should go
back to writing screenplays. One night while traveling the streets of
Paris alone he finds something magical and possibly the inspiration he
was looking for.<br /><br />I&#x27;ve never been a big Woody Allen fan so I don&#x27;t usually seek his films
out. I watched this film because of it&#x27;s financial and critical success
and found it slightly better than Allen&#x27;s other work but still nothing
too special. It is funny and witty in places, Wilson is great in the
lead and he and the film are charming (in places) but for me that&#x27;s
about all the film had to offer. Like I said if you&#x27;re an Allen fan
though I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll eat this s--- up. Everyone else will find it
mildly amusing at best.<br /><br />Watch our movie review show &#x27;MOVIE TALK&#x27; at:
