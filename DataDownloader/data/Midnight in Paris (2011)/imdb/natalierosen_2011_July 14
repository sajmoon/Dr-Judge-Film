Woody Allen yet again serves up a thought provoking, entertaining and
brilliant film. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Have you ever wondered if it
would have been better to have been born in a previous era? Woody Allen
helps us answer that question by having us time travel a bit through
the experiences of a young writer attempting to publish his first work
which has as its setting a memorabilia shop filled with things of
bygone eras which interest him. In this era, however, he travels with
his shallow fianc&#xE9; and her conservative condescending parents to Paris
where the hero is smitten with its beauty and culture. What his fianc&#xE9;
does not know is that at the stroke of midnight our protagonist is
transported to another era -- the Roaring Twenties &#x96; complete with Cole
Porter music, Ernest Hemingway literature, Picasso art and Gertrude
Stein as critic of the book he has just written.<br /><br />This is a wonderful film especially if one has a general familiarity of
the art, literature and music of that era as well as a general
understanding of cultural settings in times other than our own. The
film is brilliant and clever as only Woody Allen can be. The
protagonist could certainly have been Woody Allen himself as he has
played similar roles in many of his earlier works and if it were in a
different era perhaps 20 years ago then Woody would have played the
lead role instead of Owen Wilson whom I think was excellent.<br /><br />Allen&#x27;s talent will endure long after all who have enjoyed the genre of
his films have left the scene. He brings a flavor to his films that is
unique to him and yet carries with it something that touches all of us
by trying to understand the human condition, its philosophical
dilemmas, its heartaches, its romantic love, its joys, its fears, its
failures and its triumphs.<br /><br />Which era would you want to return? I always say the late 60&#x27;s but
&#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; warns us each era has its problems and its
vicissitudes as mankind tries to improve upon his historical condition
from generation to generation. It, therefore, gives us pause for
thought maybe the era in which we do live is the best era of all. It is
surely the only one we know.
