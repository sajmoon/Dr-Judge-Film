I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from Midnight in Paris.I like only a few
of Woody Allan&#x27;s movies and even less of Owen Wilson&#x27;s.I was pleasantly
surprised to find it perfect for a visual art graduate like
myself.Perfect casting for the 1920 characters of Gertrude
Stein,Picasso,Toulouse Lautrec and the Fitzgeralds.Owen Wilson was so
believable.Wonderful shots of Versailles and Giverny.I didn&#x27;t want it
to end.I shall see it again and buy it when it comes out on DVD.It was
a wonderful escape on a Sunday afternoon.The three of us thoroughly
enjoyed it.I thought it was cleverly written with believable
dialogue.It is a must for those interested in the arts scene in Paris
in 1920.Superb music score as well.Thank you,Woody for providing the
magic
