Even the bravest fans of Woody Allen will say that he misses his mark
for a good decade already. However in his 41st film, Allen shows us the
qualities that make us fall in love with him for. Witty dialogue,
cynical nature, feeling out of place in society, life and everything in
general, Midnight in Paris is a perfect dose of dream, reality and
fiction. Allen&#x27;s films are never for everyone and despite my nativity
of the works of 1920s artists, the film simply intrigue me immensely.
Owen Wilson impresses me and every minute movement reminds me of Woody
Allen and in particular revokes one of his greatest achievement in
Annie Hall. Marion Cotillard is simply breathtakingly beautiful, with
brilliant on-screen presence and single-handedly lifts the film above
its genre conventions. Cotillard is one amazing actress and it&#x27;s
difficult not to see why Wilson is falling head over heels over her.
All in all, Midnight in Paris reminds those of us who feel as though we
belong in another era. Then again at the same time, allude to us that
people always get carried away about the past generation achievements
of the Einsteins and the Shakespeares, when they themselves are the
ones who can become the next Steve Jobs. As Allen puts it: &#x22;That&#x27;s what
the present is. It&#x27;s a little unsatisfying because life is
unsatisfying.&#x22; At least the film is satisfying&#x85; <br /><br />Neo rates it 9/10.
