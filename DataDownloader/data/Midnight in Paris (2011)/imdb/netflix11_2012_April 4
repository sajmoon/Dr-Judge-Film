This movie will take you out of your neighborhood, town, city, and
place you squarely in Paris for an hour and a half. Cheap and easy way
to see the world right? During most of the movie, I was really
skeptical because the plot seemed so unrealistic and felt almost as if
I was tricked into watching it. After all, the trailer gave a
completely different picture about what the movie would be about. But
by the end, this movie made me reminiscence about my own visit to Paris
and to study French again! To truly enjoy it, remember to let go of
reality and you will have a wonderful experience.<br /><br />Story (3.0/3.0): This is not the typical chick flick as the trailer may
suggest, and you will be frustrated if that is what you are expecting.
But take a step back and just enjoy the movie. The plot structure is
very unique. There is also great character development for the main
character, who realizes an important insight that may be useful in all
of our lives. You will learn a bit about the culture, literary, and
arts of the 1920&#x27;s and see much of &#x22;touristy Paris&#x22; as well.<br /><br />Acting (2.4/3.0): Owen Wilson does a great job playing an awkward and
often confused guy. Adrian Brody has a minor role but does a great job
playing a caricature that will crack you up. Rachel McAdams was
probably thrown in just for the sex appeal toward guys. But the best
acting job was done by Marion Coutillard. For those of us who&#x27;ve only
seen her in Inception, her acting here is 10x better and captures
perfectly her seductiveness and dream-like quality.<br /><br />Cinematography (2.0/2.0): The movie is BEAUTIFULLY made. The color hues
add a vintage artistic feel to it. The modern day Paris is very
realistic and just as how I had remembered it.<br /><br />Music (0.8/1.0): Typical French music as expected but it fits
perfectly.<br /><br />Rewatchability (1.0/1.0): You will leave with theories about what the
ending means and will want to rewatch it with this new perspective!<br /><br />Overall score: 9.1/10.0
