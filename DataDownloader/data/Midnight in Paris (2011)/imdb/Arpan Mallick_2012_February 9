a very beautiful film. simple yet so captivating. i was watching this
film yesterday @ midnight and i was feeling like i was wandering on the
streets and alleyways of Paris, getting ideas, discovering the city
like never before. surely this film is one of the best from woody
Allen. he blended drama, fantasy, imagination in such a way that this
film is bound to impress you. i was completely absorbed while watching.
as for the performance, everyone was just great. i liked the casting.
Owen Wilson did a very nice job. marion cottillard was beautiful and
just perfect for her role. the music was so much french. loved it. the
cinematography was splendid. certainly, its the year&#x27;s one of the best
experience!
