Midnight in Paris is a wonderful work, full of passion and soul. As
expected, Woody Allen shows you Paris though the eyes of love, but
mostly through they eyes of a nostalgic all time tourist, in Paris.<br /><br />The direction is wonderful, as is the general acting. In my point of
view, Owen Wilson could have done a better work. He often seems more
idiotic than lost, and he keeps delivering the lines as he would in any
other movie he played.<br /><br />The plot if really entertaining. It creates the illusion it was
intended for, and, although, the ending might seem predictable the
conclusions and the message itself is not.<br /><br />Not one of the best movies, not even one of the best of Woody Allen,
but it is what it promises to be, time and place, love and life,
questioned and answered wonderfully. If you are looking for a light but
good movie to watch, you found it.
