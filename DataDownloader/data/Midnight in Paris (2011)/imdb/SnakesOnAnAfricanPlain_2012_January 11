Midnight in Paris had so much hoopla surrounding it, that I was wary of
approaching it. As someone that enjoys writing myself, the story of a
writer could easily connect with me, or it could have annoyed me.
Luckily it did the former. Wilson plays a Hollywood screenwriter that
wants to work on his novel while in Paris. Unfortunately, and I never
thought I&#x27;d say this, he is engaged to Rachel McAdams. She has become
comfortable with his lifestyle, and doesn&#x27;t want him to give everything
up for something he may struggle with. WHile in Paris they meet up with
Michael Sheen, playing a pedantic ass to perfection. I just wanted to
cave his head in, and Wilson played off him exactly the way I would
have done. Sheen&#x27;s so called knowledge is the sauce of humour during
the early half of the movie, as he gets his facts mixed up. Wilson soon
winds up in the 1920&#x27;s and meets his own literary heroes. Finally
feeling appreciated, he spends every evening with his new found
friends. This is certainly a film about writing, art, creativity, and
being accepted. But it also goes further, looking at how all past is
glamorised to a certain degree. This was a lovely film, with my only
gripe being McAdams&#x27; character. She was simply so unappealing, that I
had no idea as to why herself and Wilson were together. There was no
chemistry, and not even a hint at anything resembling love. Luckily,
such a poor relationship made it easier to accept some of Wilsons&#x27;
actions. A great lot of co-starring roles are filled out by A-Listers
having a lot of fun as classic artists from the past. Midnight in
Paris, really is for those that love to walk in the rain.
