Seydoux , Adrien de Van , Gad Elmaleh.<br /><br />Directed by Woody Allen with an endlist list of movies he directed, one
of the best directors ever.<br /><br />great, i finally got a chance to see one of my most awaited movies of
the year. one of the best reviewed movie of this year and i must say
that Woody Allen is back. though i loved Vicky, Christina, Barcelona
and i don&#x27;t remember about Match Point but overall these 10 to 15 years
were not very good for him but this movie is a great turning point for
him. also this movie was such a different and refreshing experience,
one of the nicest experience i had in a while. you just don&#x27;t get to
see movies like this nowadays very often.<br /><br />this movie opens with the shots of the different parts of the most
beautiful city in the world Paris, different time of the day and while
raining. i mean i was literally stunned for a Paris lover like me. it
is like Woody is giving tribute to the city he showed Paris so
beautifully some shots were really good. so great cinematography this
movie had.<br /><br />Art direction was good. costumes were great. excellent editing.
Dialogues could have been better considering Woody&#x27;s movies has the
best dialogues but still overall it works good. Good direction he did
his best. Screenplay was good i think better than many of his latest
offerings. story was fresh and interesting to watch. good technical and
written work overall. i won&#x27;t call it the Woody&#x27;s best even though i
haven&#x27;t seen much of his movies but i am his big fan.<br /><br />this story is about Owen Wilson as Gil and Rachel McAdams as Inez they
are soon to be married they come to Paris just for visiting their
parents as they have business there. Inez is a very annoying and
frustrating character. Gil on the other hand is in love with Paris and
want&#x27;s to settle there. he loves every detail of it. walking through
the streets, loving the beauty of Paris in rains and at night unlike
most of the other modern souls. he is coping with his writing and his
life while he is walking he gets lost and reach a place where as soon
as clock strucks midnight, he time travels and reaches the 20&#x27;s Paris
while meeting and interacting with some of the greatest writers and
artists of that time.<br /><br />though the surprising thing of time travel fantasy was spoiled way
before i saw this movie but still it was superb actually watching it.
anyways the acting performances, Owen Wilson did good which is shocking
as even he in the first place was an odd choice for a Woody Allen movie
but he pulled it off quite well. nice performance and was well enough
in his character and likable too. Rachel McAdams was superbly annoying
and just average. Marion Cotillard was really stunning and good and
actually someone that might come in your fantasy dream. Kathy Bates was
nice and so were other actors like Carla Bruni, Adrien Brody and
Michael Sheen. this movie doesn&#x27;t have the kind of performances that
will get Oscar attention considering his track record of giving
supporting actresses and actors some Oscar swag. screenplay is worth
getting nomination along with the costumes, art and cinematography
while i am also opting for Editing. and wait a minute i almost forgot
to say it had a good score too.<br /><br />well this is a very sweet, charming and light hearted Woody rom com
that has bit of fantasy touch to it. while it may not have a lough out
loud comedy but this is how his movies are but still the underlying
light hearted moments are enough to bring smile on your faces. it was
such an excellent movie that kept growing on me and it left me feeling
so good while still i am thinking about it. this dream like feel to it
was great. one of the best and my favorite movie od the year. i loved
it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
