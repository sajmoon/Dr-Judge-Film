Much of the praise for this mismatched collection of freshman art
history inspired stories emanates from critics&#x27; desire for Woody Allen
to finally get his groove back after a twenty year string of
unwatchable films. Allen pulls out the elements of past glories but
they serves them at a discount given his reduced stature. Paris stock
footage replaces filming in Manhattan, Owen Wilson does a California
hippie version of the quick-witted New York neurotic character and the
antagonists are one-dimensional stock Tea Party baddies. The think
premise involves bringing past painters (Picasso) and writers
(Hemingway) to life but giving them little of interest to say to
nebbish-y Gil the main character who travels backward in time to meet
them. Only Adrien Brody entertains by playing Salvador Dali as a
frustratingly over-the-top lunatic &#x96; perhaps Brody has far better
comedic chops than we all suspected. The arc of the story follows a
path predictable from the outset and only the ghosts of great lines
from Allen films of the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s serve to break up what feels like
twice the 94 minute run-time. In short, wait another probably eight
months for the next Allen theatric attempt.
