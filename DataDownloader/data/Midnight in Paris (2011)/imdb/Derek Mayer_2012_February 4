2012_February 4 
I was very hesitant to watch this film because I&#x27;m not a huge Woody
Allen fan. I could not have been more wrong! This is a great film that
contains a strong performance from Owen Wilson and the rest of the
supporting cast. Woody Allen&#x27;s script and his directing are what I
believe to be second to none this year. y It is nice to see Rachel
McAdams playing such a character that everyone doesn&#x27;t love. Michael
Sheen is very funny as well and stole a lot of scenes from Owen. I
believe Owen Wilson got snubbed by Oscar for his very strong and subtle
performance. In my opinion though Midnight In Paris will steal the show
at the Oscar by winning best picture in a huge upset!! Don&#x27;t skip out
on this picture or you will be &#x22;caught out in the rain&#x22;
