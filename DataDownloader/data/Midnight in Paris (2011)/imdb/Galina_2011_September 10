It had to happen sooner or later, and finally it did. Woody Allen and
Paris &#x22;fell&#x22; in love with each other, and, as the result, we, the
viewers, received a precious gift from the master of subtle,
intelligent and charming dra-medies, gentle and charming &#x22;movable
feast,&#x22; the new movie &#x22;Midnight in Paris &#x22;.<br /><br />I have been a fan of Woody Allen for long time and seen all his movies,
those that he made, and those in which he starred or only wrote the
screenplay for. I look forward to each of his films and I am ready to
love them before I even see them. I knew I would like Midnight in
Paris, but I had no idea how good it was. From the first frame,
following the Darius Khondji&#x27;s camera on such familiar but uniquely
beautiful streets, alleys, boulevards and quays of the City of Light,
it was hard not to fall in love with Paris and with the film of Allen,
his love letter to the most famous city in the world, capital of love
and Mecca for writers, artists, musicians and artists to whom Paris
gave inspiration during all times and epochs - Belle &#xC9;poque 1890s, the
Golden days of the 1920s, and today, right now...<br /><br />Midnight in Paris is a delightful, kind (yes, this is Woody Allen),
light, and charming film, which can be described as A Paris Midnight
Magical Movable Feast. Paris in the film is beautiful during day light,
night time, bright sun, and rainy hours. Oscar nominee, the master
cinematographer of many remarkable films, including Panic Room, Se7en
and Evita, Darius Khondji worked with Allen on three films: Anything
Else (2003), Midnight in Paris (2011), and the next film, the Roman
project Bop Decameron (2012).<br /><br />Soundtrack consists of Allen&#x27;s favorite songs from the 1920s-30s by
such songwriters as Cole Porter, Glen Miller, and Enoch Light, and from
the repertoire of Josephine Baker and Juliet Greco. For the original
film theme, Allen picked the guitar composition of the French jazz
guitarist Stephane Wrembel &#x22;Bistro Fada&#x22;. Wrembel&#x27;s influence and
source of inspiration has been the music of the famous French Gypsy
guitarist Django Reinhardt, whose longtime fan and admirer is Woody
Allen himself. According Wrembel, Allen was searching for a typical
French-Parisian melody, reflecting the spirit and atmosphere of Paris.
I can confirm that the film theme and the songs that Allen picked up
for Midnight in Paris are important, integral component of the film&#x27;s
charm and add to the romantic and joyous feeling that the film brings
to the viewers.<br /><br />As always, in Woody Allen&#x27;s movies, the actors give uniformly good
performances. Owen Wilson is very convincing and likable as Gil,
Hollywood&#x27;s successful screenplay writer who works on a first novel, a
protagonist, a much younger, attractive, and funny Woody Allen
stand-in. Adrien Brody played the best role since The Pianist (very
small cameo, but memorable and hilarious). Kathy Bates was very
believable as a famous literary critic and friend to the struggling
talented writers and artists. Alison Pill was impressive as the bright,
outgoing but showing the signs of instability wife of the celebrated
American writer. I hardly recognized Corey Stoll but liked him a lot as
another famous American writer. Watching Marion Cotillard, I had no
problems believing that the character she played, Adriana, could have
been the muse and the girlfriend of not just one but three amazingly
and uniquely talented world renowned painters. Rachel McAdams (Inez,
Gil&#x27;s not so romantic fianc&#xE9;e), Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy (Inez&#x27;s
parents on the business trip in Paris who don&#x27;t seem to approve their
daughter&#x27;s choice), and Michael Sheen (Paul, Inez&#x27;s pedantic and
arrogant former boyfriend from college) were quite good as not very
likable Americans. The First Lady of France, Carla Bruni appeared in a
small role of a museum guide.<br /><br />The story itself was so lovely in using the time travel as the plot
device and brought so many funny and sharp one-liners, dialogs and
scenes as well as the plenty moments of recognizing the beloved
literature and art figures of the past, that I sat and smiled happily
during the whole film. Like I mentioned in the beginning, I expected to
love the film even before I saw it and knew from the very first scene
that I was in for something very special but my husband, who is much
more reserved in his ratings and not often calls a film a masterpiece,
used the word for Midnight in Paris and asked whether the film has won
some prestigious prizes. Well, the awards season is several months
away, but for me, and I am sure for all Woody Allen&#x27;s fans, Midnight in
Paris is a great prize from the writer/director.
