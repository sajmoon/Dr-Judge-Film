Have you ever wanted to see Owen Wilson play a modern day Alvy Singer
and then transport him into the 1920s? I&#x27;m assuming that nobody other
than Woody Allen has even thought about doing that. But trust me, now
you&#x27;ll want to see it. &#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; pairs ingenious casting with
Allen&#x27;s usual parade of characters (a neurotic writer, a right-wing
Republican ignoramus, and a pedantic know-it-all) and places them in
Paris.<br /><br />Woody Allen movies are typically described as a love affair with the
city, but this one is just so much more. It&#x27;s not just a love affair
with Paris, but with the romanticism of Paris, and with the idea of the
best years of the city, and a love affair that is too crazy to be real
that we don&#x27;t even call it cheating.<br /><br />Here we get a romantic comedy, and at the beginning, one that appears
that it could be a very standard romantic comedy. But we flirt with
philosophical notions of loving and living in the past, and of wanting
to live in a time that has past, and then we heavily flirt and engage
with the golden-age of literature. That&#x27;s where the intelligence,
education and Allen&#x27;s pure intellect come in, but he makes it
hilarious, not heavy.<br /><br />&#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; is, quite literally, one of the smartest and
funniest movies I have ever seen. It&#x27;s almost as smart as &#x22;Crimes and
Misdemeanors&#x22; (1989) and just as funny as &#x22;Annie Hall&#x22; (1977). It will
take a few more years and viewings before I can officially place it in
that order of Woody Allen&#x27;s best films, which for the most part is the
same as the World&#x27;s best films. But after the best night out at the
cinema I have ever had, I have no doubt that&#x27;s where &#x22;Midnight in
Paris&#x22; will go.
