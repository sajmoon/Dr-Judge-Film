Woody Allen seems to be in his element after a long long while...a well
deserved pause and I must say what an intellectual pause eh! A fabulous
screenplay,the most original I have encountered till to date. Shooting
Paris la&#x27; Manhattan was anticipated but execution is unpretentious...a
difficult task in this age of high end computer graphics tantalizingly
at your beck and call. Casting of &#x27;1920s Greats&#x27; was to the &#x22;T&#x22;.
&#x27;Rhinoceros&#x27; Dali is the manifestation of wicked wicked Allen and you
can imagine the understated &#x27;throat clearing&#x27; pause from Woody whilst
writing and filming &#x27;Rhinoceros&#x27; scenes..<br /><br />Am a great fan of Woody and my bias may be glaring but I am proud of
it. More power to him and his ilk. Am in nervous anticipation as to
when he writes a script based on Indian sensibilities?!!!
