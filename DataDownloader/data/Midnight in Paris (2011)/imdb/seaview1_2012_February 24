One of the most productive and sought after directors (by actors),
Woody Allen, has made dozens of films that deal with the often
turbulent relationships between men and women. Almost exclusively a New
Yorker by heart, Allen has begun a renaissance of sorts with his
exploration of European settings in particular Paris, France, and
although his films of the past decade have varied in quality, his
latest, Midnight in Paris, is a standout and represents the
writer/director at the top of his game.<br /><br />Opening with a spectacular collage of vignettes, Paris never looked
more enticing or romantic (Manhattan redux). At the fabled Giverny,
Monet&#x27;s source of inspiration, an American couple, Gil (Owen Wilson)
and Inez (Rachel McAdams) are engaged to be married and yet squabble
constantly. An idealist, He is smitten by the culture and history of
Paris, and one night while strolling the streets alone, a vintage car
drives by and gives him a ride to a caf&#xE9;. Gil realizes that he has been
transported to 1920&#x27;s Paris and is mingling with the celebrities of its
heyday including some famous American ex-patriots like Ernest
Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Gil is struggling
with a novel and needs some advice, so who better than Gertrude Stein
(amusingly played by Kathy Bates) to critique the manuscript? Upon his
return to present day Paris, Gil wonders if it was all a dream but the
scene repeats itself the next evening at midnight when he meets Pablo
Picasso and the beautiful Adriana (Marion Cotillard), who captures
Gil&#x27;s fancy. Thinking that Gil has lost his mind, Inez begins to show
interest in another male friend. Meanwhile Gil is obsessed with
Adriana, and as the couple visits the Moulin Rouge, they find
themselves transported to an even earlier, romantic period in French
history. Gil finds that Adriana has her own ideas about life, and he is
about to find true love in the unlikeliest of places.<br /><br />This is Allen in high gear and, though it does not necessarily rank
among his best, it certainly is a throwback to his vintage period of
Manhattan and the film that this will be most compared to The Purple
Rose of Cairo, with its similar combination of wistful fantasy,
storybook romance, and sophisticated comedy. You do wonder how Gil and
Inez could ever become a couple considering how much they bicker about
most everything. It&#x27;s also interesting how Allen uses a bit of sleight
of hand by focusing our attention on Gil and Adriana that we miss an
obvious connection. Such is love.<br /><br />Gil is a surrogate for Allen&#x27;s inner voice. (One could even picture a
younger Allen actually performing the role.) He is also a romantic in
contrast to Inez&#x27;s friends who are intellectuals. As for Paris, it
plays a supporting role as its landmarks are adoringly featured
throughout the film without detracting from the characters or story. It
is clear Allen is smitten with the City of Lights as he was with his
home base of New York City.<br /><br />There are some amusing scenes including the fate of a private
investigator hired to follow Gil and ends up caught up in a different
time running for his life. When Gil listens to old Cole Porter
recordings or sees Picasso paintings in a museum, the joke is that he
actually has met these men in real life! In another scene, Gil suggests
to a young director, Luis Bunuel, a film idea which is the plot to The
Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie that he will make many years later
(and win an Oscar). As Salvador Dali, Adrien Brody hams it up to great
effect in a brief scene.<br /><br />Sure Allen has made some good films recently like Match Point and Vicky
Cristina Barcelona, but it&#x27;s been a long while since he made anything
as imaginative, comedic, and romantic at the same time. Vive le Woody
Allen!
