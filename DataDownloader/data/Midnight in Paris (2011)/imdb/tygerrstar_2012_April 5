I failed to make it beyond the first 20 minutes of Midnight In Paris.
That miserable time was filled with a ever-increasing pity for such
hopelessly self-absorbed people. Sadly, every Woody Allen movie I have
seen, which is by no means all, has been populated exclusively with
characters devoid of the quality that I cherish in real people; a
recognition of some thing which is greater than themselves. Allen&#x27;s
characters always seem to follow the same, circular, shallow lives: It
starts with conflicting introspection, then false-awareness, always
followed by the deep, wallowing creep of a search for a self-induced
problem that would not have existed had their self-absorption not been
their best quality. Is Allen incapable of writing a character that has
faith? Surely he must have met a person in his life to draw upon,
SOMEWHERE, that was not endlessly bumping into other people&#x27;s psyches,
constantly wondering what is wrong with themselves! Well, maybe not...
