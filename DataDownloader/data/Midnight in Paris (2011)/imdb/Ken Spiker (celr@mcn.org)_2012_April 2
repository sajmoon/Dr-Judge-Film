This is Woody Allen at his most shallow and pretentious. As in all his
movies, the central character is Woody Allen himself, his anxieties,
his narcissism and his pretentiousness. Whether he plays the main
character himself or, as in this case, it is played by someone else,
it&#x27;s still the whiny, insecure, pathetic little pseudo-intellectual
that by all indications is who he really is. All other characters in
his movies are either clones of the Woody character or projections of
his neuroses. What&#x27;s most evident here is Woody&#x27;s tin ear for comedy.
Jokes fall flat, and worse, ruin any semblance of a mood or serious
emotion among the characters. Woody is, and probably will always be, a
frightened, insecure twelve year old boy with average intelligence who
is desperate to appear smarter than he is. For some people that&#x27;s
funny; for me, it&#x27;s just pathetic.<br /><br />Here we have Gil, (Owen Wilson) another Woody clone visiting Paris with
his dumb-blond wife and in-laws and a pedantic professor and his
equally pretentious and absurd wife. They are the epitome of East Coast
liberals: insufferably arrogant and intellectually competitive. Gil has
an added affliction besides his annoying nervous tics: he&#x27;s fascinated
by the Paris literary/art scene of the 1920s. In fact, he worships the
celebrities of that era the same way the the clueless slobs in &#x22;The
King of Comedy&#x22; worship their TV celebs. Gil is a groupie. He has
little feeling for art or writing but needs to somehow bask in the
reflected glory that knowing their names will add to his resume. <br /><br />Raymond Chandler once wrote in reference to the people who go to
Hollywood parties in hopes of rubbing elbows with celebrities: &#x22;They
are fearful of becoming the nobodies they never ceased to be.&#x22; That is
Gil. One night (who knows how?) he is transported back to the 1920s
where he is able to actually meet some of his heroes and heroines. This
could be a sort of magical moment, a romantic fantasy realized on the
screen. But in order for such a thing to work the audience must be
convinced of the reality of the transformation from one time to
another. Unfortunately Allen wrecks the suspension of disbelief at
every opportunity with the intervention of the nervous and supercilious
Gil who can&#x27;t seem to keep his mouth shut. The artists too, such as
Ernest Hemingway, Salvador Dali, Pablo PIcasso and Man Ray are merely
cartoon stereotypes, often spouting quotes from their own work, or
commenting on art in that phony-baloney way people in Woody Allen
movies are wont to do. These artistic celebs welcome Gil into their
midst, but you know right away the real artists these stereotypes are
based on wouldn&#x27;t have had anything to do with such an obvious loser. <br /><br />I could say more. Did I mention that there seems to be some kind of
weird colorization in some of the Parisian cityscapes? What&#x27;s that all
about? But I hope I&#x27;ve said enough to warn you off this pile of
sentimentality and drivel. Did I mention it&#x27;s not funny?
