Because I heard such good things about it. I ended up liking the bits
of music in the background, the look of Paris itself, and two of its
principal actresses--Rachel McAdams and Marion Cotillard, both of whom
played their roles to the hilt.<br /><br />But I had trouble with Owen Wilson&#x27;s habit of &#x22;slavishly&#x22; portraying
Woody Allen as the troubled central character who finds living in the
past is giving him the kind of nostalgic glow he craves. It takes the
full story to unwind before he finds a girl who likes to walk in the
rain alongside him and is also an eager devotee of Cole Porter&#x27;s
romantic music. Wilson&#x27;s imitation becomes tiresome before the first
scene is over and from then on I had a hard time just trying to enjoy
the film.<br /><br />Lots of name dropping goes on throughout the writer&#x27;s story, once
Wilson embraces the past at the magic hour of midnight. He meets F.
Scott Fitzgerald, Zelda, Picasso, Gertrude Stein (a bored looking Kathy
Bates), a macho Ernest Hemingway and a hilarious Salvador Dali adroitly
played by Adrien Brody. There&#x27;s a hit and miss aspect to the casting of
these celebrated characters but they provide the right comic relief.<br /><br />But something seems wrong from the start, mainly due to the wrong
casting of Owen Wilson as the protagonist. He seems as nervous and on
edge as his mentor (Mr. Allen), but watching him is an uncomfortable
experience.<br /><br />The film is slight but amusing, although hardly worthy of a Best
Screenplay Oscar.
