2011_June 4 
After reading reviews here, I have decided to watch this movie in
Barcelona. Although I really did not like the way trailer has been put
together, still wanted to give it a shot. Headed to a local cinema
showing it in original language. As the trailer was telling me like
&#x22;don&#x27;t go don&#x27;t waste your time and money&#x22;, it was beyond belief that
some people will rate this movie highly just because its an another
&#x22;master&#x22; !? piece from Woody Allen.<br /><br />First of all movie is not a romantic comedy, its not a science fiction,
its not a drama, its not a romantic drama nor its a comedy. Its a very
creative idea of time traveling put in a very boring interrelated
patterns.<br /><br />Acting is horrible as well. It could have been a great Hollywood comedy
if directed better with better comedy lines. There was a single line
which I laughed about Valium. That was something which they could have
used throughout the movie.<br /><br />If you are not into literature and art, do not waste your time.
