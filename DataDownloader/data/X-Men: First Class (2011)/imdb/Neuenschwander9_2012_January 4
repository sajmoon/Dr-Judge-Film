I&#x27;ve surfed this site many times, but never got an urge to subscribe to
write a review. X-Men: First Class broke this law. I just HAD to write
what a ghastly piece of crap this movie is.<br /><br />I won&#x27;t summarize the plot once again, since I see it is a habit of
most IMDb reviewers to do it, so it&#x27;s plain unnecessary, and I&#x27;ll skip
right away to the comments.<br /><br />I mean, this film just makes no sense at all.<br /><br />You watch the first 20 minutes and you go: &#x22;Hey, when is something
going to happen?&#x22;. You watch the second 20 minutes and you go:&#x22; Hey,
WHEN is something going to happen??&#x22;. You watch the third 20 minutes
and you go: &#x22;Hey, WHEN is SOMETHING going to happen???&#x22;. I&#x27;m not
kidding you, this movie lasts 80 minutes (a sign of pity from the
makers to make it that short?) and for the first 60, NOTHING happens.
You are just forced to listen to the unbearable, totally unrealistic
blabbering of 3 young retards trying to get 2 girls and to watch the
freaky nonsense of the guardian played by Magnito&#x27;s nemisis. A doll
here and there, a freak of some kind coming and going, a warm bath with
more nonsense scenes, a bitchy blue girl just got out of nowhere, pure,
plain nonsense.<br /><br />And THEN, when after 60 minutes of this torture, something actually
start to happen, it makes even less sense. The retards finally get
chased, you just hope they will get quickly murdered, in order to quit
listening to their fake, juvenile, scummish chatting about sex,
unlimited powers, and what else, but no, only one of them seems to give
us that relief, but then again... it starts all over again! Meanwhile
we discover that a single man in his 40&#x27;s or maybe 50&#x27;s can raise
another man with one hand and keep him hung against a wall for maybe
half a minute or so and then throw him across 2 rooms, can be hit by a
car at full speed, recover in a few minutes and then fight with a guy
in his early 20&#x27;s and prevail. All of this, just to lead to an ending
that is supposed to be creepy, but turns out to be only disgusting,
plus obviously totally senseless.<br /><br />Really, stay away from this piece of crap, it&#x27;s not even worth the
effort of clicking on the remote to turn it off.
