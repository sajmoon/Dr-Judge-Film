Fox can breath easy again because I think it&#x27;s safe to say the even the
extreme fanboys will be putting down their pitchforks and torches and
smile after seeing this amazing film. I know for a fact that general
audiences are going to love this movie. I know some fans can be
irrational and hold on to their hate because they expect certain things
they read in their books but I can&#x27;t seeing anyone being that
irrational when faced with a result that delivers what First Class
manages to deliver. It honestly is a genre-defining movie on a level
with any comic based film that has come before it. Everything in this
movie is exceedingly better than what Fox delivered in their last two
efforts with this franchise. Going back to the beginning and re-hiring
the guy that brought us those films was a splendid idea. The acting
here is superb and the dialogue is rich. Every character feels
absolutely believable no matter what abilities they have on display. No
cartoonish villains or cheese in sight, every side of the issue is
presented by people who believe they are the ones who are in the right
and the underlying message of tolerance and bigotry only add to the
depth of this film. If not a genre-defining movie than maybe it
redefines the comic book genre. It restores the sense of epic adventure
and grand-scale storytelling that we saw in X2. In fact, it perfectly
complements that great film and probably surpasses it.<br /><br />This film is to X2 what Godfather 2 was to the Godfather. Seriously,
First Class is an exceptional &#x22;flashback&#x22; look that links the best of
the X-Men trilogy to the past. Instead of DeNiro playing young Vito
Corleone we get James McAvoy as young Charles Xavier. Marlon Brando and
Patrick Stewart made their respective characters popular but both were
more fleshed out by incredible younger talent. I&#x27;m not placing the
X-Men film itself on a par with the Godfather but both have become
legendary in their particular genre. I am, however, saying McAvoy has a
bright future as a complex and talented actor. Just like the young cast
of Godfather 2 was legendary, the young cast of First Class has many
great days and projects ahead of them.<br /><br />Love this entire cast but Michael Fassbender delivers the best
performance with an amazing presence and command of the screen.
Everyone was extraordinary. What many expected indeed happens. By that
I mean every scene that Fassbender and McAvoy are in together
absolutely sing. It won&#x27;t surprise anyone to know that Kevin Bacon,
Oliver Platt and Jennifer Lawrence are superb in supporting roles but
Nicholas Hoult did stunning work as the Beast and deserves some love as
well. January Jones and Rose Byrne are hot as can be but aren&#x27;t just
simple eye candy. Sure, the story is compelling and the action is
amazing but the performances elevate this movie far above a common
summer flick.<br /><br />Movie of the year so far...
