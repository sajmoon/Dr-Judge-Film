I used to always watch this show and I thought all the characters were
hilarious. My favorite character disputes are the ones between Al and
Marcy.
Those are hilarious. Peggy, Kelly and Bud were also hilarious and one of my
favorite episodes was the one where Kelly and Bud are trying to get tickets
to a rock concert and keep losing their place and Al is tricked into having
sex with Peg through a fake radio contest. A classic episode. It also was
the show that got me into loving money because of the opening credits (Al
giving everybody in the family an &quot;allowance&quot; including the dog) I wish I
could catch them on reruns I know there is a station that plays them but
where I live they just don't have that channel or something. :( But I'm
glad
it was on as long as it was (10 great seasons)
