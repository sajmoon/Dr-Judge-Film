Ahhh.. I don&#39;t think there will ever be another show like this one. At
least not for me. I was only a kid when it was airing, but I never
missed an episode. It was like a family tradition to gather around the
living room and laugh at the Bundys.<br /><br />There may be fifty thousand television shows about dysfunctional
families, but none as dysfunctional as this one. And none nearly as
funny or original.<br /><br />I&#39;ve watched each episode at least 10 times and will watch each episode
10 more times and so on and so forth.<br /><br />This show is about a married couple that always poke fun at each other
and complain about how miserable they are, but they still love each
other. And their children are just horrible. The daughter is no smarter
than the dog (who sometimes &quot;talks&quot;) and always brings around strange
boys (who are even strange to her). And the son is the exact opposite,
nearly a genius and desperate to get some action for SOMEONE.<br /><br />Best comedy there will ever be. If you haven&#39;t seen this show then you
should definitely catch the reruns on FX. You don&#39;t even need to buy
the DVDs!
