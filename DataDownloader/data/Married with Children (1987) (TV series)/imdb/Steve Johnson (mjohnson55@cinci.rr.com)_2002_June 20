How could anyone hate this show?. Al Bundy is perhaps the funniest character
that has ever been on television period. His family and buddies are funny as
well, and all the goofy things that happens to Al is great too. (My favorite
episode is when Al gets a tip on a horse race, but he ends up getting all
these tickets. And ends up losing his license. Leaving him to ride a bicycle
to work because no one would take him and misses out on his race.) There are
so many funny episodes of this series I could not mention them all. The
Steve character was good, but he left before they could really develop him
any further, and Jefferson was every bit as funny as Al was. Of all the
comedies of the late 1980's to mid 1990's, Married with Children is by far
the best sit-com on television. Really there has not been another great
comedy like this one, but thank god that FX and several local stations still
show the re-runs nightly. If by some chance you've never seen this show,
watch it. Married is great.
