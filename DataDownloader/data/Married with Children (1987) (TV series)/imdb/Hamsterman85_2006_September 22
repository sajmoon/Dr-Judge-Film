granted, its funny, and was before my time, but the wit of the British
with the likes of dads army, father Ted, fawlty towers and vicar of
dibley really is far superior to any sitcom that the Americans have
ever put out (in my opinion). its definitely worth watching, but
depending on your sense of humour, you will either really love it or
just think its pretty good like i did.<br /><br />AL is definitely the star of the show and he is the most talented of
the actors. the others really are just side kicks compared with him.
but, in reality, he&#39;s no john cleese.<br /><br />ill rate it 7 out of 10
