Married... with children was always great until it's final episode in
1997.
The characters were the key element that gave success to
MWC.
Al Bundy was truly an American hero!, his lines are the best, always
pessimist. Peg is the lazy wife that spends the day in the couch watching
&quot;Oprah&quot;. Bud is the loser son that 's always trying to have a date, or
have
sex. He has rubber dolls under his bed.
Kelly is the hot dumb-blond daughter, she's sexy, her lines are dumb but
funny. Marcy is a great character, she has the funniest lines, and she
truly
hated Al. Jefferson was ok, as the lazy husband that depends on his wife's
job.
Steve Rhodes was funny, but left soon the series.
Anyways! If you want to laugh out loud, watch Married... With
Children.
