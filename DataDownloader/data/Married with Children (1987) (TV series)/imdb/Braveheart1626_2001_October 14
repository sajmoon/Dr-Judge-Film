The greatest show ever made, alongside &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Full House.&quot;  Really,
I think critics have critcized it but the men and women of the country love
it.  The whole cast is superb, except Mr.Darcy, who I hate.  Otherwise, the
rest is phenomenal, Ed O'Neill, Katey Sagal, Amanda Bearse and her first
husband Steve, David Faustino and Christina Applegate.
