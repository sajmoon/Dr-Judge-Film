This show is the greatest! It's also the very first sitcom
for
Fox. Let me tell you, this show had a pretty lame start. When you
look
at first season episodes now they look real dumb because we're
used
to Bud and Kelly was young adults and Jefferson. I mean, in the
pilot
episode Al wouldn't shut up about his juice. 
            Season 3 started all the ribaldness. But this old
broad
in Michigan didn't like the bra episode. Boy, what a whiner.<br /><br />Soon we all met Jefferson and the show picked up. I can't really
name
my favorite episodes because there are so many. I like the one
where
Al and Kelly shoot a movie about shoes, but it was entitled
&quot;Sheos&quot;,
thanks to Kelly. I also like the one where Al, Griff and
Jefferson
join the National Guard during a garbage strike. Yeah! Classic,
but
why did Fox eventually cancel this show? If there was any
justice,
it would still be on today. Like The Simpsons. I look forward to
the
day when Married...with Children get's a reunion show. It must!
All
the greats got ones. Beverly Hillbillies got one. Gilligan's
Island
got three! The Facts of Life got one not too long ago, Laverne
&amp;
Shirley got one--kind of, Get Smart had one, All in the Family
almost
had one, and Married...with Children must have one! There could
even
have been a Married movie! 
          Married couldn't have been done without Ed O'Neill.<br /><br />But imagine what it would've been like had Sam Kinison gotten the
role.
Everyone else in the cast was good too! Today, Katey Sagal is
the
voice of Leela on that Godawful show &quot;Futurama&quot;. The other
cast
members aren't doing much these days. <br /><br />In conclusion, this was a fine show. It must always be
remembered!
It, much like I Love Lucy, can be seen in reruns. <br /><br />--
