Back in 1987 there were three major networks ABC, CBS, and NBC well a
new station challenged them at that time yes your right it was Fox. Fox
had 3 main lineup core shows you know shows that launched a station.
Well they were 21 Jump Street, The Tracy Almond (Not sure about her
name) show and Married with Children. Who would have though a show
about a lowly shoe salesman would have done so good yet attract so much
flack? The story goes like this there was Al Bundy who was destined to
be a star football player till a bad leg injury stopped him dead in his
tracks. Well he thought he would rehab it and take a job as a shoe
salesman for the summer.... Well lets just say that job lasted 25
years. Yes you heard me right 25 years well he met a woman in
highschool named Peggy you know the typical red neck him and her hit it
off and they had 2 kids Bud and kelly. They moved into a nice 2 story
house in a neighborhood that didn't want them there. One of the people
who hated poor Al was their neighbor Marcy Rhodes who later became
Marcy &quot;Darcy&quot; Yes your right her first and last name rhyme. The one
thing she liked about Al was he had a job that her playboy husband
Jefferson refused to get well I won't get much into it I'll just talk
about other stuff about the show. One thing I remembered was that the
show got a lot of flack because the characters made constant fun of
large women and the occasional lesbian but besides that this show was
awesome I would recommend it to anyone who wants some old school long
live married with children.
