Look at the classic shows: Bewitched, All in The Family, Sanford and
Son, MASH and you must admit that these shows lost lots of steam in the
later episodes...Married with Children got BETTER IN THE LATER
EPISODES. They were way more over the edge and more funny than the
early seasons. <br /><br />I feel that Jefferson also made the show. I can&#39;t believe he was in the
later episodes of Happy Days (another show that tanked in the later
seasons).<br /><br />Married with Children will be considered one of the classic shows of
the 90s along with Seinfeld.
