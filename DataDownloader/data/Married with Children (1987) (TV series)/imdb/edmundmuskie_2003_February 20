Before there was Roseanne there was this underground comedy which
premiered
on FOX as one of it's first shows.  When the show first debuted it was on
three times on Sunday Night in April of 1987.  It was repeated twice after
it's premiere. There were so few people watching the show it was almost
cancelled after the first few episodes.<br /><br />It was controversial despite the fact that it was seen in so few homes.
Here was the plot:  Al Bundy was a working class shoe salesman living
outside of Chicago.  He had a wife who wore tacky clothing and never did
housework.  His daughter was nothing les of an aspiring floozy and his son
fancied himself a ladies man but never made it past nerd.<br /><br />So where was the controversy?  Peg was always wanting sex, Al refused to
constantly.  Their frustration was vented in countless sexual double
entendres.  They were always at odds with each other as well as their more
well to do neighbors.  They talked about sex all the time in the show.
The
parents did not care about the children and it was incredibly obvious.
The
family hardly let it out that they actually loved each other and it was
often questionable if they really loved ach other at all.<br /><br />The family as we saw was certainly dysfunctional and nothing like it's
more
perfect counterpart the Cosby Show.  The show was originally made to rebel
against the Cosby Show.  The show was originally entitled Not the Cosby
Show.  The Cosby Show has its place then so does this show.  The Cosby
Show
was perhaps what we should aspire to be.  Married with Children was what
we
are to a point anyway.<br /><br />The family was working class, unloving insulting and never seemed to have
fun.  None of them were happy and all of them held each other in contempt.
The show had a lot of flawed characters and initially the show was all
acting.  The difference between The Cosby Show and this show was that the
Cosby Show remained the same show throughout it's run.  This show went
from
being a brilliant working class sitcom to a dirty insulting pointless show
at the end of it's run.<br /><br />There is a place for the Cosby Show as it was something good to aspire to
but this was how it was.  David Garrison who played Steve Rhoades said
that
other shows would make you feel bad because their family was perfect.
This
show showed you how it was.  While my family was not this bad I could
identify with the arguments that this family got into the crazy father
figure in the form of my grandfather and relatives that are that loony as
well.<br /><br />In reality though this show was funnier than Cosby was.  This tried to
tell
jokes whereas Bill Cosby tried to make you feel good all of the time.  I
can
relate so little to that family and most of the jokes are incredibly
wholesome it really starts grating on your nerves how perfect the
Huxtables
are.  This may be the most important working class sitcom since all in the
family.  In many ways it was a precursor to the very good Roseanne, which
got on ABC a year after this show did.<br /><br />The one episode that stuck out to me was the one where Al had an overdue
library book.  That one is a classic.  I also liked the one where people
thought Al was selling his car for $4.00 The first five seasons of this
show
were brilliant from 1987-91.  The next three years were very good from
1991-94.  For it's last three years I think they just had the show on
because FOX wouldn't know what to do without Married. with Children off
the
air.  It was the only show that was on since the networks beginning.<br /><br />The show in its last years just became a sorry excuse for a bunch of fat
lady jokes and stupid sexual references all the time from Al to every girl
around.  And in the end they just cut at each other and it wasn't funny
anymore it was just insults.  I wish Al had won a little more instead of
being a loser all of the time.  I also like Steve Rhoades a little more
than
I did Jefferson D'Arcy.  If you watch this show make sure it is one of the
earlier ones those are the best ones.  In the earlier ones they featured
so
little of the children and those were much funnier.  Christina Applegate
is
trying so hard to get away from her Kelly Bundy image it will be
interesting
to she if she will.<br /><br />Anyways this is a classic show.  Still this is one of the best shows on
FOX,
that's not saying much but it is.  I still watch this show in reruns when
it
is not one of the idiotic later episodes and I will probably like it for a
long time to come.
