There are only 4 sitcoms I can think of that truly changed TV, All in the
Family, Soap, Seinfeld, and Married with Children.
What they all have in common besides great raw humor was Guts and a lot of
it. So what upset me the most and I'm sure all of you feel the same way was
the way it ended, No final episode! It was just canceled! Just like Soap was
in 1981. 
Married with Children made the FOX network!!<br /><br />It was on for 10 years 259 episodes and it was FOX's first hit show and was
FOX's cash cow for years and they had the nerve to cancel it without a final
goodbye.
So what I would love to see is for it to be brought back as a movie!<br /><br />A theatrical movie on the big screen. I believe it would be a great movie
for someone like the Ferrelly bros. or the Coen bros. I always thought it
should either be a movie (rated R naturally) or on cable so it can really
let loose.<br /><br />I mean its a no brainier! Look at the Vacation movies, the Bundys are way
more hilarious then the Griswalds!
$100 million box office just waiting to happen!
But what ever happens PLEASE at least give it a real final
ending.
