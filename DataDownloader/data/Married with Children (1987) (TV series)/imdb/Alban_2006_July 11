Married... With Children started out as one of the funniest and
freshest shows on TV, and it was FOX&#39;s first real hit. Just about
everything from the first few seasons was gold. My picks for best
episodes: <br /><br />1. The 1987 Christmas special where Santa Claus died <br /><br />2. The game show where Al and Peg pretended to be newlyweds <br /><br />3. The one where Al was actually trying to get Peg pregnant and it was
killing him. The last 5 minutes of that one were particularly funny.<br /><br />Around the second season, they started the show with a picture of Al
smiling back at the audience as if he was spaced out watching TV. They
soon replaced this with him in a more familiar grumbling pose. But I
thought the &quot;happy and distant&quot; was more appropriate and funnier. I
can&#39;t find that picture anywhere.<br /><br />Towards the end the humor got stale. I suppose they had different
writers. They lost track of the original formula of making it a war
between the men and the women. Al and Steve would team up against Peg
and Marcie. There were never really any winners. If one of them is
unhappy, they made sure everyone was miserable.<br /><br />Also, they really lost count of how many years they were on. In the
episode where Al entered the Olympics for old people, the announcer
said, &quot;Bet you thought Al was going to let the old guy win. Well, then
you haven&#39;t been paying attention for the last seven years.&quot; However
when this aired, Married&#133; With Children had been on for a little over 5
years. Toward the end, I think they said it was on for 14 years, when
in reality it was on from 1987 to 1997. I don&#39;t know why they were off
so much.<br /><br />But even the last season wasn&#39;t all that bad. I watched every single
episode.
