Poor Al Bundy. He has a wife he hates, a daughter who&#x27;s a dimwit, and a
son who thinks he is cool but really isn&#x27;t. Al the lowly Shoe Salesman
still manages to keep it together even though he really wants to go
insane.<br /><br />Married with Children is one of my favorite television shows only
behind Seinfeld.<br /><br />The sexist jokes were funny however later in the show they focused more
at poking fun at women which I found to be a bit much. However I did
enjoy the fat jokes and I happen to be a heavy individual.<br /><br />Some of the best jokes involved Al poking fun at Marcy their next door
neighbor. &#x22;I have a strange yearning for some melons, and a plucked
chicken.&#x22; Great joke! <br /><br />Most of the newer episodes were not nearly as funny but still happened
to maintain the shows charm. Many major changes may have hurt the show
such as Steve&#x27;s departure and the introduction of Jefferson both of
them were still good. Seven perhaps was the biggest blow to the series
and was a character that should have been more comedy relief. Al and
Buck are my favorites of the show.<br /><br />Overall a great show and one of the classics.
