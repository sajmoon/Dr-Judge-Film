Married... With Children (1987) TV Series<br /><br />This show constantly fills you with laughs! It is about your typical
American family- and if you are thinking The Brady Bunch, than you are
wrong! Married With Children is absolutely the opposite. This show focuses
on a dysfunctional family that is made up of Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill), the
father of the family, Peggy (Katey Sagal), Ed's ditsy wife, Kelly (Christina
Applegate), their partying daughter, and Bud (Dave Faustino), their son who
can't seem to score with any chicks. Al Bundy, played by Ed O'Neill,is the
funniest TV character I can think of. Katey Sagal is hilarious and Christina
Applegate is talented and funny, as is Dave Faustino. This show has some
wonderful and outrageous episodes that are sure to make you laugh every
time.<br /><br /> This show is sure to offend goodie two shoes-sort of families, but to most
of us, this is an absolute hilarious treat! This show is a classic to be
enjoyed by everyone and anyone! 10/10.
