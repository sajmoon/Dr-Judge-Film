Married With Children is the greatest show ever, along with The Wonder
Years.  One average episode contains more laughs than every episode of
Full
House, Saved By the Bell, Out of This World, and the Brady Bunch combined.
Unhappily Ever After is such a rip-off of this show because the writers
are
the same, it's pitiful.  Married With Children is legendary, The Emmys are
a
joke.  Ed O'Neill should've won an Emmy.
