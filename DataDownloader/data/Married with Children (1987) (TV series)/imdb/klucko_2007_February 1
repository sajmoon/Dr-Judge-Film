This was truly a unique show. It was also the funniest sitcom I have
ever seen - unlike almost all sitcoms, it was hilarious throughout
every single show. And unlike almost all sitcoms, there almost never
was a &quot;moral to the story,&quot; (which writers seem to want to put into all
their shows).<br /><br />By exaggerating various character-types, the writers of this show were
able to parody American life - and especially, parody the theme that
formed the basis of family-based sitcoms up to that time - that
conflicts, especially family conflicts, can be resolved within 1/2
hour. During the 1980&#39;s, there were some popular sitcoms that were
supposed to be funny, but really were not - especially Family Ties. It
mocked a lot of questions that were brought up in TV sitcoms the
previous three decades. By using sleazy characters, and extremely
obviously unrealistic situations(a shoe salesman is able to afford a
three-story house in the suburbs, but never has food around the house,
the husband never wants to have sex with his wife, an extremely
dimwitted daughter) to deal with absolutely idiotic topics each
episode, the writers of the show were able to bring parody to it&#39;s
highest level possible - in terms of quality and effect this exceeds
anything that is considered &quot;highbrow&quot; humor. <br /><br />Married...with Children was so good, in fact, that it has raised
expectations as to what is an acceptable level of humor. Excepting
sports and education channels, I have watched very little since it went
off the air.
