Yes, the humor on this show was sometimes tasteless but it's still a
hilarious satire of family dysfunction and life's everyday problems. 
Everyone on the show was perfect for the roles that they played and watching
this show is a very good way to be able to laugh about your own problems. 
It always makes me laugh out loud when I watch this show.
