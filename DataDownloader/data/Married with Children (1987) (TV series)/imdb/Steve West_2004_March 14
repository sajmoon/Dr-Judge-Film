&quot;Married... with Children&quot; just has something about it that makes it
hilarious, it takes the basic premise of the family and suburban life,
and puts the family from the hell in there and just lets them
constantly rip on each other. It&#39;s a testament to the basic formula of
the show that it lasted so long, and was still actually funny right up
until the last season (with an overweight, balding Ed O&quot;Neil and kids
old enough to have left the house by now). The casting was perfect
(except for newcomer Jefferson in my opinion) and the character of Ed
was what really made the show. The opening song fitted the show
perfectly too. Anyone who has watched the show probably has &quot;Married...
with Children&quot; moments to this day when they open a fridge with nothing
but an empty milk carton in the door or have thoughts about installing
an antenna on the roof.<br /><br />&quot;Married... with Children&quot; is probably one of America&#39;s greatest TV
exports, it was a privilege to be growing up when this was on every
week and I wish all the castmembers continued success.
