Married...with Children was a great show about an unloving family.The head
of the family Al Bundy was played by Ed O'Neill,
who was a women's shoes salesman and
who didn't want to have sex with his wife.Katey Sagal was playing Peggy
Bundy, the red head mother and the wife, who got her best tips from TV.The
son Bud Bundy was played by David Faustino, who wanted the girls but didn't
get them too often.Christina Applegate played the daughter Kelly Bundy, who
had the look, but
didn't have the brains.The smartest in the Bundy family was Buck the
dog.Amanda Bearse played the neighbour Marcy Rhoades D'Arcy, whose
relationship with Al wasn't that great.Marcy's husband Steve Rhodes was
played by David Garrison, but after he left, the new man was Jefferson
D'Arcy, played by Ted McGinley.
The show had many jokes about sex and fat women.The show had good ten
years.
