Quantum Leap is the best show that was ever made, but Married With
Children,
had to be the second best.  My favorite character in the show, is Bud. His
constant struggle to get laid is great, and it is especially funny, when
he
gets made fun of by Kelly because of his &quot;rubber woman&quot; Kelly Bundy (
Christina Applegate) is so gorgeous!! Al Bundy of course is the man.
Jefferson was much better than Steve. Two funniest Jefferson moments: The
first one was in &quot;The Wedding Show&quot;, when he comments on how much he hates
Marcy's clock, and how he tried to kill it. The second one, is in &quot; TRA
something something, spells tramp&quot;, when he says that he will dance for
Marcy, but his dancing is an art and not to be degrated by his mother in
law
&quot; That's right, shake that moneymaker over here for mommy&quot;
