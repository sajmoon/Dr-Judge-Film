First a little aside: I usually don&#x27;t like family sitcoms created for a
large audience, Married with Children and The Simpsons are about the
only ones I can watch, so when someone suggested Modern Family to me I
was naturally very skeptical. And I was largely right, because even
though it touches on subjects that are quite modern (gay couples and
adoption), at the core its comedy/relevance/morals/ethics are immensely
conservative exactly like 99,99% of the other sitcoms. Simply the fact
that all three families only have one earner and that none of the adult
women work out of the house proves my point, but there are far more
hyper-conservative aspects to it, only the slightly edgy humor and the
gay couple keep it from drowning in the 13-in-a-dozen sitcom sewer.<br /><br />Now back to Married with children, which I wanted to see again after
seeing Modern Family (and not only because of Ed O&#x27;Neill, but also
because I wanted a comparison), a sitcom 20 years older (!) than the
above example, yet it has far edgier comedy, is still more relevant to
todays average family, is morally and ethically far more challenging
and adventurous, and makes much better use of the &#x27;bad example&#x27; as a
teaching tool.<br /><br />Hence the title: a pure family-sitcom that isn&#x27;t aimed at some niche in
society, that has only really been superseded by The Simpsons in more
than 20 years (which isn&#x27;t entirely pure since it&#x27;s animated), is like
a wine that ripes with age, it actually gets better as it leaves more
and more pretenders in the dust. 10/10
