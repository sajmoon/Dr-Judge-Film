I agree with everyone who have posted comments on Married...with
Children.This is the funniest tv show in the history of t.v. I miss
it.Even
the episodes with Seven were funny.Every episode is a classic of situation
comedy in my opinion. I watch it three times a night,twice on FX and at
midnight on FOX.I've memorized just about all of Al's lines.It really
stinks
that it isn't on anymore.Oh well there's always reruns.The only complaint
I
have are the dumb spinoff episodes.At least they got rid of
them.
