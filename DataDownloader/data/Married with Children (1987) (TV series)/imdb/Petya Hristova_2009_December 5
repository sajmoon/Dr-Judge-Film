The only reason why I can&#x27;t give 10 points to &#x22;Married with Children&#x22;
is the fact that the show was a different show in the beginning,
compared to the later seasons. After season 5 it became just too over
the top for me. But seasons 1-4 were perfect. Married With Children
from the earlier seasons is a totally different show than Married With
Children from the later ones. I guess that&#x27;s what happens to all
long-running sitcoms - they change way too much. In my opinion seasons
1-4 are the best, but that&#x27;s my personal opinion.<br /><br />&#x22;Married with Children&#x22; has lots of good and funny moments unlike most
American sitcoms. It is my second all-time favorite sitcom (First place
is ALF, and third is a tie between Roseanne and Grace Under Fire). It&#x27;s
also witty and satiric.<br /><br />As summary I just say that &#x22;Married with Children&#x22; is a great show, but
I really like the earlier seasons like the first 4. The show started
going downhill after that and season 7 was the worst of all seasons
(hate that kid Seven).<br /><br />I&#x27;ll definitely buy seasons 1, 2, 3 and probably 4 on DVD. Not so sure
about seasons 5-11.
