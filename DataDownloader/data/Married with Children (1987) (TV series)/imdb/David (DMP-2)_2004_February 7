Married....With Children was such a great show. I still don&#39;t
understand why it was cancelled, even though it was on for 10 years.
For myself, it was one show that I never got sick of and never will. I
can watch re-runs of this show forever, I can never get sick of any
episode of this show. I still can&#39;t believe it never received any
Emmys. Before this show came out, the closest in quality was &quot;All in
the Family&quot;, but even that show has some episodes that do bore me after
constant viewing. Ed O&#39;Neil created probably the most hilarious TV
character ever. It&#39;s unfortunate that he&#39;s become almost typecast as Al
Bundy. Even in the movie &quot;Dutch&quot;, which was an OK film, he plays a very
Al Bundy like role. The character of Al Bundy is one we can all relate
to, he appeals to all the wrongs that either we are to chicken or
refuse to do and it makes us laugh, because Al Bundy has the guts and
care free ability to do it all. Although many of these things we may
not agree with, but we&#39;ve thought about them. The other characters of
Peggy, Bud, Kelly, Marci, Steve, Jefferson and all the rest, all were
excellent and brilliantly complemented the characteristics of Al. I
wonder when if or whenever this will have a reunion. I also wonder if
its too bold for Nick at Nite or TV Land, although they did start
Roseanne recently. More DVD collections must be made. Again
Married....With Children is the Greatest show ever created. Until
Family Guy came along.
