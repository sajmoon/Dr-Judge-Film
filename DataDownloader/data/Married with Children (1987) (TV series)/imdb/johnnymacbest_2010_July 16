No sitcom has ever been funnier, raunchier, and morally sexist such as
Married...with children, a show that, along with it&#x27;s titular anti-hero
AL Bundy, became renowned in America and the world all over. With
constant jib-jabs among the dysfunctional Bundy family, this show will
have you laughing on the floor in minutes. Married with Children is not
for the faint of heart, nor does it provide any moral/intellectual
value. What it does is make you laugh out loud hard on the floor.
Nothing more, nothing less. And it&#x27;s got hot chicks to boot; you can&#x27;t
argue with the amount of babes you get to see. Classic in every since
of the word.
