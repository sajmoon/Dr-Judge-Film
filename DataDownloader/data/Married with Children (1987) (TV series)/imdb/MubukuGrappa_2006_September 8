What else can I add to the magnificent Al Bundy &amp; Co., about whom
everything possible has already been said? Just that my life would
never be the same again, since the day Al Bundy happened to me! <br /><br />Al Bundy marriage, just like a carriage: Al Bundy gives me company in
my lonely, desolate evenings and carries me to the land of dream every
night. Al Bundy is my hero, my savior, my messiah. I do not care how
biased Fox 11 news is; I do not give a damn as to how many paranoid TV
shows, such as &quot;Cops&quot;, Fox 11 broadcasts; as long as my hero, Al Bundy,
is with Fox 11, I&#39;m with Fox 11.<br /><br />Al Bundy: What a guy! Who won&#39;t like to be like him. He is my hero. Al
Bundy, the last American hero. <br /><br />Al Bundy loves Psycho Dad. Actually, he is the Psycho Dad without the
gun, the Dad who would have taken Peggy Bundy out, had it not been a
federal offense! Al Bundy overshadows Hondo, or even the &quot;great&quot; Al
Capone. Al Bundy is Chicago the windy city, and Al Bundy is what sitcom
is. What superb dialogs, what acting, what facial expressions, what a
depiction of a decadent family. Al Bundy Show: the greatest American TV
show ever and possibly the greatest show on earth!<br /><br />Al Bundy: It&#39;s like what Van Gogh said &quot;Paris is Paris; there is but
one Paris&quot;; the same can be said of Al Bundy.<br /><br />God bless Al Bundy. May his tribe increase! <br /><br />__________ ____________ ______________ ______________<br /><br />Postscript written in sadness: I read that the real Al Bundy (there
ain&#39;t nobody named Ed O&#39;Neill nowhere; it&#39;s only Al Bundy) is a nice,
decent, soft-spoken gentleman; what a let down!
