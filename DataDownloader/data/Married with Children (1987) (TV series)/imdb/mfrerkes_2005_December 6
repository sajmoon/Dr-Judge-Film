Almost every great sit-com is regarded as such because it pushed the
envelope and took TV comedy into previously uncharted territory.
&quot;Married With Children&quot; certainly did that, becoming one of TV's
longest running sit-coms in the process. The show began at a time when
&quot;The Cosbys&quot; dominated the ratings and many people were growing weary
of its sugary-sweet portrayal of family life. Al, Peg, Kelly, and Bud
were the perfect antidote. Their characters were very easy to relate
with for most people who grew up in a dysfunctional, lower-middle class
family. Al's shoe store stories were the best. Kelly and Bud's verbal
jousting was classic. Peg's inept and lazy approach to life was as
pathetic as it was funny. Even the secondary characters like Marcy,
Steve, and Jefferson all added immensely to the show's unique
character.
