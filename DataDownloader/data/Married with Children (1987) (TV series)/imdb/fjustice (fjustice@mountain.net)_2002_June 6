What else can you say about Ed O'Neill, Katey Sagal, Christina Applegate,
or
David Faustino? Or as the world, including me, and I still do it at times,
has started calling them Al, Peggy, Kelly, and Bud Bundy. THEY RULE!!! Bud,
Kelly, and Peggy did okay, but as we all know, it was Al who stole the
show.<br /><br />He had some sorry, nosy, won't leave alone neighbors too. Amanda Bearse was
Marcy D'Arcy/Rhoades, David Garrison was Steve Rhoades, and Ted McGinly was
Jefferson D' Arcy. Boys, MWC really was the greatest show on television.
And
one of the most famous scene's:<br /><br />Peggy: &quot;Then it's your fault!&quot;<br /><br />Al: &quot;From the minute I said I do!&quot;<br /><br />(A TISKET, A TASKET, CAN PEGGY MAKE A BASKET)<br /><br />My favorite, Al Goes To The Dogs, is hilarious. And it was also one of the
most popular one's.<br /><br />Anyhow, I will DEFINANTLY GIVE THIS: Because it deserves
it:<br /><br />10 outa 10<br /><br />Married... With Children: Thanks for the good laughs and comedy! I loved
it!
