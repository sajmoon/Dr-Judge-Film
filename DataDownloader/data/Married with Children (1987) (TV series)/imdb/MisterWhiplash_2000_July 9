I really liked this show.  They shouldn't of cancelled this show (but come
to think of it the Bundys were getting old) because despite some stupid
jokes, this was funny (and where else are you going to see a sitcom with a
family that has the same name of a serial killer).  Not always bright, but
always entertaining.
