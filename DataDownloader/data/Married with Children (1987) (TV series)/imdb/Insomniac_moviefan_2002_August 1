&quot;Married...With Children&quot; has to be one of the greatest comedy series in
history of life! The show was hilarious, the chemistry between the actors
is
amazing. This show rocks!!! In fact, this show started all the family
problem thing, before the Simpsons. This show is heavily underrated, and
deserves more recognition and respect.
Ed O'Neill was the star of the series as Al Bundy, the shoe salesman. Al
attributes all his problems and failures to Peg, his wife (Katey Sagal). To
make it more complicated, Al has 2 children, Bud -the loser son, and Kelly
-the sexy hot blonde that has no brain, and they create new problems for
Al.
Al Bundy has to be one of the greatest heroes in Television History, he's
always in trouble and behind the wall with terrible situations but he
manages to keep his good sense of humor. The sex jokes were hilarious,
they'll making you laugh off your socks.
Every character was perfectly ellaborated, even Buck the dog.<br /><br />I agree, Jefferson (Ted McGinley) is a great buddy to Al but that buddy
relationship left a lot to wish. Marcy (Amanda Bearse) is very funny, and
she can get Al out of his mind.<br /><br />&quot;Married...&quot; was cancelled for 2 reasons. 1) The show didn't work as it use
to from season 1 to 5. Then it went down, jokes were lame, Al was the main
character not leaving space in the show for the rest of the cast. 2) The
cast, and the wrtiers tried to make &quot;Married...&quot; like the rest of the hit
seaons of the time, forgeting about the original &quot;Married...&quot; storyline,
and
it's own sense of humor. I was very sad after the last episode. I think
that
this series deserved a better ending, and this final episode came very
late.
I'm sure that the series had more potential in the end, I just don't know
why it changed that much, it wasn't &quot;Married&quot; in the end, the show seemed
like a cartoon.<br /><br />What makes this show a winner, it's the actors, and the great chemistry
that
exist between them. The plot and jokes were damn hilarious.
You can't ask for more, watch &quot;MARRIED...WITH CHILDREN&quot; to witness one of
the funniest shows ever, one of the best sitcoms in history, and the best
&quot;problem family&quot; show uncensored. No wonder how it lasted for 11 years,
this
show is on the top10 of all time best sitcoms. 10/10
