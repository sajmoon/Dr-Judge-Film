I've just had the misfortune to watch this show, and it's not an
experience
I ever want to repeat. Appaling predictable jokes that aren't funny, with
canned laughter going along syncophatically, and some audience whooping
whenever anyone comes on screen or there's any sexual reference. Is this
the
pinacle of American humour? If so, I really worry about the state of your
country.
