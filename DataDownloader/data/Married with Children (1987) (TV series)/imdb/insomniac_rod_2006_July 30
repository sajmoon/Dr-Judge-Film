After season 4 this sitcom looked like it had potential to become one
of the best comedies ever created. Sadly, in the mid 90&#39;s &quot;Married...&quot;
turned into a cheesy black comedy with Al Bundy as a super hero. Still
, the series ended decently and still is considered one of the best.<br /><br />&quot;Married...&quot; has reached a t.v. series cult status and has generated
thousands of passionate fans. It&#39;s really impressive to see how this
sitcom has left it&#39;s own trade on t.v. history. None other comedy like
this has been produced. This is a sui generis t.v. show. Al Bundy is a
hero for many people and one of the most beloved t.v. characters in
history. <br /><br />The series made fun of feminism, white trash, an economic lower class,
sex, homosexuality, machismo, etc. but in a black comedy way. The first
seasons were more raw and with heavy sex jokes that were later toned
down. The creativity of the original writers was excellent and set a
way to black comedy t.v. series. <br /><br />The cast was simply great, there was an excellent chemistry between all
of them. Ed O&#39;Neill and Katey Sagal are easily the best married couple
on t.v. They could insult each other but you knew there was a lot of
love and sexual tension between them. Both are excellent actors and
it&#39;s beyond reason why they didn&#39;t receive an Emmy for their
performances. Amanda Bearse did a great job as Al&#39;s number one enemy
but you could feel that both actors had excellent chemistry between
them. The same goes for Bearse and Ted McGingley, an underrated comedy
actor. David Faustino and Christina Applegate were excellent in their
roles and their brother-sister relationship is hilarious. <br /><br />Please, watch the re-runs of this show because it&#39;s a part of pop
culture. The lines of the show are pure genius and it displays a
magnificent use of sarcasm and irony. The show did get cheesier by the
last seasons but still it was funny. Too bad that there isn&#39;t a real
ending to this legendary and beloved show. <br /><br />Thanks &quot;Married...&quot; for growing with me and always managed to make me
smile (or lough out loud) when I really needed it. It&#39;s my personal
favorite sitcom of all time but objectively, this is one of the best
comedy series ever created.
