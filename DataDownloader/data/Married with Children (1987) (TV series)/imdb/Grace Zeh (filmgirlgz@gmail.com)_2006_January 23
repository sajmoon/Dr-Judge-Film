&quot;MARRIED WITH CHILDREN,&quot; in my opinion, is an absolute FOX classic! I&#39;m
not sure I&#39;ve seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. One of my
favorites would have to be the one where a protest breaks out in the
shoe store. I liked it when a mishap occurred. I always laughed at
that. Even though I liked Ted McGinley, it would have been nice if all
the main characters stayed with the show throughout its entire run. It
seems that no one stays with a show throughout its entire run. Everyone
always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular,
the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very
strong. In conclusion, I hope it stays on FX for fans of the show to
see for a long time.
