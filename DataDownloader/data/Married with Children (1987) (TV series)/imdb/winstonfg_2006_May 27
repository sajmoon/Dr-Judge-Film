I feel almost sorry for Ed O&#x27;Neill, who never again hit the heights he
did in as Al Bundy, the funniest character I ever saw on American TV.<br /><br />As an ex-pat who&#x27;d grown up with Monty Python, Till Death Us Do Part,
and Steptoe &#x26; Son, I was wondering by 1987 (by which time I&#x27;d lived in
the US/Canada for 8 years) if North Americans actually had a sense of
humour. Sit-comes were contrived, moralistic and formulaic; so much so
that people were actually watching Benny Hill(!) for relief.<br /><br />Thank God for Married...With Children; a sit-com that finally proved
worthy of the name. Raunchy, anarchistic and funny; with enough sexy
girls for us guys and (I suspect) sufficient male humiliation for 90&#x27;s
women. At long last we had a non-cartoon show that really poked fun at
&#x22;America the Beautiful&#x22;. And nobody preaching.<br /><br />By the final seasons it was showing signs of wear, but nothing&#x27;s
perfect. I sincerely hope the next MWC is out there but, unfortunately,
haven&#x27;t seen much sign of it yet; people seem happier with the safety
of &#x27;Friends&#x27;.
