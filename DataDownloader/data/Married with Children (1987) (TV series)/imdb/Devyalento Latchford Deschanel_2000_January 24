Married...With Children was the best sitcom ever to be devised. A flawed
family and their troubles in life is one of the simplest yet most effective
plotlines in comedy history (Roseanne being a good example). But
Married..With Children was so much better, with likeable characters, raunchy
and risque jokes and the craziest live studio audience
ever!<br /><br />The cast of Married...With Children really made it shine. Ed O'Neill was
brilliant as the downtrodden Al, while Katey Sagal was just perfection as
his gorgeous yet monstrous wife Peg. Christina Applegate exuded the right
amount of sex appeal as the beautiful yet frankly stupid Kelly, while David
Faustino constantly made you feel sorry for Bud, who never had a woman when
he needed one. David Garrison and Ted McGinley were great as Steve and
Jefferson, 1st and 2nd husbands of the crazed Marcy, played with class by
Amanda Bearse. A host of recurring supporting players (Griff, Bob Rooney,
etc) helped to make Married..With Children the sparkling show it
was.<br /><br />The show lost itself a bit in it's final season, but that was acceptable
after 10 years of fantastic comedy. married...With Children was one of the
few sitcoms that deserved to stay on our screens forever. The Bundys will be
missed.
