Just awful and gross, badly acted, depressing, with small plots of a
typical, tiny-minded world. The people in charge of thinking up jokes
or writing for the show were obviously lazy, unimaginative people;
surviving only on the fact that &#39;if it&#39;s on television, they&#39;ll watch
it.&#39; Even the theme song is slow and awful, even the title. The father
resents his wife and kids. The daughter is promiscuous, and the
trashy-dressing mother encourages it. The scheming mullet-wearing son
is smug and rude to his sister. You can see the jokes coming a mile
away.<br /><br />And I&#39;m not complaining because of that controversial episode where
they dressed that old man up as a woman; I haven&#39;t seen it. I&#39;ve seen
two episodes in my life; hopefully I&#39;ll never be placed in a situation
where I&#39;ll endure some more of it.<br /><br />The humour is obvious. What kind of audience do the writers appeal to?
The fact that the show ran for 10 years is depressing, because it shows
that people don&#39;t want to see clever or original work- that sort of
thing scares them or makes them feel dumb! No, they want to see summit
that they can easily understand; something thats been done but they
know what to expect of it and know whats happening. The Bundy family
are a gross family that do not seek to better themselves or help other
people; its no wonder that this whole production was created by FOX. <br /><br />Oh, and interesting note about the controversial episode- a lady tried
to organize a boycott against it, which accidentally increased the
shows ratings. The creators of the show sent her a fruit basket every
Christmas as a way to say &#39;thank you.&#39; How small, eh? Not funny- its
ignorant and small minded- those creators sound like right jerks to me-
and these are the fellows who controlled the show.
