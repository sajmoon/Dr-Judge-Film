MWC is a comedy-classic. But you really do need an open mind to accept
it as a classic. MWC is totally absurd, it compares to nothing. <br /><br />The characters are stereotypes. Al Bundy is a low-paid shoe salesman in
ill fitting polyester pants. Al is married to Peggy, red haired and
buxom, being everything but a housewife. Daughter Kelly is blond, sexy
and dumb and her brother Bud is perpetual in his puberty.<br /><br />The first time I saw it I was confused...so NOT-American as we knew at
the time, personified in the Huxtable-family. It was such a relief,
foul mouthing and b*tching each other, jokes so lame that it was
hilarious, completely over the top! <br /><br />For the sake of sanity, the Bundy&#x27;s have neigbours. Superficially they
are sane but under the vanish of a decent middle-class-couple they are
just as demented as The Bundy&#x27;s are. David Garrison is very much missed
as neighbor Steve in my opinion.<br /><br />Yesterdaynight I saw an episode, don&#x27;t ask me which one but I saw it at
last 5 times before. I saw the jokes coming from light years away and I
laughed again.<br /><br />If you love an anti-pc comedy, which is sexist, randy and occasionally
extremely lame, full of stereotypes machinegunning you with one liners
and sometimes great dialog, this is for you. It was for me for oh-so
many years.<br /><br />Its not the greatest comedy ever but it is in the top 10 for sure
(number one for me is Father Ted!)<br /><br />Thank you for reading and may Al live Forever!
