OK, what's to say about this underappreciated masterpiece of a sitcom that
hasn't already been said?  Ed O'Neill IS Al Bundy in a way that most of us
aren't even ourselves in our own lives.  The series wore out its welcome
long before its end, but its prime years were incredible.  I enjoy my life
so much more knowing that I could be Al Bundy, but I'm not!
