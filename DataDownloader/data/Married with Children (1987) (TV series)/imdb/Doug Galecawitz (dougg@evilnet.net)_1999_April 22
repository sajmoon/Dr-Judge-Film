This is simply perfect. I have around two hundred episodes on tape. 4
Married With Children comic books. Every Phone patrol commercial with Ed
O'Niell. Every movie on video with Ed O'Niell including Delverence. However
I do not have a NO'MAAM shirt which I'm looking for. My favorite episode
(which just coincidentally happens to be Ed O'Niell's favorite) is the first
one Bubba Smith appeared on. Entitled &quot;ALL NIGHT SECURITY DUDE&quot; In which Al
must face his old nemesis Spare Tire Dixon in order to regain possession of
his sacred championship trophy. Great writing, great acting, lots of raunchy
jokes, and hooters aplenty. Let's Rock!
