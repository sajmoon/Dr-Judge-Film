<br /><br />Married With Children has to be by far the funniest show ever. Everything
Al
says is funny. The fact that Peg does absolutely nothing to p**s Al off is
funny. Kelly being the stupidest person on television is funny. Jefferson
and Bud are the biggest losers, but still make me laugh. And the
conversations and fights between Al and Marcy are comedy at it's best. If
you dont watch this show WATCH IT! Weeknights on FOX at 10:00 and
10:30.
