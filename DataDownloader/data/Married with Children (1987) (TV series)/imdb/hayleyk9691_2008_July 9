I watch Married...With Children every week at 6:30 -- and even though
we&#39;ve might&#39;ve seen on episode three times already -- it doesn&#39;t
matter. This show is so hilarious that you&#39;d think that it might&#39;ve
taken a miracle to come up with all of Al&#39;s jokes on Marcy to Kelly&#39;s
ditzy reactions to the simplest thing (take Where&#39;s Waldo for those
who&#39;ve seen that one!) Simple description: the Bundy are like the
hillbillies in a normal Chicago neighborhood. Al hates his life, his
career selling shoes to fat women who think they&#39;re really a size 4,
and anything else he can think of. He makes fun of his neighbor Marcy,
calling her a chicken and making chicken remarks to her. Peggy is his
redheaded, couch-sitting wife who eats bonbons and watches Oprah all
the time. Their kids can&#39;t get any worse. Kelly is a living example to
the term &quot;dumb blonde&quot; while Bud is just a desperate fellow looking for
a girl to mess around with.<br /><br />What makes this show so funny is how the Bundy family functions. It&#39;s a
shame that this show stopped when I was only 6, but who cares as long
as they keep the Bundy family living via TV!
