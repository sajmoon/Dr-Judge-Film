Married...with Children is just great. There is some rude humor about women
(Peggy and Marcy) and sex (Bud and Kelly). The Bundy's act like an asocial
family, they are rude, violent. Sometimes they steal. This kind of humor is
what I like. But whatever happens, the Bundy's are happy with each other
(Peggy and Al still have sex, though Al doesn't want to).<br /><br />If you never saw Married...with Children then you've certainly missed
something!
