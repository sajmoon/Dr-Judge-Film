Married... With Children is a a great show. One of the best. It's great
because it's different. Most American Comedy shows split to three
categories- 1) Friends hanging around doing nothing (ie, Friends, Seinfeld,
Will &amp; Grace) 2) Family (ie, Full House, Who's the Boss?, Family Matters) 3)
Wacky Characters and Magic (ie, Third Rock From the Sun, Sabrina the Teenage
Witch). This show stands out. Family? Well, maybe but definitely not on the
lines of Full House.<br /><br />Married... With Children is about your typical American family. Al Bundy is
a shoe-salesman who makes less money than a circus clown. Peggy Bundy, his
wife is your typical housewife (besides the fact that she doesn't clean,
cook, iron and wash)- she spends her days on the couch watching Oprah and
awaits the TV guide. Bud Bundy is their loser son, he's smart and he'll do
anything to get a girl. Kelly Bundy is the opposite of Bud, she's utterly
stupid and can get any guy she wants. Al Bundy encourages his son to have
sex but likes playing kick-the-boyfriend when it comes to Kelly. Besides
that, they don't eat inside and usually are starved. When they get to travel
they always end up nearly dead (in Missouri by an axe-murderer, in London by
angry British folks who by killing the Bundys will lift curses on their
towns, on a cruise-liner when it drowns). Married... With Children is unlike
any other comedy that was ever on TV, all cheap imitations proved to fail.
Married... With Children says whatever it wants to say and is never afraid
to speak, spoofing nearly every movie, TV show, stereotype and person to
have ever roamed planet Earth.
