Al Bundy suffers one humiliation after another, thanks to a layabout
wife, trampy daughter, clueless son and fickle dog. Neighbors named
Darcy fuel the fire, with their antics. Add some well-meaning male
companions and a dead-end job and you have a show that could rightly
have been called, &quot;Father Knows Nothing.&quot; Norman Lear was credited with
breaking untested ground when &quot;All In the Family&quot; premiered. The Fox
Network, however, pushed the envelope even farther with MWC. A man
languishing as a ladies shoe salesman (and having the measure of
&quot;support&quot; he had at home) with no prospect of advancement was the
height (or depth, depending on one&#39;s perspective) of absurdity and also
precisely what made this show as appealing and hilarious as it was. <br /><br />Viewers had never seen a family like the Bundys. Baby boomers grew up
with the Nelsons, Gillises, Taylors, Andersons, Cleavers, and others.
When the Bundys came along, we were ill prepared. And yet, despite all
the dysfunction, we each recognized that we knew someone similar to a
member, neighbor or co-worker of the Bundy clan. We still loved them
and our new found friends, the Bundys, were welcomed with open arms.
