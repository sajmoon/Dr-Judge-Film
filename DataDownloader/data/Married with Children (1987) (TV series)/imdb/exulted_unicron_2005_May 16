without a doubt, I would have said Married...With Children is the
greatest sitcom ever created. Many people say its a bland comedy thats
full of fart jokes and innuendo. Its more than that....Its the personal
struggle of Al Bundy, normal man who hates everything. All the man
wants is some peace and a chance to be rich...<br /><br />As soon as he touches what he believes is his personal heaven,
something always comes along to ruin the day for Al, thus leaving him
back where he was before. Comical episodes include Al trying to remove
an unwanted pest from his garden. The visitor is a rabbit and Al is
very unorthodox on how he gets rid of this pest, deciding to use a
flamethrower and explosives.
