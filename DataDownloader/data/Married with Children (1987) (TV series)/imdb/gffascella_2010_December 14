The best show that has ever been made it wasn&#x27;t like all the other
shows that talked about love and bull like that it was real comedy that
no other show can come close to.it is the perfect show for anyone who
can get this and is the number one show that has been made.it had
really deserved a final episode but they canceled it after moving the
time slot and never gave it a proper ending which is a total disrespect
to the best show that has and will ever be made.al and peg make a
masterpiece of hatred to each other while kelly is almost like a slutty
persona and bud is known for his love of chicks hotters and tries to
get in the pance of any babe.marcy is know for her chiken stance and
her lazy husband is lazy.
