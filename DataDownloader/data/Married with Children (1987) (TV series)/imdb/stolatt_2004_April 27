This was a hugely underappreciated show, though some of their jokes were
kind of stupid.  It is tied for second-funniest with &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and
&quot;Family Guy.&quot;  First is &quot;South Park.&quot;  Al Bundy should be an American
hero,
but not alongside the American fighting boys.  He was right about a lot of
the things he said and he was a lot like most married men.  I felt bad for
him at times, too.  I don't know why the show was cancelled.  It was
actually funny with the laugh-tracks.  Not many shows can do that.  If I
had
to rate it on a scale from 1-10, I would say 9.  A funny and basically
great
show.  Al Bundy will always be a guy that was misfortunate, yet would be a
lot smarter if Peg, Kelly, and Bud wouldn't stop bugging him.  If you
forgot, 9/10.
