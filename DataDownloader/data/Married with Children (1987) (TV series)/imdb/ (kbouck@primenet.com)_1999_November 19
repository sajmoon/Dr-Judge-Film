1999_November 19 

This is truly American television at its best. I have never watched a sitcom
where the characters are so well developed. Anybody who does not like this
show is prude and boring, simple as that! Al Bundy plays the funniest
Husband/Father on TV. His life is basically a joke. He sarcastically acts
like he can't stand his wife and 2 kids(Kelly and Bud). He works as a shoe
salesman and complains about his job, drives a beat up car, and fights with
his neighbors Steve and Marcy. Steve is replaced later in the series by Ted
McGinley who plays Jefferson. The script is so brilliant and the writers who
helped create this show are to credit for the shows enormous success. The
script is full of PG-13 rated raunchy humor and nonstop laughs.<br /><br />I could probably name every episode as my fave and its really hard to break
it down into just a few. All I can say is I'm truly disappointed Married
With Children eventually got discontinued after over 10 seasons and I was
very disappointed in the very last episode. All in all..Al Bundy is GOD! and
I cant wait for a reunion episode.
