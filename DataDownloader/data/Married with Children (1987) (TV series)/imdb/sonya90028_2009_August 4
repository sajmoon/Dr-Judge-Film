The Bundys are a spectacularly anti-PC, dysfunctional wreck of a
family. That&#x27;s what makes Married With Children so hysterically funny.
Poor, beleaguered shoe salesman Al Bundy, has much to contend with in
life. There&#x27;s his terminally tacky, oversexed wife Peg. Not to mention
Al&#x27;s slutty daughter Kelly, and smart-Aleck son, Bud. And the world
around Al has changed, much to his dismay. Al is still stuck in a
Neanderthal male mentality, especially with regards to women&#x27;s rights.
He&#x27;s like a modern-day Archie Bunker, who is unable, or unwilling to
adjust to contemporary society as it is.<br /><br />Ed O&#x27;Neil played Al with a smug, male-chauvinist-pig relish. Katy Segal
as Peg, lit-up the screen with her own bawdy charisma. Together, they
had a crackling comedic chemistry between them. The supporting cast,
certainly augmented the loose-cannon hilarity of this show. But Ed
O&#x27;Neil and Katy Segal, were the center that held this show together,
during it&#x27;s long run on TV. The show would&#x27;ve been much less
entertaining, without the two of them. Married With Children can now be
enjoyed via DVD. Check it out, and see why this mad-cap sitcom was so
phenomenally popular, when it was still on network TV.
