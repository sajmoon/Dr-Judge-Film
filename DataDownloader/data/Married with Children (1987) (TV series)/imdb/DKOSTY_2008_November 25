This show is an entertaining show because it never pretended to be
anything but low brow hit in the gut humor. Early on it was there to
help the FOX network fill space. From there it developed into something
of a cult viewing.<br /><br />The characters were well drawn and a lot of the humor came from
throwing them together. Al Bundy became a cultural anti-hero. Peg, his
wife, became a totally defined modern something that was there to
aggravate Al. Bud Bundy became the most frustrated teen age son that
ever existed because even when he did score it would somehow back fire.
Christina Applegate(Kelly) is the eye candy daughter who would look
good but who could be the kind of Satan that she would cross up
everything.<br /><br />Then there was Buck, the wonder dog who at times draws major laughs out
of the most bizarre things happening around them. The neighbors headed
by Ted McGinley &amp; Amanda Bearse (Marcey &amp; Jefferson) would manage a
relationship with the ultimate dysfunctional family. This show pushed
the adult humor border almost as often as The Simpsons but with wackier
results.<br /><br />There are times that the jokes hit the target and times they miss the
target. The thing is to get great humor you have to throw things
against the wall and see what sticks. With the Bundys, you throw up on
the wall and the floor opens up &amp; swallows your children. That is what
Married With Children is really all about.
