Married... with Children, to me, was and still is one of the most
outragously funny TV shows to ever air on TV. I stumbled on to it in 1987,
and have been hooked sense... I believe it is a work of art... No show can,
I believe, ever compare to this unbelievably funny program... Sundays soon
became the funniest day of the week... And yes, Married... with Children
brought FOX out into the light, just my personally opinion, of course... I
do not believe that there will ever be another Al Bundy, that to me shows
the power of his character... I sort of grew up with the Bundy's, I saw
every show, and was shocked when I found out that it would not continue for
another season... It has just never been the same sense they have gone...
BUT, there are the reruns, which I do watch every day... I wish they would
do one last show, or maybe a last season, or maybe even a movie, I would be
so, so very excited... Married... with Children always was and always will
be my all time favorite show...!
