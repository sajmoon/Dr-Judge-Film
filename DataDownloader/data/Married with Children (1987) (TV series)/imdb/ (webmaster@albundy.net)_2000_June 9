Married... with children IS the best sitcom in the world. Although it has
been canceled after 11 years the Bundys still are alive. They are shown in
over 20 countries all over the world.
I think we will never forget Al the salesman who sells shoes to fat women,
Peg who will never get a job, Kelly the blond stupid girl, Bud
(Grandmaster
B) with his girls, Marcy, Jefferson, Steve and all the other
characters.<br /><br />I only hope that there will be a great spinoff one time...<br /><br />
