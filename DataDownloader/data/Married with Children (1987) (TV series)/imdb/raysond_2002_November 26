Well,where can I start here..........let's see..................<br /><br />For one,Archie Bunker wouldn't let him in his house.<br /><br />George Jefferson would slam the door in his face.<br /><br />Maude Findley would call him a sexist pig.<br /><br />Alice Krampton would insult the daylights out of him.<br /><br />Gilligan and the Skipper would kick him right off the island.<br /><br />Marshal Dillon and Festus would run him right outta Dodge
City.<br /><br />Cagney and Lacey would toss him in jail and throw away the
key.<br /><br />Who am I referring to here in this commentary? The one and only Al
Bundy.
The show? &quot;Married...With Children&quot;. Long before The Osbourne's came
around
here,The Bundy's were the first ever,typical &quot;all-American&quot; piece of
dysfunctional taste ever conceived for television. It was no wonder that
the
show was the first ever sitcom to shown on the FOX network,and for 11
seasons this show was something to see. The all around adventures of a
family that was so unloving it was no wonder that the ONLY neighbors who
came to see them were the next door neighborhood folks..The
D'Arcy's.
Here,you have Ed O'Neill who forever in our hearts will always remained Al
Bundy. Here you had a shoe salesman who works in a shopping mall who comes
home,insults his wife and kids and always talking about having sex but
doesn't get any(which comes later on in some of the episodes)plus brags
all
the time to his friends how he recall his days as a high school football
jock who made four touchdowns in one game while at the same time insults
and
degrades women of all genders(except his wife). His wife,played by Katey
Segal who one lazy housewife who virtually watches TV all day,eats
bon-bons
and ice cream and doesn't lift a finger to do any housework(not let alone
cook a decent meal for her children)but always nags Al to death for sex.
The
Bundy kids were no better. Son Bud Bundy always wanted the girls but
didn't
have a clue on how to score with one(in some episodes he gets some from a
geek girl who has the hots for him)but the way actor David Faustino played
that role was simply magic and sometimes hilariously funny. Then you have
daughter Kelly,played by Christina Applegate. She had the look but was she
ever without a lack of brains! The next door neighbors had problems too,
You
see during the shows first couple of seasons,actress Amanda Bearse who
played Marcy,had two husbands. The first one was to Steve Rhoades(who
didn't
like The Bundy's way of thinking but remain a true friend),and then she
dumped him and fell in love for pretty boy Jefferson D'Arcy(played by Ted
McGinley) who always with Al always were coming up with some lame brain
schemes to get away from Marcy,usually with hilarious results. The ONLY
member of the family that had common sense out of all of them was that of
the family dog--BUCK!!! Then somewhere during the show,they got rid of him
and replaced him with another dog named Lucky,and boy Lucky didn't have
the
smarts like Buck,but Lucky was one dumb dog!<br /><br />Was this show one of the funniest ever of the late 80's and throughout the
90's? You bet. So hilarious,you'll cry laughing. Hard. However,during the
show's run the series spawned a sequel to it called &quot;Unhappily Ever After'
which was really dumb(and which also had a puppet for a family pet which
was
stupid which ran for one season on FOX,and then this atrocity ran for six
seasons on the WB) and so forth. During its run the show was under fire
for
being too sexist and was in fact degrading women and that's when the
network
was about to pull the plug on &quot;Married With Children&quot;,but due to it's huge
fan base,the series survived until its final episode in 1997 ending it's
11
year run on the air.<br /><br />Catch the episodes on FX.
