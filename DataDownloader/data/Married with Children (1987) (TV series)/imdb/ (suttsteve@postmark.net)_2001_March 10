Believe me, I've seen my share of sitcoms. Some of them were funny, but
most
left me feeling like I should be floating around in a bubble, or something.
Married...With Children bursts that bubble. It's basically the exact
opposite of what you expect from a typical situation comedy. It's funny as
hell, and doesn't leave you feeling like what it must feel like to be Kelly
Bundy. It's great!
