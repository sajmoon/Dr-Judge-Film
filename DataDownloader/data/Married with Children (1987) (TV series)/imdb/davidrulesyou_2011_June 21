This show, in my opinion, has to be the best sitcom I have ever
watched. It has everything a sitcom should be: differences between
people, certain amount of silliness, things that they do, the problems
they have, etc.<br /><br />The Bundys, Al, Peg, Kelly and Bud have showed the entire world that
they are the real deal and that all other family-related sitcoms that
came after are just inferior in comparison. Al just tends to hate his
job of being a shoes salesman and tends to complain about how miserable
his life is. Peg is the housewife no man would probably want to have,
well even though she tends to do cooking, she just spends her time
watching TV and slacking off. Kelly is just a dumb blonde girl you
would just can&#x27;t help but love due to her naivet&#xE9;, even though she can
be described as a slut at times. Bud is horny, but always tends to fail
at getting a girl to have interest in him.<br /><br />This show has great jokes and enough silliness to make you laugh to the
point where you might almost die from it. The acting from these actors
is just brilliant and you can get along with their characters quite
easily. This show just has everything that you want in a sitcom. Watch
it and you will not regret it. Enough said. My rating: 10/10.
