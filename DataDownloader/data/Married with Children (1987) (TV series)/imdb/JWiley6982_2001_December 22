I love Married With Children, I think it is the best, and funniest show
ever.FOX, and the creators are geniuses.I laugh out loud every time i
watch
it.It is good to watch in syndication, because there are so many episodes
you don't see the same ones all the time.I really miss watching new
episodes
of the show, but i am really glad that i can still watch reruns.I don't
understand why it was cancelled, the ratings were good and everyone liked
the show. I wish there was a final episode, but maybe in the future there
will be a final episode or a reunion.
