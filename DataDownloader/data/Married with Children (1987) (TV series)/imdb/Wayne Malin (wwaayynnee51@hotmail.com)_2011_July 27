Sit com that lasted 10 years about the Bundys--Al (Ed O&#x27;Neill), wife
Peggy (Katey Sagal), son Bud (David Faustino) and daughter Kelly
(Christina Applegate). Al is a shoe salesman and hates his job, Peggy
just stays home and does nothing, Bud is (somehow) very smart but can&#x27;t
get a date and Kelly is gorgeous but VERY dumb and sleeps around. It
also deals with their long-suffering neighbors--Marcy (Amanda Bearse)
and Steve (David Garrison) and (later on) Jefferson (Ted McGinley).
Basically the show is nonstop insults and sarcasm between all the
characters and various situations they get into.<br /><br />The show started on Fox and was basically dumped on Sunday night at
8:30 and left alone. That gave the writers free reign and they pushed
the envelope more than once. The shows got VERY outrageous and dealt
with touchy subjects (most involving sex). One of the episodes (The
Camping Show from season 3) was so extreme they put it on at 9:00. The
first four seasons were fantastic--VERY funny and well-done. After that
the show quickly fell apart. The jokes got repetitious and the laughs
were few and far between. Still the ratings were strong and Al became
an icon for working men all over. However Fox seemed embarrassed by the
show and (by the 10th season) wanted it off. They moved it to Saturday
night, the ratings dropped and it was quickly canceled.<br /><br />This show pushed the boundaries of comedy and, without it, we wouldn&#x27;t
have had the sitcoms we have today. Very mean and cruel by fun. A 10
all the way.
