Do I even have to tell you how great this show is??? Every episode is
wonderful. Reruns come on FX a lot and you should catch them whenever
possible. This is that killer true to life show that your parents said you
shouldn't watch and then they watched it as a dirty little secret. This show
is pure fun and comedy. Christina Applegate is the show's shining star even
though Ed O'Neil also does a great job. Nice nasty comedy with great acting!
It stayed on ten years, that should tell ya something!
