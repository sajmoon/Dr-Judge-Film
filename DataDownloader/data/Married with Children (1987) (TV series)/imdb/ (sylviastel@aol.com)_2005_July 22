I love &quot;Married with Children&quot; for a lot of reasons. I remember when it
first aired on the new Fox station. &quot;Married with Children&quot; and &quot;The
Tracey Ullman Show&quot; were the first two shows to air on Sunday nights
and the first night, it was aired twice. There has not been another
show like it and it&#39;s still missed very much. When &quot;Friends&quot; became
successful, you hoped that they would create the anti-Friends version
of the show just like Married with Children Bundys was inspired by the
80&#39;s Cosby Show and the almost too real Huxtable clan. The Bundys were
every family. The teens like Peg and Al who got married with no college
education ended up struggling with two undesirable children like Bud
and Kelly. The Bundys never had the luck like any of our other
television families. Ed O&#39;Neil deserved an Emmy. He liked Al so much
that he is still fond of the role. Katey Sagal was unforgettable as
Peggy with her red bouncy air and laugh. They were the unlikeliest
pairing but it worked. Christina Applegate will always be remembered as
the definitive dumb blonde Kelly Bundy. Her character like Peggy and Al
never changed and we wouldn&#39;t want them too. Remember when they change
the characters by improving them on television, the characters lose
their original, natural appeal. Even David Faustino&#39;s Bud was still the
pervert from beginning to end of the show. The neighbors began with
Steve and Marcy Rhodes, both trained in New York City theater. Steve
played by David Garrison was the typical boring father type on the show
and his wife played by Amanda Bearse really became more than just a
modern woman. As Marcy Rhodes Darcy, she became her own character
without having too rely too much on her husband. When Garrison left the
show to return to Broadway, Marcy was alone but not for long until Ted
McGinley&#39;s Jefferson Darcy came into the picture. Finally Al met his
match, a good-looking gigolo who avoided work. Jefferson too had a
spotty history. Al and Marcy&#39;s battles were always fun to watch. In
fact, Bearse also directed several of the show&#39;s episodes when she was
not in front of the camera and has become one of television&#39;s comedic
directors since the show ended by Fox abruptly. I loved AL&#39;s male
friends like Griff, Ike, Bob Rooney, and officer Dan. The show may have
made jokes at the expense of a lot of overweight even obese actresses
but that gave them exposure and work so I don&#39;t think Married with
Children should get too much negative criticism. I don&#39;t see other
shows using plus sized women at all. This was a fun show to watch and I
still miss it.
