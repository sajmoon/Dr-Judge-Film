Tom Sharpe once wrote the following regarding one of his characters:
&quot;Like
so many great men, Lord Petrefact loathed his nearest and
dearest...&quot;<br /><br />Many of us identify with Lord Petrefact, but are at a loss to express
ourselves in this &quot;don't worry--be happy,&quot; never-say-anything-negative
world.  We have very few role models to lead us against appalling,
manipulative family members, and have often resigned ourselves to our
fate.
We've gone about our lives lacking the words to easily repel the
smiley-face
squads.<br /><br />The Bundys are a superb resource for people like us.  We can't and
shouldn't
adopt a Bundy-like demeanour to truly nice, kind people.  But the Bundys
suggest to us what we can say to obnoxious relatives and neighbours -- our
nearest and (supposedly) dearest, who want US to do THEIR bidding so THEY
can receive undue obedience, money, goods or status from OUR successes or
aspirations.<br /><br />For example, in one episode, Al thinks of buying a new car.  Peg, Kelly
and
Bud all sneer at the type of car he chooses, telling him high-handedly
what
kind each of them particularly thinks he should buy -- i.e., what they
want
HIM to buy to satisfy THEM.  Al does what most of us should do in such
circumstances:  He spreads his arms in a great paternal gesture, smiles
broadly, and says, &quot;Your wishes [slight pause for effect] mean nothing to
me.&quot;  It's extremely refreshing to hear.  And it's very, very funny.  The
fact that virtually every character appearing throughout the show's long
run
was extremely sleazy allows this sort of repartee to continue
uninterrupted.<br /><br />God bless Al Bundy.  The show has changed my life.
