I'm 16 years old, and I remember being a kid and having family gatherings
around the TV every Sunday at 8:00 to watch Married With Children. And no
matter who was sitting at the TV when it came on, one would always hear
the
same cry- &quot;BUNDY'S ON!&quot;. This went on for years, and when they finally
stopped making new episodes, it was like a whole new world. Thank God for
reruns.
Yes, I can honestly say that Married With Children changed my
life.
