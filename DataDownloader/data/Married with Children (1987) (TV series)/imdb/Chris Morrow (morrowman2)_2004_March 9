When this show first came out I thought it was interesting and unique,
but after about the 4th or 5th season the show just got kind of lame
and boring. I couldn't see how the show got to be as popular as it was.
Married with Children was just one of those TV shows that really got
ran into the ground. Granted, Ed O'Neil was funny from time to time but
the show was too lame and half the time pointless. One of those shows
that you would watch on a rainy day or if you were absolutely bored. I
don't see why everyone thought it was so funny, because it wasn't. Fox
could have done a lot better with the script. Ed O'Neil as Al Bundy was
the only character who was semi funny and even he had his dull points.
