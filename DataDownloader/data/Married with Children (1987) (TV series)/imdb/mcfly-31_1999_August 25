1999_August 25 

Probably more different than any family show, this one focused on a family
with no food, a mother and father who loathed each other, two smart ass
kids, and no love in sight at all.  All the characters were constantly
slamming each other with some sort of sexual joke or putdown.  After the
first couple years they started using Al (O'Neill) as a helpless victim of
electrocution, gunshot, or dropped off the roof sightgags.  Their
strongest
showing was the first 4 years, with truly hilarious episodes full of
raunchiness and many tasteless moments.  But after year 5 started the
writing started to head downhill and some of the creative team was
changed.
It didnt help much as the final five years had hit and miss moments. The
silliness just had reached such an unbelievable peak, that the show wasnt
grounded in any reality.  Not that when the series began it was depicting
a
true family, but at least it wasnt too overboard in its humor.  My
favorite
episode over they years is the one thats available on video entitled &quot;Its
a
Bunderful Life,&quot; where Al finds out what the family would be like without
him.  Sam Kinison is great as his angel who shows him how the kids and
Peggy
would be, in some very funny character alterations.  Id never call this
show
one of my top five faves, but it did make the depressing lives of the
characters good for a lot of laughs.  O'Neill was perfect as the lousy
luck
father, Sagal as the couch glued housewife, Faustino as the hopeless
hornball son, and Applegate as the sexy bimbo daughter.  Occasionally
appearing (and directing) was Bearse as up tight neighbor Marcy, with her
husbands being conservative Steve, who ultimately ran off on her to be a
park ranger, and then McGinley as Jefferson, the overly confident,
unemployed househusband.  Some very memorable characters who enjoyed a
surprising 10 year run.
