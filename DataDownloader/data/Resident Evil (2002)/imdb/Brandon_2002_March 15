I got to see this movie for free since my best friend works at a local
theater. Its a good thing too because I wouldn't have paid over $1.00 to
see
this crap. I'm a fan of the Resident Evil video games and I understand
that
the conversion from game to movie is hard. But thats not what made this
movie ridiculous, in fact it lines up pretty well with the beginning of
the
first Resident Evil game, and the movie itself has a good plot. What makes
this movie ridiculous is Umbrella's swat team sent in to control the
threat
of the T- Virus. This is the most absurd conglomeration of soldiers I have
ever seen. Most of the people in the squad crap themselves whenever they
witness anything bizarre. And Michelle Rodriguez's character &quot;Rain&quot; is
absurd. Its like Paul Anderson was writing this movie and said, &quot;hmm I
think
I'll make one of the characters a ghetto bitch with a bad attitude.&quot; If
this
movie is anyones fault it is Paul Anderson's. From the opening scene where
Rain tells another character to &quot;blow me&quot; Resident Evil is full of
ridiculous one liners. In fact thats about all of the dialogue. The only
real speaking role is that of the &quot;red queen,&quot; the A.I computer system
that
is in control of the lab in which the outbreak has occured. As far as gore
and violence go I have no idea why this movie was rated R other than the
use
of the F word. Anyone who applauds the action (if you can call them that)
scenes in this movie is a moron. This movie is a joke and a disgrace to
any
other zombie based movie. I give it a 6 out of 10 only because Milla
Jevovich is naked.
