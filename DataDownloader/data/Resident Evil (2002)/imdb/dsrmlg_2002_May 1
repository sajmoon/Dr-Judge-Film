Don't take my word for it (well do, but make your own opinion by seeing it
yourself), but Resident Evil is a fantastic movie! If you like a good
action, suspense movie this is for you!<br /><br />The technical aspects of the movie are spectacular! Cameras, audio and
visual effects all added to the overall helping to create the best movie
I've seen in a long long while.<br /><br />The selection of acting skill was done quite well, imho. Just take a look
at
many of the other films some of these people have done - especially Milla;
she's been in some very good movies in the recent past, and her abilities
didn't shy away from the challenge in this great piece of
art!<br /><br />Some of you might think &quot;Game to movie conversion?!! I don't think so!&quot;
But
hold off on that thought process. This movie portrays a general mix of the
game &quot;stuff&quot; quite effectively. I had my doubts, but they were quickly set
aside and discarded upon watching the first few minutes.<br /><br />The &quot;comic bookyness&quot; of the movie was a pleasing minimum. I don't like
when
movies go overboard in trying to do their special effects, but this movie
had the perfect mix of computer graphics and such and reality.<br /><br />I stress that if you've heard any bad commentary on this masterpiece
(although I can't imagine why anyone would think anything bad about this
movie ;) ), please disregard it until you've seen it yourself - you'll be
incredibly pleased you did - It's brilliant!
