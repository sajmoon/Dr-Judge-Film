This is a fast paced, high-tech, high-action, horror film that keeps you
entertained from beginning to end.  There have been other attempts at
bringing video games to the big screen that had miserable results.  Of
course, we all remember the ill-fated Mario Brothers movie.  MORTAL KOMBAT
was probably the biggest let down.  TOMB RAIDER was not as bad, but still
failed to really &quot;wow&quot; audiences.  So far, I would say RESIDENT EVIL is the
best video-game-gone-big-screen so far.  <br /><br />The plot outline is pretty simple:  A team of commandos venture in to a
secret corporate research base to discover what went wrong and why all the
employees were killed off.  They find out that horrible experiments were
taking place and a biological terror is released in the form of vicious,
flesh-eating zombies.  They have to find the antidote and get out before
they are sealed inside forever.  <br /><br />The film moves fast.  There are a lot of scares, some of which are set up
with fast editing, but the film pulls it off effectively.  The gore abounds
and is VERY well done.  Some of the disfigurements of the zombies was done
with CGI to great effect.  There is one zombie that is missing a large
portion of his head, which pretty much looks like swiss cheese, and that
effect is both startling and grotesque.  I loved!  And if Zombies are not
enough for you, there are also zombie dobermans.  And if that doesn't give
you nightmares, there is a big, Frankenstien/Alien-from-hell monster that
breaks loose from its incubation chamber that probably will give you
nightmares. <br /><br />Besides the great effects, there are a lot of cool scenes throughout the
movie.  The highlight of which is probably the part where the commandos are
sliced up with a laser beam.  Also, the gore effects here are fantastic. 
(The end of the guy's knife getting sliced off and falling on the floor was
a nice touch!)  In fact, this movie is a lot gorier than I anticipated it
would be.  It is much more gore-infested than most movies that have been
coming out in recent years.  So that is a breath of fresh air to a horror
fan like me.  <br /><br />In some ways, the movie amounts to a very well done &quot;B&quot; horror flick.  If
you are like me, you will love that kind of stuff.  Although this is not a
perfect movie, the second act is long and well developed.  By this I refer
to the characters getting further and further in to trouble.  The situation
gets worse, and then, just when you think the situation could not get any
worse, it gets WORSE still!  Which creates some good suspense and great
action scenes which build up to a fantastic third act with an exciting final
battle on the train.  Without giving anything away, I will just say that the
conclusion was really well done.  I really liked the ending, not only
because it was creepy and the final special effect was really grandiose, but
because we get to see Milla Jovovich's muffin...who could ask for anything
better?  She certainly doesn't seem to have a problem getting naked, which
is a good thing.  Made me reminisce of the good old horror movies of the
early 80's.  <br /><br />Only two minor complaints.  The part where Milla starts breaking everybody's
neck, I didn't really buy that.  The human neck doesn't break so easily. 
Although, dying with Milla's thighs wrapped around my neck sounds like a
pretty nice way to go.  And sometimes the characters get in to deep trouble
and then the movie doesn't really explain how they got out of that trouble. 
This doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the film, however. <br /><br />If you liked ALIENS and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (my all time favorite
horror/zombie movie) then you will like RESIDENT EVIL.  Don't make the
mistake of thinking this is another bummer of a video game/movie.  It is an
effective horror movie all on it's own.
