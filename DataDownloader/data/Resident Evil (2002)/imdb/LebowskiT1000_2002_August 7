2002_August 7 

First of all, let me start by saying that I am not a huge fan of the video
games (or zombie films for that matter).  I own the three games for the
playstation, but I could never really get into them.<br /><br />As for the movie, I thought it was fairly entertaining.  It had it's good
points and low points, like most movies.  The story is nothing terribly
intellectual, but it's interesting.  There are a lot of things you just have
to accept and take for granted in the film.  Such as why on earth they would
have created this virus in the first place, and what on earth that crazy dog
beast thing was!  But, ok, I'll accept it.<br /><br />The only major complaint I have about the film is the music in the film.  I
love type of music that they used in the film, in fact I own a lot of the
music that was used in the film, but it seemed to me that most of the time
the music was just overwhelming and out of place.<br /><br />The special effects in this film were surprisingly good.  I wasn't really
impressed with the trailers for this film, but seeing them in context made
it much better.<br /><br />The acting is nothing to get excited about.  It's good, but it's a zombie
movie, so you can't really expect great performances.  Milla Jovovich looked
really good in this film, and there are even a few times where Michelle
Rodriguez cracked a smile and looked pretty.  She always seems to have scowl
on her face, and her eyes are always up in her eyebrows.  The only other
cast member I'd heard of was Eric Mabius, he did just fine with his role. 
Although, I did recognize Colin Salmon from the 2 (soon to be 3) most recent
James Bond films.  He did a fine job as well.<br /><br />I would think that anyone that likes zombie movies and those type of films
would like this one.  Also, if you're into gory films, you may want to check
this out.  I hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading,<br /><br />-Chris
