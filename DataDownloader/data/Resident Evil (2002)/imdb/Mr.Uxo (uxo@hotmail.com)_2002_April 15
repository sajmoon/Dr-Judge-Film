Somebody mailed a BM (Bowel Movement) into Hollywood and they made a film
about it. This movie based on the popular video game was a horror to watch
leading me on a number of occasions to look for a gun or any kind of weapon
so I could put an end to my misery. Fortunately for me, there was nothing
but stale soda and greasy popcorn. Just when I thought this movie was going
to end, it started back up again, did this about 3 different times. The best
part of the movie was when the credits were rolling. That and the sexy Mila
Jovovich who we do get to see naked  yes guys thats right, naked! Anyhow the
one redeeming feature about Resident Evil was how it set itself up for for
Resident Evil 2 based yes, also on the video game. <br /><br />My pick, 3/10 stars, avoid this film like you would a room full of Undead
Zombies <br /><br />
