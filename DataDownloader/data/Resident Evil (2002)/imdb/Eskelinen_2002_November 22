When I went to see this movie, I really supposed that I am going to see
something really really bad. It is very well known to all, that these game
movies just aren`t any good.<br /><br />But to my big surprise, this movie weren`t that bad. It was actually quite
okey. Although it isn`t really a masterpiece it is highly enterteining.
The
storyline(?) moves solidly forward and there aren`t any boring moments.
And
there is always this &quot;oh sh** we are gonna die&quot; feeling when watching this
movie.
There are two hot babes and lots of zombies, what could be more
fun?
I also LOVED the ending, it`s just great.
