2002_April 8 

I had very high expectations on this film, but I found out that it really
sucked. Paul Anderson did a rather god job with Event horizon
(violent and scary)...which R. E did not have...I mean juicy gore and
a creepy mood. Now do not get me wrong..this film has quite a lot
of action...but there are no gory action and this is supposed to
have zombies in it. Just when your&acute;re about to see some cool
special effects, they cut those parts off. Lack of money or what? I
wish they had not kicked George a. Romero out. Secondly there
are a lot of holes in the story. Thru the whole film I sat and
wondered what was really happening. Is this just a film for those
who played the game? And for the last why is this rated R...it
should be rated PG -13 or something. So if you like films such as
John Carpenter&acute;s Ghosts of Mars...you will enjoy this one.  I rate
this 3 out of 10.
