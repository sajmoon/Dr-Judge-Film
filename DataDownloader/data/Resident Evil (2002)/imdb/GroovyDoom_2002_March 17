For a film that cannibalizes so many others, it's fitting that this one
would feature cannibalistic corpses.  As much as I love zombie movies, it's
hard to hate &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, even though my brain tells me it was pretty
bad.<br /><br />The plot is hard to ruin by exposing too much of it (although Roger Ebert
did a pretty good job in his review in the Chicago Sun Times).  It's pretty
basic:  accident at secret underground lab, special forces team goes down to
investigate.  Yes, apparently the facility's high-tech monitoring system
does not feature a link to the outside world, which would demonstrate in no
uncertain terms that the facility is now overrun with reanimated corpses due
to a viral leak.  But no matter...if it happened that way there would be no
movie, right?  (Note in case this ever happens in real life:  the virus that
turns everyone into a zombie apparently affects everything just through
touch or inhalation.  The antidote, however, must be injected...and even
then it may not work.) <br /><br />For some reason (also explained in vague terms), our heroes must venture to
the core of the facility and disarm the Ubercomputer, the &quot;Red Queen&quot;.  The
&quot;Red Queen&quot; talks to them (plot exposition has to go somewhere).  She even
appears as a hologram while she is explaining things.  What she fails to
explain is how the SWAT team got into the compound in the first place, if
she sealed it off.<br /><br />The zombie action in the film is somewhat subdued.  Fans of blood &amp; guts
will be disappointed.  Although the implication of violence can be a good
thing, here it just looks as if it were snipped from the final print of the
film, and apparently it was.  After all, a film about the living dead should
go for the gross-out.  Not once do we actually get a glimpse of a zombie
biting into one of the characters.<br /><br />Fans of Milla Jovovich, however, will be delighted.  Her costume for the
film is a revealing dress with a man's jacket thrown over it.  That is, when
she's not naked.  The other actors are pretty good too, although their roles
don't call for much.<br /><br />And, as usual, the biggest liability in the movie are the computer-generated
effects, such as a creature known as &quot;The Licker&quot;.  We get what it's
supposed to look like, but it looks more like a cartoon.  Additionally, the
director obscures a lot of the action with quick cuts and choppy editing,
most notably in a scene where people get sliced with a killer laser, after
which we don't even get to see the bodies.  Boooo, hisssss.<br /><br />I guess what I did like about &quot;Resident Evil&quot; is the dreamlike way the story
unfolds.  It may not be much, but at least it's atmospheric.  Milla
Jovovich's character (I can't remember one instance in the film where anyone
used her name, but according to the IMDB she had three) is suffering from
memory loss, and the unfolding of her memories adds a &quot;Memento&quot;-like quality
to the film.  The director manages to create a very tense environment,
although at the expense of much credibility.  Much of the film's look and
plot are derived from &quot;Aliens&quot; and &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;, right down to certain
lines of dialogue.  I suppose these are supposed to be sly references, or
else ripoffs.  You be the judge.<br /><br />Verdict:  &quot;Resident Evil&quot; is passable fun while you're watching it,
ultimately forgettable after the credits roll.  Unlike &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;,
which lives on in the memories of people as being a lot better than it
actually is, &quot;Resident Evil&quot; probably won't live forever in anybody's memory
except for those who are really, really into the video
game.<br /><br />Oh, and the memories of everyone who wants to see Milla Jovovich
naked.
