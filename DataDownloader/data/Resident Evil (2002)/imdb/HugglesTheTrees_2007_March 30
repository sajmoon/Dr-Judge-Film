I borrowed this movie from my cousin who said she didn&#39;t much care for
it and since me and her agree on almost everything, the fact that I
found this movie to be pretty decent surprised me all together. The one
thing that bothers me though is the slow beginning and the action
scenes are jumpy and a little too chaotic as well as not really the
best when dealing with the actual coordination part.<br /><br />Now for the good... the acting was up to par and the soundtrack was
pretty awesome...but then again I love rock and metal music. It is a
must see if you love zombie movies.<br /><br />8/10
