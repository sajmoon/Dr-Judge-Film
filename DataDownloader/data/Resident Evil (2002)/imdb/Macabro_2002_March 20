Personally, Resident Evil caused me somewhat of a disappointment.  Being
that I am a fan of horror and consider myself to be a connoisseur in the
genre, I went to the movie theatre with the idea that I was going to see
real zombies; such as those in George Romero's trilogy or Lucio Fulci's
Zombi 2, even like those in the classic B movie Children Shouldn't Play with
Dead Things.  But it was nothing like that.  <br /><br />On the contrary, the zombies in Resident Evil looked stupid and not scary at
all.  What happened to the classic zombie moans and humming?  The facial
close-ups?  The gore? The explicit zombie attacks? The loud bites and zombie
appetite?  And the list can go on just to compare what a classic zombie
movie should be versus the new zombies such as the ones portrayed in
Resident Evil where even some of the zombies faces were computer generated.<br /><br />It seems like good horror films will not make a come back to the big screen.
 There have been many, such as Scream, Urban Legend, I Know what you did
Last Summer, Disturbing Behavior, Jeepers Creepers and so many more recent
films, but none are true to the genre.  There will probably never be another
Suspiria, Evil Dead, Inferno, Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Phenomena among
others.<br /><br />Now taking Resident Evil from a different point of view: it is an OK
Hollywood movie, entertaining and very similar to the video game     
(T-virus, killer Dobermans, Train, Licker, Umbrella).  Milla Jovovich beauty
enlightens the screen and her performance is pretty good.  Overall the film
is watchable, not the greatest but still entertaining.
