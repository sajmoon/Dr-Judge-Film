Director Paul Anderson has done two of my favorite films--&quot;Mortal
Kombat&quot; (I know it's based on a video game but I liked it) and &quot;Event
Horizon&quot; (one of the most unsettling sci-fi/horror films ever). This
movie (also based on a video game) isn't good as the other two. But for
what it is, it's great.<br /><br />A virus is mistakenly (?) let loose in a huge underground city run by a
corporation. It kills everyone there and a military squad is sent down
to deactivate the central computer. But the computer is active,
aware...and angry. Soon the squad is dealing with flesh-eating zombies,
zombie dogs and a huge, scary, angry mutant.<br /><br />The plot is needlessly complex and convoluted and brings the movie to a
screeching halt so characters can explain what's going on. Also this
movie goes out of its way to show Milla Jovovich nude more than once.
But still, I enjoyed this movie. The acting is OK except for Jovovich
and Michelle Rodriguez--they're both very attractive but are terrible
actors--there blank faces and lousy dialogue readings got annoying. The
male members of the cast were, on the other hand, very good. The
special effects are stunning and the movie is very loud, very fast,
very violent and FUN! The booming music score helps propel the movie
along. Also it has more than its share of creepy moments (the voice of
the computer spooked me for some reason--it's a little girls voice!).
Blood, violence, noise--hey, what more could you ask for? Worth
catching.
