Y'know, I've often said that movies are like music. There's no deciding
whether something is bad or good, it's in the eye of the beholder. This
mass
of people saying that this movie is the best zombie movie ever though, I
mean c'mon people! First off, the Evil Dead Trilogy is scarier than this
film, and I just saw those 3 movies for the first time last week. Those
films were't even supposed to be scary, and had really small budgets, but
were 10 times more fun.<br /><br />In response to everyone saying you get to see Milla Jovovich
naked...(Sarcasm begins now)
OH WOW! I got to see half of Milla's nipple! OH MY GOD! The promised land
does exist! Oh please God, just let me see a full nipple one day, and I
promise I'll never sin again!
(End Sarcasm)
Anyway, if I want to see Milla naked, I'm sure she's posed for Playboy or
something, and you saw more in the Fifth Element anyway. Plus she was
younger and looked a lot better in that film.<br /><br />I hate Michelle Rodriguez. She's not hot in my opinion and she's played
pretty much the same role in every movie she's been in. At least most
actors
who get typecast try to break away. Granted, they usually suck at whatever
they try different, but that's not the point. Jim Carrey is a perfect
example.<br /><br />By the way, was Milla's character ever mentioned by name in the movie? Or
do
we all know she was named Alice from this site and the credits. My friends
and I could all swear we never heard her name or the black guy who looks
like Laurence Fishburne's name. What a sucky script, we can't even get
names
for the people....<br /><br />Anyways, I think this film sucked, if you think it was cool, then go rent a
real zombie movie, or at least find something that's not a Matrix wannabe (
Jump kicking Dog scene, bullet time licker scene)...
