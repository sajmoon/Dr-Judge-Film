This goes to show what schlock Paul Anderson creates when you give him a
couple of millions dollars and free reign to write up a script that insults
even the perosn with subzero IQs. Resident Evil should as well be called
Scream if you saw Resident Hack Last Summer. I mean for crying out loud
every single dumb horror movie cliche is done here. It's like watching
Scary Movie all over again. LOL.<br /><br />Really the only people who keep claiming this movie is the best video game
to
movie translation are the same people who also claim Final Fantasy as the
best video game to movie translation. Yeah okay, there goes your
credibility
there.<br /><br />Gag meter: -23422 out of 10.
