...What do I have to say about a movie like this?  It comes off as
a
video game and offers little for the grown-up community.  On the other
hand,
if you enjoy brainless (no pun intended) action with little plot, then
this
movie is an enjoyable waste of 101 minutes...  Would I see it again?
Probably not.  Would I like to own it?  Absolutely not.  Did I like it?
As
an adult, no.  As a 14 year old male, kinda.  You decide if it's a good
way
to kill brain cells.<br /><br />Final Rating: 4.5
