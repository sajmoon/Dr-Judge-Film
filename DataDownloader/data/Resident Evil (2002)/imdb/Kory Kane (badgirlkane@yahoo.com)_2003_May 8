Paul W.S Anderson the man behind the Mortal Combat movies made this video
game into a very decent horror/zombie film.I heard originally they had
asked
George A Romero ( The Godfather of Zombie films) to script this and direct
this version and honestly as a horror film fan of both mainstream and
independent horror films I feel this movie would've been less action film
and more horrific if Mr Romero had written the screenplay and directed
this
film and it would've been more to my liking. However,MR Anderson did do a
very good job at keeping this film suspenseful (though at times the
filiming
background is so dark you can barely see what is going on ) and the gore
could have been a little more excessive especially considering this is a
Zombie movie but for a mainstream film it was decently gory. Milla
Jojovovich was very good as the films heroine and looked kick ass in her
evening gown battle-dress and Michelle Rodriguez is hilarious as the
overly
tough girl character. It stayed as true to the videos game plot as it
could
and that actually worked well for the film. I have to say i'm actually
looking forward to the sequel and am just glad that the Zombie genere has
been brought back as after watching countless bad awful Italian zombie
films
I'm glad that my favorite horror genere is back in some form at least,as
it
doesn't look like Mr Romero has any plans to do a 4th Living Dead film and
the only other talk that Hollywood has is its to  remake the classics that
Mr Romero has already done and in my opinion shouldn't be reamde.There are
classic horror films.LEAVE THEM ALONE!!!!!!!! but I beleive the sequel to
Resident Evil will be sonething to look forward to in the summer of 2004
as
will be the much anticipated sequel to Ginger Snaps as well. My only
request
is please make Resident Evil 2 more gorier and show more of the Nemesis
monster as the computer-animated creature in Resident Evil was awesome
looking ( and I usually hate computer-aniimated monster as they usually
look
so FAKE!!) .If you love Zombie films and ahve never seen one start off
renting the Living Dead sereis then move on to Lucio Fulci 's classic 1980
fiolm Zombie then check out the underrated 1971 classic Children Shouldn't
Play With Dead Things , then check out the Resident Evil film. **** out of
*****
