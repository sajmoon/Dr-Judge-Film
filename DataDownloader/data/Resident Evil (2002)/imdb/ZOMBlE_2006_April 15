I understand George A Romero was at one point going to direct this
movie. It might have turned out better, but then Land of the Dead was
not what it could have been either. Milla Jovovich is a knockout, and
some of the zombie attacks are kind of scary, but this movie tries to
make up in stylized action what it lacks in plot. Nowhere near as lame
as House of the Dead, but perhaps video games should remain games, not
movies. Still, Resident Evil had a few great death scenes. I personally
liked the zig-zagging laser which sliced people into bits, but I
could&#39;ve done without the CGI dogs. they looked like dobermans dipped
in strawberry jam. Too bad Michelle Rodriguez wasn&#39;t around for Part 2.
