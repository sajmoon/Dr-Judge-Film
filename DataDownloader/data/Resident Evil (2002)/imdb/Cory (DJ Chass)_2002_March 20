I've been expecting this movie since I first heard of the plans to make
the
games a motion picture, and as (I'm sure) we all know, that can lead to
high
expectations.  This movie did not disappoint me at all.  While it is true
that the fans who have played all the games (myself included) will have a
little bit more fun recognizing the situations and characters (so THAT'S
where Nemesis came from!), the movie is a wonderful opener to the entire
story line, and hopefully will introduce many people to the games, as they
are all truly exceptional chunks of programming.  There was also a lot of
symbolism in the movie that I found genuinely interesting.  If you're
familiar with Alice In Wonderland, you might know what I'm referring to:<br /><br />-Main character's name is Alice...<br /><br />-Evil Computer is called the 'Red Queen'...<br /><br />-The scene with somebody having to be sacrificed so the Red Queen will
give
them the code to escape, and the method is a proposed beheading (OFF WITH
HER HEAD!)... and I'm sure there's more...<br /><br />Overall a totally enjoyable movie, with quite a few good scares to boot.
Go
see it, and you should not be disappointed.
