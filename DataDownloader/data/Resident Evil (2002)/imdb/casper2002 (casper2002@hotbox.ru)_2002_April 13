Paul Anderson made the best video-game-shoot-them-all-movie.
Simple story &amp; screenplay, bad main hero, but movie is very
intresting.
Good scary atmosphere &amp; you just waiting another zombie in every
scene.
Resident Evil one of the best scary movie ever. Beter than Event Horizont
&amp;
Hellraiser. &quot;It's a video game&quot;- Mila Yovovich.
