Being a zombie film fan, resident evil sent me wondering whether or not it
would be possible to combine the unique atmosphere of the 1968 classic
&quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; with the intense action and suspence from the
video game. And let me put it this way; finally someone took over where
Romero left off!<br /><br />The movie has been put together in a way, so that it never, at any time,
seems to drag. All scenes, from the very first, to the, somewhat expectable
ending, slithers on in a creepy pace, that really revives the feeling I had
the first time I saw NotLD.<br /><br />As for acting, Milla Jovovich does her part well, but not the biggest
challenge she's ever had.<br /><br />All in all, this is a new generation of zombie films, and I can't wait till
&quot;Resident Evil 2 : Nemesis&quot; comes out!
