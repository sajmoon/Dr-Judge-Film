My son is really, really, really into this video game, and as you might
expect, he enjoyed it a lot more than I did.  However, I'm not going to
rag
on this Video Game-to-Movie.  To tell the truth, I found myself enjoying
it
for what it is:  A good, scary zombie flick with the kind of special
effects
we take for granted anymore and lots of action.
