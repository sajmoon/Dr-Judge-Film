I'm going to get to the point on this one.  This was a good movie.  But if
you're a fan of the video game and you're one of those nic-pick and this and
that, than just stay away from this one.  The truth is that NO MOVIE WILL
EVER BE LIKE THE VIDEO GAME!!!  Resident Evil movie is the video game like
X-Men movie is to comic.  If you're a fan than take this movie for what it
is:  a movie.  Save that &quot;that can't happen&quot; or &quot;that's not the way it is in
the video game&quot; for your friends who care.
