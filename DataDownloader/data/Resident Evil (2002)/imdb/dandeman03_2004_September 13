OK I am a massive fan of Resident Evil the movie but I think I spotted
a possible flaw or two in the film. In the scene where everyone is
getting killed in the tunnel when the last man (the coloured guy) is
about to get killed the laser becomes a giant cris-crossed wall that
hits the man. In a scene seconds later it shows the rest of the peoples
bodies lay there. My question is when the laser becomes the wall
wouldn't there bodies get cut up as well. Also what happens to the
bodies when Alice returns later. That never gets explained. Please
confirm or tell me if I am wrong cheers!<br /><br />Dandeman03
