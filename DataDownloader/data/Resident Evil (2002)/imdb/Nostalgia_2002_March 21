I have some mixed reviews about this movie.  I will detail the good points
first and then point out a few flaws or holes in the plot that can make or
break your opinion.<br /><br />Good Points:<br /><br />Music, action, zombies, blood, shooting, guns, some flesh flashing are all
good points.<br /><br />Action, shooting, guns and blood can all be categorized together.  One
compliments the other and it was all well put together.<br /><br />Zombies were fantastic, with their heart stopping surprise thriller
moments,
great makeup and pretty good but not spectacular computer animated
effects.
They made me think of the old great Night of the Living dead movies, but
the
actors that portrayed them were better.<br /><br />Music was fantastic, the score was great for this movie and I was well
pumped up for all the action scenes.<br /><br />Flesh Flashing.. well being a guy.. let's just leave it at that..<br /><br />Bad Points:<br /><br />Not many, while the music and score were great, it was a little too loud
at
a few points.  The acting wasn't spectacular but adequate for a zombie
flick.. just think back to Night of the Living Dead and remember how bad
the
acting was for those movies.<br /><br />Lastly, the major plot hole I noticed.  The movie shows that one of the
blue
vials were broken in the lab, the lab then sealed and locked.  Allright
that's fine, but what I find disturbing, and this is after having worked
in
a level 5 capable lab environment, is that the virus could become airborne
through the ventilation system.  Technically.. impossible.  There are so
many filters and security measures in virus labs that it would be
completely
impossible for that virus to go airborne.  Even if the hive computer
wanted
it to.  You just can't turn off a filter.<br /><br />If you think about that, then there is no movie, they should have thought
of
another way to spread the virus, say.. through a plague of rats they were
testing on or use the method that was used in 12 Monkeys.<br /><br />Overall: Great movie and a must see for video game fans or
not.
