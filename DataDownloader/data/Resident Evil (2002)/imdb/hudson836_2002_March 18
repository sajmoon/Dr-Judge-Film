At first I was skeptical about seeing it because it hardly follows the
video
game.  I was pleasantly surprised that it was so good.  It's one of those
movies that I could see again and again.  Not to put down the movie or
anything, but there were only two problems I had with it.  First, it
relied
entirely on the music to make it scary.  And second, that action never let
up.  There was never a stop in the action for the audience to take
breather.
Other than that, I thought it was great and I can't wait until it comes
out
on video (hopefully that won't take too long).
