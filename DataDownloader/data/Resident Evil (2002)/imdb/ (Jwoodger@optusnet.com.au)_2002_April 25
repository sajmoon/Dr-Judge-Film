This movie has to be the best game-to-movie translation ive seen so far
(which cant be saying much).  This movie steers closely to the plot that is
shown near the end of the second game and most of the third game (that lab
environment).  You wont be seeing any of that haunted house environment,
just in case you 'day of the dead' enthusiasts are looking for a new romp.
All in all, its a very fun, shallow movie and the ending definately leaves
itself open for a sequel.
