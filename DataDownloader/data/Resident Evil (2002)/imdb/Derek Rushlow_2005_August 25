Exactly what can I say about &quot;Resident Evil?&quot; Well, first of all it's
based on a popular video game series, so expect a lot of the action to
be the same kind of action you would find in a cartoon. Second, be
prepared for an incoherent plot (which is kind of dumb). Finally, get
ready for lots of gore.<br /><br />So, why five out of ten stars? It's a lot of fun to watch. Even though
it's totally unbelievable, it's somewhat involving (despite, like noted
above, the dumb, incoherent plot). The characters are fun to watch,
especially Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez, who have to be the
toughest heroines in movie history.<br /><br />The special effects are very good, as is the enthusiastic direction by
Paul W.S. Anderson (who also wrote the script based on his favorite
video game). Also, the movie has a fun opening sequence.<br /><br />In brief, the movie is about a super computer in a top secret,
underground research facility called 'The Hive' which goes awry,
killing everyone down there. However, a manufactured virus brings them
(and a few dogs) back from the dead, resulting in flesh-eating zombies.<br /><br />A lot of people might frown when they learn the plot and, eventually,
see the movie, thinking it's something too unbelievable. Then again,
what do they expect from a movie based on a video game?
