A big hit and a couple misses means you'll love or hate it...<br /><br />THE GOOD
----------------<br /><br />The movie has a great opening (minus the video game-like title
intro).  The first 15 min. of the movie does a great job of getting you
very uncomfortable.  Then the movie becomes pretty much
nonstop action till the finish.
The director likes to put in scenes that are nerve wracking, but
predictable... BUT then turns around and manages to surprise
you   There were times when I was thinking to myself, &quot;Oh man,
he's gonna get it... Wait, he's gonna pull through... See, I knew it,
lame... This movie sucks... WAIT(jump)!  He didn't make it!
Awesome.&quot;<br /><br />Alice(Milla Jovovich), the main character, was surprisingly likable.
She did as good a job as she could have for the character, and I
actually cared about what happened to her. I dont care too much
for the actress's previous work so I was expecting another
annoying performance, but, to my surprise, she was great.  She
had great reactions, the character was strong without being &quot;IN
YOUR FACE&quot; and she actually managed to warm my heart a bit.
:)<br /><br />Resident Evil is a classic pure zombie movie (love it or hate it), and
most people have seen the old cliche's before.  What I think sets
Resident Evil apart is that it takes what you think will happen and
switch it around to surprise you... That and the zombies aren't
slow! ;)<br /><br />The sound was really loud... Sometimes annoyingly loud...
However, the soundtrack was very effective in enhancing the mood
and I actually got a kick out it.<br /><br />THE BAD
-------------<br /><br />WARNING!  This movie is not deep or intelligent in anyway.  It's
there simply to get a couple thrills and have some fun.  Its a video
game movie and it shows.<br /><br />There were a couple things that dragged this movie down.
Rain(Michelle Rodriguez ), a female soldier working for Umbrella,
was completely awful.  Her lines (&quot;After this is over, I'm gonna get
laid&quot;) and her character's unrealistic reactions make her the most
annoying female supporting role ever.  She was what was wrong
with Resident Evil.<br /><br />There were a couple parts of the movie where the plot felt a tad
clumbsy, it didnt injure the incredibly basic plot too bad.  Mostly
they were creative mistakes.  Some of the lines were just terrible.
&quot;Kiss me bitch&quot;<br /><br />Also the CG was pretty bad and way too &quot;clean&quot; and &quot;look at how
cool I am&quot;.<br /><br />In the end, I had a lot of good dumb fun and I was actually looking
forward for the sequel despite glaring flaws!  Definately better than
expected.   RATING :  8/10
