People keep giving this film good reviews. It was just bad. Bad bad bad.
Why
do studios keep giving Paul Anderson money? If someone makes a debut as bad
as 'Shopping', then continues to consistently make awful films (okay,
'Event
Horizon' was good ish, but the ending was a farce) why does Hollywood keep
giving them money? 'Mortal Kombat' anyone? At least 'Soldier' was so
horrifically bad that you could laugh at it, and at the $20 million that
Kurt walked off with. But 'Resident Evil'? It's not difficult making a
Zombie film. Zombies stumble around, Zombies chew people, Zombies get shot.
What's the problem? All I ask for is some mindless violence, Milla with a
big gun shooting Zombies. Did I get it? No! After she started kicking the
dogs, you think, 'oo here we go, action.' But no! Paul W. S. Anderson as
he's now known, fails to deliver - yet again! A solid 1 out of 10 for me,
I'm afraid Paul. And no matter how many initials you put in your name,
you're not gonna get confused with P.T. Anderson.<br /><br />I say to all you people out there to broaden your horizons, get out of the
multiplex and down to your local video rental shop. 'Evil Dead', 'Dawn of
the Dead', 'Braindead', 'Bad Taste' - these are real zombie films.
'Starship
Troopers', 'Aliens', 'Buckaroo Banzai' - these are real sci-fi films. And
if
you want mindless action, watch an eighties Arnie film.<br /><br />Resident Evil has stolen 2 hours of my life, and I want them
back!
