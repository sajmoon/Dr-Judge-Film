After the whole George Romero fiasco I was torn...The early buzz on the film
made it look as if the film wasn't very faithful to the game which was odd
considering that Romero was let go because reportedly his script was not
faithfull to the game...Why was this odd? Well Romero's script had
characters from the first game including the monsters and if produced it
would have been a filmed version of the first game with only a few liberties
taken...The Paul Anderson script contained no characters from any of the
games except for the monsters...hmm I finally broke down and went to see the
film...<br /><br />This one easily ranks up there with the best video game to film
translations...Tomb Raider, Mortal Kombat...and now Resident
Evil...
This film contains everything from the games except for the main
characters...Zombies, ghoulish mutating Licker, crows and zombie dogs yes
most of the monsters have made into the film...The creepy camera angles from
the game are also in the film...Playing like a prequel to the game series
Anderson gives fans of the games and Romero's Living dead films a real
treat...<br /><br />SCARES:Quite a few...I pride myself on nothing ever getting to me in a
horror film...This one did...I found that I was getting real
jumpy...-10<br /><br />VIOLENCE/GORE:Lots of gunplay, Martial arts, Bloody zombies(No actual
feeding scenes-As Romero often shows in very graphic detail)...Laser grid
violence...-10<br /><br />SEX/NUDITY-Milla has a couple of very revealling scenes(WHY DO PARENTS TAKE
THEIR YOUNG ONES, REALLY YOUNG ONES TO SEE AN R-RATED ZOMBIE FLICK,I mean
even the games are an R-rated concept)-10 for the very beautiful
Milla...<br /><br />LANGUAGE-Some Profanity...-7<br /><br />OVERALL-This so far is the best film I've seen this year...Non-stop
action...great acting, scary atmosphere, great monsters...Creepy Camera
angles...-10 Highly recommended...
