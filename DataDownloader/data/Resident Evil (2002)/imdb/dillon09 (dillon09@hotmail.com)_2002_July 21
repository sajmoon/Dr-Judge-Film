The first thing I'd like to say is I've never played the video game so I
can't judge how good or how bad it is compared with that. As film
adaptations of vid games go it is one of the better ones I've seen, but it
has so many bits of other things in it. You have echoes of The Cube, the
Matrix, Ghosts from Mars, The Relic, and obviously any of the Romero Zombie
films.
Nonetheless it still has it's good bits. The score is excellent, there are
bits in it that you know what is coming up and you're prepared for it and
you still jump when it happens. The action is pretty non stop and the
performances of the characters is good.
If you liked any of the films mentioned above, then you'll probably like
this one to, a hell of a lot better than things like Mortal Kombat and Wing
Commander. The only thing I wonder is what it would have been like if Romero
had stayed involved. A bit of a six pack and curry flick, but still a good
curry nonetheless.
