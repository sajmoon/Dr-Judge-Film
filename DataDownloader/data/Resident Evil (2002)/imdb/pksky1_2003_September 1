Trailers for this movie heavily emphasized nasty things featured in digital
animation, but don't be fooled.  It is basically a flesh eating zombie
movie.  Our most typical problems are wandering undead lab workers attacking
our heroes.  Sound familiar?  Maybe you play &quot;Half Life&quot; on your computer
like I do.<br /><br />If you've been waiting for &quot;Half Life&quot; to come to the movie screen, you
should enjoy this as much as I did.  There is much that is familiar and
admiration for that computer game is evident in this film.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich is the hero in this film.  I first confused her with Natasha
Henstridge who was in &quot;Species&quot;.  This is not her.  (Try &quot;The Messenger:
Joan of Arc&quot;)  But, she gives the film a lot of dignity when the plot fails
to deliver.  Mostly the plot is OK once you are resigned to the mutant
zombie theme.  And of course the undead is not all there is to
it.
