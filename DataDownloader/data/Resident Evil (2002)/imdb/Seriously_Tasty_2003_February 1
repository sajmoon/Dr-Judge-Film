This film was actually funny. I found myself laughing at how badly made it
is (the CGI cut-outs looked like a simple copy-paste job). The dialogue
was
rubbish, as was the acting, and don't mention the soundtrack.<br /><br />Was it scary? Not in the slightest. Surely even the most dedicated horror
movie fan must realise how bad this film is. I wonder how much the budget
on
the film was. I was given the impression that it was a high-budget film,
but
it leaves me wondering what area of the film all the cash was used to
create.<br /><br />On the other hand, the commentary was very funny.<br /><br />*<br /><br />1/10
