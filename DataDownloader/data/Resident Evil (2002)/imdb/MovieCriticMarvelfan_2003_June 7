I want to go see it when it came out and a friend of
theater let me see for free and thank God. Although
&quot;Resident Evil&quot; was entertaining to an extent it was
also very laughable, and not &quot;Bloody Fantastic&quot; and
someone said it's &quot;Bloody Idiotic&quot; is more like it.<br /><br />The first big thing is that the movie DOES NOT FOLLOW
THE GAME, not even half of it, the only
part they got right is the zombies and virus
but that's it. Speaking of that
the zombie effects and actors are utterly
pathetic. I haven't seen Zombies this
cheap since George Romero's &quot;Dawn Of the Dead&quot;.<br /><br />This all considered it was downhill from there, but
entertaining. However, not even
the real characters from the game are here:
Claire Redfield, Chris Redfield, etc.
Not a damn one.<br /><br />Then at the end of the film the writers desperately
try to tie in the &quot;Nemesis&quot; game of Resident
Evil 3, with this. Doesn't work.<br /><br />However, this cheap ending is also
basically to an extent the same ending
as &quot;Matrix Reloaded&quot;.<br /><br />What a surprise, a movie loaded with great special
effects with no story. Haha.<br /><br />Don't bother wasting money on DVD either.
