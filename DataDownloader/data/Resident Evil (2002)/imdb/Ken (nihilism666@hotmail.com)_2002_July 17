As I have been following the computer games since 1996 I was highly
anticipating the Resident Evil Movie. Though after Tomb Raider I worried
that it would turn out to be rubbish. However...Resident Evil turned out to
be the best film I've seen this year.
The movie starts at a very fast pace, missing out on lenghty
conversations and concentrating on plenty action. A very good thing.
Infact,
the movie rarely does stop for talk as there always seems to be something
going on to keep your interest. The movies excellent techno/ rock score
really brings out the drama in the scenes and theres the odd scare
throughout the does make you jump.
The plot wasnt lame, managing a few twists that builds up to great
ending.
Whether you like Resident Evil or not, watch this movie, you wont regret
it.
