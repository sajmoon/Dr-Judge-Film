&quot;Resident Evil&quot; is one of my all-time favorite movies. It ranks up
there with the &quot;Matrix&quot; trilogy, the &quot;Bourne&quot; series (&quot;Bourne Identity&quot;
and &quot;Bourne Supremacy&quot;), and &quot;Kill Bill&quot; volumes 1 and 2. As soon as I
got out of the theater after seeing it for the first time, I knew I was
going to buy it as soon as it hit DVD.<br /><br />It is definitely a very &quot;cool&quot; movie. I liked how the plot developed.
It didn't just go in shootin' up everything. It had a story to tell,
and told it well. The characters are cool. The music is great! It is
well placed within the movie and adds to the atmosphere of the film. I
really liked the look and atmosphere of the film. There is an uneasy
and spooky feel. There are some classic moments that help make it a
unique zombie movie. Plus, the explanation of why there are zombies is
better than any other one from the other zombie movies.<br /><br />The &quot;brief sexuality/nudity&quot; is not graphic or tasteless. It actually
helps with the story. Plus, it is very &quot;brief.&quot; The gore is not
excessive.<br /><br />It is a pretty spooky movie the first time you see it. It remains
&quot;cool&quot; every time you watch it.<br /><br />Since &quot;Resident Evil&quot; is so &quot;cool&quot;, I am extremely excited about its
sequel, &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse.&quot;
