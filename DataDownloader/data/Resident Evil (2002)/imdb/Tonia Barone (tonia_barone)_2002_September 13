I was surprised. I'm a pretty big fan of the games (though I've only
played
2, I've seen the others being played. Well, except one. Missed most of
that
one) and been waiting for this film for a while. But I was worried it'd be
like other game-to-movie adaptations. Luckily, my fears were unfounded.
Milla is in top form in this movie. I didn't catch her C's name but she
was
a good stand-in C for Jill. Though the hellhounds were a tad off, the rest
was perfect.
