I never play video games, so I have no attachment to the theme. I saw
the sequel a year ago and thought it was lame and derivative, though I
liked Milla. I also thought she was the best part of &quot;The Fifth
Element&quot;, acting against one of the worst movie killers of all time,
Bruce Willis. (OK, he put in a few good roles here and there.) So, I
got the DVD of RE and it blew me away. The production value was far
superior to almost any of those techno-cyber-man-vs-computer flicks,
along with it being better than most zombie and action movies in
general. It had the same sort of set and theme as the original 70&#39;s
techno-science thriller, &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot;. The acting and
characters were spartan but right on cue. Though most of the team
members tended to look alike, they all had some personality and acted
more like real people than some soul-less, Ahnuld type killing
machines. Milla&#39;s body language was excellent, and she was sexy without
hamming it up an ounce. She deserved an Oscar and is a pleasure to
watch. THough the one scene where she kicks out the mutant dog was
lame. <br /><br />Her character suffered from amnesia due to a nerve agent in the
beginning and there was a dream like sequence when she awakes on the
floor of her shower and is utterly blank. That scene was filmed in a
huge German mansion that the Nazis and Communist used for a retreat,
done in red, as her skimpy dress she wears. She has to reconstruct her
past while battling zombies, genetically engineered killing animals and
the Red Queen, or the AI program that runs the hive. But she always
maintained her humanity and femininity throughout the horrors she faced
and fought. She was paired with Michelle Rodriguez, doing her macha
latina schtick as one of the security team members. But the two of them
actually complemented each other and it worked well. Michelle Rodriguez
as Rain Ocampo offered up some pretty decent comic relief and lines
too!<br /><br />The sets and mechanical efx are great, but the cgi beasts were weaker.
The cinematography and editing were first rate. The soundtrack was
pulsing techno that drove the already good plot along, it was great
too.<br /><br />In short this movie set a benchmark for all those
cyber-mutant-techno-action-zombie movies that few will beat. Throw us
the action, but at least have real people and great but spare efx. It&#39;s
sequel, of course, was a turkey compared to this. It was made in
Europe, which explained it&#39;s good techno style, Funny, but my man
George A. Romero was supposed to direct it, but gave up. I don&#39;t think
it would have been as good. Basically, this movie first rate period.
