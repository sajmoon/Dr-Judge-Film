Resident Evil is awesome. It is the best adaption of a video game to a
movie. It is better than Tomb Raider. It doesn't have as many visual effects
but it is still better. Milla Jovovich and Angie are really good action
heroes but i think Milla is just a little better because she is a newer
character. The script for RE is a little better than Tomb Raiders but
neither one of them is very good. Resident Evil is an awesome well
thoughtout movie.
