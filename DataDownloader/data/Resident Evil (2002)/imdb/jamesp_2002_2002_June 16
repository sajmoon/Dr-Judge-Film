I love the RE games and love the Romero zombie flicks, so I was really
looking foward to RE the film.  On the plus side - it looks good, it does
link in with the games and last scene is quite cool.  Negatives - its 40
mins or so before any zombie action, there is far too much looking at
monitors-type stuff and its not very gory.  My hopes of a big budget
zombie
genre revival have been dashed for the moment.  I hope RE:Nemesis does the
job this failed to do.  For me the appeal of the Romero films was the end
of
the world premise, RE evil only touches on this in the last 2 minutes or
so.<br /><br />Overall, its a fair no-brainer and it may be the start of of decent
franchise.  Its not citizen kane and its not even Savini's NOTLD remake,
but
hey, its a zombie film with a big budget, theres another on the way, and
thats ok with me.
