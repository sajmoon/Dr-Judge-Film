2002_August 11 

I refer to this review as &quot;the view of an independent&quot; for the following
reasons: a) Although I have played the game, I was never particularly good
at it and lost interest in it before I got anywhere near completing it.
This
is not because it was a bad game, indeed, I thought it was a very good
game,
it just happens I'm not real big on computer games. b) I'm not a die-hard
Milla Jovovich fan, who's likely to applaud her performance no matter
what.
c) I'm not a self-proclaimed officiado of the horror genre, unlike some
other commentators.<br /><br />To put it another way, you're going to get a broad-based and un-biased
opinion from me, not weighed down by any nerdy loyalty to horror films,
the
computer game or Jovovich's hot body!<br /><br />When I went to see this film I must say I was pretty sceptical. I'm not a
big fan of films based on computer games and thought 'Mortal Kombat' (also
by Paul Anderson) was a pretty good justification for this, but my friend
and I were in a funny mood and thought that the film would probably be, at
least, amusing in a comically gory kind of way and before we went in I did
in fact say &quot;this will probably be crap&quot;.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The crux of the film is that a deadly virus is released in a top secret
underground lab, called The Hive, belonging to the corrupt Umbrella Corp.
Fans of the game will be familiar with the details. Basically, the Red
Queen, a super-computer and the state-of-the-art in A.I., goes &quot;homicidal&quot;
and kills everyone in the Hive.<br /><br />This opening scene is brilliant and sets the tone for the rest of the
film.
Anderson has opted for a much different style than he presented in 'Event
Horizon' (another rather good film), as he presents us with a world that
is
sleek and stylish, almost clinical. It becomes clear at this point that
the
virus has been released deliberately but for what purpose and by whom, we
are left in the dark, for now.<br /><br />After the excellent opening sequence (during which it becomes immediately
obvious that the soundtrack is going to be brilliant) we move on to the
more
familiar setting of the famous Mansion, the emergency entrance into the
Hive. Already Milla Jovovich turns up naked, although this is shot well
and
manages to not seem too gratuitous. Meanwhile the Umbrella Corp. has
dispatched a special-ops unit, armed to the teeth, to investigate the
strange goings on down in the Hive and to establish why the Red Queen
killed
everyone. Leading this predictable band of gun-toting rogues is Britain's
own Colin Salmon, of the most recent Bond films fame. Salmon offers a good
performance and his distinct vocal talents lend themselves well to a
seamless American accent.<br /><br />There is also a good performance from back-up babe Michelle Rodriguez,
playing, as others have said, a &quot;Lara Croft wannabe&quot;. Rodriguez gives a
good, solid performance, although it does rather harken back to Vasquez
from
'Aliens', while not quite managing to recreate the unique appeal of that
character. The rest of the characters, sadly, are rather non-descript,
especially James Purefoy, who plays Jovovich's love-interest and Eric
Mabius. You'll be lucky if you can remember the names of half the
characters
in this film and when you leave the cinema you will be referring to them
as
&quot;the black guy&quot; and &quot;the one that got eaten near the beginning&quot;, etc. Some
people have criticised this lack of character development, stating that,
feeling little empathy for these two-dimensional cardboard cut-outs, you
don't care whether the characters live or die. However, I would argue that
this is an asset, as it means you can sit happily for an hour or so,
watching people get torn to shreds by zombies and not feel too conflicted.
The only other character for whom there is a touch of empathy is that of
Kaplan (Martin Crewes) who spends practically the entire film &quot;about to
die
any minute&quot; and you'll be willing him to live throughout!<br /><br />So Jovovich, wearing a delightfully skimpy outfit, and this motley crew of
ramshackle desperados delve deep into the Hive to confront a psychotic
super-computer, hundreds of flesh-eating zombies and a giant mutant
creature
with a long, razor-sharp tongue. What ensues is plenty of gun fire and
Jovovich ass-kicking. All in all it's pretty entertaining stuff, well shot
and well lit, with an excellent soundtrack (kudos to Marilyn Manson, the
absence of whose whining lyrics provides proof that he actually has some
talent). Don't expect Oscar performances from any of the cast, although I
always think the lack of A-list talent, minus one to put on the
billboards,
is an asset for any film! Just expect a range of non-entities, ready to
get
hacked to bits one by one, led by a couple of sexy, well-armed babes in
knee-high rubber boots!<br /><br />The film is of good quality, although die-hard fans of the horror genre
will
be comparing it to 'Night of the Living Dead', etc. This is a very
different
type of zombie film and comparison should be taken with a pinch of salt.
The
film is faithful to the game, while, thankfully, keeping the zest without
merely recycling what we've already seen. There is plenty of gore but not
so
much that your left reeling by the sickening stupidity of it all! And of
course there's Milla, whose naked scenes, as I said before, are tastefully
done but are still present for the blatant purpose of keeping the lads'
duel
lust for violence and &quot;booty&quot; satisfied. The dialogue has some pretty
awful
cliches, as is to be expected from this genre, but on the whole it's of a
better standard than I've come to expect from horror films.<br /><br />Finally a round of applause for young Michaela Dicker, the voice of the
Red
Queen. Inevitably, the Red Queen has been compared to HAL but God only
knows
why because, apart from both being homicidal super-computers, they bare
absolutely no comparison. Apart from one - the key to the success of both
as
'characters' is the fact that they're not so much &quot;frightening&quot; as they
are
&quot;disconcerting&quot;. In the case of HAL, it was his blatant homo-eroticism, in
the case of the Red Queen it's the fact that she's modeled on a little
girl,
the head programmer's daughter we're told. The sound of a girl, who can't
be
much older than eight or nine, explaining why it was necessary to kill
everyone in the Hive is deeply disturbing and Dicker delivers, by far,
some
of the most memorable quotes from the film, including: &quot;you're all going
to
die down here!&quot; and &quot;I've been a bad, bad girl.&quot;<br /><br />This really is a blokes' film, the kind you'd go see with your mates
rather
than your girlfriend. It all raps up nicely for a sequel (Resident Evil:
Nemesis already in the pipeline) so watch this space.<br /><br />7/10
