Having never played the game myself, I didn't quite know what the film would
be like, but I quite enjoyed it.
 
Milla Jovovich apart from being beautiful is now the holder of the Sigourney
Weaver title of female bad guy ass kicker, and she dominates the sceen when
ever she is on it as I couldn't take my eyes off her, and Michelle Rodriguez
as the fiesty Rain was using her trade mark pout to maximum
effect.<br /><br />On the negative side, the Zombies just were just not scary, and Ive seen
better horror makeup in other films, one zombie I noticed was trying very
hard not to laugh, and the sceen in the tunnel gave me the feeling the
zombie gang, were all waiting off sceen ready for the director to say go
before they all joined the shot.  The laser guard was good, and its special
gory effects was good but the final laser victim of the traditional black
man victim death was a waste of the best of the supporting characters, and
was to brief to be really shocking, but this was understandable given the
films British 15 certificate.  The zombie dogs though were good, and even
gave me at 45 years old a start, and the way Milla took care of them, was in
tune with the films source for action, well done Milla.<br /><br />As for the super baddie licker dog, it was all a bit fast in the train to
get a real good look at it, but it gave off enough evil intent to be the
best of the baddies.<br /><br />The ending sceen was really good, but before that who was the person walking
across the screen before Milla escapes from the hospital, one of the crew? 
The final panoramic sceen sets the tone nicely for a sequel that I'll
probably be going to see.<br /><br />Verdict, just enough gore, a reasonable adherance to the game play, and the
lovely Milla Jovovich, showing lots of flesh and kicking zombie
ass.<br /><br />
