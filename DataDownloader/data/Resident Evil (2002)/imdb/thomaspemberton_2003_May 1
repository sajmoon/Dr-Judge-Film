This had all the ingredients for a disaster, a director whos credits
include
Mortal Kombat &amp; Event Horizon, a cast of unknowns led by a model-turned
actor (Fair Game with Cindy Crawford anyone?) and the the most
ineffective
CGI since Michael Madsen gurned his way through thriller-by-numbers
Species.<br /><br />So imagine my surprise when the fetid debacle i had imagined turned out
the
be a low budget and very effective zombie/shoot em up. All the elements
were
in place from the zombie fodder gung ho lead men and the surly tomboy ala
Michelle Rodreguiz, and it cracks along at a fair place which never lets
up
until the predictable ending.<br /><br />Even the hand-me-down effects are quite endearing and lend a real 1980s
feel
to the film, all it needed was a camp chain-mail villian with porn tache
and
a matching stick chewing action hero who takes his name from a
particularly
venomous snake.<br /><br />8/10
