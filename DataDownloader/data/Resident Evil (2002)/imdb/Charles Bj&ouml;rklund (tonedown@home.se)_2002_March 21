What can i say. This movie won't really leave any lasting impressions. A
very construed storyline, which has you in the dark for the first half of
the movie, but shapes up ok at the end. I'm not a Zombie-lover, but as far
as zombiemovies come, this aint exactly grade A Romero (e.g. Dawn of the
Dead). Still, if you havent got anything better to do, this is a good way
of
killing off a couple of hours. Decent acting, ok action, and some nekkid
ladies for us guys, but almost never really scary.<br /><br />I have purposefully avoided comparisons with the RE franchise of games,
because i believe a movie should be able to stand up on its own, but there
are some nice pointers and in-jokes for those of us who know the games as
well. But not knowing them won't detract from the experience. Come to think
of it, nor would being drunk while viewing it. Not a terribly deep flick at
all.
