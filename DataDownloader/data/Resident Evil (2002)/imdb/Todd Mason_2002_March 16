Despite good-enough performances from Jovovich, Rodriguez, and the rest of
the cast, there is little more good to be said for this film, aside from
some handsomely unhandsome zombies.  Did we need a cross between CUBE and
Romero's zombie trilogy with an even more ridiculous version of ALIEN's
anticorporate slant (when anticorporatism becomes as ridiculous as this, it
certainly undercuts real anticorporatism)?  Nonsensical doubletalk, an
idiot-plot from the beginning, and not even much in the way of interesting
violence.  So, go to see Milla J be fetching and Michelle R be sardonic,
but
you can probably do that with some other films which might also entertain
you.
