Real cool! a must see movie,especially for Resident Evil fans.I thought
that
it was just as exciting for non res fans too.It left me on my seat wanting
the next sequel.I loved the matrix effects.A lot better than I thought it
would be.At first I was afraid that it was going to wind up being one of
those cheesy B-movies, but I was very surprised.Even with the zombies being
a part of the show,the Cerberus (Doberman Pinschers) and Licker(Long tongue
creature) clearly made up for any weakness.All I can say is watch the
movie,and who knows you just might get into playing the whole Resident Evil
series on video game.You won't regret it!
