It may not be the greatest horror movie ever made but it sure has some
scary
moments.  Jovovich is absolutely stunning in the movie and she plays the
part well.  Rodriguez got a little carried away with the &quot;tough&quot; look on
her
face.  I was disappointed when I first heard that this movie had no
characters from the game, however, I was quite pleased at how well the
director captured images from the game.  The last shot of the movie
literally blew me away and took me back to Resident Evil 3:  it was almost
a
perfect picture of the game.  RE fans, see this movie.
