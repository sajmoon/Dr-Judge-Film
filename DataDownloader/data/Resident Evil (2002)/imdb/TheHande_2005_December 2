Rewritten on: 10.9.06<br /><br />Let&#39;s get one thing straight. This film is not a horror-movie.
Horror-movies are lame. Resident Evil is anything but lame.<br /><br />Almost everything about this movie is excellent. The atmosphere kicks
ass and the movie has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard.
The over-all feeling is rather abstract, but not so much that it would
make the film difficult to follow.<br /><br />This film is also not a Zombie-movie in the traditional sense, but more
like an action-thriller...with zombies. As far as movie-monsters go the
Licker was a great piece of work, even if in the earlier scenes it was
a little dumpy-looking. The only other notable point that I may
criticize is that up to the halfway point of the film it perhaps
attempted too many times to startle the viewers which seemed a little
goofy.<br /><br />As a final note, the ending crawl is one of the best I&#39;ve seen in any
film to date. Even if the film&#39;s plot (which I felt was on par with the
games) is nowhere near as good as in Silent Hill, this is still my
personal favorite on the front of video-game films.
