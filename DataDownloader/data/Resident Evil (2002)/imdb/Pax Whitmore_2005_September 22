(This contains minor spoilers) As a fan of action movies, as well as
the zombie genre in particular, I was fairly excited to see this movie.
Sadly, it makes no sense. The plot - if it could be called such a thing
- is only briefly referenced, and the rest of the movie is people
running from poorly-animated creatures, obnoxious music cues (&quot;Let's
take the stairs!&quot; cue exciting, techno music for the ten seconds of
climbing down stairs), and awkwardly-placed flashbacks. Poor acting
from people who should know better, cheesy dialogue and short-sighted
directing from Paul WS Anderson, who should but obviously doesn't. My
favorite moment in the entire film is when our heroes are completely
surrounded by zombies in a tunnel with no way out. Anderson wisely cuts
to a shot of an unrelated empty hallway and cuts back to the characters
having made some sort of miraculous escape.<br /><br />And of course, there's the ending, where the enjoyable Jason Isaacs
makes a good-sport-style cameo in a rather pointless scene that doesn't
appear to connect with anything we've just witnessed, including a
creature that would make a Harryhausen stop-motion flick look like Lord
of the Rings. Good job, all around. I'll avoid the sequel.
