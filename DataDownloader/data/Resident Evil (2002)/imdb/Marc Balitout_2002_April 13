First of all: this is no George A. Romero film. That means, do not expect
overly digging in people's intestines. Also, don't look for political
metaphores or an indictment of bio-genetic sciences. It's just a classic
PC-Game transferred onto the big screens. And for that, &quot;Resident Evil&quot; is
one hell of a movie!<br /><br />So, what could you expect when Paul W.S. Anderson went on filming this
picture? Here's a director who is not really known for his cineastic
masterpieces. Also, the script strictly hangs on to &quot;Alien&quot;-regulations.
But
for once, Mr. Anderson manages to prevail. The plot screams for action,
not
for significance or character development. From the first moment, the
movie
is just pure adrenalin.<br /><br />Both Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez, are known as talented and
attractive actresses. They don't have to prove anything, so they don't
start
doing Shakespeare where no overly acting is required. You just feel, that
they had much fun during the shooting, and they operate excellent, with
Rodriguez as the Vasquez-like exterminatrice and Jovovich as Alice, left
in
a nightmarish wonderland. Besides, they both are refreshingly
sexy!<br /><br />When I saw the movie in my favourite cinema in Berlin, it had the whole
audience at the edge of their seats from the first scene. I'm pleased that
all the scary scenes work without too much brain ripping and blood
spilling.
It's a straight and entertaining horror-movie, with a music score that is
just a bit too extreme. But I strictly recommend it too anyone who waited
all these years to finally see a good zombie-movie again.
