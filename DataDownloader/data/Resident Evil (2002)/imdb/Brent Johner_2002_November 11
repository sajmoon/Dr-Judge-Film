A young woman is forced by circumstances to save the world in a slinky
evening gown. She fails to do so, however, and finds she must try again --
this time dressed only in a paper towel.<br /><br />Traditional zombie fare with some high tech mixed in to keep the story
contemporary. Zombies in this movie are created by an engineered virus
instead of the usual supernatural force.
