I've got to write something to at least slightly counter the bad vibes
people are putting out about this film.<br /><br />No it's not the scariest film ever made, I'll give that, and maybe it's not
like the game, but who gives a shit.  But the production values are great,
the acting is good.  Milla and Michelle kick arse, look good doing it and
they can act.  It's a pity the only strong male character, the squad leader
(name?) got sliced and diced.  Oh and the CGI isn't top of the line, but who
gives a rats, seeing the strings in Blakes 7, Dr who, Thunderbirds or the
matte lines in the Star Wars never stopped anyone except the anal from
enjoying them.  I didn't even know what this film was about before i saw it,
so i was rolling around on the floor in fits when i realised it was a zombie
film, but i quickly composed myself and got into the swing of it and enjoyed
it.<br /><br />Yeah, I liked it and there I stand.
