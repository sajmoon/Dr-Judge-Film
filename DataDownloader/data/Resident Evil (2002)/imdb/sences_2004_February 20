Maybe you think that this rating is high, but it's too low for such a high
quality movie.
Great camerawork, full of action, very realistic(could happen if such
stuff
is made)and good story, scary, magnificent headcharacter and the movie
doesn't stay in your head when it's done(so sensible people don't get
nightmares). For me this is one of the most interesting movies i saw(and i
saw a lot)and if someone starts 'about movies making out of videogames is
easy'. Watch streetfighter and Mortal Combat, great videogames but the
movies are not so good. The characters are maybe created but they have to
be
changed perfectly before they could play a realistic role in a movie. In
this movie it is like that. 8,5/10 is my rate.
