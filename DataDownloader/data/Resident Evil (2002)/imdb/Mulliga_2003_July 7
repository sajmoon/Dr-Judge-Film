&quot;Resident Evil,&quot; truth be told, isn't good. It's not the worst
videogame-to-movie adaptation (&quot;Super Mario Brothers&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter&quot;
share the title) around, but it WAS the one with the most
potential.<br /><br />George Romero was slated to direct, bringing his zombie/monster horror
sensibilities to what seemed like a movie destined for him. Unfortunately,
the suits pulled the plug, and what you see now is a pale shell of what
could have been.<br /><br />The problem with &quot;Resident Evil&quot; is that it is basically an action movie
masquerading as a horror movie. Anyone's who's played the game knows that RE
is more about suspense and shock than blowing away/running away from armies
of zombies. Add in the technoshlock/flashbacks/muted characterization
typical in so many Hollywood movies and you've got a dud. A distracting,
somewhat entertaining dud, but a dud nonetheless.<br /><br />2 out of 4 stars.
