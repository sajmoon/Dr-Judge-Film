Anyone who's into video games should see this movie. It really shows
it's displays of horror, gore and violence. Yet, in was also intriguing
and entertaining in the process. Milla Jovovich did very well playing
Alice, the main character in the movie. I liked the part when the dogs
attacked her and she shot them all down. Finding out that marital
status isn't all it's cracked up to be would be a big factor, but it
is. That trap the computer did was awesome, and the virus that spread
out in the place was something too. At the end I would know that Alice
would be ready to face another challenge being thrown to her. And
she'll just get that! This movie isn't for everyone, only the strong
should try it.<br /><br />Rating: VIDEO GAMERS ONLY 5 STARS! 8.5 OUT OF 10!
