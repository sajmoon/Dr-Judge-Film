I just got back from seeing this movie and I can say it was like the first
time I played the original on the ps1.  It is spooky, surprising, gory, and
action filled.  It tries better than any game to movie to keep to the
original story. It has the train from RE2 the mansion from RE1 zombies,
dogs, and umbrella as well as a couple other surprises from the games.  If
you like to be scared, shocked and surprised  or if your girlfriend easily
is, then check this one out.
