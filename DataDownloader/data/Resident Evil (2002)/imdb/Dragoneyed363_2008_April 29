Not my favorite zombie movie,had flaws,some acting was poor,but still
was one great time!!!!!Resident Evil was really good,and had wonderful
action,nice mild-gore scenes,and the acting was pretty well.I first
thought when I was watching this film that it was going to be an
over-the-top gore movie with way to much blood and carnage,not so much
as focusing on the main point of the story,but it turned out
unimaginably well,for I thought it wasn&#39;t going to be THAT good at
all.Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez acted wonderfully in this
film,and although it didn&#39;t turn out the way i&#39;d had hoped it
would,this was still a great action\horror movie that I am extremely
glad I was able to have seen.
