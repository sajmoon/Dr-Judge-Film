I along with my friends found this movie disappointing. Being an avid RE
gamer, I maybe expected too much. I wanted to see Leon, Claire, Jill and
co,
instead I was confronted by a raggle taggle bunch of camera friendly
nonetities. There just wan't enough of anything, not enough zombies, not
enough demon dogs, and do me a favor, one Licker?? They should have taken
a
leaf out of Romero's book and thrown us into a world of paranoia, suspense
and claustrophobia. Instead all we get is an extended MTV promo. The movie
opened promisingly enough, with the &quot;laser&quot; chamber, but then just slid
into
mediocrity and blandness. I also agree with a previous reviewer, the
script
was abysmal and the acting was poor too. They should have left this movie
to
the Japanese to make. If their's a sequel I hope they learn from their
mistakes, and also decide to make it an 18 rated and not cop out! More
gore
please, less &quot;style&quot;.
