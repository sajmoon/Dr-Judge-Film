If movies are all about entertainment, this is one of the most successful
films in history! The best action-fest I've come up against since ALIENS,
to
which it owes more than a nod!<br /><br />Absolutely the best video-game to movie transfer yet made. If it bears but
a
passing resemblance to the game itself, well who the hell cares? The
simplistic plot is ideal for those with limited attention spans. The
underground corporation-run sub-city experimental lab is thrown into
disarray when a virus forces the &quot;Hive's&quot; CPU to shut down prematurely. A
lot of people die most graphically. Another ALIENS type elite commando team
(complete with an APONE look-alike) are sent in to &quot;rescue&quot; Milla Jovovich
who for a while has no idea what the hell she is doing there, plus
whomsoever they can rescue before they hope to kick-start the central
computer who is playing some really innovative and rogue games with both
the
intruders and the audience.<br /><br />Mutant victims with more than a touch of the &quot;Living Dead&quot; cannibalise
their
rescuers one by one. Jovovich in easily her best role to date (are those
the
sexiest lips in screen history or what?) high kicks her oppressors and
unbelievably well digitised Doberman reconstructs with flair and accuracy.
There is simply no let-up throughout the movie which with the decibal
screaming Dolby sound and rock-soundtrack just all dovetails together
seamlessly.  State of the art FX enhance this
adrenaline-pumping scifi caper and propel it into the stratosphere.<br /><br />As good a horror/sci-fi/zombie flick as you are ever likely to see with one
all time mother of a jaw-snapping monster yet devised. Makes the Alien
Queen
look like a sedated kitten!<br /><br />This is one mad movie with a kick-ass direction and totally awesome action
sequencing! Check out the dicing-death by laser-grid! This was mega-cool!
I
went straight back into the theater and watched it at the next
session!
