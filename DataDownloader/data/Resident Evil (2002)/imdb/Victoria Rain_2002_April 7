Resident Evil is a great horror movie. It was amazing! The zombies freaked
me out, the dogs were very scary, and the other thing was scary. Michelle
Rodriguez did a great job as Rain. I liked her tough attitude. Milla
Jovovich was great as Alice. Rain was always tough and never scared but it
would have helped if we knew more about her. Alice was always trying to
help
out and beat zombies. The movie takes you through a chilling look at &quot;The
Hive&quot; after the deadly T-virius infects everybody down there. The comando
team has three hours to stop the virius from infecting the whole world.
They
also come upon some incredible things. If you want a movie to scare you
out
of your seat, then you might want to watch Resident Evil.
