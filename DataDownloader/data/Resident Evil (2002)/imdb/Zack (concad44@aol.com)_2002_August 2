Let me say that I am a HUGE fan
of the games.  I even played Resident Evil: Survivor and if you have
played this, you know what I mean.  All right, to the movies credit, I
thought the sets were awesome.  The sets really conveyed the corrupt
corporation image and I loved the gritty white color scheme the set
designer used.  Also, I too enjoyed the beginning very much.  It grips
you right from the start and I thought it was a great way to kick off
the movie.  However, from there on it pretty much goes right off track.
The acting is horrendous.  I have no idea how anyone would fine the
characters &quot;well-developed&quot; as they acted as they they didn't even want
to be there most of the time.  I felt no connections whatsoever to them
and found nearly every line of dialouge humorously misspoken or just out
of place althogether.  On top of that, the characters looked like they
saw zombies everyday of their life.  I didn't believe anyone was scared
for a second.  And if the characters aren't scared, why the heck should
I be?  Now, like I said, I love the games.  Obviously, the makers of
this film wanted to attract the fan-base of the game series.  So why in
the WORLD did they deviate so far from the games storyline???  They
didn't even include the characters from the game!  I would have been
happy if they had just had the charcters names and were completely
different.  Ok, maybe not happy, but Id buy it.  OK, back to something I
liked.  I really do think that there were some interesting ideas in this
movie.  I really thought the ending was cool, BUT it actually made me
mad because it could have been so much better if Milla Jovavich's
character had been better developed.  I didn't really care that she
survived (Oh, come on, you know she did, I'm not giving away anything).
All that aside though, I will see the sequel.  I'm too much a fan of the
games.  I just hope the director Anderson or whatever gets his act
together and quits trying to make another Aliens.
