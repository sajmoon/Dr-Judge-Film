Resident Evil was a suprise in that it is a rather good film.  Milla
Jovovich helps this by being easy on the eye.  The action was fairly well
paced with some good scenes that made you jump and it was also great to see
a lot of the chracters from the game, we did not see enough of the dogs.  I
felt where the movie mis-fired slightly was that it had a subplot with
Milla's character and few others suffering memory loss.  I don't feel it
added to the movie just made you think what's going on.  I would have
prefered a straight forward action film in the vain of Aliens where she
takes the role of Jill Valentine.  That would have rocked.  The ending is
left wide open for the sequel, let's just hope that this is the direction
they go in for that one.
