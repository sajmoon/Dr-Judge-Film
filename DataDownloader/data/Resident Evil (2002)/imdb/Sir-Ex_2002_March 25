Resident Evil was not a good movie.<br /><br />I watched this movie not being a fan of the game, but a huge fan of
zombie-killing movies in general.  I was expecting more from Resdient Evil
than the other videogame movies.  Although Resident Evil was better than
said movies, that's not saying much.  Since it was an 18a movie, I was
expecting some gruesome scenes.  Instead, I was presented with some cheesy
laser cutting action, which unrealisticaly seemed to go right through the
guys, leaving no identifiable burns.  It would have been a lot nicer to
see
some sizzles and cracks, or maybe to see that dudes intestines fall out as
he jumped up.  But unfortunatley, the movie quickly moves away from any
images of real gore.  To me, this was pretty bad, considering this was
supposed to be a zombie killing movie.<br /><br />The movie also had some confusing parts.  Twice the main character, played
by Milla Jovovich (which may have been the only really good part of this
movie) was surrounded by zombies and it seems there is no hope, when
suddenly she appears climbing up a ladder away from them, or closing a
door
on them.<br /><br />The zombies themselves were not that great either.  The movie totally
abandoned the style that I can even respect in the game.  There were no
axes, knives, chainsaws, flamethrowers, or other such weapons of violence.
Instead the victims used guns to create small little holes in the zombies
that did nothing.  The makeup of the zombies wasn't anything out of the
ordinary either.<br /><br />Some people have said that the story matters more in Resident Evil.  Um,
but
the story isn't that great either.  Just another cliched example of the
all
powerful evil bioweaponry cooporation.  And if I wanted a story, I'd read
a
book.<br /><br />Resident Evil is the perfect example of how someone can mix a beautiful
woman, zombie killing action, a creepy mood, and a heavy metal soundtrack
and somehow manage to corrupt and detract from each element to create a
5/10
star movie at best.
