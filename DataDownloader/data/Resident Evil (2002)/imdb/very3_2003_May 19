I thought there were some very effective scary scenes in this
movie!
like when the power went down and the doors opened up releasing the
zombies.
you dont see them, you just see the a slight movement of shadows on the
wall
near the open doors, the part where that guy was listening intently at the
air vent up in the ceiling and he could hear the moaning and screaming
from
the zombies way in the distance....creepy.   ok, the dog scene should have
been deleted. it was really hokey. I thought the zombies looked scary as
hell.
I was also really touched by that hot woman in the movie. she really
seemed
to care about the others around her, whereas in most other monster movies
its everyone for themselves.that special forces latino woman was getting
on
my nerves. I mean they all knew what they were getting into, they I am
sure
had some data that a deadly virus was involved, yet she walks right up to
obviously infected zombies and gets bitten! come on! also,the guy at the
end
who got scratched, instead of saying COME ON! give me that cure for the
virus shot he and she start babbling wasting precious time. I would have
demanded that shot right after getting bitten or sliced. not wait till
everything was A ok!
