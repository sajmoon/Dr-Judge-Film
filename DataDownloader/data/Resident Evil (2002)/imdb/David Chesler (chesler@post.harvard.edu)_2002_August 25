I like my monsters to make sense.  I suppose if I were familiar
with
the video game I'd understand, or at least have gotten over
asking,
why things were the way they were.<br /><br />Why would zombies feed on humans instead of on whatever it
was
they ate when they were still human?<br /><br />Mutation is not the same as shape-shift.<br /><br />Why have a bunch of scrap steel pipe just hanging around
a
personnel transport except that the director has a plan
for
that prop later on?<br /><br />I will give points for a confusing situation (the viewer
and
the amnesiacs never quite sure who are the good guys and
who
are the enemies) and an overpoweringly unconventional ending.
