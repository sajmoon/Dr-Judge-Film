Wow, a film about a game made by people who actually played the RE games.
Paul Anderson made an intelligent move by insisting everyone in his cast
and
crew to either play the game or watch videos of people playing the game
to
get a feel for what he wanted to capture.  Not to mention the main
members
of the cast were RE fanatics, at last a game-to-film that keeps very
consistent and has the same feel of the game itself.<br /><br />But Resident Evil wasn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination so
some
of the flaws carried over.  For instance, a creature that debuted in
RE2--'the licker' who did have a classic introduction, but the damn thing
itself was a lousy rip-off of a much more intimidating beast known as
'the
hunter'.  But the hunter's appearance was far less impressive, which
usually
left most gamers underestimating the thing.  Two seconds later you're
restarting your game, vowing not to let another hunter breath.  The last
boss was nothing compared to two hunters; no questions
asked.<br /><br />Also Resident Evil's trademark cheesy lines, a few outrageous scenes (who
kicks a dog in the mouth and sends it through a window, rendering it
unconscious?)  But hey, you expect a certain level of cheese with horror
. .. I mean hell, every Friday the 13th is 100% cheesy and it's one of the
stronger series in terms of fanbase (as much as I hate to admit that.)<br /><br />Paul Anderson brings the claustrophobic, creepy, yet high tech atmosphere
he provided Event Horizon with into Resident Evil.  Once again using a
great
deal of subtleties until the last half of the film.  As he said in the
commentary, `This is a movie about Resident Evil, you know you're going
to
see zombies so you don't have to show them up front and right away.'
Which
better builds the tension, because the whole time we don't see the
Zombies,
we know they're somewhere, and we know they're coming.<br /><br />Alfred Hitchcock is quoted as saying, `A bomb under the table goes
off-that's surprise.  A bomb under the table, and it doesn't go
off-that's
suspense.'  One you can come back to, and still get a similar feeling.
The
other, once you know it's there it leaves you empty ever
after.<br /><br />Marco Beltrami and Marylyn Manson both surprised me by providing a
tolerable score.  Beltrami breaks from his typical style, which I don't
care
for, to capture the sound and feel of the RE games.  Not a bad score to
listen to while watching.
