After having just seen RE, and being a HUGE fan of the video games since
their inception, I will say that this movie wasn't bad.  It wasn't great
like the video games though.  Everything in the movie was very
professionally done and the F/X looked great!  However, the movie lacked
what the video game provided, and that is a sense of horror...of genuine
fright.  I am a 30 year old male, and when I first started playing RE I
would avoid playing the games at night...cause...well...I'm sure you get the
picture.  The movie had nearly none of that terror or suspense.  Sure, there
was some parts but on the whole it was a little dissappointing.  I would
have preferred that the movie stay in either the urban areas of Racoon City
(ie., RE2, RE3), instead of the movie created &quot;Hive&quot;.  It was an interesting
idea thought and might have been better had it been fleshed out a little bit
more.  Anyways, this is a entertaining movie and most fans of RE should
enjoy.  Oh, and Milla is superfreakin hot in this.  WOW!!
