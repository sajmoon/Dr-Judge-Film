An all new story beginning before RE1 and ending around the beginning to
middle of RE2.  Definitely captures the feel and tension of the game.  The
eerie (and fitting) horror soundtrack by Marilyn Manson heightens the
tension.  Lots of good moments that make the viewer jump in their seat.
You
also get to see A LOT of Milla in this.  Lots of tips of the hat to players
of the game, you will notice quick shots of similar rooms and cameos of
characters from the game.  This film, while light on plot, does make use of
it's R rating.  Definitely the best video game to movie conversion ever and
the best horror film in several years.  Recommended.
