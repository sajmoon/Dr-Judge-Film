This film is extremely bad... among the worst I've ever seen.  But I loved
it anyway.  The script was just terrible.  I mean, the plot is extremely
flimsy, not one character in the film is worthy of the term, and the whole
thing is just a big budget excuse to to make a movie about zombies.  It
doesn't have any of the tension of the original video game,   it doesn't
have any of the characters of the original game, and, in fact, it bears
remarkably little resemblance to the game at all.  <br /><br />Some people seem to think it's a prequel to the game.  I don't understand
how that works, exactly.  I mean, the end of the movie looks exactly like
the beginning of Resident Evil 2 (the game), so it's a prequel to the game's
sequel.  I don't know.  But don't think about it.  Just enjoy the cheese. <br /><br />Like that elevator scene in the beginning.  Tremendous.  So bad you can't
help but love it.  The whole audience cheered when that happened.  Great. <br /><br />Just to illustrate how little this film cared about it's characters, I'd
like to point out that Alice's name is never mentioned on screen until the
final credits.  I actually stayed in the theater and waited because I wanted
to know her name.  Apparently, she didn't want to know.  Because even after
meeting someone she believed knew her, she didn't ask.  Of course, that begs
the question why was she suffering amnesia at all?  From a production point
of view, it's a convenient (if hackneyed) way to introduce suspense.  Or
maybe, since the story was so bad, they wanted to conceal it from the
audience for as long as possible.  So, give your protagonist amnesia, and
suddenly, none of the characters know what's going on, so the story doesn't
present itself to the audience until long after the zombie brain-munching
buffet has begun.  But, from a fictional point of view, why would the
computer have done that?  Trust me, though, that is absolutely the smallest
one of many, many plot inanities.  <br /><br />This movie it truly wretched.  Unless you have a soft spot for big-budget
b-movies starring talented actors masquerading as vacuous eye-candy, stay
far far away.  <br /><br />But like I said, I loved it.
