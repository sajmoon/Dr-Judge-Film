Im REALLY picky with films. Out of the whole of last year about the only
movie I really loved was Lord of the rings. THIS movie is FANTASTIC! I
just
cant understand why its getting so poor reviews! Its not about amazing
chit
chat. Deep plots. Its a well directed, tense horror movie. Its really very
well directed and stylish. Very tense, it kept me on the edge of my seat
the
whole time. Im looking forward to Resident Evil 2 :) Oh and one last thing
I
have been boiling in me for YEARS! The famous Romero moives. THEY ARE NOT
INTELLECTUAL OK???? Those movies have NO sub plot. They are just cheap
horror films about guys roaming around going
Geeeeerrrrr...brarrrrrraaaaaaaains.
LIVE WITH IT! hhhh Hhhhh hhhh HHhhhh lol That said, I do like actually
like
them! lol Give Resident Evil a chance, turn off the lights, turn off your
brain. Enjoy :)
