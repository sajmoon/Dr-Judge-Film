comparing Resident Evil to 28 Days Later is like comparing plastic to
gold.
plastic has basically no value, but in taiwan, they make simple little toy
cars from it with which you can entertain yourself for a minute or two.
get
my drift?<br /><br />as i see it, Resident Evil has ONLY ONE BIG FLAW: it takes itself TOO
SERIOUSLY. come on, it must have been obvious to all the people involved
that this was going to be trash? then why not go all the way? there's just
no way this movie with it's sorry excuse for a stolen storyline would have
made a serious movie.<br /><br />there are A FEW COMICAL SCENES (Michelle Rodriguez feeding the zombies was
pretty neat) that go into the right direction. but can you imagine how
much
more fun this would have been, had they actually made a full out spoof, a
parody out of it? then they could have scrapped the long, boring dialogue
about immoral corporations (which i fast-forwarded through - we're not
watching this for UNMOTIVATED SOCIAL COMMENTARY).<br /><br />the script is LAUGHABLE and the cast delivers a HORRIBLE performance. just
by pushing it a little bit further, the mostly UNINTENDED COMEDY could
have
become a cool stylistic device. but then again, not every bad horror movie
can be a Starship Troopers.
