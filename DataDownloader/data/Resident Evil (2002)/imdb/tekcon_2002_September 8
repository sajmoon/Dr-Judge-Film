2002_September 8 

Being a fan of the game series since it was first released on Playstation,
and a knowledge of story--- I don't know what happened to this film.  The
movie starts off with promise, nice little exposition, and a state of
confusion... but the real confusion comes in when the actual plot starts.
Not to give parts of the movie away, but the character developement was
&quot;eh.&quot;  Really didn't care for anyone to live or die.  The zombie effects
were a poor, by just giving them contacts, and painting their skin a bit
blue tone.  I didn't get the same chill from these zombies, compared to
the
ones in the Video Game.  A lot of the connection to scenes (maybe deleted
footage?), but people went from point A to D, without explaining how they
got past the zombies in B and C.  The film would have made me happy if
they
would have ended it at a certain point, but they had to go on to say
&quot;Sequal&quot;.  Highlights though, include a &quot;nice&quot; score, and great sets.  If
your looking for it to be close to the game experience, just play the
Remake
for GameCube.  If your looking for a zombie chiller, watch some of George
A.
Romero films.
