&quot;RESIDENT EVIL&quot; was a scary video game.  The game captured perfectly the
claustrophobic atmosphere of an abandoned mansion, mixing it with the
occasional zombie (or horde of zombies) and some bizarre villains along
the
way.<br /><br />George A. Romero's script for &quot;RESIDENT EVIL&quot; is more like the game.  It
uses the characters from the game, adds some more, and leaves room for a
sequel.  He also involves the giant plant from the first game and the
Tyrant... which I believe is the final baddie in the first game, but I'm
not
sure.<br /><br />The film you can go to the theatre to see, though, is far different from
the
game.  Characters are different, for one.  The movie also creates a
prequel
and combines it with details from the first game.  The sequel seems to
involve details from games two and three, as the ending mentions details
and
exact location replicas from both games.<br /><br />This is the part of the movie I really enjoyed.  Anderson's script
quenched
my thirst for a connection to the game.  It's cool when a writer can throw
in something to please the diehard fans, and Anderson dd just
that.<br /><br />The movie, though, is okay.  Some details seem reminescent of &quot;CUBE,&quot; and
one section actually copies the film's opening death exactly.  Jovovich
and
Rodriguez are both good, but the latter needs to stop scowling like she
did
in &quot;GIRLFIGHT&quot;.<br /><br />All-in-all, I liked the film that was produced.  I would have rather
watched
Romero's script, as it involves a hell of a lot more details than
Andeson's.
But I'm still eager to see the sequel, as I enjoyed this reimagining very
much.
