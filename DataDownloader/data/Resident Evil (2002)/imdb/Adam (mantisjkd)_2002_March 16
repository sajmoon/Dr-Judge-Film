I almost didn't see this film on opening night, I didn't think it was
going
to be that great...was I surprised! This movie was well made, the acting
was
great (of course anything Milla does is terrific). There was great action,
adn the suspence was amazing. This is deffinatly a movie I would see again
at the theatre, and that doesn't happen very often! The Story was well
thought out, the cenemotography was great, they made a movie about flesh
eating dead people and still made it realistic, GREAT MOVIE!! If you
haven't
seen it, go get your keys and run to see it........
