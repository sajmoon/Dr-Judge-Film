I really enjoyed Resident Evil for several reasons.  It is set in a very
hi-tech underground lab with lots of dark moody lighting to set the mood
for
the evil to follow.  Without giving too much away of the story line I
loved
the methodical destruction of the team. Milla Jovovich was very believable
as the heroine/zombie killer and even though it's a bit sparse in the plot
department it chugs along at a fair pace, with the fright factor very
high.<br /><br />The thing that impressed me the most was the special effects and
prosthetics
used. The fight scenes were particularly believable and the zombiefication
of the humans was excellent (but look out for the doberman's with the
metal
teeth and no hair - way cool!)<br /><br />Just a word of warning though, this is NOT a date movie or even something
to
watch with your wife. MY poor leg was left bruised from my wife clamping
my
leg at every spooky or scary scene ( and there is quite a lot in this
flick).<br /><br />All in all a good ,gory, kill the zombies movie with a
twist.
