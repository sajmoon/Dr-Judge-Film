2002_August 5 

I suppose having not played the game, the movie was less than exciting for
me. It was interesting, though I did note a few places where the
characters
seemed to act illogically or out of character. Overall an acceptable
movie,
though I would hesitate to put it in the Horror category.. more like Gory
with waay too many jump scenes. There is a big difference twixt being
scared
(which I was looking forward to) and being startled (which is just a waste
of time)!
