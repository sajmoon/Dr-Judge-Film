This is easily the best creature flick to come out in many years. Not since
Aliens have beasties jumped out of the dark (or the corner of your eye) with
more scare value. Sure, the story was clearly written on the back of a
cocktail napkin, but that doesn't mean it's bad in any way. In fact, apart
from the obligatory crawl-through-the-ducts scene the plot is not overladen
with cliches and the twists and turns are not swiftly apparent. The two
ladies in charge, Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodrigez (sorry, can't spell)
are excellent and are an excellent foil for each other. The monsters are
cool and the amount of matrix rip-offs are kept to an acceptable minimum.
All in all, this is a fun film with lots of jumpy moments and healthy
helpings of gore. Expect Night of the Living Dead but with 2 hotties and
some CG, and spend 1 and a half happy hours reacquainting yourself with
zombie night-life.
