First things first, I really like &quot;Resident Evil&quot;. While I can&#39;t
comment on the success of the conversion to a movie as I&#39;ve never
played any of the numerous video games, the film is beautifully shot
and has an urgent pace. It also has a great looking cast, a thumping
soundtrack and plenty of boys&#39; toys.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich is stunning as the heroine, Alice. Whoever thought of
casting Jovovich in this role deserves a bonus. Watching this beautiful
star kick various forms of zombie butt while wearing a short red dress
is a wonderful experience.<br /><br />Anderson&#39;s movies may be accused of being style over substance but
there&#39;s no doubting that &quot;Shopping&quot;, &quot;Event Horizon&quot; and &quot;Resident
Evil&quot; are fantastic examples of eye candy. Every shot is beautifully
composed and the film has a high-budget sheen.<br /><br />8 out of 10. Casio G-Shock fans will be in their element watching this
movie.
