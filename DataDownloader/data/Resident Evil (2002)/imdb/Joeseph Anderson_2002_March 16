This movie was fantastic. It was messed up how Michelle Rodreiguez(Rain)
dies and how Milla Jovavich is the only survivor. Everybody else dies. The
red queen helps them escape and they finally make it to the top. In the
end
they re-open the hive and let the zombies back out into Raccon City. When
Alice( Milla Jovavich) wakes up, everything in Raccoon City is messed
up.
