Flaws and all, Resident Evil manages to be a pretty darn entertaining
picture.  This is one of the first FUN films we've seen all year -- it's
heads and above trash like The Time Machine.  As one might assume -- the
film is full of problems.  For an R rated picture that contains ZOMBIES,
the
film doesn't have nearly enough gore as it should.  Speaking of zombies --
the zombies in this picture could use some work -- terrible make-up at
times.  A good amount of the action scenes are sloppy -- the director just
kind of throws the camera into the carnage and the audience is suppose to
make sense of it all.  The film has a lot of problems like this, but it
still manages to deliver on the goods.  The film benefits from an
amazingly
sexy Milla Jovovich.  She makes the film work much in the same way Angelia
Jolie made Tomb Raider the guilty pleasure it was.  The film also stands
up
pretty well when you compare it to the video games (which I myself am a
fan
of).  Not a very good film, but if you are in the mood for some zombie
killing but a sexpot, like I was -- you probably won't be
disappointed.
