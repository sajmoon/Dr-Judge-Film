Resident Evil (2002) is a movie that's loosely based on the zombie
killing video game series. If you're going to make a movie based upon a
video game at least play it before you decide to write and direct a
movie based on it. I've seen several Japanese zombie flicks that are
not based on the game that are more truer to the original source than
this movie. Leave it up to Paul W. Anderson to take a brilliant concept
and ruin it by making a movie that is so unlike the game. By itself
it's a decent movie. You can take Resident Evil out of the title and it
wouldn't make a difference. This movie wasn't that very good to be
labeled Resident Evil. The brain dead suits at Capcom made a huge
mistake when they let George A. Romero go and hired someone who's never
made a zombie flick. Oh well, that's their problem.<br /><br />Back to the movie. How can you make a zombie movie with sparse views of
head shots? I don't know but the makers of this movie manage to. The
only thing worth while about this film are the first appearance of the
zombies, the music and Milla Jovovich. Other than that it's a complete
waste of time. Go out and watch Junk, Stacy or Wild Zero. At least
you'll have some fun.<br /><br />For Zombie completest only.
