Having never before played the video game, and only having limited knowledge
of it, &quot;Resident Evil&quot; was a great movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film.
Milla Jovovich was spectacular.  Sexy and gorgeous in a cocktail dress
didn't stop her from kicking zombie butt.  The special effects were very
realistic with not a lot of CGI.  The plot is not all transparent like many
action movies.  There are a lot of questions the viewer has during the
movie, but be patient, all will be answered during the course of the film.
The special features and commentary by her, Michelle Rodriguez, Jeremy
Bolt,&gt; and Paul Anderson was intriguing and entertaining.  I usually don't
listen to the commentary, but the two girls were fabulous together,
hilarious, and very impromptu.<br /><br />This movie is definately worth the money to buy.  Forget about renting or
Pay-Per-View, buy it.  You will want to watch it again and again.  I know I
have.
