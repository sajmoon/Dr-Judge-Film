This movie has no beginning, no story and no ending. The dialogs are written
for 3 years hold children and the acting is one of the worst I've seen this
year. But, obviously, nobody hopes that this movie will win a &quot;best zombie
movie&quot; at the academy awards, so I'll say that it rocks.  There is no
reason, but it's my favorite zombie movie this year ;-)
