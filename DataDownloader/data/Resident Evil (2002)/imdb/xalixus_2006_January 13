This movie was a real disappointment. I'm a huge fan of the video games
and I kinda hoped they could make something cool out of it, but instead
they merged random parts from the first and second game, take them out
of their context and mix it all together in a mediocre
'your-average-hollywood-action-movie'.<br /><br />They should have sticked to what happens in the first game and made the
movie from that. Of course you can't make an exact copy, but it would
still be more interesting, provided the producer and director had been
a little more creative.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to see what the Silent Hill movie is going to be
like.<br /><br />My vote: 5/10, barely.
