well, i have to admit, i'm mainly love this movie cuz im the hugest
michelle
rodriguez fan ever, but the movie itself was far better than i expected.
after watching my brother play the game a million times, i thought i knew
what to expect, but it was actually a lot freakier, with a far better
plot
than i thought it would have. michelle rodriguez kicked ass (of course,
yeah!!) as rain, and i totally recommend this movie. i thought it was
awesome.
