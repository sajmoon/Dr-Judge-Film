You know... it's always hard for fans of one media watch their beloved
characters/story line be warped into the big screen.<br /><br />So many comic books turned film have been God-awful... The Punisher, Captain
America, Superman, Batman... they never captured the essence of the comic
book.  We needed a director like Martin Scorsese to direct Batman.  The good
thing is, films based off of comic books have finally come of age with the
coming of Spider-Man, X-Men... and hopefully The Hulk.<br /><br />Video games turned films seem to just be in it's infancy.  We had Super
Mario Bros.  Ugh.  Street Fighter?  Ouch (RIP, Raul Julia... that should not
have been your last film)!  But hey, Resident Evil wasn't bad!!  And look,
Silent Hill is on the horizon!!  I think video game films will only get
better and better from here!!<br /><br />Besides, Milla looked great in this flick!
