RESIDENT EVIL (2002) **1/2 Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, Eric Mabius,
James Purefoy, Colin Salmon, Marisol Nichols, Joseph May.  Action-packed,
high-octane no-brainer &#145;adaptation' of eponymous video game sensation with
babes Jovovich and Rodriguez leading a mission to fight off a mysterious
manufactured virus that turns its victims into flesh hungry zombies.  Lite
graphic moments of carnage and ass-kicking pyrotechnics married with
state-of-the-art computer generated images can't save the film in the end
run but it's entertaining in spite of its comic book aspirations.  (Dir:
Paul W.S. Anderson)
