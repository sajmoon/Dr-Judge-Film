i have been waiting to see this movie for long enough, and when i
finally got round to seeing it, i wasn't let down. yeah sure there are
many people out there who say that this was a waste and that the acting
was bad! but what i say is, do you think you could actually do any
better, the answer is no! i'm an actor so i should know, as far as i
could see the acting was flawless and just what the movie needed, where
the movie lacked something the acting always made up for it. Especially
if they had such an actor as Martin Crewes, i mean he's better than
most Hollywood actors! The zombies were better than most movies and
from a actors point of view it was a quite artistically directed.
anyways, that's my opinion. still, this movie did the game justice.
Although it would have been a lot better and more impressive if it had
been given a larger budget.
