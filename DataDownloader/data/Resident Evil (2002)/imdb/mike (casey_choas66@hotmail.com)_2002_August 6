2002_August 6 

After movies like Super Mario Bros, Double Dragon and Tomb Raider showed
that it is not easy to convert video games to the big screen this movie
comes along and prooves that even more true. Great special effects can't
save this mixed bag of action, horro and sci-fi that is neither exciting,
scarey nor innovative. The film slightly succeeds on a &quot;kick ass&quot; level due
to a nice performance from Michelle Rodriguez, but everyone else seems
somewhat miscast. A weak story and even weaker execution make the film
often
confusing and it seems like the filmmakers expected everyone seeing this
movie to have already played the game. This film probably wouldn't have
even
survived the first weeks at the box office without its namesake but because
the game is so popular and the end setting itself up for this, I am sad to
report that there will more than likely be a sequal. I just hope they get
it
right the second time around.
