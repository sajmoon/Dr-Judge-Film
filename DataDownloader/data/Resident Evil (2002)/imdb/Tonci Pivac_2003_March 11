During the primary literary phase of its development as an entertainment
form, the gothic genre tended to involve a set of familiar ingredients -
ruined buildings, virtuous heroines in distress, supernatural
manifestations, heroic rescuers and loathsome villains, perhaps with a
gang
of bandits thrown in. Even though we call 'Gothic' simply 'Horror' these
days, and even though most of us now visit this genre in its new home of
the
cinema more than on the pages of books, these ingredients have hardly
changed over the years. Resident Evil is fascinating proof of this on two
levels.<br /><br />On the most obvious level, for Ruined Building read The Hive - the
abandoned
but not-so abandoned biowarfare lab which is the principal location of
this
film. For virtuous heroine read Milla Jovovich wearing a dress as short as
her legs are long; for supernatural manifestations. well, it's a zombie
film. You get the point.<br /><br />On the second level, this film is a bit of an abandoned ruin itself,
haunted
by the wailing spirit of the film it might have been. You can see how the
crumbling architecture might have formed a magnificent structure at one
time
- however, what separates this from every other romantic ruin you will
ever
visit, is simply that most ruins come to their tragic state of disrepair
thanks to the gnawing of time's teeth, or violent misuse, and not simply
because the owner got some cowboy in to build it in the first
place.<br /><br />More of a folly than a ruin, then. Sometimes this film looks beautiful -
the
cameraman certainly knows how to present the lead actress in a favourable
manner - I'm not sure Jovovich has looked quite so luminous on screen
before. A pity, then, that the film is so awful taken as a
whole.<br /><br />This is a film without sense, restraint, inspiration, or even excitement.
It's not a good zombie film, not a good action film, and not a good
science
fiction film. It has an extraordinary trompe l'oeil quality that does, at
times, deceive the viewer into thinking the film has some genuine
quality -
but it is deception only.<br /><br />What's more, it strikes me as rather bizarre that a film about zombies,
with
such obvious possible influences and precedents, should come across as
being
more interested in aping James Cameron than George Romero. Indeed, it is
somewhat pointless since it is neither the first Aliens-wannabe, nor
anything like the best-equipped to carry out such imitation; and this
supposes that imitating another (perfectly good) film is even a good idea
in
the first place.<br /><br />The utterly pointless directorial allusion to Psycho which opens the film
is
entirely typical of the direction; so, like a jackdaw's nest, this film
may
contain many shiny and interesting things but it is simply a mess. Unlike
a
jackdaw's nest it isn't constructed of old twigs or covered in guano, nor
has it fallen down a chimney into a fire yet - but we can always
hope.<br /><br />I suppose utlimately what I find most objectionable about this exercise,
and
what makes me dislike it more than many other more obviously terrible
films
is that watching it you can actually see what a good film this could have
been. This film earns contempt not so much for its mediocrity as for its
wasted potential.<br /><br />I would have LOVED to see G.A. Romero make a comeback with a &quot;Resident
Evil&quot;
movie: zombies are his territory and he would have been able to pull some
depth to it. Everything would have clicked, sure hit.<br /><br />10/10 If I could give it more I would.
