Regardless of whether or not you are a die hard Resident Evil fan, you'll
love this movie.  There truly is nothing I can say bad about this movie...it
has the perfect mix of great acting, special effects, and most importantly,
sToRyLiNe!  I saw this movie a couple of days ago and haven't stopped raving
about it since!  This will be in my DVD collection ASAP! In all fairness,
I'm not upset that some didn't like it, but I can only guess someone
wouldn't like this movie for two main reasons. 1)  If you worship the
Resident Evil game series and feel that the movie should have followed the
game more closely, and  2)  If you don't like this genre of movies entirely.
(ie: Aliens, Dawn of the Dead, Event Horizon, etc)<br /><br />I'm even amazed at how thrilled I am with this movie but I am SUPER
THRILLED!  Milla Jovovich does an awesome job as she's so versatile and
beautiful she can conform to almost any movie role.  All in all, if you like
zombie action movies and are willing to let the movie have some creative
differences from the games, then you will absolutely LOVE this movie.
Forget the title, it stands alone as one hell of an action/horror/sci-fi
film.<br /><br />Have I said enough now?  ;)
Can't wait for the sequel!  Go see Resident Evil today!!! ;)
