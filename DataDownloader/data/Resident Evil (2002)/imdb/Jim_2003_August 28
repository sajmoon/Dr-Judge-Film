This movie was disappointing by any standard. With immediately forgettable
characters (who you couldn't care less about whether or not they live or
die) laughable, garish special effects, and extremely unfrightening zombie
things as the primary terror delivery systems, &quot;Resident Evil&quot; doesn't have
enough action, scares, or anything else for that matter to satisfy anyone.
Not horror junkies, not video game fans, not even teenage boys looking for a
lowbrow 90 minute diversion.  It's even more glaringly bad when you consider
that its left itself open for a sequel... *sigh* Well as long as people keep
pouring millions and millions of dollars into crud, unoriginal movies,
Hollywood'll keep pumping them out.
