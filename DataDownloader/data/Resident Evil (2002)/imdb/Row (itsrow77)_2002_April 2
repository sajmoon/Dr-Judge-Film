A definite must see for any horror fan out there.  A futuristic update of
the horror classic &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;, but with more awesome
visual
and sound effects.  Stays true to the video game too.  I was on the edge
of
my seat throughout the whole movie.  Great ending. . .Resident Evil 2,
anyone?
