Think 1984 meets Dawn of the Dead. There is a big bad company that gets
its funding from secret experiments that involve high tech viral
research. Almost everyone has this company's regular products at home
so it is virtually unstoppable.<br /><br />The mysterious beginning the story shows someone deliberately releasing
the virus into the company's main research lab. Out heroine wakes up,
equally mysteriously, in a shower in a strange house which is attacked
by commandos whose mission it is to enter and disable the research
facility's computer.<br /><br />The story is told from an interesting point of view and the revelations
as to what happened are pretty cool. The action scenes are well done
and soundtrack is awesome. So overall this movie is a surprise since it
is both based off of a game AND conceived by Paul Anderson. This is his
best film so far. 8/10
