What can I say about this film, apart from it was terrible and I hated
it!<br /><br />I loved the games and was looking forward to seeing the film, and I was
bored throughout the film, but not throughout the WHOLE film. One or two
half decent scenes and one scene of action that will stick in anyone's
mind
(you'll know which scene I mean if you see it), but unfortunately that is
it! Most of the scenes or either too wordy and bored me, or the room is
that
full of zombie's that you can't pick out the characters! And the flashback
scenes are also far too abstract!!!<br /><br />I left the film feeling as though I had wasted 1hr 40 of my life and it
could have been better used down the pub or even standing in the rain for
1hr 40 would have pleased me more!<br /><br />I have seen the film twice (to my disgust!) and STILL I don't know
character
names, only one, and I have even looked them up on imdb.com before
watching
it for the second time! I STILL don't feel any empathy for the characters
and basically I didn't care if the made it out or not!<br /><br />I prey to God himself that the sequel is better (Resident Evil: Nemesis
[2003]) and I hope that it does the games the tiniest bit of justice,
unlike
this movie.
