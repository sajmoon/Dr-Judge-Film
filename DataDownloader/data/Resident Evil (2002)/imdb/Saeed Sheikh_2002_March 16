I was never a fan of the game Resident Evil. But seeing the movies was
indeed a very good experience. It was simply fantastic. It's like a non-stop
action going bang-bang-bang. I am converted.<br /><br />And the heroine is a sooo sexy and stylish. I am ALL SOLD on a second movie
installment, but with HER.
