I would very much prefer Romero directing this film.They isnt any gore in
this film and the zombies merely scratching their victims,no body parts
getting rip-off.The storyline for resident evil was good.There isnt any
&quot;Aliens&quot; feel to it as claimed by the director.For the sequel,how about
more
gore or at least real zombies.
