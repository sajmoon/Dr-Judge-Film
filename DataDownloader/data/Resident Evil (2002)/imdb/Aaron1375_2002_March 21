It is a good movie if you like action, gore, and horror.  This movie is
non-stop and if you like the above then you will definately not be bored.  A
trained team of commando's have to break into a facility to find out why the
computer running the place killed everyone inside.  What they find when they
turn the computer off is that the computer was trying to hold back scores of
zombies and other creepy things.  The plot isn't anything original, but the
movie is performed to perfection.  Not as good though as classic zombie
movies like Dawn of the Dead and such it still entertains.  My main
complaint is they killed the leader of the commandos to quickly he was my
favorite character (the poor guy didn't even get to be killed by zombies,
but really cool lasers).
