The film, Resident Evil seemed to be good for what it was. It's
commendable
and deserves some fair recognition, as certain scenes from the film let
the
audience settle into it's mood quite well. If the movie weren't connected
to
a series, the narrative seems to work quite well as it is. HOWEVER... I
found the movie somewhat disappointing in the sense that it DIDN'T remain
true to the Resident Evil series. When the rumors first started
circulating
about the film being released, it was originally meant to stay with the
original story in the games/books. As I saw the movie for the first time,
I
was shocked to see a totally different narrative which almost totally
contradicted the beginning of the series. I'm pretty sure that if the
film
were to have stayed true to the original story, it would have been just
as
successful. Perhaps it might have been slightly less action-filled, but
it
still would have drawn some attention. Seeming that they've totally
changed
the story, I'd like to see what the sequel will be like (if any), as I'm
positive that it definitely won't flow with the second installment of the
original series.
