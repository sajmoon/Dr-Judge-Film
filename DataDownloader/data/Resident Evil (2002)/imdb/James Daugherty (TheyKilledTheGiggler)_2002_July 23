I saw Resident Evil when it first came out in theaters but I just now got
around to reviewing it and I just have to say that while I thought the film
played out as a good action flick it failed in the zombie department. As an
action film the movie delivers lots of highly entertaining action scenes and
is not boring at all. When it comes to a zombie film however I was
dissapointed. Non of he zombies were scary and none were original. I thought
the film could've done a little better job explaining the story also.
However I still overall like the film and it's a pretty good adaption of the
game...can't wait for the sequel!!!
OVERALL 6/10
