I don't know who rocks hardest, Anderson or Rodriguez. Anderson is my
favorite director and with R.E. he shows (again) how to make a game into a
movie. With a simple story he manages to make the best game-to-movie ever,
and probably the best zombie film ever. Michelle Rodriguez is cooler then
any action-heroine around, with her cool rough style.  She also moves cool
in the movie, in one scene she reminds me of a cat. Yeah, sure, Milla is
also cool as action heroine (harder then in 5th Element) but the star of the
movie is Michelle, whitout doubt. The introduction is really cool, and the
fact that you just *know* that there are zombis lurking, before the commando
team does is also great, you just wait for them to pop out. This movie is
better then I expected, but Anderson is a genius. And Michelle
rocks.
