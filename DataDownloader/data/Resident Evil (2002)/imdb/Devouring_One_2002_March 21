Though definately not an Oscar winner, Resident Evil is an enjoyable zombie
flick. Though it mostly borrows it's material from other horror flicks, it
does have something original. A heavy metal track. In a horror movie. Heck,
if it wasn't called &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, I would have thought it was an action
movie. Of course, this sometimes causes trouble. Like how the music
sometimes totally drowns out the dialog. Then again, there isn't much
dialog. Since the characters are pretty much storyless, when one of them
dies, you can't even remember his or her name. Kinda sad...<br /><br />However, the zombies were awesome! The extras actually looked liked the
living dead, with CGI making it seem as if they were missing skin. The
zombies waddled around (like they should, by the way) more or less
aimlessly, trying to eat the people (nobody can remember their names
anywho). The Licker was something else, though! The amount of time they must
have put on it was extensive, because it moves swiftly and, in a strange
way, gracefuly.<br /><br />I guarantee you that this movie will make you jump a couple of times.
Thinking about it, I remember how every time something scaring would happen,
everyone would jump out of their seat and land with a &quot;poof&quot;. Kinda funny...<br /><br />As for RE fans, only the &quot;Hardcore Fan Boys&quot; should be disappointed. You
know, the ones that wanted an exact recreation of the first game. But
wouldn't it be lame if you already knew what would happen?<br /><br /> As a final note, go see this movie if you like zombie flicks, RE, horror
movies and movies in general. It won't disappoint.
