A fun guilty pleasure for fans of the action-horror genre.  Probably the
best movie based on a video game ever, which isn't necessarily a huge
achievement, but should still be noted.  This movie makes for an excellent
matinees or Friday night rental when one is searching for mindless
entertainment that doesn't insult your intelligence.  Not necessarily
anything new (assuming you've seen the Alien series and other zombie
classics), but still well done.
