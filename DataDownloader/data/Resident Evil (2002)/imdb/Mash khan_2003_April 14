I remember when the videogame Resident Evil came out, there was alot of
hype
and was proclaimed as the best thing ever. Did it live up to the hype?
yes
it did. Playing the game was unnerving, with some fantastic shocks.
Strange
then, that the film of the game appears some six years
later...<br /><br />Is it any good then? and how faithful an adaptation is
it?<br /><br />Well it depends on your definition of &quot;good&quot;, It's alright if your in a
veg
out I wanna watch a trashy movie sort of mood. Milla Jovovich is very
nice
eye candy, she plays an amnaesiac caught up in a battle with killer dogs,
zombies, some very nasty mutants and a murderous computer called the
Hive.
Luckily for her though, help is at hand from a special forces team headed
up
by Colin Salmon. Regardless to say they all meet quite gruesome deaths,
pretty standard fare really.<br /><br />The film itself isn't particularly faithful to the game, but I don't
think
it could be really. The game involved you exploring a mansion alone,
fighting off beasties and solving puzzles. Good idea for a game, bad idea
for a film.<br /><br />Where I think the film loses points is from the awful music, Zombies
about
to appear? Cue thrash metal crap! I found it really jarring. For me it
ruined what suspense there was. The biggest problem I had though was the
film just wasn't scary, the zombies in Michael Jackson's Thriller were
more
menacing than the zombies on display here. The dogs were quite good
though.<br /><br />If your a fan of the game, check the film out. It's entertaining in a
trashy
kinda way, there a quite alot of references to the Resident Evil games in
there and you can always just gawp at Milla.
