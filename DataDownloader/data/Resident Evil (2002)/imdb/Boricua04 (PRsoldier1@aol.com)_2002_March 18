I highly recommend you watch this movie. It is by far the best movie I have
ever seen. It has parts that'll make you jump, scream, and feel sad. I
especially liked this movie because my favorite actress, Michelle
Rodriguez,
is in it. She is a great actress and she is the one that inspired me to
want
to act because of the roles she plays. She shows how women can achieve
anything, as in her movie &quot;Girlfight.&quot; She's a great inspiration and I hope
I see her in other great movies.This is why I highly recommend you seeing
the movie &quot;Resident Evil.&quot;
