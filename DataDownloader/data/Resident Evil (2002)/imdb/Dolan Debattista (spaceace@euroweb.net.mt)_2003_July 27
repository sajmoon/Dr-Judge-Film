This one should have been &quot;The Night of the Living Dead&quot; of the new
millenium. Instead, we get a Matrix-like movie with amateurish directing,
an
incredibly irritating techno soundtrack and a mistalented cast.
Ironically,
Paul W.S. Anderson was also the director of 1995's &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; ;
perhaps
the ONLY good videogame turned movie in cinema history. The success of
this
film was due to the fact that it gave the videogame fans what they wished,
that is action and plenty of it. Unfortunately, Anderson probably forgot
that &quot;Resident Evil&quot; is a horror videogame, NOT an action one. We wanted
endless scares, suspense, a creepie environment. We deeply wished to see
the
dark atmosphere present in the game, but we get nothing of this. All we
get
is a group of soldiers spending nearly all of the movie wandering through
labarotory rooms and shooting bullets which seem never-ending.<br /><br />And speaking of the characters, why does Michelle Rodriguez think she can
act? I mean she does nothing other than spending the entire movie looking
angry and mad at the camera that she becomes incredibly annoying halfway
through. And she seems to play the same annoying character in all her
movies; just watch &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot;. It was a great pleasure
seeing how she ended up at the end, at least we can all hope she will not
be
in the sequel.<br /><br />It's a real shame that George Romero left the project of directing this
movie; I'm sure he would have done a great job. But he had his reasons of
not participating; most probably he read the awful script and was
discouraged. So why did I give this movie 2 stars? Hmmm, well probably
because Milla Jovovich is a real hottie. As a matter of fact, it's thanks
to
her that I remained to see the movie till the very end. Cause some smart
people know that if you're going to make an awful movie, at least bring in
the hottie who will make teenagers fall in love and increase the marketing
of their product. The same thing can be said to &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot;.<br /><br />(2/5 stars.)<br /><br />TRIVIA QUESTION: Try and count the number of microphones that mistakenly
pop
out at the top of the screen throughout the movie; you'll be surprised.
Another vivid proof of a half-hearted attempt to bring a popular videogame
franchise to the big screen.<br /><br />
