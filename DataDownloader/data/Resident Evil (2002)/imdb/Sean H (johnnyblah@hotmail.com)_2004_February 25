2004_February 25 

I have to admit, I was pumped at wanting to see the Resident Evil movie
upon
its release. I had been a fan of the videogames and wanted to see how they<br /><br />would translate it. It is quite evident that the filmmakers had a good
concept of the game and were familiar with it.
However I was skeptical on seeing another translation from videogame to
movie, as most have been awful. Another important thing for the game to
succesfully translate well, it would have to be R rated. If you had played
the games, you would understand why. The failures of other games into
movies
were to rate it PG or PG-13 just to get kids in the seats, good plan, but
not always the way to do it. The best example being Mortal Kombat, and its
even worse sequel. When the MK games debuted, they were extraordinarily
popular and notorius as being the most violent games ever made. So turning
it into a hammy PG-13 movie really destroyed its hopes of relying on its
history and turned off hardened fans of the games' series.<br /><br />So I was delighted Resident Evil got the R rating, but waited for home
release before giving my thoughts. I heard many comments from critics and
the average movie going people and it was mixed reviews all the time. So
what did I think?<br /><br />The movie was good for me as a fan of old Italian horror and zombie
flicks,
even though they were mostly poor films, they have a following like no
other
sub-genre in film history. I like the post-apocalyptic feel and look of
the
movie and its easy to say it was made with great style, but the substance
was lacking. This would be partially in effect of the director, writer and
editors.<br /><br />I did enjoy the way they were able to make a story, but when they ran out
of
ideas, just cramming it with zombies for 5-10 minutes of screen time til
you
get to the next point in the story is a cheap cop-out. The casting of the
movie was also interesting. Milla Jovovich as a sc-fi/action/horror hero?
Michelle Rodriguez fresh off a support role in The Fast and the Furious?
and
Eric Mabius? Obviously they weren't going for star power and having the
two
women as the leads was a peculiar choice since the games almost always had
a
strong male hero.<br /><br />Jovovich however, worked for me after the movie got going. She was easy on
the eyes as usual, but kicked some ass along the way. I liked the choice
for
her in the movie but Michelle Rodriguez's character should have died off
right away. She doesn't have the charisma or likeability to want her here,
unlike her breakout performance in Girlfight.<br /><br />Paul Anderson has made sci-fi and action before. In Event Horizon and
Soldier, both which weren't too good, but showed he had a technical
know-how
and a sense of visual flare. Same goes for this one. The action scenes are
fairly well done, and he does add a few effective scary
sequences.<br /><br />Jovovich and Mabius will be back in the inevitable sequel in the early
Spring of 2004, but director Anderson skips out and serves as producer as
he
is working on directing yet another videogame/movie crossover, the
mediocrely anticipated Aliens Vs. Predator. This time he hands the
directing
duties over to Alexander Witt, who has spent most of the past few years as
second unit director of photography on some good movies. These include
Pirates of the Carribean, xXx, The Bourne Identity, Red Dragon, Blackhawk
Down and Gladiator to name a few.<br /><br />While I hope the sequel improves on the downfalls of the original, I do
reccommend it, slightly to those who enjoy sci-fi horror, the videogame
series or zombie flicks. It isn't as gory as the works by Lucio Fulci,
Ruggero Deodato, Umberto Lenzi or George A. Romero, but when was the last
time you saw a zombie flick? Especially one from Hollywood?<br /><br />I give Resident Evil (2002) ***/4 *'s
