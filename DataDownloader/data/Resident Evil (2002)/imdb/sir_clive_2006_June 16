I don&#39;t understand all the negative emotions about this movie.
Yesterday I saw it on TV and I enjoyed it very much! Sure there are
better movies out there, but this one does deliver what it promises:
zombie action, cool heroine (Milla is unbeatable here - with Sigourney
as Ripley out of contest, of course), tension, and - from time to time
- even the relatively unexpected plot moves.<br /><br />Bear in mind, however, that this *is* a horror action movie. Don&#39;t
expect it to be logical, to have a really great story, or to be free of
errors. However, it surely is WAY better in every one of those aspects
than that overrated @#$%@ called &quot;Signs&quot;.<br /><br />I haven&#39;t seen the first 15-20 minutes of the movie, but based on the
rest, I know I&#39;ll rent myself a DVD.
