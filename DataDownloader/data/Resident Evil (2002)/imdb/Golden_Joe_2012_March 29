Seriously, I don&#x27;t see why there is too much hype about this lousy
film. I never played a Resident Evil game in my whole life, so I don&#x27;t
know how faithful it is to the source material, all that I can say is
that I found this movie to be a dumb mess (Just like all the movies
directed by Paul W.S. Anderson) being very poorly directed and boring.<br /><br />The acting is terrible, and all the characters from this film just seem
just way too plain and bland to care about them. The story it is dumb
and original as it can be, repeating several of the clich&#xE9;s used in
every previous zombie film that have been done to death (No
pun-intended) &#x22;Resident Evil&#x22; it&#x27;s a lame film, being way too overrated
and boring. I just don&#x27;t see how a movie so bad as this one could have
so many sequels and such a good reception. This is just terrible.
