I saw this movie the same day it came out. I've never played the games so I
have no reference for that.<br /><br />This movie has got to be one of the most worthless movies I have ever seen,
right up there with Solo.<br /><br />The plot is so completely predictable that I sat the entire movie through
knowing exactly what would happen next. The effects are plastic and very
industrial-looking. The movie uses every horror-movie clich&eacute; in the book.
The characters are about as one-dimensional as is ever possible, and not
only that - they're all stereotypes and clich&eacute;s of themselves. The acting
is
crap.<br /><br />In short, everything about this movie sucked. The only good thing I can say
about it is that it ended.
