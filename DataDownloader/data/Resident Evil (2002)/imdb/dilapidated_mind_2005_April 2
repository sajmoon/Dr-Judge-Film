2005_April 2 
Where to start, I am a big fan of the Resident evil series (well the
first 3 anyway) and once news reached my ears that they were making a
movie of the first game I was pretty excited. But then I actually sat
down to watch it, and to say the least was very disappointed with the
out come.<br /><br />BIG SPOILERS AHEAD <br /><br />The film begins in an underground laboratory owned by the corporation
Umbrealla inc. The lab is hidden deep within the basement of a mansion.
Some asshole releases the virus the scientists are working on which can
reanimate dead cells. The scientists get contaminated.<br /><br />Now when I saw this I thought fine its not 100% accurate but hey it
still has the potential to be a great movie.<br /><br />NO<br /><br />The computer within the lab goes psycho, sealing all the rooms off
under quarantined regulations, then it begins wiping out all the
scientists. Some woman wakes up who has lost all her memory. Deciding
the time is right to go for a walk in the cold while wearing nothing
but a highly revealing red dress she sets off on her journey, minuites
later an army team burst through the windows and join her in her quest
to do... not much. About 25 minutes further into the movie this team
comes to a large hallway. The hallway leads to the computers core where
they can shut it down. And low and behold the computer kills off 2/3 of
the cast with its lasers faster than you can say &#x22;danger Will Robbinson
danger&#x22; The survivors shut the computer down; zombies come out, and the
team being of the greatest intellect decide the best way to execute the
undead is by leg shots and shouting &#x22;Stop&#x22; a good 14 times. Team
intelligence then decide they shouldn&#x27;t have tried to switch the
computer off, and so they switch the computer back on. Near the end of
the film we are introduced to the ultimate biological weapon resembling
a single licker, no I&#x27;m not kidding, they also incorectly name it a
Hunter, where the hell is Tyrant you might ask? It&#x27;s not as if it was
an important part of the series, Tyrant virus and all. Our film draws
to a close as the &#x22;ultimate killing machine&#x22; discovers its huge
weakness it touches train tracks and promptly explodes.<br /><br />*yawn* <br /><br />The film has few plot twists which I wont spoil here. Most of the
enemies from the series don&#x27;t show up, in fact, the majority of the
film concentrates on the evil computer not the creatures. Not even
zombies.<br /><br />This movie would have been much better if it WASN&#x27;T called Resident
Evil, but something else, anything else. Really, it bears little
relation to the video games anyway besides the virus&#x27;s and
corporation&#x27;s name and I still feel this film was only called Resident
Evil so Paul Anderson could sell his hand me down script and market it
towards a wider crowd (maybe this could be attributed to Final Fantasy:
The Spirits Within as well). The point is if this movie was called Cube
3 he could still get away with it. In fact this film probably is Cube
3, just named Resident Evil to attract fans of the series to watch this
very average zombiefest.<br /><br />Oh well it can&#x27;t be as bad as Street Fighter the movie.
