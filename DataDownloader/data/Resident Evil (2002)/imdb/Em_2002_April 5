This was such a funny movie it had me in hysterics the whole way through!
the beginning, (with the evil computer thing) was quite promising, but
once
the first stumbling, grunting zombie turned up the giggles started and
they
really didn't stop. the best bit was the thing which i can only imagine to
be a mutated bunny-rabbit which was just brilliant. now i know that this
is
from a computer game so naturally there was never going to be a deep plot
or
anything and i didn't expect one. those of you who like the game go see it
and then go back home and kick some more zombie-ass because it will
definitely get you in the mood. and for those of you who (like me) don't
play the games, watch it anyway and have a laugh! i'm afraid i couldn't
take
the story seriously but it was still a very enjoyable movie with a couple
of
scary bits.
