I am all about Resident Evil; I have played and beaten every game in the
series.  Perhaps I have carry bit of a bias.  Anyhow, I took my lady friend
out to see it. I will admit that near the beginning of the film I jumped
more than she did, and she called me out on it too.  I was happy with the
start, middle and finish of the film, it rolled right along.  The plot also
contained nice little twists, which actually made for a pretty good story. 
However I was a bit disappointed with the suspense of the film.  While it
did have some moments that kept your heart beating loudly and strongly, I
just felt like it lacked the overall suspense that the games held.  Being a
big fan of Dawn of the Dead (zombie killing classic), I didn't know what to
think of the zombies in Resident Evil.  I would describe them as an army
undead tenacious Heroin attics, refusing to be taken down.  You can tell
director Paul Anderson had some influence from Romero's masterpiece Dawn of
the Dead.  There is a scene in RE that is nearly lifted right from Dawn of
the Dead (the near suicide attempt if you are familiar).  Bottom line - If
you are a fan of Resident Evil, you appreciate this movie, more importantly,
you will LOVE the ending. 8/10
