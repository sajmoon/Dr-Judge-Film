This a review done by someone who has never played the games. I saw
this movie for the first time a few days ago and I thought it was cool.
It was a good action film. Of course, I was expecting action instead of
scares so it probably appealed to me more than others. This is a movie
about a corporation that makes household products, and, secretly,
biochemical weapons or something like that. It focused on an
underground facility that was inhabited by workers of the Umbrella
Corperation. A virus that they were experimenting on escapes and
spreads amongst the workers, turning them into zombies. Then, Alice
wakes up in the shower and is soon taken by men in suits to the
underground place, hoping to shut down the computer that operates it.
Little do they know that mindless zombies among other things will soon
be hunting them down.<br /><br />This was a generally cheesy movie, but what did you expect? Most of the
corny lines were delivered by Michelle Rodriguez or however you spell
her name's character. It had an ending that I thought was somewhat
cool. It was a lot like most of the other zombie flicks I've seen. I'll
wait until the sequel is on video before I see it. Anyway, my final
rating is 6/10. (Dialogue, poor acting, and poor writing.)
