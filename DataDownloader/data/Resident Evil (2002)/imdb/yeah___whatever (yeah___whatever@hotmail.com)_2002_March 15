This is one of the better movies made from a game if not the best when it
comes to horror and action!  Despite the differences, I was not
disappointed
and think the movie is a well-done adaption.<br /><br />Resident Evil is a kick-ass, tension-filled, action-adventure experience
just like the game.  Excellent visual and special effects, plenty of
moments
full of terror, anticipation and panic that starts right from the
beginning.
Let's not forget the carnivorous zombies and vicious dogs as well as a
new
loathsome creature that will make your skin crawl.  In all that hysteria,
Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez' characters rock!<br /><br />(If you've seen Thir13en Ghosts, this is similar but better although not
as
eerie and gory.)<br /><br />This movie is just as entertaining to watch as the game is to play.  I
hope
the &quot;game&quot; doesn't end and that there will be a sequel to this
movie.
