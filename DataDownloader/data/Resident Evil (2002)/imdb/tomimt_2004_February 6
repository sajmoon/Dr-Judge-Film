As to view Resident Evil as an movie would be overstatement, because in
the end the movie is just a filmed game session. Not brilliant, but not
so terrible crap either.<br /><br />I laughed in several places where I probably should have been terrified
or scared, so i actually can't recommend this one if you are looking
for real horror, but if you can tolerate cheesy plot and bad acting and
want some laughs, this is for you then. There is just a bit too much
unintentional comedy in the film, the whole seriousness of the tone
just adds in that factor.<br /><br />Not one of the best movies of Milla Jovovich
