The first in the series of films based on the ps1 games resident evil
1-3,Resident evil is produced following the heavy demand and popularity
of the series. Alright, they made a decent attempt to create a horror
epic of human survival against the odds of zombies, but as a lot of
people who watched the film will have realised that its not the best
Zombie film created on the wide screen. There are major glitches in the
film that really spoils scenes, and besides glitches its too serious
and hard to understand. It took me 14 times watching the film to
realise what the plot actually about, and even after that it seemed a
bit confusing. Its plots a bit too confusing for a lot of people to
understand and the characters seem not to have much idea what the are
doing right from the beginning. Apart from the con side of the film,
the positive sides of the film involve good well known actors like
Millia jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez. Plus, the costumes and effects
are brilliant. The plot dose not seem to pull you in deep into the
film, but the decent horror epic and quite good action thriller part
seems to do a relatively good effort to keep you happy for an hour or
two while trying to ignore the few major glitches the film as.
