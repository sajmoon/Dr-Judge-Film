Resident Evil is exactly what it set out to be: a kick-butt action/horror
flick. You won't find anyone dying of cancer, or coming to terms with their
newfound lesbianism. What you will find is very tense, well directed and
genuinely creepy.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of sci-fi and/or horror.
