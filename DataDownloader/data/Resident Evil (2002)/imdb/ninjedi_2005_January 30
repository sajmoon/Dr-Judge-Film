Relatively fun to watch, Resident Evil, is a decent enough action film.
Hard to take seriously and lacking in atmosphere, suspense and any real
depth is does not, however, do the games justice. The games are
cinematic in quality and create an atmosphere and potential for
adaptation into a truly great film. Why the venture was given to
Anderson i will never know, adept at action, he appears to lack the
depth of creativity and understanding that is needed to develop a truly
good film. Resident Evil had the potential to be one of the scariest
films ever made and instead it has been violated and torn apart until
all that has been left of the masterful composition of the game is a
few lousy references and a distant memory of an engaging story. It is
as if someone has played the games, seen the cinematic potential, then
thrown all that out the window, focusing on creating a self-involved
'cool' film that tries to hard, yet fails more often than succeeds. The
replacement of the atmospheric music with the noise-like 'angst ridden
metal' is laughable and becoming a touch clich&eacute;d. Whilst it has its
moments, Resident Evil, does not live up to its name and frankly should
have be made by someone with more respect for the games, their
creators, their fans and film-making in general.
