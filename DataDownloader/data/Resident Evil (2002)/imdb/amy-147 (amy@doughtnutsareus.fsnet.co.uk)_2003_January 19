I was really looking forward to Resident Evil as I am both a massive fan
of
zombie movies and of the Resident Evil games. I was thinking &quot;zombies, bad
genetic shennanigans, kick ass girl heroine, if the games were great how
can
the movie go wrong??&quot; But it was so WRONG. Where to start?<br /><br />Firstly it took me and the guy I was watching it with about thirty minutes
to figure out what the hell was going. Then we realised there wasn't
actually a plot to speak of. The script, well what I could hear of it
above
the LOUD and not very good music (sounded like the directors' three year
old
kid let loose in a factory of kitchenware) was unbelievable bad to the
point
where it wasn't even funny. Alot of the talentless cast looked the same so
one minute I was thinking someone had died only to see them again (dammit)
in the next scene.<br /><br />Then there's the acting. The acting in the game's FMV sequences was like
Shakespeare compared to this. Mila Jovavich had perfected a permanently
blank expression while Michelle Rodrigez looked like she was sucking a
lemon
throughout the whole film. The CGI was so bad you could almost see the
strings and this is the only zombie film I have ever seen where the
zombies
were just NOT scary. At all.<br /><br />Every time the Red Queen popped up with her terrible English drama school
accent I  just cringed...<br /><br />God there is no way to convey the terriblness of Paul Andersons crimes. At
first I was laughing at the badness, watching Mila/Alice turn from blank
eyed bint to some superhuman action hero running up walls and killing
zombies with her thighs but eventually my laughter gave way to slack jawed
amazement at the horribleness of this film. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Rent a
Romero film instead. To think Romero could have directed this film brings
a
tear to my eye....
