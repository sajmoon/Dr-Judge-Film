This 21st century science fiction/horror story should have been much
better than it wound up. To me, it had a couple of major problems,
namely: It had very few likable characters and way overdone violence.
Regarding the latter, even with the good special-effects, nonstop
violence only serves to become boring after awhile. When are filmmakers
going to learn this? Certainly not director-writer Paul Anderson, who
was responsible for this after two previous bombs in &quot;Event Horizon&quot;
and &quot;Soldier.&quot; If you recall, those movies also were disappointing.<br /><br />The women in here are Hollywood&#39;s new type of heroine: tough-looking,
tough-talking and overly macho. Whatever happened to nice girls? If you
lived on another planet and only watched movies made on Earth, you&#39;d
think women were physically tougher than men, and all want to act like
men. Michelle Rodriguez played a character (&quot;Rain Ocampo&quot;) who
personified this misconception to the hilt. She was annoying, to say
the least, as was this film in general which is made to satisfy
millions of immature young males. Judging by the amount of reviews
here, the filmmakers succeeded.
