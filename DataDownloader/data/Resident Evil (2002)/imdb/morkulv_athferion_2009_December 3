This movie is a bit hard for me to review, because for one I am a fan
of the first Resident Evil games, and second because even though this
movie is often seen as a very mediocre movie and overall adaption of
the game, it is still much better then the second movie Resident Evil:
Apocalypse.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is poor, but its the kind of acting that is so
bad its good. Even though Milla Jovovich has the looks, she is just not
a convincing actor at all. Michelle Rodriguez&#x27;s part also doesn&#x27;t work
that well either, but I have to admit that both of them do deliver some
good action-scenes.<br /><br />The music in this movie is also something I have mixed feelings about.
Its composed in cooperation with shock-rocker Marilyn Manson. The score
sounds very industrial and cold, which adds a very eerie vibe to the
movie. But in some places the music is way too loud. I first watched
this movie in the theater and I kid you not when I say that the
industrial rock soundtrack is deafening at some parts. But I have to
say that it does fit the movie&#x27;s atmosphere well.<br /><br />The story is about your average zombie-outbreak, but instead of it
taking place on the street or in a mall its taking place in a
underground laboratory. Nothing too special, but it works.<br /><br />If you are a fan of zombie-movies then you should definitely give
Resident Evil a try, its certainly worth watching at least once. Don&#x27;t
bother watching Resident Evil: Apocalypse though because thats a whole
different story.
