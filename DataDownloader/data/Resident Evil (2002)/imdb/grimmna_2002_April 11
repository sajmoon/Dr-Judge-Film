Here is what you should know before going to see the movie..<br /><br />Two things..
One, forget its a video game movie, that is a non-factor..a mute point..
the
movie can stand on its own with or without the video game preceeding it.<br /><br />Two, remember it is a zombie movie! Don't go into it expecting clean cut
dialogue and an oscar winning cast..<br /><br />If you can remember the second you will enjoy this movie, (if you can't
accept the fact it is what it is than don't go see it to begin with).  For
a
Horror/Zombie movie I think it was very well done.  I am a huge fan of Dawn
of the Dead.. While Resident Evil is definitely not Dawn of the Dead it is
hands down the closest thing to it in years if not since.<br /><br />This is a good movie, with smooth flow and solid action sequences.  The
soundtrack/score can get a little overbearing after awhile.. but it doesn't
take from the enviroment of the movie..While the special effects aren't
stunning they are far from disappointing.. and the overall performance of
the plot/acting/characters is very solid..<br /><br />The only thing I take away negative from the viewing of this movie is the
character of Rain (Michelle Rodriguez)..I don't know if I should blame her
acting, the directors perspective, or the writing for the character in
general but it was very weak and something that could have been improved
immensely..<br /><br />Overall, if you are looking to see a solid horror flick, with its fair
share
of startles and gore you could definitely do worse.. You should also catch
it while it is in the theater.. this is a film which can take advantage of
the big screen and audio systems..<br /><br />My Ratings (3 scales) : 7 of 10  /  3 of 4  /  B+
