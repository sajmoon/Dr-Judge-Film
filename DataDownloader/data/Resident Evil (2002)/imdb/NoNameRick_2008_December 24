out of all three resident evil films, this is the only one that i gave
a perfect 10. it may not contain any of the characters from the
game(s), but it contains all the principles. the mansion, the
underground lab, and a beautifully executed boss battle.<br /><br />the good-keeps the atmosphere of the game with a slightly different
story. the bad-followed by two sequels that have a habit of changing a
few things just so they can work (for the film makers)<br /><br />summmary-if you love RE, you will enjoy this. the story is convincing,
the way the zombies are released is buyable! its a great flick for a
zombie/RE fan.
