Let's be honest: 'Resident Evil' is a great idea for a horror flick.
Unfortunately Anderson doesn't seem to have what it takes to become the John
Carpenter of today, so this movie, more or less, sucks.<br /><br />I didn't expect to see 'Citizen Kane' here, but I was hoping for some crazy
action, a lot of shooting, some creepy scenes and good rhythm.<br /><br />If you don't have script, the action should keep you captivated and on the
edge of your seat, but in 'Resident Evil' there is no action. Everything is
predictable and boring.<br /><br />The only thing that is great is the last shot of the movie. That's all. Oh
and Milla.<br /><br />2/10
