At first I was rather sceptic because other films that have been made,
based
on computer games haven't been all that great, although Angelina Jolie did
a
great job in Tomb Raider.
But when I watched Resident Evil I was really surprised and truly amazed.
The surroundings give you the chills and Milla and Michelle are just SO
cool! Everyone who likes action movies should go and see this
one.<br /><br />I already want to watch it a second time.
