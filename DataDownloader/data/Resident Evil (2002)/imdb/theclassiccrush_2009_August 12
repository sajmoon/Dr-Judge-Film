ARE YOU F*CKING RETARTED??? That movie was a waste of space, time and
money. All of the resident evil movies are sh*t. It doesn&#x27;t make the
cut as a movie let alone a as a video game based movie. It belongs on
the sci-fi channel at 3 am on a Sunday night not the big screen. This
movie just sucks even if you didn&#x27;t play the games. And if you did it
sucks more. I pray God finds pity on your soul. Jesus YOUR RETARTED.
Ugh I threw up in my mouth a little. I put a 1 out of 10 but if I could
I would have put a -10 because I don&#x27;t even want to recognize it as a
film more like a truck stops hard nasty toilet paper used to wipe the
a** of films that actually do get a 1 out of 10. Don&#x27;t get me wrong
there are good zombie films out there! just not this one. My God not
this one.
