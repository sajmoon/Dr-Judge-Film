I didn't expect much, when seeing this movie. But I was really surprised!
It's the best video-game-adaptation ever, although I didn't really know the
game! But Anderson did a wonderful job in creating a modern zombie-movie!
It
has all the suspense, that &quot;Thir13en Ghosts&quot; tried to have.<br /><br />After seeing the trailer, I expected a lot of stereotypes, &quot;stolen&quot;
scenes.... but I was wrong. And has some cool scares, too.
A must see!<br /><br />
