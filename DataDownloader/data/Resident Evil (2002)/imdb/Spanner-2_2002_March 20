This film, based on the popular video game, has a group of soldiers battling
zombies in some kind of futuristic science lab underground.. the layout of
the place was never really clear to me. However, the film is very
entertaining even as it plays up the cliches of the zombie genre.  Milla
Jovovich comes off well as an amnesiac who joins the soldiers as they fight
the zombies, and she turns out to be a formidible fighter, even though she
spends most of the film semi-naked... but hey.. works for me... The film is
an entertaining thrill ride that plays like a live action video game but if
you go in expecting that, you get what you wanted. GRADE:
B
