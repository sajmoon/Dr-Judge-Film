Zombies, mutant demon things, good basic thrills.  Kind of a ripoff of
Aliens and the 'Dead' Romero films but surely better than Alien 4 and not a
comedy like the Romero films. Succeeds where Tomb Raider failed in that it
entertains and isn't so self-consciously cool.  Audience reaction was very
positive where I saw it.
