I've seen some of the other reviews and you have people saying that this
film is full of gore,and they couldn't be more wrong, i am a fan of the
game
and of 80's horror films and with todays special effects i was expecting a
blood bath, now ask yourself whats the point of making a zombie film with
bloodless effects. This was the major problem that i had with this film. I
hope that Paul Anderson corrects his mistake and makes Resident Evil 2
knee
deep in gore. Overall the story was simple and worked with the film, the
film itself is GOOD not great. As a fan of the video game i was
disapointed,
i just hope the sequel is better. I give this film 6 out of
10
