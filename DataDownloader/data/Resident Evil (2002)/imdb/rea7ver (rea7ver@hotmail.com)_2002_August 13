I just have to say that this is one of the best movies i have ever seen.
The amazing Milla Jovovich and the beautiful Michelle Rodriguez do an
excellent job in leading this movie.  I watched the making of this like
four
times just because it is so interesting.  The RE series is awsome and I was
very happy to see that a lot of the gameplay elements (camera angles,
silent
suspense, the whole labrynth aspect) were included.  I can't wait to see
the
sequel.  Very cool, 9/10
