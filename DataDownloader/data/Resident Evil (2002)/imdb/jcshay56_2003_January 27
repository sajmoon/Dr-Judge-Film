2003_January 27 

My ratings:<br /><br />If you enjoyed the game: 8.5/10
If you didn't enjoy the game: 6/10
If you never played the game: 3/10<br /><br />I think movies about video games should be produced to mimic the video
game,
and if you enjoyed the game, then Resident Evil is a real treat to watch!
The screenplay that is the stuff of RPG video games -- i.e. flipping a
switch, and then a camera shot of some far-off room's lights coming on --
is
captured quite well in this movie.  And the camera zooms and pans that you
find when objects like trains are accelerating and slowing down...
captured
in cinematic genius as well.  The brief flashes of &quot;the licker&quot; that you
might recall from the game's beginning... also captured in the film.
Basically, if you really appreciated the kind of suspense that only video
game play brings, then you'll enjoy that part of this movie.  The
characters
are also brought to life pretty well.  I have read reviews here where
people
complain that the actors have no expressions.  Well, guess what?  The
subtleties of the expressions are exactly as you would see them in the
video
game.  Action is similar too, and zombies respond to shots the same.  If
you've ever played through Resident Evil and wondered, &quot;Hmmmm what would
these short animations look like in a full-length movie?&quot;  Well, they're
so
cool that I give this film an 8.5 if you enjoyed the game.  The director
did
a fabulous job recreating the video game!<br /><br />I was able to take a step back though and ask myself what I'd think of
this
movie if I had never played the game.  The beginning 15 minutes, as
somebody
has mentioned, is a pain to sit through.  You're left guessing a little
too
much what the hell is going on.  And the dialogue is a little unnatural
(e.g. when the &quot;Hive&quot; is described) -- but again this is all mimicking the
gameplay to a &quot;T&quot;.  The scenes are not particularly scary, and the music
is
definitely blase.  The scary parts are a little too predictable, and
there's
a wide range in which zombies get put out of commission to the point where
it seems pretty unrealistic (e.g. in one scene it takes 20 bullets to drop
a
zombie, and in another, a glass paperweight on the back of the head
suffices).  From a strictly horror film standpoint -- with special
effects,
storyline, dialogue, action, suspence, and gore in mind, this movie
doesn't
quite cut it. 3/10.
