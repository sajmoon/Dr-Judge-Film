I've never played any of the games as of yet, but if you're at all
familiar
with the games in any shape or form, you know what this is
about.<br /><br />I have just a couple gripes with 'Resident Evil.'  First, the games are
hyped up to be truly scary in parts.  In this regard, the movie clearly
doesn't follow the games at all; creepy at times?  yes, but scary?  no.
Also - there's blood and gore in this movie, but compared to what I
expected
after what I have heard from the games, I've seen more blood in a Disney
flick.  Third, there essentially is no plot.  There's enough of a story to
keep things moving along, but not very smoothly.  Finally - a certain
scene
in 'Resident Evil' was all too clearly ripped straight out of the 1997
sci-fi movie 'Cube.'  That the makers of 'Resident Evil' couldn't find
anything original and had to outright copy another film is
ludicrous.<br /><br />All in all though, despite a few flaws, this is still a highly
entertaining
action flick.  Plus, the ending is such that I actually want to see the
sequel...
