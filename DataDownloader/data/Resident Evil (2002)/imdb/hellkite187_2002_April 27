I think it's a pretty good movie over all but a pretty crap imitation of
the
game.  It would of been much better if it was just like the first game.
The
action's pretty good but i think it's more of a horror movie - makes jump
quite a bit.  I would definately recommend it if you've never played the
game, but if you have, this might be a disapointment.  The zombie's look
pretty real, but the licker thing, just looks too 3D'ish.  And also, I
don't
see why this is rated R, it's MA here in Australia, but the point is that
there's not even much gore at all!!!!<br /><br />The sequel looks like it's gonna be pretty damn good though!
