I don&#39;t know if any other movie infuriates me more than this. Well,
maybe the sequel. The people in charge in Hollywood don&#39;t seem to
realize that videogames turned to film have so much more potential than
given credit for. That&#39;s why films like this don&#39;t have a large budget,
which leads to idiots like Paul W.S. Anderson getting the chance to
direct and write... neither of which can he do.<br /><br />I mean honestly, the Resident Evil video game series does not have an
amazing story like some will say. What it does have is many characters
that will one day go down as classic heroes and villains, with a
conspiracy plot that was original and highly entertaining in how it was
uncovered. The was all set in the perfect atmosphere - a creepy mansion
filled with bloodthirsty zombies... awesome! That would be a good movie
and it is already a great series of games.<br /><br />The only thing this movie has in common with that is... yes, there are
zombies, but they&#39;re not scary. They look like sick, hungover mental
patients who can&#39;t do anything. I heard someone once say this movie was
the poor man&#39;s Aliens. Exactly. Everything about it is just so routine
and mediocre, and aside from that the best characters are killed right
away and in awful ways. (The laser hallway is among the dumbest things
ever conceived by mankind.) Furthermore, the atmosphere of the games is
lost in misplaced maniacal techno music...why?? <br /><br />I&#39;m not saying that the movie is bad just because it does not follow
the games, because the setting as a prequel is acceptable. However,
there are several other things that make a film enjoyable, and it just
doesn&#39;t work here. No good acting leads to lack of chemistry amongst
the characters. The pacing is poor, the dialogue is mundane, and it is
not scary enough for the horror flick it aspires to be. The director
was just lost. <br /><br />Rather than use a great premise, Paul Anderson abandoned it and made
something of his own, which isn&#39;t any good on its own. I&#39;ll never know
why they didn&#39;t let George Romero make it. And of course, since it was
low budget - the film made a profit and they made a sequel. That is why
this sad cycle will continue to repeat itself, and the video game movie
will forever be wasted.
