When &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; came out decades ago I kept wondering how
long it would take them to figure out to SHOOT THE ZOMBIES IN THE HEAD!!
Well, apparently our heroes are still a little slow on the uptake - or
never
saw that classic! This time the zombies, former technicians, are
underground
in a high-tech lab that secretly develops terrifying biochemical weapons
of
mass destruction.<br /><br />For those who care about the reasons for why things went crazy down there,
suffice it to say there was a plot to steal a virus to prove what a
horrible
place it is - but one of the conspirators preferred to sell the virus to
the
highest bidder, while killing everyone else (or at least turning them into
the Undead). I think that was the explanation! Regardless, a sort of SWAT
team is dispatched to shut down the Artificial Intelligence computer that
has taken control of &quot;the hive&quot; - that name for this huge multi-level
subterranean laboratory.<br /><br />The gorgeous Milla Jovovich, never looking better, plays an enigmatic
prisoner of the SWAT team suffering from memory loss. It is a really KICK
(in more ways than one) to see how she slowly regains her memory - and her
martial arts skills.<br /><br />Milla and the SWAT team descended into the menacing lab. . . and the scene
where many of them meet their grizzly, laser-induced doom (Slice and Dice
time) is a Classic Movie Moment everyone in the theater found deliciously
gory. Only after that do they (the survivors) discover the lab is filled
with refugees from &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; and a pack of bloody
zombie-Dobermans who look as though they've been turned inside-out. Milla
deals with them single-handed.<br /><br />As they make their way out, after &quot;frying&quot; the AI computer and battling
the
zombies, they discover the traitor in their midst - and a gigantic,
mutating
monstrosity with which they have a final heart-pounding battle on a moving
underground train. The thing tried some &quot;tongue-action&quot; with Milla to its
regret. Those who see it will know what I mean; it was rather
droll.<br /><br />Towards the end, Milla, wrapped in less than when she appeared in &quot;The
Fifth
Element&quot;, faces an Apocalyptic Armageddon scene - the virus not having
been
contained.<br /><br />The cast is generically adequate, although Michelle Rodriguez as &quot;Rain
Ocampo&quot; clearly modeled her tough-talking Hispanic female character on
Private Vasquez in the great &quot;Aliens&quot; from 1986.<br /><br />Special effects are very good; the monster-thing being the highlight.
Perhaps after all these movies I've become jaded, but I didn't think it
was
even all that gory. But that may be just me. There is absolutely nothing
thought-provoking about this film, which is OK with me (although that was
a
failing with &quot;The Time Machine&quot;).<br /><br />Anyway, it's a fun way to kill a few hours - entertaining and
exciting.
7 out of 10. I'm a little generous.<br /><br />Read the credit crawl at the end. Almost every name is German. It was
filmed
in Berlin.<br /><br />
