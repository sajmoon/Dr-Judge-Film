There have been a few video games that have gone into the movie industry.
Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, and Resident Evil are
three
of them. And for me, I thought Paul Anderson did an excellent job taking
Resident Evil the game to Resident Evil the movie. Although the story of
this movie is different from any video game, that's what makes it great.
Every Resident Evil video game has had a different story line to it, and
the
movie is no exception. I rated this movie a nine because for me it's
something that I can watch over and over again. Although the movie does
have
some parts that can seem unbelievable such as the zombies and the
creatures
trying to eat you, the story of how the creatures were formed with the
virus, makes it almost believable that some corporation somewhere in the
world might be doing something such as this. All in all, Resident Evil is
a
movie that you have to get caught up in to understand, and it will
definitely make you jump about every 10 minutes.
