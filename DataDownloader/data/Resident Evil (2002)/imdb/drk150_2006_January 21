This is a good zombie movie, despite not mentioning the word zombie
once. Alice is a great leading lady, despite never being called Alice
once. Turn it on, turn your brain off, and enjoy the action!<br /><br />Fans of the game complain that it's not faithful to the story lines of
the game, but you have to recognize it for what it is. It is its own
movie, not a live-action carbon copy of a video game. If you like the
game's story, play the game. The movie doesn't have to follow it
exactly to be a success.<br /><br />The CG work is looking pretty dated, but not bad. The zombie practical
make-up effects are great. Sets are good and contribute a lot to the
atmosphere of the movie. Plenty of good fight scenes, suspense, and
gross zombie behavior.<br /><br />The best scene in the movie is the end. It goes out with a bang,
leaving you wanting more and wondering if the sequel will satisfy you.<br /><br />One note: don't base your opinion of this movie on what you see on
cable. They cut out some of the best scenes, like the zombie dog fight.
Maybe animal rights people didn't like seeing a woman run up a wall and
boot a bloody dog in the face.
