Resident Evil was by far one of the best video game adapted movies,
especially considering the low budget boundaries. Unlike other zombie
horror flicks it doesn&#39;t literally &quot;throw the zombies in your face&quot;, it
makes you wait and wonder what will happen. This giving the movie a
better element of surprise in the beginning then other zombie flicks.
Overall the performances from the actors was good, but at some points
could have been better. As a fan of the game, I was very pleased to see
how it was presented. Although the ending could have been better, I
strongly recommend you seeing this if you are craving action, zombies,
and suspense all in one movie.
