I too, received free tickets to a premier showing of Resident Evil. I have
never played the original, but was an avid fan of RE II and thought it
would
be a fun movie to watch with my sci-fi loving date.<br /><br />Anyway, it was good, and the best part was what a great job they did of
depicting the &quot;Licker.&quot;  That creature scared the pee out of me in the game
and did again at the theater.  Ok, I didn't lose bladder control, but
close.<br /><br />And that spooky little girl hologram.  She can beat the Licker anyday in my
nightmares.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich has proven she can do more than walk down a catwalk.<br /><br />Can't wait for the sequel.  We'll see what they can do with the S.T.A.R.S.
uniforms.  And I'm waiting to see what kind of plant they use for the blue,
red and green herbs.
