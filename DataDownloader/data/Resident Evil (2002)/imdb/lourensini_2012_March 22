Since I was 15 i&#x27;ve heard my friends talking about this movie. It&#x27;s
impressive a guy like me, that have had watched a thousand movies still
didn&#x27;t look for Resident Evil.<br /><br />Well, RE starts trying to make us want for more. Not just the first
scene, but the whole movie. It didn&#x27;t called my attention that much at
the beginning, but te final scenes did. I wanna watch the sequence
right now.<br /><br />The best about RE is it&#x27;s soundtrack. It&#x27;s what makes this movie
convincing, entertaining, frightening and apprehensive at the same
time. Even if the soundtrack isen&#x27;t that original. It is pretty well
placed in the right moments, and it&#x27;s almost constantly throughout the
movie. This , and not the scenario is what makes it have a
cybernetic_high-tech atmosphere.<br /><br />RE&#x27;s photography could really be better, a little bit more of dark
would be welcome. And talking about photography, I also must say about
special effects and GCI computer generated imagery). In 1999, Matrix
have had presented us with amazing special effects and cgi, soon, I
truly believe monsters could be improved 3 years later, in Resident
Evil. Even if it&#x27;s not the same company working on it.<br /><br />Actors are not that great and sometimes pretty bad, script is the
easier ever written. I&#x27;ve watched on English (I&#x27;m Brazilian) and still
did understand everything they were saying, giving the simplicity of
it&#x27;s language.<br /><br />RE is and entertaining film, won&#x27;t add much at your knowledge, nothing
like cult-movies or the most intelligent ones, but you&#x27;ll like to spend
some hours watching it.<br /><br />Cheers.
