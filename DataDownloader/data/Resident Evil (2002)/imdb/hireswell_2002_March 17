The gift of the IMDB is that it gives people like me the oppurtunity to
voice his reaction to a film and now I am going to indulge on this
privilege. THIS WAS ONE OF THE WORST FILMS I HAVE EVER SEEN! First of all
the music overwhelmed the dialogue: during the action sequences the actors
lips would be moving but all you would hear would be the techno-musical
score that resembled the sound of a hammer pounding on a bag full of
electronics. Perhaps the filmakers were so embarassed of their final
product
that they tried to cover it up with the soundtrack. Another thing that I
noticed was that there were few establishing master shots, so the actors
would go from room to room and the audience would not have a clear idea of
where they were coming from or where they were going. It could be that the
producers didn't want to invest any money into a good production design so
we are stuck with tight, cookie-cutter shots of the enviroment. That takes
me to the story itself, which is nothing more than elements from other,
better movies (Alien, Dawn of the Dead and Outbreak). And worst of all,
just
when you think it's over, the movie adds on an epilogue to set up a
sequel.
All I can do is hope that this film losses enough money to convince the
producers that to make a sequel would be truly evil.
