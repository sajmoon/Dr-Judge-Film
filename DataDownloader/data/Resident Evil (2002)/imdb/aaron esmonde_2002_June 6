An amnesiac heroine (Alice) and a band of commandos attempt to contain
an outbreak at a secret underground facility where the virus has caused
the dead to come back to life.<br /><br />It&#x27;s a surprisingly great Zombie film. Past Zombie flicks have
contained a lot of bad acting with low budgets and story lines that
weren&#x27;t that great. Whle I can&#x27;t draw comparisons of the adaptation
into the film Paul Anderson does a great job of creating an empty eerie
atmosphere. <br /><br />While some of the CGI effects are an unnecessary distraction the make
up and costume design is first-rate. There&#x27;s an intelligent story and
great script. The stunts are fantastic notably the dog attack and the
supporting cast are great and the two strong female leads Milla
Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez are excellent. The music is hard
hitting, foreboding which adds to the action and creepy moments. <br /><br />A good chunk of flesh eating entertainment-a great update and revival
of zombie movies which pays homage to George A.Romero.
