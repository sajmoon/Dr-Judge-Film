I like movies with a lot of tense and shocking sound. Seeing this movie in
a
cinema or a room with high-quality of sound system is marvelous. If you
like
horror or action movies with very simple story, this might fit you.<br /><br />The story is about a company which developed some kind of virus that is
able
to 're-animate' a death body. A very typical story for zombie type of
movies. This will remind you who enjoyed the zombie movies back in the
1970-1980. On top of my enjoyment watching the heroes killed the zombies,
it
is amusing to see the beauty of Milla Jovovich and how she handled all the
zombies and led the group. The end of the story explained everything
behind
the disaster, and at the same time, it left a room for the producer to
continue the story. I bet that I will be in the cinema to watch the next
story!<br /><br />Not an original movie idea, and not a 'touching' movie, and not an
excellent
character built up, but it amused --at least for-- me.<br /><br />
