I'm not a videogame's fan, so I can't say how the movie
is near to the game.
Apart from that.. what can I say.. I really loved it!!
It's not Romero's Zombie but thinking at the latest
teen-horror movies (bleah) I would say that Resident Evil
is a come back to the '80!!! Yes! It's an horror movie
in pure eighties style with bloody heads, hands, and more.
And what about the Zombies... how many Zombies!
I really loved the end-scene too.
You gotta see it!
The eighties are coming back!!!
