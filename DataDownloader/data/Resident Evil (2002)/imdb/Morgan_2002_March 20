This movie (unlike many in this genre) totally lacks a sense of humor. And
instead of making the gore and violence comical, it is somewhat disturbing.
There are some horror films that don't have much of a sense of humor, yet
are still good (i.e. Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, ect.) but
this movie isn't that good. It is downright nerve racking at times. If you
want to see a good zombie movie, go rent any of the Evil Dead films, Dead
Alive, or any directed by George Romero.
