I loved this movie.
Now, it did not have much do with game (besides the T-Virus, Umbrella, and
music), but the new characters are done very well. I prefered them to
Chris,
Jill, Leon, and Claire. The action and visuals were fantastic, and its left
wide open for a sequel (which, according to Entertainment Weekly, is
currently being written) Overall Good: Good Acting. Milla Jonovich was a
great cast for Alice, and she delivers again. Check her out in
Zoolander(great movie!) and The 5th Element (so-so). Great Action. The
zombie raids were very entertaining, and the movie was freaky as heck, not
to mention disgusting (But the good kind of disgusting) And the licker was
sooooo cool! And you can't forget the story! While it was different from
the
game's, it was still awesome.
Overall Bad: Not enough from the games. There were only tidbits from the 3
games, and it kind of contradicts the game. But oh well. And then the
ending... You either love it or hate it. I personally loved it (Its has to
do with Resident Evil 2!!) But it leaves you with a million
questions.
But don't the critics sway you; if you've ever played the games: DO NOT
MISS
THIS!!!
