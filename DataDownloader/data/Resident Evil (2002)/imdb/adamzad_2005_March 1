to save this pile of rubbish.<br /><br />There is only *one* thing that can be said in favor of this movie:
Surprisingly, for the first time in my memory, Milla Jovovich actually
looks GOOD. In flicks like The Fifth Element, it never ceased to amaze
me the lengths she would go to to make herself look hideous. In this, I
didn't even know it was her until I saw the name in the credits here on
IMDb. Yowsa. Yummy.<br /><br />Now, about the movie... It's worthless. The &quot;plot&quot; is weak, character
development is half a step from non-existent, the premise is a rehash
of dozens of old zombie movies mixed with the crazed supercomputer
taken from dozens of other flicks, the acting is as you would expect
from low budget B-Grade horror fare, and the scenery &amp; effects are of
the level that could be achieved in my basement with odds and ends I
have lying around the house.<br /><br />This is what I will begin calling a &quot;Time-Machine Movie.&quot; Meaning I
wish I had a time machine to go back and recover the 2 hours of my life
that I wasted on this schlock. It's too late for me, but you can save
yourself from this impressive effort to lower the standards of
mediocrity even farther than they already are.
