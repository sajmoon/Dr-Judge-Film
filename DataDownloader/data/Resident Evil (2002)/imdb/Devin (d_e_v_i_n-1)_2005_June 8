Paul W.S. Anderson the director of Soldier and Mortal Kombat writes and
directs yet another game to movie, this time its Resident Evil, the hit
survival horror game.But the film is well Bad just like the sequel that
followed it; its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even
comic-book paper and really there is nothing scary in it except for
some awful acting and lame special effects. This is why this is a
forgettably film that has no lasting power and is already outdated
while some good sci-fi horror film made in the 70's arnt. A sex scene
between the 2 main female characters would have saved it- just kidding.
Nothing could have saved this film as it is a film without interest,
wit, imagination or even entertaining violence and special effects.
3/10
