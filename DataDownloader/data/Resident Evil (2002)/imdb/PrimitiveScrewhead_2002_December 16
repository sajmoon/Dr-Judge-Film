This is quite possibly the worse VideoGame Adaption I have ever seen.
Paul
Anderson has 'hacked' his way into the VideoGame market, and created a
blatant cash-in film. This is more like a rip-off of The Matrix than
anything else.
I am a HUGE fan of the videogame series. The Resident Evil videogames are
my
favorite games of all time, but this movie is really that
BAD.
The film follows the storyline of a group of 'ALIENS' type Commandos
being
sent into a Mansion of some sort, where a deadly Virus outbreak has
occured.
On the way, they meet Alice, a person who has lost her mind. And.....to
hell
with it.
This film basically has no plot, or even if it has, it has been poorly
constructed. The thing about the Resident Evil games, is that they have
strong plots which guide you in. You really get drawn into it. This film
is
incredibly bland. The acting is absolutely terrible, and cringe worthy.
It
totally lacks atmohpere which the VideoGames provide.
Let's see a small comparison between the Film and the Videogame:
FILM : Hard rock-type music. - VIDEOGAME : Eerie, quiet, orchestral
score.
FILM : Bullet Time. - VIDEOGAME : No Bullet-Time seen.
FILM : Kung Fu. - VIDEOGAME : No Bullet time.
FILM : Bland Characters. VIDEOGAME : Interesting characters.<br /><br />It clearly comes to my attention, this film bares more resemblance to The
Matrix than the Videogames. All characters are new (and very bland and
one
dimensional). We don't know them, and we never do.
It's very unbelievable how a film like this could mess up the Resident
Evil
saga. The videogames are just begging for a movie version of themselves,
and
instead, we get something that offers nothing in common with the
videogames.
It's hard to believe this film was 'based' on them. I don't even think it
is.
This film feels like 'deja vu', we've seen it all before.<br /><br />Capcom made the biggest mistake of letting Paul Anderson near the
Resident
Evil series. They also made the mistake of firing George A Romero. Sure,
Romero's script changed a few ideas, but it stuck the closest to the
videogames. Romero was the only man to do a faithful adaption. Hell, the
Resident Evil videogames are based off his ZOMBIE trilogy.<br /><br />Avoid Resident Evil The Movie at all costs.
If you want a slice of Resident Evil, stick with the VideoGames, as they
are
the true spirit of Resident Evil.
And if you want the true spirit of ZOMBIE movies, purchase George A
Romero's
Living Dead Trilogy.
And if you want Kung Fu, Bullet-Time and cool characters......you know
what
movie to watch.<br /><br />RSIDENT EVIL THE MOVIE = 0/10
