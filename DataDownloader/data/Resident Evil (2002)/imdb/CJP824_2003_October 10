As a huge Resident Evil fan, I'll admit when I first saw this film in
2002
I was fairly hard on it. But after watching it a year later I've decided
it
is a really good film. The only thing I still don't like are the zombies.
The make-up was horrific but other than that the acting was good, the
sets
were cool and the plot was not that confusing. I also like the fact that
they didn't just transfer the video game to the screen, they took a
different slant on it. I have a feeling half of the people who didn't
like
it calling it &quot;ass crap&quot; and whatnot, were just people who don't follow
the
games and just well... don't have a clue. For those who are big fans of
the
game and still didn't like it, consider the budget they were working
with.
