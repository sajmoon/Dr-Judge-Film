i had read reviews about this movie in which they said it was just a bit
better than tombraider. so i was surprised that it was in fact one of the
best movies ive ever seen(if not the best). it has lots and lots of action
and its very scary at moments, but also sometimes when people die in it
they
die in such a way that it becomes very funny. luckily it has no romantic
crap in it or any love story. it also doesnt have the happy end stuff and
such things. BEST MOVIE EVER!!
