All I have to say is that; I went into that movie expecting it too
absolutly
stink.  I left that movie absolutly blown away.  The story itself was not
exactly like the game but, it was from a different point of view.  It
still
had all that was the game and more.  In my opinion the movie lived up to
the
game in that is why the movie was so good.  (Also the dead walk paper was
CLASSIC)
