It is inspired by the same named video game, so much inspired that the
characters really have no more depth than those from the game. The true
horror in this movie is that they manage to make some video game
characters from actors, who are human being, are not they ?
Desesperatly under the level of a good living dead movie. No humor, no
surprise in an ultra-linear plot, just like a game with a start point
and a game-over screen, just a little cheap twist about memory loss
(not as good as Memento), a few scary moments OK but when i watch a
movie i want more than a Luna Park feeling. No heart, i did not feel
any emotion for any character, nothing matching Dawn of the Dead, or
Day of the Dead from Romero. A pure vacuum feeling. Some nice fx like
in Matrix, a blond haired girl who run a few steps on a wall, and what
? Avoid this void, honest people, there is not even some technical
flaws to laugh at.
