I'm somewhat surprised at the relatively high user rating for this movie. A
lot of gore  but not much else. I do hope the game that it  is based on is
better than the movie. The only redeeming feature is a lot of  scantily clad
Milla Jovovich who IS all that. However, if that's your cup of tea, I highly
recommend renting &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; instead.
