Unfortunately I saw a bad quality version of this movie.
The only thing I really found compelling was the beginnen.
large desolate -clinical views on the house with milla waking
up
memoryless.<br /><br />These few scenes brought back images from the game, eery
music
beautiful scenery and suspense all over the place, what would be behind
the
next door, or the next? a monster? a zombie? nothing?<br /><br />Unfortunately, a swat-like team comes in, a computer mainframe is there
(why??? I don't know it's as if it is put in without exploring the full
potential for a screenplay -and believe me that computer mainframe had
potential, the way it has been used ... it could have been left
out)<br /><br />The swat team could have given some tension as in &quot;the thing&quot; or as in
&quot;NothLD&quot; But they are finished of even before they can fire of a
round<br /><br />The other missed opportunity is the dead. It becomes an
&quot;aliens&quot;-meet-&quot;notld&quot; feast therefore killing all suspence and not just
the
living dead. I mean every dead person or animal is thrown at you (and the
survivors)at the same time and -the makeup effects... where's Tom Savini
when you need him,  even the blue/grey painted ones from day of the dead
were scarier,please what did they try to do, ger a PG rating?
And the final monster? When you see it attack -was it milla's
movie-husband?- it is suppose to sherd him to pieces .. you know .. some
intestins here, a leg there... maybe the head a few feet from what should
have been the rest of the body... but nooo ... just some ketchup around
the
waist ... and then the monster itself... shot as in stop-motion but
really
fuzzy as if the lenzes were out of focus...even king kong (1933) is more
convincing than that!<br /><br />of course the scene where milla kicks that doberman from hell is
brilliant
and reminiscent to the matrix, nicely shot, +1 credit for milla ...I want
to
see her do that n... anyways :-P well milla is just as beautiful as
ever...<br /><br />Of course I am going to have to view it on DVD or in the cinema ( I am
not
sure wheter it is to be released on DVD or in cinema in
holland.
Since the version I was was of bad quality, in good quality the film may
have a better (greater?) impact on me and might even change my views on
it,
when it does, I'll post another  comment to rectify this
one.
