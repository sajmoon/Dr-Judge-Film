Be-sides all the mistakes in this film (several clear 'boom mike shots',
dozens of scenes were the top of the camera is visible and I think in one
scene you can hear someone else, not the cast, talking) Resident Evil is
an
excellent film. The film captures the game, full stop and the special
effects are king. The film has that same edge to the 80's zombie flicks
('Day of the Dead' and 'Dawn of the Dead'). Creepy music an eerie feel and
plenty of 'trippy' camera views and angles. The zombies also resemble 3rd
generations from the classics and everything seems plausible. This is
definitely a film to watch.
Roll on 'Resident Evil: Nemesis'
