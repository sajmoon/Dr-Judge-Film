Resident Evil is a ride that grabs you and takes you beyond horror beyond
action.Paul Anderson is a great scifi director and I hope he stays in the
movies for a while.Resident Evil is about an elite military finds out that
the super computer has killed everyone in
the secret facility called the hive.It turns out that a virus that turns
people into flesh eating zombies.This is up there with night of the living
dead but with a scifi twist.
