WHile it probably is the best adaptation of a videogame to the big screen
ever, that really isn't saying much considering its next closest rivals
are
Final Fantasy and Mortal Kombat.... But still, I believe that those who
have
played the games and know teh backstory would truly enjoy this movie as it
captures the feel of the games PERFECTLY but without retreading parts of
teh
video game story.  The story isn't half bad, basically a virus is released
inside a bioengineering corporation and teh buildings computer kills
everyone inside to stop the contamination. A miltary team from the
corporation is sent in to disable the computer and find out what happened
to
everyone.  Along the way we find out that the virus also turns its hosts
into zombies.  So as we find teh team and some additional characters
getting
through this underground facility, they run into other genetic experiments
such as zombie dogs, and lickers.  All in all, a truly fun popcorn
flick.
