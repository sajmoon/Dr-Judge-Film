As a fan of the games I was really looking forward to this film, and now
I've seen it and I'm not disappointed at all, this film rocks!!. Set at
the
beginning of it all in Racoon city, you are eased into the shady world of
the umbrella corporation's illegal research into viral weaponry, and we
all
see the horrific results of this folly. Ok, it has to be said that horror
films are by definition, clich&eacute;d and generally formulaic, this is no
exception BUT, it has been made true to the games, In so much as none of
the
games ever compromised there 18 certificate, and never held back on the
splatter and gore and the film is no exception.<br /><br />Set in a secret underground research facility, the film starts with an act
of sabotage. The story really starts moving with the arrival of a crack
team
from the umbrella corp, who's task is to get in and find out why the
facilities main computer has gone homicidal and killed everyone inside.
Let
the fun begin.....<br /><br />This is a tense, atmospheric horror with plenty of twists and turns, some
great effects, plenty of mincing zombies, dark corridors and surprises
around every corner.<br /><br />Fans of the game will not be disappointed, horror fans won't be
disappointed, and all film fans should see this top film. Oh yes and with
a
soundtrack featuring Marilyn Manson, you know you're on a winner. Ignore
the
usual crap and SEE THIS FILM, you wont regret it!!.
