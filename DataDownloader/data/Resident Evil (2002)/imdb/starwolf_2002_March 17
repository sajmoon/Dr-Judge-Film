This is the very first time I have seen someone take a video game and do a
good job of turning it into a movie. Excellently done. The critics I see
carping about the lack of originality just don't get it. I saw one of them
say something about zombies not as good as &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; and a
train not as big as &quot;Ghosts of Mars.&quot; Doesn't he get it? The zombies were
pretty much exactly as they were the game -shambling, shuffling along until
they are close enough to attack, and then diving in for that bite! The
train, of course, was lifted pretty much exactly from the game. They
weren't
trying for a &quot;Ghosts of Mars&quot; type thing.<br /><br />Milla was amazing. I read another review that claimed &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; would
be
considered a better movie because it had a higher babe factor. Well yes,
Angelina Jolie is a babe, but guess what, so is Milla. And the story line
was a heck of a lot better than &quot;Tomb Raider.&quot; It had a point, was
internally consistent, and a great setup for the start of the
game.<br /><br />In case you're unsure of my point, I heartily approve. Great job with the
movie.
