As a *very* big fan of the games I had to see this.<br /><br />I knew it would be tripe, and it was.
The acting was dreadful, the action wasn't particularly exciting and the
zombies looked unintentionally hilarious.
In places it was boring too, with a distinct lack of chemistry between any
actors and poor 'one liners'.
They went for a serious movie and came up with a joke.
Romero's screenplay got him sacked and they came up with this
instead?<br /><br />As for the actual linkage between the games and the movie, well it was
sparse. There were definitely similarities in places, but not particularly
good ones. None of the characters from the games are here which is a huge
gamble. <br /><br />Overall, if you're a fan of the games, see this because you'll want to - but
be warned that it's terrible.<br /><br />A number of 'patrons' actually left half way through. I was tempted to do
the same but thought better of it. <br /><br />On a side note, the certification in UK gave this a 15? What does it take to
get a an 18?
