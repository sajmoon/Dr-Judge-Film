this movie was probably the best adaptation of a video game ive ever seen.
i was really scared that they were gonna cheese it up like street fighter
or
double dragon.  they really kept up with the RE story line, and the acting
wasnt half bad, either.  i liked how they laft the end open for a sequel,
too.  i kinda wanted to see a giant spider in the sewer, though...but its a
forgivable thing to leave it out.  great stuff.  im buying it when it comes
out.
