I don't know where to start. This movie is awful! The plot is crap, the
zombies are 100% cliche, the actors cannot act. The *only* nice thing in
the
whole movie is Milla. Not because of her acting, but because she's pretty
and her dress is very short....
And seeing various little mistakes (like microphones in the top of the
screen that really should NOT have been there), I can only say that the
people who made this movie were really not very interested in what they
were
doing.
Rent it, and only if you're in the mood for a B-movie.
