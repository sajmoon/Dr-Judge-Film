I was hopeful for this film, i have played all the games and although i
was
hoping for similarities i was hoping for a more unique script. Thats what
you got. An excellent tail of a race against time to save the world. Good
performances from Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez, help greatly,
relatively unknown actors pull off some good performances.<br /><br />Although not a film classic, i think this is the first Great film based on
a
game to be made. The mention of Nemesis got my spine tingling and i can't
wait for the must see sequel.<br /><br />8/10
