One would think Hollywood would have learned by now that transferring a
video game to the big screen simply does not work.  We've seen
dissapointments ranging from dull (Final Fantasy, Tomb Radier) to utterly
horrible (Mario Bros., Street Fighter).  I will concede that I found the
original Mortal Kombat somewhat entertaining.  There is, however,
absolutely
no saving grace for this sorry excuse for a movie.  The acting is bad, the
story seems thrown together, and did I mention the acting was bad?  Oh, I
almost forgot, thanks to this movie, we now have a scientific explanation
for zombies!  Come on, Hollywood!  I suppose next you'll tell us that The
Force is really just a bunch of cells inside the body.<br /><br />If you want a good laugh, try to borror it from a friend who might have
been
tricked into buying this movie.  Don't, I repeat DON'T spend the money to
rent it.  Its not THAT funny.  2 out of 10
