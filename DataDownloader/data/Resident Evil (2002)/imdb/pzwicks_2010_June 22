The resident evil series of computer games are classic cult fodder.
Terrible plots, even worse dialogue and clunky gameplay leaves you
wondering why you like it so much.<br /><br />The same goes for this film. It isn&#x27;t exactly the wisest premise to
base a film on a game that specialises in terrible plots and even worse
dialogue, but the film does just that and stays true to its source. The
plot never gets out of first gear, mainly because the writer director
don&#x27;t seem to know how to get into second gear.<br /><br />Mila Jovovich is an unusual cast as the &#x27;lead&#x27;. As a Bourne type of
lead, i.e. she has lost her memory, but knows secretly she is an
ass-kicking superstar, she ambles around the film looking mildly
perplexed in reaction to all sorts of situation. The garden seems to be
a bit windy - mildly perplexed, three of her colleagues die in front of
her - mildly perplexed. For all the while, she is for some reason clad
in a red cocktail dress, with a pair of shorts to protect her gusset,
and a pair of clunky, sexless boots. Eventually, she&#x27;ll get to fire a
gun, but only eventually - she has to find the situation less
perplexing first.<br /><br />But she doesn&#x27;t go to save the world alone. In a situation highly
influenced by Aliens, she has a team of crack troops around her with
someone playing the corporation mole. But there is not the tension of
the Aliens movie. The scares in the films are merely loud music jump
scares (some of them quite dumb to be honest), the team deaths are
signposted a mile away, and the end reveal of the mole is the wettest
of damp squibs. There are a couple of scenes as well where the zombies
seem really not dangerous at all.<br /><br />The CGI is terrible. Its hard to believe this is a 21st century film at
times. But there is a fantastic zombie dog sequence, which is so badly
executed, it has to be seen to be thoroughly enjoyed.<br /><br />So with all this negativity then, like the games, the film should rate
lowly. But, you know, like the games, its so dumb its actually really
fun. The key to the Resident Evil franchise is that it doesn&#x27;t try to
impress you, so for that reason, it can never fail. This is never going
to win any awards and Im sure anybody with half a knowledge of
horror/thrillers can name a 100 &#x27;better&#x27; films, but don&#x27;t write it off.
There is a certain charm to zombie films and this has loads of it.
