Most remarkably, a counter-gradient atones for the relatively banal plot of
ever more devastating and insurmountable enemies getting their due:
starting
out with a smashing red negligee, Milla Jovovich manages to lose apparel
with each new adversary (zombies surpassed by skinned watch-dogs surpassed
by even more terrible zombies topped by &quot;the licker&quot; who will surely
reappear as Alien V soon), till finally she is about to encounter &quot;the
nameless&quot; wrapped in little less than a measly kitchen-towel, offering her
the welcome opportunity to repeat her celebrated appearance as Leeloo in
Besson's abysmal &quot;Fifth Element&quot;: Applying the mathematics of horror to our
expectations, a genetically modified dinosaur, long dead and carnivorous
now, is the least we want to see her stalked by next, vested in but little
else than the shotgun she grabbed before she took to the deserted
streets...
