Resident Evil is a well written , well acted and well directed horror
film which holds the viewer&#x27;s attention from start to finish . <br /><br />However it is too short in my opinion and lacks a few minor details
which prevent it from being a classic .<br /><br />The film is quick to start and carries the pace well throughout . A
brief account of how the virus is spread and the fate of those affected
is given at the start . As the plot thickens and tension is mounted we
begin to realise that the &#x22;Umbrella Corp.&#x22; know no limits and are
prepared to risk anything for success in their dangerous and highly
illegal experiments . The only question is; are the team sent down to
fix things going to make matters better or worse ? <br /><br />Resident Evil is no masterpiece, but is most definitely worth a watch !
