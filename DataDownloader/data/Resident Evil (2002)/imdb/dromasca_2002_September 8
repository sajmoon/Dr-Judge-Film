I do not like zombies movies. It's a matter of taste, but none of the
after-death genres really speaks to me. I must however confess having
enjoyed 'Resident Evil', especially because it is very well made - but I
might have never seen it if I knew what it is about when I rented it from my
local Blockbuster. This would have been a miss.<br /><br />The director, Paul Anderson seems to specialize in movies inspired by
computer games (another sign of the culture of our times, but why not?).
This is his second one after 'Mortal Kombat', and it works much better. His
other sources of inspiration are Lewis Carrol's Alice, '2001 - The Space
Odissey', and of course the other zombies movies in the last 20 years. The
combination works, and I think that this is first of all because of the
clear and sure director hand. The story line is of a corporate having almost
total control of home computers ('evil' Microsoft comes in mind
immediately), and performing secret biological weapons experiments behind
the scenes. When something goes wrong, zombies are not late to show up and
start eliminating the humans around. It's not especially original, but all
is well linked, there are no major  flaws, and even the quantity of
pretentious laughable quotes is beyond the usual limit.<br /><br />Milla Jovovitch and Michelle Rodriguez are the feminine stars in the movie,
easy to remember as they are both beautiful and well-casted. The rest of the
actors team are decent. Effects are well filmed, and provide the needed
quantity of horror for the fans of the genre.<br /><br />The sequel is already in making, and I intent to go and see
it.
