I've never played any of the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; games (I'm too big of a sissy),
but one of my cousins has and she assures me that this movie follows the
game's plotline to a T.  That's the good news.<br /><br />The bad news is that I was expecting a movie that'd scare the
goodness-knows-what out of me and it didn't.  Now, it does LOOK cool and
atmospheric, but it isn't wickedly gruesome like the George Romero &quot;Dead&quot;
series or delightfully sick like the &quot;Evil Dead&quot; series.  For a zombie
movie, this is pretty boring.
