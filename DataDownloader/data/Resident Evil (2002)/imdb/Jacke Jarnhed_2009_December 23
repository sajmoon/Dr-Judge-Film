So... The Resident Evil movie is located in a place called The Hive. A
lethal virus has been released and spread throughout The Hive via the
ventilation system, everything stops at The Hive all communication to
the outside world is lost. So now, an elite military unit is sent to
find out what the h*ck happened there, this elite team stumbles upon
Alice, guarding the entrance to The Hive but is totally unknowing of
what is going on, after suffering the after-effects of the nerve-gas
released in the big mansion in which she is located. Alice is a very
skilled fighter without knowing it and will play a big roll in the
mission the team has been sent to complete.<br /><br />While in the Hive the team&#x27;s mission is to shut down the computer
controlling the place, but while doing so they awake and release the
staff that has been working there, so now they have to fight their way
out of The Hive which is now guarded by hundreds of hungry zombies,
other experiments conducted down here and at last the computer herself,
The Red Queen which they must awake in order to get out.<br /><br />So that was the story. The story is quite original, and interesting
enough to get you wanting to find out what was really going on down
here, and the movie will keep you that way all the way through, you
also start to care about the characters, hoping they will all get out
safely, because they are so brilliantly played, mostly by Milla
Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez (Which is an extremely talented actor in
my opinion.), Eric Mabius, Martin Crewes and James Purefoy, of course
there are more, but those are the main, main characters, if you insist
there is also Colin Salmon, Anna Bolt and Michaela Dicker. All of these
things contribute to a great and a little scary action/thriller movie.<br /><br />******** Conclusion ********<br /><br />I love this movie for it&#x27;s original story and plot, great acting and so
on. As i said: All of these things contribute to a great and a little
scary action/thriller movie, no matter what movies you like, you&#x27;re
gonna love this, it is an amazing, pretty scary masterpiece, and i hope
the fourth movie doesn&#x27;t ruin the whole series. A 10/10 from me, it
can&#x27;t get much better than this!<br /><br />I am Jacke9779 and i hope you liked my review of Resident Evil, thanks
for reading and until next time, have a great life.
