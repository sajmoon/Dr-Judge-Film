HOLY SHNIKIES!<br /><br />Not a &quot;gamer&quot;, never saw the game either. But this flick ROCKS! Some folks
here with NO TASTE have said Paul Anderson's Event Horizon &amp; Soldier
STINK....but yet still like this film...well, glad they liked it, but they
dont have a clue about what good sci-fi IS...oh they will will ALWAYS say,
&quot;BLADE RUNNER&quot; &amp; &quot;ALIEN&quot;...which are good flicks....but get the HELL out of
the past people! You're NEVER gonna enjoy a sci fi flick if you keep
comparing it to the same 2 movies ALL THE TIME! Jeesh...get over it
already.<br /><br />THAT said, Its about TIME a Zombie flick has come along, that with the
exception of &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;, has finally flushed the bad tatse
out of my mouth that was left there with Romero's INSIPIDLY LOUD, BADLY
ACTED, BADLY SFX'd and MAKEUP'd Zombie remakes.... DOWN with DAWN and DAY
OF
THE DEAD...LONG LIVE RESIDENT EVIL &amp; its SEQUELS!!!
