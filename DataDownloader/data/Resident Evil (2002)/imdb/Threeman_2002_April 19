Rubbish action.  Rubbish horror.  I was going to limit my review of RESIDENT
EVIL to these two pithy phrases.  But when the comment `Well, what were you
expecting anyway?' floated in my general direction, I began to bristle at
this lazy, time-worn mantra.  <br /><br />So what was I expecting, indeed hoping, to get out of this?   More.  Much
more.  We simply must learn to be more demanding.  I speak as a fan of the
original video games, and as a lover of a good Zombie-fest.  Yes, I love
zombies &#150; adore the pasty-faced, shambling hordes of Romero's DAWN OF THE
DEAD, the eerie moth-eaten Templar Knights from the BLIND DEAD series, even
Fulci's faintly charming, crumbling undead.  And here's the thing &#150; the
zombies in RESIDENT EVIL are just about the most uninspiringly sanitised
bunch you could ever (not) hope to bump into.  They are a distillation of
all the film's failings.<br /><br />Early impressions are favourable, with slick visuals and meaty, evocative
sound design.  But glossy aesthetics have the capacity to irritate rapidly
in the absence of any semblance of plot.  Make no mistake, the screenplay is
RESIDENT EVIL'S principal Achilles' heel.  The lousy dialogue (the one
element to have survived intact in the transition from game to film) is
further undermined by a limp narrative consisting entirely of one poorly
conceived and executed set-piece after another.  Characters spend the vast
majority of the time running from point A to point B, without thought or
ingenuity, to the extent that the viewer is soon faced with a tiresomely
uninteresting series of disconnected and repetitive episodes.  Things aren't
helped along by some very strange continuity decisions, with characters
regularly in calm conversation one moment and the next hysterically slamming
doors shut in the face of a mutant horde.  <br /><br />As though to paper over the glaring cracks, a bombastic electronic / heavy
guitar score kicks in every few seconds, often at the most inopportune
moments.  Suspense and fear arise as much from moments of silence as from
noise, but the first, most obvious lesson of horror filmmaking is so
obviously and sadly lost on Paul Anderson and co.  The undisciplined noise
put me very much in mind of TOMB RAIDER, which similarly failed to capture
the spirit of the original video games despite superficial similarities in
the set design.   These video games are primarily solitary experiences, I
would venture almost introspective, whereas the celluloid incarnations are
anything but, raucous and over-populated.  I can just imagine a major studio
risking a high-profile franchise with an introspective film light on
dialogue and supporting characters, but rich in atmosphere.... not.<br /><br />I've seen the word `splatter' bandied about with reckless ease on these
pages.  Please don't make me laugh.  The gallery of monsters on offer,
including the aforementioned zombies, singularly fail to impress, victims of
an overly clean, fussy cinematography that imparts a sanitised sheen on
everything.  The blood-letting is unimpressive and deceptively clinical. 
Rather like persisting with a dull film in the hope of catching the odd
crumb of gratuitous nudity, here I was soon hankering after some proper,
sleazy gore to alleviate the tedium.  At this point, you know in your heart
of hearts that both you and the film are in dire trouble, nay sinking fast. <br /><br />RESIDENT EVIL fails as horror and as action.  It's a one-trick pony that is
relentlessly noisy and tedious.
