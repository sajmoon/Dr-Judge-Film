This movie is awesome! I've played the games, so i like it a lot
more
then some others might, but this movie is a non-stop action thriller.
Zombies jumping out at you. Monsters crawling in the dark. a virus on the
loose! It doesnt get much better then that! milla jovavich is so cool in
this movie. as well as all of the co-stars. there is a lot of character
development, some twists and back stabbings in the plot. it's what the
previews all say &quot;100 minutes of non-stop terror!&quot;
I recommend this to anyone who saw THE FIFTH ELEMENT, SHERE, or new
films like BLADE 2 and QUEEN OF THE DAMNED. u all gotta' see this movie. i
was on the edge of my seat the whole time!!
