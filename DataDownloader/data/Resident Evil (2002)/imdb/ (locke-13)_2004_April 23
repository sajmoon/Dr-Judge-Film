It's hard to know where to start.  Perhaps the writer/director, Paul W.S.
Anderson, intends some sort of irony, when he serves up this mindless,
soulless corpse of a film.  But really, I don't think he's that complex.
Drivel of this kind puts even bombs such as 'Tomb Raider' in a good
light.<br /><br />The premise involves something along the lines of: &quot;corporation happily
conducting research into viruses, when it all goes terribly wrong, and
there's some zombies and some screaming and .. er, some
zombies.&quot;
The plot then takes this premise and promptly sits down. I mean it.  It
goes
absolutely nowhere.  It's as if the director just wants to string together
meaningless, unrelated scenarios from generic computer games.  Characters
are suddenly alone, without explanation.  Between scenes, the lead
alternates from scared bystander to superhuman commando.  If by this
point,
you're thinking &quot;The only thing that kept this reviewer watching this film
to the end was so that he can moan about it afterwards&quot;, you'd be utterly
correct.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich provides the gratuitous nudity that the director obviously
feels belongs in a film like this.  He gets it out of the way at the start
of the film, almost as if he's catering for all the viewers who will walk
out during the film.  It may seem unfair to dismiss Jovovich like this,
but
it isn't as if she does any acting in this film.  To be fair, she has
absolutely no material to work with, and the director's idea of character
development seems to be the progression from &quot;wearing a jacket&quot; to &quot;not
wearing a jacket&quot;.<br /><br />Michelle Rodriguez garnered critical acclaim for her work in 'Girlfight',
but sleepwalks through her role here.  The forgettable male cast repeat
tired lines like clockwork; including the immortal &quot;We're not getting out
of
here. We're all going to die.&quot;
The great Hollywood idea behind making movies based on computer games
seems
to be 'Neither acting nor development is important, just do some action
scenes, and the unwashed masses will be happy.'  Here, even the action
scenes disappoint.  Kicks and punches are unconvincing, the gunfights
mind-numbingly boring.<br /><br />The tension and gore that are supposed to sell a film in this genre are at
least attempted.  The basic problem with tension is that we feel no
empathy
for the characters, and don't particularly care if they live or die.  The
problem with the gore is, like everything else in the film, it is
presented
in an entirely meaningless way.  The film doesn't even set up the basic
threat properly; if the zombies are so hungry, why don't they feed on each
other?
That is the only plothole that I will mention, because if you are ever
unfortunate enough to be made to watch this film, perhaps playing
'spot-the-plotholes' might provide you with your entertainment for the
evening.<br /><br />Oh, and at the climax, the director unleashes some of the worst 'special'
effects I have ever seen in my life.  I nearly cried out in horror at how
poorly done it was.  Oh, perhaps the director is employing his special
'irony' again. Silly me.<br /><br />2.0 / 10
