Sorry, bad pun. Just to warn you, I am a huhe RE fanboy. I think that the
movie could have been better, but I think it was still pretty damn good. I
did watch it 4 times in the theaters. I wish that it would have followed
the
games a bit closer. It would have been more interesting. Still, I think
that
it was a rather solid movie. I love watching it and pointing out all of
the
stuff from the games, you know, at least until Resident Evil Online or
Resident Evil Nemesis come out.
