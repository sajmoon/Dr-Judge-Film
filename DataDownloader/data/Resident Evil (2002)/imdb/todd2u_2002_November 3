2002_November 3 

First I want to say is that I'm not this serious movie critic. I am just a
lover of movies. I just do this for fun. I've done a review on this movie
before but I want to do another one, cause the first one didn't do any
justice. Second I just want to say that I love video game movies like Mortal
Kombat, Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy, Street Fighter. And like those movies it
entertained me big time. This movie has lots of action, really creepy
zombies, and weird but cool music. I honestly don't care about little flaws
in movie, unless their really big that everyone can notice. I liked Mr.
Anderson's direction in this movie. I liked the acting from Milla Jovovich,
Michelle Rodriguez, and the rest of the cast. Yes, the C.G. monster at the
end was fake looking, but thats the only thing I didn't like about the
movie. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a god action, horror
movie.
