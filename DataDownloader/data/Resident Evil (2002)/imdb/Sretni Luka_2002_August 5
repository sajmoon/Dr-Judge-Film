Ok, the story is stupid, but that's what is to be expected of a game
adaptation. Once you get that behind it's just great - relaxing and
intense
at the same time.
Milla acts great, that nice little &quot;I don't know what's going on&quot; look on
her face. And even better when she remembers how to &quot;kick ass&quot;!<br /><br />The other actors are average, but i guess that's not what I'm looking for
in
a action/horror/Sci-Fi movie.<br /><br />All in all, the movie is great and the dogs rock. Looking forward to
Nemesis.
