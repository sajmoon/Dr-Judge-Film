I went to go see the movie the same day that it came out, and today I'm
going to go see the second part as well. I found the movie to be
completely awesome!!!!!! No, it did not have many similarities to the
game, but I think that is what made it great! The setting was the same,
but if you wanted to see a replication of the game, then replay the
game. That's my opinion. I believe that adding different characters was
a very good idea. The best part is that they added the dogs and the
licker. I can't wait to see part two now!!!! Resident Evil was really
matched with the game. Though Chris and the other Star members were not
in there, they couldn't have made a better movie.
