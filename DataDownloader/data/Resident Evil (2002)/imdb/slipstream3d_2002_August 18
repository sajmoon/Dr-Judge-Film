This movie has simply the best sound I have ever heard in a movie. You
must
see it using at least a 5 speaker Dolby Digital system. That said, I also
enjoyed the incredible mood and ambience the sets and lighting created.
Although the plot is a bit lacking and somewhat rushed, it doesn't matter-
that's not what Resident Evil is about.<br /><br />*minor spolier*<br /><br />The biggest drawback is the computer generated 'big bad guy'. Although the
bad CG doesn't ruin the movie, they are a jarring reminder that the movie
isn't real- the other special effects, however, are amazing, and could
easily draw you in to the world of Resident Evil.<br /><br />7/10 stars.
