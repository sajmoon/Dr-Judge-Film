Resident Evil, or more appropriately, Biohazard, is a ground breaking
movie
based on a video game series.  The production values of Resident Evil are
clearly superior to all others in its class.  The movie follows an
original
storyline with elements of the games interspersed.  The result is an
explosive, fast-paced, action film that delivers the best of the games
into
one feature.  However, if you see this film, you shall see for yourself
the
following of its video game franchise name and originator, Resident Evil.
See it...
