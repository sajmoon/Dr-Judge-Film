I saw RE last night and it felt like I was watching a movie that was
destined to be a new cult classic. The setting of the abandoned mansion and
hive in the beginning was very spooky, with a good amount of the usual
&quot;person sneaking up behind me&quot; startles. The movie kept a great on the edge
of your seat feel through the whole thing, and all of the gamers out there
are sure to love the game tie ins as I did. As far as casting Mila Jovovich
and Michelle Rodriguez were cast perfectly in their roles. A very enjoyable
horror movie with it's only flaws being the poor CGI work on the mutating
monsters, but I felt the skinless guard dogs made up for most of the bad
CGI
work.
