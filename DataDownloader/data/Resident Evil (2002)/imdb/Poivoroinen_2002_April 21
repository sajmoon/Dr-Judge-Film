As ALL other game to movie this is a disappointment. Of course this is in
the genre game to movie the best of it's genre.<br /><br />Complicated story (LOT'S of explaning) a lot of mele&eacute; actor's, and the
zombies really stinks!<br /><br />That's the main problem with the film! It's already rated R, so why
couldn't
Andersson have brought out the gore more? That is one of the game's best
bet, gore, thrill, horror simply. It's supposed to be a horrormovie, yet
it's quite BORING! George A. Romero has done far better with Night of the
Living Dead, and that was a black and white movie. The zombies in Resident
Evil aint scary, they don't look dead.<br /><br />5/10. Oh, and Milla Jovovich is kinda flat in the movie, not at all the
whamming experience that many imdbvoter's think she is.
