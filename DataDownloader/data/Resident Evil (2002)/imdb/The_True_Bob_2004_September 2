Resident Evil, despite its reputation, was never a particularly great
video game. The story was weak, the writing and voice acting atrocious,
and the many puzzles contrived and pointless. But at least you could
blow a zombie's head off with a shotgun.<br /><br />Resident Evil, the movie, directed by Paul &quot;Stop giving me money&quot;
Anderson, is a particularly awful film. The story is &quot;original&quot; in that
it deviates from the video games, but where it deviates is even worse.
The writing is nonexistent, and the acting, at best, is unimpressive.
It may also be the first film to not only provide a digital map to show
the audience where the characters are, yet still make it impossible to
tell where the hell anyone is. And, to make matters worse, it, for the
most part, lacks the shotgun-to-head satisfaction value that made
Resident Evil a hit in the world of video games.<br /><br />Case in point:<br /><br />Parts of the film could have been suspenseful. COULD HAVE. But even
that is lost when the awful soundtrack kicks into gear, drowning out
any atmosphere the film might have had. <br /><br />To make matters worse (if they could be), the film includes very little
gore, aside from a cheesy laser-slicing scene that was better off left
on the drawing board. And the zombies, if you could call them that, are
about as menacing as the cheese between my toes.<br /><br />On the plus side, I kind of like the ending, which is the only part
where the film, in some remote way, works. <br /><br />* out of *****
