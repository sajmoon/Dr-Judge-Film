Im a big Resident Evil fan and when i first heard about the plot, i had
low
expectations, but as time when on, i was sure it would be a great
movie<br /><br />I went into the theatre with great expectations and i wasnt disappointed
at
all, it doesnt follow the game at all, but in a way it does, and it does
it
very well.<br /><br />I am very proud of what Anderson has done and i hope this is his big break
into making more movies.
