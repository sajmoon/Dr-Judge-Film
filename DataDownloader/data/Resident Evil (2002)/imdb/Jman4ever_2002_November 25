I have heard all the bad comments about Resident Evil: The Movie that I can
stand.  I say that this movie was well casted and well directed.  I was
scared from the beginning.  The part I didn't like was the whole synophsis
that they didn't have Jill Valentine or anyone like that that it was NEW
Characters but the movie was still pretty good.  It wasn't the best
constructed (as in storyline)movie that I have seen but other then that I do
like Milla Jovovich and her ass kicking skills in The Fifth Element as well
as in RE: The Movie.  <br /><br />I rate this movie 2/5.
