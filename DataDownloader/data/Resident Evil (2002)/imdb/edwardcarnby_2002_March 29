Just watched it today at my local cinema, and was totally blown away by
everything. Terrific action, suspense, blood and guts, cool special
effects,
all the right combination that made the game of the same name so popular.
A
salute to the director.<br /><br />Although I was a bit disappointed that Jill Valentine and all the familiar
characters from the videogame wasn't there. Maybe the reason why, I guess,
was to avoid the plot predictability like 'oh she's gonna die soon' and
'oh,
that one will live' and the likes. But as a fan of the game series also, I
was glad that there are some references like the T-Virus, zombie dogs,
walking dead, the deadly licker, underground base, labs, the transport
train. There is one scene when the protagonist was escaping the facility
which would ring some deja-vu to those who played the game.<br /><br />On to the cast, Milla Jovovich who somehow adds some femme fatale to her
role - as she did likewise in the Fifth Element, Michelle Rodriguez (Fast
and the Furious) reprises her tough girl role. Kudos to all those who
played
the commandos and zombies, and also the childlike Red Queen.<br /><br />All in all, i am just waiting here for the next sequel.
