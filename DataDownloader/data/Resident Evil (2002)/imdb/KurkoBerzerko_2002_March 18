This movie rocks!  It is not one of those dum slasher flicks.  Its got a
great and twisted plot.  The special effects are amazing.  It is a real
&quot;jumpy&quot; movie-I was on the edge of my seat the whole time wondering if
that
person was &quot;going to get it.&quot;  And last but not least, it freaked me
out!
