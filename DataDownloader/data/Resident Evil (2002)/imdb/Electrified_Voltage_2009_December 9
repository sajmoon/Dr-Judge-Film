This movie is another cheesy video game adaptation, and is based on a
game series which I&#x27;m not familiar with. The film was released years
before it ever caught my attention and it obviously wasn&#x27;t any of the
&#x22;Resident Evil&#x22; games that lead me to watch it, since I&#x27;ve never played
any of them. I first found out about this Paul W.S. Anderson movie when
I learned that Milla Jovovich was in it. Before I rented it the other
day, I knew it was one of the polarizing modern action blockbusters,
but fortunately not one of the universally panned ones. Due to all the
criticism, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a great film, but thought it could be
pretty good at best. I can now understand the widespread criticism, but
despite the severe flaws, I found some redeeming qualities.<br /><br />Below Raccoon City, there is a top secret underground genetic research
facility called the Hive, owned by the extremely powerful Umbrella
Corporation. After a vial is broken, releasing a virus, the lab&#x27;s
supercomputer known as the Red Queen locks the Hive to prevent the
virus from escaping, trapping and killing all the employees inside! A
military unit then takes Alice and Spence, two people suffering from
amnesia, and goes to the Hive to investigate what has happened. The
head of the commandos, known as the &#x22;One&#x22;, explains why they are all
here, and several members of the team attempt to disable the Red Queen,
but are cut up by a laser! This leaves Alice, Spence, Rain Ocampo, Matt
Addison, and Chad Kaplan to continue the mission. They discover that
the supercomputer is not the only problem, as the employees who were
killed have mutated into flesh-eating zombies, and can now be found all
over the facility! <br /><br />From the beginning, I could tell the film wasn&#x27;t that great, but when
the emergency in the &#x22;Hive&#x22; begins, so does the suspense! After that
sequence, Milla Jovovich, who plays Alice, makes her first appearance
in the film naked, waking up in the mansion shower, and this scene
could easily be cited as a highlight for straight male viewers like me.
The suspense continues as Alice looks around in the mansion, but
unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t stay consistent. The sci-fi action horror
film can be a little hard to follow at times, the music is sometimes
really cheesy, and there are some extremely juvenile lines. In addition
to that, the characters are underdeveloped, and at least some of them
seem like naive high school students who shouldn&#x27;t be on a mission like
this. The acting is nothing special, and Michelle Rodriguez&#x27;
performance as Rain Ocampo is particularly poor. However, while the
walk through the Hive before the mutants are found is pretty dull,
there&#x27;s a lot more adrenaline as the film goes along and the group
faces the dangers of this underground facility. Jovovich and her
fighting moves were another highlight for me. Also, as usual for these
modern action sci-fi blockbusters, there are great sets and special
effects in this film.<br /><br />I&#x27;m not sure if this video game adaptation deserves the 7/10 rating I&#x27;m
giving it. Overall, it is cheesy and juvenile, and probably mainly
appeals to young male viewers (younger than me). I realize Paul W.S.
Anderson was also the one who directed 1995&#x27;s &#x22;Mortal Kombat&#x22; (another
movie based on a video game), and I didn&#x27;t like that film at all, but
for some reason, that wasn&#x27;t quite the case with this 2002 blockbuster.
I&#x27;m not sure what I would think of it with a second viewing, but it
wasn&#x27;t bad for one viewing, as much as I think some of the haters have
made some good points! If you hate mindless action, you will hate this
movie, so don&#x27;t watch it, and if you like that sort of thing, well, you
MIGHT like this first &#x22;Resident Evil&#x22; movie, but there&#x27;s no guarantee.
The flaws could still be too much for you to take, and you could end up
wondering how anyone could possibly like the movie!
