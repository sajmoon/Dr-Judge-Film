This is one of the few Game based movies that accually has a story of its
own!
Oh well.. the resident evil game feeling is there..but it goes
deeper.
aIf you played the game you know there is a fantastic and complexed story
behind all the evil, what starts as any regular &quot;EVIL ZOMBIE MOVIE&quot; ends
fantastic..the story in short;
A team of elite commandos is sent into an underground laboratory to find
out
what caused the death of several thousand employees. Of course, an evil
corporation has been evilly getting up to evil tricks and nasty things are
lurking in dark corners.
Oh well... YOU HAVE TO SEE IT!
