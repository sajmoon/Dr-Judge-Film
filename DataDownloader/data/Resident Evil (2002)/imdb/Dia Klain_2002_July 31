2002_July 31 

I cannot believe as many people liked it as is. This movie was ... beyond
believe bad. Perhaps it is my total dislike for zombie movies ... perhaps it
was not, but... STOP MAKING BAD MOVIES HOLLYWOOD! thinks that were
wrong
1) the action took place in totally uninteresting places.. At least make it
pretty!!! old mansion. HALLO!
2)um. plot? is it there.. um. ok by the end it lurks around the corner. try
having it in sooner
3) what the HELL is going on (my only thought the first hour 45
min)
4)ok so the filming was done well but what are they filming...(remember to
get make up tips from 13 Ghosts next time)
5) the ending was quite cool except for the fact that it's only there to
provide a bridge for the next Resident Evil movie which... what do you
know!... is coming out in 2003 no less!
