Resident Evil was about as good as could be expected from a video game
genre.  The idea of having a Resident Evil movie was really exciting to me
as a lover of Resident Evil 2's action and horror elements.  The movie
adapted these elements fairly well with movie style and the video game's
idea.  However, there was something about it that left you wanting maybe a
little MORE of the video game's magic.  Maybe more blood.  Maybe more
surprises.  I personally think the 2nd one will be much better.  That is if
it picks up where the first left off.  Because I loved walking through that
alley and being freaked out by the things that would pop up.  Most of them
were zombies but some of them were dogs and assorted evils.  But anyway,
you
get the idea.  It was Resident Evil alright, but like Diet Resident Evil.
Or Resident Evil Light.  It wasn't as filling as the game, plain and
simply.
