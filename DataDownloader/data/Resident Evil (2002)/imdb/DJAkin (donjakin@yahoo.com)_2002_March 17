Wow, this film was bad.  I mean, the best part was watching Milla Jovovich!!
 She looked good and hid her accent well.  This performance on her part was
fine and she shows good moves (way better than that pile of dribble called
TOMB RAIDER).  The movie starts off ok with a cool shot of where the
scientists work in &quot;the hive&quot;.  Then something goes wrong and the computer
locks down the lab and kills everybody.  Then, a SWAT team shows up lead by
some man who looks like the CANDYMAN.  There's a scene where some laser
beams slice some of that team.  That was a rip off from the Cell.  Then
suddenly all these makeshift Zombies show up after five hours of being dead!
 It was Alien's meets Return of the Living Dead (especially since The
Candyman is in it) with a little bit of OUTBREAK thrown in.  What you get
when you mix those three together is a movie that appeals to only little
kids with candy.  In fact, I was embarassed because I was the only adult in
the movie theater!  I wanted to see that hispanic girl DIE the entire time. 
I also wanted for Milla Jovovich to have more speaking parts.  Milla
Jovovich is one of the best actresses of our generation.  I hope that Milla
Jovovich learns that she can do more than just these sell out movies.  Ugg. 
And what's the deal with that stupid Red Queen?  As if any artificial
intelligence (another stupid movie) could be all nice and then start
screaming &quot;KILL HER!  KILL HER NOW!&quot;  Many things were wrong with this
movie.  Shame on you Milla Jovovich.  I will give you another chance though
because you're the best looking actress since Andie McDowll.  I rate this
movie a 2.
