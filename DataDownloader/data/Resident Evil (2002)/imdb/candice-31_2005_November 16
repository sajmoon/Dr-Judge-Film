Firstly let me say that I have not played the game R Evil. However I do
know the story after countless hours watching my boyfriend play. As I
am not a great fan of zombie movies I didn't expect to get much from
this film. However to my surprise I really liked it.<br /><br />Yes the zombies still walk round at a snails pace and have the brain of
goldfish, but the fact that crew are confined underground means that
they simply can't just run away. Which is what I have always thought
when I have watched other zombie films. To add to this you have the
whole world off genetic engineering thrown in. So instead of just blood
thirsty zombie's you also have the added bonus of some very nasty man
made creature's.<br /><br />Therefore overall I would say that providing you are not expecting a
carbon copy of the computer game, Resident Evil is an good choice if
you enjoy the thrill of the creepy horror movie.
