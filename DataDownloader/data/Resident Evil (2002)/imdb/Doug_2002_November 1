Resident Evil was an exciting, and fun film. Of course Milla stole the
show.
But Michelle Rodriguez, and Eric Mabius also gave quality performances.
The
special effects were well done, and the plot was substantial. For a
game-based film Resident Evil was quite polished, and I recommend it to
any
sci-fi/action/horror fans. I look forward to the sequel, Resident Evil:
Nemesis.
