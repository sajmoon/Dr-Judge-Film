this film is everything i was hoping for in an game adaption, the
character
are true to life and the plot and elements complements very nice to the
game
series. some parts are predictable (music cues-gotta love 'em! :) ) yet it
got me startled on more than one occasion. definatly a must see for horror
fans, hardcore RE fans, and everyone else in between. btw, marilyn manson
did a great job on the score.
