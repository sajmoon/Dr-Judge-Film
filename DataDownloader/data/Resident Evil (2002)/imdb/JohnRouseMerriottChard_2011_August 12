A virus has turned the workers at an Umbrella Corporation HQ in to the
snarling undead. Enter a crack team of commandos to lay waste wherever
possible. But with a super-computer running the show and mistrust and
amnesia gripping the surviving humans, it&#x27;s a mission fraught with
peril at every turn. <br /><br />How many good game adaptations to screen can you name? Of course the
answer to this will depend on your age, love of the genre-sub-genre,
games and how easily pleased you are. That Resident Evil has to date
spawned four sequels, suggests that there&#x27;s a target audience lapping
it up. Why? I have no idea, going on this first film it&#x27;s a wonder all
those involved wasn&#x27;t locked away in some Hive facility of their own to
never be let out ever again.<br /><br />Though marginally better than the quite awful Tomb Raider adaptation,
Resident Evil lacks atmosphere, shocks and a distinct lack of brain
usage for the puzzles in the plot. Add in that it&#x27;s totally
predictable, the characters are dumb and that the creatures are like
something Nick Park would make to scare his children, well it&#x27;s not got
much going for it. And that&#x27;s before we think about dissecting the C
grade cast of actors who are as muddled as the plotting is. Then the
dialogue, oh dear oh dear, we don&#x27;t expect Citizen Kane, but come on.
Milla Jovovich at least earns her pay as an effective heroine, but
under Paul W.S. Anderson&#x27;s direction she&#x27;s only really dressed up to
please horny teenage boys, with one &#x22;money&#x22; shot thrown in by way of
desperation one feels. <br /><br />3/10 for Milla&#x27;s spunky bravado, Colin Salmon&#x27;s bemusement at being in
such trash and the unnerving AI: Red Queen who out acts all of the
cast.
