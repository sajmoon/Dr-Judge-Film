I was very excited when I saw the trailer for Resident Evil and, after
seeing the movie, I'm not at all disappointed.  It had an interesting plot
with a lot of twists and stuff to think about, which is
nice.<br /><br />The body count is enormous, which always helps, and there's plenty of
graphic violence for those who like that kind of stuff.<br /><br />Couldn't be happier about Milla Jovovich being in the movie.  She is
extremely hot (and scantily clad the majority of the time) and does a good
job with all the action sequences as well.<br /><br />All in all, a great movie.  Definitely go see it.
