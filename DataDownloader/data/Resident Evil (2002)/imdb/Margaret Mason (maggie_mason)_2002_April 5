<br /><br />This movie rocked hard. I really hope that there is a sequel to it. Milla
was just great and Rodrigues was great--shame what happened to her though.<br /><br />The plot was well laid out and I thought was blood filled and intriguing
enough to be eye stimulatingly pleasing.<br /><br />GREAT horror/Zombie movie.
