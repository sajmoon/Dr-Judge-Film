I love the plot of this movie; exciting, fast pace, and with more than a
few
&quot;freeky parts.&quot;  I've played the games and I think they could have stayed
a
little bit more faithfull to the them, though I am perfectly content with
the way it is.  Contrary to what is said above, Milla Jovovich is my
favorite actress and I like what she brought to the screen.  As if zombies
weren't enough, the Red Queen adds a little something special.  I was a
bit
surprised and taken aback by the ending:  wasn't really expecting
that.
