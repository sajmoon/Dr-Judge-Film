It is not a hard concept to gage. If you loved the game, then you will
thoroughly enjoy this film.  Resident Evil is one of the best
Sci-Fi/Action
Horror films ever made.<br /><br />My obviously personal favorites are *Rain* played by Michelle Rodriquez
and
The *Red* Queen voiced by Michaela Dicker. They interestingly enough, take
on lives of their own...
