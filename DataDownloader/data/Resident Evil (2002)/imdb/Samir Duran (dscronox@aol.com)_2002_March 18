Wow, what a great movie. Then acting was good, the script was good, the
special effects were great and Mila Jovovich is fine. Paul Anderson may have
finally done a good movie. Though, I only have one problem with his movie,
what's with the transforming Licker? They never transformed in the games. Me
and a few friends actually stayed up all night after seeing this movie
debating this, and still haven't figured out how this one transformed.
Though, it is a movie.<br /><br />So, when are they going to win an Emmy?
