2002_May 5 

What I liked about this movie was that it was a big mystery that caused
the
zombies to form. Eventually they figured it out.
This movie was based on a computer game. It was a great transition between
gaming and cinema.
I thought there wasn't enough action in this movie. It seemed pretty
boring
at first but it turned out to be an OK movie.
Some of the special effects were a little cheesy. You could tell it wasn't
real. If a monster appears and doesn't look real, it won't scare you as
much
as a monster that seems lifelike.<br /><br />Resident Evil wasn't as good as I thought it was. But it was still an OK
movie. I would certainly not put it in my Top 20 favourite movies. I'm
looking forward to a sequel if there is going to be one.<br /><br />I rate this movie 7.5 out of 10
