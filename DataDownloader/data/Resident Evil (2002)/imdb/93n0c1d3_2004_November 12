I'm a fan of the game myself and have tried real hard to appreciate the
movie, but failed to do so..What makes the game so addictive is its
compelling-superb-story-telling,apart from its well-known horror and
action genre..But the movie failed to deliver all that,and crippled by
poor script and dialog..The sequence of the plot is so low-paced;and
kept me as audience bored and waiting for something to happen..i can
give credit for special effects though, because its not half-bad..but i
always rate a movie emphasizing on its story and actor's performance,
not it's special effects.. If i want special effects to enjoy my time,i
would rather stick to the game..
