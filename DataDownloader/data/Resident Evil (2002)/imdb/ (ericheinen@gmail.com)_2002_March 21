Walking into the theater to watch this, I was filled with trepidation:
another video-game franchise to film stinker? As a fan of the entire
Capcom
RE series, and an ardent consumer of all things horror, (most notably Dawn
of the Dead, etc.) I figured that even if the film was a cheeseball
affair,
it would taste reasonably well going down.
An hour and a half later, I walked out, thrilled and incredulous that
Anderson had pulled it off. Genuinely creepy set pieces that echoed the
game's sense of isolation were in place, somber, non-humorous atmosphere
pervaded the film like a (ahem) virus, and the acting, while not worthy of
an nod from oscar, was believable.
This is a zombie film, so treat it as such. If you're going to suspend
your
disbelief for that premise, than everything else follows accordingly. CG
is
used, but not to the point of ad nauseaum. The story is perfunctory, your
typical barricaded/outnumbered/who will survive? outline, but the
challenge
of making the plot work for fans of the gaming series and walk-in viewers
was met admirably.
Some gripes: whatever happened to gruesome gore in genre films? I'm no
sadist, but if a head is going to get lopped off, then, dammit, I want to
see some arterial spray! I haven't seen any graphic madness since the late
80s/early 90s, but I suppose that's a personal issue. Also, continuity:
don't have characters dispatching zombies with twenty gunshots while
having
other characters disposing of said undead with a kick to the head- it
doesn't mix. That's about it.
Great ending, engaging sense of tension and some effective 'jump' moments
made this a helluva good rollercoaster ride for everybody in the movie
theater I attended.
