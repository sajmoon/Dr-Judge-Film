i am so glad the original script for this movie was scrapped. it would have
been another dawn of the dead, boring slow, you get the picture.anyway, when
me and my son sat down, it was like a hour and 20 minute ride. non stop
action, great special effects. the hallway scene with the security laser's
was enough to get me going. then we get to the zombies, moving fast and
looking good, well bad , you know what i mean. the critics tore this movie
apart but i knew before i sat down that not one of these critics have played
or lived the &quot;re&quot; experience. you have to know the game to enjoy the movie.
great job and can't wait for part 2.   8/10
