Underground research facility: Bad
Zombies: Bad
Bang bang: Zombie dead<br /><br />Gimme a friggin break.  The only interesting character in this ridiculous
piece of schlop is Milla Jovovich.  
 
This movie wasn't worth paying full price.  You're better off renting this
for 99cents.  I Like action movies but this movie was as good as Mortal
Kombat: Annihilation.  Yeah, they both sucked big time.  The Resident Evil
sequel better be a hell of a lot better than this pile of worthless dredge. 
I'm really starting to lose faith in the director.  His best work was Mortal
Kombat I.  Alas, he still has time to redeem himself.
