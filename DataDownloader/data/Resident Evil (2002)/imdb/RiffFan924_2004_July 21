This is not supposed to be a scary movie. Its supposed to be a
sci-fi/action/thriller. It succeeded all expectations I had for it (which
were many). I don't think this movie could have been done any better. And
thank God, &quot;RE2: Apocalypse&quot; is coming out in a couple of months, because
that movie is going to kick some (pardon the pun) zombie buttocks! This
movie also had a killer soundtrack too! I'm wondering if the same people
that did the soundtrack for this one did the soundtrack for Freddy vs.
Jason, because they both had great soundtracks. What sucks though is Marilyn
Manson (I hate the way he his but he's a good musician) isn't returning to
do the score for &quot;Apocalypse&quot;. Sorry this is turning out to be more of a
message board answer than anything. Here's a review for those of you who
haven't seen this movie yet!<br /><br />You know what, just go out and rent the movie or buy it for cheap, because
it rocks no matter what!
