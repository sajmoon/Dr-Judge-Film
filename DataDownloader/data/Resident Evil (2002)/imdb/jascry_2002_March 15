Just got back from seeing Resident Evil. Based on the fact that the theater
was sold out for every showing today (including the 11:40pm I went to) I'd
guess that it's definitely going to be a hit. It should be. It has
everything someone expecting a movie based on the game should have. You
have
the house (albeit briefly), the dogs, Umbrella Corporation, the licker
thing, the T-Virus and, oh yeah, the zombies. Add on some very nice
gratuitous shots of Milla Jovovich completely naked and you've got the
whole
package.<br /><br />What doesn't this film have? Let's see... a well written story, well done
CGI, tension, scares and, oh yeah, GORE. Yes there's some blood in it but
the camera is always cutting away when a scene that would require gore
comes
up. Maybe they cut all of the gore to get an R rating as I've read but
there's so little that I think it would practically be PG if not for
Milla's
nudity and the work f**k used 1 or 2 times. How they could have turned down
George Romero's script and fired him as director and then thought that Paul
Anderson was making a better movie I have no idea.<br /><br />So what we have here is an extremely mainstream version of what Hollywood
thinks a horror movie should be. Horror fans will probably be very
unimpressed with it. If you've nothing to do and need to kill 90 minutes
then there are worse things you could occupy your time with but certainly
don't go out of your way to see it.
