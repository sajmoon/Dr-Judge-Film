the Michael enjoys this movie because of its dark environment and
storyline. This movie (unlike the sequel) focuses mainly on thrills and
horror scenes. (which I like). Trapped Underground in a secret science
facility, surrounded by zombies sounds kind of dull, but this movie
proves it wrong. This movie is well made and greatly preformed by Milla
Jovovich, (my favorite), and the rest of the cast. It has a well
thought story and ending. People think videogames turned movies are
bad. Well, some of them are, but this movie doesn&#39;t count as one of
them. Much more creepier than would be expected. the Michael says this
movie is good to watch. the Michael has spoken.
