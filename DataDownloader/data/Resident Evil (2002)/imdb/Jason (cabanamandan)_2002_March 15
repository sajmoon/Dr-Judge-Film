All in all, solid movie, great effects and bells and whistles!<br /><br />The only thing that you might find confusing about it if you followed the
video game storylines and expected it to be the same in the movie, but its
not..nothing is...but that's not a bad thing<br /><br />I would just like to say THIS IS ABOUT THE ONLY VIDEO GAME MOVIE THAT
DOESN'T SUCK!<br /><br />ahem<br /><br />Anyways I wouldn't mind seeing this again, I even hate freaking
zombies......freaking zombie in the water at beginning....<br /><br />As I said, good movie I recommend it for a big group of friends or you
won't
wanna sit through it...I played off my jumps by scratching my
knee....<br /><br />And this movie has sequel written all over it, I can't
wait!<br /><br />Wooo!<br /><br />Super Mario Brothers The Movie eat this!
