The fact that the movie is based on a videogame hurt the movie
at
the box office because it turns off mainstream audiences. But
all
the stinkers based on videogames, like Street Fighter and
Super
Mario Brother, or mediocre attempts like Mortal Kombat and
Tomb
 Raider, had a problem with the translation. Resident Evil in
the
other hand is a very cinematic videogame, which makes it
a
natural for a movie translation.<br /><br />Just to say that a couple of things from the videogame would
have
helped this be a much better movie. Unlike the videogame,
the
movie environment looks too clean and bright for the horror
factor.
If you've seen films like &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; you know than an
eerie
atmosphere makes the movie scarier tenfold. The camera angles<br /><br />for the videogame which makes a sense of uneasiness, are
very
scattered through the movie, and the techno soundtrack,
though
good in the action scenes, is annoying at some points.<br /><br />The combination of horror, science fiction, and action is not
an
easy task for any film, which is an effort worth of appreciation
for
this film. The plot is also interesting, and original though it
borrows
from other action and horror films.<br /><br />I hope somehow this movie makes up for the cool box office
reception on video and by word of mouth. The R rating didn't
help,
but it was right for the story.
