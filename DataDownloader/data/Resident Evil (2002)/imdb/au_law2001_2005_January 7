Well after the waiting, we finally get a Resident Evil movie at last,
but not in the way we expected it to be. Sure, normally it would not be
directly based on the games, so they would put something else instead
to make it worthwhile to see. But what we get is something a little
disappointing. It seems to tell a bit of a sensationalized story
instead of the on in the game, and it seems to lack a bit of the horror
and fun from the games, at least it still has the T-virus, I'm glad and
thankful for that. And there are some STARS in it, and zombies, and dog
zombies, and lickers, but it lacks the feel, it doesn't seem all that
exciting, more of a generic zombie movie, doesn't even surpass the Dead
trilogy. In other word it just doesn't have the spirit of the games.
But despite all that, it's good to see it isn't like the other failed
movies from video games, like Street Fighter, or Super Mario Bros, or
Double Dragon, yuck! It had creepy monsters and a shocking ending, so
they are forgiven. But still, I wish it was Romero, instead of
Anderson, I believe it would have captured the feel of the games. &gt;&gt;&gt;
5.5/10
