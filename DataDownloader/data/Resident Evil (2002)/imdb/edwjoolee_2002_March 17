See Milla Jovovich karate kick and blow away zombies, mutants and beasts in
this fast-paced and action-packed genre blender. Is the film good? Yes, if
you like mindless action/horror film with scenes that are less-than-original
and derivative, but well-done with some genuinely tense and scary moments.
Is the film violent? Somewhat, but not as much as I had hoped. Actually, it
has surprisingly less gore than the video game from which it was adapted.
Will this film win any Academy awards? Are you on drugs? Of course not, this
is a mindless actioner that you will probably forget once you leave the
theatre. Recommended.<br /><br />
