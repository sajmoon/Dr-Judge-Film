I didn't know what to expect from this. I had played the video game a bit,
but went into this not knowing what was going to happen. This movie is a
non-stop action/thriller/horror movie that will make you jump out of your
seat a lot! I loved it. They did a great job with this film. Not a dull
moment! I highly recommend it. It has an amazing plot considering it came
from a video game. Can't wait for the sequel. (Warning: This might give
some
of you nightmares.)
