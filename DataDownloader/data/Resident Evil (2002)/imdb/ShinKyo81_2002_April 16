&quot;Resident Evil&quot; is one of those films that I was expecting with great
interest. When the first rumors begun, George A. Romero was in charge of
the
project. When he jumped out the film, the name of Paul W. Anderson
appeared,
and everybody thought &quot;That guy rings me a bell...&quot;.<br /><br />After some research, you realize Anderson as the director of controversial
films such as &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; or &quot;Event Horizon&quot;. And I say controversial
because Paul's films have always had such great success and criticism both
at the same time. And &quot;Resident Evil&quot; will be the next
victim...<br /><br />&quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; was a decent project that came out the same time &quot;Street
Fighter&quot; did. I admit both films are not a perfection, but Anderson
created
a better film than Steven de Souza's one. So, and possibly because of the
cheesy adaptation of CAPCOM's videogame, &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; succeed in the
duel, with good special effects and a few kicks and punches.<br /><br />&quot;Event Horizon&quot; is one of my favourite movies, combining gore and horror
in
a very dark atmosphere, which makes this film unique in its genre. It went
through the cinemas with little success, but now it's on my TOP10 list.
Anderson did a fine job with this movie, helped with the cast crew that
were
incredible (Sam Neil and Laurence Fishburne).<br /><br />And now we have &quot;Resident Evil&quot;. First, I quickly recognized the same dark
atmosphere of &quot;Event Horizon&quot; in &quot;RE&quot;. This strange way of Anderson to use
the colours and the flashbacks, and also some scenarios were exactly
reproduced from the videogame saga. The zombie makeup was very good, using
CGI to create more realistic details. The Licker... well, if you survived
watching the &quot;Brotherhood of the Wolf&quot;'s monster, you'll manage this one
:P.<br /><br />Also, the movie has got incredibly good soundtrack: hard rock from Marylin
Manson, Fear Factory, Rammstein and many others; and it fits perfectly
with
the film. And in addition, the movie has got very good rythm of action, so
it absorbs you inside.<br /><br />The good points of the film: Milla Jovovich (of course ^_^), Paul
Anderson's
peculiar style, tons of action, some good scares and brilliant rythm. The
bad points: the cast crew doesn't give an incredible performance, the
whole
plot is quite messy and the ending is too unconcluded (Sequel needed right
now!). And in several scenes you can see the microphone (Anderson check
out
the takes next time, please)!!! :-P<br /><br />Well, if you liked the other Paul Anderson productions (I haven't seen
&quot;Soldier&quot;, though), you'll really enjoy this one. And if you're also a fan
of the videogames, then you'll die for watching &quot;Resident Evil&quot; again and
again. Waiting for the RE2! Worth a look! 8/10<br /><br />
