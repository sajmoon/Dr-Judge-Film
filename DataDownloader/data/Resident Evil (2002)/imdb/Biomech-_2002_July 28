I actually got this on import as soon as it was released on dvd being a fan
of the videogames and Event Horizon [Paul Anderson]. Simply put, it is a
good film. Various aspects of the videogame are kept in the film, notibly
some camera shots. The music throughout the film is interesting and fitting
yet can become somewhat tedious.
Personally I found that while watching the film, I felt I was alsways
waitng
for something that I just couldnt put my finger on, then at the end I
realised, what your waiting for is the sequel. Now I dont mean this in a
bad
way, at the end of the film you get a real sense of &quot;great here's where the
action begins&quot;. Resident Evil is only an introduction to the whole resident
evil saga, and it fufills this well without leaving you feeling
cheated.
I was quite surprised when watching, as there is little blood and no guts
what-so-ever, so to class it as a &quot;zombie movie&quot; doesnt seem right, more of
a horror-thriller, which in fact it claims to be.
Various aspects of the CGI were inpressive, although I did find the licker
seemed to be missing something.
Good performances by all the cast, although after watching this you may
begin to hate Michelle Rodrigez as, yet again, she plays the same hard-core
&quot;bitch&quot; with an attitude, at points coming out with some very bad lines.
Personally, I'm finding her a bit tiresome.
Overall a good movie and worth buying, I tend to also get the sequel on
import too, so we'll see how they have handled that. 8/10
