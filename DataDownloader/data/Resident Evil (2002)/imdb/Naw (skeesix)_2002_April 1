I didn't think I could ever be this scared by a movie.
Wow.<br /><br />The fact that a movie like this could be made scares me like I haven't been
scared since the last time Sinbad had work.<br /><br />And the fact that everyone seems to think this is a good movie... I've
never
been more scared to procreate.<br /><br />This movie gets 2/10 stars for the soundtrack and Milla. It might be OK if
you were to forget that movies are supposed to have a screenplay.
