Having never played the &#145;Resident Evil' video games this was all new to me.
Many of my friends have berated this movie for ignoring the storyline of the
games, but having never experienced them myself, this was a totally new
experience to me.<br /><br />The plot for this movie centres around the headquarters of one of the
world's largest companies. After a chemical container is broken and the
contents released, the super-computer in charge of the place immediately
takes over the facility and locks everybody in. A few hours later a small
military force is sent in to try and regain control but unfortunately for
them, the computer is not their only concern.<br /><br />In my opinion, &#145;Resident Evil' is an average zombie/action movie with a few
interesting and exciting moments, but equally as many downfalls. There is an
over-abundance of poor and unrealistic CGI throughout the movie which really
harms the atmosphere that is trying to be created by director Paul W.S.
Anderson. Combining some interesting camera work with some chilling visuals
Anderson is able to bring the viewer into the movie; however the viewer is
quickly snapped back to reality once one of the unrealistic CGI effects
makes an appearance. This is a major floor, for the same price as the CGI
the makers could have just as easily bought the materials to make great
artificial effects such as those from &#145;The Thing' (1984) or &#145;Hellraiser'
(1987) but alas, in these days of Hollywood big-budget horror, the brilliant
effects of yesteryear are being replaced with mediocre CGI effects which can
seriously damage a movie.<br /><br />The use of flashback images was also utilised in the movie, and while I feel
that some were used to good effect and added some much-needed history to
&#145;Resident Evil', I have to think that many of the flashbacks were filler
used to generate a quick scare, as they were generally accompanied with loud
music (as per all Hollywood horror movies).<br /><br />The screenplay also has some major flaws too in my eyes. Milla Jovovich was
fairly good (though far from perfect) as Alice in the movie, but her part
seemed to be written so ineptly. Considering what events are portrayed that
revolve around her in the movie the script doesn't seem to fit the events. I
found it hard to believe that she would not be more on edge and
questionable, instead she seemed to just take a c'est la vie approach and
accept what was going on too easily. I think there was a lot missing from
the script that should have been included; a little more character
interaction, for instance, would have aided this production in my
opinion.<br /><br />The rest of the cast were average at best. I never have been a fan of
Michelle Rodriguez's acting abilities. Once again she plays the typical
`tough chick' roll that has so far been so predominant in her career, yet
she continues to irritate me in this role as she also did in &#145;The Fast and
the Furious' (2001). I'm not really much for her at all and can see her
career fading out pretty fast unless she can break out of the roll she has
now been typecast in.
Martin Crewes, who I remember from the Sky One UK TV series &#145;Dream Team',
played the part of Chad Kaplan very well in my opinion. I wasn't previously
a fan of him as an actor but out of the actors in &#145;Resident Evil' I found
his to be the best performance in the movie as he did manage to attract some
sympathy for his character and, in my opinion, managed to hold the
production together.<br /><br />There were some good and entertaining action scenes in the movie. One scene
in the Red Queen's Chamber was particularly exciting and even slightly
intense, but these moments of 'Resident Evil' were few and far between which
was a shame. Unfortunately the makers seemed to try and highlight the
subtexts of the movie rather than the plot in hand which led to a rather
poor lack of action and excitement.<br /><br />This film was a little of a let down and is definitely not anything new in
the horror genre as it recycles some of the successful elements of Romero's
&#145;Dead' trilogy and adds a 21st Century perspective. &#145;Resident Evil' is
somewhat unimaginative and I do believe that more could have been done with
the film. Little tension or suspense is eventually built despite the
attempts by Anderson to create an atmosphere; in the end the usual loud
noise scare tactics of all modern-mainstream horror productions were
resorted to and unfortunately damaged what could have been a great movie. 
It's worth checking out once, though I'm not sure if I will ever personally
come back to this movie. My rating for &#145;Resident Evil' &#150;
6/10
