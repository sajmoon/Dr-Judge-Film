This movie is the best zombie movie I've ever seen. Even though the
movie doesn't have any characters from the games it was still a great
movie. The movie is based on the games. Paul W.S. Anderson did a
wonderful job on this movie. The Licker is the coolest creature in the
movie. This movie scared me the first time I saw it in theaters. The
movie's zombies even look like real zombies you can't get that out of
Dawn Of The Dead or another zombie movie. I loved this movie and I
always was a fan of Resident Evil. Now I'm even a bigger fan since I
saw Resident Evil on the big screen. Hopefully Paul will make more
Resident Evil movies. I can watch this movie again and again and not
get bored with it.
