Resident Evil was Milla&#x27;s first &#x22;I can do it all by myself role, and
the double edged sword of being in a pretty good and
more-successful-than-they-thought film is that so far she has had to
star in three sh*tty sequels.<br /><br />Resident Evil was alright though, and for a while it was a minor
highlight in the awful game or comic book to film group.<br /><br />Resident Evil takes place in an underground facility run by the
Umbrella Corp, located beneath Raccoon City, both names classic
examples of why foreign game developers should consult with native
English speakers if they plan to prepare a game for that market.<br /><br />Have you ever heard of a city as stupidly named as Raccoon City? Would
you choose to live there? Wouldn&#x27;t you fully pull the p*ss out of
anyone that you knew that did live there? I mean seriously... And if
they worked for Umbrella Corp wouldn&#x27;t that only sweeten the deal? I
mean Umbrella Corp?!? In essence the big-nawty Umbrella Corp (tee-hee)
has made some whiz bang virus that has apparently been unleashed in the
massive underground research facility, and the thousands of staff
working there have been locked in to prevent the virus from escaping.<br /><br />The full implications of the virus are unknown, and the impact of the
virus on the trapped staff is not shown in the early goings on, we do
see in some initial moments that it isn&#x27;t all sunshine and rainbows for
everyone though.<br /><br />Cut! And Scene! Milla J wakes up nekkid on the floor of a running
shower, how long the shower was running wasn&#x27;t calculatable but her
pale white skin showed no signs of &#x22;pruning&#x22;, I looked... for a long
time... in freeze frame.<br /><br />Milla looks around to find herself in a large mansion-y building, with
evidence that she lives there, and clothes carefully laid out for her.
Now dressed in a strange fanboy-fantasy outfit of a red dress over
combat boots (which she later adds a black leather jacket to. Huh?),
Milla has no memory, no weapons, or no understanding of why she is
there. At this stage I&#x27;m not sure if she even knew she was supposed to
be acting, all she did was look around with wide eyes and her lower lip
perpetually dropped for her early scenes.<br /><br />A strike team shows up with a squad leader who looks very much like a
robot (mouth closed though), it appears that Milla has something to do
with things, how or what we don&#x27;t know yet. At least she now has
friends.<br /><br />And a name, Alice.<br /><br />The team announce their intentions to move into the underground
facility, now dubbed the Hive, to see exactly what is going on. They
enter through a sneaky door in the Milla-Mansion.<br /><br />After a short zip down into the Earth on a subway style train system
the crew end up at the gates of the underground Hive, from here on in
numerous variations of &#x22;JUMP&#x22; scares are the order of the day, each
with an accompanying &#x22;BOO&#x22; noise.<br /><br />Their mission takes them to where the AI system that runs security for
the facility, called Japanese-game-developerly the Red Queen, &#x22;she&#x22; is
personified by a hologramatic young girl with a British accent, who
thankfully seems also programmed to spout menacing dialogue when it is
deemed to be most unsettling.<br /><br />Like a rapping granny, a &#x22;black-acting&#x22; old white guy or a talking
animal in an ad or kid&#x27;s film (non-animated, cartoons are supposed to
talk), it just gave me the sh*ts.<br /><br />There is a cool visual, but logically stupid scene in a security
hallway, where a series of laser patterns sweep the hall, starting with
a straight laser that they can step over, and progressing to more
complicated patterns that begin wiping off various digits and limbs,
before expanding into a Julianne style dicing pattern that shreds all
inside.<br /><br />Why have the first three or four patterns before bringing out the sure
fire crowd pleaser? <br /><br />Anyone who has played the game knows that it is about fighting Zombies,
and as 99.3% of viruses nowadays in films create nothing but Zombies it
seems why don&#x27;t we just acknowledge that they are already here? <br /><br />Once the Zombies arrive it seems clear that the crack squad aren&#x27;t
really that well-trained, many of them simultaneously lose the plot and
they seem to scatter in all directions, there is also much infighting
and bickering, and it takes them forever to realise that a headshot
drops their assailants.<br /><br />Alice rapidly comes to realise that whoever she is and however stupidly
she is dressed that she has skillz, and that these skillz are effective
VS zombies and zombie-dogs alike. (Although if you watch the couple
scenes where she fires a gun pay attention to her eyes, she blinks hard
with EVERY shot fired. I guess some models turned actresses just aren&#x27;t
cut out to be cold calculated cinematic assassins.) After escaping the
initial onslaught the survivors discover they have only a limited time
to escape before they are forever shut in (and therefore dead), which
you would have thought relevant information to know prior to heading
in! There are various sub-plots that mean little and add nothing to the
film from this point. The zombies seem to inexplicably vanish from the
film for very long stretches after the first headlong rush and a new
CGI-assisted menace is introduced, I guess sort of like a level-boss in
the game really.<br /><br />Final Rating - 6.5 / 10. Despite all the sarcasm and crap written above
this is actually an effective little movie, it can&#x27;t help it that it
was followed by three sub-terrible sequels... so far.<br /><br />If you liked this review (or even if you didn&#x27;t) check out
