Another Game turned movie? Possibly.  I thought that the plot was quite
original and the director had taken a few good concepts out of the game to
make this an enjoyable film.  The flashbacks really gave me an
understanding
of how the main character was regaining her memory and playing her own
individual game where she has to find out about herself.<br /><br />Graphics or special effects were good although I thought the end of game
monster could have been a little harder to kill?  Were they all playing on
easy mode?<br /><br />The camera work was excellent but unfortunally I think that the boom guy
(the one holding the mic!) needs to go to the gym.  Every five seconds you
catch a glimpse of what could be a tentical and your imagination runs
wild,
but disapointment when you realise its the sound boom!<br /><br />Overall, a better story than tomb Raider and Worth seeing.  Plenty of
scope
for Resident Evil 2,3,4,5.
