I admit to not being a fan of horror movies, zombie movies, etc. I get
easily scared by movies (pathetic, but true). I didn't sleep for months
after seeing The Relic several years back. That's why I thought it was
pretty sad that Resident Evil only had one scene that freaked me out,
and that was the people stuck in the elevator having to listen to the
screaming of the other people in the falling elevator (and the crash
when it hit the ground) just before theirs fell. It wasn't
jump-out-of-my-seat frightening, but it definitely gave me chills. The
rest of the movie was pathetic and I laughed at the licker. When even
I'm not scared, it's not worth a horror genre fan's time.
