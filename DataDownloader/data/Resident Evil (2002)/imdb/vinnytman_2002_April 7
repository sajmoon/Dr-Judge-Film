2002_April 7 

Okay, I thought &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; was just okay, but at least they had a great
director (Simon West), and actors that could actually act -- and a little
bit of a story mixed in with all the action.<br /><br />&quot;Resident Evil&quot; is just plain BORING! I almost fell asleep watching this
trash. There was one good scene of action, but other then that, the acting
was HORRIBLE (I can't emphasize that enough!), and the action -- what
little
there was -- was just plain boring! The movie was ridiculous! I rate this
up
there with Stallone's movie &quot;Driven&quot; as one of the WORST movies ever
made!<br /><br />Director Paul Anderson needs to get back to his roots. He made an
entertaining movie with the ORIGINAL &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (the sequels were
awful
though), but at least &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; had some great cinematography, and
special effects! It was an action flick...<br /><br />If you haven't seen Paul Anderson's first movie entitled &quot;Shopping&quot; you
are
really missing out... the BEST movie he's ever made -- and one of my
favorite movies of all time! So it's a disappointment that after his first
film, he started making trash! He's a talented director, but I think needs
to make better choices, and start doing better movies like his
action-director counterparts (i.e., Simon West, Michael Bay) who have
moved
on to not only do action films, but action films with strong characters
driving the story -- like Paul Anderson did with &quot;Shopping&quot;.<br /><br />He needs to be getting back to his roots and start making his characters
more interesting, since he wrote and directed &quot;Resident Evil&quot; he takes the
blame for the entire flick being bad!
