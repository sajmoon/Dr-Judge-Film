Although Resident Evil the game was a wonderful experience, I can't say that
the film was as scary as the gameplay.<br /><br />The film takes all aspects of the game and tries to mimic it as best it can
but the realism of the game can't be portrayed on the widescreen. Thats not
to say the film isn't worth seeing because it is a whole new experience in
itself. Good plot. Good acting. Huge soundtrack. DVD should be good if the
endings could be edited.
