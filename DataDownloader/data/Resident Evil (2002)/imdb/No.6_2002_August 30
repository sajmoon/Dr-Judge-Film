...but pretty close. Paul Anderson turns out another pathetic
movie, this
time however, he decides to taint the zombie genre. This movie is nearly
unwatchable on every level. The worst part is probably the script. Many of
the lines would seem stupid even in the video game that it is based on.
Furthermore the exposition scenes are handled with the subtleness of a
high-school student film. Anderson &quot;borrows&quot; liberally from much better
movies such as the classic Romero &quot;Dead&quot; trilogy. If this movie does
nothing
else, it should prove that Paul Anderson should never be allowed on a movie
set ever again.
