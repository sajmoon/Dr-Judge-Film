Based on the popular video game (they made a couple of comics too) this
movie is just what the doctor ordered for us Zombie flick
fans.<br /><br />A secret Umbrella Corporation research facility becomes infected with a
virus it was developing and the computerised security system sealed it off
completely, leaving the present staff to die while exposed to the
virus.<br /><br />Since nobody knows what went wrong, a SWAT-type team is sent in to
investigate. On their way in they run into Alice (Milla Jovovich) and
Spence
Parks. They guard the entrance to the facility and were rendered
unconcious
by the security system and as a result of which suffer some memory loss.
Also tagging along is cop Matt Addison who just happened to be there when
the team arrived.<br /><br />They get in, run into lots and lots of nasties and need to get out in one
piece. There's a few plot twists in there to keep things entertaining for
people looking for a nice story, and for the hormone-driven males there's
a
couple of nice partial nudity shots of lovely Milla. It doesn't get in the
way of the action though, and there's plenty of that.<br /><br />The biggest flaw in the story is when the lasers come into play. The last
type of laser used is the most effective, and it makes you wonder why the
security system didn't use it immediately and get it over with. The rest
of
the story is solid as far as I can tell, and pretty much in sync with the
game.<br /><br />Now, as I said this is a very good zombie movie. There's a lot of them,
and
the special effects budget was well spent using mainly make-up effects,
and
saving the big bucks for the biggest nasty of them all (a 'licker', to
those
familiar with the game) which is played by the computer.<br /><br />There's practically no gore in the movie. Sure, there's the bruises and
wounds a zombie is likely to inflict, but no zooming in on it, or
excessive
blood squirts. I actually counted a total of one scene I would consider
somewhat gory (when they reach the train on the way out), and it wasn't
that
bad.<br /><br />The acting by most of the credited cast was okay. The zombies on the other
hand were excellent. Normally they disappoint by trying too hard to act
somewhat dead or by standing still while clawing at a character. In this
movie they do what you expect them to do and do it well.<br /><br />I'm giving this one an 8 out of 10. If you're into zombie movies (and I am
in a BIG way) it's highly recommended. If you're just looking for some
good
scares, this movie delivers. Go see it. You will not be
disappointed.
