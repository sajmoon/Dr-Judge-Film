Everything about this film is bad: performances were non-existent, design
and photography tacky and tasteless, the special effects were poor (the
'licker' on the PS1 looked just as realistic as the one in the film),
script
shambolic (full of stereotypes, cliches and RIP OFFS - watch Aliens if you
don't believe me) and direction unimaginative and lazy.<br /><br />Its just sad to read what people who liked this film have to say on this
site - have these people never watched any decent films in their lives
compare this rubbish to?! Do they only watch what Hollywood vomits into
their cinemas or on their TVs?! To say that this is a good movie just
shows
plain ignorance of what it actually takes to make a 'good movie' - these
ignorant troglodytes are killing cinema! AARRRGGGHHH!<br /><br />For all those left wanting for a better zombie horror movie (though RE
hardly qualifies for this genre) try and dig out these juicy morsels:
Plague
of The Zombies (a Hammer Horror classic), Romero's Dawn Of The Dead or
Danny
Boyle's excellent 28 Days Later, and keep your eyes peeled for Shaun of
The
Dead which comes out this year. I'd also recommend playing the original
game
and its sequel on the PS1.<br /><br />I would recommend these films to those of you who actually liked Resident
Evil, but perhaps your too far gone for the 'anti-virus' to have any
effect.
