My gosh, not since John Carpenter's &quot;The Thing&quot; have I been so affected by
a
movie.  It had me with my jacket over my head and squishing in my
seat.<br /><br />Definitely one gory movie ... or was it? Though somewhat graphic in
violence
(as one would expect from a movie about flesh eating zombies) the style of
the film, made it more a tour de force of tension and suspense.  I almost
walked out on the movie early, because I just couldn't sit in my seat in
anticipation of the next horrific scene.<br /><br />It did what it set out to do very well...it scared the sh_t out of
me.
