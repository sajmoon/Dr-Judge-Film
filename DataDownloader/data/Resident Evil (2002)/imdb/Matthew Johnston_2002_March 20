2002_March 20 

This movie has guilty pleasure written all over it: it has no character
development, little revealed plot (it's like an installment of the games -
you're never sure all of what has happened or that will happen in the
future), and, ultimately, no point, but - unless you're adamantly opposed
to
either zombie or video game movies - it's hard to deny how creepy and fun
this film truly is. &quot;Resident Evil&quot; has more than its fair share of
genuine
frights, some nice effects, and very few instances of incredulity when it
comes to keeping certain characters alive - something that's plagued more
than a few thrillers recently (MI2, Gladiator, to name a few). Yes, the
suspense in this film is actual suspense, i.e. in every scene there is the
chance that the main characters could actually lose. The movie plays out
very much like one of the games, which was enough for me to enjoy
it.<br /><br />That said, the movie has its flaws. People needing something deeper than
close calls, gore, and death to enjoy the film will be let down. And there
was certainly opportunity for the film to be more than just another
installment of the game. There was definitely room for character
development, which may not have seemed necessary for game purists
(because,
naturally, in the game you assume the main character's identity and can
identify with their horror in that manner), but usually it is for movies.
There is little room for personal attachment to the characters in the
film,
which is a small let down, good as some of the frights are. The movie also
could have initiated us more in the workings of the Umbrella Corporation.
There's a strong anti-corporation message under all this gore, but it
never
gets fully realized.<br /><br />Still, an overall enjoyable film. The laserbeam scene will go down in film
history. Not for the squeamish.<br /><br />Matty J
