2002_July 3 

I have been a big fan of the video game in which this film is inspired
so I
was very excited as I entered the film room to watch the movie. And
after
around one hundred minutes of action (and little more) I went home very
dissapointed for several reasons.<br /><br />First of all, I don&acute;t think this is a complete movie. I had the
sensation
that what I have just seen it was like a chapter of any T.V. serie. This
film doesn&acute;t have a complete plot or even a finish, it only puts the
things
in order for Resident Evil 2, something that in my opinion it&acute;s
disgusting.<br /><br />Also, there is an abuse of action scenes that completely dominate the
movie.
The action scenes are pretty good, but I would hope to see something
more of
the cerebral element (as it was sometimes in the video game, especially
the
first version).<br /><br />Finally, even the 'big bad boss' you are supposed to watch at the end of
the
film it&acute;s pathetic. But of course this is connected with Resident Evil
2,
when finally a really monster -Matt Adison converted in Nemesis- will
come
into the scene (again, this movie is only a chapter or a presentation of
things to come).<br /><br />So, I only would recommend this film in case you are the purest fan of
the
action movies and have never take care of the video game. Rest of the
world
should eluded it.
