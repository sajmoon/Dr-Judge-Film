This movie is awful and Paul Anderson (Not to be confused with Paul Thomas
Anderson, who is a much more talented director and even though I don't
like
his movies I at least appreciate that he knows how to tell a story)has
accomplished a great feat by making this movie bad on so many different
levels: the plot, the dialogue, the special effects, the acting, the
characterization, the gratuitous nudity (while appreciated by the men in
the
audience was no way justified). If only one of these aspects had been at
fault I could have looked past it but unfortunately nothing was handled
well. Firstly in an age of digital effects like those seen in Lord of the
rings and Spider-man audiences have come to expect good effects not
Zombies
created with a bit of green make-up and dogs covered in tinned spaghetti
the
one digital effect they did spend any money on looked like it was created
on
an etchasketch, I was more impressed with the graphics in the game than
the
film. I understand the budget was fairly low but even low-budget horror
movies have still managed to produce genuinely scaring looking effects,
one
only has to watch &quot;From Dusk 'til Dawn&quot; or &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; to see that.<br /><br />The plot's only good point was that it was an original piece of work
with nothing I could see taken from the game apart from some of the names
and monsters, but if you took away the dogs, the licker, the umbrella
corporation and racoon city and called the virus the U-virus or something
similar then nothing would remind you even slightly of the game, which can
sometimes be a good thing if the writer can come up with an original story
better than the one in the game, but he can't, it's predictable (you know
who the bad guy is after the first 15 minutes) there is no suspense other
than that created by the overly loud sound-track which accompanies ever
scare so you can hear the &quot;surprise&quot; coming every time. In an age of
self-knowing films like &quot;Scream&quot; it's hard to believe that it takes the
characters the entire length of the film to realize their in trouble and
I'm
pretty sure the word Zombie isn't mentioned once. This may have been a
conscious decision to avoid getting called a &quot;typical zombie movie&quot; but
that
is exactly what the film is so why try and disguise it, there are gaping
plot holes that the dialogue tries to cover over but fails, such as how
the
virus goes from an airborne virus, which would presumably affect the
squad,
to a contact transmitted one even though the virus clearly needs to be
injected into rabbits and it would surely make sense to stay as an
airborne
virus to reach as many hosts as possible or to engineer it so that it
couldn't become airborne from a safety point of view not change from one
to
the other as it felt like it.
The dialogue could have been written by a child it was that simple
and
very stupid there was no wit, which is a well established feature of this
type of movie and of life in general, but none of the characters display
this &quot;laugh in the face of danger&quot; attitude audiences have come to expect
and enjoy. I have read the George Romero Script on the net (although there
is no guarantee it was actually written by Romero) and whoever actually
did
write it isn't important as it is much better than the film, even in it's
first draft stage. The numerous characters are all given enough dialogue
to
give you a 3-dimensional feel to them and all are dealt with in a fitting
way, the story is close to the game but still entertaining and
suspenseful,
the creatures are well used and fit in to the story aptly and while it
would
have required a much bigger budget it would have saved me the 2hrs of
boredom sitting through the filmed version gave.
Maybe it is unfair to criticize the acting considering the material
they had but nobody made the most of it and there was never any sense that
they were real people but instead objects to be dispatched by various
badly
conceived monsters and awful special effects. I can only imagine all the
actors involved pleading to be killed off. How Mila Jovovich gets away
with
showing so much flesh in her movies including this one is a question I'd
like answered especially when it is so unnecessary. I wasn't the only
person
in the audience who laughed out loud at some of the terrible scenes in
this
film and I can only hope that Paul Anderson isn't allowed to make any more
films although with him already signed on for Resident Evil 2 it seems the
movie going public will be bored by his awful movies for many years to
come.
An man sitting behind me in the cinema commented, once the film had
finished, that it was &quot;The best film I've ever seen&quot; I can only assume
this
was the first film this person had ever seen.<br /><br />
