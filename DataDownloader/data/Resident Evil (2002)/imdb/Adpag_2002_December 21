I cannot understand why film makers take a source material that they think
will make a good film, then take out everything that made it good in the
first place. For the uninitiated, the original RE video game was a smash hit
because it featured, for the most part, a lone character in a genuinely
spooky mansion never knowing what unspeakable horror was round the next
corner; it also had creepily atmospheric music and unfortunate voice acting.
Sadly, the only element that has been retained for the film version is the
last.<br /><br />Writer-director Anderson must take the blame, and one can only assume that
a) he never actually saw the game; and b) he is so out of touch that he
thinks if you like video games and horror, you must be a young, male, heavy
metal fan. This mess begins and ends with lame attempts to have a not
particularly talented supermodel appear on screen wearing as few clothes as
possible. In between is the aforementioned metal cacophony, bad acting and
uninspiring special effects. The tension that brought the game to life is
completely lacking; the action is rarely involving; and the (very)
occasional shock is not enough to compensate for the unintentional hilarity
of Jovovich, clad in a fashion disaster, turning into an acrobat and
wrenching zombie necks with her thighs.<br /><br />The scariest thing about it is that the sequel, as far as I know, is already
in production - but if you avoid the bargain bins at your local rental
outlet, you may be lucky and miss it altogether.
