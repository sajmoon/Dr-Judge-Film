this is NOT a shallow movie...and there's a plot (given the tripe coming
out
these days, a very well conceived one)...if you think otherwise you
obviously weren't paying a whole lot of attention - you were waiting for
the
film to take you somewhere, waiting for the scares...i mean, anything at
all
can be shallow if you choose not to think about it...<br /><br />upon the entrance of the 'commando's', i was thinking 'dawn of the
dead'...it never lived up to that kind of promise...though if you needed a
prequel to night of the living dead, this might as well be it - who needs a
sequel, go watch the dead series...maybe if george romero was at the helm
it
wouldn't have gone for the cheap scares...and would have leaned more
towards
substance than style...that said, i'm forgiving its pretensions towards
being an action thriller - going for the scares without willing to go all
the way into horror...it could have been so much better...i'm forgiving all
its flaws for being one of the few movies to come out recently i've really
enjoyed and felt engaged in, even if i refused to become so involved as to
react to all the pointless false scares...i'm forgiving it because of its
similiarities to dawn of the dead, day of the dead, and night of the living
dead...guess i'm just a sucker for a zombie flick (not considering the evil
dead a pure zombie film).<br /><br />i won't, however, forgive it for keeping michele rodriguez's character
alive
so long...god how i wanted her to die an agonising death...but them's the
breaks...the most interesting and promising characters for mine were killed
off early...the fact that i care says something about it...but...perhaps i
only care because they resembled the quartet from dawn of the dead. it
doesn't matter. forget the game, forget every movie resident evil owes its
existence to, view it on its own merit...as everyone should do with every
movie based on a book, video game, previous movies, whatever...<br /><br />the only criticism i have is that it lapses towards the end...why did the
male amnesiac have to be portrayed as 'evil'...even for his actions, he
didn't need to be vilified...his was a superfluous character
anyway...that's
where this film fails...it's so obviously a film, it has plot
contrivances...it lacks the realism of george romero's dead
series...<br /><br />but being an action movie, as opposed to a work of art -
8/10.
