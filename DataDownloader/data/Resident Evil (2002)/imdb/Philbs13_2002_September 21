After all the years of watching horror films and seeing how lousy and
contrived and cliche they have become, I went into RE assuming it was
going
to suck because I knew the movie wasn't based on the first few games. I
was
actually stunned at how much I enjoyed RE. Yeah, it took a lot of
liberties
from the games, but it was very close to the story line and actually leads
into the story lines from the games. Anderson did a good job of
translating
the main game elements (a secluded mansion, an underground lab, a viral
outbreak, a mysterious pharmaceutical company and an employee that reports
to somebody on the outside) and managed to wrap it all into one fresh,
suspenseful entity with some nice editing and an energetic score.  There's
been a lot of complaints that the movie has ripped off a lot of films, but
what horror/action movie hasn't ripped off other movies?  And why start
attacking here?  Besides, horror films weren't made to to win Oscars and
shouldn't be critiqued in this manner.  Resident Evil is a fun,
entertaining
film.  And that's all that really matters.
