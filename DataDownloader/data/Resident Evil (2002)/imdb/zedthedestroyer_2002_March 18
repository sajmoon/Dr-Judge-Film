It's a zombie flick loosely based on a video game. I had no other
expectations other than to be entertained for an hour-and a-half. But the
movie went far above my expectations. Yeah, there are similarities to
&quot;Aliens&quot; and every other George Romero Dead flick, but it didn't detract
from my basic enjoyment of the film. With the exception of one or two
exposition scenes in the middle, the movie was non-stop. Milla and Michelle
were great. And the Red Queen was a nice touch.<br /><br />I can't believe how many people are nitpicking over the inconsistancies
between the game and the movie. See it again and suspend your disbelief. I
did and enjoyed it. And I own the first 2 games myself.
