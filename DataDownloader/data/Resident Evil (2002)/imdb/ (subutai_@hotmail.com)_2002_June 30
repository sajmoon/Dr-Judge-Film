I am charmed with this movie. it is perfect because to me I am a fanatic of
the cinema gore and of terror in general, and also fan of the violent, such
video games as the saga RESIDENT EVIL.<br /><br />From beginning until the end, everything is an entertainment, violently,
effective, very rapidly and very terrifying. To the beginning of the movie
someone (who is not known the one who is until the end of the movie),
voluntarily infected with a mortal virus, one makes of Umbrella's
experimentation (the major company of the world), called &quot;the beehive&quot;. All
the personnel die agonizing, after moments, bit a bit, and &quot;the beehive&quot;
remains inactive. There appears Alice (Mile J.) in the shower of the bath,
but she does not remember anything of anything. The mansion appears where
she lives (identical to that of the video game RESIDENT EVIL 1) and on
having tried to go out of the mansion, someone her enters again in the house
by force (the first fright). He is Matt Adison. The group of commands appear
rapidly, breaking the windows of the mansion. The group of commandos this
one led by the commander James (Colin Samon), and formed principally by Rain
(Michelle Rodriguez), Kaplan, Salinas, and Medic.
The commandos interrogate Matt, he says to them that he is a policeman of
Raccon city. nonetheless they take him as a prisoner. Rapidly, and without
explanations, the commander directs to the whole group towards a secret door
that gives to a species of underground. There in the underground stores
(identical to those of a real video game) on having come to the train that
joins the mansion with the beehive, they find Spencer Praks (James P.), who
also suffers of amnesia.He is the supposed husband of Alice. From this
moment, both, Alice and Spencer remember during the whole movie, bit a bit,
recovering the memory.
The whole group goes in train up to &quot;the beehive&quot;. There they discover that
quite this solitary, and the commandos put hands to the work your mission.
They speak about the beehive and of the computer that directs everything and
that supposedly madman has turned, the so called red queen. Immediately, the
commander James and three commandos more, remain caught in a trap. Enclosed
in a corridor, a red laser them is departing from one in one (first, medic
loses the head, after another the fingers of the hand, another commando is
departed in two, and finally the commander is he throw thousand
pieces).
After this unexpected event (and very gore), Alice and the demas, safely
someone already, deactivate the red queen (the first appearance of the
girl). On the other hand, Rain and two commandos more, together with Matt of
prisoner, discover a woman zombie (the first walking zombie, exactly at the
half hour of the movie). The zombie attacks and bites Rain, and the whole
loader shoots this one, but the bush. There joins to the group Alice and the
others, and appears zombies for all sites, surrounding them. There is a
great gunfire, but the commandos do not manage to kill to anybody zombie.
They all try to escape, and ultimately after the alone holocaust they remain
alive, Alice, Matt, Rain, Kaplan, and Spencer. Matt manages to escape of his
captivity and avoids to the offices. Matt, discovers your sister, Liza, but
it is a zombie. Alice fights against the doberman zombie (killing all
spectacularly). Alice kills to Combat, and Matt tells Alice who is a secret
agent with the aim to unmask Umbrella's company and extracting to the light
your secret experiments.<br /><br />From these events, more zombies and spectacular situations. Alice reveals
herself to if same she turns into the real heroine of the movie. In the
distance to your destiny, Rain is attacked and bitten often by some zombies.
They all come to Umbrella's laboratory and there there discovers the reality
of the plot of the movie (Spencer's real role is explained to us, that in
the end, it is the wicked one of the movie). Spencer betrays Alice, and
makes all enclosed. Giant appears the monster zombie and one eats it. The
red queen makes clear that Rain must die in order that the demas survive,
but Alice does not want to kill her. There appears Kaplan, to which him
believe dead man, and he saves to all. The monster zombie giant chases them.
They come to the train and there this one Spencer, dead man. He turns in
zombie and Alice murders it of a palazo in the head. They ignite in train
and flee. Alice gives the antidote against the virus to Rain (that this very
bad). Appears again, the monster zombie giant and kills Kaplan. Alice and
Matt try to kill it but they cannot. Matt is hurt by the monster. Rain turns
in zombie and attacks Matt. Matt kills Rain, and drives also a button in
order that the monster zombie giant is destroyed against the route of
train.<br /><br />Matt and Alice are saved, and are the surviving only ones. On having come to
the mansion, Matt's wound begins to mutar, and Alice scares. They appear
suddenly, a few rare types and they remove them to the two by force. One of
the doctors says: &quot; we will put him in the project NEMESIS &quot;. Alice remains
incoscient. After a relax, Alice wakes up in a room of operations. Alone
this one. There is nobody. Quite this desert. she goes out from the hospital
to the street. There the great this desolate avenue, and everything looks
like a chaos, as if a catastrophe had happened. A newspaper says: &quot; the dead
men walk!! &quot;. Alice takes a shotgun of a car policeman, and wait .... soon
the second part, RESIDENT EVIL &quot;NEMESIS&quot;
