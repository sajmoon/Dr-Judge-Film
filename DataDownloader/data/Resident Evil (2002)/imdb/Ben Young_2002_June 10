So, let me get this straight... they make a movie (Resident Evil), base a
game on the movie (Resident Evil - Playstation), create a sequel (Resident
Evil 2 - Playstation), create another sequel (Resident Evil 3 -
Playstation), and then a cash-in (Resident Evil: Survivor - Playstation),
and another cash-in (Resident Evil: Survivor 2 - Playstation 2), then a
'proper' sequel (Resident Evil Code Veronica - Dreamcast), then a sequel to
that (Resident Evil Code Veronica X), and finally... Resident Evil The
Movie. Tomb Raider sucked, Final Fantasy sucked, so Resident Evil will
probably most likely suck aswell. Why not just re-release the original
Resident Evil?
