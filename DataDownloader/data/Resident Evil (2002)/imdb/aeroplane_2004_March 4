2004_March 4 

I honestly believe that Paul Anderson thinks adding heavy metal music to a
zombie-littered action sequence will somehow improve the genre of
'horror'.
What he fails to see is that Resident Evil in all aspects *should* be
regarded as a horror film (with elements of action.) What he has managed
to
create is some obscene attempt at all-out action (involving horror
elements.) What could possibly go wrong with that? Well, in all honesty;
horror isn't scary with some teenage metal band pounding your ears whilst
a
plague of zombies fills the screen, looking very unimpressive. Where's the
atmosphere? Play the video game - you get bucket-loads; so why isn't that
reflected in the film? I was very disappointed that the film is obviously
aimed at the male 15-18 teenage-angst market, although I guess that's to
be
expected, as it is a videogame.
Overall, tedium... unless you're into loud shouty heavy music interrupting
a
(quite stylistically) shot movie.
Just hope he doesn't **** it up with Alien versus Predator... Yet that
will
be aimed at the same market. Gah! Still, nothing can be as bad as Mortal
Kombat... How could a person who made something as stunningly tense and
atmospheric as Event Horizon make trite like MK and Resident
Evil?<br /><br />I voted this film as a 1-star.
