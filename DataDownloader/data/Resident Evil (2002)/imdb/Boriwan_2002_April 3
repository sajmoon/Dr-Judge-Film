At first, don't expect any surprises of this Movie. Its a straight made,
oldschool Horrorstory about a Team which enters a freaky Area and gets
decimated. Except the fact that Millaaaaa (YESSSS;)!) doesn't remember who
she is, there aren't many new fresh ideas to see. But that's not bad in
this
case. This movie doesn't try to be innovative, it is consequently
straight.
There are no senseless talkings, no absoutely stupid love story and noone
acts like a fool just to make something bad happen.
But bad things happen, and every bad thing that happens is made with much
love. There is this really nasty Horrormaincomputergirl which shows a
really
beasty behavior, there are those lovely undying zombies, those really
dangerous looking creepdogs and this odd monsters from these crates.
Sounds
really ridicoulous but its good mixed and everything fits.<br /><br />I think it's like eating at Grandma ! You get the food at every cheap
restaurant, but from Grandma it just tastes better.<br /><br />Ah and I like the really fine end. FINALLY not this Hollywoodlike going
out
of the House straight in the Morning sun the Boyfriend right in the Hand
and
everything is good.<br /><br />And at last its just another fine movie with Millaaaaaaaaaa (YESSS;)!)<br /><br />
