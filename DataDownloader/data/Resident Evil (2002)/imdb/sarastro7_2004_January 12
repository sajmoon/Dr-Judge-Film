I can't believe that an actress who's been working for so long is still only
29 years old! She ages with supreme grace, and has *never* looked better
than she does in Resident Evil. Wow!<br /><br />The movie itself is fair. Not great, not terrible. Pretty good SFX. It's a
techno zombie thriller, and for what it is, it's effective enough.
Considering how bad movies based on computer games usually are, this one is
pretty good, although it has problems getting started. There are a few
scenes that don't make sense (and that cop - Matthew? - where does he really
come from?), and it's never really clear that there's only one of the CGI
mutating zombie animals loose. The technobabble explanation we get for the
zombies is a worthy attempt to &quot;technofy&quot; the zombie genre, but it doesn't
quite work, esp. not the part about the &quot;need to feed&quot;. All in all the movie
brings back memories of Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, and I'm sure the sequel
will, too.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich gives good face. She doesn't really have anything to do for
the first 45 minutes (other than look beautiful, of course), but she's very
cool when she starts pouring on the kicks and punches, and her character is
likable and heroic (and did I mention good-looking? And that outfit she's
wearing...!). One wants to see more of her. With some better writing, this
sort of role would be perfect for her. Accessible, kick-ass adventure with
an appealing female lead (or several). If movie-makers know what's good for
them, this is the kind of thing they should do more of. Much
more.
