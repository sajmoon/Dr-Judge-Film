This movie was amazing. I sincerely enjoyed it from shocking beginning to
the horrific ending.<br /><br />It was extremely suspenseful, disturbing and interesting all at the same
time. There was the appropriate amount of gore and 'boo' scares in the
film.
The acting was as good as could be expected.<br /><br />I heartly endorse anyone who likes a good scare and a raunchy bit of gore
to
watch this film. Two thumbs and two big toes up!
