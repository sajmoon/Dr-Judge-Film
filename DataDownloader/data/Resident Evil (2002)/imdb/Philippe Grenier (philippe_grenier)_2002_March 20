I have to say, this is quite simply the best game-based movie I have seen
up
to now. With it's outstanding effects, it's not-so-bad plot and finally,
it's frequent heart-pounding surprises, I got more than my money's worth.
Must be seen in theaters to fully experience the sound/visual taunts and
effects. As for Milla, well... She IS, after all, the perfect being, isn't
she?
