I just want to say for every resident evil fan who have'net seen this
movie yet. See it and don't say that the alice character is not in the
game. it's natural , all the movies sometimes made a change a little
bit.<br /><br />The sound and the effect are great too. I will not talk about it so
much , so you can watch it without spioler. <br /><br />Also , My final Advice. Watch the movie in a dark room to feel the
nightmare, to feel what happened to the city, to feel the emotions, to
feel the atmosphere of RESIDENT EVIL.<br /><br />Enjoy.
