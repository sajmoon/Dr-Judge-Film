Having seen just about all video game to movie translations, I was
hesitant
on seeing this movie.  It's apparently not that hard for Hollywood to mess
up making movies based on video games (i.e Super Mario Bros., Double
Dragon,
Street Fighter, Final Fantasy, etc...).  But I must say I was greatly
pleased with the outcome.  Resident Evil is loosely based on the first
game
of the popular franchise of games.  It sort of takes place between part
one
and two.  The acting is not Oscar worthy by any means, but it is not
supposed to be.  What Resident Evil comes down to is that it is a great
horror movie with plenty of gore (gotta LOVE that scene with the room full
of lasers!!!), scary moments and even a little nudity thrown in for good
measure.  The soundtrack kicks major butt as well.  Paul Anderson did a
great job (he also directed Mortal Kombat, one of the few actual good
video
game movies) and I hope he does as well with the sequel due next Summer.
If
you're a fan of the games or just a good horror flick, give this a
shot.<br /><br />Overall:  8.2 out of 10
