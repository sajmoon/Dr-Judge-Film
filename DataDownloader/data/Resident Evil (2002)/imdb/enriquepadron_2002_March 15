This movie was great but it could have used more blood and zombies. The
actors were great and even the acting was good, but the zombies didn't
look
a lot like the ones in the games, some even looked like actors who just
put
some dirt and fake blood on them. They needed to be more gory and bloody.
The plot was great and I am looking forward to the sequel. Also they could
have put more puzzles like the game does, ask questions, riddles, find
these
items and put them together to make a lighter or better gun, stuff like
that.I hope the sequel improves these problems. Go watch this movie, it is
one of the best movies of the year, fill with action pack sequences and
horror.
