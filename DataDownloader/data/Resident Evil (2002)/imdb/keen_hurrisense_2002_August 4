2002_August 4 

Unlike most people, I loved this movie. I thought it was one of the best
game to film movies. I thought the actors did an outstanding job, the story
was well written and not too far from the games storyline. I have played
and
beaten every Resident Evil game, as it is my favorite series. I am very
much
looking forward to Resident Evil 2: Nemesis. This is a definite must see in
my opinion.
