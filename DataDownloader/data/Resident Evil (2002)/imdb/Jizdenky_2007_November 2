2007_November 2 
Normally I tend to avoid films like &#39;Resident Evil&#39; unless when
strongly recommended enough to be convinced. I&#39;d watched it when it
released because my brother kept insisting, telling me what a great
movie it was. I thought it was an okay film with a terrible ending.
Tonight my brother played it on the DVD and I watched it again as my
family as around and I still feel pretty much the same. Though having
the company around didn&#39;t make me feel like I had wasted my time and a
few points I&#39;d like to make about the film.<br /><br />The background score I found to be very impressive. It&#39;s one score I&#39;d
like to own. The special effects are not that bad either and the sense
of isolation and abandon within the building was quite well done. I
liked Milla Jovovich&#39;s acting for most parts. I think she displays the
range of emotions very effectively through her facial expressions and
makes Alice different from a caricature sci-fi horror movie heroine.<br /><br />Now pretty much everything else in &#39;Resident Evil&#39; ranges from mediocre
to bad. There are plenty of ridiculous &#39;jump&#39; giving moments. Though I
didn&#39;t jump at all, I saw my cousin startle at some scenes. The zombies
are laughable. It&#39;s extremely Hollywoodish and the ending, though
unpredictable, was disappointing and in my opinion, silly.<br /><br />However, I didn&#39;t feel as bad as I did after watching it for the first
time. Maybe it&#39;s because of the company I was in or maybe I just
noticed some of the more positive side of the film (which in my opinion
is still limited).<br /><br />Ho
