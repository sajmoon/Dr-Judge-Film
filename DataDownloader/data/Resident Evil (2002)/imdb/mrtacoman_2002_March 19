I went into this movie expecting a decent adaptation of the game series,
but
instead I got Matrix ripoff crap.<br /><br />It's not that the atmosphere wasn't there, my main problems with the film
had to do with the main character played by Milla Jovovich. First off, they
make a big point to show that the zombies can take quite a few bullets
without any effect, yet when Milla kicks a zombie in the chest, it's dead.
Uh huh. Yeah,okay. Then she kills another one by hitting it in the back
with
a paperweight later on. When cornered by the dogs, she manages to hit a
bunch of moving targets with expert accuracy, then kicks a dog who was
jumping while her back is turned, killing it instantly. How'd she know the
dog was jumping? Then there's a damn bullet-time moment towards the end, I
swear the Matrix ruined action films forever with that s***.After seeing
the
film, I can only assume that Resident Evil takes place in The Matrix and
Milla Jovovich is actually The One.<br /><br />Then there's the whole thing that bothered me in the beginning of the film.
The soldiers are strapped to the gills with explosives and automatic
weapons, yet they are unaware of the fact that there are zombies and
creatures in the lab. They think they're just there to shut down a
computer.Why the hell would you need HK's to shut down a frickin computer?<br /><br />Resident Evil would probably be a decent film if I was about 10 years old
and had never played the games. The hand to hand combat aspect was totally
out of place, I know I wouldn't touch an infectious zombie if I were in the
same situation, I think I'd rather run like hell.<br /><br />It is the best video game adaptation to date though, so I had to give it at
least a 2 for effort. Paul Anderson, please leave video games and classic
films alone. If you must continue to make s***** movies, at least ruin
something original and don't bring down the quality of what's already been
made well.
