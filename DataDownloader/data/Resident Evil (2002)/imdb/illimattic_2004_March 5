I love this movie! I like the story, characters, plot and storyline! Milla
Jovovich is great as the female heroine. The zombies are cool, the laser
scene, and the licker.<br /><br />I like the twist near the end, and the ending is the perfect intro to the
sequel. Forget what others have said about the movie, just watch this
movie
for the fun of it!<br /><br />While it may not be as gory as the zombie movies in the past, it is still
good, and this movie doesn't just incorporate zombies, but other enemies
in
the games as well. so its more than just a zombie movie. If you are a
hardcore zombie lover then you might not like it, but otherwise its very
entertaining! If you get into the character's I'm sure you'll like the
film.
My Grade = A.
