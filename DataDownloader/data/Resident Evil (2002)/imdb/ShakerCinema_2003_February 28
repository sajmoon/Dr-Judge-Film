There is a lot to say about Resident Evil, it is probably the best video
game to movie conversion that has ever been released. Then again there has
not been to many in this genre, one such attempt was Tomb Raider and the
Movie was horrible. Anyways this movie has a great story line and a
original
idea for the enemy in the film. Special effects were another strong point
of
this film(especially the laser scene). But despite all the things that
Resident Evil did well on the screen there were a few weak points. One
area
being the cast, I believe there could have been a stronger cast
constructed
for the film, not that the cast for Resident Evil did a bad job but I just
personally believe it could have been done better. And if your a Resident
Evil video game fan which I am, I was a little angry with the fact that
the
movie sort of did a combination of the first and second Resident Evil
Games,
I personally believe that they should have made two separate movies
because
the games had such great story lines, but with that said Resident Evil did
a
great job overall and I can't wait to Resident Evil: Nemesis. - R.F.
