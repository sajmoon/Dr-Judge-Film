&quot;Resident Evil&quot; is one of the worst new movies I've watched this year.<br /><br />I got to admit that I'm not a big fan of &quot;the Matrix&quot;, I don't like the
story and I don't like the special effects with slow motion and people
running on the walls.<br /><br />The story in &quot;Resident Evil&quot; is a bit similar with computers taking control,
and the special effects have also been used. One of them is the bullet being
fired in slow motion - we have seen it before, and don't want to see it ever
again.<br /><br />I also think that the director has been inspired by &quot;Aliens&quot;, which is a
much better movie than &quot;Resident Evil&quot;. &quot;Aliens&quot; is a much more scary movie
than this poor movie, and you don't know when the situations will occur.
While watching &quot;Resident Evil&quot; you'll know whenever something will happen,
there is nothing unexpected throughout the whole movie.<br /><br />Do you like &quot;the Matrix&quot; you'll maybe also like this one. If you just want
to watch a movie where machines/computers take control, then you should
watch the Terminator-movies.<br /><br />My vote for &quot;Resident Evil&quot; was 3/10.
