This movie left me completley suprised.  I was waiting for a gamer movie to
once suck again as usual.  The special effects are incredible and the story
line is fantastic.  The screenplay could have been a little better but, you
get passed it with all the gore.  Not that much fighting in this one but,
wait til' the sequel part two has the best battles in it I LOVED IT<br /><br />8/of10
