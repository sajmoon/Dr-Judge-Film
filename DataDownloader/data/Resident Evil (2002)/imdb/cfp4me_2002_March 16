Initially I disliked the movie, but I went home and played through one of
the games and realized it wasn't so bad. If Paul Anderson decides to make a
sequel he had better put enough &quot;back tracking&quot; plot and story-line for
those who don't understand the deep rooted connotations of Umbrella Inc and
the entire game series in general. I was disappointed that George Romero
was
booted, but I am beginning to wonder how bad his version was if they
decided
to keep Andersen...
