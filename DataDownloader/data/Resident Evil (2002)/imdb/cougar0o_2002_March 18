I've played the game, and well this still didn't make sense.  First off i'd
just like to say that i had to look on this site to find out Milla
Jovovich's character's name.  I dont' think it was mentioned throughout the
entire movie.  The zombie's and graphics were ok, especially the
lickers(large mutated creatures), but it lacked a coherent plot and it
seemed to take forever to &quot;get started.&quot;  And I was expecting it to go on
when it ended.  The writer's once again left the movie wide open for future
sequels.  This is used to make extra money, but it really screws up the
first movie.  The extra long beginning and stupid ending made for a
confusing and frustrating trip to the theaters for me.
