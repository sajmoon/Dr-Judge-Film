I have said many times that games of any kind do not make good movies but
I
now have to make one exception when I say that. Resident Evil is a great
zombie shoot-em-up that doesn't rely entirely on visceral thrills. The
plot
has enough twists to keep things interesting and the characters are real
enough that you care about them. On top of all that Milla Jovanovich is a
treat to look at for a couple of hours and makes a convincing heroine.<br /><br />It is true that there is nothing very original in the movie but what it
steals it puts to good use. If I have a complaint it is that the movie
uses
the same schtick too many times. I'm talking about the trick of having
some
obvious source of danger that everyone thinks is about to happen NOT
happen
and instead some other unexpected nastiness happens. Good once, not 4
times.<br /><br />As long as you don't put it in the Gladiator class and instead expect a
thrilling Saturday night Drive in action movie this one is top of the
line.
