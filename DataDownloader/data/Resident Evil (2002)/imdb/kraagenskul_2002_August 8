After playing Resident Evil for the Game Cube, I decided to rent this
fiasco.  I realize that a movie cannot be the same as a video game, so I
didn't have that expectation.  The opening of the movie if very intriguing,
but once the assault team enters it the movie goes from bad to worse.  The
&quot;evil computer&quot; subplot is ridiculous, the fact that &quot;bullets don't seem to
stop them&quot; yet that is exactly how they stop them, and the entire virus
plot
is contrived.  The &quot;scary&quot; parts of the movie where you are supposed to
jump
are so obvious I didn't even blink.
I give this movie a 2 out of 10.
