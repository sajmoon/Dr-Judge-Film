It's a computer-game-to-movie-flick. They're always bad. Is this an
exception? Not really&#133; but it is a lot of fun. It entertains you for a
while
and there's something to be said for that.<br /><br />Plot? Does it matter? Everyone in a top-secret research base dies. A group
of elite marines are sent in to find out what happened. They're helped by
Alice (Milla Jovovich), who is suffering amnesia. There're are also two
other men suffering amnesias. As they womble along, they uncover the
shocking truths of what happened&#133; and the even more shocking truths of who
they themselves are&#133;So, as you can see, the plot's a load of garbage.
However it's kinda fun. Some lamented the fact the movie didn't opt for a
tongue-in-cheek approach of `Dog Soldiers'&#133; but I'm perfectly happy with
that. We've enough post-modernism now that a good-old fashioned zombie-fest
is welcome. Sure there are elements here which leave you thinking, `Why did
they do that?' but you can forgive it all because it's entertaining
you.<br /><br />Acting? While Michelle Rodriguez is good as action-gal Rain, the cast just
barely hold themselves. Sure the characters are as one-dimensional as their
video-game roots&#133; but what the heck. Seeing as how we know most of them are
going to be whittled away, this doesn't really matter to us. Since when did
a pure-horror movie have good acting?<br /><br />Directing? How does it gel? Paul Anderson&#133; does some stuff here. There's a
surprisingly decent amount of jump moments. Sure they are somewhat queued
in
advance, but they're still fairly effective. The hard-pumping metal
soundtrack also works well in a cheap sense. The usual
separate-the-characters routine works grand and no character is
particularly
neglected to any detrimental effect. The action sequences are good, with
enough tension and testosterone to make you smile. It's what we want &#150; a
brainless action-flick that's fun.<br /><br />It's by no means a great movie, or even a good movie. However it doesn't
have false pretensions about it's worth. It's entertainment, it's a `switch
off' brain moment. It's an enjoyable way to spend ninety or so minutes of
your life, and it had enough of that to make me see the sequel when it gets
released. 6.5/10.
