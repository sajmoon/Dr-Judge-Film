I have never been a fan of horror / zombie movies. In addition, even
once the generally poor quality of films computer games (Tomb Raider!),
I expected the worst when the sneak the title &#x22;Resident Evil&#x22; appeared.<br /><br />In retrospect, I must say that the film was not against me. Good: it is
a little thirteen-in-a-dozen in terms of action but overall surely not
badly made. The characters remain two-dimensional and very little
attention to relationships, the movie is certainly a next level.<br /><br />The zombies were simply laughable. I thought of Michael Jackson every
time &#x27;Cause this is thriller, thriller night / and no one is going to
save you from the beast about to strike.<br /><br />However, it was opposite that it is not tedious to Milla Jojovich half
hours in a short skirt around to see running. However, if you like this
movie then expects a sequel.
