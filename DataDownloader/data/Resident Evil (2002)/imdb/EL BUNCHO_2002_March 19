Here's the skinny: I am not a video game fan, so I went into this film with
only one thing on my mind-a gory zombie movie. Boy was I
disappointed!<br /><br />While watching the film, I came to a few conclusions. 1. I realized that I
have already seen DAWN OF THE DEAD, and it was a far superior film in every
way. 2. This is a zombie film that has an R rating and yet it has no worthy
gore to speak of. 3. There was no story. The upshot of which is that I
already saw DAWN OF THE DEAD but all of the good stuff was actually in that
movie. Since I had already seen a good version of the same basic scenario,
I
was prompted to do something that I haven't done in 15 years.<br /><br />I walked out.<br /><br />I have certainly seen worse films, but this is simply devoid of scares,
suspense and characters. People who may find this film to be actually scary
seriously need to hit the video rentals stores! And.please, PLEASE put an
end to the plague of video game adaptations!!! Don't keep shelling out your
hard-earned cash for this kind of crap; it only encourages Hollywood to
crank out more!
