Resident Evil was really nothing more than a HiTech version of Day Of The
Dead. It had basically exactly the same plot outline but less of the
effects:
A strange epidemic that turned humans into zombies was raging around a
city
turning everybody except a few lone survivors struggling to get away from
these creatures and find a cure.
That happens in Resident Evil aswell(The bit about the cure) but in
Resident
Evil:Nemisis, and happens through the course of the 'Of The Dead
trilogy.
But disregarding all that mumbojumbo, the film was pretty good. The
special
effects looked amazing like when the lazers sliced through the commando's
body's, the bits slide off.
Not a lot of swearing in it though, which I thought was a bit odd, because
you'd expect lots in a movie like this. But quite a bit of blood and gore,
which was good.
This film is a must see: No noticable goofs and a real good story
line.
