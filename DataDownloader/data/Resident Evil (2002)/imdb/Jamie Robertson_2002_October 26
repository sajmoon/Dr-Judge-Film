We have seen another explosion of Video games being made into movies again
lately, Final Fantasy, Dungeons and Dragons.
Now we are presented with the ultimate sci fi film.
&quot;Resident Evil&quot;<br /><br />And I have to say, out of all these types of movies, This Spin off has to
be
the one that stands out above the rest.
The VG was a popular and history in the making. The Movie, has filled in
the
gaps it's fans have wanted and wanted for a long time.<br /><br />The Music, Acting and Story is a complete masterpeice.
Some reviewers would disagree and claim it's poor. But working in a
Cinema,
I've heard some very good comments from our customers.
And to please our audience, is an acheivement it's self.<br /><br />The movie has started a whole new chapter to the Resident evil game
saga.
You've played and entertained. Now let this movie entertain
you.<br /><br />If you dislike it, think what your going to the cinema for. To moan or to
watch?<br /><br />A cracking film which I'd give a 9 out of 10<br /><br />~Jamie~
