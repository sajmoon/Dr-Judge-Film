This title is very good and the scenes are very real. I like it besides
the fact that the video game are much better. When i see it i really
scare about the zombies and the evil present in the dark ambient of
Raccoon City and The Hive. If you like the video game you perhaps
disappointing a little seeing the movie but... this is not enough to
call the film as horrible. The story is not all bad and the spirit of
the game was catched by the director. Maybe a little more stars at the
roster and a little more look in the direction of the real history and
then ....eureka! one of the greatest movies ever made was the result.
Truly impressive the beginning and the end. Definitely a very
entertaining movie and a wise choice.
