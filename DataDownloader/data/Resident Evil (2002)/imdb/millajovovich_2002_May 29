This show is great, automatic weapons, zombies, pretty girls, and the
like.
It's perfect, in the plot; I would say it matches the RE video game 4.5
out
of 5...<br /><br />Well, it's a plot that everyone should have known by reading all the other
posts, so there's no need for me to say great lengths here,
anyway.
