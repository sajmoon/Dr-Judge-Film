Really cool and I thought Stylish although the zombies could have been a
little more frightening.  I thought the story was pretty good too for a
video game based movie.  Some very cool scenes though and of course Milla
is
very easy on the eyes.  We had fun with this one I think if you are a
zombie
fan you will too.
