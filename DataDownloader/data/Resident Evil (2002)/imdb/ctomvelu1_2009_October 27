Who knew Paul Anderson had it in him? Well, the fact is, while by no
means a great director, he can certainly create mood and atmosphere, as
witness EVENT HORIZON. This adaptation of a popular video game has mood
and atmosphere to spare, as a top-secret lab experiment goes haywire
and soldiers are sent in to deal with the aftermath. Everybody&#x27;s
favorite Fifth Element, Milla Jovovich, is the heroine of the piece,
and is surrounded by a cast of mostly unknown actors evidently from
many different countries based on their potpourri of accents (the film
was shot overseas). Probably the best video game-derived movie to date,
as befits one the best video games ever made.
