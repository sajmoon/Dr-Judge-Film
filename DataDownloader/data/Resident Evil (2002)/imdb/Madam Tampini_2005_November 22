I thought it was AWESOME! Its kinda one of those movies where you
either have to hate it or love it. I loved it. Michelle Rodriguez (Rain
Ocampo) was awesome. Milla Jovovich (Alice) I think really did a good
job...they even did almost all of there stunts! Some of the Goofs
posted, you wouldn't know about unless you watched the commentary (I
did of course). A lot of the things are really unnoticeable. The
handwriting continuity was pretty bad though but I didn't realize it
until the second time I watched the movie. I didn't watch the
commentary until the 3rd time I rented it so I didn't know about the
floor flexing in the elevator scene until I watched the commentary...I
really liked how the director didn't shove the zombies in your face
until like half-way through the movie. One of the reasons I really
liked the movie was BECAUSE they didn't find out how to kill the undead
until the Red-Queen chamber scene. I didn't enjoy the second one
(Resident Evil: Apocalypse) BECAUSE they already knew how to kill them
and it wasn't as much of the learning curve as in the first one. I
really enjoyed this movie and I plan to get it for X-mas... Yes I loved
it that much!
