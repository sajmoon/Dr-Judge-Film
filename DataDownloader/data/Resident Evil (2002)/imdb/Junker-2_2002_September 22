&quot;Resident Evil&quot; follows the all too familiar path of a couple other recent
movies: &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn&quot; and &quot;The Ghosts of Mars.&quot; All three start with
an interesting plot but end up just being about zombies instead. (Or
vampires. Or whatever.) It's as if in all three cases the writers got bored
halfway through and said &quot;Oh, heck. Let's just throw in some zombies.&quot;  (Or
vampires. Or whatever.)<br /><br />I don't mean to suggest that &quot;Resident Evil&quot; is terrible. It's okay. But the
frustrating thing is that, like those other two movies, it could have been
so much more.<br /><br />In fact, the initial plot is rather intriguing: We are set in a secret,
underground facility where biological weapons are being created. But
something has gone seriously wrong and the computer that controls the
facility has started killing off the people who work there. Now an outside
team must penetrate the facilities defenses and attempt to take control of
the situation.<br /><br />And then...! And then...! Zombies!<br /><br />Milla Jovovich stars as a helpless female who needs protecting at first but
soon becomes a tough chick with moves that would do Jackie Chan proud. Okay,
her transformation is explained by a memory loss that is slowly regained,
but it seems the producers wanted it both ways: Helpless and tough at the
same time. Michelle Rodriguez is at least consistently the tough chick
throughout. But her constant &quot;I'm tough, get out of my way&quot; routine gets old
quickly.<br /><br />In fact, it is interesting that Rodriguez is second billed in this movie.
This seems to be the case only because there was no one else to give second
billing to. The male characters are all poorly drawn and very difficult to
keep track of. I kept forgetting which one was supposed to be the bad
guy.<br /><br />Sure, some of the action sequences will keep your interest. Milla's battle
with some zombie dogs make the movie worth giving a chance if you have
nothing better to do some evening. Still, the next time I decide to watch a
zombie movie I think I will pick one that is a zombie movie all the way, and
not one where the zombies were thrown in because the writers got bored.
