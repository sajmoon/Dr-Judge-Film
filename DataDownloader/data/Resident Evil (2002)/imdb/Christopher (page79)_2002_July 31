2002_July 31 

I was very disappointed with this film. Paul Anderson has directed<br /><br />some great films. I loved Mortal Combat. Thought Event Horizon<br /><br />was a fantastic film ,(except the ending. I hate it when the explain<br /><br />everything, better to let the audience come to there own<br /><br />conclusions.) and was thrilled with Soldier. All of these film I beg<br /><br />you to watch! This one however, ..second to all of the above. I dont<br /><br />really blame Anderson. I think the material he had to work with is a<br /><br />bit dull. Flesh eating zombies was a cool idea ONCE. Continually<br /><br />hitting that dead horse(no pun intended) has become very boring<br /><br />for the viewers. Anderson managed to get all you can from<br /><br />Jovovich. The other actors fell under the old Star Trek philosophy,<br /><br />(If you aint seen 'em before, there going to die, has anyone else<br /><br />EVER seen these people in ANYTHING?) so I guess flushing out<br /><br />there characters would of been a waste of time. 
All and all Resident Evil was just a 90 minute lead in to the
sequel.
I've got my fingers crossed that Anderson can write and direct<br /><br />himself out of this corner and provide his fans with a reason to see<br /><br />his next non-Resident Evil film.
