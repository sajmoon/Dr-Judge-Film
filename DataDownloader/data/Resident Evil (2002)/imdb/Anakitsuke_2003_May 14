First of all, people have to realize that not all Video games are stupid.<br /><br />&quot;Resident Evil&quot; (the game) had a very interesting and atmospheric story,
with believable characters and an exciting plot. The Movie however,
distorted EVERYTHING into a cheap sci-fi movie.<br /><br />Had they chosen the same setting as the game, the movie would've been
better
AND cheaper (as they wouldn't have to use all the cheap cgi/sci-fi
stuff)<br /><br />Don't blame Video games and their stories (which are interesting in many
cases) for the work of sub-par Directors such as Paul Anderson (which
quite
frankly, I still don't know how people let this guy make
movies).<br /><br />As soon as Hollywood start taking a serious approach to Video game
Material,
as it did in &quot;X-Men&quot;, we will see a wave of good Video game-Inspired
films,
and as long as the Directors and Crew are competent, we'll be in for a
treat.
