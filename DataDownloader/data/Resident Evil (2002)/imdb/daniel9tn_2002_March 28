Damn, this film really disappointed me, even though I didn`t expect much.
The only things worth been seen are Michelle Rodriguez&acute;s
in-your-face-attitude and Mila&acute;s gorgeous dress.<br /><br />The movie was a sequence of almost isolated scenes, at no time able to
captivate and thus not creating ANY suspense at all. I felt like the
director had wanted to just &quot;mention&quot; every character of the game. Zombies,
dogs, etc. all showed up for some minutes contributing no forthtaking
effect
to the plot. Bad publicity for the computer-game and, most of all Paul
Anderson.
Less could have been more for this one. Resident Evil had the
possibility to become an entertaining pop-shocker. Unfortunately it turned
out to be not only a bad game-adaption, but a really worthless piece of
crap, one of the worst pictures I&acute;ve seen so far. Sorry folks...
