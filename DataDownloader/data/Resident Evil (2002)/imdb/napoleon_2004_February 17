You just can't take your eyes off MJ during this movie and the sometimes
weak script and sloppy plotting is tied together by her sheer on screen
charisma. Anderson  is much underrated as a director, moving things along
with pace if not necessarily scares. All is forgiven for Soldier.
Almost.<br /><br />8/10
