this movie rocked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it is such an awesome movie. its
scary, suspenseful, well-acted and had good action sequences. actually the
action scenes were awesome. and the two lead actresses are both awesome.
especially Michelle Rodriguez but Milla Jovovich was good to. this was way
better than mortal kombat 2 and should do some good for Pauls career i
cant
wait for the second one man it is gonna be soooooooo awwsome 9.5/10 go see
this it will be well worth your while
