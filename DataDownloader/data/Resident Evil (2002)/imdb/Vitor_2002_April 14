This movie succeeds in two of the hardest tasks out there: To make a good
action movie AND to make a good movie out of a video-game. Fast, modern
and
very well directed, Resident Evil is fun and smart. It&acute;s no masterpiece,
of
course, since it&acute;s focused on action and adventure. Therefore, it presents
a
convincing and unpredictable plot, what&acute;s indeed rare in this genre. Milla
Jovovich is great as an action actress. Perhaps she finally found her
ground
in movie-making. I am also expecting a sequel, and I believe there is
going
to be one.<br /><br />7/10 in general
9/10 as an action movie
