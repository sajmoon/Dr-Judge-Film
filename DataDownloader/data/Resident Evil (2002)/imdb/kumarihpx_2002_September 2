2002_September 2 

Well, first off, the movie was ... well, yawn.  I actually was fighting
sleep watching this one late at night with my little brother, even though
it
is supposed to be an action film.  Some call it horror (wrong), sci-fi
(um,
maybe).  I can't believe how uninvolved I was in the movie; plus, the plot
was incoherent -- if there was one really.<br /><br />That being said, one of the coolest ways to die: being cut into bits by a
killer laser run by a computer which is set on High Defense with an evil
child alter ego.  Now, that's the way I'd like to go.  It's just too
outstanding and sinister to not comment on this.<br /><br />The commentary by the creators and actors:  by far, one of the funniest
things I have ever heard in my life.  Basically, it's these two quite dry
British guys (director and producer) trying to make some noteworthy
comments
on the making of the film, with the two girls (Milla and Michelle) making
fun of them, laughing uproarously,  and telling fart jokes.  Milla was the
silliest of all, but totally hilarious.  From the beginning, she starts
off
doing impersonations and voices, then brushes aside one of the first
comments on the grading of the colors in the flashbacks by the director by
saying, basically: Who cares about that?  No one is going to care about
the
grading... Did everyone just see my nipple shot?!  Haha!  Also,  I should
note (maybe it will help them make more money and sell more DVDs), the
girls
mention several times throughout the commentary how hot they think each
other are.  Both of them have a laughter and demeanor that is so
infectious
you can't help (sometimes despite yourself) but laugh right along with
them
and just have a great time.  Highly recommended commentary.<br /><br />Just average movie: 5/10.<br /><br />
