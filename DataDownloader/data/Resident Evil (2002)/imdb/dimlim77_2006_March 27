The first thing to remember here is that this movie was a very popular
video game and therefore the first thing that a viewer should look for
is the similarity to that game. Personally, I do not understand anyone
going to see this without at least some knowledge of the game. Having
said all that, this movie was almost perfect in relating to the game.<br /><br />This movie had the same locations as the game, the exact same story and
all the right characters that made the game so interesting. The action
was good from the beginning to end and the only reason I did not vote
the movie a 10 on 10 (based on rating previous VG movies) was that it
suffered from the stereotypically not so perfect acting. Let's face it,
it usually sucks in these types of movies. <br /><br />I know that this review might seem empty but the truth is that there is
not much to say. The music fits perfectly, the casting was right for
the movie (even if their acting was not perfect) and it stayed true to
the original. My only advice is to stay away if you don't know about
Resident Evil because that may cause you to have a lesser opinion of a
movie that does exactly what it is supposed to.
