Reading through the other reviews I noticed that everybody was expecting
something different. No, Resident Evil is not original - in fact, it's
pretty corny. Acting, story and special effects are not worth any awards
and
it's not a complete splatter-festival either.<br /><br />But for some sick reason I've always enjoyed horror movies and of course
prefer to see them on the big screen. And for that reason I went to see
Resident Evil and wasn't disappointed - it's what I had hoped for, nothing
more and nothing less.<br /><br />I'd rate Paul Anderson's last movie Event Horizon slightly higher, since
I'm
especially a sucker for SciFi/Horror and apart from Alien there's not much
on the market to shout about, with Event Horizon being a reasonable
effort.
Still, Resident Evil is fine for what it is.
