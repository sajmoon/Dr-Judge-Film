Resident Evil: One Of The Coolest Movies I've Seen...Maybe I'm A nerd But
I've Seen It 13 Times And I'm Watching It a 14th As I Type. &quot;There may be
survivors. Give me a search line but keep it tight.&quot; I Bought The DVD The
Day It Came Out And Made All My Friends Who Havent Seen It Watch It. They
All Agree With Me That It Is A Really Really Cool Movie. And Even If
You've
Played The Game You Will Still Wanna Watch The Movie Because, While
Sticking
With The Same Basic Concept, They Streched The Story Line A Bit. And They
Did Such A Good Job With The Filming You'd Never Belive That It Was A
Pretty
Low-Budget Film...I Totally Recommend This Movie!
