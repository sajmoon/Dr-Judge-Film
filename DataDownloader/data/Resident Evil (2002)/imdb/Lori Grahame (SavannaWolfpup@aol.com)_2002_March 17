This movie is sapossed to be about the game.
One thing is, is the zombies were a whole lot scarier in the game then they
were on the &quot;silver screen.&quot; The &quot;licker&quot; didn't arrive in the game until
the second one, but they sure did leave out the big guy that JILL was to
fight, the Tyrent . . . Does anyone remember him? I sure
do.
Where were S.T.A.R.S. Alpha and Bravo Team? Where was Jill, Berry, Chris,
Wesker, Brad, Kenneth, Enrico, Rebecca, and Richard? And where was all of
the weapons? It wasn't Racoon City, that doesn't come up until the second
and the third one, it is set in Racoon Forest. I would think that if George
A. Romero (Dawn of the Dead) did the movie it would would have been a lot
better. At least when they did Tomb Raider it stayed with the game. I'm
sorry, if your going to take something and redo it, do it
right!
