Quite an entertaining movie but the fans of the game may find it
disappointing as this doesn&#x27;t necessarily stick to the games. In fact,
the things that this movie and the games have in common is the T-Virus,
zombies, the monsters and Umbrella, not the story. The story wasn&#x27;t so
well-thought but W.S Anderson&#x27;s twist on the Resident Evil universe
works to an extent. While trying to make the movie his own, it felt
like it was driving away from the Resident Evil universe and started
being its own movie (which isn&#x27;t really such a bad thing). The music
added the tension and added more &#x27;oomph&#x27; to the action scenes which fit
the movie quite well. &#x27;Resident Evil&#x27; didn&#x27;t exactly have you waiting
for more but at the same time, it didn&#x27;t make you turn it off. There
were two or three scenes that were kind of boring and pointless but
other scenes were well-executed.<br /><br />One thing I couldn&#x27;t really fault was the acting for some of the
actors. Milla Jovovich being the star of the movie and Michelle
Rodriguez following close-second were brilliant. Their on-screen
&#x27;friendship&#x27; made it entertaining to watch and also the scenes between
Milla Jovovich as Alice and Eric Mabius as Matt was also good. I
couldn&#x27;t say much for the others like Colin Salmon and Martin Crewes
who were just average. The special effects and make-up in the movie
were done brilliantly and added such a dark and cold tone. The design
of the monsters were done well as were the make-up for the zombies.<br /><br />The movie ended quite well and wasn&#x27;t exactly predictable like some of
the scenes in the movie was. The ending wasn&#x27;t exactly so shocking that
you would remember it but for a movie that was above average, it ended
well and it felt like it went smoothly with the movie.<br /><br />Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com
