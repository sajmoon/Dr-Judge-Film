This movie has it all; if you like flesh-eating zombies, horror, guns,
secrets -characters with amnesia and stuff, powerful monsters, and/or the
game; you're gonna love this one.  I did!  But if all that I just mentioned
isn't enough, see it for the performance of Milla Jojovich, alone.  As you
may have guessed I'm a fan.  I've not necessarily liked all the movies she
was in, but her performances are everything I look for in a great female
character.  Pretty and pretty strange!!  I don't know, she just always makes
the movie, for me.<br /><br />This movie had more than that, though.  Great graphics and plot.  Cool
characters and acting.  Eerie atmosphere without too much dream-like
strangeness.  It had just the right mixture of everything.<br /><br />8/10 - I've seen better; but not much.<br /><br />thank you
