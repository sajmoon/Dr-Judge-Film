The only reason for me to see this movie was the mansion used as the secret
entrance to the Hive. The original location happens to be next door to my
home. I wasn't really expecting anything good from a video game conversion,
but it was surprisingly entertaining and frightening, definitely worth the
admittance. Though, the mechanisms used to shock the audience appeared a
little off-the-shelf.
