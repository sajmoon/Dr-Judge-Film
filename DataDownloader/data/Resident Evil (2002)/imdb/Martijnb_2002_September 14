Not a very original movie, I mean, come on, a story which involves zombies
and an all knowing and controlling computer? Add this to a serious amount
of
overacting, lousy special effects and Blade-wannabe music, and you'll have
a
good impression of this movie.<br /><br />When you watch this movie in a cinema, you are still wondering about the
plot or story long after the break has passed.<br /><br />When I have to say anything positive about this movie it would be: I'd
like
to get me one of those laser cutter things to create impressive potato
shapes!<br /><br />Don't spend your money on this one...
