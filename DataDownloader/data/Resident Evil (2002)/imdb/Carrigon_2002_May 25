I really liked this movie.  I'm usually a horror movie snob and hate
anything new.  But this one was very good.  Milla was great, I would love to
see her in more roles like this one.  I thought the script stayed very true
to alot of the gameplot.  And the movie definitely had some creepy moments. 
I was very sorry they didn't show more of the mansion, I would have loved to
have seen more of it.  It's an amazing property.  And while the makeup
wasn't like Tom Savini's work, it was still very good.  When I heard Romero
wasn't going to be doing this project, I really was prepared to hate it, but
I think Paul Anderson did a wonderful job on it.  And he set up the ending
very well for the sequel, which I think will be even better.  If you're a
fan of the games, this movie is worth watching.  I was never bored, it kept
up a nice pace.
