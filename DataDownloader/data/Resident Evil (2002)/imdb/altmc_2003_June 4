I seen the movie, It's ok.<br /><br />Let's face it. Some of us might liked the movie and Some of us think it's
gross or other of us think it great. In might opinion that they were doing
the computer to much of the time. But sometime the producer's want to use
the special computer to make us swe for their so-called ( great work ) but
spend to much money on it.<br /><br />Special Effect was been using in ALOT ALOT ALOT of movie's and we seen
most
of it now-a-days. now tell me this, How come we never seen one simple
movie
that has no computer special effect to show us ?<br /><br />why ?    It's simple.<br /><br />People loved the special effects in the movie's. It make them more future
people than in the morden day world. The production or producer's want the
people believed that this is their fanstay and they can either save the
world or get kill. But some people will think it's just plain old movie to
scare us ot make us laugh.<br /><br />personally I think they production,producer's, HOLLYWOOD or watever spend
way too much money on special effect to impress their so-called ( great
work
) and use it to for the movie that has no special effect.<br /><br />try drama, they have few special effect and few don't have it. that the
way
I like it ALOT ALOT ALOT ALOT.<br /><br />Thanks.
