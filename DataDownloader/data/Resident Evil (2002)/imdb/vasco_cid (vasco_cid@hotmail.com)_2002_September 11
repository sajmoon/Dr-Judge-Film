As common knowledge has it, Resident Evil is based on a computer game from
the same name, which, due to its success, and Hollywood's last fashion of
bringing to the big screen wether it is computer games or comic-book heroes,
Was brought by competent director Paul W.S. Anderson into a gore filled
film.
As I stated before two probable reasons stand to explain why the computer
game was transformed into a movie: First, as Resident Evil was one of the
most profitable computer games ever, a movie adaptation wouldn't take very
long. Second as lately many computer games (Mortal Combat) or Comic book
heroes have a movie adaptation (X Men; Spider Man), Resident Evil - The
Movie should be coming any time now.
Frankly, I've never played the game before, although I've knowledge of it,
which is why I know how the main story goes. Perhaps what is more noticeable
is the sense of claustrofobia that not only the actors, but the viewer feel
2km underground.
When we get into a movie like this, we already know, we're not going to see
some masterpiece, the screenplay will not be something amazingly deep, but
one can tell that was never the intention of the producers. Their intention
was undoubtfully to suck the viewers in, make them jump, scream, sweat
tremble, laugh and become frightned. If that was the intention,
congratulations, you made it. Kudos, mainly to the Director. If the
intention was some underlined one, like character development or story's
depth, they failed. But as the intention was the first one, then Resident
Evil, is one of the most enjoyable and job fulfilling movies
recently.
The cast is not exacly big stars, with the exception of Milla Jovovich, but
that doesn't matter all that much because the movie was an enormous success,
mainly because of the talent of increasingly rising young stars, like
Michelle Rodriguez, James Purefoy and Eric Mabius.
Finaly, what probabily shocked people the most was the completely opened
end. That doesn't mean anything else than &quot;sequel next
year&quot;.
B-movie? Yes. Funny? Sure Enjoying? Definetly!
