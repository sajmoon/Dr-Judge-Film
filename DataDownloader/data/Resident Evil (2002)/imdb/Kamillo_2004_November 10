Oh the truth is that I could watch this movie, and watch it for hours.
In my opinion it is the best movie adaptation of a video game that has
been made so far. <br /><br />I like all of Paul Anderson's movies (Event Horizon was great!) but
Resident Evil is his best one. The scene with cutting lasers was so
amazing that I had to go to the cinema twice to see it. Acting was
great as well. I liked Michelle Rodriguez as Rain most. <br /><br />The sequel however, was not so good. It wasn't bad but lost the climate
of the first part. For me it was not a horror but rather a silly action
movie. I hope that Paul Anderson will direct the third part.
