I saw a preview of RE yesterday and was not disappointed.
I am a big fan of the video games, especially the first one, and like many
of the gamers, I was shocked by the &quot;Supercomputer&quot; story. I would have
loved the plot of RE being done in a movie, but well, you can't have it
all.<br /><br />Also, the gore just was not enough. It is Rated R, but still not close to
the game's great splatter effects. It's freakin Resident
Evil!<br /><br />Aside from these two points I loved this movie, and I don't say this very
often about a movie. It's fast and loud, a thrill ride from the beginning
till the end (pretty much as scary as Event Horizon which I liked) and
plenty of gun fights. The story is, while not the same as RE 1 (the game)
at
about the same level quality wise. The aspect I loved the most was Marilyn
Manson's score. I love his music and he did a great job on this movie with
a
rather industrial, but still loud and freaky approach. The effects are
good,
I thought the Zombies looked just like they did in the game, and that's
what
I expected. The action scenes are nicely done, the only things I didn't
like
were the two &quot;Matrix-type&quot; scenes you can see in the trailers (bullet time
&amp;
wall walk).<br /><br />I was deeply satisfied when I walked out of the cinema into the cold night
and I expect you will be too if you liked the game.<br /><br />Oh btw, did I mention Milla is just beautiful?<br /><br />9/10 (closer to the game would have been a ten)
