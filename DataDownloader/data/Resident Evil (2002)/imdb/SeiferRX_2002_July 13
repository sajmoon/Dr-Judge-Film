Resident Evil is a great movie and it even adds to the plot of the game
series. The movie answers many questions that weren't answered in the games
and is like a prequel to the first game, showing how the T-Virus escaped
into the underground lab in the first place.  It also has plenty of action
throughout the game and will make you jump in your seat atleast
once.
