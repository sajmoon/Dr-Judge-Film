Though Romero was nowhere to be found in the finally film, his archetypes
were.  This visually stunning, claustrophobic piece brings the video game to
life in a way rarely, if ever, seen before.  Moments of zombie-ridden
calamity scream references to moments established in Romero's 'Dead' films,
and leave the horror fanatic drooling with delight.  Aside from some
occasional bad dialogue, a constantly brooding Michelle Rodriguez and that
ever present curse of finding good zombies to act in a film, it was a
stunning work of horror.  The zombie-loving public never gets a fair shake
in the mainstream of Hollywood, so this is a must see if only for the
moments that glimmer references to Romero-past.
