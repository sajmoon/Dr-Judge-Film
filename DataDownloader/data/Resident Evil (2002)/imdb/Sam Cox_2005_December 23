I went to the cinema having high expectations for the film. I was and
still am a huge fan oft he games, especially Resi 2. I was expecting
the characteristics of the game to be int he film; gore, suspense,
violence, zombies and some nasty monsters. I was in for a huge
disappointment...<br /><br />The film starts off OK, with some unknown figure unleashing the T-Virus
but then it goes circling out of control. Whereas there are some
elements still retained from the game(laboratory is under a mansion
outside Racoon City and is owned by Umbrella Corporation it seems that
the director got bored of transferring the franchise to film, and
instead made the rest up. What follows is a mindless adventure as some
elite soldiers go through the underground lab to try and stop the
threat of the virus. Of course, there are zombies, but the overall look
of then pales in comparison to Dawn Of The Dead (2004). Whereas some of
them have gruesome wounds, 80% of them are just very pale and have
makeup and fake blood. Along with that, there is no suspense. And what
happens is that a zombie(s)will emerge, and along with tons of
shooting, rock music appears.<br /><br />The big bad boy boss monster is the licker, who most Resi fans will
know and appreciate as a med-i-okre monster, not too challenging. This
thing however is made out to be the mother of all creations and is very
disappointingly realised with bad CGI. There is no suspense here, a
total lack of blood and gore, and only one monster. True fans of the
Resi games will be and should be disappointed.<br /><br />That said, their are a few things which raise Resi from the dead (sorry
for the pun). The ending climactic train set piece is enjoyable and
fast paced, and the laser hallway (imagine, 3 soldiers, trapped in a
hallway, with lasers that chop things in half) is pretty neat. There's
also a cool appearance by some zombie Doberman dogs, however they're
quickly killed off in a silly action scene.<br /><br />This film could have been so much more if the director would have
ditched the possibility for &quot;cool stunts&quot; and gone for more style,
suspense and horror. Even when the heroes are outnumbered and
surrounded by zombies, you never feel as if they are in THAT much
danger....when in a situation like that you should be on the edge of
your seat.<br /><br />For zombie lovers, there are better choices out there. George A
Romero's Dead films, the remake of Dawn of The Dead (04, Saun Of The
Dead and even 28 Days Later serve up better chills and scares than this
med-i-okre action fest.
