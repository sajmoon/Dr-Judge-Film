Most video game turned movies turn out terrible. Often times, even worse
than that. Here however, it actually turns out alright. Why? Because
instead
of taking ever bit of the game titles and throwing it into a movie that
appeals (and makes sense) only to fanboys, Resident Evil stands well on
its
own as a horror/suspense movie. To be fair, the acting is pretty stiff.
Shakespeare its not. However, it definitely has its share of scares and
times when stuff just pops up. The plot is surprising well put together,
the
music creepy, the zombies (this is a zombie movie in the vein of Evil
Dead)well done. Basically, the bottom line is, if you want to go see a
classic horror movie redone with Milla Jovovich then its a great movie to
see. Its plain and simple fun.
