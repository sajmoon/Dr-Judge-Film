2002_November 30 

I had been anticipating the movie Resident Evil since I heard to was to be
released back in 1998. At the time there were various directors and
writers
attached to the project, even George A. Romero -- The Master of Zombie
Flicks. However, if you read Romero's script which appeared online, most
would agree it was a quite corny script that had no real
development.<br /><br />So finally I heard in 2001 that Paul Anderson, who directed Mortal Kombat
(and did a good job at that) would write/direct the project. And it was
finally released March 2002. So here are my thoughts on the flick. His
ideas
for cutting away from the game by introducing a new story was a good
idea...
to leave some surprises for the gamers and non-gamers. However there were
many problems in his script. The story is good because it keeps close to
the
idea of the corrupt Umbrella Corporation. However, character development
and
dialogue are the two biggest things wrong with the movie. Though the cast
is
minimal, there are only two interesting characters in the entire film.
Milla
Jovovich plays the mysterious &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; character who can't
remember her identity. As the movie progresses, we learn more about her
character, but never the entire thing (I'm sure it'll be answered in the
sequel). However the problem with Jovovich's character is though she's
mysterious, she's not very interesting. The only other character in the
film
that was interesting was One (played by Colin Salmon). Colin Salmon kicks
ass as the elite group's leader. His dialogue is very well written, too.
He
basically explains the entire situation of what has happened, which is
good
because Salmon has a great, bold voice. It's very unfortunate that this
movie follows all the other roots of 'horror' flicks and kills off the
token
black character early. So before we can even embrace Salmon's character,
he
is dead (an incidentally, dies in the sickest &amp; coolest way
possible).<br /><br />So with only one really interesting character who doesn't last long and
another who isn't quite as interesting, this movie drags. However there is
enough action-packed sequences in it to keep one entertained.<br /><br />OVERALL: 6 out of 10 (okay)
