<br /><br />I'd have to say that Resident Evil is one of the few video game movies I
have ever been at least moderately entertained by. I didn't think it was a
good movie, but it was an entertaining mindless romp of zombie killing
fun.<br /><br />Sure the script is weak, the acting is horrible, and the direction is
needlessly formulaic, but hey it still is kind of fun to watch. Watching
the
movie is similar to playing through one of the video games, and that's all
you should take it as. I can understand why most people and critics didn't
like it. But I went to this movie expecting a mindless zombie killing
adventure, that's exactly what I got.<br /><br />For fans of the game series, the movie provides some interesting back
story.
It probably could have been about 20 times better if Romero would have
directed it, but I heard that he was straying heavily from the Resident
Evil
plot line already established in the games. Oh well, I guess we'll have to
wait for the Night of the Living Dead 4.<br /><br />Anyway, I give it ** out of **** stars...
