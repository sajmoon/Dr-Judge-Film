I really enjoyed this movie.  I liked that they didn't take one of the
games
and turn it into an adaptation.  I think Paul WS Anderson did a great job
and I am anticipating Nemesis.  Everything about it was done excellently:
special effect, cast, storyline, everything.  I recommend this movie to
everyone not just the die hard video game series.
Awesome movie!
