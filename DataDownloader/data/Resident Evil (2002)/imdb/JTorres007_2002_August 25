Just so you know, if you've played the RE game. This movie is not even
close
to an adaptation of it. The characters were completely different (no Jill,
etc.). Almost no zombies, demon dogs, slugs, etc. The acting was crappy
and
the soundtrack was even worse. I hate to read comments from kids who say
the
loved the game and rate this movie as &quot;cool&quot;, &quot;a great movie&quot; etc. Kids,
if
you really love the game at least do some justice to it. The movie had
nothing to do with the story. All they did was film a movie whatever the
way
they wanted it and said to themselves &quot;let's make some money out of these
dumb video game lovers and stick the name of RE in it!&quot;. I have played the
games several times and I still get goosebumps when some creature jumps on
my character. The scenes on the mansion really are creepy and the
soundtrack
really complements the atmosphere in the game. Not To mention in RE
Nemesis,
I freak out every time he comes out saying &quot;Star!&quot;, I just run as fast as
I
can out of there. This was supposed to be the way that this movie
should've
made me feel. Instead, it was just some b-rated zombie movie with almost
no
zombies in it and some &quot;actors&quot; that don't have a clue as to what are they
suppose to act in the film. Kids, wake up and come down to Earth when
rating
movies. Just don't go around saying &quot;it was so cool!&quot; kind of thing. I
have
no idea why they have to change the story so much when taking comic book
characters from the books to the screen. If it isn't broken don't try to
fix
it. Stick to the story and it will work.
