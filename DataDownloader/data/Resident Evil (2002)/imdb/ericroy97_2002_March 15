2002_March 15 

Given that this is based on a video game, maybe people weren't
expecting much, but that doesn't mean the entire film had to be a
loud overblown compendium of cliches drawn from other sources
like George Romero (homage or rip-off?  You be the judge) to the
tired Matrix styled shots of bullets cutting air.   Milla kicks some
butt, despite her wooden performance and Michelle Rodriguez just
scowls a lot, in between the 4th grade-school dialogue she and
the others are given.   Some nice action sequences and some
suspenseful moments (often ruined from the deafening sound
effects and the accompanying ambient techno/industrial
soundtrack)  Despite its flaws, it still remains passable, mindless
entertainment.  Bloody (not enough though), violent and slick  and
a must for fans of the games; others will probably find little
pleasure.  Unfortunately it could have been so much more. Oh,
and pack your ear plugs...
