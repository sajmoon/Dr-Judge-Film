This movie rips off &quot;Aliens&quot; is so many ways that James Cameron should
consider calling his lawyers. While the producers of &quot;Aliens&quot; successfully
pulled off a techno-thriller paramilitary action flick trapped in a monster
movie, Paul W.S. Anderson just chooses to crank up the music and turn on
the
blood spigot instead of delivering actual thrills or story. The script is a
joke, and the zombies just aren't scary at all.<br /><br />Blah. What a waste of Milla.
