Although I've played, and enjoyed, one of the games (RE2), I didn't
really fancy this movie, certainly didn't make the effort to see it at
the cinema, but a friend offered the DVD to lend...<br /><br />This is a superb bit of fun; I'm not sure what was in the first game,
but the memory loss idea is great: you don't know who the good guys
are, and who the bad guys are until about half way through, and the
fact that they don't know either adds real suspense.<br /><br />Certain scenes reveal their game origins; there's a scene with some
zombie dogs that is both chillingly atmospheric (like RE2 was), and
exciting, as the situation keeps getting worse every time you think
it's over! The pace never really lags, and yet it's not overwhelming.<br /><br />I can't really fault the acting, given that this is an action movie
with not much scope for performance; no-one is wooden, and everyone
seems to be fully 'into' their role.<br /><br />The special effects are convincing, the zombies look great, and the CGI
effects still stand up, given that this is now a 3-year old film. And,
of course, Milla looks great, especially when she's kicking zombie
head! In summary, if you like zombie movies, like good-looking female
action heroes, and want some not-too-mindless escapism with a few
little twists to keep it interesting, you'll love this movie.
