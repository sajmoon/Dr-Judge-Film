excellent acting one of which i think this has to be milla jovovich's best
performance to date. Good storyline based on the resident evil
games,brilliant effects and brilliant acting. The only thing that let it
down was a very bad sound operator that had trouble controlling his out of
control microphone. So please if they or when they make a sequel shoot him
first.
