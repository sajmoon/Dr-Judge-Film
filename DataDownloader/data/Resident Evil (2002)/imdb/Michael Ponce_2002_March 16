I've been waiting for this movie for years, and I'm glad that it was true
to
the game and worthy for RE fans all over the globe. I've played every game
(except Gun Survivor) and I probably speak for everyone when I say that
the
first time you played a Resident Evil game, there were parts that scared
the
crap out of you (try in surround sound and you'll see what I mean). This
movie has the same effect. I don't want to give away the plot (it's pretty
obvious), but there were special effects in the movie that were as gory as
they were awesome (the elevator, the laser room, the hives 'city
simulator'). Milla Jovovich (The Fifth Element) plays the perfect role of
the games 'Attractive heroine who kicks zombie butt'. I can't express how
typical this movie is of the RE genre (That expression being a very good
thing). The ending follows closely to the opening of the game Resident
Evil:2, and anyone who saw the ending and didn't understand it, just watch
the opening sequence in the video game to get a really awesome, graphic
explanation. 9 out of 10 for being such a good game-to-movie.
