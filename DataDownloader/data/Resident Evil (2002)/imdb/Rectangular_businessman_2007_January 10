I&#39;m writing this review just to comment that I don&#39;t agree with all the
comments that say that it was one of the best adaptations of a game
into a movie . What is more ,I think that I didn&#39;t make any justice to
the games. First of all ,I liked the games ,but it seems that Paul W.S.
Anderson (&quot;Morta&ntilde;l Kombat &quot; ) doesn&#39;t know very much about the game
except that the enemies were zombies . <br /><br />First ,the game have a dark and thrilling atmosphere ,while the movie
prefers to replace it with a scenery closer to a sci - fi movie,being
noisy and pompous about monsters ,like &quot;Alien &quot; with some good effects
,but isn&#39;t very thrilling . <br /><br />Second ,it have many irrelevant character that just appear to die one
by one ,and that &#39;s nothing original . <br /><br />I guess that the movie gives more importance to the visual aspect (
that doesn&#39;t have many similarities with the game ) but in general
lines it&#39;s a empty and irrelevant movie that have too many elements in
common with many other movies . But it isn&#39;t a accurate adaptation of
the game . the good things : the cast was great . Milla Jovovich is
perfect as Alice ,the heroine . The same is for Michelle Rodr&igrave;guez
,even when she made a pathetic character that just appear to die . And
some effects were good . But that isn&#39;t enough to make better this
movie .
