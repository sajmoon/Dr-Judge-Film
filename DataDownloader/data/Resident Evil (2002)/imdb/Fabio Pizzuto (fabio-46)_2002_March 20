I do not know if you have ever played the Game by Capcom. If you did so,
you
will probably find this movie terrible!
The horror and panic atmosphere in the movie is just a faint idea of what
the video game is and the inappropriate sound-track spoils all the scary
scenes. It looks like this movie has been done in a rush. This movie is
miles away to be a horror movie!
