  If you go to see resident evil- go and see it because you want to have
fun. Don't take it too seriously. It has some good special effects and quite
a few moments that will make you jump- if not scream.<br /><br />  My husband and I took my teenage son, and I was pretty skeptical about
liking it. But really,- when is the last time you went to the theatre to see
a zombie flick? It brought back memories!This movie is NOT for the pre teen
or younger set- a young mother chose to bring her little girl- probably 4 or
5 years old - and the child was very frightened. The R rating is appropriate
and parents should be aware.<br /><br />    The down note of the film is Michelle Rodreguiz's performance. She tried
too hard to be tough- I found it annoying. The rest of the cast was pretty
good.<br /><br /> Go ahead and see the movie- if you liked the video game, or just want to
see a good zombie flick.
