My word of advice for Milla, drop the Crouching Tiger flying slow-mo kicks
and commit the next flick to realism. As a self-confessed Resident Evil's
fan, she didn't stay true to the game, although the atmosphere is almost
there.<br /><br />The music was wrong, the characters got killed up too quickly and I only
wished they had the original Japanese game developers, to develop the story.
The original Bio-Hazard game (the original Japanese game) was just perfect
in everything in a movie sense. The suspense, the atmosphere, sound, etc. Oh
well, better luck next time.
