This film was, I'm sorry, *really* bad. I just can't see a point to it.
In the game, all you do is walk around and shoot zombies; the film is
exactly the same. There's just a bunch of guys walking around and
killing zombies, and occasionally the zombies kill one of them. Every
single moment of the film is a hundred percent predictable, so the
'plot twists' are obvious and the scary parts are simply not scary. The
acting is horrible, Marilyn Manson's soundtrack is exactly what you
might expect, the directing, plot and dialogue are non-existent.<br /><br />Well, I don't know... Maybe it would be scarier to watch on a big
screen in a darkened theater, but to me today's horror directors simply
got it wrong. You don't make a movie scary by showing lots of blood and
organs and people with no eyes or no jaws. A truly scary movie is
created by ATMOSPHERE (note Hitchkok and Kubrick). Seeing a guy being
sliced into a hundred little pieces isn't scary, it's repulsive. There
IS a difference, you know. Two thumbs down.
