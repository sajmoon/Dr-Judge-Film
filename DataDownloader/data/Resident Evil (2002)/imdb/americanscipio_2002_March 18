And the summary just about says it all.  What exactly about this movie
makes
it better than Tomb Raider?  EVERYTHING.<br /><br />1.  Action- good, violent, tense, without being too bloody.
2.  Characters- sure, they're two-dimensional at best, but Tomb Raider was
one-dimensional at best.
3.  Plot- Tomb Raider didn't have one that made any sense; Resident Evil
has
a very methodical plot, with a few sharp, predictable twists that make it
enjoyable popcorn flickage.
4.  Sequel set-up- never so blatant as in Resident Evil, but the movie
still
ends with a bang.
5.  Music- Okay, no U2 in this one, folks.  So maybe Tomb Raider wins one
category.<br /><br />Not a very good horror film at all, but a great action film, which puts it
directly at odds with the game series.  One good thing about the movie is
that we finally find out exactly how the T-Virus got released.  This is a
huge plus.  Another good thing is that none of the trademark characters
from
the games are involved directly, so the plot isn't fixed to their
fates.<br /><br />Most of the CG work is grisly real, and totally unnoticeable.  The dialogue
is sheer torture, and has no funny moments (I kept waiting for a vintage
line like &quot;the master of unlocking,&quot; but none was forthcoming).  But the
earnestness of the characters is sufficiently humorous that it leavens the
deadpan seriousness of the film.  I rated this one a seven; I wish the
music
had been better, and the dialogue sucked.  But otherwise the execution is
flawless.<br /><br />One thing: parents, leave the kids at home!  There were at least six kids
under age 10 who saw this movie at the same time I did.  Without exception,
they were crying at certain points of the movie.  This is just plain dumb.
It's rated R for a reason.
