I was actually expecting a lot worse.  Reading the reviews so far, it
seems
as if the main criticisms of this movie come from two areas:<br /><br />1. Fans of the Resident Evil videogames complain that the plot and
characters in the movie are different.<br /><br />2. Fans of George A. Romero's &quot;Trilogy of the Dead&quot; who complain that
it's
not up to the same standard as those films.<br /><br />Regarding the former group, I have played the games and was only really
impressed with the first one.  Furthermore, the weak plots of each
successive game contradict elements of the previous one and use
ridiculous
plot-twists to try and keep things interesting, so I can see why they
wanted
a completely fresh story for the movie.  Also, the characters of the game
had the ridiculous faux-English names that are common in Japanese
videogames.<br /><br />Regarding the latter group, I bought a copy of &quot;Trilogy of the Dead&quot; on
DVD
recently and I can't see what all the fuss is about.  Night of the Living
Dead is well below B-movie quality in terms of acting and plot (which is
almost non-existent).  The second movie similarly has a completely
directionless plot and dreadful special effects.<br /><br />Resident Evil, by contrast, has everything you want in a film that
pretends
to be no more than simple Saturday night zombie horror movie:   zombies,
cool special effects (esp. the laser sequence), memorable action
sequences,
a sense of humour &amp; some semblance of a plot.  Best served with take-away
food and some cold alcoholic beverages.<br /><br />Come on, what were you expecting?  Citizen Kane?
