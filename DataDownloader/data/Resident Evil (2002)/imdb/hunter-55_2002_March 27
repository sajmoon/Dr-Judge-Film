I had heard good things about this movie.  That it was a video game movie
that worked,  that it was actually scary.  It is with great disappointment,
then, that I must report that Resident Evil was none of those things.  There
are so many problems with this film.  The main one being that all the
characters and performances are excruciatingly one-note.  The worst of the
bunch is Michelle Rodriguez who never strays from that horrible scowl she
has on her face the entire film.  Milla Jovovich, while nice to look at,
gives a dull and lifeless performance.  The rest of the cast is simply
forgettable.  This movie ends with a set-up for a sequel which LOOKS to be
more promising than this one, but if Paul Anderson is in charge forget it. 
This doesn't measure up in any aspect to the classic George A. Romero zombie
trilogy.  This movie takes the genre that Romero practically invented, (and
which the video games admirably payed homage too) and destroys it.  Please
Mr. Romero make a new zombie film to erase the awful memory of this sorry
excuse for a movie about the walking dead!  Either that or I'll just have to
watch Dawn of the Dead again and again and again and again.....
