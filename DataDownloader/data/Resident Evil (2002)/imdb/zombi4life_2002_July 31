Well first of all I can see why this movie gets mixed reviwes.You got
hardcore horrer zombie or gore fans then you have your hollywood fans!This
movie was made with a big budget so it is more fancy if you will than say
a
b movie.So if corse it lacks gore and more brutality.The movie
unfortunatly
was made for the most part anyway hollywood!Im not saying this movie was
bad
it wasent it was great im a hardcore zombi movie fan and yes I would liked
to see a more gory and less hollywood styl of this movie but thats ok i
enjoy RE for its worth the laser scean was great some of the zombies
looked
great needed more zombies by the way.Anyway its worth checking out or
buying
im a fan of this kind of movie!!i give it a 7/10 thanx P.S the dvd of this
movie has cool features to it!!!!!!!!!
