Resident Evil is the worst movie. It seemed to get even more horrible as
it
went along, ending with what must have been the most awful ending in movie
history!! If they were to actually make it successful they should have
made
the entire shown movie into 30 minutes (quite possible, since the movie
kept
dragging on)and continue the plot from the actual ending. I really wasn't
hoping for &quot;Rambo&quot; meets &quot;The Night of the Living Dead,&quot; I was expecting
so
much more.
