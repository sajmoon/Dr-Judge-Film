Resident Evil could have been better if it would have just simplified things
a bit by taking out half of the 'cool' plot devices and focused more on the
zombies and a little thing I like to call character devel- opment. Just
trying to remember all of the babble that was thrown at me during this film
gives me a headache. Let's see, there's a blue virus, a green anti-virus,
some zombies that turn you into a zombie when they bite you, an extremely
HAL-like computer called the Red Queen who has a holographic representation
of itself that looks like the daughter of the company president, two
characters who have lost their memory and have many flashbacks, a laughably
bad CGI monster who gets stronger with each kill, a mansion that serves as
the emergency entrance to the Hive, lasers, circuit breakers, blah blah
blah. We also get a bunch of juvenile boo scares right out of a Jason movie,
multiple fake-outs, and an ending that hints at a sequel. Honestly, though,
the zombies were cool, and everything seemed just like the Resident Evil
games (we even get shots that look like intros to the 'next level' as it
were) and the scene with the lasers was satisfingly gross. However, the cast
pretty much stunk, and I didn't care about any of them when they were either
eaten/crushed/shot. I guess if you like the games there might be some stuff
here for you, but don't expect genius here. */****
