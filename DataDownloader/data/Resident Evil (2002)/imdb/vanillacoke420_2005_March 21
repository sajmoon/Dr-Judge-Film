I saw this when it first was up on the big screen, and then while I
thought it was pretty cool I kinda forgot about it. Then a few days ago
I saw it on TV, and I have to say, it's definitely better than I
remember it now.<br /><br />It starts out in a slightly surreal style as we get to follow the
employees of the Umbrella Corp., and the events leading to the disaster
in the underground laboratory. Then in the same style we get to follow
an agent waking up and how she meet the SWAT-like squad she's to work
together with to set things straight again.<br /><br />The overall feeling of the movie is hard to describe but I like it. No
nonsense, just straight forward action. No second wasted. I am sure
there were clich&eacute;s in this film but certainly not many and apparently
they didn't bother me anyway. Usually when you watch a B action you can
get bored simply because it's like every other B action. Not so with
Resident Evil, which was not B in my opinion.<br /><br />Visually, it's also great. At times it was almost a dream-like feeling,
from the intro laboratory scenes to the scenes from Alice's home; and
most that happened thereafter.<br /><br />As for storytelling, it told us what we needed to know, nothing more.
If there's anything from the introduction scenes that leaves us
wondering what in the world happened, who did it and why, we will get
the answers as the story moves on.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriquez both make their parts really well
in my opinion. I have not seen Milla in many other movies but what I've
seen so far, I definitely like. Michelle was entirely new to me as far
as I know, but I liked her performance.<br /><br />My complaint could possibly be that some devices in the laboratory
seemed a bit of a stretch, especially one particular security defense
mechanism that they encountered early on.<br /><br />All in all, a good action that is somewhat unusual in its style.
