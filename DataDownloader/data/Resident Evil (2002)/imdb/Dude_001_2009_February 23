2009_February 23 
It was just another day in the Hive- a high tech, underground
bioengineering facility- that is, until a deadly virus, know as the
T-Virus, is unleashed amongst the workers. A government supercomputer
seals the Hive killing everyone left inside. However, it doesn&#39;t end
there. A group of commandos are sent in to shut down the Hive for good,
and at the mouth of the Hive they find Alice, a woman suffering from
amnesia after being exposed to nerve gas. It seems becomes clear
however, that not all is what it seems in the Hive, and shutting her
down soon becomes the least of the teams worries...<br /><br />I am a huge fan of the Resident evil game series. My first exposure was
playing Resident Evil 2 on my Nintendo 64 in the dark hours of the
night, and jumping out of my skin when a licker crashed through a
window, or a zombie that appeared down and out suddenly grabbed at my
ankles. I remember playing Resident Evil 3 and being in absolute awe of
the Nemesis creature. I remember the dark atmosphere,the ambient
soundtrack. I remember the puzzles, some easy, some hard, and some just
plain frustrating.<br /><br />The Resident Evil film offers something quite different then we saw in
the video games, and many fans were displeased with this. Sure, the T-
Virus plays a central role, and a few enemies from the film make
appearances ( Those pesky Cerebus, the undead killer canines who often
jumped out at random to attack your character and almost always
traveled in packs, make quite a memorable appearance), but as a whole
this doesn&#39;t look, feel, or sound like Resident Evil. And though I love
the games, I really liked the slick action and stylish tone of this
flick, and despite it&#39;s shortcomings, I enjoyed this flick.<br /><br />A soundtrack can make all the difference for a film, or even a video
game. Gone are the spooky, eerie, piano ditties that populate the game.
To match the high tech tone of the film, shock rocker Marilyn Manson
and Marco Beltrami teamed up to create a totally new kind of musical
score that adds so much to the film. The film&#39;s music is very hardcore,
grinding, and violent. It&#39;s electronica with teeth, and it&#39;s perfect
for the film. It gives the film an extra layer that a lot of films,
especially action/horror films, lack.<br /><br />The film offers us no game characters, so we see no Jill Valentine, no
Leon S. Kennedy, no Albert Wesker. A whole new slew of fresh faces fill
this horror show, and this is one area where the film lacks. Many of
the characters are disposable, secondary characters that receive no
characterization. Even the main players, namely Alice, Rain, and Eric,
receive little substance. Milla Jovovich does a good job as a lead
action heroine, her merodic acting is forgivable because this girl has
so much presence. Milla&#39;s charm make a poorly written character shine.
Michelle Rodrigues, who I am not terribly fond of, does a great Vasquez
impression (from the Aliens film) and it works. She deliver my favorite
line of the film, after dispatching a zombie for the first time. Matt
Addison is decent as the wide eyed pretty boy. Also, not to be
forgotten, is Michaela Dicker, who&#39;s voice work for the Red Queen, the
homicidal supercomputer of the film, is superb.<br /><br />Paul W.S Anderson does a fairly good job in directing this film. The
film looks very vibrant, with bright colors, mainly reds and blues,
contrasted with more darker scenes. There are some very cool shots, and
some nice visual references to the game.<br /><br />I suppose one thing that bothered me was some of the CGI. Most notably
was the licker creature. Slightly different then the lickers found
roaming the walls of the RPD in Racoon city, I was quite disappointed
in the final result. The licker is one of my favorite Resident Evil
creatures, and this film did him no justice. The CGI licker looked
terrible, and the animatronics are not much better. Also tied in with
my disappointment at how the licker looked, and behaved, was the idea
that the licker was the &#39;boss&#39; creature. When I play Resident Evil, a
few shotgun or bow gun rounds take down most lickers I run into, so the
idea of the licker as a boss creature is a little silly.<br /><br />Overall, I really liked this live action Resident Evil. What Paul W.S.
Anderson and crew did was simply take the structure of the the Resident
Evil story and create an entirely different universe. As a fan of the
game, I can say that I truly grooved to this new presentation of
Resident Evil. A pulse pounding score, slick visuals,some exciting
stunts and a quirky sense of humor all give reason to watch this film.
Resident Evil&#39;s shortcoming&#39;s, mainly a lackluster script and a habit
of relying on CGI, are forgivable.<br /><br />And that ending... wow.<br /><br />8/10
