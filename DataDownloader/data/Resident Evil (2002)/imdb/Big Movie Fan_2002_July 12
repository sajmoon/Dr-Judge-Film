Day of the Dead was the last great zombie film in my opinion and that was
released back in 1985. Since then, there have been several mediocre zombie
films but this isn't one of them.<br /><br />Firstly, I haven't played the computer game at all so I cannot comment on
how it relates to this movie. As a movie, it stands out on it's
own.<br /><br />It mixes action and horror very well and the actors and actresses all play a
good part. Usually in zombie movies the people battling the zombies have no
personality but everyone in this movie does. The military type people make a
great impact looking all trigger happy but you soon start to feel sorry for
them and care for them as characters.
At first you are not sure why some of the characters are there but it's
great to see things unravel throughout the movie.<br /><br />This was the first movie in a long time where I kept jumping at certain
scenes. I won't spoil those scenes for you but there are some really creepy
scenes in this film. The zombies and other creatures in it are probably
going to give me and my girlfriend a few sleepless nights because they were
so scary.<br /><br />All in all, a pat on the back for those involved in this movie. It was very
exciting and I shall probably have to go out now and hire a computer console
in order to play the game so I can take part in the action
myself.
