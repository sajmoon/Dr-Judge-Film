I've seen true crap, and this isn't it. It's enjoyable, at times, but
at other times all the obviously-plastic props and rotten 'action'
sequences are just infuriating.<br /><br />The reviews for this movie are all completely off-base as well. I pity
people who claim this movie is gold. If you want a good modern zombie
flick, go get 28 Days Later. If you're obsessed with the fact that it
deviates from the game.. welcome to reality. Find me a solitary
game-to-film movie that doesn't.<br /><br />If you just are looking for another alright zombie movie, go for this.
It's no thriller, but it's not a complete waste. Hey, you could have
rented Zombie Lake right?<br /><br />This film is simply mediocre, no matter how you slice it.
