I admit it, I only went because Michelle and Milla were in this movie.
Everybody knows that Computergame-Movies sucks (Mortal Combat,
Streetfighter, Wing Commander...) STOP this just now has been changed. This
movie is cool. The 2 women surely did an excellent job, and are realy cool
when they are kicking some butts, but also the supporting cast was
excellent
(especialy if you thing of the genre of the movie).<br /><br />In short, good sound, cool action, sexy actors and a good pace.... Watch
it!
