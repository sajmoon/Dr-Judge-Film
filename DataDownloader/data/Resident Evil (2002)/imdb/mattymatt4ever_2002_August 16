I've never played the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; video game, being that I'm not a fan
of video games.  So maybe the story and characters will appeal more to the
fans of the video game.  They didn't appeal to me all that much.  But
altogether, it's fairly entertaining.  There's some really cool action and
special f/x.  The two lead actresses, Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez,
are extremely hot.  And the DVD commentary was amusing.  Paul Anderson also
directed the video game-based &quot;Mortal Kombat.&quot;  I have played that game,
back in the days of Super Nintendo, so I was able to appreciate that film
more.  If I saw &quot;Resident Evil&quot; in theaters, I wouldn't give it a
recommendation, but it's a pretty good rental.  <br /><br />My score:  5 (out of 10)
