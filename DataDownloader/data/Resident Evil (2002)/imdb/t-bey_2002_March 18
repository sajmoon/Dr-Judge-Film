I'd like to say 1st that if you expect to see a translation of the
videogame or are not a fan of zombie movies this movie is not for you. With
that said we can now move on to what could be the best horror movie of the
year and the best videogame-to-movie translation ever.
Constantin Films made a grave error in their advertising campaign by
changing the name of their film from Resident Evil:Ground Zero to Resident
Evil. This left many a fan comparing this movie to the original videogame,
getting them very ticked off at the changes that were not truly there. This
movie is in actuality a prequel to the 1st game. Complaints have been made
that none of the games characters are in the movie but in actuality they
shouldn't be if it's to be kept true to form.
The movie offers edge-of-your seat action, cute girls, good special
effects, and manages to tie up plotlines of the later games involving
Sherry
Birkin, Nemesis, Umbrella Corp, and Raccoon City. My rating
9/10.
