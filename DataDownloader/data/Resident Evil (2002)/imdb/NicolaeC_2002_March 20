If I had not played the RE games and loved it, this would have been a good
zombie flick.  I however played the RE games and I hated the changes that
were made to the plot. The movie had some good points. It keeps your
attention.  Lots of action and a not too complex plot.  Not the greatest,
but worth seeing.
