2004_April 7 

I had high hopes for this film. I had heard (from media hype, natch) that
it
might be the first decent videogame based movie ever. So I went to see it,
and for the first five minutes hopes were high, the slow zoom in with the
crunching industrial soundtrack was amazing, but it was downhill from
there.
Mila Jovovich finding herself in a strange place was intriguing, as was
the
lead up to her returning to the underground city (despite screamingly
awful
dialogue) and all seemed good. It was when the zombies appeared that this
film disintegrated into awful cliche ridden vacuousness. After that, it
was
just an awful, suspence-free regurgitation of superior films and
videogames.
I do not want to spoil the plot for those who have not seen it, but when a
zombie based movie does not use the word 'zombie' once, and takes an hour
to
realise the aforementioned undead should be shot in the head, something is
really wrong!
