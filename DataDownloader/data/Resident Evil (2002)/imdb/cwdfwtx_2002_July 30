laurzy and ibh8 ,the same comment twice by the same person logging on under
2 diff names. you must have too much time on your hands whoever you are.. 
this movie is not the worst made.  it was a video game made into a movie
which is what you get . i found it entertaining and yes should have been
more gore but you get what you get . all the people who slam it are looking
for another george romero thing, well its not suppose to be a night of the
living dead so get over it  ,, its a story about people who get trapped in a
community controlled mostly by a computer ,when a virus leaks out ,the
computer kills everyone and isolates the community as a protective measure
to keep it from spreading . of course the virus turns the dead into
rampaging zombies and a team of commandos goes to investigate. its a decent
movie so stop comparing it to george romeros movies.
