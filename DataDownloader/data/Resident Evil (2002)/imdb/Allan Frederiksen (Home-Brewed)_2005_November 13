My expectations were pretty high when I first heard about a movie
adaption of my all-time favorite video game - namely, Resident evil.
When I heard that Paul W.S. Anderson was directing, I kinda knew what
was coming. I mean, let's face it; his directing skills are just as bad
as a dead dogs breath... The eerie music, spooky atmosphere, great
characters and fine story which the first game contained was completely
gone in the film. Andersons attempt to scare and entertain us failed on
every level possible. I almost feel sorry for him, but mostly, I feel
sorry for the real fans of the games.<br /><br />If you want an intelligent and scary horror movie with good character
development, then avoid the film at all cost - On the other hand, if
you're into brainless action flicks, then this might be the ticket for
you...<br /><br />I give this film 3/10... 1 for the nice red dress worn by Milla - and 2
for the decent portrait of the Umbrella corp.
