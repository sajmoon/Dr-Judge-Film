Residents of the Earth know well they live is a scientific age. Their&#x27;s
is a modern world where every modern convenience is at one&#x27;s finger
tip. Yet, few know, or would want to know the cost which many paid to
have such a world kept secret. Now, Writer and Director Paul Anderson,
has unleashed a film called &#x22; Resident Evil &#x22; which exists hundreds of
feet below ground. There, a top secret science laboratory and a
fantastic computer called &#x27; The Red Queen &#x27; hums perfectly, until one
day it corrupts itself and releases a monstrous air-borne virus through
out the maze-like multi-level complex called &#x27;The Hive&#x27; causing
immediate changes among the employees. Jason Isaacs narrates how the
incredible computer become a danger to the world. Now a crack military
unit, led by their team leader, Ames Shade, or &#x27;One&#x27; (Colin Salmon) is
summoned to destroy her. Inside the private quarters, a scientist named
Alice (Milla Jovovich) awakens and cannot recall who or even what she
is. Other civilians like Spence Parks (James Purefoy), Matt Addison
(Eric Mabius) along with Rain Ocampo (Michelle Rodriguez) and Martin
Crewes (Chad Kaplan) are all at the mercy of the Red Queen as the
diabolical machine tries to kill them. Everywhere around them, mutant
humans and ravenous dogs await their attempt to escape. From beginning
to end, the movie demonstrates how fear can be generated from the
terror-fill environment. Excitement is everywhere and one never knows
just who is there to help or to hinder their progress. What can be
concluded is that once you&#x27;re in the Hive, chances are you will not
leave . . . alive! Recommended for those who seek to be frightened.
