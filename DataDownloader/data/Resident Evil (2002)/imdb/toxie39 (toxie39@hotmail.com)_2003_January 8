First off, I liked this movie!
However I liked the games a hell of a lot before seeing
this.
Being a fan of the games, I expected a good ammount of blood, guts and
gore.
My hopes were let down.
This movies was great. But as it is with most movies, it could have been
better. The gore was extremely tame, the plot was a mixture of the first
and
third games, (which in a way was good, however I did prefer the second
game)
the lead character was hot!
The acting was alright, but the best parts of the movie were obviously
copied from the other 'better' zombie movies of our time.
The gore was toned down for the mainstream audiences... which was to be
expected...
Oh well...
