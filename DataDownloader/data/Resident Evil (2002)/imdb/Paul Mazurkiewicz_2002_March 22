It's a good thing I didn't pay to see this, otherwise I would have asked
for
my money back. Quite awful acting on the whole, no explanation of who the
characters were (except the main two), complete and utter deviation from
the
plot of the games, jumbling of details from the games, not nearly enough
gore (I mean, there were many awkward cuts to other characters' reactions
to
violent events), bad attempts at humor, brutal errors anyone could see,
the
massively stupid surprise ending, and just generally inanity.  The
film wasn't the least bit scary, it was a &quot;Boo!&quot; film.<br /><br />The worst part is the film seems successful, so we will have another
butchery coming up in Resident Evil The Movie 2.
