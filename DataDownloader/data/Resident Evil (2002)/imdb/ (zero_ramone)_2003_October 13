Wow...this movie is unbelievable!!!!!  I am absolutely blown away...it's
very spectacular!<br /><br />Everything is right in the movie...the cast selection, the story, the
environment...everything.  I can't really say how many times I've watched
this movie, but every time I do watch it, it's like watching it for the
first time.  There's sooo much stuff packed in it that you can't absorb
everything through the first viewing of it.<br /><br />Lastly, I have to admit...Marylin Manson did a good job on composing the
music to the movie.  Hats off to ya, Marylin!
