i read in a magazine that ``the no talented one`` paul anderson said he was
a fan of the games (yeah right) .
if so then it would have been kept close to the game story line with some
changes not an entire cast change and a different mansion from the game
mansion the masion looked totally different from the game one the least
they
could have done was build some set pieces to match the mansion in the
game.<br /><br />it gets me so angry to think that this movie could have been something
special and what do we get someone who does not know how to make a good
film.
i mean look at his record - soldier/mortal kombat/event horizon they are
not
exactly great or goodfor that matter.
any person who like`s the games who think`s this is great needs to open
their eye`s and actually watch it 38 minutes pass without a zombie 38
minutes.
and where is the hunters or the plant 42 or the tyrant or the fire snake or
the lab monsters (the things that crawl across the ceilling in the boiler
room in the game) none of those were in it why ?.<br /><br />i have found an address for the original Resident Evil movie script if you
would like to know where it is (the script) contact me.
it`s better than the script that got the green light .<br /><br />this movie is average no more as are all anderson`s movies.
it frightens me to think what he is going to do to the nemisis film well
here`s some tips for it.<br /><br />(1) have more zombies in the movie this time and make it more action
because
the first half of the original was boring nothing happened for 38minutes
well just over 38 minutes before the first action scene.
people getting trapped in a bloody tunnel is not what i would call action
so
MORE ACTION MORE ZOMBIES.<br /><br />(2) if you are going to have the nemisis in this movie use - Kevin Peter
Hall as the nemisis he was the one who used to play the part of the
Predator
in those 2 action movies - perdator &amp;  predator 2.
he would be perfect as the nemisis and the right height as
well.<br /><br />(3) get rid of Milla Jovovich and get some one with talent and some one
who`s attractive like oh Miss Julie Condra she would be perfect as either
jill or claire .
she is in the movie - Crying Freeman an absolute beauty and a good
actress.
she is more than capable of taking the lead role in the evil
movie`s.<br /><br />(4) decent heavy music like - Iced Earth / Annihilator / Anthrax /
Sentenced
/ Charon.
Iron Maiden / Dimmu Borgir / Megadeth (old school style) / there are too
many bands to mention but they are all better than the muck that was on the
soundtrack oh well i will make an exception Rammstein were the only decent
band on it.
there should have been more talented bands on it instead of this commercial
metal nonsence.<br /><br />(5) replace the director (this should actually be #1).<br /><br />i could go on and on all day about how bad this movie is but i have better
things to do.
rating for the movie 3/10 could have been way way better.<br /><br />
