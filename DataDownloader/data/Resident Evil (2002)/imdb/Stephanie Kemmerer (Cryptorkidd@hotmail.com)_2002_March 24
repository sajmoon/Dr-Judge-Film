Let's talk Zombies. When you talk Zombies four names come up; George
Romero,
who started it all; Dario Argento, who branched off with his own lovely
visual feasts of gore; Lucio Fulci, the master of Italian zombies; and Tom
Savini who directed the superb 1990 color remake of Night of the Living
Dead. It may be time to throw in a fifth name. Paul Anderson's film has
finally sated my longtime need for a new and WORTHY zombie film!<br /><br />While critics are too busy complaining about how many movies they say are
&quot;imitated&quot; in Resident Evil-so busy in fact that they've forgotten to have
fun; it's obvious that Paul Anderson-or someone on his crew-is paying
attention not only to the official zombie films that started it all, but
the
fans of the original psychologically unnerving films.
Not only does Resident Evil follow the &quot;rules&quot; of the Romero trilogy, he
also threw in a few homages for those of us who &quot;know&quot; our zombie films
the
way some know a good wine or cigar.
Look for the beautifully redone &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; scene where a member of
the team is pulled into a sea of arms of zombies. Listen closely to the
music at the end of the film (composed and performed by Marilyn Manson,
who
has proved with the score that he has talent beyond visual shock), the
music
was obviously meant to mimic the sound of The Goblins who did the music
for
&quot;Dawn of the Dead.&quot; And the all-time kicker, THE DEAD WALK newspaper
headline at the end of the film. Straight out of the beginning of &quot;Day of
the Dead.&quot;
I may just be one of the few of my general age group (25) who are lucky
enough to have seen the films that started it all. Its hard to believe how
many people I've met who haven't seen the original trilogy!
Resident Evil was without a doubt an excellent supplement to the trilogy
and
remake. I definetly include it among the ranks of &quot;Zombie,&quot; &quot;Night of the
Living Dead,&quot; &quot;Dawn of the Dead,&quot; &quot;Day of the Dead,&quot; &quot;The Gates of Hell,&quot;
&quot;The House by the Cemetery&quot; and others.
If you want to talk actors, Mila Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez and not
only pleasing to the eye, but they have proved themselves worthy and
talented in playing &quot;tough chicks.&quot;
Screw the critics. I loved it, I only hope that those pesky rumors of
sequels are true!
