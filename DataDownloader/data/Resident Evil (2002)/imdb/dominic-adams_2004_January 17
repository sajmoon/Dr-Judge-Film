Although Resident Evil struggles to label itself a decent film, there is
no
doubt that it reflects everything it needs to so it can compete amongst
the
Hollywood mainstream. Paul Anderson is certainly not the best director
around, however, at least he reflects the game series for what it is.
people
constantly moan that the film doesn't do the game series justice, well why
not? it has the same stereotypical characters, the same environments, and
the same action. the only people that bother to see it are the people that
sit and play every game. Don't worry I'm one of them, but try and favour
Anderson's adaption of game's horror devices into movie ones. it can't be
easy, because we don't get to control the characters, however, he makes
sure
of some 'nifty' mainstream editing and some mindless action. people should
just  admit that this is the stuff they want to watch.
