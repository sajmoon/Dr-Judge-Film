2005_March 6 
I first played Resident Evil 2 shortly after I got a Playstation in
1999 on my 9th birthday.And it was one of the best games I have played
at that time. I would give it a 9.5 out of 10. Then I played Resident
Evil 3 and I had fun with that also 9.4 out of 10. I didn't played
Resident Evil Survivor. Resident Evil Director's Cut was just as good.
9.7 out of 10. Then I got a Playstation 2. Then I got Resident Evil
Code:Veronica X. 9.8 out of 10. I never played Resident Evil Dead Aim.
Then shortly after that I saw the Resident Evil movie. It wasn't the
best movie I ever saw, but I still liked it. The only thing I hated
about this movie was that they wanted to make boys to see this movie
was because a hot looking girl was wearing a red tube top and a mini
skirt. That not's what Resident Evil is about. It's about the horror,
the action, the monsters, maybe hot looking girls, but not wearing mini
skirts when she has no idea what is going on. Millia. Nothing personal
you were great in that movie. I especially liked that kick you did.
I'll still give this movie a good rating. 8/10.
