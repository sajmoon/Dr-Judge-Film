This is the best zombie movie ever, and thats a tough thing to do, to beat
out night, dawn, and day of the dead. This movie was more action than
horror
and they didn't have to use blood and gore to get good ratings, a sign of a
truly great movie. If you play the games, or even if you dont, I advise you
to go see this movie.
