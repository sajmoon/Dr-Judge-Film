I&#39;m a big fan of the Resident Evil video game series. So when it came
out in cinemas I was very excited. I was disappointed to hear that
George Romero had been replaced, with the guy (Paul W.S. Anderson) who
brought us such treasures as &#39;Mortal Kombat&#39;, and &#39;Alien vs. Predator&#39;.<br /><br />Still I was hopeful, despite my better judgment. I was expecting the
same brilliant terror I&#39;d come to love in Resident Evil. My hope was
crushed as the movie began, flashy special effects, soulless action
sequences. It was as if someone had taken the story, and hammered it
into a shadow of itself. I expected survival horror, what I got was
cheap action with clich&eacute; Hollywood shock scenes.<br /><br />This was not the marvel I expected. It lacked atmosphere, and relied
heavily upon overly dramatic music suited only to excite a brain dead
audience of zombies. A tribute to the works of George Romero, should
never have been trusted in the hands of Paul W.S Anderson, butcher of
great concepts.<br /><br />Even recalling this experience sends shivers down my spine, but not in
the way Paul W.S Anderson and his team of Hollywood butchers intended.
