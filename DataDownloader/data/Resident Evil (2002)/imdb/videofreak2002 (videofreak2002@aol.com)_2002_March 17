This movie just plain rocks!  It has great blood scenes, great cast (Milla
Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez), great music (Marco Beltrami and Marilyn
Madson), and great story (written by Paul Anderson).  It's a great
movie-adaption from a video game.<br /><br />I was so happy to see Anderson back on the director's chair. The last time
he taggled a movie based on a game was 1995's &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (which I
consider to be the best movie-adaption from a game.  The sequel was good
too).  But, the last movie Paul made was 1998's flop &quot;Soldier&quot; (which was
also good).  Even his 1997's &quot;Event Horizon was also good.  Not only that,
he also wrote and co-produced the movie.  His first time writing and
directing a movie since 1994's &quot;Shopping.&quot;  <br /><br />If you think &quot;Resident Evil&quot; is gonna be better than &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; and
&quot;Final Fantasy,&quot; you're right.  This movie is heart-pounding from beginning
to end.  Check it out.<br /><br />One last note to Paul Anderson: BRING ON THE SEQUEL!!!!  And make sure you
write and direct it as well.<br /><br />A+ 13/13 ****** (out of ****** stars)
