I was expecting good entertainment value, or, at least, some good <br /><br />special effects. Too bad, there is very little suspense, the plot is <br /><br />as linear as it can get: they go in, meet some zombies, they come out,<br /><br />no surprises. Okay, it's a &quot;horror&quot; movie, not a &quot;plot&quot; movie, but<br /><br />still it doesn't grip, one never comes to that point where there is no<br /><br />obvious way out. The spectator seems to be the most endangered species<br /><br />here, I believe at least some of them must have died of boredom. <br /><br />  
 
The make-up and effects would be about average for a 1950's horror<br /><br />movie, we have come to expect much, much better things in this computer <br /><br />graphics age. 
 
 
Finally, we aren't even granted comic relief. If they are going to<br /><br />emulate old horror movies, they should at least make it a parody, like<br /><br />they did with the recent &quot;Mummy&quot; remakes.
