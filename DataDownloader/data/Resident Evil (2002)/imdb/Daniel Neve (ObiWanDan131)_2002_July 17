I have always said &quot;why can't any film studios make a good movie from a
computer game&quot;. Every computer game movie to come out I have always thought
this is going to be the first good one, but each time I have been
disapointed with the like of Street Fighter (I never thought this one looked
good),Super Mario Brothers, Mortal Kombat, Final Fantasy and even Tomb
Raider.<br /><br />I was really hoping that Resident Evil would be different, not just because
I enjoy a good film but because I was a huge Resident Evil fan, and this
time I was not disapointed.<br /><br />The movie was such a great ride with the main characters in the movie, like
the game, having hidden secrets, which are not that hard to guess during the
movie but are interested.<br /><br />The casting was great for this film as well with Milla Jokovich proven how
to be a good tough lead for these types of films (take note Angelina Jolie).<br /><br />The start of the movie put you straight into the action before you could get
a handful of popcorn with lift fulling, people drowning and other strange
situations which seem to be a suspenceful as the game.<br /><br />Like the game I was always worried about want was going to happen
next.
There was also other scenes which were even more frightening especially the
action in the sewers.  <br /><br />The zombies were fantastic and very disturbing this was because they didn't
just want to kill the people (like in most scary movies) they wanted to eat
them  especially when they pulled a person into the lift and started eating
him, it was not that pretty.<br /><br />Some bits of the movie was strange with some of the scenes starting with the
group together and then suddenly Alice (Milla Jokovich) is walking down the
corridor on her own and you are thinking &quot;why would somebody do that&quot;, i
know it happens in every horror film but its just stupid.<br /><br />Their was also no huge spiders (which are in the game) that I expected to
jump out when they were in the sewers.<br /><br />I was a bit worried before watching this movie because it was made by Paul
Anderson who directed Soldier and Event Horizon. But now after watching
Resident Evil I am looking forward to Resident Evil 2: Nemeses.<br /><br />The ending to this movie was excellent as well because it makes you want to
see the sequel as soon as possible, like the Fellowship of the Rings
did.<br /><br />Final Review<br /><br />Everything about this movie made it a fun ride, the music,the licker and
Zombies, the main characters (good or bad)and the final showdown that made
you want to watch more, which say a lot.<br /><br />8/10 <br /><br />I think Sarah Michelle Gellar could be great Jill Valentine for the next
movie, because she has proven her self in Buffy.   <br /><br />
