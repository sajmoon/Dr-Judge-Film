When the movie started, it was actually pretty creepy and quite
interesting.
You had a woman who didn't know who she was or what was going on, getting
taken away by a group of soldiers who weren't willing to share everything
they knew.  When there was mystery and a psychotic computer, the movie
firmly had my interest.<br /><br />Then it became a zombie movie.  It was just 40 minutes of shooting things
and plot holes after that.  The only real redeeming quality was that Milla
Jovovich was pretty sexy.  That being said, it's not a good reason to see
this movie, but it is entertaining.  For a little while
anyway.
