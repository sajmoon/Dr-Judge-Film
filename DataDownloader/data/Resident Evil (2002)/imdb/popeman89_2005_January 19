There isn't much to distinguish Resident Evil from any other zombie
films; the same concept of how to kill the zombies or how the people
became zombies. The concept of a group of survivors being killed off is
also very conventional. The only fairly original part was the mutating
hunter that at the start looked like a giant vicious rabbit (I'm not
sure if that was a deliberate reference to Monty Python and the Holy
Grail). The only good thing that can be said about this film was that
Milla Jovovich was quite convincing as an amnesiac.<br /><br />Overall it is just like almost every other zombie film ever made
although it is watchable at times.<br /><br />4/10
