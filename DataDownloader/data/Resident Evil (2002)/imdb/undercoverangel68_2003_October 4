If you were one of those people narrow-minded enough to decide that this
movie was going to be exactly like the game, and that nothing else would
do,
than of course you were going to hate it, and that's why this movie has
gotten such a low reputation!
I, myself, loved the movie. It's one of my favorites. And yes, I do play
the
game, and I do agree that it wasn't especially based upon it. But some of
the scenes; the licker on the ceiling, etc, were straight from the game,
and
it was cool seeing that!
But the movie itself is just fun to watch. The plot is confusing, the
characters are rather flat; but the acting is good- not perfect, but good
enough!- and it's energizing and interesting. This was a low budget movie,
and it's nearly impossible to tell.
My only nitpicks were the licker, which was rather computerized, and the
diologue could have used work.
My favorite character was Rain- Michelle Rodriguez's acting was very good
in
this film, as was Kaplan's actor. Milla's was okay- she has a very
expressive face, and that, more than her acting, was what made her
character
believable. All of the other actors were fine, as well.
And the commentary- if you're planning on buying the movie, get the dvd.
It's absolutely hilarious, and has very little to do with the
movie.
But I would give this movie a 9 out of 10. Don't expect horror, don't
expect
a lot of suspense, and dont' be narrow minded enough to expect a game
replica!
But if you're looking for a fun, unique action film, this is a good one to
see- I highly reccomend it.
