Resident Evil was a wonderful horror movie. The zombies are realistic (as
far as zombies can get). The suspense is unbelievably haunting. Plus, the
end (with out giving to much away) was just plain cool.<br /><br />My only complaint was that it was too short, it could have been 4 hours
long and it still would have been to short. As far as it being like the
games: it's got a compilation of characters.<br /><br />I personally didn't like the game (well at least the first one) but, the
movie kicked-ass! I give it two thumbs up for being my favorite horror
movie
(Minus the Evil Dead trilogy) ever!
