2002_March 15 

First of all, I want to say that I have never played resident evil or even
seen it played, so I have no idea about accuracy to the game, etc.  That
being said I will review it as a movie only.<br /><br />This movie is incredibly tense.  Throughout the entire movie I kept waiting
for the next jolt/scare, knowing it was coming and still getting startled.
The plot proved vaguely interesting, but was largely lost in the carnage.
And of course since this is a sci-fi horror the ending left open the
possibility of Resident Evil 2.<br /><br />The acting was on par for a horror scifi movie.  Basically the cast was
Michelle Rodriguez, Milla Jovovitch and a bunch of guys no one cares about
except that they (in some cases) advance the plot.  Milla did a fine job
playing the beautiful but tough security agent with amnesia and something
to
hide.  Michelle played a thug, an annoying thug (as per her usual
endeavors).  Both actresses have their pseudo-trademark scenes.  For Milla
this means being nearly naked except for, to quote James Bond, A nice
nothing she is almost wearing.  For Michelle it is the sweaty hair in the
face snarl look.<br /><br />All in all it was better than most game turned movies and about on the same
level with other movies of the genre.
