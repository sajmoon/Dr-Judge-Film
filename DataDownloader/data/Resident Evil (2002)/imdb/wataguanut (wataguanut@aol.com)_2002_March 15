2002_March 15 

When I walked into the theatres today, I wasn't expecting much from the
director of such classics as &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;.  There was still, though,
that
lingering part in me that wanted the movie to rock.  Well, my friends, I
can
safely say that it does.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich (besides being scantily clad atleast three times) is
excellent in her role here, even with a trying plot device in the &quot;Amnesia
Sufferer&quot; bit.  Michelle Rodriguez mainly looks like somebody took a wiz
in
her corn flakes; hats off especially to James Purefoy and Eric Mabius, who
deliver a fine performance when most thought they'd bomb
horribly.<br /><br />Contrary to most reports, Resident Evil is not as gore-filled as sold on.
In fact, the low-level of gore compared to other horror flicks might be a
knock off for some die-hard zombie killers out there.  Still, this movie
suffices as a true zombie-flick in every sense of the word.  And hey, the
lazer deathtrap near the beginning was pretty neat as well.<br /><br />As far as movies go, Resident Evil wont be an Academy Award winner, nor
will
it likely make history in any sense of the word.  Still, as far as
entertainment and Game-to-Movie adaptions, Resident Evil is head &amp;
shoulders
above the rest to date.  Thus, I christen it with the 10-* vote.  Now,
against other horror movies &amp; films, I'd be more inclined with giving it
maybe a 7 or 7.5, but I'm a RE mark so sue me.
