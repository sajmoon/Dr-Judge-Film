Don't go in expecting the best video game film ever made or an
Oscar-worthy
performance. Resident Evil is the new incarnation of Night of the Living
Dead. The overall product is a fun zombie movie. The acting isn't the
best,
nor is the plot. The special effects are quite well.
There are some parts where you'll want to laugh, but overall it is a good
thrill-ride.
Good to see at least once.
