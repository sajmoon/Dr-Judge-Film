when i first heard about the game resident evil being made into a movie
i thought great. the game has a good story line to it. surely the trend
of making awful game-film adaptions must end? i couldn't have been more
wrong. as i sat in the cinema watching the film and getting more and
more confused about what was happening i realized someone in a suit
must have made the mistake of using a game title and hoped for success
on the back of it. the plot of the story isn't the best and the ending
makes very little sense. after watching it again (at gun point) i
understood the film a little more however i wouldn't recommend it to
anyone. as a horror movie (supposedly) there are perhaps only two or
three parts of the movie that you will jump to but apart from that its
a film to invite the girlfriend over after you tell her its terrifying
and get her to cuddle up to you. not worth watching lets hope if they
make a sequel they turn to the game for advice.
