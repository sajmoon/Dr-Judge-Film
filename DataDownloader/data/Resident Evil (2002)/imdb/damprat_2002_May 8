I saw this at the movies with my friends, and we all thought it was pretty
damn awesome... some of us liked the gore, the zombies were damn
freaky-lookin', Milla Jovovich was lovely as always and actually did a good
job with her action sequences, and Michelle Rodriguez, the chick with the
EYES, got all the coolest lines... the story was good, the opening sequence
was awesome, but for me the movie started when the troopers invaded and took
over... think I'll go see this again now.
