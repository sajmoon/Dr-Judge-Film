i watched this movie a few years ago and remember liking it.but not
this time.honestly,this movie is just one long bore,with a bit of
action thrown in occasionally.it just doesn&#39;t work for me,plain and
simple.there are two good things about it though.one is the pretty
decent makeup effects,and the other is the music,kind of a
techno/trance cross.otherwise,this felt like one of the longest 100
minutes of my life.to me,Doom is a better movie.it&#39;s fun and doesn&#39;t
take itself seriously.Maybe Resident Evil would have been better if
they had made it a bit lighter,or at least added some humour.or maybe
not.but for whatever reason,i just didn&#39;t like it.for me,Resident Evil
is a 3/10
