After reading the good reviews on the net, I can't say I went in to see the
preview of &quot;Resident Evil&quot; with little or no expectations. Indeed, I
expected &quot;the best movie made from a video game to date&quot;. I don't really
know if if was that, but &quot;Resident Evil&quot; was quite good. After all, I got
what I paid for, or expected, in the first place: A fast-paced action movie
which truly made fun.
The body count was great (on the zombie side), the soundtrack was well
fitting (from Techno to New Metal), Milla Jovovich was eye candy (as was
Michelle Rodriguez, at least in the beginning) and all in all, &quot;Resident
Evil&quot; was well worth the 4.50 EUR.
If you like your little-or-no-brain-required-but-many-bullets-flying action
movie from time to time, go see &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, you won't be disappointed.
7/10 Points.
