I have to say i really enjoyed Resident Evil, Milla Jovovich was
excellent in this and the whole movie captured what Resident Evil is
about. I loved the Zombie Dogs in this it looked really cool and i have
probably seen this movie like 30+ times already.<br /><br />I liked the Red Queen as well i mean the use of that was awesome with
Alice fighting off the UN-dead as well as dealing with a computed hell
bent on making sure they do not make it out alive.<br /><br />I remember catching this for the first time with my girlfriend and she
enjoyed this to. To me there was nothing missing from the movie what so
ever except i feel that it could have been made a little longer.<br /><br />I would encourage anyone to go ahead and take a look at this movie and
check it out for themselves.
