I think that Resident Evil, is one of the most terrible attempts ever, to
make a horror movie. One thing is that when you see this movie, you are
supposed to be scared by the zombies and the Licker, but you don't. Because
it is so clear that all of the monsters in this movie, is pure computer
graphic, and some of the actors and actresses in RE, they just CAN'T ACT.
But I think that this movie is one of the greatest attempts to make a movie
based on a game. So it deserves 8/10.<br /><br />&quot;I am too old for this *beep*&quot;
