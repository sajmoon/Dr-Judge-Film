I wonder why some people bother financing movies like Resident Evil.<br /><br />Honestly, it had some potential, however it ended up being an annoying and
disappointing movie.
I thought i should list a couple of reasons why one might not wanna go
watch
Resident Evil:<br /><br />1) The amazingly ridiculous flying kick by mila jovovich, fatalizing a
messed up leprous dog in the process.<br /><br />2) Michelle Rodriguez, damn... i don't really know why people employ her in
movies, but the way she talks and looks at the other actors is quite
irritating...well... some people might really like her attitude, but in my
opinion, her acting is pretty much like cheap trance music: repetitive. and
ANNOYING!!!!<br /><br />3) The first video game was such a masterpiece, well... it was slow... but
as not as boring as the movie. At least it took place in a haunted house.
In
RS -the movie, they tell you right away what's causing all the weird evil
crazy stuff... and the locations used reminded me more of a pointless van
damme sci fi movie than of the house in the original game.
[i'm sorry, my arguments might seem pretty weak, but i had such a bad
experience at the theater yesterday night... i don't even want to play the
devil's advocate here...)<br /><br />4) Special effects were not that great, and the resident-evilish creatures
were pretty sad... well, i felt ripped off...<br /><br />5) the directors try to freak you out by suprizing the audience every 5
minutes. it was pretty effective at the beginning of the film, but let me
tell you, after 25 minutes of false alerts, you get really annoyed...
yeah... basically... that's it... the movie is annoying, how many times do
i
have to write it?
if you like action movies, go watch iron monkey or something, if you like
sci fi, just go watch, i dunno.... ET... or alien.
if you like nice looking girls, well, mila jovovich gets pretty &quot;uglified&quot;
towards the end of the movie, and you're pretty much stuck with her and
rodriguez, whose sweaty face and greasy hair really ANNOYED me.  you're
better off renting &quot;bring it on&quot; or some other chick flick if you really
want to check out...<br /><br />actually, i have other good reasons for not wasting time and money watching
RE, but i'm gonna sound even meaner, so i think i should stop
here.
