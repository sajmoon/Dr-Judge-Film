It was the first Zombie movie I saw. OK, apart from the original ALIEN.
I guess you should never ask for logic and reasonable scenes and
sequences. In fact I guess this is what this genre is about - the more
unrealistic and freaky the better. Unfortunately - and this is mainly
the reason why I never watch these type of movies - there are no
surprises apart from Zombies coming on to your screen out of any
possible direction...and since you expect it anyway...what surprise is
there? To predictable and only effects don&#39; t do the trick to me. So
fellas, it was quite entertaining but not enough to make me watch
another one.
