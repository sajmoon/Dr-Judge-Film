Resident Evil what can I say I saw this at the movie theaters I love the
game and have played all but one and when I first saw the movie I was
disappointed that not one of the main characters were in the movie!but it
was okay but the more that I sit and watch it the more that I find that I
like it !It is a good movie but be prepared if you are an avid resident
evil
gamer you might be disappointed but give it a chance
The zombies look cool the zombie dogs are neat looking and the licker is
good !also if you notice the name of the train is named alexia the name of
Alfreds sister and the monster in veronica x I am ready for the sequel
Jill
Valentine is going to be in it !!!cool
