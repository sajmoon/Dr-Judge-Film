I have to say that this movie is quite possibly the worst THING i have
seen
since Jaws 4! Sarcastically speaking, it is a miracle...no other movie i
know of can substitute a plot with bad (almost constant) music, as
Resident
Evil does.  I was not impressed with the SFX or the characters - very
stereotypical.  R.E. was a monotonous, predictable waste of time and it is
doubtful if I will ever watch it again.  The only good thing about the
movie
was the end.
So in closing I would simply like to say this...If Paul Anderson SCREWS UP
the Aliens versus Predator movie as much as this one, he doesn't deserve a
director's job!!!!
