Well this is a very good movie, not an horror movie with espectacular
violent scenes but, as all the saga games, an action movie with scenes that
put our heart on the line. I&acute;m Waiting to hear how will be Jill Valentine,
that will kick Nemesis out of the game, sorry, movie, with the help of
Alice
( and that great scene from the end of resident evil 3 when a nuclear
missile lands in racoon city and the heroes are remembering there friends
and
the inocent people that have died).
