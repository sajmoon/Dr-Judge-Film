Now, all my friends that have seen this movie p*** and moan about how
it's not enough like the game or if they just would have made a movie
exactly like the game it would have been great. Mind you, I never
played the game (well, I played a little at a friends house) and I
thought this movie was pretty damn cool. If you don't take it at
face/game value it's got a good plot, with twists and scares and
whatnot, some pretty decent actors, some awesome CGI effects (and just
a bit o' nudity!). It's very chilling, especially the awesome ending,
and I can't wait for the sequel to come out. Milla Jovovich fighting
off zombies with guns in a red dress! What more could you ask for?!
