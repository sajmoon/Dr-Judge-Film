I have not played the video game but the film does have the look and feel of
an action game.  Which actually works quite well in fact.  This film has
great visuals from sets to special effects to action sequences. It is
probably one of the best video game based films yet.  In my opinion this
one's far better than last year's much lauded attempt to a game based film.<br /><br />Resident Evil has a straightforward plotline and wastes no time getting to
the point.  The pace is energetic if not frantic. Plot twists and new
details are not of the cheesy variety and are well integrated into the flow
of the film.  No goofy, quirky characters or plotlines make this film a more
serious and credible sci fi action film in the vein of Cameron's Aliens (if
not quite as strong).<br /><br />What Resident Evil lacked and could have improved on is the more development
and depth for the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; part itself. I can't expand on this here
without giving away the plotline. But this area, if improved, could have
made this a great movie movie indeed!<br /><br />
