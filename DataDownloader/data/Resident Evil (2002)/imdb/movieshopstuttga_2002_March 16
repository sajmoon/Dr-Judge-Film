Eagerly waiting for this movie to be released I found it quite
unsatisfying
when I finally saw it. The creepy atmosphere and the well done action
sequences can't help over the conglomerated plot made of two big chunks
from
DAWN OF THE DEAD and THE LIVING DEAD AT MANCHESTER MORGUE, a dash of
ALIENS,
and seasoned with several John Carpenter movies. But who thinks to find
the
gore and sometimes brilliant fiction of these splatter, horror and action
classics in this movie will be disappointed. Apart from a scene which
seemingly was inspired by the movie THE CUBE there is not much splatter in
it. The one shot in the head you see at the end of the movie is probably
topped every day on TV.
All characters are written very plain and bloodless. Milla Jovovich and
Michelle Rodriguez do their best to add some attraction to them. But they
are clearly outshone by the action and CGI effects.
I don't say that is an entirely bad movie. It only seems to be trimmed for
TV or computer games. It is fast paced, has two nice actresses and in some
moments it really gives you the creeps. Therefore it is
entertaining.
