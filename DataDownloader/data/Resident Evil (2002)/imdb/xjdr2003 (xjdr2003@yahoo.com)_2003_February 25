I have to agree with droogiedim77 on this one.  Resident Evil is an
excellent adaption from a game to a movie.  Sure the actors didn't do
anything oscar worthy, but they did live up to and exceed what was needed
for this movie to work.  To me, this movie resembled the &quot;Resident Evil&quot;
series nothing short of all too well.  Everything from Umbrella corp.,
the
mansion, S.T.A.R.S. team, t-virus, the zombies, and even the dogs which
were
my favorite(except Alice)were done with a lot of effort.  If you are a
fan
of the video game series like myself, then there is no reason why you
should
not like this one.  When this movie first came out on DVD, I hadn't even
seen it yet.  Only got it because of the video game series.  I knew I was
taking a chance because usually video games made into movies really suck,
Lord was I wrong.  I don't know if it would be a horror or a sci-fi.
People
say horror, but there is nothing scary about it.  Regardless, if you like
horror or sci-fi, give it a try, you will not regret it.  I give this a
10/10.
