** out of ****<br /><br />Resident Evil is sort of an unbalanced mixture of old-school zombie horror
and new-school filmmaking and special effects.  Everything about the movie
has to be a lot faster (except the zombies themselves, somewhat
surprisingly), there has to be martial arts complete with even some
wire-fu,
and it has slimy monsters that are rendered by CGI, not old-fashioned
animatronics.  As you can see, I was never particularly won over by the
film.<br /><br />Resident Evil opens in an underground laboratory called &quot;The
Hive,
a top-secret facility owned by a company called the Umbrella Corporation,
situated underneath Raccoon City.  One of the lab workers sabotages the
place, shutting the power down and unleashing a deadly virus that kills
its
victims and brings them back as zombies.<br /><br />We then cut to a cutie naked chick (Milla Jovovich) called Alice, who
awakens in a bathtub inside some large mansion; not only is she unclothed,
she's also suffering from a mild form of amnesia.  Before she can collect
her bearings (though she has enough time to put on a dress), an elite
military task force barges into the building, taking her and an outsider
(Eric Mabius) to the underground facility, directly connected to the
mansion.  Their mission is to shut down the Red Queen, the computer
controlling the lab, but they''ll have to get through flesh-eating zombies
and maniacal defense systems to accomplish that.<br /><br />As directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, the same man who crafted the far
superior
and terrifically frightening Event Horizon, Resident Evil is unfortunately
lacking in much of that film's thrills and chills.  Anderson shows an
inconsistent hand at staging and filming action sequences; the movie's
numerous shootouts and fight scenes are only mildly exciting at best,
hampered too often by close-up shots of big guns and expended shells.
Worse
yet, all the violence is sanitized; there's hardly any blood or gore in
this
picture.<br /><br />Actually, what's probably most memorable about the picture as a whole is
how
maddeningly inconsistent it is in terms of pacing and excitement.  For
every
scene that's fun to watch, there's another that's just plot-stopping,
whether it's watching it's watching the survivors move from one
bland-looking corridor to another, or Milla Jovovich jump-kicking zombie
dogs in slow motion, or a computer program tiresomely going over the very
simple zombie rules.<br /><br />There are also some glaring technical faults that I'm surprised were't
fixed
or edited in post-production, such as an unbearably loud industrial score
that blocks out most of the expository dialogue, most of it uttered by
Colin
Salmon, who if you're familiar with his work, already has a pretty quiet
voice that'd be inaudible matched up against anyone else in the
cast.<br /><br />The zombies in this movie are your basic &quot;pale and rotting skin&quot; undead,
some with the occasional missing bits of face and flesh.  Unfortunately,
the
zombies in this film have goofy-looking mechanical movements, as if though
their joints were so stiff, they could barely show much in the way of
mobility.  Maybe it's the effects of rigor mortis, but this makes zombies
far less enjoyable to observe.<br /><br />Most of the cast ranges from non-descript to just plain awful.  Easily the
worst of the bunch is Michelle Rodriguez, whose only distinct trait is a
perpetual frown; she's given a lot of macho dialogue, but Jenette
Goldstein
she is not.  Surprisingly, it's Jovovich who stands out as the film's
kickass heorine.  Sure, she's not much of an actress, but she's got the
physical stuff down pat, for the most part.  And she's cute enough that I
don't mind seeing her in a slinky red dress, as well as a couple of scenes
that briefly reveal some of her naughty bits.<br /><br />Because there's hardly any gore, Resident Evil doesn't really work all
that
well as a zombie flick.  And because it's not scary, horror is out of the
question, too.  But being a zombie fan, I'm prone to forgiving movies of
this ilk simply because I'm pretty easy to please.  Resident Evil is a
passable enough timewaster, worth a rental, but it's certainly nothing
I'll
ever give much thought to again.<br /><br />Compared to the recent spate of zombie horror, Resident might very well be
the most lackluster of the bunch.  It's never as intriguing or intelligent
as 28 Days Later or as marvelously thrilling as the Dawn of the Dead
remake
and it's never as hilariously enjoyable as the misguided House of the
Dead,
proving that mediocrity really can be less entertaining than plain
awfulness.
