Fast. Furious. Fabulous!<br /><br />If you are a fan of the PlayStation game of the name, then you will NOT be
disappointed. Unlike most other movies that are based on games (ie. Wing
Commander), Resident Evil is so close of the game that it scared me more
than the nasties on the screen. Okay, so the plot is a tad thin, and the
memory loss thing is just a bit too convenient, nevertheless I enjoyed the
rollercoaster ride that this movie provided.<br /><br />In a nutshell its blood, gore, sexy ladies and damn nasty zombies. The
movied played out as nicely as the game and so I figured it was a good way
to spend a almostly drizzly afternoon.<br /><br />8/10.
