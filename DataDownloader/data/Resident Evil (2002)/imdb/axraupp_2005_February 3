I'm not a fan of horror, and hate zombie movies. I didn't know anything
about this except it was a popular video game many years ago.<br /><br />This movie is not bad if you can get past the zombie slaughter fest.
The plot is actually quite a good sci-fi story.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to see the lack of gratuitous violence which
accompanies such schlock, especially since there were so many
opportunities to show things like beheadings.<br /><br />I didn't really need to have the fast-forward button close at hand to
zoom through the zombie parts as they seemed to be fairly quick.<br /><br />-Alex
