Some people may think video games are just simple, stupid things. But
some of them have stories. Stories that are......sad to say....better
than most movies.<br /><br />Resident evil is a popular game. So why not make a movie out of it? It
has a very good, believable story, that doesn&#39;t involve much clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />But this adaption to the game is horrible. The only thing similar to
the video game is the name. They make up new characters, make up new
story twists, none have anything to do with the video game.<br /><br />Strange thing is, Pual Anderson made this movie a &quot;reference to alice
and wonderland.&quot;............uh ya, its true, the main characters name
is alice, they inject the virus into the &quot;white bunny,&quot; the entrance to
the hive is like the entrance to wonderland, the red queen(same name as
the alice in wonderland red queen) says &quot;off with they&#39;re heads!!.&quot; Ya
whats up with that? how do you make a movie based on a video game, with
references to Alice in Wonderland.<br /><br />All in all, this movie woulda been a good movie if it had a different
name. This review is just to see how it compares to the video game, and
its not a great comparison. <br /><br />This movie isn&#39;t great.....
