resident evil, is at best a very mediocre action movie, and at its
worst, the most terrible zombie movie ever. <br /><br />The plot is contrived and predictable, the acting and diologue is
terrible, and I don't think I have ever felt less attached to a main
character.<br /><br />The effects in this movie are amateurish, and look like they've been
lifted strait out of the 1996 playstation game from which it takes its
name. Also, the game links are few and far between. The players names
are about where the similarity's end. <br /><br />if you are 12, it could be fun, but if you are any older, or have seen
any zombie movies prior to this, avoid.
