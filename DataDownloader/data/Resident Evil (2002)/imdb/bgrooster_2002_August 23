2002_August 23 

While i don't quite share the enthusiasm of the previous reviewer, I will
have to say that this movie takes me back to the good ol' days of gorey
zombie flicks. You even have to shoot them in the head in this movie,
too.
I was never a huge fan of the games, but I am a huge horror movie fan. Yes,
i love Night of the Living Dead (and no matter what anyone says, i also
loved the other two movies in the Dead &quot;Trilogy,&quot; so to speak). The best
horror flick to come out so far in 2002 if you ask me. Jason X was good if
you're into horror flicks, but it was more sci-fi horror.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this movie is directed by Anderson, who also directed
&quot;Event Horizon,&quot; hands down the best horror flick of 1997. Whether you like
the games or not, or even know of the games for that matter, you'll like
this movie if you're a fan of old-school zombie flicks (can anyone say
&quot;Pete
Jackson splatter-comedy a-la Bad Taste&quot; or &quot;Re-Animator?&quot;), in spite of the
fact that this one has a definite sci-fi/action twist to it. This one also
leaves room for a sequel without it being hokey (as opposed to most other
horror sequels, aside from the Halloween series :)  )....and if you're
wondering I have to say that the best horror flick of 2001,
beyond the shadow of a doubt, is &quot;Jeepers Creepers.&quot;
