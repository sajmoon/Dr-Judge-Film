2002_April 11 

Ultimately I had no expectations of this movie.  Although the
advertisements
did catch my attention and I was a huge fan of the original game...I didn't
expect greatness or failure from the movie.  Originally when they talked
George Romero or Sam Raimi as director and the possibility of stars such as
Kiefer Sutherland or Bruce Willis starring I will admit I did form some
sort
of image as to what I thought Resident Evil should.  This movie did not
come
close to what I had in my head...but it didn't matter...I still consider it
amazing.  The action was top notch and the music was pounding and
excellent.
It was futuristic (moreso than one would imagine) and the whole story
comes
together in such a way that you are left very, very satisfied.  The
characters and actors are excellent and you are definately left
disappointed
to see any one of them killed.  I would like to have seen more of them
survive.  Milla Jovovich comes through in a big way as the kick-butt
heroine
who gets some great dialogue.  This movie felt like X-Men in the way that
it
left you wanting more and it felt like it was only the beginning.  I
thought
the ending to Resident Evil was phenomenal and perfect and I couldn't have
wished for a better ending.  I hope that Hollywood carries on the grand
tradition of milking sequels because I would keep coming back for as many
installments of Resident Evil as they can churn out.
