As a teenager of 15, i would express my views as a teenager about this
movie.
Wow, this movie is excellent in terms of is effect. i love the part where
they are split apart form the laser. I was unexpected that the laser would
turn out to be in the net form. Hence it killed everyone down there
instead
of those usual movie which will at least left one survivor.<br /><br />This movie was very exciting. It gives us a feeling of horror too. This is
especially applied to the scene in which the dogs appeared, same to the
zombies. The design of the zombies characters and appearance had reached a
high standard. I just love the way they bite peoples' flesh
away.
However, the story plot were confusing and had pulled down the standard of
this movie.
