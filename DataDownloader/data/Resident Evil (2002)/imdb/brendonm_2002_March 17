This is not SENSE SENSIBILITY so if you want character development, look
elsewhere.  This is for people who like John Carpenter films and genre
pictures where all that matters is how the characters will stay alive (or
conversely, which will die by the end of the movie and
how).<br /><br />I played the game briefly a few years ago and was intrigued to see what this
movie would be like -- for what it is, it's good!  A fun (albeit LOUD)
popcorn flick that will keep you interested and guessing.  It has some flaws
(what were those things in the crates? And how many railroad cars have cargo
doors on the floor like that?) but I enjoyed this.  And Milla Jovovitch is a
hottie!  Loved how they set up the sequel (which we'll see, I presume, if
this one pulls down enough box office).<br /><br />
