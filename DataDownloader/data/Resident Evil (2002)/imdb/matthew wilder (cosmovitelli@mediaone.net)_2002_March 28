They are rather blockish--though not so noisome, in one's attempt<br /><br />to sop up Lara Croftian porno/violent kicks, as the perpetual On<br /><br />Our Backs-covergirl lip-sneer of Michelle Rodriguez, who peaked<br /><br />with the poster for GIRLFIGHT and has not changed a whit
since.<br /><br />Video games traffic in magics of geography. Movies shpritz<br /><br />together an alchemy of character, story, and &quot;the privileged<br /><br />moment.&quot; They are generally not about going from room to room to<br /><br />room to room (and when they are, the results are as bad as FOUR<br /><br />ROOMS or RUN LOLA RUN). <br /><br />This one starts out as a creepy anti-corporate number (quick<br /><br />studies of CAPRICORN ONE and THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR 
are evident) and then turns into some zany, Fulci-as-Xbox high<br /><br />gore style as characters are literally made into mincemeat with<br /><br />lasers and attacked by (why didn't anyone else think of this?)<br /><br />zombie dogs.<br /><br />Then it just gets dumb, dumber, dumbest; the movie has the<br /><br />distinction of featuring the worst zombie performances in any<br /><br />movie ever. The bug-eyed Italians in CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD<br /><br />are Burt Lancaster in THE LEOPARD by way of contrast.
