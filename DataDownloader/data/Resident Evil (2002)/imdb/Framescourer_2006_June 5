An over-sincere but occasionally effective remake of a computer game.
Pretty, young hard nuts have to try and get out of a concrete
sarcophagus. Along the way they have to battle a Hal (Kubrick&#39;s 2001)
ripoff, a small army of zombies that make Shaun of the Dead look like a
serious film and another character who shall remain incognito because
a) it would be a spoiler and b) it&#39;s shoddy CGI and doesn&#39;t deserve
discussing anyway.<br /><br />A whodunnit-type subplot is also in play to keep you interested,
because the killing sure as hell won&#39;t. It works OK and despite their
relentless 2-d seriousness the characters are all adequately presented;
I&#39;ve always liked the girning, Hispanic tough-girl Michelle Rodriquez
who manages to convince despite being typecast (see the equally
contrived S.W.A.T.).<br /><br />You&#39;ll watch this if you want exactly what you expect but in a
different package. With Milla Jovovich on the front of it, obviously.
2/10
