Now this doesn&#x27;t have almost nothing to do with the video games it
tries to adapt with. Besides the evil corporation, the same virus and
zombies, it does how ever have the survival horror feel to it and has
sort of the similar atmosphere as the video games. Now this film is a
mess for the most part, especially the last hour of it, but it&#x27;s still
a entertaining mess and the pacing is well done although it seems to
skip a lot of parts and scenes. The story is passable, not great though
alright for a video game adaptation and although not particularly scary
it has decent action scenes and zombie killings. The plot is basically
about a girl named Alice who worked for the Umbrella Corporation, who
gets amnesia from a chemical and gets dragged in and has to team up
with a group of commandos that is trying to infiltrate a underground
lab called The Hive in order to turn off the super computer called the
The Red Queen that killed off the workers after a virus outbreak. But
the team is in for more than they bargained for. The acting in this is
pretty bad, not terrible however. And although it isn&#x27;t a fantastic
film, it still is entertainment to some degree. Would have been better
if it had some of the video game elements of solving puzzles with more
flare to it and was compact better in a way it flowed better. Has a lot
of flaws and nothing about it is scary in anyway, but still decent.<br /><br />7/10
