A 21ST century version of George Romero's series of Zombie movies.Night of
the living Dead(1969),Dawn of the Dead(1978),and Day of the Dead(1984).It
follows all of the zombie movie rules laid out earlier.But,Mila Jovovich
looks good enough to eat so it is worth a look for those interested in
this
genre.
