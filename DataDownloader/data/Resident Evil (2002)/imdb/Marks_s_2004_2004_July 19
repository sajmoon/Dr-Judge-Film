The Umbrella Corporation is know for there healthcare, medical
supplies, and defense technology.One day,In there secret Underground
lab called &quot;The Hive&quot;,Red Queen,The Super Computer controlling it
all,Goes Homicidal and kills all the workers.Alice(Milla Jovovich)
Wakes up in a huge mansion.She has no idea who she is,Or where she
is.She see's a note saying &quot;Today all your dreams come True&quot;.Soon,A
Group of military soldiers break in,Including Rain(Michelle
Rodriguez).They head down to The Hive to shut it down,And soon realize
that none of there training,Can help them survive this...<br /><br />I'm not really a fan of the game(Only played the second) But this was a
pretty cool movie.Milla And Michelle are both very beautiful,And the
Zombies look great.The settings and dialouge are both good,And the
action scenes are good.The flashbacks were kind of cool,And the end was
great.The direction was great,But the CGI was pretty bad.
