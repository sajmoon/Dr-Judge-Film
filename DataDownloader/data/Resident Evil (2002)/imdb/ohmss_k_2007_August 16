i suppose if you had never played the video game,or even heard about
resident evil in general the movie isn&#39;t too bad.and its worth watching
at least once fan or not.not the greatest movie.but something worth
watch at least once.<br /><br />but speaking from a fans point of view,the movie was better than i
thought it was gonna be.but it was still pretty bad.for the following
reasons,im pretty sure if i guessed...about 1/2 or maybe over probably
only went to see the movie cause mila was acting in it,not cause the
movie was good or bad(not complaining).i personally wouldn&#39;t have hated
the movie so much if they had stuck with their own thing and not bring
in the actual story line into there own little created world.i think to
be honest that was one thing that killed it hard.i must admit some
things about the movie were done actually pretty good/real good ie..<br /><br />- the licker - the dogs<br /><br />other than that i cant really like anything else from the movie,if they
had made it a resident evil side story or something i would have
probably enjoyed the movie better.
