I've played the games and I had high hopes for this movie, though I didn't
expect them to be 100% true to the games. First off the whole mood was
lessened by the darn microphone that kept bobbing in from the top middle
of
the picture a 20-some odd times, very nice... Second, it seemed like this
was a well over 2 hours movie that had been cut down to 90 minutes by
someone very drunk.
This movie could've been so much better with just a little more work, but
it
was sloppy. Is it worth the money for a cinematicket ? No. Is it worth
renting as a video later on ? Maybe, if you're hung over. Is it worth
watching for free ? Sure, why not.<br /><br />X.
