2002_September 20 

In my opinion, this movie was an unfortunate waste of money for both, the
viewer as well as the producers.
You are better off watching one of the old original &quot;Zombie&quot; movies. I
felt
that the movie was packed with not necessarily impressive SFX to cover
all
the plot holes. There was nothing really new to neither the story nor the
way it was portrayed.
&quot;nuff said, it's not worth more of my or your time.
