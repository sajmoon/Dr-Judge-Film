Sort of a `Night of the Living Dead' for the cybernetic generation,
`Resident Evil' features a group of people trapped in a futuristic
subterranean biological weapons laboratory who are forced to do battle
against a host of mutant, flesh-eating zombies.  Based on a popular video
game, the movie feels like virtually every other film in which characters
are trapped in an enclosed setting where they find themselves being
systematically knocked off one by one courtesy of some malevolent,
super-human force.  (Think `Alien,' think `Invisible Man,' think `Deep Blue
Sea,' think `The Thing,' think several dozen other movies).  But `Resident
Evil' is not content to steal merely from those movies.  We are also treated
to the slow-motion, suspended-in-midair kickboxing moves from `The Matrix'
as well as the slide-and-dice laser beam from `Cube,' which manages to leave
body parts galore strewn all over a shiny hallway floor.<br /><br />Perhaps because the characters all seem to look and sound so much alike, I
kept getting the impression that the filmmakers were reusing the same actors
in different parts.  How else to account for the fact that characters seemed
to die in one scene, only to be miraculously resurrected for the next?  (And
I'm not talking about the zombies here).  Or perhaps it is simply because
the screenplay allows so few of them to distinguish themselves as
individuals that we end up getting that impression.  Though the art
direction and special effects are state-of-the-art, the script seems
woefully undernourished.   But then again, this has become far more the rule
than the exception in this particular genre of late.<br /><br />`Resident Evil' actually has a rather intriguing beginning and a very
effective (and brave) ending.  It's too bad that so much of what comes in
between the beginning and the end reeks of second-rate horror movie
theatrics.  `Resident Evil' is nothing more than George Romero given a
hollow, modern sheen.
