Finally, a superb movie, based on a great video game, that non gamers can
and will enjoy. This movie had a great story,  fabulous actors/actresses
and
a very well picked soundtrack. Suspense level was an 9 out of 10, no long
drawn out scenes so that even people with short attention spans could
enjoy.
Acting and screenplay asside, Rodriguez was very sexy and Jovovich was a
close second when she decided to flash us her topside early off then below
deck as a welcomed suprise. Overall i think everything was top notch, I
gave
this move a 9/10. It had everything I could ask for in an action movie and
I
can't wait for the second chapter of this awesome movie. Nemesis is one
bad
MF, i'm looking foreward to seeing him. So if you havn't seen this movie,
don't ruin it by downloading it off of Kaza or Morpheus...spend $5 and
treat
yourself.<br /><br />See you the second time through,
