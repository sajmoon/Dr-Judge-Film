If we look back to previous video game to film conversions, then you know
straight away not to set your sights too high. Even the greatest game can
be
turned into the worst film with ease.<br /><br />But this isn't the case with Resident Evil. Paul W Anderson has done an
excellent job of taking everything that made the games outstanding, and
bringing them to life before our eyes.<br /><br />Rather than trying to follow any of the Resident Evil titles, it begins
with
the initial biohazard alert, where the humans begin to mutate into flesh
eating zombies(!). This sets up the scene for great set pieces, like for
example when the military, deep in the factory core, are making their way
through a tunnel with darting lazers halting their progress.<br /><br />Of course the film is silly, with tongue firmly set in cheek, but at only
one real point does it go over the top, with Milla Jovovich's, Matrix
style,
kung fu kick in the face of a zombie dog hot on her heels.<br /><br />People have said that it leaves itself at a point for the sequel, but in my
opinion the film does not set itself up at all, merely just as a starting
point for where the games start.<br /><br />Obviously if you don't like horror-type films, this probably won't be for
you, but I enjoyed it, and found it much better than expected. Just
remember
not to take this stuff seriously, eh kids?<br /><br />A generous:- 8/10
