How many ways can a movie rip off other movies.<br /><br />1. One ''bullet time'' scene which served no purpose - stolen from The
Matrix.<br /><br />2. Wall walking slo-mo fight scene again stolen from The Matrix<br /><br />3. Supercomputer that controls a facility gone homicidal - stolen from
2001: a space odyssey<br /><br />4. Elite military team battling monsters with &quot;macho&quot; hispanic woman on
the team - stolen from Aliens.<br /><br />I won't accuse this movie of ripping off George Romero because a genre
is a genre and I have no problem if someone wants to make a zombie
movie.<br /><br />The zombies seemed a little too lethargic, even for zombies. The scene
where a soldier was trapped on some facility pipes just above some
hungry dead folks - it seemed that the zombies were going a little too
slow tring to get the guy, watch the scene and tell me if you weren't
wondering why the zombies didn't just crawl right up there and get him.
I guess they were giving him time to say his lines?
