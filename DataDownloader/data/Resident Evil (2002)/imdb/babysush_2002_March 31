I saw the film last night and was so into it. I watched my little brothers
play the game and when I saw the film I thought they did a great job. The
story line is good. Casting Mila for the main role was a good choice
because
she hardly had to say anything. It was all in her actions.<br /><br />All in all, I can't wait for the sequel.
