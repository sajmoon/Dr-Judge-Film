This must be the best adaption from a game to a movie ever.
After having been a fan of the game series for a long time,I really looked
forward to the movie and I had high expectations.And I was not disappointed
when the movie was finished.I recognized a lot from the games and the story
of the T-virus was well told.The parts that they left out in the story I'll
guess will be in the sequel that will be out 2003.The movie had action
non-stop and there were a lot of zombies and cool shoot out scenes.After
having seen all those terrible zombie movies from the 70s I was glad to see
this one.Without a doubt the best zombie movie I have seen.8 out of
10.
