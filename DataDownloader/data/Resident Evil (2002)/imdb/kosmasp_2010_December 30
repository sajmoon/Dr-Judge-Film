2010_December 30 
When I first watched this movie, I was still under the impression, that
it could have been made by George Romero. Not a good state of mind to
be watching any movie then (at least for me). If I had rated it back
then, it would have been a worse rating I can assure you that.
Especially because I had read a script (a first draft), of what Romero
would have done with it.<br /><br />But as it is, the movie kicked off (literally) a series of movies. And
when I re-watched it recently, I did so with the commentary on. And
when you listen to the people talk about this movie passionately, you
can&#x27;t help but almost fall in love with it. I was tempted to give it a
very high rating then. I think the middle way was good though. There
are things that have been done good here (some of the action, the
suspense stuff, the casting of Michelle Rodriguez) and others that
haven&#x27;t (the story, the rest of the action as Rodriguez does say so
herself on the commentary and some other things).<br /><br />All in all a decent horror movie, but nothing to get too excited about.
