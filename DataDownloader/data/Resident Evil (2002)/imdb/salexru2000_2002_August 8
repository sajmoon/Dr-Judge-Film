I'm biased by best games. This is definitely not the best one. Doom has
more
gore and blood, Halflife has more sense, Red Faction has more story,
Wolfenstein is more dynamic. I found myself yawning after &quot;hell unleashed&quot;.
Don't buy it - this is hardly worth rental fee.<br /><br />Such story requires dynamics and at least sympathy for heroes - I felt
none.
Jumpy episodes and loosely coupled at that are somewhat frustrating - like
tasteless food. Suspense is pushed on you (but misses target - it's too
thin) - and dissipates before you even start to feel it. Mix of Aliens,
Matrix and Living Dead - maybe too many ingredients? Or Robocop with
Terminator are missing?<br /><br />The only good thing I can remember - some of the effects. Computer ones.
Pity - not enough to make remarkable scenes. Not enough for remarkable
game.
