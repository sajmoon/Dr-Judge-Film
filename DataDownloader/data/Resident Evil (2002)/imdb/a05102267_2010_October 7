Many reviewers consider this to be one the best adaptations of a video
game into a film...Well, I have to disagree, mostly because I love all
the Resident Evil games, and even when this is much better than things
such as &#x22;Doom&#x22; or &#x22;Bloodrayne&#x22;, it is just doesn&#x27;t make any justice to
the original games in which this movie is inspired.<br /><br />This film betrays the original roots of the game, focusing in the
action rather than the horror parts (Sure: The games had lots of
action, but also had lots of thrills, mystery and subtlety, something
that this film completely lacks) The other problem with this film is
the terrible direction of Paul W.S. Anderson, which ruins a great
story, turning the whole thing into a huge mess that is barely
watchable. As a movie independent of the games, it is mediocre at best.
But as an adaptation it is just terrible, dreadful film.
