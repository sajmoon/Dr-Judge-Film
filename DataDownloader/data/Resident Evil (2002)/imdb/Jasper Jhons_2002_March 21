After seeing the film &quot;Resident Evil&quot; I was very pleased. Writer and
director Paul Anderson, who also made the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; movie has
successfully made another game to movie port. The movie makes many
references
to the video games, such as the 'Nemesis' and Leon Scott Kennedy
characters.... although you have to listen closely.<br /><br />If your wondering why you should bother with this one after losing faith
with video game to movies with that horrible offering &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; you
will
very much like this movie. The action is steady at times but picks up after
a while, it really does well in it's performance. I myself thought that
this
movie would be horrible, but to my surprize, I was dead wrong (yes that was
a cheap pun, I know).<br /><br />The plot is very thick and supported by a great cast. It doesn't quite
follow the games but is similar in it's own unique way.<br /><br />During the movie even the most die-hard horror movie fan will have jump
during some sequences. Thought there are many gaps in the scenes (due to
major editing as not to earn an NC-17 rating) the gaps in scenes do not
show
very well, I wasn't aware of this until I read an interesting review made
by
GameShark.com.<br /><br />The bottom line is simple, even if you have not played the video games,
you
will still understand this movie and really enjoy it. I had a really fun
time watching this movie, and so will you.<br /><br />If I had to rate this movie I think I would have to give it a 8 out of
ten.
In addition to its greatness it leaves room for a sequel, and trust me,
there's gonna be a sequel.
