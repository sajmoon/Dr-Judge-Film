No, Anderson should be shot. First he screws up Mortal Kombat totally, and
now his horrible directing skills have made it here to Resident
Evil.<br /><br />First off: This has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE GAME! Ok there are three
things:
The virus, there ARE zombies, Lisa Trevor is in there somewhere - But
she's
a computer not a mutated freak.<br /><br />Anderson has never played Resident Evil. There are simply so few
references
to the game it's scary. Examples: No shotgun (the survival horror's weapon
of choice) or Grenade launchers (because every female alive uses one.) And
no crate pushing! CRATE PUSHING!<br /><br />The biggest disappointed is easily the fact that none of the infamous
bosses
appear. No 50 foot long snakes, no 30 foot long sharks, not a single
spider,
or plants the size of houses. What an idiot to not see that people would
hate this. What an idiot with his budget.<br /><br />Oh and automatic weapons are for WUSSIES! You're not a man if you can't
take
down a zombie with a combat knife! Shotguns, pistols, and grenade
launchers
will protect you forever, trust me.
