A really boring and dull movie. Cheap and unconvincing special effects.
Lame actors. No plot. An awful soundtrack. Simply put, this is a very
boring movie. There is nothing to say about the plot, because there is
none. Almost no gore, and no suspense either. Doesn't deserve to be
called a zombie flick. It almost feels like Uwe Boll directed this
crap. It was almost as boring and lame as Alone in the dark. The first
ten minutes the movie feels a bit interesting, but it goes downhill
after that. There are no characters to care about. Nothing. At the end
of the movie I totally lost interest and nearly didn't make it through
the ending.
