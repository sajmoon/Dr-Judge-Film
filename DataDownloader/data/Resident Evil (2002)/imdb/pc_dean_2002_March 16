Making movies out of video games is tough work.  After all, video games
typically feature shallow, simplistic plots, dialogue that is corny,
head-scratchingly obtuse or unintentionally hilarious, and acting that is by
turns monotonous and overwrought.<br /><br />Actually, come to think of it, that pretty well describes the typical
Hollywood early-spring release.<br /><br />The &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series of survival-horror games is essentially a
hodgepodge of various horror movies, and so the movie based on it is, if you
can imagine, a hodgepodge of various horror movies.  The plot concerns dark
doings in &quot;the Hive&quot;, a secret underground lab run by the sinister Umbrella
Corporation, a bio-stuff manufacturer that is what Pfizer would be if Victor
Frankenstein were on the board of directors.  An experimental
zombie-creating virus is released in the Hive, prompting a response by its
overseer, a smarty-pants computer with a child's persona and a number of
gleefully sadistic security systems (anyone with a fear of elevators should
skip the first couple scenes).  A team of corporate commandos moves in, with
a number of comically elaborate weapons but few names (their medic's nametag
reads, &quot;Medic&quot;.) They are to secure the lab (under the circumstances, they
might have better sent a crack squad of expert morticians) and shut down the
computer.  Along the way, they seize a couple living in the house that
provides cover for the Hive entrance, as well as a cop who was sneaking
around, and, for reasons that aren't quite clear, take them along into the
Hive.  The couple is suffering memory loss due to nerve-gas exposure, and no
one is what they seem.  But you knew that already.  From there &quot;Resident
Evil&quot; turns into a zombie-killing haunted house war movie, as the heroes
have to battle not only the computer, but a hellish host of undead
creatures.  And it's pretty fun.<br /><br />The director is Paul Anderson, who also made &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, and like that
movie, &quot;Resident Evil&quot; is better than it really has any right to be. 
Anderson has a sure hand for creepy technological spaces.  He is economical
with light, and manages to make the Hive both shadowy and harshly lit, with
its flattening florescent lighting that make the heroes look half dead
themselves.  This sense of place is very important: among the hallmarks of
the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; games are their effectively creepy atmospherics. 
Playing often finds you strolling through the eerily quiet scene of some
past carnage, while unsettling ethereal music plays in the background. 
Anderson does not incorporate specific places from the games (as he has
dispensed with the games' familiar characters), but there are echoes of them
in the darkened hallways and flooded labs of the Hive.  The movie also
retains the games' problem-solving sensibilities, and there is a great deal
of shutting off/restoring the power, opening coded locks,
etc.<br /><br />The acting is good, if a bit underdeveloped.  This is a relief, since the
&quot;Resident Evil&quot; video games seem to prize sub-competent voice acting.  Milla
Jovovich plays the main character, Alice (Get it?  Alice goes down the
rabbit hole?  'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore'?  Oh, never mind.), and her
performance starts flat and inflates slowly over the course of the movie.  I
get that it's supposed to convey her memory loss, but it's still a bit
uneven.  Jovovich works better when she doesn't speak, displaying a quiet,
cornered-animal defiance that works well in this type of setting.  Plus her
other, um, visual qualities.  As commando Rain, Michelle Rodriguez seems to
be channelling Jenette Goldstein's immortal Pvt. Vasquez from &quot;Aliens&quot;, and
setting herself up for a long line of sneering toughgirl roles.  The weak
link is Eric Mabius, unconvincing as the cop, whose resume supposedly boasts
Quantico and the NSA, but is largely useless when the Bad Things come
(though he does oddly resemble game hero Chris Redfield).  A better
performance comes from Martin Crewes as a high-strung commando, who gets to
do a gratifying twist on the old &quot;I'm surrounded, but at least I've got one
bullet left&quot; scene.<br /><br />The visual style and fast pace of &quot;Resident Evil&quot; largely overcome its
sometimes faulty internal logic:  the transmission of the virus seems more
rooted in script convenience than anything else, and the computer, while
supposedly coldly logical, comes off nuttier than trail mix.  There is also
an unintentionally funny twist as the heroes are stressing over how to kill
the bullet-sponge zombies.  They need the computer to explain to them what
anyone with even passing knowledge of horror-movie physiology already knows:
the zombies' weakness is massive trauma to the cerebral cortex, i.e. shoot
them in the head.  Really, what's wrong with these people?  Haven't they
ever seen a George Romero movie?
