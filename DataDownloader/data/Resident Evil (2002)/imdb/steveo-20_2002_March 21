This time, they are completely wrong.
This is a perfectly good Saturday Afternoon Matinee movie.
A rock and roll horrorshow.
Read the critics and they say it's dumb and gory.
It's not gory.
It's not dumb.
They have lost their ability to suspend their disbelief and let the
movie set up the parameters and then tell the story.
It stays true to itself and pays off.
Go see this movie for all the reasons you've ever gone to a
sci/fi/horror movie and have a good time.
