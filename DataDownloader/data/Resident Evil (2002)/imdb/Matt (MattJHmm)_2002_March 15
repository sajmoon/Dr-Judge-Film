Excellent way to implement the story from the video game to the big screen
without making it too complex. They weren't twins by any means, but the
story line is definitely good, the plot is pretty thick and still somewhat
echoes the game. Unfortunately, there are no connections to the characters
within the actual game, but for the movie to stand on it's own and be
&quot;inspired&quot; by the game, rather than a cinematic version of it, it was done
nicely. Enjoy.
