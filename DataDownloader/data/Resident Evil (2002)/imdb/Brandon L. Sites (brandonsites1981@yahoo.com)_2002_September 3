-My number 2 pick for best film of the year as of now over films like Road
to Perdition, Signs, and My Big Fat Greek Wedding.<br /><br />Exciting adaption of the video game finds a group of soldiers led by Alice
(Milla Jovovich) sent to an under ground lab to contain a deadly virus that
re-animates the living dead and having to deal with an out of control
monster and an annoying computer. Fast paced thriller with a well chosen
cast, especially Milla, and stunning sets and production design. What it
lacks in character development, it more then makes up for it in terms of
sheer excitement and scares. The ending is a knockout!<br /><br />Rated R; Extreme Violence, Profanity, and Brief Nudity.
