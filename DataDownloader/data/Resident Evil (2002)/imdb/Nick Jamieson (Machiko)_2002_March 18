If you think you've seen everything there is to intense gunfights and
malevolent gore, you haven't seen this movie. The story sets out with Milla
Jovovich playing a woman who has suffered memory loss, when an elite team of
special military operatives bust in, in an effort to get into the secret
facility underneath her mansion. And the story takes off from there. The
sheer rush you get from this movie is unlike any ever before. The tension
this director has developed is far superior to any sci-fi flick in the past.
The dark blue mood of the facility, both before and after the incident,
really enhances the atmosphere. The creature effects are wicked, to say the
least, and the characters aren't overly developed, so as not to shadow the
true focus - running for your life from hunger crazed zombies. For those of
you who have played the game, you'll appreciate the 121. You know. An
awesome movie, that'll leave you wanting more, and waiting for a
sequel.
