I must say that I found it hard to believe that anyone would
contemplate doing a remake of this movie. I found the original film to
be really unique, very much like a Bergman film, in a league of its
own. I read all the books and saw all three movies, all of them
excellent.<br /><br />The Nordic feel to the movie is right in your face and everything feels
really authentic. The actors are all incredible, Rooney Mara &#x26;
Christopher Plummer in particular. The action is quite fast paced, with
very little time to get complacent.<br /><br />I was on the edge of my seat for the whole film, even though I knew
what was going to happen more or less. The ending with Harriet is
different from the original. Stieg Larrson makes equally fascinating
research for anyone who is interested in the man behind the movie. <br /><br />The photographs and all the research material used in the case file are
excellent and add to the feel of the movie.
