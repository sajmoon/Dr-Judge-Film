As soon as the Stieg Larsson movement made its way to North America, me
being a pop culture junkie, I was intrigued. But I hate to read. Lucky
for me, of course, the three books in the trilogy had already been made
into feature films in Sweden, and thus, I saw them all. And to be quite
frank, I didn&#x27;t really understand what all the fuss was about, as made
evident by my reviews of the first three films. The story seemed
choppy, convoluted and the films were far too long and seemed to drag
forever.<br /><br />I understand now that I think a fair amount was simply lost in
translation&#x85;or missed due to reading sub-titled.<br /><br />&#x22;The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo&#x22; has now been remade by an American
filmmaker. Although usually the kiss of death right there, well,
um&#x85;.Not this time.<br /><br />As soon as I heard there was to be a remake, I sorta cringed at the
thought, but once I saw the Swedish version, I couldn&#x27;t help but think
it could be improved upon considerably. And the story would be much
easier to follow in, you know, English. When I found out the man behind
the film was going to be David Fincher , however, I couldn&#x27;t imagine a
remake not being anything less than exquisite. With works of brilliance
like &#x22;Seven,&#x22; &#x22;Zodiac,&#x22; and his Oscar-nominated &#x22;The Social Network&#x22;
under his belt, this film couldn&#x27;t have possibly been anything less
than electrifying.<br /><br />And I was right. Right from his signature, breathtaking opening
credits.<br /><br />There were a lot of things about the story I had a hard time keeping
track of the first time around, but I remember the film. And what
Fincher managed to do was nothing short of beautiful. Staying very true
to the original film, but flushing out what I can only imagine to be
some of the more subtle details of the book, he has made a much more
uniform film.<br /><br />The incredibly talented (and stunning) Daniel Craig takes over the role
of Mickael Blomkvist, a discredited journalist who is hired by a
wealthy patriarch to try to solve the murder of his niece forty years
prior. Aided by a brilliant but troubled researcher, Lisbeth Salander,
they uncover corruption that goes far beyond what they expected to
find.<br /><br />Craig&#x27;s performance is nothing short of perfect, but Rooney Mara&#x27;s
transformation into Lisbeth is nothing short of extraordinary. Last
seen in a small role in &#x22;The Social Network,&#x22; the actress is almost
unrecognizable as she executes the troubled character with such
precision, watching her on screen is like a moving work of art, both
painful and graceful. Having just captured a Golden Globe nomination
for Best Actress, I would be hard pressed to imagine that her
nomination won&#x27;t translate into one for an Academy Award as well. A
nomination that I think she could have a serious shot of winning,
despite the obvious upcoming inclusion of some woman with the last name
of Streep.<br /><br />And although the rest of the supporting cast is made up of excellent
performances by the likes of Oscar-nominated Christopher Plummer,
Stellan Skarsgard, Robin Wright and a surprisingly strong showing for
an unexpected Joely Richardson (&#x22;Nip/Tuck&#x22;), the real artist here is,
once again, Fincher himself. Going against everything most American
directors attempt, Fincher did not try to Americanize the film in any
way. There was worry that he might water it down or make it more
Hollywood-friendly but the end result is, in fact, a film that is even
more violent, more distressing, and even more sexually charged than the
Swedish attempt. No corners were cut, no locations were changed, no
smoothing anything over to avoid an R rating. With just a slight
alteration for a more cohesive ending (no idea if this ending is not in
the book, or the original films ending is), Fincher managed to make the
film I completely expected him to make. And then some.<br /><br />Yes, the film does indeed run a little long, as did the original, but
with so much intrigue and twists and turns, it doesn&#x27;t run so long to
make you check the time. It simply manages to tell an excellent story
of familial corruption, while conveying the true, intense, incredible
hardships of a heartbreakingly beautiful and intelligent but violent
woman who has covered up her pain in makeup and hairspray. And tattoos.
