The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a prime example of why you should
pay attention to the messages a given movie is trying to send before
heading willy-nilly into a theater. This is a film that is based upon a
deeply disturbing series of books that spawned a deeply disturbing
series of foreign films and which features the tagline, &#x22;The feel bad
movie of Christmas.&#x22; If you read between the lines here, I believe you
should be able to make an educated guess as to the kind of movie this
really is.<br /><br />Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is a journalist whose career appears to
be over. After publishing a scathing expose on a powerful Swedish
businessman, Blomkvist is sued for libel and is found guilty, a finding
that will cost him his life savings, his reputation, and a short prison
sentence. At a loss for what to do next, Blomkvist takes a meeting with
Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), an aging but prominent corporate
leader. Blomkvist is presented with a proposition that turns out to be
more tempting that he could have ever imagined. Vanger promises to give
Blomkvist the evidence he needs to clear his name and in exchange,
Blomkvist will attempt to solve a mystery that has vexed the old man
for 40 years: the murder of Harriet, Vanger&#x27;s niece and favorite family
member who went missing at the age of 16. With the help of Lisbeth
Salander (Rooney Mara), a socially stunted but immensely valuable
private investigator, Blomkvist soon finds himself embroiled in a vast
and complex cover up that threatens to consume every aspect of his
life.<br /><br />To describe Dragon Tattoo as &#x22;rough&#x22; would require that you change the
definition of the word. More like &#x22;exceptionally brutal&#x22; and &#x22;not at
all something you&#x27;d want to see with your parents.&#x22; I feel sorry for
anyone who made the mistake of taking a post-Santa trip to the theater
with the family without knowing for sure what they were getting
themselves into. I was 14 when Titanic debuted and I had a number of
friends who had their Christmas Day movie with the family ruined by the
unexpected awkwardness of Kate Winslet&#x27;s breast popping up on the
screen. Dragon Tattoo is approximately one hundred thousand times
worse. Even the opening credits are a bit demented (though visually
stunning) and that&#x27;s just a sample of the brutality that follows.
Dragon Tattoo is about as raw as it gets for a mainstream movie and
despite the fact that I had read the book and knew what to expect, it
still made me squirm more than once.<br /><br />If you can get past the cringe factor, Dragon Tattoo is a quality but
ultimately flawed film. Director David Fincher put together a fantastic
cast filled with actors who fit their roles perfectly. Led by Craig&#x27;s
usual calm and understated demeanor, the performances within this film
are strong to quite strong, though none compare to the work of Rooney.
I don&#x27;t think this is an Oscar-caliber portrayal but it is certainly
one that will move her to the top of the list for a number of high
profile roles over the next few years. And as always with a Fincher
film, the technical aspects of Dragon Tattoo are exquisite. From the
score to the shot selection, this is barely a step down from The Social
Network, which was nearly perfect from a behind-the-camera standpoint.
Fincher uses every element like it belongs to his directorial Swiss
army knife, heightening the intensity here, providing subtle detail
there. Fincher is the master of creating imperceptible tension within
each audience member, building it until you suddenly realize that
you&#x27;re sitting on the edge of your seat and your heart is pounding. In
this regard, Dragon Tattoo provides the perfect subject matter.<br /><br />But where the film struggles is in the way Fincher tries to tell a
convoluted, web-like story. In the book, author Stieg Larsson weaves
together several stories that don&#x27;t initially seem to connect in the
beginning and he does so in excruciating detail. It is a slowburn of a
read but one that I found compelling. In order to present every concept
within the book, however, Fincher makes the mistake of jamming almost
every ounce of story from the source material into the film. The first
third of the movie, then, moves at a rapid pace that doesn&#x27;t fit the
story, the characters, or even the actors. There&#x27;s a hint of Aaron
Sorkin in the dialogue but it doesn&#x27;t contain the expert craftsmanship
that usually accompanies a Sorkin script and it doesn&#x27;t fit Craig&#x27;s
brand of subdued acting. Moreover, Fincher tries to pack an excessive
amount of information into the first act and none of it connects very
well. As a result, we get a number of short, choppy scenes that don&#x27;t
flow together and make it quite difficult to settle in. I&#x27;m a big fan
of Fincher overall but I think Dragon Tattoo displays his limitations,
or at least his weaknesses. Far from Fincher&#x27;s master work, it is
nonetheless an intriguing and worthwhile film that you may not want to
take in on a full stomach.
