brilliant movie. kind of psycho though.there&#x27;s this girl (rooney Mara)
professional computer hacker.she can hack into any hard-disk via
internet- amazing,fantastic. the girl was scary , yet m in love with
her character. Daniel Craig was looking fat and stupid throughout the
movie.hadn&#x27;t it been for the girl, he was a helpless poor chap.the
girl&#x27;s experience of burning her father was such an charismatic scene-
the way she throws petrol at him ,throws a lit matchstick , then steps
back.brilliant exemplary cinematography. then there was a religious
fanatic. the killings and raping were a perfect example for religious
fanaticism.the father raping her daughter , the child being taught how
to rape and strandle by his own father - what a pathetic upbringing he
had. sick , retarded and pathetic. the rape scene, the forced blow-job
scene were hard to digest.especially the blow-job scene was perfectly
cinematographed. the sex scene was a little phys-co , but nevertheless
superb. the ending was a nice twist in the story.
