The highlight of this film is Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander. Lisbeth
is an investigator who gets involved in what becomes a serial murder
mystery from many years before. Lisbeth is a complex character. She&#x27;s
troubled and mysterious, deeply vulnerable and yet surprisingly strong
at the same time; qualities all brought out effectively by her
appearance (strange hair styles and multiple piercings) and by an often
distant look about her - a sort of detachment perhaps quite believable
for a character with her history. Mara captured the contradictions of
the character perfectly. Although I have to admit that I wasn&#x27;t that
taken with the movie as a whole, I was drawn to Lisbeth; I cared about
her. I hurt when she hurt. The scenes between Lisbeth and Nils (Yorick
van Waginingen) - both those in which she was being abused and the
scene in which she took her revenge (and even the brief later scene in
the elevator) - were powerful and disturbing. I&#x27;ve not felt that
attached to a character in a long while, so kudos to Mara for drawing
out such a reaction - especially since, as I said, she managed to do it
in a movie that just didn&#x27;t appeal to me very much.<br /><br />The overall story was not unlike the character of Lisbeth - strange and
confusing and complex and mysterious, but on the whole it failed to
connect with me in the way the character of Lisbeth did. And, as much
as I was drawn to the character, part of the problem with the story was
that so much of it revolved around Lisbeth. The rape/revenge scenes may
have been powerful and disturbing, but they didn&#x27;t really seem to
connect that well with the main point of the movie, which was the
search for the serial killer&#x27;s identity, and the one victim of Harriet
in particular. To me, it seemed almost as if director David Fincher
realized that the story he was telling was almost totally lacking in
coherence. That basic incoherence (or even unattractiveness) was well
summed up by Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer). Speaking with Mikael
(Daniel Craig) - who he&#x27;s asked to look into the disappearance of his
niece Harriet many years before - he explains the bewildering nature of
his relatives (a bunch consisting of some Nazis and neo-Nazis and some
who won&#x27;t speak to them because they&#x27;re Nazis and neo-Nazis) and when
Mikael tells him that he&#x27;s having trouble keeping everything straight,
Henrik responds, &#x22;Soon you&#x27;ll know us all too well, with my apologies.&#x22;
A point for honesty I guess. There&#x27;s little in this story or in its
characters that&#x27;s either pleasant or attractive so Fincher seems to
have chosen to over-emphasize Lisbeth&#x27;s troubles (the one strong part
of the script) - the problem being that this one strong part of the
script wasn&#x27;t essential to the story. Very strange to me.<br /><br />In any event, the movie really lost me right from the start with a
bizarre opening sequences and musical score that lasted far, far too
long, and it never really drew me consistently back in. Kudos to Rooney
Mara for a fine performance, but the movie overall was quite lacking.
(3/10)
