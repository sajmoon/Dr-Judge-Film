The above quote is used only once in the movie, but it ironically sets
the tone for the entire film.<br /><br />&#x22;Dragon Tattoo&#x22; has a strong chance of being the most memorable
adaptation of a book since Harry Potter. David Fincher&#x27;s follow up to
&#x22;The Social Network&#x22; is nothing short of a terrifically terrible roller
coaster ride of unpredictability. <br /><br />As far as acting goes, Daniel Craig and Chris Plummer gave their usual
stellar performances. The shining star, however, was obviously Rooney
Mara, who gave a downright chilling performance. Aside from her
Oscar-worthy acting, the fact that she was willing to change her body
so drastically for this role says a lot about her character. She isn&#x27;t
here to be another role model or sex symbol, but she is here to be what
many Hollywood stars are drawn away from being: a damn good actress. We
have without a doubt not seen the last of Mara.<br /><br />This movie was able to take a simple mystery case and turn it into the
most interesting movie of the season. Be warned, however, for as the
quote suggests, it is also one of the most brutally graphic movies of
the year. The scenes are so captivating, however, that you may not even
remember that you are surrounded by other people anyway. However, it is
still not by any means a family/date movie. Be very selective while
deciding who you see this one with.
