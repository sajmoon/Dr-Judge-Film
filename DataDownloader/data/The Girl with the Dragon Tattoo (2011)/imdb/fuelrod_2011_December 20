It can be put short: If you have seen the original Swedish version
don&#x27;t waste your time watching this one.<br /><br />Forget all the talk about &#x22;this is not a remake - this is a new
adaptation&#x22;. If you hear or read somebody state that, they only prove
they have not seen Arcel &#x26; Oplev&#x27;s version because this American try
out is most of all a scene by scene remake - even many of the locations
are the same! The pro of Finchers version is the performance of Rooney
Mara. It is very close to match Rapaces international breakthrough.<br /><br />The no. 1 con is Finchers total lack of adding anything new or original
to this remake. The only major contributions Fincher brings to the
table is a fat and slick visual style, and a rude Hollywood
simplification of the storyline presented in both the novel and the
original movie adaptation.<br /><br />I rate 5/10 - a simplified copy cat of a (only) two years old movie...
what a waste!
