The 2009 version had a much better story and was far more raw, rugged,
and compelling. I was incredibly disappointed by this Hollywood retake.
The acting in this version was solid which is to be expected from the 5
star cast on display here. However this story really lacked by
comparison, it dragged on and on to the point of boredom. In this
versions its characters didn&#x27;t interact into this film story much
during its course. They were given little time outside of its main two
characters, Rooney and Craig who interacted with each other to much.
Also a lot of the elements here seemed to be cut out and were made
differently. This took away a lot of the edge and mystery of the
original film.<br /><br />I am curious on how Fincher takes the next two books in the trilogy,
although with this film the original 2009 version was better.<br /><br />6.5 out of 10
