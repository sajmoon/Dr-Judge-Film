This is the best movie I&#x27;ve ever seen. I saw it last night and cannot
stop thinking about it. I am beyond excited for the future creation of
the last 2 movies in the trilogy. After seeing the first one it has
sparked my interest in the novels and I am going to purchase the
trilogy and read them. I am very excited to read the books as I am to
watch the rest of the trilogy in theaters. I cannot get enough of
Lisbeth, I think she is one of the best characters created in
literature or film. Her character is so mysterious that it keeps you
hooked the entire time, Rooney Mara did a fantastic job in depicting
Lisbeth. The constant mystery and twists are a great formula to a
5-star movie.
