Yikes. What was all the hype about with this film? First off, it felt
so dated - maybe in 1985-1995 this would&#x27;ve seemed relevant. And s - l
- o - w. If you&#x27;re a film buff, you find yourself going - Ah, this
feels like the original Wicker Man (isolated island ...is it going to
be a pagan cult murder pact?), and that feels like The Ghost Writer
(isolated enclave, rich people, modernist architecture), The Vanishing
(creepy northern European sadist), a sprinkle of Hostel (control and
intent to torture and murder), with the gimmick of a pierced, tattooed
Gen-Xer waif girl as a co-protagonist. <br /><br />The story unfolds along parallel streams and it&#x27;s nearly halfway
through the film that our male writer protagonist finally partners with
Pierced Girl. Nothing is terribly interesting or new - you have seen it
all before. Bits and pieces were put together from other films for this
film. There is no actual suspense at any point in the film, and while
visually pretty, it is nothing groundbreaking. Fincher, the director,
went with this washed-out blue-grey color palette for his visual
undertone and it is bleak but lends nothing. Gratuitous nudity and sex
pop up again and again and never once is it necessary to propel the
story. <br /><br />The girl is supposed to be near-feral and it just doesn&#x27;t wash. How
would such a street-smart hacker chick who is so clever she gets hired
by a powerful law firm to do background checks get herself in a
vulnerable position with a sex-hungry fat slob of a social case-worker
who controls her money? If her intent all along was to appear
vulnerable so she could gain the upper hand and extort this guy it
didn&#x27;t sell - the movie played as if she was compromised somehow. And a
tough, feral chick like that hasn&#x27;t already done anal sex? The shots of
her walking painfully after the anal rape and in the shower bleeding
and defecating from her anus were real emblems of how far filmmaking
has fallen.<br /><br />Oh, and we get a cute kitty cat chopped up into pieces which connects
to ... nothing. The &#x22;mystery&#x22; of who&#x27;s in the pictures and who took the
pictures and so on is completely without tension or suspense or
interest - we yawn as the process unfolds without any profound reveals. <br /><br />The kicker for just how stupid this film is when Pierced Girl suddenly
morphs into super-spy and drains the awful subplot billionaire
character&#x27;s money from his accounts. She had those skills yet needed to
suck up (literally) to her coercive social worker for paltry checks?
And the real clang of just how dumb this story and movie is during the
final scene when she gets all sad because hero writer man has a
girlfriend already and so she tosses the fancy leather jacket she
bought him and sweet card into the garbage. Is this not the same girl
who &#x22;knows -him- better than his closest friend do?&#x22; because her
back-grounding on him was so thorough? <br /><br />Save yourself a kick in the head and avoid this bad film and instead
watch the original of The Wicker Man, The Vanishing, and The Ghost
Writer and see what Girl With the Dragon Tattoo tried to do.
