If I had a wish, it would be that I had seen this version before the
Swedish version. That isn&#x27;t the case however. After having seen the
Swedish one, I have to admit I wasn&#x27;t hooked for the first hour. And we
rarely say that of a Fincher flick. I liked the second half of the
movie a lot though. It was fast-paced, gripping and played out well.
Rooney Mara was very good in my opinion, and Oscar-worthy too; I found
more than a handful of reviews that said she was &#x27;boring&#x27; but that
isn&#x27;t the case, it takes a lot of boldness to shoot those
more-than-usual explicit scenes and she did them with almost a
Lisbeth-like quality. But Daniel Craig was quite disappointing. He
didn&#x27;t seem involved enough. Seriously I don&#x27;t know why Fincher wanted
him or the role so badly - I was against it from the very beginning.
Good but I expect more from the sequel(s). 7/10
