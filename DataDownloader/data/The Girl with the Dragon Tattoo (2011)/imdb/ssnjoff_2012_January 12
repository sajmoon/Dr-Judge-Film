Disappointment<br /><br />Well, first of all, I didn&#x27;t expect too much but, still, with the
rating that higher then the Swedish version, I was surprised of how
mediocre American version was. I was disappointed by almost every
aspect of the movie. Even with the photography. As English is not my
first language, I&#x27;ll be brief. Craig &#x96; better than I expected, yet too
polished. Nyqvist was so much more convincing&#x85; Mara &#x96; boring, with just
two tones of voice through entire movie. I suppose, this monotony
should convince us that she was cold and unattached, appearance &#x96; OK.
For me, Rapace was Lisbeth. Skarsgard &#x96; exceptional Storyline &#x96; didn&#x27;t
like the changes (compared to the book) and hated the rhythm as it kept
too many details from the book; as a result, the movie looked like a
photo album, hopping from one picture to another in fast pace.
Directing &#x96; anemic Music &#x96; OK at the beginning, then irritating&#x85;hurting
my ears. To conclude, if I had seen it before the book and Swedish
version, it would have been OK. As it wasn&#x27;t the case, I shall remember
it as unconvincing and redundant. Then again, it&#x27;s just me&#x85;
