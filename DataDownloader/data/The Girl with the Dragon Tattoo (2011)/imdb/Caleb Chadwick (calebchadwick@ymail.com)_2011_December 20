Right from the start of this films opening titles, I was taken back to
when I had first watched &#x27;Fight Club&#x27;. The opening title sequence for
this film was even more exhilarating to watch than that of the one
opening for Fight Club. The rest of the film was a journey into the
greatness that has made Fincher films almost a household name by now. <br /><br />It is easy to say that this was better than the Swedish version of this
film, and partly thanks to the performance by Rooney Mara as Lisbeth
Salander. I can&#x27;t say that I have ever been more attracted to a
character on film than in this one. Even though, she is quite the
bad-ass and about as tomboy as they come, I couldn&#x27;t help but be
engaged by every scene she was in. <br /><br />On another note, this is not an easy film to watch. It does contain a
scene of rape and a couple acts of sexual assault on top of that. With
all these coming together to form something almost as disturbing as the
scene from the lesser know film by Gaspar Noe &#x27;Irreversible&#x27;. <br /><br />Everything is perfectly shot here as well, and really does have the
&#x27;David Fincher&#x27; touch, although, this film felt about the least
Hollywood-ised of all his pictures. Fans of the Swedish Trilogy will
not be let down here. This is about as intense as crime thrillers get,
and for those who call this a remake, for them, this is without a doubt
the best remake I think I have seen on screen. Nothing falls into place
like you think it will, and as the film ends, I felt a knot in my
stomach, and wished I could know the character Lisbeth in real life. <br /><br />The score here done by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is again Oscar
worthy after winning last year for their work on Finchers other film,
&#x27;The Social Network&#x27;. It does have similar tones here, but all in all
comes out totally fresh in every scene.<br /><br />Overall, this is easily one of the best films of the year. This could
have also been easily predicted coming from me, considering my likeness
for David Fincher films. Fincher was responsible for me partly coming
to love for films back in 1999 with his film &#x27;Fight Club&#x27;, which took
1/3 of the reason why I came to love movies in the first place (also in
there, Stanley Kubricks &#x27;Eyes Wide Shut&#x27;, and Sam Mendes&#x27;, &#x27;American
Beauty&#x27; &#x97;all from 1999) and this film shows that Fincher is indeed one
of the best filmmakers in the business today.
