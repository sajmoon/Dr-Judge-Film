It takes a great challenge for a movie director to do a remake of a
popular movie, especially when it is based on best selling novel. David
Fincher has taken the challenge to do a remake of the highly popular
Millennium Trilogy, and he did it. He has delivered a splendid American
remake of the Swedish drama series, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.
Daniel Craig takes up the role of Mikael Blomkervist, and Rooney Mara
plays Lisbeth Salander. Together, the trio have given us the feel bad
movie of Christmas.<br /><br />The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo marks the first chapter of Millennium
Trilogy, with Mikael the journalist and Lisbeth, a computer hacker,
working together to investigate the case of a missing girl, Harriet
Vanger. Harriet was believed to be murdered by one of her family member
when she goes missing 40 years ago. At the same time, Mikael is under
trial for defamation of a entrepreneur, while Lisbeth is surviving from
a rape which could have unlikely to happened on her.<br /><br />While Fincher gives a fully explained details in The Curious Case of
Benjamin Button (2009), which was based on a short story written by
F.Scott Fitzgerald, it takes a challenge to summarize a 644 pages story
written by the late Swedish author Stieg Larsson into a 2hr 38 min
movie. Fincher not only did it, but also makes the US remake truly
lives up to the novel. Audience get a better understanding on Lisbeth&#x27;s
lifestyle and attitude towards her surrounding, such as being reserved
at work, living as a bisexual computer hacker, survives from rape and
develops affection on her working partner Mikael. To understand how
Mikael turns Millennium magazine into a magazine that exposes corporate
scandals, it can be seen from the way how he investigates the
disappearance of Harriet Vanger. This is how we see Fincher wants to
tell the audience on the working style for Mikael without repeating
Mikael&#x27;s working style, which was featured at the beginning of the
novel.<br /><br />Editing plays a very important role in this US remake. In the first
half of the movie, Mikael and Lisbeth were presented as two different
persons with very different lifestyle, which goes concurrently without
overlapping each other. Towards the next half of the film, both met
each other by working in the investigation on the disappearance of
Harriet Vanger, which eventually leads to the discovery of the sinister
secrets of the Vanger family. The pace is fast, direct without making
one feeling bored. Rather, it engages the audience, making them wanting
to know more. This is another reason why the movie is a success. What
it lacks, however, is a deeper exploration on Lisbeth&#x27;s personality.
While it was explained in the Swedish version of The Girl With the
Dragon Tattoo, it was not seen in the US remake.<br /><br />In some way, the US remake makes up what was lacking in the Swedish
version. The opening credits are created specially for the US remake,
compared to the usual credits run over on movie scenes. This gives
audience the reason they should arrive the theaters early to catch
them. Observant audience will know that the opening credits covers the
title of the trilogy: a dragon tattoo on the black female body (The
Girl With the Dragon Tattoo), a burning matchstick and a burning body
(The Girl Who Played With Fire) and hornets flying out of a girl&#x27;s
mouth (The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet&#x27;s Nest). The credits are
marvelously accompanied by Karen O, Trent Renzor and Atticus Ross
modern reprise of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s The Immigrant Song.<br /><br />With a marvelous US remake of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, it gives
us the reason to look forward to the US remake of The Girl Who Played
With Fire. Now, all we want is to revisit Mikael and Lisbeth, the
unlikely pair, to unveil more dark secrets.
