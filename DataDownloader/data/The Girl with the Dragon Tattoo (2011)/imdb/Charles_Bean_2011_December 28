This movie was quite exceptionally done. It has a really compelling
story that keeps going deeper and deeper. There isn&#x27;t a whole lot of
action in this but when there is it is explosive. If you like any other
David Fincher movies chances are this will keep you engaged until the
very end. Lots of dialog with a big mystery revolving around the whole
movie. Rooney Mara is amazing at portraying Lisbeth and Daniel Craig is
genius as always. Christopher Plumber has picked another great movie to
act in. In the end this is by far Fincher&#x27;s best film so everyone go
see it and be ready to be disgusted and amazed. I&#x27;m an avid movie
watcher so I know what I&#x27;m talking about.
