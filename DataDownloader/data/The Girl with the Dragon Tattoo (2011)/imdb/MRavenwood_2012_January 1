Swedish Version is Darker and More Violent... but don&#x27;t kid yourself,
the American film *clearly* required a serious edit to pull it under an
X rating for violence alone. I&#x27;m not put off by the way the filmmakers
have presented this material; it is tasteful and not gratuitous.
Sensitive persons will be bothered by the violence and implied violence
against humans and animals, however. The Swedish version has better
costuming for Lisbeth, but it&#x27;s easier to work with the romantic notion
of Daniel Craig&#x27;s Blomkvist. Most importantly, the American ending
leaves in a scene that clearly demonstrates Lisbeth&#x27;s emotional state.
This becomes important for the subsequent stories. For the above two
reasons alone, I would advise viewers to see the American version if
they are only going to bother with one. On style, I prefer the grit and
darkness of the Swedish version. It&#x27;s more noirish. Absolutely not
suitable for kids.
