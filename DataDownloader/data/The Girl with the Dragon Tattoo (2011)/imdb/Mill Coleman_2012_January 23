Reading a bit here, it seems to be a key to enjoying this film is NOT
reading the book or seeing the Swedish movie.<br /><br />This is one very well structured and intense mystery thriller. It
boarders on over-the-top in terms of adult theme but I was riveted and
intrigued every step of the way. The performances are incredible and
Rooney Mara deserves every bit of praise that she has generated for her
portrayal of this complex and troubled character. There are a few logic
flaw moments but they don&#x27;t hinder the film at all. I do like that they
gave us what amounts to a sequel tacked on to the end of the movie.
Once the main plot is resolved, we get a resolution to a secondary plot
that I didn&#x27;t think they would go in to so thoroughly. It was like
watching a later director&#x27;s cut version of the film without having to
wait for the DVD. That&#x27;s what happens when a studio let&#x27;s a big name
director release what he wants, good for them.
