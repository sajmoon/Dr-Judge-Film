A valiant effort to overcome the severe limitations of yet another
unadaptable novel.<br /><br />Fincher is no doubt one of the great directors and yet even he
struggled to come to terms with the unwieldy Scandinavian novel.<br /><br />Brilliantly realized, cast and scored, this is a difficult one to get
into. I so wanted to adore this and yet it proved strangely distancing
and a bit underwhelming. Roone&#xFD; Mara is pretty much exactly as I had
read her in the book. An exotic and autistic mix of precocious devil
and broken ing&#xE9;nue. Interestingly, for such a feminist icon, she does
end up being crassly objectified in her sex scenes, but hey - she
probably comes off quite well in the long run and her career is sorted
now.<br /><br />Daniel Craig is underused and a disappointment but all the other
characters live up to the novel.
