Easily the best performance of Daniel Craig to date. As he also looks a
little Nordic he easily fits in with the surrounding. The movie is dark
and almost as crazy as the books. as we do see a new actress play as
Lisbeth Salander she delivers an award winning performance. Even though
it is around 2 and a half hours it does not feel that long as most of
the supporting cast is also acted very brilliantly. The movie goes very
well with the winter setting of snowy Sweden. The best parts of the
movie other than the performance of Rooney Mara is the cinematography
of the movie and a nice soundtrack to accompany it is. Overall a well
done job I enjoyed it
