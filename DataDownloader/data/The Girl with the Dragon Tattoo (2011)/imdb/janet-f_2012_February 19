Wow, what a disgusting movie. In the theater where I saw it, there were
families with children 3, 4, 5 years old .... In my opinion they should
get free obligatory tattoos saying &#x22;Lousy Parent&#x22;. <br /><br />The person I went with had read the book and so understood the story. I
think the movie-makers did not bother to make a story that actually
fits together and that the viewer can understand. The movie is just an
excuse for showing gross scenes.<br /><br />Key things that the viewer needs to know were not mentioned in the
screenplay. At the beginning of the movie, one of the main characters
is convicted of libel, but we don&#x27;t know whether he wrote a true story
or not. At the end of the movie, the screenwriters may think they told
whether he was vindicated, but I don&#x27;t think they did explain it --
whether this was on purpose or by writing an incoherent script I&#x27;ll
never know.<br /><br />Also, the second primary character is a whiz at hacking computers, but
the screenplay doesn&#x27;t mention that until about halfway through the
movie. If you read the book, you know that she is a computer hacker,
but you don&#x27;t need to see the movie; if you didn&#x27;t read the book, you
are in the dark.<br /><br />During the opening credits the viewer is treated to incomprehensible
visuals which have nothing to do with the plot or with any of the
characters. What&#x27;s with that?<br /><br />Finally, I&#x27;ll avoid giving any spoiler, but the main question raised by
the movie is never answered in any way that makes sense... you simply
cannot tie the pieces together... the script does not contain a story
that could actually work out as the writers show you it did.
