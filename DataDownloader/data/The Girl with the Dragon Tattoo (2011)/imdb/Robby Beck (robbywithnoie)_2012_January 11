It will be nearly impossible for me to give an unbiased, objective
review of this film without bringing any context or personal mumbo
jumbo into it. So I suppose it&#x27;s better that I not even try, and just
talk about this as I see fit.<br /><br />I&#x27;ll first start out by saying I&#x27;m a fanatic of the series of books to
which this is based on, and a modest fan of the Swedish film
adaptations of those books. They weren&#x27;t perfect, but I wouldn&#x27;t call
any of them letdowns - not by a long shot. Naturally though, skepticism
arose when the American adaptation (then thought of as a &#x22;remake&#x22;) was
announced. To me that skepticism was not only called for, it was nearly
essential. I felt as if it could go two ways: it could be a &#x22;Hollywood&#x22;
over simplification of the source material, which would obviously
include shameless censoring of the source&#x27;s graphic sexual violence
(necessity be damned); or it could be a simple carbon copy of the
original film (not unlike another American adaptation of a Swedish
novel/film, Let Me In).<br /><br />Luckily, David Fincher&#x27;s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is neither of
those. The film is not only a more faithful adaptation of the novel,
but it also might be even more brutal and, for some, traumatizing than
the Swedish original.<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is the story of Mikael Blomkvist, a
journalist whose reputation had been squandered by a libel suit, who is
hired to solve a 40+ year-old mystery with the aid of the title
character, the asocial Lisbeth Salander. The Girl with the Dragon
Tattoo, as a novel, is of a story and style that is unmistakeably
Swedish; from the pacing, to the seemingly endless cramming-in of
detail, to Sweden&#x27;s government system working its own way into the plot
progression, Sweden is as essential to the novel as any character, plot
progression, theme, what have you. It would be a crime to Americanize
the story, in both setting and style. Fincher and screenwriter Steven
Zaillian made the correct decision of keeping the setting of Sweden and
simply having the characters&#x27; language masked by English. For some this
can be confusing, as the Swedish guardianship system that Lisbeth
Salander is under is never fully explained in the film as it is in the
books; however if you pay attention, and just go with it, I think
you&#x27;ll get the hang of it just fine.<br /><br />Speaking of Salander, Rooney Mara is exceptional in the role. She shows
a side of vulnerability and fear that is locked away in Lisbeth, more
so, I think, than Noomi Rapace did nearly three years ago. As far as
the other, less noted protagonist of the film Mikael Blomkvist, the
casting of Daniel Craig was yet another source of skepticism for me; I
simply couldn&#x27;t think of him being able to pull off Blomkvist in his
more sensitive and vulnerable moments. However, Craig shines as
brightly as Mara, and the two sport a chemistry equal to that of the
leading man and woman in the Swedish film.<br /><br />Even at a length exceeding two and a half hours, I couldn&#x27;t find myself
bored with this film once. Humorous dialogue exchanges are perfectly
timed to give us a break from the tension when needed, and those
moments never feel tacked on. This film successfully brings me back
into the world of the Millennium trilogy in a way that not even the
Swedish film could; though I feel that to still be excellent, Fincher&#x27;s
adaptation has more breathing room, and I feel as if I&#x27;m seeing this
bleak universe unfold before my eyes. I love this film, and ultimately
the book series, for the same reasons that I love shows like Twin Peaks
or Breaking Bad; they&#x27;re dark, ominous, kinda messed up, but at the
same time, enthralling and ridiculously entertaining. It is, without a
doubt, one of the most exhilarating viewing experiences I&#x27;ve had this
year.
