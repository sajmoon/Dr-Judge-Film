The only thing that made me go see this movie was to simply compare it
with the Swedish version. OK, in term of special effects, camera
angles, you know setup, this movie is way better but then if you
compare the thriller in this one with the original version I think that
this version is way under. I&#x27;m not saying, like I&#x27;ve seen here, that
you should definitely see this one because of Daniel Craig&#x27;s acting, or
just give you the classic stereotype &#x22;oldies but goldies&#x22; regarding the
Swedish version. I&#x27;m just saying that if a movie is born in some
culture, Nordic in this case, you should at least let go of the
American felling when you rate it. For me even the Swedish accent makes
it more mysterious and more thrilling than this one. But both are great
and if you&#x27;ve seen it with Daniel Craig you should also try it with
Michael Nyqvist.
