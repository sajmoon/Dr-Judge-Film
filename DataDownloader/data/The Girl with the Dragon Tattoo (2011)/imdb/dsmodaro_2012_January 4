I read the book, all three in fact, and saw all three foreign made
movies. First, I was bored to tears with the American version of &#x22;The
Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#x22;. Daniel Craig was the worst pick to play
Mikael Blomkvist(Russell Crowe would have been the best) with Rooney
Mara doing a fair impersonation of Noomi Rapace&#x27;s performance in the
foreign made film. Second, the flash bang aspects of the film overrode
the more subtle aspects of the story and if I had not read the book, I
would not have recognized the plot at all. Third, too many changes from
the original storyline were made. Why? To satisfy the director&#x27;s time
constraints, literary license, or both? In summary, I was disappointed
with the film and I will wait to see any sequels on DVD rather than pay
top dollar to see them in the theater.
