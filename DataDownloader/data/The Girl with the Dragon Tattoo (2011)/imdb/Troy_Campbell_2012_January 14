Those that thought David Fincher couldn&#x27;t pull off the impossible &#x96;
creating a worthy remake of the much loved Swedish Dragon Tattoo only
two years after it itself was released &#x96; thought wrong. Fincher has
added another indelibly powerful body of work to his already amazing
CV; somewhere above Panic Room and Benjamin Button but slightly below
Zodiac, Seven, Fight Club and The Social Network. With a tone-setting
opening credits sequence &#x96; one of the best I&#x27;ve ever witnessed &#x96; and a
darkly atmospheric score by regular collaborators Trent Reznor and
Atticus Finch, the U.S. TGWTDT is an unrelenting and intense thriller
that had me on the edge of my seat despite knowing the bulk of the
narrative twists and turns (some of which have been altered from the
original). But what of the cast you ask? Well, comparing the new and
old portrayals of the titular inked female &#x96; by Rooney Mara and Noomi
Rapace respectively &#x96; doesn&#x27;t generate a clear winner, only how
different they actually are. Where Rapace played it physically
stronger, mentally clearer and emotionally detached, Mara is less
physically imposing, mentally weaker but emotionally more in control.
Daniel Craig on the other hand is a much more engaging Blomkvist than
Michael Nyqvist, and, most importantly, the chemistry he shares with
Mara is more convincing and tangible than that of the Swede duo. This
really is the &#x22;feel bad movie of the year&#x22; that the posters suggested
thanks to the impressive cast and crew, and one that will have both
fans and newcomers enthralled.
