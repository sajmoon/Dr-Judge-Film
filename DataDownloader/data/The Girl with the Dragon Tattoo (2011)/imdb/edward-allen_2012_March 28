A strong cast, all apart from Daniel Craig, who can only play one type,
movie after movie (that of a wooden sideboard)<br /><br />The first movie is far more edgy, exciting and authentic. This revised
version is typical Hollywood; over produced, over simplified and over
hyped. You can tell its been through a 1000 different hands, and that
for all the money spent what they ended up with just does not capture
the feel of the book (and doesn&#x27;t follow it at all well either!)<br /><br />Stellan Skarsg&#xE5;rd, Rooney Mara &#x26; Grandfather Plummer do produce
excellent performances (with Grandpa doing a great Swedish accent.
speaking of which why was Daniel Craig unable to handle the accent? Oh
yes, he can&#x27;t act I forgot!
