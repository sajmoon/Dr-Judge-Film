Director David Fincher&#x27;s &#x22;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#x22; is amazing.
Rooney Mara is awesome as the Girl with the tattoo. She is a star. Mara
inhabits Stieg Larsson&#x27;s anti-hero hero Lisbeth Salander. &#x22;The Girls
with the Dragon Tattoo&#x22; is one of the best movies of the year. My bud
Neil cautioned me that the movie is 2 hours and 40 minutes, and slow in
the beginning&#x97;to set up the context, and worth it. Daniel Craig is
unrecognizably physically vulnerable and compelling as Mikael. I think
Craig is the most threatening physical presence as James Bond; this is
distinct contrast. He plays the tarnished writer seeking redemption,
researching a 40 year-old murder of the cryptically dysfunctional
Vanger family. Jeff Cronenweth&#x27;s striking cinematography captures the
existential bleakness. Trent Reznor&#x27;s innovative score lyrically
balances the foreboding narrative.<br /><br />Fincher gravitates toward the darker lurid human crevices. I squirmed
watching his shockingly explicit sodomy scene. This derives from the
source material. From one point of view, the pivotal character arc for
Lisbeth forges familiar rage and calculated retribution. &#x22;The Girl with
the Dragon Tattoo&#x22; gleans on the surface unsavory&#x97;serial murder, and
the aftermath of physical and sexual abuse. I was initially puzzled by
Fincher&#x27;s remake of movies based on Larsson&#x27;s novels which were
acclaimed. Fincher triumphs and his vision warranted. He exquisitely
underlies the virtue of humanity amidst its brutal inhumanity.<br /><br />Set in the austere winter of Stockholm, Lisbeth is the tortured Goth
savant researcher on retainer to an international security firm. Mara
with Lisbeth&#x27;s facial and body piercings, tattoos, and spiked black
hair is not your typical corporate researcher. She is the genius biker
computer hacker with both photographic and auditory memory. Fincher has
subtle reveal as Lisbeth memorizes the door security code as she
strolls by an apartment.<br /><br />Fincher, Mara and Steven Zaillian&#x27;s screenplay hint at the haunting
possible abuse that shrouds Lisbeth&#x27;s past&#x97;she suppresses great fear
and anger displaying compartmentalized focus. In a glimpse into her
rage, Lisbeth brutally beats a robber with her kickboxing skills. I
have been watching a lot of Dr. Drew. Apparently, a ward of the state,
Lisbeth is a loner spending her time eating micro-waved cup noodles,
while immersed in her cyber research tasks. One of those subjects was
Mikael (Craig). Though apparent recluse, Lisbeth seeks out both men and
women as lovers. Mara is magnetic. Lisbeth had a beloved guardian, who
suffered a stroke. Her current guardian is creepy attorney Bjurman
(Yorick van Wageningen), who leverages appalling favors from Lisbeth to
access her family money.<br /><br />Mikael Blomkvist (Craig) is the disgraced financial journalist losing a
libel case and his fortune to businessman Wennerstrom (slick charming
Ulf Friberg). He is co-owner of Millennium magazine with his lover
Erika Berger (strong Robin Wright)&#x97;both are married, to other partners.
He has a grown daughter. Mikael resigns. Meanwhile, Frode (menacing
Steven Berkoff), the family attorney for Henrik Vanger (Christopher
Plummer), patriarch of Vanger Industries, contacts Mikael with a
curious offer. Plummer is brilliantly controlling and charismatic as
the suffering Henrik. Every year he receives a pressed flower from
anonymous sender. His niece Harriet had always sent him this gift;
however, he believes she was murdered over 40 years ago when she
vanished in 1966. She was 16 years old. Henrik wants Mikael to find the
person, who murdered Harriet, who he believes is family. In return, he
will pay handsomely and give Mikael critical information. Harriet&#x27;s
brother Martin (icy cool Stellan Skarsgard) is the smart and measured
man, who is now CEO of Vanger Industries. Mikael lives in a cottage on
the Vanger estate on Hedeby Island and operates under the guise of
writing a Vanger biography. Mikael soon discovers the depth of the
Vanger family dysfunction.<br /><br />Frode ironically connects Mikael with Lisbeth to further his research
which is at an impasse. They know their own personal connection. Mikael
says, &#x22;I want you to help me catch a killer of women.&#x22; Their lives
intersect and the twisted journey spirals down the dark path.
Thankfully, there is light. Rooney Mara is powerful as the broken hero.
Daniel Craig is amazing as the compassionate partner. Mara and Craig
are such amazing actors, who capture fear, sadness, and surprise in
their eyes. David Fincher tells the hero&#x27;s story with graceful triumphs
and muted losses. &#x22;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#x22; is awesome.
