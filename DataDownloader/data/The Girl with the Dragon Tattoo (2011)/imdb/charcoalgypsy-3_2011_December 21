Having read all the books, and watched the Swedish versions of the
films, I could not be happier with Fincher&#x27;s film. It is spot on. That
je ne sais quoi of the stunning and the subdued in harmony, that is so
difficult to achieve, but so necessary to film like this, is flawlessly
executed.<br /><br />I think Reznor was an excellent choice for the soundtrack, and he did a
phenomenal job. I never felt as if the music was out of place or
intrusive.<br /><br />There are a few story changes, but ultimately they make for a better
movie. I&#x27;m sorry to have to disagree with those of you who prefer the
Swedish films, and think the first Swedish film is better. The
cinematography in Oplev&#x27;s version is excellent, the acting is first
rate, but ultimately the film is a disappointment. It is incoherent,
and oftentimes jarring. Had I not read the books before watching
Oplev&#x27;s version, I would not have been able to follow it. Fincher&#x27;s
film is nearly perfect. Every change has a purpose and benefits the
film.<br /><br />It goes without saying, Rooney Mara is absolutely amazing. But I also
thought Daniel Craig was an unexpected, and wonderful, choice. For
those who claim Mara outshined him, yes, she did, and no, she didn&#x27;t.
Who is the shocking, scene-stealing, surprising one? Salander? Or
Blomkvist? Craig played his part true to the novel. He is a subdued
fellow. He is not dramatic. He is never over-the-top. He does not
brood. What were you people expecting? Craig was Blomkvist. Had he
acted any differently, it would have changed the story, and not for the
better.<br /><br />Whether you have read the novels or not, see the film. It will bash you
over the head on the one hand, and slowly seep into you on the other. I
still can&#x27;t stop thinking about it.
