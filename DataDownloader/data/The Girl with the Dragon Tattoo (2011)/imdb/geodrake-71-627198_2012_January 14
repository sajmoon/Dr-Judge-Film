Not having read the books or seen the Swedish movie I didn&#x27;t bring any
preconceptions or my own opinions on the plot with me to the cinema
when I saw this. The opening credits are ludicrously over the top -
full of C.G.I. writhing figures that would be more fitting for an
action blockbuster. Daniel Craig does a decent job as Blomkvist,
however like the rest of the characters, we never feel that there&#x27;s
much below the surface. They exist to tell the story rather than to be
absorbing personalities. Even Rooney Mara&#x27;s Lisbeth isn&#x27;t more than a
well sculptured shell to hang a narrative on. I think this has more to
do with the source material than the adaptation. Christopher Plumber
gives the best performance as Henrik Vanger, which given his veteran
status as an actor is no surprise. The plot starts off briskly and as
the murder investigation gathers pace, it does draw you in. Keeping
track of all the players takes concentration as there are lots of
Vanger relatives hanging around to provide suspects. Lisbeth&#x27;s sub plot
regarding her status as a ward of the state and taking revenge on the
guardian who rapes her was deftly handled but I felt it didn&#x27;t add much
to the overall story. Her sexual relationship with Blomkvist seemed
unlikely and unnecessary though. After the vaguely unsatisfying
revelation of the killer&#x27;s identity (again, this is the fault of the
plot source) my interest waned when Lisbet goes after the tycoon
responsible to Blomkvist&#x27;s downfall at the beginning of the film. This
is worth seeing but not worth the hype. I suspect the &#x27;Millenium
Trilogy&#x27; books are fast paced but lack any interesting literary
technique.
