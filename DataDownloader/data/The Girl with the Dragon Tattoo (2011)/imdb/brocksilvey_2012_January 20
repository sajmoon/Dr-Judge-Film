I&#x27;ve not read the book on which David Fincher&#x27;s newest movie is based,
and after seeing the adaptation I certainly don&#x27;t want to. For it&#x27;s
obvious, even to someone who hasn&#x27;t read it, that Fincher and company
are fighting an up-hill battle against borderline terrible material.<br /><br />That material is all about perversion, sadism, torture, murder, and
it&#x27;s particularly occupied with all of the horrible ways in which men
can victimize women. It&#x27;s the kind of story in which the serial killer
gets caught and then delivers a lengthy soliloquy directly to the main
protagonist so that the audience can be bluntly told what the writer
wasn&#x27;t creative enough to tell us in any other way and another
character can swoop in in the nick of time and stop the serial killer
from killing our hero.<br /><br />But Fincher&#x27;s talents as a director are considerable, as are those of
his cast, and the film is pretty entertaining up to a point. But it
goes of for far too long, there are one too many story lines, and the
material becomes too preposterous to bear. What the film has going for
it is the performance of Rooney Mara, sensational as the titular
character. Though the film treats her character like crap, Mara herself
is hypnotic and carries the film, no small feat given that she by no
means has the most screen time (that honor belongs to Daniel Craig,
also very good). The incessant violence against women is hard to take
after a point -- the story isn&#x27;t smart enough to make any commentary
about that violence, so it just comes to feel uncomfortably gratuitous.<br /><br />One bit of unequivocal praise I can offer this film -- I doubt I will
see as kick-ass an opening credits sequence in any other movie this
year.<br /><br />Grade: B
