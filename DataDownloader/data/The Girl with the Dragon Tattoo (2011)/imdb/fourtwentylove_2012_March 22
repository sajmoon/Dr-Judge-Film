A lot of story was left out. I don&#x27;t know how people who haven&#x27;t read
the book or seen the previous version made sense of what was going on.<br /><br />The graphics are better and the Trent Reznor music was a plus. But it
really lacks depth. The director basically ripped off the other version
and added more special effects. That&#x27;s it.<br /><br />I also didn&#x27;t really buy Lizabeth&#x27;s character. She is way to angry,
much more so than she was in the book. She did actually have
relationships with other people (hacker&#x27;s, her lesbian friend etc). <br /><br />Read the books. They are amazing. You don&#x27;t even get the back story of
her relationship with her father, brother and why the Vangaurds are
really even interested in Bloomkvist. That and they showed an
unnecessarily graphic dead cat.
