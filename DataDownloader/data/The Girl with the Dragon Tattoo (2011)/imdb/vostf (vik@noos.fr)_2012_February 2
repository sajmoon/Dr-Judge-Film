WAY BETTER THAN THE FIRST ADAPTATION I was amazed that people thought
so much of the original adaptation. It was clearly not a good movie
(caveat: I saw the TV version in two parts which is longer than the
movie but still feels rushed and disjointed). Whatever you think of
that Scandinavian movie you can&#x27;t seriously say the main character,
Mikael Blomqvist, was magnificently embodied. The actor had zero
charisma, he felt so boring you couldn&#x27;t buy he was passionate about
his work (and women - and in turn his sex appeal was questionable).
Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander was good but not great and you could
feel it was for lack of top-class directing skills in the Danish
film-brewer.<br /><br />FAITHFUL TO THE BOOK Actually the first book in the Millennium trilogy
is such a good thriller - it is really a top-tier page-turner that
deserved to become a best-seller - that the story (featuring Lisbeth
Salander as the most engaging character) is enough to have people feel
they are watching something original, thus good.<br /><br />Stephen Zaillian&#x27;s adaptation really does justice to the book and we
really have to congratulate the producers and director David Fincher
for not shortening significant parts of the original story. At over
2h30 the story is never slow, neither rushed. Most importantly Daniel
Craig is a perfect Mikael Blomqvist (and I admit I don&#x27;t like him as
007), Rooney Mara feels more fragile than Noomi Rapace and is thus much
more touching.<br /><br />I am not a great fan of David Fincher but now his visual gusto is
matched by great scripts (well, he earned that through lesser works I
think) he does wonders. Clearly here you can tell the production sense
and values were perfectly in tune with the original material, plus
Fincher shoots the perfect pace, the perfect emotional tone as he
directs Craig and Mara (and the supporting cast as well) to hit the
high marks.<br /><br />Sole big blunder: an over-bloated and totally out-of-line opening
credits sequence. This is not a super-hero movie or a saw gruesome
horror flick: clearly here less - much less - would have been more.
Credits displayed over an extended presentation of Mikael Blomqvist
(possibly thru Salander&#x27;s private eye) would have been way better. The
fact is the only unfaithful bit is the English title (chosen by
publishers) but there was really no urge to make it that explicit so
soon in the movie.<br /><br />Now I am expecting a lot from Millennium II - The Girl who played with
Fire. The book was boring, long digressions and obvious suspense with a
multi-pronged investigation stalled for pages. Here the movie can even
be better than the book, too bad they didn&#x27;t shot it back-to-back with
the first movie.
