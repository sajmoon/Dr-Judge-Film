although i agree to some extent with the generally accepted critique of
the final act and that of the source material, i found myself
completely engaged and involved. the vision of Stieg Larsson&#x27;s work
through the eyes of David Fincher marks the return of his dirty minded
leanings under the guise of beautiful, pale images and ominous
atmosphere. accompanied by a rather inhospitable decoration to the
environment, everything that takes place on the island is of precise
darkness/coldness (literally translated in the lack of a heating
instrument in Mikael&#x27;s residence). The film is largely built around
contrasts: Mikael/Lisbeth, Stockholm/Island, present/past,
youth/wisdom.. there&#x27;s also the supposed similarities between Harriet&#x27;s
past of abuse and trauma and that of Lisbeth, helping to expand on the
story of the investigation and giving hinted insight into Lisbeth (a
fascinating character). the film adopts a consistent parallel narrative
between Mikael and Lisbeth, that is a great model of precision and
tempo; This is to delimit two distinct sides that are continuing to
attract before joining in and creating a second parallel story that
will maintain the narrative to the end (using a technique of
voice-overs spilling into scenes that follow).<br /><br />there&#x27;s a lot to say and admire in Fincher&#x27;s assured and matured
technique and plot devices. same goes for the performances, especially
Rooney Mara. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo captures something
essential in its too main characters, and ultimately makes Lisbeth a
compelling cross between a guardian angel and an angel of death;
humanized.
