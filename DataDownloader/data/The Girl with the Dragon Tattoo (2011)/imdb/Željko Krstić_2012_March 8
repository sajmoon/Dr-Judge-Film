I was so eager to see this movie, because I saw Swedish original.<br /><br />It is, I don&#x27;t know, sad, because a lot of English speaking people
(UK/US) is not common with reading subtitles and then they did not see
the original.<br /><br />Comparing leading actresses is nonsense. Noomi Rapace made it look like
she is Lizbeth in private life. Rooney Mara was not even close. I
really do not understand how she got nominated for the Oscar.<br /><br />Whole movie atmosphere in Swedish original is so much better shown.<br /><br />Sincerely, I hope there will be no remakes of two remaining parts of
Millennium trilogy.
