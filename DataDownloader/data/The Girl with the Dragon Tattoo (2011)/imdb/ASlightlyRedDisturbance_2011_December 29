I&#x27;m a big fan of David Fincher. All of the 5 films I have seen from him
range from great (Se7en) to masterful (The Social Network, Fight Club).
However, when I learned he was doing another version of the Swedish
original based on a novel, I wasn&#x27;t exactly thrilled. Having never read
the novel, I could only base it on the Swedish original, and that one
never rose above just good. The story sounds great, it just never left
me really hooked. Fincher&#x27;s version accomplished more with the same
source material.<br /><br />The opening sequence of the film is excellent, as everyone has already
said. It&#x27;s the best opening of the year. Then we follow Michael
Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander. Very similar to the Swedish version,
but also executed differently. Basically, pretty much what one would
expect from Fincher, although there is a big difference. I expected a
very cold atmosphere, and that same atmosphere although works can also
be off- putting. Yet, while the film does have that, it also plays a
lot with different colors. It&#x27;s atmosphere stands out from the Swedish
version&#x27;s, and overall it&#x27;s much more involving and thrilling. The
different settings changed in the film, as well as some of the
interactions and such. This version is more thrilling.<br /><br />Then we have Rooney Mara. I had expected good from her, and then I
heard raves for her performance. Yet, I didn&#x27;t really see her expanding
on what Rapace did. Somehow, she&#x27;s given more material to work with,
and she expands on the complexities and the hidden feelings that her
character has. This is an excellent performance, and she managed to
surprise me with how much she does with just a still face. It&#x27;s even in
the small moments as well. Daniel Craig is a more investing protagonist
than the one from the Swedish version, and he did more than I had
expected him to. He shows many vulnerabilities that I didn&#x27;t expect.<br /><br />One of the major differences is the ending of this and the ending of
the other version. The way this version revealed the truth about the
prime antagonist and about Harriet was handled much better here, but it
has some problems in the final 20 minutes. After the big climax is
over, it takes too long to wrap things up. Fincher&#x27;s version doesn&#x27;t
add any ambiguities. One of my favorite aspects of the Swedish original
was the way that lisbeth ends the attacker, and a conflict between how
she handled it and how Michael wanted it to end. Here, all of that is
removed. I was disappointed in this. Also, this version adds more to
the ending of what Lisbeth is doing undercover. I thought this worked
well. I have not seen the other two films based on the trilogy, but I
felt that this version handled it in a good, but different way. And the
final scene, surprisingly, worked. I wouldn&#x27;t have thought it could if
reading it on paper, but it did. <br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent film. It doesn&#x27;t really do anything out
of the ordinary, and when looked at is pretty simple and
straight-forward, but in that respect it works. Many will find this
structure solid, if unexciting, but it adds to the richness of the
characters. I loved it for even more reasons I can&#x27;t explain, and I do
think it&#x27;s better than the Swedish film.
