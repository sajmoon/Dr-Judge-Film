First of all, why does Daniel Craig keep his British accent while
everyone else in the movie does a Swedish accent? This gives the movie
an Englishman in Sweden feel, instead of a wholly Swedish story feel.
Maybe Daniel Craig got dropped into the movie at the last minute and
maybe for that reason also, he never manages to quite capture Blomkvist
properly, he&#x27;s not the tired, financially ruined reporter whose career
has just been destroyed escaping his problems, but he comes off as an
strong, athletic, physical presence, headstrong and determined.<br /><br />I admit that I finished reading the book right before seeing the movie
and probably for that reason the movie felt more like a PBS
re-enactment of the book rather than a feature film. The movie felt
like it lacked style and when it did apply style, it felt grossly out
of tone. For example, the James Bondesque opening &#x22;immigrant song&#x22;
sequence which seems hardly appropriate for a sleepy murder mystery
that aims to explore themes of sexual sadism, Nazism, anti-Semitism
etc.<br /><br />The original book is not without its faults, while brilliant in places
the author filled in gaps with tripe. Nothing characterizes this more
than Lisbeth which the author Larsson made into an Asperger&#x27;s syndrome
inflicted super-intelligent super-human. The movie version of Lisbeth
is sexy and cool but cartoonish. There is no effort to elucidate
Lisbeth and her actions, she just is cool and smart and that is all we
get about her.<br /><br />Having read the book probably puts me in a different category than a
large portion of the audience for the movie. While it&#x27;s never possible
to tell a 400-page plus novel in a three hour movie, I really wished
for style and focus rather than a quick retelling of the story. It&#x27;s
disappointing that the movie just aims to tell the story rather than
take risks and explore themes and ambiances while visually telling the
story. Finally as a side note, for those who read the book, the movie
version eliminates the Australian sheep station, which leads to a
change in the tone of certain characters from the book.
