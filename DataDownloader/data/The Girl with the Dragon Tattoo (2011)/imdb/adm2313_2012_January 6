Saw both films and read the trilogy.<br /><br />I was skeptical adaptation about a Hollywood adaptation of the novel
after having seen the Swedish film and loving it. However, Fincher has
crafted a film that is outstanding in its own right.<br /><br />And after falling in love with Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander I
didn&#x27;t think that I could see anyone else in the role, but Mara nails
it and creates an interpretation of Salander all her own.<br /><br />I wouldn&#x27;t say that Blomkvist as played by Daniel Craig is better, but
the novels continually describe how handsome the character is and how
many women he beds. I never believed that Michael Nyqvist inhabited
those aspects of the character even though his performance in all other
areas was admirable. Craig as Blomkvist does possess a charisma that
his Swedish counterpart did not.<br /><br />Hopefully this film will perform well, as I would like to see this team
continue with adaptations of the rest of the trilogy.
