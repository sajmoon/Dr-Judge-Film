Lisbeth!! What is best in life!? I just finished reading the trilogy
and this morning figured out that this movie series will be a better
remake of Conan the Barbarian than the actual remake of Conan the
Barbarian. Conan and Lisbeth each have their lives take a serious wrong
turn at an early age. About a decade later opportunities arise to quest
after a longed for revenge. In the process, each in their own way,
becomes the most ferociously powerful hacker of their age. When Lisbeth
cracks open a Macbook Pro I know that somebody somewhere is going to
get cleaved fully in half, as sure as if Mr Olympia went totally
berserk with a razor sharp broadsword. She even gets the opportunity to
do some damage with an ax in true Barbarian style. Each communicates
with dirty looks and mono-syllables if there is any anything
communicated at all. All this silence and brooding is what was missing
from the new Conan. It&#x27;s like some black hole of hate, nothing escapes
- especially not small talk. You should look at Lisbath/Conan and feel
that here is someone who can destroy you at will. You will never ever
get on Lisbeth/Conan&#x27;s good side, don&#x27;t even try.
