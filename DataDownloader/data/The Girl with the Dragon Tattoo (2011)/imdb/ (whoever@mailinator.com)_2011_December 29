In this movie, there&#x27;s a kick-ass lady shaped like a model who: - not
only knows how to handle firearms like an expert, - she also ride a
black motorbike with a &#x27;cool&#x27; helmet - she fights thugs on the subway 3
times her size - hacks phone lines, computers, police records using a
mac and some &#x27;magic&#x27; box her mate gave her - survives a violent rape
only to have mad sex later on with Daniel Craig - is some sort of
genius with a photographic memory.<br /><br />Look, it was entertaining popcorn, but it wasn&#x27;t the work of art
everyone on this site is making it to be. Think &#x27;swordfish&#x27; meet your
usual james patterson novel and you have this.
