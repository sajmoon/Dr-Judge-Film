I have seen the Swedish film, now this English speaking version, but
never read the book. At first I was reluctant to see this version, as I
enjoyed the Swedish one, but David Fincher was enough to convince me it
would be worth a try.<br /><br />There were a few standout points, namely the style and cinematography.
It really is a wonderful film to look at, and has Fincher&#x27;s acclaimed
attention to detail throughout. He really has put a lot of work into
this, and it shows. And with this type of story, it is hard to think of
a current day director that would be more suitable. The opening credits
are also worthy of a mention. It&#x27;s like watching a Chris Cunningham
music video, spawned from the mind of H.R. Giger. Not sure if it gels
with the film entirely, but was impossible to look away. The score also
is one of the best points. Trent Reznor does a magnificent job,
creating a mood and intensifying a scene. Combined with a well produced
sound design, it is great for the ears. As for performances, I thought
Daniel Craig came across well.<br /><br />Whilst watching this film and since leaving the cinema, I have found it
impossible to not compare this English version to its Swedish
predecessor. Even when consciously trying to watch it with a clean
slate, you can&#x27;t help but consider comparisons. So with that in mind, I
have found Fincher&#x27;s version to be a disappointment. I did not get
hooked in at all, and as great as it was for the eyes, I was urging the
credits to roll.<br /><br />Firstly the character Lisbeth Salander played by Rooney Mara. I thought
she was so much less engaging than Noomi Rapace&#x27;s portrayal. At times I
actually found her character to be quite overstated in certain
scenarios, particularly the over-choreographed bag snatch scene on the
escalator. With Noomi&#x27;s version, there was an eerie undercurrent and
imperfection to her character, whereas with Rooney&#x27;s, being bad seems
too perfect in its execution. This type of overproducing, and trying so
hard to make it sleek, really took away from the realism of the
characters and more importantly the story. With the Swedish one it was
gritty, dark, and real. They were far from perfect characters in
situations out of their depth. With Fincher&#x27;s version, the characters
tend to feel too exaggerated.<br /><br />The narrative also was slow at times, then way too quick at others
points. For example it&#x27;s partly a study of Lisbeth Salander and Mikael
Blomkvist current lives for the first half hour to an hour, and does
tend to drag. Even still, you learn nothing as to why Lisbeth is the
way she is. So they don&#x27;t know each other, then bang, they are working
together. We do see how they get introduced, but the processed is
rushed through. I remember the way they come across each other in the
Swedish version as being rather important and enjoyable to watch
unfold. Their relationship in the Swedish version also grew in a
believable sense, and was genuine, however with this English version,
it seems so forced. Especially the intimate scenes, they just seem to
occur for no good reason. They are quickly squeezed in, then back to
the mystery.<br /><br />If you haven&#x27;t seen the Swedish version, Fincher&#x27;s version would
probably satisfy. It may be closer to the book, this I am unsure. And
perhaps Rooney Mara&#x27;s turn at Lisbeth Salander would impress. But for
me, I have to recommend the original Swedish film by a long way. I
think the script has a lot to answer for here as it seems unbalanced,
and even with a long duration, it still feels like there are important
points that are left out or glossed over. I know it can be somewhat
clich&#xE9; to state it, especially in a scenario such as this, but I can&#x27;t
help but think that in a lot of ways this story has been distorted by
the Hollywood system. The product placement is a testament to that, and
as for the Nine Inch Nails shirt, for some reason it annoyed me more
than it ever should (surely Reznor didn&#x27;t suggest this?). Nevertheless
his contribution was worthy of note, and Fincher has made a good
looking film here, and really undertaken a courageous act in making
this story around two years after the highly successful Swedish
version. The comparisons were always going to be part and parcel of how
this version was received. Unfortunately, for me, it just does not come
close.
