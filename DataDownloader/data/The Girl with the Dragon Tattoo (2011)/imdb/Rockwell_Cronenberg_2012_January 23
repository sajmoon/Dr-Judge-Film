I wish that I could write up a long review elaborately explaining the
things that I disliked about this film, but honestly it just comes down
to the fact that I found it very dull. There&#x27;s a little stretch in the
middle where I was mildly interested by it, but the large majority was
just a tedious experience for me. I wasn&#x27;t on board with the tone that
David Fincher was trying to achieve, mostly because I felt that there
was no tone to it. I don&#x27;t really understand what happened here, but it
honestly felt like there wasn&#x27;t a shred of enthusiasm from anyone
involved. It felt like none of them really wanted to be there and they
were just phoning it in.<br /><br />I&#x27;m a pretty large Fincher fan and was devastated by the utter lack of
innovative style here. Even in his big misses like Panic Room, he&#x27;s
always been a director who can at least make things look good even if
the overall product isn&#x27;t so much, but here I didn&#x27;t feel any of
Fincher&#x27;s technical prowess on display. The score by Trent Reznor and
Atticus Ross, whose work in Social Network I loved in it&#x27;s
unconventional appropriateness, felt totally out of place here and
really grated on me quickly.<br /><br />With that slick, well-designed opening credits sequence accompanied by
the very impressive cover of &#x22;Immigrant Song&#x22;, I thought this was going
to be a pretty exhilarating journey but two hours and forty minutes
later I realized that those opening credits were the best thing about
the film. For me, it was just an uninvolved exercise in needlessness. I
thought that Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara had a decent bit of chemistry
together as actors, which made their few scenes together slightly less
unbearable, but Mara&#x27;s performance as a whole is one of the big
disappointments of the year. It was all visuals with no soul.<br /><br />Mara made the part look right but that&#x27;s all she did; it&#x27;s an
impressively aesthetic work with nothing going on underneath. Perhaps
she&#x27;s just not an experienced enough actor yet, because on a technical
level she did everything right but she didn&#x27;t let the character breathe
at all. She focused too much on getting all of the appearances right,
but wasn&#x27;t capable of truly sinking into the character beyond that.
Overall it&#x27;s pretty firm in it&#x27;s standing as the biggest disappointment
of the year for me. There was nothing offensively bad about it, but
nothing to praise or really remember either (except maybe Daniel
Craig&#x27;s wardrobe, which was excellent). I feel like by tomorrow I&#x27;ll
have completely forgotten about it, which will be a blessing.
