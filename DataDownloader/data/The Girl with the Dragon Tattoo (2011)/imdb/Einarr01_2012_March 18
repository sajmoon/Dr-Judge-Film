I was quite enthusiastic about seeing this title, thinking that
Hollywood did make a successful remake this time around. God I was so
terribly wrong. The movie starts with an intro in an extremely
trying-to-look-artsy way, that is so much more than simply boring, than
it shouts &#x22;uninspired&#x22;. Yet I sat back, thinking that I haven&#x27;t seen
the real thing yet, thus I must not be all that critical from the
beginning. What a mistake. As usual for an American remake, this one is
not an exception. The acting by both Craig and Mara was extremely
uninspired, just like the intro of the movie, that I mentioned above. I
must admit that they did make the effort to actually go and shoot the
&#x22;thing&#x22;, meaning the movie in Sweden (yet I failed to understand why
did they show the Swedish news in English though). Apart from that
Craig looks kind of lost in his part, while Mara&#x27;s way of recreating
Lisbeth was so, so plain. Overall the movie was a huge disappointment
for me, yet so boring, I did even fall asleep, right before the
hours-mark, when I actually stopped even bothering myself watching it
further more. If you did like the novel, or have somehow heard nice
things about the original( or even about the remake) just try not
torturing yourself with it, but instead go for the real thing. Rapace
does pull off an Award winning performance in the original, while the
whole movie itself is not to be even compared to the remake whatsoever.
