If you have read the books (which I highly recommend you do), you will
most likely hate this film. Major aspects of the story are changed,
including the ending which is entirely different (for seemingly no
reason other than to reduce length of the film) to the book - and this
itself causes a huge plot inaccuracy. Also, we are given a significant
clue as to who is the murderer very early on in the film. What is the
point!? The character of Salander is destroyed by the director. She
opens up way too much and shows a significant amount of emotional
weakness, which we shouldn&#x27;t see until the next film at least. The film
artistry itself is hugely lacking. We are under the illusion that it is
a film of incredible beauty and depth. I&#x27;m afraid not, this is just the
Swedish countryside - possibly the only good thing about this film. We
are soon met by lack-lustre screenplay writing and subsequently
unnatural and contrived scenes with every character. I&#x27;m not easily
offended but the unnecessary use of swear words (where no normal person
would use them) and lengthy portrayal of rape and sex in this film was
just not called for. It is awkward and a huge indulgence on the
director&#x27;s part. Stick with the original Swedish version if you want
good, solid, artistic film making. And please stop praising this
blasphemous nightmare of a film.
