To start off this review I am going to point out that I have seen the
original Swedish version and I am not going to compare the two. A lot
of people have given this movie bad reviews based on that it did not
live up to the original, and that no one could ever live up to Naomi
Rapace. Yes the original is an amazing picture and Rapace does give a
mesmerizing performance but I have to say this movie not only lives up
to the original&#x85;. but surpasses it.<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has got to be one of the best films of
2011. From the opening shots that give you the most fascinating visuals
and playing against the &#x27;Immigrant Song&#x27; Covered by Karen O, you know
you are in for one amazing movie experience.<br /><br />Rooney Mara gives her best performance to date, nominated for an Oscar
for best actress in a leading role that she defiantly deserves. Mara&#x27;s
portrayal of the title character, Lisbeth Salander is so compelling it
gave me goosebumps. You should go see the movie just own her
performance alone.<br /><br />The plot is brilliant and will suck you in from the very beginning; I&#x27;m
not going to give anything away because that just would not be fun.<br /><br />So I plead to you my dear reader, stop whatever your doing and go
straight to the nearest theater and feast your eyes to one of Cinemas
most greatest achievements: The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.
