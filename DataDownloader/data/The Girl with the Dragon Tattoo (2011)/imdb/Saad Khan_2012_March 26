The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo &#x96; CATCH IT (A-) The Novel and Swedish
version&#x22; M&#xE4;n som hatar kvinnor/The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#x22; with
Noomi Rapace is a worldwide phenomena. There is no doubt that this is
one of the most complicated and complex novel hitting the shelves last
decades. Presenting the novel with all its complexities to the big
screen is challenging, the Swedish director Niels Arden Oplev did a
fantastic job with the first novel into a feature movie. Now it was
David Fincher&#x27;s turn to adopt the novel for American audiences with
Rooney Mara and transfer into something close to or surpass the
original phenomena with Noomi Rapace. Now I defiantly can say that
David Fincher has done a fantastic job with American &#x22;The Girl with the
Dragon Tattoo&#x22; but I cannot say that it&#x27;s better than the original.
Original is a classic masterpiece and Noomi Rapace deadly portray of
Lisbeth Slander will go down in the history. If you compare both movies
there is some difference like the characterization of Lisbeth Slander
and Mikael Blomkvist. In Swedish version Lisbeth is fierce and doesn&#x27;t
show her emotions to anyone. Though in American version Lisbeth is more
emotional and in the end her chasing down to Mikael Blomkvist shows her
romantic side which was missing both in books and Swedish version.
Maybe it was more David&#x27;s attempt for American audiences to except her.
I don&#x27;t think it was a bad think because it gives it a decent romantic
angel which is never a bad thing. Other major difference is Swedish
Mikael is looks older though American Mikael is the roughed hot man in
his best age. No wonder American Lisbeth falls for him. Noomi Rapace is
indeed the winner as Lisbeth but it doesn&#x27;t mean Rooney Mara is in
anyway less. She did a fantastic job as Lisbeth Salander, her Oscar nod
and stardom is totally worth it. Rooney Mara has shown how an average
looking girl can crush all the odds of success. Not for a second she
looked like a starlet, she defiantly lived the character really well.
Daniel Craig is really charismatic and pin perfect as Mikael Blomkvist.
Robin Wright is alright. Joel Kinnaman has non speaking part.
Christopher Plummer and Stellan Skarsgard are great in it. Overall,
David Fincher has directed an excellent movie in all aspects. The Girl
with Dragon Tattoo has detailed and intriguing story and enticing
performances to entertain us.
