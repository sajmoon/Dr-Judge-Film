Directing 9/10- Unique and almost trippy shots, that superbly mastered
an eerie sense to the film. Not Oscar worthy, but well done. Acting
10/10- Everyone in this film was fantastic, everyone. Mara, Skarsgard,
and Plummer(despite lack of screen time) gave academy award nomination
worthy performances, and Mara may deserve a win. Screenplay 8/10- I
don&#x27;t like giving films based on other materials perfect scores so an 8
is the best I can do here. Clearly it is unoriginal but with reading
the book I can say they did an excellent job transferring it to the big
screen. Visual Effects 7/10- Visually, the most remember-able sequence
was the opening credits. Well done visuals, nothing to write home
about, but solid job done. Music/Sound Effects 9/10- Sounds effects
were well done and the music is Oscar worthy.
