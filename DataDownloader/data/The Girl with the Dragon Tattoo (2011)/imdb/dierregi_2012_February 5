It is difficult to review a movie with such a dense narrative and
multi-layered references. As almost everybody knows, the story is based
on a best-selling trilogy of novels, written by a Swedish journalist.
Based on the novels, Swedish TV produced a mini-series of six episodes.<br /><br />I saw the whole thing and was underwhelmed. Enough to put me off from
reading the novels. Theoretically, the author aimed at glorifying his
strong heroine, Lisbeth Salander, who manages to thrive despite the
physical and mental violence she has to endure. In the Swedish series,
Lisbeth comes across as an unpleasant weirdo bent on revenge (even if
most rightfully so) and not so much as a role-model for battered women.<br /><br />This movie summarizes what in the Swedish series is two longish
episodes. Inevitably, much had to be cut off. Unfortunately, I doubt I
could have followed the movie without having previously watched the
series.<br /><br />The first part of this long story deals with introducing unorthodox
leading lady Lisbeth and her partner, disgraced journalist Mikael
Blomkvist. Their meeting is catalyzed by a weird investigation on a
missing girl. Unfortunately, this investigation is not much more than a
rehash of the &#x22;closed room&#x22; investigations from many thrillers of the
past. To make things more &#x22;modern&#x22; we have rape and serial killers
thrown in in what is a very trivial background.<br /><br />Forty years before the beginning of our story, a young girl named
Harriet Vanger, disappears from a small island. The island belongs to
the Vanger family, each and every member being on it the day of her
disappearance, to increase the number of suspects. Her uncle Henrik
seems to be the only one upset by her disappearance, but he still waits
quite a long time before reopening the case.<br /><br />Henrik Vanger assigns the investigation to Mikael, after having had his
background researched by the company that employs Lisbeth as an
&#x22;investigator&#x22; and hacker. In turn, Mikael asks for Lisbeth help to
solve the alleged murder mystery.<br /><br />The mystery revolves around the&#x22; usual&#x22; serial killer who goes around
leaving clues based on the Bible. I lost count on how many times I saw
an investigator solving a case by &#x22;finally&#x22; deciphering obscure
numerical clues by cross-checking the Bible. This is sloppy narrative.
Unfortunately, also the other main point of the movie &#x96; the battles of
fierce Lisbeth against abusing men &#x96; is equally disappointing.<br /><br />Compared to its Swedish counterpart, this American version is much more
opulent and visually brilliant. Interiors and exteriors are sleek,
polished and expensive-looking. Both main characters are played by
actors a lot better looking than the Swedish ones. However, they lack
credibility. The Lisbeth played by Rooney Mara is accurately styled as
a post-punk heroine, wearing trendy clothes and jewelery. The one
played by Swedish Rapace, was more a Joan Jet of the poor, looking
disheveled and not styled at all.<br /><br />I am sure many will appreciate this movie as a stand-alone thriller,
because of its sleek visuals and recognizable basic plot (the Bible
serial killer), missing completely the intricacies, plot twists and
convoluted heaviness of the whole series.
