Blown away. Totally. After a totally compelling opening visual effects
intro the film sorta became an average thriller. Mikael was slow. Then
came Salenger. Mikeal was more interesting. Salenger was - well - see
for yourself. We all wanted them to meet and they did. BOOOOOOOOM! The
Girl with the Dragon Tattoo exploded into one of the most
unique,compulsive can&#x27;t-take-your-eyes-off-the-screen movies I have
seen for a long time. I reckon I&#x27;m a decent judge of Cinema. African
Queen to the Shawshank Redemption. A good film is a good film.<br /><br />And this,also is a bloody good film. Watch for yourself. Pleasant it is
not. A great film it is. 10/10
