Watching Fincher&#x27;s remake was so much like deja vu that I wondered if
the director had simply employed CGI artists to superimpose American
and English faces over Swedish ones. I also wondered how Hollywood gets
away with this level of grotesque artistic plagiarism. Niels Arden
Oplov must surely be outraged because this is more his film than
Fincher&#x27;s. This is a remake with absolutely no creative effort put
in-except for those appallingly unnecessary and unconvincing
faux-Swedish accents. Why even bother? All I can think is Fincher was
under contract to make his film identical to Oplov&#x27;s, but using English
language. <br /><br />This remake is more of a sham than Van Sant&#x27;s ill-conceived Psycho,
which at least was made with a clear (albeit unconvincing) rationale in
mind. Everyone knows that Hollywood is nothing but a big whore, but
this time the whore has taken a huge dump on the customer. Maybe
Hollywood has decided that audiences are into coprophagia these days
... certainly after reading some of the user reviews that actually
praise this film (a lot of whom did not see the Swedish version), it
seems like they&#x27;re not wrong.
