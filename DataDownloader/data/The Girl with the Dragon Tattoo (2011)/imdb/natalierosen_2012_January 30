I know the film is based on a best seller. I loathed it and walked out
after an animal was brutally killed.<br /><br />Sure the performances were good if one wants to watch brutality at its
best. My friend read the book but knew that she would not want to see a
film that portrayed the worst kind of violence. Why is our world nuts?
Go to this flick and see! I will never understand why films of this
nature appeal to people. Filmmakers obviously make a film that they
know will sell. <br /><br />Ah for the films like &#x22;The Days of Wine and Roses&#x22; or &#x22;Rebel without a
Cause&#x22; or &#x22;The Apartment&#x22;...all of those films had substance. Today
every year it seems they try to outdo the year before with disgusting
extremist actions. sadomasochistic utter brutality in detail. I wanted
to throw a rock though the screen. Now how non violent is that?! <br /><br />I want my money back!
