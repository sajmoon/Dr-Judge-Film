The lights dim, the movie begins with a brief prologue, and the zany
and incredibly weird opening credits begin, set to a creepy cover of
Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &#x22;Immigrant Song.&#x22; From the beginning, we are in for a
wild ride as Stieg Larsson&#x27;s incredibly popular novel &#x22;The Girl with
the Dragon Tattoo&#x22; is brought to life on screen.<br /><br />Scorned journalist Mikael Blomkvist is called upon by Henrik Vanger, a
very wealthy man, while writing a book. Vanger is in search of an
answer to the disappearance of his niece, Harriet, which occurred over
40 years ago. He assumes that Harriet is dead, and that she was
murdered. He looks to Mikael to investigate her disappearance and who
killed her. Then Mikael gets assistance from Lisbeth Salander, a
dangerous but intelligent 24 year-old punk who is an accomplished
computer hacker and a great contribution to the solving of other
crimes. Together, Mikael and Lisbeth go on a dark, eerie journey into a
world of crime, Nazism, and corruption that will lead them to Harriet&#x27;s
assassin.<br /><br />I walked into &#x22;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#x22; with almost no
knowledge of Larsson&#x27;s novel or the Swedish film made a few years
before David Fincher&#x27;s version. The end result is ultimately an
extremely satisfying, brutal, and complex thriller thanks to great
direction by Fincher (known greatly for his work on &#x22;Seven,&#x22; &#x22;The
Game,&#x22; and &#x22;The Social Network&#x22;), excellent writing, and an impeccably
chosen cast.<br /><br />After only a few years, the character of Lisbeth Salander has become an
attention-grabbing heroine that is as iconic as Edward Cullen of the
love-it-or-hate-it &#x22;Twilight&#x22; series. And we can understand why. After
all the truly awful and hideous things that have plagued her life,
Lisbeth doesn&#x27;t take any crap from anybody. She may be angry, violent,
overtly sexual, demanding, and perhaps a little crazy, but she is a
genius at what she does, and has reasons for all of her actions, no
matter how gruesome they may be.<br /><br />The mystery surrounding the film is sophisticated and white-knuckling,
adding to the intensity and mood of the story and its characters. We&#x27;re
not sure of who is Harriet&#x27;s killer, or if Harriet is even dead, until
the last half hour of the film, and when we do find out the twist, it
leaves a stupendous impact.<br /><br />After cementing his reputation in brutal crime thrillers, and
surprising us with &#x22;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button&#x22; and &#x22;The
Social Network,&#x22; David Fincher was the right man for the director&#x27;s
chair. Every film he makes, even a drama like &#x22;The Social Network,&#x22;
sets up a tone of genuine suspense, tension, and fear for the
characters. &#x22;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#x22; isn&#x27;t any different as
Fincher adds his signature touch to the movie.<br /><br />Of all of the people they could have chosen to play these roles, the
casting director landed in a pot of gold. Daniel Craig does a wonderful
job as Mikael, showing us that he can play characters other than James
Bond. With the amount of screen time she has, Robin Wright is also very
good as Blomkvist&#x27;s business partner Erika Berger. Christopher Plummer
and Stellan Skarsg&#xE5;rd also turn in great performances as Henrik Vanger
and Martin Vanger.<br /><br />The person to really watch out for, however, is Rooney Mara as Lisbeth
Salander. Getting her big break in the underrated remake of &#x22;A
Nightmare on Elm Street&#x22; and later starring in Fincher&#x27;s previous film
&#x22;The Social Network&#x22; (giving a dynamite performance in the opening
scene), Mara has sealed her future with many more promising and
exciting roles because of her portrayal of Lisbeth. This is not an easy
role to play, knowing that Mara is the second person to play the
character. She must endure two shocking rape scenes and a torture
sequence, and there is a hefty amount of nudity involved. Mara embodies
Lisbeth, immediately bringing immense intimidation, danger, and fury
every time she comes on to the screen. Her eyes are wide and
emotionless, almost as if you can see right through her. And with
everything that has happened to the character, we understand that
Lisbeth has a right to be that way. She may be smart, but she is not
interested in attraction or friendships with another human being.
Overall, Mara gives a sensational, fearless, dedicated, and
electrifying performance that guarantees an Oscar nod.<br /><br />Being released during the cheery time of the holidays, &#x22;The Girl with
the Dragon Tattoo&#x22; is not a feel-good film, by any means. It is a
harsh, gritty, and rough cinema trip that answers the question of
leaving the kids at home with the babysitter. Also, if you&#x27;re
squeamish, you will not like it. However, those who have read the book,
and those who have not read it, should check it out. Even without
having read Larsson&#x27;s novel, I left the theater completely satisfied.
It is a movie experience that you don&#x27;t commonly get. Fincher has done
it again. &#x22;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#x22; is a must!
