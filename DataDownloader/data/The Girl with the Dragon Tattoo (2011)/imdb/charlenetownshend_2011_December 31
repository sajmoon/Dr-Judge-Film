As a huge fan of the books and original movie in 2009 I had high hopes
for the newest addition and was in no way disappointed. The movie was
in fact incredible, with all the suspense and vast intelligence of the
book and 2009 film this remake has easily made itself a contender for
the best film of the year. The script was incredible, location and
shooting was beautiful and the cast was absolutely incredible. As a
lover of Daniel Craig and Stellan Skarsgaard I expected great things
and was not disappointed, but both had to take a back seat for the
lifetime performance by Rooney Mara. Easily one of the best
performances I have seen in a very long time, you could see every part
of her being and soul went into playing the amazing Lisbeth Salander,
Noomi Rapace should be proud that her amazing performance in 2009 has
been carried on to the same excellence with this astounding remake.
