2012_March 19 
I&#x27;m probably one of the few people left who came to this film knowing
nothing about it whatsoever. I never saw the original films even though
I knew I should and, while I was aware that the story was some form of
mystery with roots in history, I had more of a &#x22;Dan Brown&#x22; type story
in my mind and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it. The opening credits of
the US version threw me even more as I wasn&#x27;t sure what these visceral
figures were about or if they were indicative of the film to come.
Fortunately after the impact of the credits the film does settle down
somewhat and more of a story begins to be told.<br /><br />I had been told that the film was hard to follow and I agreed with
Blomkvist when he comments to Vanger that he will struggle with all the
names, but the latter was correct when he says soon enough you&#x27;ll know
them. Accordingly the story does flow well throughout the film with the
mystery unfolding in a way that takes the viewer with it rather than
pulling it out of the blue towards the end, or demanding the audience
do too much work. It does help that it is fairly superficial as a story
when you boil it down to its basics, but it is presented with a lot
going on and a sense of danger and darkness that I enjoyed. It is
probably longer than it needs to be but it doesn&#x27;t ever really drag;
there is some time at the end of the film after the mystery has been
solved that could have been reigned in, but in fairness they extend the
character of Lisbeth so it wasn&#x27;t time wasted. Similarly although the
sexual material between Lisbeth and her new guardian is secondary to
the mystery, it is worth it because it informs us on her.<br /><br />Having made Social Network, Fincher seemed to be a good choice for a
plot that involves a lot of computer searching and pouring over old
records &#x96; and indeed he was, to the point that he is the real selling
point here. He directs with a real good touch along with Social Network
cinematographer Cronenweth. There is little action but the shot framing
and the feel of the film gives it a tension and an edge that suits the
superficial feel it does have. This isn&#x27;t a great aspect of the film
but it isn&#x27;t a major problem either since I felt that the delivery of
the story does rather cover these weaknesses. I was fortunate to come
to the cast without the need to compare with the original (having never
seen it) and perhaps I liked them more for this. Mara is good but I
never shook off the feeling of her lacking an edge and too often I
didn&#x27;t feel like this character was fully fleshed out in her hands &#x96;
still good, but that feeling stuck with me. Craig is strong in the lead
as he plays quite a bookish type. The support is deep in faces all
doing good work &#x96; Plummer, Skarsg&#xE5;rd, Berkoff, Richardson, Wright and
others.<br /><br />Overall Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a solidly engaging mystery that
is a little bit too long but mostly unfolds well thanks to strong
delivery in the superficial aspects. The cast, the cinematography and
the direction create a sense of darkness and danger that is effective
at taking the viewer along. I&#x27;m not seeing the brilliant film or story
that millions other around the world proclaim it as, but I did enjoy it
for what it did well.
