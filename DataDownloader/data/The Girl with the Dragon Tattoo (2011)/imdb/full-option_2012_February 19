This movie is one of the ugliest movies I&#x27;ve seen in my whole life. I
ask myself how anyone can see this movie through till the end, if you
want to remain human and sane. The rape scene shocked me more than the
one in the movie &#x27;Irreversible&#x27; simply because I didn&#x27;t expected it and
it was far more sadistic. And the rape scene in the movie Irreversible
was a much contested one ! In my opinion, this movie is for the voyeurs
only. I left after the rape scene because I wanted to keep my sanity
and self-respect. Afterwards I was informed by other viewers about the
even more sadistic revenge by this minor leading actress who&#x27;s praised
for it by the public. Injustly. She should have refused this role. You
would like her do that too if she were your daughter . This movie is so
ugly. That sort of movies and the praise they get from the public cause
me to doubt humanity. Avoid if you are a thinking and feeling human
being and want to stay that.
