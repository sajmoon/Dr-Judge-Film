I did not read the book. I don&#x27;t necessarily want to read the book, but
the movie is very slick to look at which, I like very much. I prefer
not to have to go back and research any book that a movie is based-on
in order to follow the details I think are missing in the movie. That
said, the original Swedish version of this story is much easier to
follow than in this American version. The intensity is lacking in the
American version and I was not as captivated by Rooney Mara as Noomi
Rapace, who is far more compelling on screen than Rooney Mara in this
role. Craig was miscast here, and I like him as an actor dashing across
a roof like a scalded cat, but not here portraying an editor. Plummer
is perfect, as usual. Without resorting to comparing the book to the
movie, which is inappropriate I think, this American movie version is
simply bland by comparison. I was spellbound and hypnotized by the
Swedish version, but unfortunately, just mildly drawn to the plot and
characters which in my opinion were far too restrained in the drama
they brought to the performance, no doubt designed for overly sensitive
American viewers. It would help also if the dialog were easier to hear.
What&#x27;s up with all the whispering? I&#x27;ll just have to rent the video and
play it with subtitles on to discover what is being said. Don&#x27;t get me
wrong - the movie is very watchable as a kind of long music video. I
intend to watch this movie several times to see if my negative
impressions last over the long run. As movies go, without comparing
them to the books they are based on which is unfair, I say see this
movie and then see the Swedish versions and decide for yourself.
