WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW : THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO<br /><br />MINI-REVIEW : Sex, violence, and a great mystery<br /><br />RATING : Wait for the instant download (Rating System: &#x22;See it in
theaters,&#x22; &#x22;Wait for the instant download,&#x22; &#x22;Don&#x27;t waste your time&#x22;)<br /><br />Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig, &#x22;Cowboys and Aliens&#x22;) is a journalist
for the independent London magazine &#x22;Millennium.&#x22; He has just lost a
libel case where he exposed a Madoff-like villain, but could not prove
his facts without revealing his sources. He is about to lose his life
savings and his magazine.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Swedish multimillionaire Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plumber,
&#x22;Priest&#x22;) has hired a leather-clad, pierced, tattooed young woman
(Lisbeth Salander played by Rooney Mara, &#x22;The Social Network&#x22;) to
investigate Blomkvist using her internet uber-hacking-powers. Vanger
has a mystery he needs solving: His niece has gone missing and presumed
dead for forty years. However, he receives an anonymous gift from her
that only she would send. He wants Blomkvist to find out who is sending
the gifts.<br /><br />But Blomkvist cannot do it alone; he needs the help of the very person
who did his background investigation - Lisbeth. Now, it is up to him
and his unlikely companion to uncover the coldest of cold cases. And
we&#x27;re off&#x85;<br /><br />I&#x27;ve never read the 800-page tome (by Stieg Larson) that inspired this
movie, but I did see the original Scandinavian version. The Hollywood
version is every bit as good as the original, and then some. The first
difference is the amazingly complicated and detailed CGI opening
credits. I felt as though I was watching a Bond movie intro. The other
big difference is the longish aftermath. The ending goes into a good
bit of detail about what happens to our characters after the thrilling
climax. I have to say I enjoyed both additions. <br /><br />I do have one complaint: The original film made Lisbeth appear to be
the aggressor in her relationship with Blomkvist. She even appears to
have manipulated him. This new version has changed that relationship. I
preferred the original ending. Sadly, I cannot say which is more true
to Larson&#x27;s novel.<br /><br />The plot had the potential to be incredibly complex. It involved at
least a dozen members of Vanger&#x27;s family. On top of that we had to
constantly switch between 1960&#x27;s Vanger-family and current-day Vanger-
family. However, the director (David Fincher, &#x22;The Social Network&#x22;) had
Blomkvist post a family tree on his cabin wall with pictures of old-
family and current-family. It was a very nice device which allowed the
audience to keep all the players straight.<br /><br />I have heard that some people thought the depiction of sexual violence
was gratuitous. The rape scenes were not easy to watch. However, they
were certainly no worse than the original Scandinavian version. I think
there is no good way to portray rape. Panning to curtains blowing in an
open window doesn&#x27;t do justice to the violation of the victim. Whereas
showing the details of the act may, by some, be seen as titillating. I
felt that the director had the balance right. It was clear our victim
was being hurt in a most personal way, without exploiting the act for
entertainment. This was most clearly demonstrated as we saw the victim
in the shower later that night with cuts and bruises over a third of
her body. If any movie-goer experienced voyeuristic pleasure in the
rape scene, then it should have been snuffed-out by the shower scene.<br /><br />The movie clocked-in at about 2 hours and 40 minutes. And while it was
longer than most movies, it didn&#x27;t disappoint. The mystery, action, and
unfolding lives of the protagonists made the time slip by. However,
there is no good reason to rush out and see this movie in the theaters.
In fact, it is a good one to curl up on the sofa with someone you find
dear. So, for a good retelling of a now-classic tale, but a bit on the
longish side, I recommend you wait for the instant download.
