Despite any reservations a viewer might have about a prompt English
version re-make of a very successful Swedish film still popular in this
country - the first novel in author Stieg Larsson&#x27;s Millennium Trilogy,
namely GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO - this version of Larsson&#x27;s story is
immensely successful. Much of that is due to the tightly woven
screenplay by Steven Zaillian and the extraordinary direction by one of
our most gifted directors, David Fincher (Fight Club, The Social
Network, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Seven, etc). But also the
gifts of the musical composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (with a
bit of help from a very well placed Morten Lauridson&#x27;s &#x27;Lux Aeterna&#x27;)
and the bitingly vivid cinematography of Jeff Cronenweth. Add to that
one of the finest collection of actors ever to collaborate on a project
and the result is a film that is so engrossing that its very long
length doesn&#x27;t seem long enough!<br /><br />Everyone knows the story by now: disgraced journalist, Mikael Blomkvist
(Daniel Craig), escapes to an island in Sweden at the request of Henrik
Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to investigate the 40 year absence of his
niece Harriet. The Vanger family is as dysfunctional and bitterly cruel
an ensemble as could be imagined and everyone on the island wants
Mikael to leave. The case fascinates Mikael and he gains access to the
services of an associate, the very bizarre and brilliant pierced,
tattooed, punk computer hacker named Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara). As
they work together in the investigation, Blomkvist and Salander uncover
immense corruption beyond anything they have ever imagined. There are
indelible characters along the way: the disgustingly sadistic Nils
Bjurman (a brilliant role for Yorick van Wageningen) who mistakenly
sexually abuses Lisbeth who in turn has her own manner of revenge), the
wily Martin Vanger (Stellan Skarsg&#xE5;rd), a brief but impressive Dragan
Armansky (Goran Visnjic), Anita Vanger (Joely Richardson), Inspector
Morelli (Donald Sumpter) etc etc etc. Every role is cast so carefully
that there is never a missed beat in this huge ensemble.<br /><br />For those who love the Swedish version of GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO
this English version will surely satisfy. They are different but for
this viewer the English version is far more memorable. There is
considerable frank sexual activity, torture, animal abuse, and there
are some gruesome scenes: they add and must be there. Kudos to all
concerned. And yes, Rooney Mara really is that fine! <br /><br />Grady Harp
