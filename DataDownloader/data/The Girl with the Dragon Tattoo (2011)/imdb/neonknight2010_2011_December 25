The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo didn&#x27;t disappoint me.<br /><br />I felt it on par with original Swedish version.<br /><br />Rooney Mara was fantastic but not better than Noomi Rapace.<br /><br />Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross should never stop making the scores for
Fincher, it was superb.<br /><br />However, is it necessary to remake a great movie and do it on the same
level? Why not blow it outta the water?<br /><br />At least it wasn&#x27;t a failed attempt. I may seem harsh, but I actually
liked it quite a lot.<br /><br />4/5
