I for one am not a big reader of novels, and I have never read &#x22;The
Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#x22;, yet I must say that David Fincher&#x27;s in
depth and long drawn out film adaptation had me in interest with
suspense and complex thought. As one knows any Fincher film often shows
the brutal and raw nature of life and with many scenes in this picture
he pulled back no punches. As one watches this complex drama a mystery
of dirty secrets will unfold and the film is guided by it&#x27;s grit and
raw erotic sex scenes which keep the viewer even more intrigued.<br /><br />The story involves soviet journalist Mikael Blomkvist(Daniel
Craig)who&#x27;s a man that&#x27;s clearly a little burned out with his work only
it once again gets interesting when he&#x27;s hired by a rich international
family man Henrik Vanger(the superb Christopher Plummer)to investigate
the disappearance of one of his dear loved ones a young girl in the
family. Only soon thru it all Mikael&#x27;s investigation will lead to more
and more gruesome discovered disappearances and brutal murders. On the
side in an interesting subplot is the arrival of an exotic and strange
computer hacker named Lisbeth Salander(in a raw and gritty performance
from Rooney Mara)and she is Mikael&#x27;s assistance to breaking the secrets
and lies of the dark past underworld of many cases. Along the way the
passion of hot erotic and kinky sex encounters occur between the two
which spices the film up some. And as always with a Fincher film he
shows how brutal life can be it&#x27;s often raw and wicked as evidenced by
the blunt and provocative rape scene.<br /><br />Overall good film that will hold your interest even though it&#x27;s drawn
out and complex it&#x27;s one interesting mystery of secrets, and an
interesting journey. The film shows that life is raw and often
mysterious with secrets and lies.
