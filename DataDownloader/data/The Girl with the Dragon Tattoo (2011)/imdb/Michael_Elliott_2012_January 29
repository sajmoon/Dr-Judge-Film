Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The (2011) <br /><br />*** 1/2 (out of 4)<br /><br />David Fincher&#x27;s telling of the Stieg Larsson novel about a reporter
(Daniel Craig) who is asked by an elderly man (Christopher Plummer) to
find out who murdered his niece forty years earlier. The report comes
upon on dead end after another so he seeks the help of a troubled but
brilliant computer hacker (Rooney Mara). I haven&#x27;t read the novel so I
can&#x27;t comment one way or another on how close this film is to it but as
someone who wasn&#x27;t familiar with the story I must say that Fincher has
created a rather unique film. I say unique because while watching the
movie I couldn&#x27;t help but admire how laid back it actually is. There&#x27;s
really not any flashy style, in-your-face fake thrill moments and
there&#x27;s an overall atmosphere of something very calm and cold. Those
familiar with the work of Ingmar Bergman will probably see a connection
to his films because of this coldness that is one full display here.
The film takes place in the winter and you can just feel the coldness
really coming off the screen and it&#x27;s this white, almost dreamlike
nature that really makes the film work so well. The images in front of
us are usually quite pretty but they&#x27;re all surrounding by a rather
brutal and ugly story that tackles many taboo subjects. Fincher handles
the material quite well and with a running time of 158-minutes I was
shocked to see how well he kept the thing moving as there&#x27;s really not
a slow or dry moment to be found. The pacing is incredibly good and
this is especially impressive considering how much he packs into the
running time and how there&#x27;s very little action. Of course, another
major benefit are the performances with Craig really turning in one of
the best of his career. I&#x27;ve read a few negative reviews saying that
he&#x27;s too &#x22;James Bond&#x22; here as a reporter but I didn&#x27;t find that to be
the case at all. Plummer is always reliable and we get nice supporting
performances by Robin Wright and Stellan Skarsgard. Then there&#x27;s the
Oscar-nominated Mara who easily steals the show. She&#x27;s completely
believable in the part and it doesn&#x27;t matter if she&#x27;s being abused or
giving the abuse as you can see her in both sides. THE GIRL WITH THE
DRAGON TATTOO features a terrific score, some wonderful cinematography
and all of this adds up to a very good thriller. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a
classic but it&#x27;s certainly in a league to itself.
