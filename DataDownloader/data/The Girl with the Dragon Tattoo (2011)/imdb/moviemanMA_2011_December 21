The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is certainly one of the more depressing
films of the year, but also one of the most enthralling, hard to turn
away from films of the year. It follows Mikael Blomkvist (Craig), a
journalist who has just lost everything, and Lisbeth Salander (Rooney
Mara), a researcher/computer hacker whose life has been nothing but
hardship and misunderstanding since her adolescent years. The two
converge on a case surrounding one of the more prominent and dirty
families in all of Sweden, the Vangers.<br /><br />Henrik Vanger (Plummer) hires Mikael to investigate the disappearance
of his niece. He encounters many problems, the biggest being the
disappearance happened 40 years ago. When his research starts getting
interesting and more dangerous, he calls upon Lisbeth, who did the
background check on Mikael for the Vangers. Together the two try to
solve the case, digging up hidden truths, dirty secrets, and
encountering some detestable characters along the way. They don&#x27;t know
if they&#x27;re getting close or farther from the truth, but as the heat
turns up, it seems like the answer is rapidly approaching, or is it
their impending demise?<br /><br />What stands out most about this film from the original Swedish version
of a few years ago is the mood. Yes, both films cover some disturbing
material, but the original version looks like it was filmed in the real
world. Fincher, however, creates an entirely different world. It looks,
feels, and almost smells dirty. There is hardly a white light found in
the film. Even the snow is turned grey by the overcast skies. You get
the feeling that there is no hope for these characters.<br /><br />There is really only one area where the film lacks. Pacing. There is so
much information to translate to the audience. It&#x27;s the job of the
editor and the writer to make sure that the audience doesn&#x27;t skip a
beat. There is montage after montage, intercuts, and Swedish writing
thrown about that it&#x27;s hard to keep track of what exactly a character
is doing. We get the gist of it all, but there were moments when I was
lagging behind just enough to notice.<br /><br />Other than that I thought the film was a fine adaptation for American
audiences. I wasn&#x27;t sure how the sexual violence would be handled, but
Fincher doesn&#x27;t hold back, much like the Swedish film. Is it important
that we see this violence? I hate to say it but yes. We need to like
Lisbeth so much that we completely disregard her outward appearance and
see her as a survivor. She&#x27;s extremely talented and fearless. Mara
brings Lisbeth to life much like Noomi Rapace brought her to life, only
Mara is a letter more brazen and less moody than Noomi, but both are
effective with what they do. Craig too gives a solid performance. I was
worried that they would try to toughen his character up (seeing as
Craig is currently James Bond), but they didn&#x27;t. They make him likable
only because he seems normal and one who stands up for what he believes
in.<br /><br />It&#x27;s a slimy, complex, fast-moving thriller that is sure to turn some
heads at times but in the end you&#x27;ll be holding your breath and hoping
for the best. You might go into the movie clean, but you&#x27;ll come out
dirty.
