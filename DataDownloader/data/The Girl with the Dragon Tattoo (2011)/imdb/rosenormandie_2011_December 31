Went to see this yesterday; theater was full (almost). What was the
value of the rape scene? Nothing like putting things in peoples&#x27; minds.
And the sex scenes were unnecessary also, lets leave a little to the
imagination, did the full act have to be filmed? I didn&#x27;t understand
the story until halfway thru the movies. The actors didn&#x27;t speak very
clearly, or I&#x27;m losing my hearing!!! That&#x27;s why I love old movies, you
can understand what they say! So overall, I guess I was
disappointed...the storyline could have been good. I also didn&#x27;t care
for the darkness of the weather, it made it seem dank and dark. I
realize weather is unpredictable, but couldn&#x27;t they have had at least
one sunny day?
