When you make a remake of a movie version of a well-loved book series,
you&#x27;re going to upset some people. Normally I wouldn&#x27;t be interested in
seeing something so far removed from the original, but the reviews were
so good that I decided to give it a shot, and I was not disappointed.
This is a very solid movie. <br /><br />It is difficult to take a book with the complicated relationships of
Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and turn it into a comprehensible movie
script, but I think this film succeeds. Is it 100% faithful? No, many
details have been left out. Does it need to be? If you feel a movie&#x27;s
first objective is to be a 100% accurate reproduction of the source
material then this movie is a failure.<br /><br />If, however, you feel that a movie should stand and fall on its own
merits and should be its own experience then I think this movie
succeeds. Daniel Craig&#x27;s persona lacks a bit of warmth which I think
his role needs to engender Lizbeth&#x27;s trust, but that is my biggest
complaint.<br /><br />Having seen the movie, you will not have read the book. But you will
have seen an intelligent, well-crafted re-imagining of the original.
