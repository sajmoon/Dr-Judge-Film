Very well made film. Director David Fincher at his finest with another
film worth seeing. I truly love the actors and I don&#x27;t think that there
could have been better choices. performances and the two main
characters were great! Rooney Mara delivered an riveting performance
and hope to see a sequel. Daniel Craig, once again has showed his true
talent for acting. Money well spent and the story line couldn&#x27;t have
been better. This movie has a certain taste if you truly want to enjoy
it and I did for sure. I recommend this film to all people who love to
try and decipher a secret story line. Money well spent and hope you
like it!
