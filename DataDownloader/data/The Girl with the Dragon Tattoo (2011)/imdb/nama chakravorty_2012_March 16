From the novel of the same name by Stieg Larsson, Maverick Filmmaker
David Fincher&#x27;s &#x27;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#x27; is A Masterstroke! A
nail-biting, brutal, edge-of-the-seat thriller, that ranks amongst the
best films from 2011! <br /><br />&#x27;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#x27; Synopsis: Journalist Mikael Blomkvist
is aided in his search for a woman who has been missing for forty years
by Lisbeth Salander, a young computer hacker.<br /><br />&#x27;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#x27; is a must see because Writer Steven
Zaillian fabulously adapts the Novel, that in all aspects, is gripping,
brutal, nail-biting &#x26; edge-of-the-seat. The Suspense gets intense &#x26;
fierce with each passing sequence, while the characters only get
darker. Zaillian&#x27;s Adapted Screenplay is truly remarkable!<br /><br />Fincher&#x27;s Direction is Razor-Sharp &#x26; Haunting. The Maverick Filmmaker
has handled this Thriller masterfully! Cinematography by Jeff
Cronenweth is flawless. Editing by Kirk Baxter &#x26; Angus Wall, which won
an Oscar, is indeed crisp. Art Design is good.<br /><br />Performance-Wise: Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander, delivers a knock-out
performance. Her Oscar-Nomnination doesn&#x27;t come up as a surprise at
all. This is a star-making performance! Daniel Craig as Mikael
Blomkvist, is first-rate. The Great Christopher Plummer is terrific,
while Stellan Skarsg&#xE5;rd has never been good. Robin Wright is
impressive. Joely Richardson is top-notch. Yorick van Wageningen is
loathsome! <br /><br />On the whole, &#x27;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#x27; is a must see film.
