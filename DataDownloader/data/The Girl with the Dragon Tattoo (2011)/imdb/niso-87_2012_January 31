Im not such a fan of action. But i can really say i really enjoyed
watching this movie there were something captivating in this movie the
actors were brilliant the story was mysterious in such a beautiful way.
but i really didn&#x27;t understand the ending when Elizabeth empties
accounts that was foe what purpose??? and why she bought him a gift to
see him with other girl... and why she would be upset she said they
were friends. but this was a brilliant movie everyone should see.
Action, mystery , emotional and simply wonderful. Finally I could
really say that the movie stole my mind, loved the mystery and how the
clues fall down. But what really killed me is seeing the cat killed in
this way it broke my heart more than anything else. One more thing , i
think the sexual content on the beginning of the movie were unnecessary
. but Just wonderful.
