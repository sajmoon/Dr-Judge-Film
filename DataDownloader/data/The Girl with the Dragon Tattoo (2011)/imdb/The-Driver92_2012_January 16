After viewing the fairly well-produced and well-adapted &#x22;Girl&#x22; trilogy
of films (based on the Millennium novels by the late Stieg Larrson) by
director Niels Arden Oplev, the question, &#x22;Why see yet another version
of this same story?&#x22; (even if it is done in English, Hollywood style)
may just cross one&#x27;s mind especially in a diminished economy where
frugality renders duplication superfluous. However close to the
perfection of the author&#x27;s vision Noomi Rapace&#x27;s performance might have
been, Rooney Mara&#x27;s incarnation of Lisbeth Salander seems more nuanced;
she smolders with anger and vengeance like her predecessor, but
withdraws in pretty silhouettes with a psychological vulnerability that
endows her with even more antisocial magnetism and hints at the
underbelly personal history yet to be revealed.<br /><br />Even though easy-on-the-eyes Daniel Craig, as the intrepid journalist
Mikhal Blomkvist, more than adequately portrays the likable character
with a winning, almost unconscious self-consciousness, he
conciliatorily fades into the background when Mara is on the screen. As
in the novel, Salander&#x27;s edgy efficiency and genius works well against
a backdrop of a seemingly well-oiled society equipped with high-speed
trains and technology yet rotting from within with a moral corruptness
that suggests repressed aggression. Mara&#x27;s face mirrors both Lisbeth&#x27;s
fierce rebellion and the forever scars she wears like a tattoo of
resistant resilience.<br /><br />Director David Fincher deviates a bit from the gospel of the Larsson
text--his Lisbeth admits her past openly to Blomkvist in a TMI scene
that isn&#x27;t true to the sensibility of the written character. Perhaps,
Fincher, worried about the reception of this English version and
concerned about executing its sequels, reveals too much to accentuate
Lisbeth&#x27;s misplaced sense of betrayal regarding Blomkvist&#x27;s limited yet
open promiscuity. Perhaps, his perception of her desire to please
Blomkvist with her opennessand her bodyeven after brutal sexual
subjugation underlines her role as woman and her place despite her
genius and injured sensibility. This is, after all, a novel, that in
Europe tellingly goes by the Swedish title &#x22;M&#xE4;n som hatar kvinnor&#x22;
which translates into English as &#x22;Men who hate women.&#x22; The novel&#x27;s
section headings are marked with statistics regarding the percentages
of women brutalized by men which, along with key instances in the plot
line describing women reduced to victim status due to the sadistic and
masochistic actions of their supposed caretakers or loved ones, suggest
that even with the seemingly blas&#xE9; attitude regarding casual sexual
relationships and equality amongst the sexes, there is indeed some
disturbing issue that in this culture cannot be rectified by the
actions of government or authority but by taking the matter into one&#x27;s
own very capable vigilante hands.<br /><br />In addition, rather than have the duo work together as in the novel to
eventually reveal the initiator of a forty-year-old crime, Fincher
chooses to film parallel sequences of enlightenment set to the
fast-paced sound of European motorcycles and the edgy organic music of
the Oscar-winning team of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. Thisworksto
cut the overall time of what could have easily been a three-hour police
procedural instead of a fascinating character study of an societal
outcast and her soon-to-be crusading knight errant.<br /><br />Fincher misses a key flashback scene opportunity where Lisbeth stands
and watches the killer die as his car bursts into flames. Why not have
his protagonist shudder with that remembrance from her own past and
givetheaudiencethethrill of mutualunderstanding? For those non-novel
readers, why not an anticipatory frisson of what is to come in the next
two installments? Maybe Fincher thought this would be a TMI moment.<br /><br />Bottom line? Director David Fincher (The Social Network) compacts
StiegLarsson&#x27;s rambling novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
(Millennium Trilogy) into two hours and 38 minutes of intense film
introducing to a mainstream English speaking audience the edgy
pathology and survival of Dragon Girl--social misfit, rebel and genius,
Lisbeth Salander. Be warned the film contains violent rape, the
depiction of a mutilated animal and stills of misogynistic torture. The
strength of Rooney Mara&#x27;s portrayal of the lead character is more than
enough reason to revisit this newer version. Recommended.
