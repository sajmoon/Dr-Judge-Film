David Fincher is one of my favorite directors so I was very excited to
see this automatically, and when I did I was taking away by how well
this was made all the way from the acting, music, scenery, visual
effects, story was simply amazing. What Rooney Mara&#x27;s character had to
go thru in the movie was hard to see sometimes but if you like that
kind of intensity you will not be disappointed, Daniel Craig nailed it
in his performance. Reminds me of Seven and how it kept you at the edge
of your seat with memorable scenes and pure strength on the deliver of
everything. The dark tone of the film is too much for some , but you
must understand the mystery of this film simply asks for it, the wonder
of whats going to happen next, who did what, to whom and when, the only
gripe I have is the ending because I wanted more of what is surely to
come. Worth the price of admission and I hope there will be some Oscars
given away for this amazing film. Loved it!
