This movie was so slow and boring, only to be peppered with nothing but
ridiculous scenes for shock value. <br /><br />I didn&#x27;t find it suspenseful (as you could figure out the guilty person
on your own pretty easily), I just found it desperate to shock.<br /><br />I&#x27;m so disappointed because I couldn&#x27;t wait to see it.<br /><br />I&#x27;m not sure what the awesome actors were thinking when they agreed to
do this movie. There really is an all-star cast.<br /><br />I heard someone snoring, others walked out, and a few teenage boys said
they wished they&#x27;d walked out. <br /><br />Yes, folks, it was that bad.
