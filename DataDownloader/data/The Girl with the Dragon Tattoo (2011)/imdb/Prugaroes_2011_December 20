Just saw a sneak peek of the film and couldn&#x27;t recommend it more.<br /><br />When I walked into it I never expected what I got, this is the best
adaptation of a novel I&#x27;ve ever seen.<br /><br />Most of the characters themselves capture the essence of Larssons novel
perfectly, but Rooney Mara&#x27;s portrayal of Lisbeth Salander is
Oscar-worthy. The woman perfectly captures the dichotomy of the
tortured, vulnerable soul with the calculating, sociopathic tendencies
embodied by the character.<br /><br />I wouldn&#x27;t want to reveal anything else, but for fans of the novel and
for fans of good film in general, this is a must see.
