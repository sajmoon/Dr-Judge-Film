This was the first film I watched after seeing The Hunger Games, and it
may sound weird, but in comparison this felt like a &#x22;real film&#x22;. I
haven&#x27;t read the book or seen the Swedish version, but this film
definitely made me interested in seeing it (and its sequels) which is
all you can really ask for in an adaptation. In stark contrast Hunger
games didn&#x27;t give me any interest in reading the book, strengthening
the quality of this film.<br /><br />Fincher made some brilliant choices in this film that could have easily
gone unnoticed, for example when Lisbeth is about to be raped the
camera pulls away from the room and fades to black. In a lesser film
this would be the end of the scene, but Fincher throws us right back
into it by cutting back into the room and forcing us to witness the
rape. It&#x27;s a great way to manipulate the audience expectations, and it
reminded me of something Akira Kurosawa said: &#x22;The role of the artist
is to not look away&#x22;. In this scene alone Fincher proves his artistry.<br /><br />I&#x27;ll admit that the story is a bit slow paced in the beginning but it
does a nice job of luring you into the two story-lines. Hopefully they
will make the other two films.
