I was excited to see Finches version of this fine movie. I was
extremely disappointed after watching it. The acting was good...but I
must say the script treatment was not as sophisticated as the original.
It seemed not as smooth as the original and a bit forced in some places
to get the story to flow faster. It suffers from the same sickness as
most Hollywood remakes of already good movies...the sacrifice details
in favor of shock, but such is the stuff of McMovieland. Everything
about the movie was acceptable and on par with the original EXCEPT for
the script treatment. You remember Let the Right One In? Hollywood
remade that one too and to me it sucked compared to the original. Both
remakes lack the ability to emotionally connect me to the characters
and their goals. A bit clinically and technically treated, as though
someone was in a big hurry to capitalize on the Tattoo series&#x27; success.
Shame on Hollywood.
