When I first read this book I found it slow going and long. Even after
reading half of it I didn&#x27;t like the confusion or the slow pace. At 3/4
I began to like it and by the time I finished it had grown on me.
Although not a well written book it was filled with detail that a movie
maker could use to craft what they wanted into the picture. <br /><br />When I saw the Swedish film I was really impressed. It was a little
confusing but much better than the book. The photography was
interesting and bright and helped to let the viewer focus on the
complex plot. The acting was really good and it was surprising that
none of the characters were particularly attractive. I expected the
English version to be much less realistic and it was but that&#x27;s OK. We
imagine ourselves as the characters and are used to Hollywood. The
shocking scenes of nudity, homosexuality, rape, sadism, bondage and
torture are brutal and I&#x27;m not sure if this isn&#x27;t the most shocking to
the sensibilities of any movie I&#x27;ve seen in my life. It stays with you
long after you watch it and doesn&#x27;t make me want to go visit Sweden
anytime soon. I&#x27;ll never think of it as the land of Elke Summer again.
On the plus side I was really amazed at the quality of acting,
photography, editing and overall movie-making in the Swedish film. It&#x27;s
not just at the top of foreign films it is comparable to any non
special effect American movie. <br /><br />The American version I expected to be even better. I thought it would
show the superior expertise of writers here portraying the complex plot
in a more understandable manner. I thought there would be more effort
shown with the pace of the movie and all the areas that we excel in
because of the huge sums of money we put into our films. After all they
were copying not only a best selling book but the most successful movie
ever made in Sweden. How could it help but be better. Unfortunately I
was wrong on all counts. <br /><br />This should have been a piece of cake. They weren&#x27;t working from a book
but already had a very good movie to work from. It seems like the worst
they could do was just dub it in English and reap millions. Instead
they started with a Terminator beginning like a James Bond movie,
completely out of place and inexplicable. Then they get a director of
dark, scary movies to create a dark mood with DARK visuals to make
everything hard to see and understand. Sure don&#x27;t need that with a
complex plot. The music seemed out of place also. You don&#x27;t need all
this scary stuff when the story is absolutely frightening without it
and when the contrast of bright clarity and horrible actions is much
more shocking. <br /><br />A word about the characters. Daniel Craig looks a lot like the Swedish
actor Michael Nyqvist except without the bad skin. Both were very good
actors. The Girl Lizbeth (Noomi Rapace) was excellent. Going in
everyone knew this was an Academy Award part besides being a three film
role. What actress wouldn&#x27;t want this role? And Mara Rooney also did a
great job EXCEPT - now maybe I&#x27;m just getting old but they had her
whisper stuff and mumble things and I absolutely couldn&#x27;t hear or
understand them. In a movie that has such incredible suspense you don&#x27;t
want to be asking the person next to you in the theater what the hell
she said.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I like this movie. It was frightening. It was
shocking. It was consequently REALLY memorable. But what an opportunity
lost. I can&#x27;t imagine how it could be easier to make a movie when all
you have to do is copy a great one, make it in English, and improve on
the weak points. Unfortunately it&#x27;s sort of like they remade Pride and
Prejudice with John Woo directing, and used rap music. The movie is a
&#x22;B&#x22; that will get treated as an &#x22;A&#x22; because of the subject matter of
abuse of women and how graphic the scenes of sexual abuse are. Rooney
will receive awards, etc. But oh, what it could have been. <br /><br />If you like this movie, which you will, get the Swedish version. You&#x27;ll
like it better.
