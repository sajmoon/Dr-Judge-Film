The US remake of &#x22;Dragon Tattoo&#x22; is inferior to the original in every
aspect of film-making: script, acting, directing, cinematography,
music, editing--even credits. Fincher puts the story together with the
energy and creativity of someone painting by the numbers. Daniel Craig,
with his absurdly tight clothing, registers no emotional, intellectual
or sensual qualities of the male hero. Rooney Mara has the stare of
Salandar, but nothing else.<br /><br />My wife and I looked at the original right after seeing the Fincher
version on screen. Danish director Niels Oplev captured the characters
beautifully, and his cast gave their characters distinct and rounded
qualities. Fincher&#x27;s version was also soft on Nazism compared with the
original, weakening the political insights and critiques that are the
skeleton of Larsson&#x27;s works. Rapace makes Lisbeth as fascinating as she
is in the novels; Mara succeeds in making her only weird and sullen.<br /><br />The cobbled-together editing and crutch-like flashbacks make one wonder
why Fincher decided to disrupt the original&#x27;s great flow, energy and
clarity with such ineffectual modifications, modifications that sap the
story of its power. The annoying, modern- mechanistic soundtrack of the
U.S. version, like the oily black credits, betray a desire to say
&#x22;listen to me!&#x22; and &#x22;look at me&#x22; rather than to work organically with
the story. I don&#x27;t see how any serious movie lover could rate this
pitiable remake as worth seeing over the original.
