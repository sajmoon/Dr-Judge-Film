First off, the casting was perfect. I wasn&#x27;t sure if Daniel Craig could
make a believable and realistic transition from James bond to an
average journalist. And the most impressive factor to this film was
Rooney Mara who hasn&#x27;t had a good deal of limelight other than playing
Erika Albright in the social network (also by David fincher). The movie
was gritty, realistic, and very entertaining. With a plot that a
mystery buff couldn&#x27;t resist, it captivates your attention and keeps
your eyes on the screen throughout all the two and a half hours you&#x27;re
watching. All characters show their personal pros and cons in simple
ways that only add to the depth of the story and all things related. To
say it all in all, the movie was tremendous and should win at least two
of the Oscars it&#x27;s been nominated for. It&#x27;s worth going out of your way
to see, because you won&#x27;t be disappointed.
