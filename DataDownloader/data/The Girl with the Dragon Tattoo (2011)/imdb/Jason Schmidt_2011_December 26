David Fincher. 30-second spots strung together for 2 1/2 hours. As much
as I love a beautiful scene, a quick, clever edit and Trent Reznor&#x27;s
edgy sounds all separate from each other, these elements together are
not the way to tell this story &#x96; a complex one at that. Because today&#x27;s
youth, and by extension their parents, are so enamored with anything
that is &#x22;quick,&#x22; it has to be revered as a work of genius?<br /><br />Fast-cut MTV-style editing, like fast talking, does not make something
good. Just because you, audience, could not follow entire sections of
the plot doesn&#x27;t make you dumb. It makes the director dumb.<br /><br />I give it a &#x22;3&#x22; for raw techniques, music, albeit totally misplaced and
gratuitous. And a good performance by Rooney Mara.
