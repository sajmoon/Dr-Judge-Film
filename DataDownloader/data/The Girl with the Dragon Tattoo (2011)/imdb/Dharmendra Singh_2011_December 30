2011_December 30 
Before the opening credits rolled up, I noticed something unusual,
which I don&#x27;t think was the projectionist&#x27;s error. Leo the Lion&#x27;s roar,
the roar which signifies the start of an MGM picture, is muted. It&#x27;s a
portent. It sets us up for something. Shame it wasn&#x27;t anything
interesting.<br /><br />Despite missing Stieg Larsson&#x27;s trilogy and the Swedish film
adaptations, I was optimistic going into this screening because of last
year&#x27;s &#x27;Let Me In&#x27;, another American retelling of another Swedish
original (&#x27;Let the Right One in&#x27;). I should say that I purposely
avoided the books because I have a phobia of the term &#x27;international
best seller&#x27;. I left the cinema unsatisfied, like the many IMDb-ers who
have shared their honest opinion.<br /><br />Daniel Craig plays Mikael Blomkvist, a top journo, recently disgraced
for trying and failing to expose a Swedish magnate. His investigative
skills are famous and attract the attention of Henrik Vanger (a
typically superb Christopher Plummer). Henrik, another magnate, hires
Mikael, ostensibly to write his memoirs, but actually to help uncover
why a niece of his mysteriously disappeared forty years ago.<br /><br />Henrik doesn&#x27;t prevaricate. He tells Mikael to be weary of his family,
who he unhesitatingly calls &#x27;the worst people you will ever meet&#x27; (two
are &#x27;ex&#x27;-Nazis), and to suspect everyone &#x96; including Henrik. Mikael
works from one of Vanger&#x27;s outhouses, keenly trying to keep warm in the
arctic weather (the film is painted in shades which reflect the
bone-numbing cold).<br /><br />Most of my memory of this film is how tedious the storytelling is.
Mikael alternates between his Apple Mac and his wall of notes,
interviewing people in between. I confess I quickly lost track of all
the names, dates and events, which is never as good compared with
knowing all the details and guessing the culprit. Mikael realises he
will not solve the case alone, so requests help. Enter Lisbeth
Salander.<br /><br />The only interesting part of this film, the only reason to part with
your money, isn&#x27;t to find out whodunit, but to see Rooney Mara&#x27;s
unfettered and courageous take on Salander, the film&#x27;s eponymous
heroine. Salander is the ultimate Private Eye-come hacker. Give her two
minutes and she&#x27;ll bring up a list of all your indiscretions, even the
ones you forgot about.<br /><br />As a character, Salander is a fascinating creation. She&#x27;s a
multi-layered enigma. Institutionalised from a young age, she passes
through life as a ghost. Her sexuality is ambiguous. Is she a lesbian?
Bisexual? Judging by the blas&#xE9;, almost mechanical way she stands in
front of her desired match &#x96; male or female &#x96; and simply undresses, I&#x27;d
say she is asexual.<br /><br />There&#x27;s a damning portrait of officialdom: her social worker, the only
person she has real contact with, treats her like a piece of meat. A
vicious rape scene and a subsequent macabre torture sequence are
vintage Fincher.<br /><br />A big distraction was Daniel Craig. I don&#x27;t see him as a cerebral
actor. I would have given the part to Viggo Mortensen, who was
considered. But Craig is Bond, so that means he is second only to God.<br /><br />The film tries to both American and Swedish. Sweden may be the setting,
Swedish may be the characters&#x27; ethnicity, but English, bizarrely, is
the language. Plummer, although spot on, was replaced by Max Von Sydow,
a true Swede, who would have brought authenticity to the artifice.<br /><br />I felt the ending was an anti-climax. Will I be spoiling anything by
saying it&#x27;s the one you suspect from the beginning? I also couldn&#x27;t
understand why Vagner waited 40 years before revisiting the case. Those
sorts of details spoilt it for me.<br /><br />What is it about this story that attracts so many people? It can&#x27;t be
plain old retribution: that would be plain and old. Maybe we&#x27;re
attracted by the notion of superwomen in cinema. Is this a new fetish?
I hope so.<br /><br />www.moseleyb13.com
