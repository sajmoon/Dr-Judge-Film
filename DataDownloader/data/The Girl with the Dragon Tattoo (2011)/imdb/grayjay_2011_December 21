2011_December 21 
My wife and I had read all three books, and saw all three Swedish
movies. We had been so excited about the new &#x22;Hollywood&#x22; movie, and
went to the Tuesday night first showing. <br /><br />The opening credits, while very unusual and visual, were totally
unrelated to the movie. If anything, it was disruptive, and like
watching the credits of a James Bond movie. <br /><br />Having watched the sub-titled Swedish movies, we were looking forward
to the English version. However, so much of the dialog in this movie is
spoken so softly or mumbled, covered with intrusive background music
(or noise!), such that we were wishing for sub-titles in this one!
Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara have perfected talking without moving
one&#x27;s lips.<br /><br />The story was not nearly as well explained as in the Swedish movies. If
one has not read the book, I daresay he will feel very clueless as to
what happened to Mikael at the beginning, and will struggle to
understand what is happening.<br /><br />Our theater was packed for the opening show. I found it interesting
that when it was over, the crowd simply got up and left, without the
kind of excited conversations one hears when people have loved the
movie. I sense that most of our audience shared our feelings....what
was the point of making this movie, when such a wonderful movie had
already been done.
