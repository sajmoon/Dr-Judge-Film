Watch this if...mystery and suspense films are something that interest
you. If you enjoy those type of films, then this is really a great one
to watch.<br /><br />Acting/Casting: 7* - Rooney Mara steals the show in my opinion. She
does a better job than the actress in the Swedish original and is very
good in this film. Daniel Craig is solid, but I thought that his
performance wasn&#x27;t quite as good as the actor in the Swedish original.
The supporting cast is great as well.<br /><br />Directing/Cinematography/Technical: 7* - Much like the original, there
is a lot to cover and my hopes was that this version would be cut down
a bit. I still believe that some of this film could have been
eliminated for a more viewer friendly product. Other than that, the
scenery is great and the directing is spot on.<br /><br />Plot/Characters: 7* - As I mentioned, this is a very good
mystery/suspense film. A journalist under fire and a rogue
hacker/private investigator team up to try and solve an old murder
mystery for a wealthy family. The plot is very intriguing and this is a
well written book and script.<br /><br />Entertainment Value: 6* - I enjoyed the movie, but 2hrs and 40mins is a
bit too long for me with out more action. Again, I would to have liked
to seen it shortened some, but it is still a very solid film.<br /><br />My Score: 7+7+7+6 = 6.75
