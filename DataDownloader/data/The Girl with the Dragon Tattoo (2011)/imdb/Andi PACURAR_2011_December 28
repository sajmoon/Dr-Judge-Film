the initial credits are more interesting than the first half of the
film but it picks up later. <br /><br />A bit uncertain in the reasons for some statements or scenes and then

bit interesting. <br /><br />The end scene is the best. And the end song too!<br /><br />...<br /><br />the initial credits are more interesting than the first half of the
