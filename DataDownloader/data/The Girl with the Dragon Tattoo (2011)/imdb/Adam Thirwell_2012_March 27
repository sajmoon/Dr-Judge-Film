I&#x27;ve not read the book or seen the original Swedish film, but I&#x27;m more
than willing to go to the cinema to see a new David Fincher film...
more often than not, his films have impeccable cinematography and sound
design. These are both present in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but,
as a film, I found it underwhelming and verging on genre silliness. The
film it reminded me of the most is the Charles Bronson vigilante drama
Death Wish... here, our lead actress (who plays an unknowable, almost
Bronson-like cypher) is violated and seeks revenge. The violation is
nasty, fetishised and dwelled upon by the filmmakers for too long, and
the revenge is comic book and simplistic.<br /><br />This &#x27;cause then consequence&#x27; narrative structure continues throughout
the film - it&#x27;s very formulaic. The plot about dark family secrets is
rather stodgy, although it would like to be edgy, like the Danish dogme
melodrama Festen. There is excruciatingly awful dialogue in the sex
scene between Daniel Craig and The Girl, the climactic action scene
underwhelms on a genre level, and the long, drawn out coda had people
in the cinema heading for the exit early.
