This is a long movie, very heavy on dialogue but the plot is actually
quite simple. The identity of the villain is pretty obvious.<br /><br />I have to say that I found this film to be extremely and relentlessly
boring. The story could have been told in half of the running time
allocated to this film.<br /><br />The less than charismatic actors don&#x27;t help either. Rooney Mara is
better but she has a more interesting character. Lisbeth is eccentric
but still not interesting enough to sustain the film.<br /><br />Daniel Craig gives a boring performance of a boring character. The
number of times I checked my watch while watching this was beyond
belief.<br /><br />I hope the movie doesn&#x27;t get sequels.
