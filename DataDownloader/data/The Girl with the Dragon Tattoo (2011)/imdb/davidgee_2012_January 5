2012_January 5 
I approached this without preconceptions, having neither read the books
nor seen the Swedish movie version. This big-budget version has an
appropriately Scandinavian feel to it: bleak, wintry and dark. Some of
the characters attempt a vaguely Nordic accent; others (including
Daniel Craig) wisely do not.<br /><br />The movie gets off to a slow start and goes on far too long. The pace
only picks up when Mikael realises he&#x27;s pursuing a serial killer and
recruits Lisbeth to help with his research. The unmasking of the killer
is not an enormous surprise, and the killer&#x27;s &#x27;back story&#x27; is out there
in the twilight zone with the early life of Hannibal Lecter.<br /><br />Craig is much better cast in this kind of movie than as Pierce
Brosnan&#x27;s substitute. Rooney Mara will be an actress to look out for,
although I thought the SM scenes with her lard-ass &#x27;guardian&#x27; were
superfluous to the central plot and a bit too unpleasant to watch. An
interesting movie, but often tedious and only intermittently thrilling.
