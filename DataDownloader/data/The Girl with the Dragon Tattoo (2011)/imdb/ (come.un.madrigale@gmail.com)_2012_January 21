While the Swedish original was a very good film, with very good
performances (especially from Noomi Rapace and Peter Haber), this 2nd
adaption comes out superior. I love how Rooney Mara&#x27;s take on Salander
expands on yet more levels, taking Mara up to the heights of acting
legends. I doubt I&#x27;ve ever seen a more complete and convincing
performance from an American actress. Daniel Craig is also perfect in
the role of Blomkvist, while the Reznor &#x26; Ross soundtrack is absolutely
incredible. I went twice to the cinema to see this film, and I&#x27;m not
the least disappointed having seen it twice in a short period of time.
This is a masterpiece.
