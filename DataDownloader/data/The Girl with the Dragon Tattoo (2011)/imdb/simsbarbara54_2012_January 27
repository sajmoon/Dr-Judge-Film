the original version of the girl with the dragon tattoo (2009) was the
best movie. Noomi Rapace was and still is the better actress. plus why
is it, that the American version of Lisbeth Salanderthe is so dirty and
filthy. in the original film she was clean and nice. yes she had
tattoos and a Mohawk hair stile and body piercing but she was very
clean and intelligent and nice. But, the American version totally made
her look like a slut, prostitute. Americans stereotyping people. Even
Daniel Craig should have declined this role he is not better than
Michael Nyqvist actually, Michael Nyqvist is better than he is. People
go get the original 2009 version of the movie on DVD. that is the only
one must see version.
