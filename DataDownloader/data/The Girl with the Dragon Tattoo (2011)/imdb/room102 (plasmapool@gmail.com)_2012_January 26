I didn&#x27;t like the original movie and I don&#x27;t like this remake either.
Except for the main titles, which were cool, I found the entire movie
boring, EXTREMELY long and very badly written (the entire plot is
pretty useless and doesn&#x27;t really lead to the revealed truth - and
that&#x27;s a bad psychology thriller/mystery writing). I had to FORCE
myself to watch the movie. At the end, after over 2 hours, I finally
cracked and started to fast forward.<br /><br />I came to like Daniel Craig since I (re-)watched his impressive
performance in The Jacket. However, I wasn&#x27;t impressed by any of the
cast members in this movie. I don&#x27;t remember the original movie, so I
can&#x27;t compare Rooney Mara&#x27;s performance to that of Noomi Rapace. It
seemed to me like she&#x27;s playing a &#x22;simple&#x22; depressed Emo girl, nothing
more. The violent scene was indeed impressive in its shock value, but I
don&#x27;t think that alone deserves an Oscar nomination.<br /><br />Like Tarsem Singh, I appreciate Fincher&#x27;s style (although I wasn&#x27;t
impressed with his direction of &#x22;The Social Network&#x22; and &#x22;The Girl with
the Dragon Tattoo&#x22;), but I don&#x27;t connect to most of his movies. It
seems to me like his fans (especially since &#x22;The Social Network&#x22;) would
eat anything he makes, even if it stinks to high heavens. Not to
mention that the movie is over 2.5 hours long! Was it really necessary?
Yeah, the original movie was also that long, but it doesn&#x27;t justify the
length of either of them.<br /><br />3.5/10 Avoid
