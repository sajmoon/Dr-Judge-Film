2012_January 28 
I have to say that like most people I hadn&#x27;t heard of the Millennium
series or Stieg Larsson before his death. Upon hearing all the fuss
about the books I wanted to see for myself if this was one of those
posthumous things. Well as many of you know it wasn&#x27;t and the three
books are some of the very best in their kind. Now I have read them and
have recommended them almost to anyone I know and asks me about a good
book.<br /><br />That said about the books before watching the American version (and
having watched the Swedish versions) I have to admit I was expecting to
be disappointed in that I didn&#x27;t expect it to be better or even the
same as its Swedish counterpart. Well it was one of the best movies I
saw in 2011 along with Drive.<br /><br />Some people say that it does not smell of Sweden. Well the movie is a
Hollywood film, and you can&#x27;t expect from someone not of Swedish
culture to depict aspects of Sweden as they truly are (they even forgot
that Sweden uses Celcius and not Fahrenheit). If you judge the movie
objectively and without having in mind the books and how much stuff
from the books are missing as I hear a lot (which is true but also
shouldn&#x27;t matter) you will see that this movie as what it truly is, a
thriller that won&#x27;t let you stop watching even for a minute.<br /><br />I also heard a lot that the movie has a lot of sex scenes and more
nudity than it should. Well to those people I say that you are going to
watch a thriller describing some of the darkest aspects of the human
soul and mind so you can&#x27;t expect unicorns and fairies except if they
were carrying shotguns. I won&#x27;t go as far to say that nudism is a form
of art, I leave that to history to judge, but I truly didn&#x27;t mind about
the sex and nude scenes in this movie.<br /><br />Enough of review other people&#x27;s thoughts about the movie though. Rooney
Mara is exceptional playing as Lisbeth Salander dark and showing that
feeling of ambivalence we all have for her actions and truly deserves
her nomination. Daniel Craig showed that he in not only good as James
Bond but is capable of great emotion as well. All the cast performed
very well and David Fincher used their assets to make an excellent
film.<br /><br />All in all I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has read the
books or has seen the Swedish adaptations of the books and wants to
compare, or anyone who wants to see a good thriller and an excellent
movie.
