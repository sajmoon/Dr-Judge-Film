Although I&#x27;ve read all three of the books (structurally, they&#x27;re really
3 installments of one big honking novel), I haven&#x27;t seen the Swedish
movies. Forget about the books. Forget about the other movies. On its
own, this adaptation does manage to capture the general tone and
resonance of the novels, and it does this with admirable brevity and
to-the-bone editing. There is a bleakness in the novels that is nicely
encapsulated by the exterior and interior backgrounds. Snow. The
sterility of Martin Vanger&#x27;s modern house on the hill. The cool patina
of years on the old cottage&#x27;s walls, furniture, and stonework. The
camera dwells on Lizbeth Salander&#x27;s inexpressive face and you can
almost hear her complex gears spinning away. The lighting director in
this film is a genius -- and so is the cinematographer -- emotions are
relayed in light and shadow so well, and the camera angles nudge our
tensions without being overt about it. It&#x27;s not perfect, of course. No
movie version of a well-plotted novel ever is. But it strives to do the
story justice, and manages to accomplish its task.
