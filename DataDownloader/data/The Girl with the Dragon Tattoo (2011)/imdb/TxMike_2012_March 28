I am generally NOT a fan of re-makes, especially one so close in time
to the original (2011 vs 2009). But this is such a rich, interesting
story that they pull it off quite well. The story remains set and
filmed (mostly) in Sweden, each character uses his or her version of a
Swedish accent. But it is a more elaborate production and takes the
whole story up a notch. <br /><br />In my comments on the 2009 movie I wrote, &#x22;All the characters are good,
but I can&#x27;t say enough about Rapace as Lisbeth. She creates a character
as memorable as any. More closely akin to Nikita than anything else.&#x22;
Now I must echo that for Rooney Mara. Who would have thought, from her
role in &#x27;The Social Network&#x27;? She deserved the Oscar nomination and it
would not been wrong if she had won. <br /><br />Daniel Craig is the investigative reporter, Mikael Blomkvist.
Christopher Plummer is Henrik Vanger, who hires him to re-look at the
disappearance 40 years earlier of his niece. And Stellan Skarsg&#xE5;rd is
Martin Vanger. In an interesting casting Robin Wright is Erika Berger .<br /><br />The story follows the same arc but some of the story elements are
presented differently, often in more detail. The scenes with Lisbeth
and her dastardly guardian are more graphic. In the original Blomkvist
has to spend 3 months in jail after his conviction, here it appears he
only has to pay a large fine. And there is another key difference I
will mention below after &#x22;spoilers.&#x22; <br /><br />Overall an excellent movie, and since I saw the 2009 version about 10
months ago, this one was very fresh to me. I hope they make the second
and third ones too, but that seems to be in doubt right now. <br /><br />SPOILERS: As in the original Nazi Martin Vanger was the perpetrator of
many unsolved killings, and he was responsible for the niece&#x27;s
disappearance, she fled because she was afraid. In the original she was
found in Australia. In this version she was found practicing law in
London under a different name. After Martin&#x27;s death in a fiery car
crash she was able to reconcile with her family.
