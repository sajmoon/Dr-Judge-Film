Let me start off by saying that I went into this movie knowing next to
nothing about its plot. I have never even picked up the book, and I
never watched the Swedish version of the film, despite hearing enormous
praise for both. With that being said, I was blown away with this
movie.&#xA0;<br /><br />First and foremost, whether you like him or not, David Fincher makes
good movies. You&#x27;d be hard-pressed to find a director that is more
meticulous and intricate than he is. In the first hour of this movie,
Fincher&#x27;s extreme attention to detail is almost overwhelming. Not
having any background knowledge of the story, I found myself struggling
to keep up. I was lost with the story, I was confused about who these
characters were, and to put it bluntly I felt totally in the dark. But
the story reached its climax and Fincher shed light on it all. The
story came together, I understood the nature of the characters, and I
was impressed. All of a sudden, a story that I knew nothing about, made
sense to me and I loved it. After the plot&#x27;s unravelling I was totally
glued and did not want the film to end.&#xA0;<br /><br />This isn&#x27;t like most movies. Yeah, it&#x27;s a murder mystery. Yes, it&#x27;s a
psychological thriller. And of course, it is ridden with gratuitous
violence and sex. But it is also a love story. I went home and
immediately watched the Swedish version, and I didn&#x27;t feel the passion
that I felt from Fincher&#x27;s. It&#x27;s true, Mara is not as &#x22;strong&#x22; or
aggressive as Rapace, but that&#x27;s what I loved. She&#x27;s vulnerable. It was
a remarkable performance on her part to capture the cold and ruthless
side of Lizbeth, but at the same time expose the soft side as well.&#xA0;I
think Mara has turned in the best female acting performance of the
year, and I hope she receives the credit she deserves.<br /><br />I hope they complete the series because I&#x27;m riveted. I went again to
only further appreciate the film&#x27;s intricacies, and I can say that I&#x27;m
hooked. This movie is well-acted, well-produced, and phenomenally
executed. You will not be disappointed.
