Obviously I thought that this film was absolutely flawless, albeit
gruesome. I think it was a wonderful adaptation of the novel, and the
acting was absolutely astounding. It has a wonderful score, wonderful
editing, wonderful cinematography, etc.<br /><br />I think the one thing that gets to me is the amount of people assuming
this film is a remake of the Swedish version; or that the Swedish
version is considered the &#x22;original.&#x22; I find that humorous because The
Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (2011) wasn&#x27;t based off of the Swedish
version, it was based off of the novel. They&#x27;re two separate film
trilogies, based off of the same novel.<br /><br />I feel as though Rooney played Lisbeth a tad better than Noomi, simply
because Rooney has the ability to be completely and truly androgynous,
while also being incredibly attractive while also terrifying you with
her looks at the same time. Not to mention her ability to absolutely
remove all emotion at just the right moments is phenomenal.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love Noomi; she&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous and
wonderful at acting. However Noomi, while also a good Lisbeth, isn&#x27;t
androgynous enough for me. She never makes you second glance and ask,
&#x22;What gender am I looking at?&#x22; I also don&#x27;t find her face empty enough
like I do with Rooney&#x27;s. Which is also why I enjoyed the bleaching of
Rooney&#x27;s eyebrows, to help rid her of showing any emotion.<br /><br />I could spend hours talking about why I enjoyed this film so much, and
explaining my love of Rooney and her role as the new Lisbeth, but to
sum it up: the film was impeccable as was the acting. It honestly
deserves an Oscar.
