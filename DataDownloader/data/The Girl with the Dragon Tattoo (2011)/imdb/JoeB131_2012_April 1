2012_April 1 
Based on the Swedish film of the same name which I only watched half an
hour of because it was so mind-numbingly boring.<br /><br />This one was almost as boring, and it drags on for an agonizing three
hours.<br /><br />It doesn&#x27;t help the film that the two principals don&#x27;t meet until an
hour and a quarter into it. It&#x27;s like you are watching two movies that
kind of crash into each other about halfway through, and the actions of
a lot of the characters don&#x27;t make a lick of sense.<br /><br />Daniel Craig is actually pretty good in this, not so much the female
lead, who is unlikable as a character. The whole mystery plot is kind
of dull. And just when you think it&#x27;s over, nope, we have another 20
minutes of plot to go...
