This film might as well have been made in Cleveland as in Stockholm.
There&#x27;s nothing remotely Swedish about the two main characters, Daniel
Craig as Mikael Blomqvist and Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander. Craig is
his generic-action-figure self and Mara lacks the edginess that made
Noomi Rapace so distinctive as Lisbeth -- attractive and repulsive at
the same time. Only Christopher Plummer is really suited to his role.<br /><br />The makers of the American film have tampered with the plot in some
ways, simplifying it at the expense sometimes of confusing what is
clear in the first novel of the Stieg Larrson&#x27; trilogy. But that&#x27;s
considerably less of a problem than the failure to evoke the atmosphere
and the context of the original. <br /><br />It will be interesting to see what becomes of Robin Wright as Erika
Berger in later episodes. Her position as Mikael&#x27;s lover having been
reduced in this telling, it may prove difficult to establish her
central role in the plots of the two remaining parts of the trilogy.<br /><br />A word more about Noomi Rapace. It&#x27;s been said that she was unwilling
to reprise her role as Lisabeth in the American films. I&#x27;m inclined to
believe that she might have changed her mind if enough money had been
offered. Certainly, the role in which she is expected to make her
American debut will make much less of a splash than she would have made
as Lisbeth. Rooney Mara is okay as Lisbeth and may one day be a star.
Rapace was as memorable on film as Lisbeth was in the trilogy. As for
language, I assume that like every Swede I&#x27;ve ever known, Rapace must
be able to speak English and, if she has a Swedish accent, so much the
better. At least one of the characters in the film ought to have seemed
Swedish.
