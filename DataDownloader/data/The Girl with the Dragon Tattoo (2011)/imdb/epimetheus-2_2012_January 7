For those who watched the previous Swedish films (but not read the
books), this movie is pretty good. In fact, it honestly felt like I was
just re-watching the film again for the second time -- there were few
differences between the two of them.<br /><br />Overall, I felt that the Swedish version had a little more weight to
it, but if you have a serious aversion to foreign-language films, this
movie does a good job of making you feel like you didn&#x27;t miss anything
as far as a &#x27;remake&#x27; is concerned.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you can watch the Swedish versions, I&#x27;d recommend
them either instead, or watching them sometime -- either before
watching the English versions, or later.<br /><br />It&#x27;s hard for me to get into why I felt the Swedish version was better
without revealing spoilers, but suffice to say that this version isn&#x27;t
bad either. I gave the Swedish version a 9/10, and I&#x27;m giving this an
8/10.<br /><br />Hope this helps.
