It&#x27;s dark and intriguing, the English-language version of the
best-selling Stieg Larsson novel is memorable as its Swedish
counterpart that was released two years ago. Somehow very disturbing,
mesmerizing, with the tone beginning in the opening credits, which are
a wonder to behold, and continuing up to the last frame, the story is
also enhanced by an excellent soundtrack. Though Daniel Craig&#x27;s Mikael
is interesting, it&#x27;s the character of Lisbeth which fascinates the most
and affects the audience. Mara infuses her character with gloom and
rage. This is certainly more than another mystery but a story of
revenge, mental issues and ghastly secrets.
