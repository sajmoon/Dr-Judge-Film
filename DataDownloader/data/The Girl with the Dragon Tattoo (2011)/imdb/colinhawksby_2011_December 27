This was the movie that has been shoved in our faces as the next big
thing for all this time?? I am always a little suspicious when
something has to be sold so hard as a work of genius and in this case
my suspicions were well founded.<br /><br />It cannot be denied that the leading lady gives a very fine performance
but its wasted in this movie.<br /><br />There were times when I was appalled and repulsed, which I&#x27;m sure was
the writers intent but it was pointless as I was never *involved*.I
didn&#x27;t care what happened next. There were times when I just wanted the
movie to stop. <br /><br />At the end I just felt that I&#x27;d wasted my time watching this.
Apparently the film&#x27;s box office means that the sequels might not be
made. Good. Let&#x27;s hope it frees RM to do something more worthy of her
talents than this rubbish.
