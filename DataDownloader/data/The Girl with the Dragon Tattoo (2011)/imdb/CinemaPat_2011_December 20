2011_December 20 
Let me preface this by saying that I haven&#x27;t yet read the books or seen
the original Swedish films. I will have a full review of this version
as it compares to the original films soon.<br /><br />David Fincher (Fight Club, The Social Network) put together a tight and
suspenseful film. I thought the acting was great, specifically from
Rooney Mara who plays &#x22;the girl&#x22;. She is phenomenal and one of the
sexiest characters I&#x27;ve seen on screen this year. Daniel Craig was
good, but didn&#x27;t blow me away. He was still James Bond, but now with
reading glasses. The pacing and script were wonderful, but I thought
Fincher foreshadowed the ending and also felt that they should have
re-arranged the conclusions a bit. There were a few story lines that
came to a close at different times.....so when one ended you still had
a couple more to get through. Unfortunately the first story line that
comes to a close is the most intense one so the remaining time is kind
of &#x22;meh&#x22; to the viewer since they invested so much emotion in the first
storyline. Hope that makes sense. It was a great movie, but if you&#x27;ve
seen the originals you may want to wait until this one goes to DVD/br.
Full review to come.
