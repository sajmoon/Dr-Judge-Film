2012_January 7 
I try to stay away from details if I give a review of something. I do
not like to spoil the movie for others.<br /><br />If you have read the book, prepare to be somewhat disappointed. The way
things happen in the book, and what happens (or doesn&#x27;t, or are
completely made up) are entirely different things.<br /><br />I saw the original Swedish version of all three films. They stuck much
closer to the books, however, the subtitles were lacking at times. The
fault I find with the American version of this film is that it
seemingly tries too hard not to replicate the Swedish films.
Replication is not a bad thing when it reflects how the story was
actually written. When you see the film and your brain is yelling
&#x22;that&#x27;s not how it happened at all!&#x22;, you tend not to be as happy as
you would be if the movie were putting the characters you had read of
into real people, doing what happened in the book.<br /><br />Now, if you have not read the books, you won&#x27;t have the same
perspective. The only thing I could write for the people who have not
yet read the books is this: The movie is slow for about the first hour.
After that it picks up and is a decent show. <br /><br />As for the lower rating, the reason I feel it deserves a 6 rather than
a higher score is only because they do not follow the books as closely
as they should have in my opinion.
