Chilling, haunting and relentlessly thrilling, director David Fincher
has created the definitive film adaptation of Larssons best seller
whilst at the same time improving on the source material. A brilliant
performance from Rooney Mara only elevates the film to greater heights <br /><br />The Review:<br /><br />Ill cut to the chase: this is everything fans of the books could have
hoped for, its miles better than the already good Swedish film, its
more faithful to the novel, in some places it actually improves on the
source material.<br /><br />With &#x22;The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo&#x22; David Fincher has put his
trademark darkness to fantastic use. Whether its sweeping shots of
freezing, snow covered Sweden or wonderfully eerie interiors Fincher
creates an unsettling atmosphere that is unrelenting and technically
perfect. With Fincher i&#x27;ve learnt to expect a beautifully shot film and
this is no exception, within this film are some of his greatest images.
Regarding the disturbing nature of some scenes, Fincher is wise enough
to show them in all their horror but doesn&#x27;t stop to linger or exploit.<br /><br />The performances are perfect all round, Its clear Fincher and the
casting production went to great lengths to pick not only great actors
but those who embody the very essence of their characters. Of note in
the supporting characters are Yorick van Wageningen who plays the
sadistic Bjurman with unsettling believability and the always great
Christopher plummer who is note-perfect as the desperate, loney
grandfather Henrik .- As one part of our central duo Daniel Craig puts
in his finest performance, normally cast as the tough hero Craig is
more subdued here, he has Blomkvist easy charm down to a T but also
captures the weak, submissive aspect of his character. - Lisbeth
Salander is a character unlike anything fiction has ever
seen&#x85;.broken,pierced, clade in leather with short black hair and a body
so slight the wind could break her, she is horribly victimised but
refuses to be one. To sum it up she is one of the most interesting and
difficult characters an actress could ever play. I could honestly write
a whole review on the brilliance of Rooney Mara&#x27;s performance, she is
the very essence of Lisbeth&#x85;as if the character just walked off the
page. Mara commands every scene with a mixture of silent burning rage
and a deep rooted venerability. Her eyes are the heart of the film, her
reactions are the reason myself and the others around me laughed,
gasped and even cried. The character requires an actress who can
internalize her emotions yet at the same time convay a wide range of
feelings. Mara does this such perfect skill, every glance is charged
with deep feeling as if you&#x27;re looking directly into her soul. A brave
performance, Mara bares all in the nude scenes and goes to frankly
horribly dark places in the now informous scenes of sexual violence.
Watching Rooney Mara is witnessing the birth of a star, this is the
best performance of the year and if the Oscars fail to reconzie her i
will lose all hope in their judgment. <br /><br />The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is perfect, eerie and
unsettling. It is as good as their Oscar winning score last year if not
better, its more understated and does what every score should
do....improves the scenes not overpower them.<br /><br />This is by and large a perfect adaptation, my main issue lay with one
singe sequence. There is a shot that seems to be there solely for the
purpose of showing off, it serves no real purpose within the story. <br /><br />The most touching scenes of the film come from the characters
themselves, this is a character driven story and none are more powerful
than Lisbeth and Mikeal themselves. Fincher makes their relationship
the focus and it pays off, they are the heart of the books and Fincher
rightfully recognises this. <br /><br />Proving that sometimes &#x22;american&#x22; adaptations can actually be for the
better this is a film nobody should miss...its everything the novel is,
plus some. More than anything i was impressed by the humour that is
added through-out, this film will make you laugh, it will break your
heart and it will make you want to take a shower.
