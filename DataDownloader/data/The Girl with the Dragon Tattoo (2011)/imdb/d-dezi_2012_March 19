I wanted to like this movie I truly did but it just can not compare
with the Swedish film. Everyone has their own opinion but to me this
film was lacking and I could not stay focused as opposed to its Swedish
&#xA0;counter part which I couldn&#x27;t take my eyes off of. 1st is Rooney Mara
as Lisbeth Salander she gave an OK performance I believe that they were
many other actress that could have done a better job. &#xA0;Noomi Rapace
(the original Lisbeth) owned the role one of the most captivating
performances I have ever seen! People say this version is closer to the
book and in some aspects it is! But it&#x27;s a boring movie. I&#x27;m an
American I love American cinema, I don&#x27;t mind read subtitles but I&#x27;d
rather not have to. Believe me when I say the Swedish version has a
better dialog, a way better cast and is overall a much better story.
I&#x27;m sorry for the fans of this film but there was truly no need to
remake this story after the Swedish people did an excellent job
transform a book from their nation into film. Two thumbs down for me
