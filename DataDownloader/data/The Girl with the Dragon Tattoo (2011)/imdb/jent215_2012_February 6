OK I just saw this movie and it was really good. I think there are some
very intense moments that made me very uncomfortable to watch. I think
most people agree to that. If you read the books you know that its
coming, but still hard to watch it and not sure we needed to see as
much as we did. But, the acting was superb! I was also reading of
Rooney&#x27;s transformation for the character, all her piercing and stuff.
That is very commendable that she went so far to embrace the character.
I&#x27;m not an actor but I don&#x27;t think I could go that far for one movie.
impressive. I agree that it is very dialogue driven, and there are a
lot of moments that might have come across as slow moving. But the
actors kept it so interesting I was not bored at all. they are both
very talented actors. I would recommend it. But read the book first!
