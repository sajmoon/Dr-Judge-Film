The original (2009) movie version of the book was gripping, stylish,
and original. This version, while adequate, adds nothing to the
original. Hollywood&#x27;s mania for remakes of everything notwithstanding,
it is difficult to see why this movie was remade at all. The film only
differs from the original in that it offers a laughably cheesy intro
filled with meaningless MTV-style graphics and a ludicrous version of
Led Zeppelin&#x27;s already overblown (but great as it is) &#x22;Immigrant Song&#x22;.
The score, by Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor and partner Atticus
Ross is better than average, but this minor addition does not justify
remaking a million dollar movie. Please, Hollywood, enough with the
remakes of movies, TV shows, comic books, and the like!
