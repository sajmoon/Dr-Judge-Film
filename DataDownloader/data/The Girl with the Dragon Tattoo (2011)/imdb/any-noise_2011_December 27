If, like me, you&#x27;ve read the books and seen the Swedish adaptations
you&#x27;re probably itching to see what Daniel Craig, Rooney Mara and
director David Fincher have got to offer. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.<br /><br />Set in Sweden, the story follows journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Craig)
and his &#x27;research assistant&#x27; Lisbeth Salander (Mara) as they attempt to
solve an old murder case and, in the process, uncover some pretty dirty
family secrets.<br /><br />Despite the epic running time (over 2.5hrs) this is a master-class in
cinematic tension and it&#x27;s even worse if you know what&#x27;s coming &#x96; I
spent most of the film poised to cover my eyes for the Bjurman/Salander
scenes.<br /><br />Mara is outstanding as Salander. Her natural prettiness is just about
disguised (all those piercings are real) and although she plays a more
self-assured version of Salander, her social awkwardness still feels
authentic.<br /><br />My only rant is over the accents. Craig doesn&#x27;t even attempt a Swedish
accent but everyone else is giving it a go. In every other way he has
&#x27;de-Bonded&#x27;, but that accent&#x85; Plus they&#x27;ve changed the ending, but I
probably shouldn&#x27;t tell you any more about that.<br /><br />@any_noise
