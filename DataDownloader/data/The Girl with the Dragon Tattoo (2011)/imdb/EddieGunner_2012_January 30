well well i thought that after destroying Let the right one in (L&#xE5;t den
R&#xE4;tte Komma in) by making such a s**t remake Hollywood won&#x27;t do it
similar things anymore but they had to like always they need to destroy
things <br /><br />Girl with dragon tattoo (M&#xE4;n Som Hatar Kvinnor) is great movie, great
acting and directing everything, so David Fincher thought he can earn
so made re-make of the same movie with same story just with Hollywood
stars who honestly sucked in this, special girl who acted Lisbeth she
ain&#x27;t up knees to Noomi Rapace who did same role in original, <br /><br />anyway this is one more tragedy that come from united states of
Hollywood from directors who don&#x27;t have anymore ideas so they are
stealing from others and when u doing a re-make you need to do it
better if u can&#x27;t get the f*** of it,,,,,,,, <br /><br />if u really wanna do favor to people don&#x27;t do other two from trilogy
