2012_January 5 
Having waited before committing to try out this story - I&#x27;ve been
burned before and really hated &#x27;rated&#x27; oddball films/book
adaptations/translations, I have to admit this flick really does pack a
punch. A worthy effort that belies the author&#x27;s knowledge and
understanding of an underworld we hardly ever get to see properly.
Casting was spot on - I really can&#x27;t believe that George Clooney was
even considered for a role - he&#x27;s far too full of himself and that&#x27;s
what is telling about the acting in this film. Everything spoken is
almost understated - there is a delicacy in the way people in the
Nordic countries speak that contrasts with the weight of what they say.
This was perfectly conveyed in the English version of the story. Full
marks for that and for making us believe that these English speakers
were not English/American. I am now convinced that I will gain more
from the books and will likely revisit the film again afterwards. ps.
Now got the book and on first impressions this film is faithful to the
intent of the novel (some variations for obvious cinematic reasons with
information derived from the 2nd book &#x22;The Girl Who Played with Fire&#x22;).
