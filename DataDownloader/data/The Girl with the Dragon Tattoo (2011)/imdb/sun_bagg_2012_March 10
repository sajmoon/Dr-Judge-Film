I stumbled upon the &#x22;Millennium series&#x22; in 2010, while I was browsing
through internet. The cover of the book looked interesting enough for
me to place an order for it. By the time book had arrived I had gained
some information about the author and his rather unfortunate demise. It
seemed quite mystifying to me that author died shortly after handing
his manuscripts to the publisher. <br /><br />Any ways, as I started reading it; I knew that I will like it for sure.
As it happens with most readers, I too had a mental picture of how
Lisbeth would look in real life.<br /><br />For me she was a real character, a real person, whom I dreamt of
meeting one day and telling her how awesome she is. As u may have
guessed, by the time I finished reading the first book I had ordered
the next two instalments already.<br /><br />Then I heard about a movie series based on the trilogy. The problem was
where I could find them. Finally I caught 20 minutes of the &#x22;The girl
who played with fire&#x22; Swedish version on HBO.Was the movie good
enough?Did Noomi Rapace justify the character of Lisbeth Salander. From
what I could make out of 20 minutes of movie,the answer was &#x22;yes&#x22;. Of
course I had imagined Lisebth Salander a bit differently but she was
close enough. I had also expected Mikael Blomkvist to be a bit more
charming. <br /><br />Then came the news of English version of &#x22;The Girl with the Dragon
Tattoo&#x22; directed by David Fincher, starring Daniel Craig as Mikael
Blomkvist and Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander about whom I had never
heard before. I was Excited and why wouldn&#x27;t I be. After all Daniel
fitted into my image of Mikael Perfectly but I had my doubts about
Rooney. <br /><br />Finally the day came when movie released but to my utter disappointment
its release in India was delayed. Date of its release was set as 10 Feb
2012.So I was looking forward to that day and reviews about the movie
only added to my anxiousness. But fate wasn&#x27;t on my side. Movie was
cancelled in India due to some images in movie which&#x22; Indian censor
board&#x22; found disturbing. What can I say other than, I hated them for it
and I even wrote them an e-mail expressing my utter disappointment.
Somehow I got my hands on its Blu-Ray version from someplace. <br /><br />Finally came the judgement day. To tell you honestly, how did 2 and a
half hours went by, I Don&#x27;t remember. It was like reading the book
again but even better. Lisebth was exactly what I had imagined her to
be. Everything was just &#x22;PERFECT&#x22;. The acting, screenplay, direction,
music,everything was top notch. I have nothing but only good things to
say about the movie. It was an experience worth having. Rooney Mara
played Lisbeth Salander perfectly and Daniel Craig left no stone
unturned. It felt good to finally see my mental image of Lisbeth take
shape flawlessly. <br /><br />I have rated the movie a 10/10 in IMDb, because it accomplished its
purpose and much more. I felt so deeply moved after watching the movie,
that I sat down and Wrote this review. I am really looking forward to
next instalment in the series. <br /><br />Finally I would like to end my review with these lines from the
movie... <br /><br />Dragan : &#x22;She is different&#x22;<br /><br />Dirch:&#x22;In what way?&#x22; <br /><br />Dragan:&#x22;In every way!&#x22;
