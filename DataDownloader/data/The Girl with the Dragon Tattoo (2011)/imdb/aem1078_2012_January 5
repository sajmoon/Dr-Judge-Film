I am a huge fan of both the original books, and the Swedish movies, but
this movie is a major improvement on the Swedish movie. Essentially,
the books could be used as movie scripts, with little done to alter
them, and this movie pretty much does that. My biggest complaint is
that Lisbeth appears to be wearing &#x22;gang pants&#x22; instead of Goth pants
throughout the movie. I don&#x27;t see her wearing pants with the crotch
around her mid-thighs, as that would restrict her movement too much,
and she is more likely to be wearing skin-tight pants.<br /><br />They did a good job with the denouement at the end, with Hans Erik
Wennerstrom, and also the concluding segment is excellently done.
Overall, I was skeptical going in about this movie, and came out
excited about seeing the remaining two movies. The original Swedish
movies are not nearly as good as they could be on Girl Who Played with
Fire and Girl Who Kicked the Hornets&#x27; Nest. They portrayed the
Millennium staff as a bunch of gutless wimps, when in the books, they
were journalists like Steig Larsson, willing to risk their lives to get
the truth out to the public! I hope that these productions will stay
true to the books on this!
