David Fincher in recent years has grown to become one of America&#x27;s best
known directors working today. He has an interesting, oftentimes dark
visual style that he features, and usually he has an interesting story
to tell. Unfortunately, in this film, the story is just not interesting
enough. It&#x27;s kind of a typical murder mystery film, with some twists
and turns, and an ending that really isn&#x27;t too shocking. What raises
this up from being completely mediocre is Rooney Mara&#x27;s performance as
the title character. Otherwise, this story here doesn&#x27;t have enough
weight or originality to stand out over other pretty good mystery
films.<br /><br />Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is a journalist who&#x27;s fallen out of
favor after possible slanderous reporting. He is called upon by Henrik
Vanger (Christopher Plummer), the ex- CEO of a company, to solve the
mystery of his missing and presumed dead niece who disappeared 40 years
ago. He ends up being partnered with an anti-social computer hacker,
Lisbeth (Rooney Mara), who uses her skill and research to help solve
the case. <br /><br />Mikael and Lisbeth (&#x22;The girl with the dragon tattoo&#x22;) don&#x27;t meet up
until halfway through the film, and the first half features them each
working separately. All the scenes in the first half of the film
focusing on Lisbeth are very interesting. While Mikael gets immediately
thrown into the main story, Lisbeth is given almost a character study
(that furthers along the plot) for the first half of the film. Rooney
Mara is really great here, giving the character layers, with such
understated acting. The character is emotionally disturbed and
apparently &#x22;crazy&#x22; but any trait is hidden beneath this straight and
unflinching face. Daniel Craig&#x27;s character, on the other hand, is not
nearly as interesting, and for some reason, he mumbles here a lot, so
he&#x27;s also hard to understand at times. The mystery he&#x27;s trying to solve
is interesting conceptually, but visually it&#x27;s often hard to convey
excitement when he&#x27;s sitting alone reading up on research.<br /><br />When the characters finally meet, about 75 minutes into this 160 minute
behemoth, the mystery story gels a bit more, mainly because Daniel
Craig finally has someone interesting to interact with. Where the film
is lacking is largely in the story. The revelation at the end as to the
connections of murders, and potential villains aren&#x27;t that interesting.
The resolution of the film must take darned near 30 minutes, and the
main thing I took away from the film, was what a great performance Ms.
Mara gave, and what an interesting character she played. The plot is
by-the-numbers mystery, and the film does at times drag. David
Fincher&#x27;s direction is alright, but he doesn&#x27;t make researching the
murder much more than mundane. He throws in a few disorienting
movements of the camera&#x27;s placement, but other than that, this doesn&#x27;t
feel like a really great David Fincher directed film. It feels more
like an O.K. mystery thriller, that has a great performance, some tense
moments, and overall just kind of slips out of one&#x27;s memory after a
while. <br /><br />This film isn&#x27;t bad by any means, it just doesn&#x27;t have enough going for
it to make it anything more than somewhat generic, other than the
character of Lisbeth. It is overlong, though not bloated, and really
not a lot could have been cut out without either cutting the story, or
getting rid of good character scenes. The mystery is sort of
interesting, but not nearly engaging enough. The final scene in the
film was very good however, and mixed character development with a sort
of sadness, giving the film a bittersweet feeling. The title character
basically saves this film, and rises it above mediocrity, though not
quite enough above.<br /><br />My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 160 mins. R for violence, sexuality and
brief nudity.
