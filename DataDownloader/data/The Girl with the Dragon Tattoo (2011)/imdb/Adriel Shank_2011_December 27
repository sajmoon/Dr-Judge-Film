I have seen the Swedish films, yet not read the books. The US version
is not a remake of the Swedish version; it is simply another adaptation
of the novel. I must say I was very impressed with the pacing and
over-all style and raw feeling of the US version of The Girl With the
Dragon Tattoo. The story, whether from the books, Swedish version or US
version is quite a dark and winding journey. If you have not read the
books or watched the Swedish versions I recommend now starting with the
US version of the film. This US version will be the first of the
trilogy; The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl who played with
Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest.<br /><br />The opening credit sequence, as I&#x27;m sure many of you have heard is
quite amazing. I loved it and all the work they put into it. It was
very Bond like yet encompassed the dark complexities of this story and
the film. This film is much more speedy than the Swedish versions. I
found the Swedish films to be a little slow at times, which yes builds
tension however the pacing of the US version is much more my speed.
Very fast and smart.<br /><br />It is a murder mystery film, however it is also about the two main
characters and their interactions and working together to solve a
murder, or series of murders. I do not want to give anything away as
the story and how it unfolds is what makes the movie run so well.
Clocking in at 2 hours and 40 minutes, the US version is quite long.
However it is a movie which you rather it not end due to the
entertaining characters and the intense visual situations which you
wish to look away from, but you can&#x27;t.<br /><br />When it comes to the characters, I found that Rooney Mara played a much
better Lisbeth than Noomi Rapace. And the interactions with Mikael
Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) were great and at times quite funny. The two
of them working together when they seem to be opposites was very
entertaining and Daniel and Rooney pulled it off perfectly. As a huge
fan of the new Bond reboots I have grown to love Daniel Craig and enjoy
seeing him on the screen. He is a very talented actor and seems to give
the audience what they want. Stellan Skarsg&#xE5;rd, Christopher Plummer and
Robin Wright also did a great job, as well as the other cast members.
Each character was very carefully cast and bond perfectly to the heart
of this film.<br /><br />The story, the acting, the directing; everything was perfect and I must
say that director David Fincher is at the top of his game. For those
who do not know, he directed Fight Club, Se7en, The Game, Zodiac, The
Social Network, Alien 3, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and Panic
Room. The music, the ambiance, and the over-all dark feel to the film
was so well done I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I could not have asked for a
better-crafted film. I am quite anxious to see the rest of the trilogy.
