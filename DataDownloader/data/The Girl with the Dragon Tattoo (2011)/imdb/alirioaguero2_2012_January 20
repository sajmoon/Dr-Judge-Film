Wow, where to start? First I&#x27;ll say that even if I rate many films as
10/10, this is one of those few whose real rating should be 1000/10.<br /><br />Solely the opening sequence is Oscar-Worthy. Atmosphere is so good,
photography is a masterpiece, everything seams authentic, even more
special mention of sound design and beautiful music score by Trent
Raznor and Atticus Ross. Simply enchanting! <br /><br />I usually like thrillers and mysteries, but this one is even better.
It&#x27;s not only thriller, it&#x27;s also drama and the characterization is
strong and it shakes you all the time along. The plot actually contains
two story lines, Vanger family and Lisbeth Salander, which eventually
clash together, and each is fantastic by itself. Story is intriguing,
it doesn&#x27;t back out one bit from telling the ugly truth and it doesn&#x27;t
even soften it. It says straight in your face everything you need to
know. With no sugar-coding at all.<br /><br />Acting performances are fantastic! Rooney Mara simply IS Lisbeth
Salander, so emotional, autistic, fragile, yet strong, intelligent,
independent young woman, who can easily be a role model to many young
women who have had it rough in life. She literally transforms into the
role, who uncompromisingly takes lemons life gave her and turns them
into lemonade without second thought about it. She truly does deserve
our respect, Lisbeth, and Rooney Mara, a lovely young actress with very
bright future. I know it is unpredictable to say who will win Oscar,
but she has my vote, and I know I&#x27;ll be disappointed if she doesn&#x27;t get
nominated. Her performance is hand to hand with Heath Ledger as the
Joker, and my personal favorite film ever so far is The Dark Knight, so
I know what I&#x27;m saying.<br /><br />Daniel Craig is also amazing as Mikael Blomkvist and quite different
than in Bond movies, proving he is a great actor. Stellan Skarsgard,
Christopher Plummer and Joely Richardson are especially good in this
stellar award-winning cast and if any of them receives Supporting
actor/actress Oscar nomination, it will be very much deserved. All
episodic cast is also superb, notable mention goes to Geraldine James,
Per Myrberg, Alan Dale and Goran Visnjic. Everybody was just...
AMAZING! <br /><br />So, David Fincher&#x27;s film is a masterpiece which will not be forgotten
in movie history! It is shocking, emotional, deep, clever and
realistic, it won&#x27;t leave anyone indifferent. I would give it more that
10/10 if I could and I know I&#x27;ll buy a double DVD when it comes out.<br /><br />Only thing left to say is... I can&#x27;t wait for The Girl Who Played With
Fire to be made and I hope it will be soon. If it is as half as good as
this one, it will still get 10/10 from me.<br /><br />Recommendation to see!!!
