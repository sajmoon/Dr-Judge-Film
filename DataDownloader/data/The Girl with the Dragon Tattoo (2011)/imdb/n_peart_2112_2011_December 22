2011_December 22 
I&#x27;m going to begin by saying that I read the books first, watched the
2009 films afterwards, and I have just come back from seeing Fincher&#x27;s
adaptation for the second time. And Fincher&#x27;s is by far the superior of
the films. I am no stranger to the story and experienced it in the
&#x22;proper order&#x22; as many elitist fans would call it. (While the ever more
elitist &#x22;fans&#x22; would not have even watched Fincher&#x27;s version).
Fincher&#x27;s Direction is superior; Trent Reznor &#x26; Atticus Ross&#x27;s musical
genius sets the perfect tone for the film, and best of all, the cast
lends themselves to a brilliant story in ways that I believe would be
irreproducible by any other actor/actress. I may be blasphemous for
saying this but I don&#x27;t care. Rooney Mara nailed the role better than
Noomi Rapace and I look forward to Fincher&#x27;s future endeavours with
Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist in coming years. And as for you
people who are ever insistent on the same lame-@$$ed arguments to
appear like you know what everyone else &#x22;should&#x22; enjoy...original
languages do not make a movie good. &#x22;Passion of the Christ&#x22; was not
more enriching because it was in Arabic. Not wanting to read subtitles
is not a curse of the Lazy Man and the fact that you do does not mean
you are more intelligent, cultured, or artistic. It means you are
boastful,arrogant, and are looking for something to make you feel
superior instead of going to watch a movie for a good story. If you
want to be 100% pure in your Stieg Larsson enjoyment, learn Swedish,
move to Stockholm, and bask in the glory that is your raging unmerited
self esteem. If a language is reason for you not to enjoy something,
you&#x27;ve missed the point entirely of watching a movie.
