The Swedisch translation of the Stieg Larsson novel couldn&#x27;t be more
perfect in my eyes. The devotion of the actors in playing their role is
excellent.<br /><br />Rooney Mara played an incredible and truthful role as Lisbeth Salander.
It is incredible how devoted she has played this role with a lot of
violence and explicit scenes. Her real piercings and other visual
characteristics, her Swedisch accent and her incredible acting skills
made her a perfect Lisbeth Salander.<br /><br />&#x22;The Immigrant Song&#x22; cover by Trent Reznor and Karen O made a big
impression to me as in the trailer as in the movie itself. It created a
nice atmosphere for the rest of the movie.<br /><br />In the movie, there are a lot of dialogs, but they aren&#x27;t as
complicated as you have in a lot of other movies. Also, the dialogs are
so well written, you never get bored during the entire movie, they are
always followed by an action scene of something exciting that has
happened. You really get into the story so you wont&#x27;t notice the movies
duration of 158 minutes.<br /><br />Also the interaction with the main characters showed Dani&#xEB;l Craig in
one of his better acting roles. The interaction between Lisbeth
Salander and Mikael Blomkvist is that convincing that you want to see a
sequel as soon as the ending scene of this movie has passed.<br /><br />It looks like David Fincher looked a lot at the original movie and
improved all the shortcomings to make this film a perfect translation
of the original story. The interaction between the characters is better
and you feel like there is a lot more that needs to be said and done,
hopefully in the sequel. Therefore I would - at this early time of the
year - say it&#x27;s the movie of the year.<br /><br />I&#x27;m also convinced Rooney Mara will get an Oscar for this performance.
