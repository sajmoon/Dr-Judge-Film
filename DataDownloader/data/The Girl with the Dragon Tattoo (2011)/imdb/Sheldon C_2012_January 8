As a film, THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO succeeds. An an adaptation,
it is frustrating. As a remake, it is pointless. <br /><br />Fincher&#x27;s film does many things very, very well. The characters are
extremely well-cast - Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara both impressively
fit the roles of Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander in both attitude
and physicality, much more so than their Swedish counterparts; the
production design is stunning - the bigger budget pays off as the
settings and atmosphere feel much colder and moodier in the snowy and
eerie town of Hedestad; and the pacing, after things are rapidly
established, flows smoothly with a careful balance of tension,
patience, and story development. The film is a finely-crafted thriller
that is carried by the performances of its two leads, both of whom
showcase great chemistry with one another and admirably so in the
depths of a dark, disturbing, and mysterious world. <br /><br />As a remake a mere two years after the original, however, this film had
to have been beyond great in order to warrant its existence, and quite
frankly, it is not. Every character not only speaks English but does so
each with varying accents, despite being set in Sweden, and although
viewers are expected to suspend their disbelief, it&#x27;s tough to do so
given the inconsistencies in seeing English news channels with Swedish
words, or fully Swedish newspaper articles found through an
English-based Google search. How Fincher could have solved this problem
is an enigma within itself, therefore confirming that this adaptation
was never necessary. Add to that a horrific and awfully out-of-place
opening sequence in addition to an obnoxious and unremarkable score by
Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross and you have a really good film that is
oddly enough a disappointment. <br /><br />For the record, like its Swedish counterpart, TATTOO fails to fully
encompass the scale of Stieg Larsson&#x27;s novel, which is somewhat
forgivable given its various restrictions, but likewise, the brutality
was not brutal enough, the characterizations were not fully realized,
and the impact of it all failed to achieve both a climax that should
have been more powerful and a relief for the characters and the
audience that should have likened a gigantic breath of fresh air. <br /><br />With that said, TATTOO is still nevertheless a very solid film from a
talented and experienced team. Pic is recommended, but depending on
where the viewer is coming from, it will be a widely assorted
experience.
