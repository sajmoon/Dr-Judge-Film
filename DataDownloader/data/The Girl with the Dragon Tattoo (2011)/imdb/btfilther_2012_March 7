2012_March 7 
I regret to admit I fell victim to my previous experience with this
title. Unfortunately when you come to the point of evaluating something
you can not simply discard expectations, attitude, emotional state and
finally comparison. I am a huge fan of Daniel Craig and I was eager to
see his performance, which in my opinion was... decent. Rooney Mara was
OK. Unfortunately &#x22;OK&#x22; is not enough in that case. <br /><br />Everything felt like different parts were stitched together with no
consistency. It lacked fluidity and at some parts there were gaps in
the logic of the story. I don&#x27;t really know who to blame. Is it the
director&#x27;s fault, is it the screenplay or both, but most of the time
the actors were so confused about their roles as if they were waiting
for someone backstage to remind them it is their part now and they
should act and speak. The movie failed at capturing this really dark,
perverted and deranged atmosphere I felt while watching the Swedish
adaptation. This was in parts because of the aforementioned leaps from
one episode to the other and also because of the shallow character
development. I was waiting to be tossed into some deep emotional and
psychological aspects of Lisbeth&#x27;s personality and I am still waiting
long after the end credits but to no avail. Noomi Rapace&#x27;s acting was
so intense it was almost violating. It makes you experience whole
plethora of extreme emotions and crave for more. I felt nothing like
this here, no compassion or rage, no sympathies, empathy or
curiosity...it was if Rooney Mara&#x27;s Lisbeth was just passing by to say
hello. This was no interpretation as many of the comments here claim,
it was a complete rip-off. Exact same scenes, angles, but hollow and
irrelevant. I don&#x27;t find the &#x22;James Bond&#x22; beginning even amusing. <br /><br />Reading some of the reviews most of the people pay credit to David
Fincher, but in my opinion he is the main weakness of the film...
obviously not in terms of the gross income it generated, but in the
interpretation. It was the first thriller murdered by its own director.
He managed to murder the story and the characters quite easy. The halo
effect around him and the cast compensates the total inability to
understand and represent certain social and cultural aspects embodied
in this dark Nordic story. <br /><br />Fincher is most certainly the next Uwe Boll.
