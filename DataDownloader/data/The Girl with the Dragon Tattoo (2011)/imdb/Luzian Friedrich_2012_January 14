Craig is a really fine actor as well as Rooney Mara. And Fincher is
maybe the most interesting director working today. Even though &#x22;The
Social Network&#x22; was not as critically as i wished (regarding the
disadvantages of www), it shows how impressive a David Fincher work can
look.<br /><br />I&#x27;ve although seen the Swedish version, but noomi racpace was a little
to old and to muscular for this part. Not that it was bad, but Mara
fits so much more in this Lisbeth-Salander-thing that it is obviously
who makes the better interpretation.<br /><br />I hope that SONY will stand by what the say and convince Fincher to end
his &#x22;own&#x22; Trilogy just like Nolan with his Batman thing.<br /><br />I really enjoyed and recommend the movie to everybody who&#x27;s interested
in adult, thrilling and feel-bad movies of cause! 9 or maybe 9.5/10 for
one of the best entertaining movies in the last 12 months
