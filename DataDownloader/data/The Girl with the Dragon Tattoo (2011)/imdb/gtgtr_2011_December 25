The Swedish version was much more well-written, orchestrated, and
directed. There was a sense of suspense, emotion, and realism to the
movie that the Fincher version simply lacks. Lisbeth&#x27;s past is seldom
explored, and when it is, it&#x27;s poorly placed in the movie. The
emotional connection between Mikael and Lisbeth is &#x27;forced&#x27; at best,
and quite awkward at certain moments. There are so many interesting
facets about Lisbeth&#x27;s personality and character that could&#x27;ve been
explored a lot better, and you simply don&#x27;t leave the theatre with the
same sense of &#x27;wow&#x27; that defined the Swedish version. The more positive
thing about Fincher&#x27;s version though, is Rooney Mara, who played
Salander nicely.
