Well most of you probably read the book (or the trilogy even). It was
and still is a bestseller, something that starts and ends a
conversation over a short coffee break. An easy read, thrilling story
and a Swedish touch, who could resist? David Fincher certainly
couldn&#x27;t. Thank you David Fincher for taking the matter seriously, as
always.<br /><br />The story follows the book better than the Swedish original, the
characters are portrayed in a more thorough way, systematically so to
say. This is a good thing of course and if you put Hollywood money
aside, the biggest difference between the Swedish interpretation and
the Fincher vision. The visuals are superb, the winter of Swedish north
was revealed in such a way that even I felt the coldness (in my cozy
little apartment) and the chill in my not so old bones.<br /><br />My rating is a strong eight, I could be nine but I am still struggling
with the casting choice for the Lisbeth Salander. I still believe the
Noomi Rapace would be better, but you know what, if the Oscar goes to
Rooney Mara, you will know that I am wrong (wouldn&#x27;t be the first
time). Anyway, a strong recommendation follows: watch this movie.
