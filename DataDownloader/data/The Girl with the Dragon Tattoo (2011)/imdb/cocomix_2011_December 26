I just saw the movie yesterday. I was hoping not to be disappointed
after seeing all of the posters &#x26; teasers &#x26; trailers...and I wasn&#x27;t.
Having read all three books, my first glimpse of Rooney Mara as
Salander led me to think &#x22;OH! She looks just like I imagined her too
look!!!&#x22; It&#x27;s like she jumped off of the pages of the book! Thank you
David Fincher and everyone else involved for painting this movie so
brilliantly and for casting it the way you did. INCREDIBLE! Daniel
Craig, too is a perfect Blomquist (far more attractive than I imagined
him to be! Thanks! Bonus+++). Whatever creative karma you all (people
making the sequel) have going on PLEASE keep it up for the next 2
movies. I think it&#x27;s a great film and a great story and a great tribute
to a writer that died way too soon. BRAVO!!!!!!!!!!
