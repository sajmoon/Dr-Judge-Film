2012_January 28 
Let me just start by saying that I have both read the book and seen all
three of the Swedish films, so going into the theater I knew what to
expect. And I have only positive things to say. Sure, a lot of the
scenes in this version resemble those in the Swedish one, but that was
to be expected, wasn&#x27;t it? I mean, both films are adapted from the same
novel!<br /><br />About the film itself: As you might expect from an American remake with
David Fincher behind the wheel the film is a lot more action packed and
goes through events a little faster than the Swedish version. The cast
is superb and very well picked, and the atmosphere throughout is very
dense and isolated. As the story slowly unravels it becomes more and
more gruesome and mysterious, and it grabs you and doesn&#x27;t let go for
the next hour and a half. Then what seems like the showdown arrives,
but the real answer to the great mystery is even more surprising than
you think, and it&#x27;s something you couldn&#x27;t have possibly thought of,
but which, when you think about it later (as I&#x27;m doing now) is pretty
much the only logical one. As the final scenes, which make the
connection with the second book, play out you can&#x27;t help but feel sad
that it had to end so soon. <br /><br />SUMMARY FOR THOSE WHO DON&#x27;T FEEL LIKE READING THE ABOVE: This film is
definitely better than the Swedish version, and its mystery has a way
of gripping you and not letting you go until the end. You should see
it.
