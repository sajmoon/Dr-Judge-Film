On balance, preferred to the original (film). It&#x27;s idiomatically more
like a typical American studio thriller and beautifully designed.
Daniel Craig is perfectly suited for the imperfect Mikael, tempering
his performance with a perpetual air of self-doubt or genuine
fallibility. Rooney Mara could hardly be bettered as the gauche,
damaged genius of the title. The largely British casting of the Vanger
family is an investment with guaranteed return (Joely Richardson
particularly fine in her brief appearances). Trent Reznor&#x27;s score is
effective if modest.<br /><br />Some issues: where does that title sequence come from or point to? I
don&#x27;t mind a flight of fancy but it strikes me as out of character for
such a liberty in an otherwise economical narrative. Which brings me on
to the third and fourth issues - I had little idea what was going on
much of the time, not that it mattered; but the extended epilogue as
the reason for Blomkvist&#x27;s fall from grace is chased about Europe was
an unnecessary codicil to the tale. It&#x27;s a long film.<br /><br />Still, there are some great sequences - the subplot concerning
Lisbeth&#x27;s social administrator is punchy and grim but gripping. 7/10
