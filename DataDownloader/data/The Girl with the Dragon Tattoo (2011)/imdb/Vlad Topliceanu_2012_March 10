What an awesome film! I can&#x27;t think of anything else to start with when
I tell a person about this film. What an awesome film! The Girl with
the Dragon Tattoo is a thriller film directed by Academy Award nominee
David Fincher and written by Academy Award winner Steven Zaillian.<br /><br />The thing I loved most about this film was the pacing. In this 2 and a
half hour long film, you never get bored. Not one single time! I really
admire when a film makes me stay with it 100%. I remember There Will Be
Blood doing that to me in a similar way. Rooney Mara was stunning in
her performance as Lisbeth Salander. Daniel Craig didn&#x27;t give his best
performance ever, but he was OK, and the chemistry he had with Mara was
very good. In terms of acting, Christopher Plummer was amazing as
Henrik Vanger and I hope he will never retire from acting, although he
is already 82 years old. The original score of the film was great and I
am surprised it did not get nominated for an Academy Award. David
Fincher also did a nice job. Not as good as in other films like The
Curious Case of Benjamin Button or The Social Network, but still,
satisfactory work and in concordance with the rest of the film.<br /><br />The movie was so good, that I was expecting something spectacular from
the ending. Well, I didn&#x27;t get that. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I thought it
was a smart and logical ending, I simply didn&#x27;t like it. Maybe it&#x27;s
because I didn&#x27;t want the movie to end at all.<br /><br />All in all this is a great film with great acting, great music and I
could go on. Almost everything in it is great and I sincerely do not
know why I am not giving this a 10.
