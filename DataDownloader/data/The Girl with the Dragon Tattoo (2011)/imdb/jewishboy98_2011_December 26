Having never read the book I went to see The Girl With The Dragon
Tattoo without any preconceived ideas about the characters or how the
story unfolds. I therefore realise that this film may not live up to
expectations of the book fans but in terms of a piece of cinema this is
definitely as good as Fincher&#x27;s previous work. <br /><br />For those who have not read the book, the story portrays disgraced
journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) who is asked by ageing
patriarch Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to investigate the murder
of his favourite niece, Harriet. The titular character, Lisbeth
Salander, (Rooney Mara) is originally hired to do a background check on
Blomkvist but is eventually drawn into his intricate and dark
investigation. <br /><br />As usual Fincher makes, what he can, fast-paced and thrilling but does
find time for the heartfelt among the cut-throat action. Although the
film is quite long it does not feel at all dragged out and overly long. <br /><br />Mara is absolutely fantastic as Lisbeth Salander and gives a delicate
and vulnerable aspect to the otherwise hardened and vicious girl.
Daniel Craig shows off his already established talent as Mikael and
Plummer, with his limited screen time, takes centre stage and steals
the spot light from his colleagues. The rest of the cast do well but
most of the plaudits deserve to go to Mara. <br /><br />If you can stomach this fast-paced, gritty, dark and disturbing tale I
urge you to go and see it not only because of Fincher&#x27;s fantastic
direction or Mara show-stopping performance but for the riveting and
irregular ride you are in for.
