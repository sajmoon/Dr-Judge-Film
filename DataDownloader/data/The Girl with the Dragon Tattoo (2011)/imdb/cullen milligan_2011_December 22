I guess there&#x27;s no need to beat around the bush. I&#x27;ll go ahead and say
that Rooney Mara deserves the Academy Award for best actress due to her
powerful, yet disturbing role as Lisbeth Salander in this film. Now,
with that being said, this movie is why I go to the theater. The
setting was perfect, the acting was amazing, the writing was superb,
and in my honest opinion, the film clearly separates itself from the
Swedish version that many (including myself) saw and loved. It&#x27;s an
American telling of a Swedish novel and everybody dialed it up big time
for this movie. Now this is not a movie that I would take a child to go
see and I would be skeptical of taking friends to see it around the
holidays due to the disturbing content, but it is still beyond amazing.
This movie forces you to pay close attention to every little detail
when it comes to solving a mystery and the ending is not one you would
expect if you had never read the novel. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
shows you the darkest side of people (especially men and I can&#x27;t go
into that without telling you about the film.) I can&#x27;t say enough about
Rooney Mara who transforms herself for this role. For those of you who
are dead-set on bashing this film because you love Noomi Rapace as
Lisbeth, if you let that go for a little while, you will see like I do,
a film that is deserving of every single award it WILL win and
consideration as one of the best films of the last 20 years.
