I have not seen the Swedish film so cannot tell you what this does by
contrast. No, I came to this after feeling spent from some recent heavy
duty viewing and looking to unwind with slick pop darkness and
gratuitous mystery: looking for a detective film where the detective
did all the work for us and we just sat back and appreciated the
mechanics. A film very much like Seven then, with its own type of
abrasiveness.<br /><br />This is Fincher&#x27;s job in Hollywood, to be our current Billy Wilder. A
perfectly efficient working hand who can subordinate himself to what a
story demands so long as he gets a few spots to exercise his game. <br /><br />Superficially the thing is written around three girls, each one coveted
in some way and in turn some part missing.<br /><br />One is the young heiress of the company and beloved sister long
presumed dead and the trigger for our movie: we visit the place, a
remote island with suspects arranged like pawns on a board game, and
begin to unpack a narrative that happened long ago and is thought to
reveal shady foundations of an entire Swedish society. Bits and pieces
from photos are animated like films that we swoop in to follow; but
disjointed or parts of a whole? And true as we see or misleading
testimonies?<br /><br />Another girl is the daughter, preppy beautiful and smart but apparently
very religious. This is meant to baffle a little, as though something
may be wrong with her. Daddy issues, we presume. But she gives us the
one half of a clue that eventually clicks everything together; Bible
quotes.<br /><br />The other half of the clue - Jewish names, so possible Nazi involvement
- we get from what is by now the most widely advertised aspect of the
film. Another investigator but this time young, eccentric, visibly
tormented but a sharp mind. Pierced through with pain from, you guessed
it, daddy issues. Of course our man feeling guilty for not spending
time with his daughter, he makes it up to this girl her age. We&#x27;re
meant to understand that she is very much the product of that first
violence we are investigating, and having to grapple with gross but
official injustice that still goes unpunished to this day. <br /><br />So this is the thing that wraps the whole; each of these girls as a
mirror to the others and all of them together a mirror of an abusive
society. Simple but sold well. Designer hurt for the girl as a
grownup&#x27;s idea of what would appeal to a young demographic and on the
other end contemporary political implications tied up with the one
thing the Scandinavians have reason to be ashamed of - Nazi ties - to
appeal to the parents. The writer has written himself in the thing as
reflecting his own investigations in right-wing groups.<br /><br />Now Fincher&#x27;s game is usually a psychological dislocation diffused into
the architecture; Pitt&#x27;s house by the railroad tracks in Seven, the
Narrator&#x27;s house in Fight Club, the entire house with a hidden room and
cameras everywhere in The Panic Room. Usually he weaves some dark
fiction around this, gratuitous, eye-popping stuff, but he&#x27;s at his
most adept when evaluating human interiors in spatial terms.<br /><br />I presumed here that a lot of power would be derived by the bridge
setting, initially introduced as the main setting of a film-within. The
complex of grey two-story homes. The main set-piece takes place in one,
starting up and going down in the basement, but it&#x27;s not a patch on the
famous scene from Zodiac and is tritely resolved with a chase and a
fireball. Nothing interesting to see, as it turns out. Maybe because
Fincher is just a better filmmaker than the original writer is a
writer.
