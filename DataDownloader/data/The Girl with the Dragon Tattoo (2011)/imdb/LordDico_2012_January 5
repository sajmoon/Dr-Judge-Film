There have been many films this year that have caught interest in many.
With the film &#x27;The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo&#x27;, directed by Fight Club
director, David Fincher, many fans of the book that the film&#x27;s based on
were cautious, since there has been a Swedish film that was faithful to
the fist book of three. I, myself, was as cautious as them, only it was
due to Fincher&#x27;s last film, &#x27;The Social Network&#x27;. Many had been pleased
with the film about Facebook creator, Mark Zuckerberg, mostly due to
being users of the site. Even though I&#x27;ve used the site as well, I
can&#x27;t help but feel that the film had lacked much character into this
and that Eisenberg, who portrayed Zuckerberg in the film, gave a
performance of a golden toaster; might look impressive, but there&#x27;s not
much to it. Now with David Fincher&#x27;s newest film, what can be said
about it. Well, it can easily be past as a much better film than Social
Network will be to me.<br /><br />With what the story goes, Daniel Craig plays Mikael Blomkvist, co-owner
and author for Millennium Magazine, and is now being hired to solve the
case of the disappearance of the great niece of Henrik Vanger, played
by Christopher Plummer. While finding some clues, he then calls upon
Lisbeth Salander, played by Rooney Mara, to help him out, all while
developing a strong relationship together. For being one of my most
anticipated movies of the year, I had high hopes thinking it would be
one of the best films I&#x27;ve seen this year, with all the hype it&#x27;s been
getting. But alas, it&#x27;s not as much as they say it to be. Granted, it
wasn&#x27;t anywhere CLOSE to bad, but it was still kinda underwhelming.
Though, I still would watch this more times and find it more developed
than &#x27;The Social Network&#x27;, even if &#x27;Dragon Tattoo&#x27; is two hours and
forty minutes long. The performances delivered by each of the actors
was well done and didn&#x27;t in the slightest bore me, with much suspense
given to the story, and not once using jumps to scare the everliving
pants off us. It takes it&#x27;s time with it, bringing up to the strong
ending that the characters will have to deal with. Even though I never
read the book, nor did I watch the Swedish versions, I found it to
still be a good film at the least.<br /><br />Overall, &#x27;Girl With the Dragon Tattoo&#x27; is an exciting thriller with
excellent acting from a great cast of people, and with some scenes,
you&#x27;d know why they would give this film an &#x27;R&#x27; rating. It&#x27;s not done
so much, to what most comedies today want to do, but in the essence of
making an exciting thriller.
