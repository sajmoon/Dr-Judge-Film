Haunting and brutal. Captivating yet, profoundly disturbing and
troubling. I had no doubt the movie I waited all year for would be the
best. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo **** (Out of ****)<br /><br />I&#x27;m troubled. Troubled in the sense of getting over what I just saw.
What I just witnessed was the latest work of David Fincher (one of my
favorite directors of all time, I might add, who has also directed two
movies on my top ten of all time), The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. The
film itself follows journalist Mikael Blomkvist (played by Daniel
Craig) who investigates a disappearance of a wealthy ancestor&#x27;s niece
over forty years ago. Blomkvist is later assisted by a computer hacker
named Lisbeth Salander (who is played nothing short of perfect by
Rooney Mara). The dynamic duo work together in the investigation,
uncovering something beyond anything else. Now to understand how
different the two are: Craig&#x27;s character is a disgraced journalist, has
a life, job and a girl. He&#x27;s doing alright. Now Mara&#x27;s character is a
pierced, tattooed punk who commonly hacks into people&#x27;s computers, ward
of state and commonly wears a ripped shirt that says &#x22;f*** you, you
f*****g f***.&#x22; I like the shirt.<br /><br />Now, Ronney Mara&#x27;s character makes the movie. In fact, it might just be
her movie. She out does Noomi Rapace, who played Lisbeth Salander in
the Swedish version of the film (which is nothing short of brilliant
either). I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if her punkish attitude ended her up
with a Best Actress Oscar.<br /><br />What drives the film? What drives the film is not only the haunting
feel and its chilling and brutal content, but I have to give kudos to
Mr. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for the score. The score itself is so
haunting, it sets the tone for the 158 minute film perfectly. Best
Original Score, anyone?<br /><br />Sir David Fincher, you have done it again. You made a favorite of the
year for the second year in a row. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
might just be 2011&#x27;s best. No question, it&#x27;s definitely the most
troubling, but it&#x27;s also the best.
