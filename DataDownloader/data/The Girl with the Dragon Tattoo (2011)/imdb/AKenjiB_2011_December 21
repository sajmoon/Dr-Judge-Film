First off, for the thousandth time, this is NOT a remake of the Swedish
film. It&#x27;s an adaptation of the book. This is evident by the fact that
several things in the book were kept in this movie but not in the
Swedish adaptation.<br /><br />Secondly, this is NOT a Hollywood phone it in cash grabber. This is a
thriller made to near perfection.<br /><br />I&#x27;m a big fan of the Swedish version. I thought that Noomi Rapace did
an incredible job and the story was interesting and fun to watch but it
wasn&#x27;t without it&#x27;s flaws.<br /><br />The American version is simply better in my opinion. Daniel Craig did a
far better job as Mikael Blomvkist and Rooney Mara gave a tour de force
performance as Lisbeth. I actually thought that she did better than
Noomi Rapace.<br /><br />We also have some really strong supporting performances including
Henrik Vanger who hires Mikael Blomvkist (Daniel Craig) to investigate
the disappearance and presumed death of his great niece. Stellan
Skarsg&#xE5;rd plays Martin Vanger, the brother of the missing girl and is
also very strong.<br /><br />The film starts off a bit slow but it&#x27;s not boring and it only becomes
more and more exciting as it goes on. Even though I had already seen
the Swedish film, Fincher creates such a great atmosphere that I still
felt my heart racing.<br /><br />The score by Trent Reznor (who won an Oscar last year for The Social
Network) is also beautiful. It&#x27;s subtle and perfectly sets the tone for
the story.<br /><br />This film also succeeds where the Swedish version faulted. The Swedish
version felt unnecessarily convoluted at times while the American
version, while complex, never felt confusing. Also, the final half hour
of the Swedish version felt dull and draggy while the American version
kept my interest. The American version also has a much better ending.
If you&#x27;re a fan of the book, be sure to check it out. If you&#x27;re a fan
of the Swedish film, be sure to check it out. If this is your first
time meeting Lisbeth and Mikael, then definitely check it out. This is
classic Fincher. Dark, stylish, and brilliant. One of the best films of
the year. Easily in my top 5.
