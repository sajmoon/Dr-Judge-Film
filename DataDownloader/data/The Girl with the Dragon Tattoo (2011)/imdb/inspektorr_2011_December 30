Two years after seeing the original Swedish films, I couldn&#x27;t wait for
the Girl with the dragon tattoo to hit the theaters. Ever since that
incredible first trailer burned into my retinas, I had a feeling this
remake wouldn&#x27;t fail. And not only it didn&#x27;t fail, it delivered with
style, grit and dark edginess I was hoping for. The cast is pretty much
spot on. Daniel Craig, with a few extra pounds, gives an impressive and
convincing role of a journalist Mikael Blomkvist. Compared to Michael
Nyquist from the original trilogy, which performance I enjoyed very
much, Craig is definitively up to the task.<br /><br />Of course, all eyes are on Rooney Mara playing Lisbeth Salander - an
incredibly complex, solitary and traumatized hacker, who is hired to
help Blomkvist solve a 40 year old mystery. Mara is simply amazing in
portraying Lisbeth, both visually and emotionally, it&#x27;s such a
believable performance that after a while you simply cannot imagine her
not being Lisbeth in real life.<br /><br />Cinematically, Fincher leads the movie with strings of superbly done
shots, great dialogs and occasional shocker scenes that will get the
hair on your neck stand up. While the run-time of 2 and a half hours
may seem long, the time simply flies by and you end up wanting the
movie to never end.<br /><br />I only have two small complaints: first is casting Sarsgard as Martin
Vanger. While I love Skarsgard and have seen many of his movies, for
someone who&#x27;s even slightly familiar with his work, there will be no
doubt about what happens at the end. Second is about Lisbeth Salander
character. While I can not praise Mara&#x27;s performance enough, I have to
say that Noomi Rapace in the original movie was more &#x22;manly&#x22;. I know
that it may not make much sense, but little details in walking,
expressions and gestures made Rapace even more detached from any
feminine characteristic. Rapace&#x27;s performance made me feel that Lisbeth
was so troubled and traumatized that she had lost almost any feeling of
connection to humanity. For example, I loved the fact that Noomi in
original movie had unshaven armpits. It was such a small detail, but it
instantly made you realize just how messed up her life is. While Mara
is astonishing as Lisbeth, there&#x27;s no mistake that she&#x27;s a woman -
albeit damaged, but still feminine enough.<br /><br />Many have mentioned violence and some other &#x22;tough to swallow&#x22; scenes.
Honestly, they will make you feel really uncomfortable, but that&#x27;s the
point. They are not gore, they&#x27;re not glorified and are certainly there
for a good reason. Ommiting them would be a big mistake.<br /><br />One more thing - the intro scene is pure audio-visual orgasm. I can
hardly think of anything I enjoyed watching more on big screen then
those first few minutes.<br /><br />Overall - 10/10. And watch the originals as well.
