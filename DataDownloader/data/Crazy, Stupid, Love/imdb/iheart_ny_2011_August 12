Let me start off my review of this film by saying that I hate Steve
Carrell. Watching him on &#x22;The Office&#x22; for all those years was painful,
because his character, and it seemed his acting style was unbelievably
stupid and bland. While he has occasionally been a decent funnyman, I
hadn&#x27;t seen him in a role where he was remotely interesting and
believable.<br /><br />Yesterday, I was at the movies, pretty much the whole day, and decided
to check out &#x22;Crazy Stupid Love&#x22;, because it had decent critical and
audience reactions, better than I expected for a romantic comedy, and
it had some of my favorite people in it, including Julianne Moore, Emma
Stone and Ryan Gosling. And, to say the least, I was caught by
surprise.<br /><br />One of the reasons for this, is because &#x22;Crazy Stupid Love&#x22; works as a
romantic comedy and a drama. Most romantic comedies, I find, are
predictable, stale, and essentially one carbon copy after another, of
the same exact story, played out in a slightly altered way. You
probably won&#x27;t guess where &#x22;Crazy Stupid Love&#x22; is going. While the
ending itself is a lot like I predicted it, there&#x27;s a big plot twist
that presents itself in the climax that I really didn&#x27;t see coming. And
that&#x27;s reason enough to see this movie.<br /><br />However, there are many (better) reasons. One of the big reasons is
that it avoids making any of its characters caricatures. Each character
is real, and flawed, screwed up and deals with his or her problems in a
very grounded and grown-up way. <br /><br />It revolves around Cal (Carell), a man who has been married to Emily
(Moore) for 25 years, and is rocked by the revelation that she wants a
divorce, after sleeping with a co-worker (Kevin Bacon). Cal begins
hanging out at a chic pickup bar, where he meets Jacob (Ryan Gosling),
a lothario who takes a different woman home every night. He picks up on
Cal&#x27;s depression, and helps him turn into something of a womanizer.
Meanwhile, Cal&#x27;s floppy-haired thirteen-year-old son Robbie has a crush
on his older babysitter, who has a little crush of her own. Also, Jacob
meets Hannah (Emma Stone), a young lawyer who has heard every pickup
line, and therefore, has a quite jaded outlook on love.<br /><br />And it is the first film or TV show to portray Steve Carrell as a human
being. He can act! Who knew? I actually liked him in this role, because
I felt that he wasn&#x27;t Michael Scott, or that guy from &#x22;Get Smart&#x22;, or
&#x22;The 40-Year-Old Virgin&#x22;, but an average guy whose life didn&#x27;t turn out
as he had hoped. I bought him in this role. He more than keeps up with
the rest of the film&#x27;s stellar cast.<br /><br />Another revelation here is Ryan Gosling. I&#x27;ve mostly seen him in
depressing dramatic roles (&#x22;Blue Valentine&#x22;, &#x22;The Notebook&#x22;), while
here, he proves himself to be a cunning comedian. He has spectacular
comedic timing, and clearly has a lot of fun here with the other
actors. He seems to be the superficial funnyman at first, and, like the
rest of the cast in this terrific film, opens up, and surprises the
audience.<br /><br />While Julianne Moore is always great, her character and Carrell&#x27;s
character mesh in a way that makes you believe that their marriage
lasted 20+ years. Emma Stone is on fire right now, doing a great role
in &#x22;The Help&#x22;, she shines just as much here, if not more. Her character
is instantly lovable, and I can&#x27;t wait to see what she does next. <br /><br />This film also features Marisa Tomei, who gives a fierce, and very
funny performance as a recovering alcoholic schoolteacher who dates Cal
for awhile after his divorce. Kevin Bacon also made me laugh, as
Emily&#x27;s co- worker, who was her post-divorce rebound. While these two
have brief roles, they are very funny and make the most of what they
are given.<br /><br />What makes this film memorable for me, is that it is realistic. It
doesn&#x27;t paint love out to be this magical thing that will automatically
make anyone happy. It knows that love doesn&#x27;t always work out, and
occasionally ends in heartbreak and/or violence. And while it&#x27;s
somewhat a cautionary tale, it ends hopefully and overall, kind of
happily. It made me cry a little, and it made me laugh a lot. And while
it could have been a bit longer, and given its characters some more
room to grow, it was a satisfying overall package that I would
recommend to someone who&#x27;s trying to escape the summer of superhero
flicks and sequels.
