I went to see this movie only because Steve Carell was in this and he
is always good, given the right material. Given that this is a romantic
comedy, I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything new considering it&#x27;s the same story
over and over again. The movie had a good story and the first half was
fun and entertaining, but into the second hour, the movie lost me
because like all comedies, eventually the fun draws to a close and it
just becomes ridiculous. A lot of this movie is implausible and would
never happen in real life and there are way to many stories going on
which makes the script more convoluted than it needs to be. Julianne
Moore and Kevin Bacon are bored as heck on screen with barely anything
to do except to spike the movie&#x27;s budget up for a few known faces in
the industry. This movie also has way too many twists ad turns to knock
you on your ass and bewilder you. With a cast as stellar as this and
two directors, you would think it would be more unique and to the
point, but this becomes a mess and fast. I was really looking forward
to this and wanted like it, but as a whole package, it just gets soggy
after a while. This is a rental at best and to avoid all the horny
teens looking to see Gosling shirtless and Emma Stone in bed just avoid
the theatre.
