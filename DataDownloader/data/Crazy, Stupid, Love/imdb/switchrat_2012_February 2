I watched this movie on the back of viewing Drive (also starring Ryan
Gosling) and was not expecting anything particularly groundbreaking.
I&#x27;m a big fan of Steve Carell and greatly enjoyed Easy A mainly due to
Emma Stone&#x27;s performance so the film did offer some possibilities for
me. I watched it half-grudgingly, as I usually try to avoid any form of
romantic comedy due to their usual formulaic nature.<br /><br />However, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, which didn&#x27;t follow
the usual formula of crass romantic comedies of the past few years. It
made great use of its actors comedic skills, and predictably Carell
comes off the best. However, Stone gets some great lines and delivers
them like a seasoned pro. Gosling even manages some great subtle
reactions, full of suave raised eyebrows and casual charm. I even
managed to not hate Julianne Moore&#x27;s bizarre facial expressions as much
as I usually do.<br /><br />I wonder if it would be possible to turn out a decent a film with just
this cast and nothing else, even the lesser known actors do an
incredible job and in the case of the kids and teenagers, often show up
the adults. The bar scenes between Gosling and Carell are the best in
the movie, but the climax at the school graduation and the showdown in
the garden are so incredibly well written its hard not to be impressed
no matter what your taste is.<br /><br />As far as I could ascertain, everyone is either related or in love with
each other, but the complex relationship web is easy to understand and
you really begin to root for the struggling lovers and even the not-so-
struggling in the case of Gosling. Carell manages to dispense of the
Will Ferrell-inspired random shouting for genuine awkward hilarity
which shows he only continues to grow as a comedian. The young cast
also turn out impressive performances and Marisa Tomei&#x27;s role is not
only perfectly cast but magnificently played.<br /><br />For anyone who has felt the sting or unrequited love, or the problems
that can arise from a stale marriage or a relationship that seems dead,
you&#x27;ll find an extremely accurate portrayal in one of these plot
threads. They really do speak from experience and the ways in which the
characters come full circle and tie together so beautifully at the end
of the film is inspired.<br /><br />The story is nothing magical or particularly inspiring, but it has a
great pace and is effortlessly told. My only issue with the film from a
business standpoint is the title, it will turn off a lot of guys won&#x27;t
want to watch it because it sounds like another standard chick film. It
shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise of a good film, but it is. I watched it as an
agreement with my girlfriend and it turned out to be win win, my advice
is not to be put off by the sugary title and ridiculous cover shot and
watch it, as there really is a different movie underneath the
saccharine that is so easy to enjoy.
