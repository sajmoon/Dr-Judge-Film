The other like part of yourself. Shadows of past and a fragile present.
Fear, emotions and long expectation. And the pain like moral mirror.<br /><br />A meditation-film. Blood-sick and an ambiguous form of love. Questions,
illusions, slices of hate and way of survive. A strange passing and
subtle exploration of relation between brothers.<br /><br />Depressing images and circles of freedom. Nooks of gestures and aspects
of reality like symbols of fiction. Compasion like only instrument to
define the rules of strange and cold universes. And colors of
sentiments essence.<br /><br />The end of film marks the last words of a subtle poem. The shadow of
ataraxia after a long trip, taste of peace after a terrible fight,
touch of new images and possibilities after a powerful interior
tempest.
