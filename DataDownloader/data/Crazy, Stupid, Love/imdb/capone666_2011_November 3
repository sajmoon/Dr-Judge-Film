Crazy, Stupid, Love<br /><br />The key to having a marriage built on trust, respect and love is to tie
the knot on your deathbed.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the couple in this dramedy decided to get married right
out of high school.<br /><br />Subsequent to an affair with her colleague (Kevin Bacon), Emily
(Julianne Moore) decides to end her marriage to her high school
sweetheart Cal (Steve Carell).<br /><br />Forced from his home, Cal returns to the dating scene where he meets a
hip, young, playboy, Jacob (Ryan Gosling), who shows him the ropes.<br /><br />But when Hannah (Emma Stone), a feisty fawn he failed to conquer,
re-enters his life, Jacob begins contemplating settling down.<br /><br />All the while Carl and Emily&#x27;s children learn their own lessons about
love.<br /><br />A sharp, funny, timely romantic-comedy, Crazy, Stupid, Love cunningly
weaves an unexpected and unconventional love story.<br /><br />Despite the film&#x27;s optimistic message, however, crazy, stupid, people
should still not be allowed to procreate. (Green Light)
