This film is a little offbeat as comedies go. It starts on a somber
tone and then tries to build something humorous as it meanders along.
There are some places where the pace slows to a slow walk and it can
almost lose it&#x27;s interest for fans of the faster pace of a lot of
modern film. But I found that I liked that quirkiness and it added some
depth that may have otherwise been lacking in the typical comedy.
However, I feel it may be too much of a pendulum for some as it swings
from serious to comedic. I&#x27;ve noticed that a lot of time, people
looking for a comedy can do without the seriousness. But given those
mood swings, the directors do manage to make it a comedy, after all.<br /><br />When it comes to comedy the cast here is very entertaining. The central
characters are Steve Carell as Cal and Julianne Moore as his
dissatisfied wife Emily. She announces that she wants a divorce after a
tumble in bed with Kevin Bacon as her boss David. Bacon&#x27;s character
clearly has a solid thing for Moore&#x27;s character and commences to pursue
her, but this angle is just a diversion. The film makers missed chances
for funny things that might have supplanted the more serious ones by
neglecting to capitalize on this pairing more.<br /><br />A good deal of the movie revolves around a friendship that builds
between Carell&#x27;s character and Ryan Gosling as the smarmy, girl-crazy
Jacob. That term is often followed by the descriptor &#x22;hound&#x22;. After
meeting in a bar, Gosling takes on Carell to fashion him over into his
own image. That&#x27;s when the more fun aspects of the film start as we
watch Carell try to crawl out of his shy, suburbanite shell to become
more appealing to the opposite sex.<br /><br />One encounter Carell makes is with the stunningly talented Marisa Tomei
as Kate; a school teacher. When she&#x27;s on screen she&#x27;s a huge lot of fun
to watch. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen her give as much as a mediocre
performance and she won&#x27;t disappoint here.<br /><br />Another pairing that may surprise some people, but not me, are the
encounters between Gosling&#x27;s character and Emma Stone playing Hannah.
Gosling has turned into one of moviedom&#x27;s more superior actors; who can
be expected to always deliver a stellar performance. But the real treat
here is Stone. She has become a superb comedienne with a timing and
delivery that is as close to perfect as you can get. In fact, Gosling
is really playing a straight man here to Stone, ala Abbott and
Costello; it&#x27;s that good.<br /><br />But the one who really illuminates the screen is Emma Stone. Each time
I see Stone in a film she is better than the last time and she is
nothing less than enchanting. She always comes across as smart and
funny. I am especially drawn to the smartness. It is amazingly
refreshing to see a female character who actually has brains, beauty
and a lot of good old fashioned humor. It&#x27;s not that &#x22;brainy&#x22; parts
aren&#x27;t written for other actresses; it&#x27;s just that the others almost
never quite pull it off (with a few notable exceptions such as Gwyneth
Paltrow in Proof, but that was decidedly unfunny). Emma Stone is a real
treat to watch and I find I can&#x27;t take my eyes off of her every time
that she&#x27;s on screen. Her very large, luminous eyes run a thousand
expressions a second over an even more expressive face, all of them
unerringly faithful to the character while, at the same time, feeling
very fresh and original. To top it off, she&#x27;s a stunning beauty herself
in that slightly unusual way that normally makes girls off of the
street into supermodels. Stone and Gosling are so good, so
entertaining, that I could effortlessly watch an entire film, perhaps
several entire films, of just them bouncing one-liners and smoking
sexuality off of each other. I found myself actually disappointed when
the spotlight left them.<br /><br />But the film doesn&#x27;t end with just those fine actors, either. There are
some surprising, disarming skirmishes between Jonah Bobo as Carell&#x27;s
thirteen-year-old son Robbie Weaver and Analeigh Tipton as his
seventeen-year-old babysitter Jessica who, herself, has a thing for
Carell. Young Bobo gives a surprisingly good performance as a
love-and-thunder-struck young man struggling with some very real,
grownup emotions. The height disparity between them made it more
enjoyable as we watched and even rooted for Bobo to succeed. I also
enjoyed Tipton (could lips be any more sensual), who&#x27;s face I last saw
as a model; but she&#x27;s a model who can apparently act. She had a hard
part to play, straddling a fine line between funny and what could have
easily been seen as tragic or even perverse. I hope she feels good
about the job she did here and I hope to see more of her in the future.<br /><br />Finally, the very fine actor John Carroll Lynch as Tipton&#x27;s father
Bernie did a fine job with a small part and certainly injected comedy
when he was given the chance.<br /><br />The rest of the film was expertly staged and photographed so it&#x27;s top
quality there. I also enjoyed the musical score, skillfully blending
old favorites into the story in a way more noticeable than usual.<br /><br />All-in-all, Crazy, Stupid, Love teeters on the brink of sappiness
without quite going too far that way and does a good job of appealing
to the usual sentimental themes of love stories throughout the ages
with some unexpected, modern twists. If you&#x27;ve ever been in love, see
it. If you ever want to be in love, see it. Or, if you just like love
stories, see it. It makes for a very good night at the movies. Thank
you one and all.<br /><br />By Bruce L. Jones http://webpages.charter.net/bruce.jones1/
