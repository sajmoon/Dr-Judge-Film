If you don&#x27;t mind the use of cutesy coincidences to drive a plot, this
entertaining film just might charm your socks off. True to its title,
this movie examines the various crazy, stupid, and downright
inexplicable aspects of love&#x97;and the love in this film flows freely:
love lost between an endearing shlub (Steve Carrell) and his wife of 25
years (the always amazing Julianne Moore); love-as-lust as practiced by
a hot young lothario (Ryan Gosling, perfectly cast); love avoided by an
idealistic young lawyer-to-be (Emma Stone, in another role as the
thinking man&#x27;s hot chick); and unrequited love as only teenagers can
experience it (Carrell&#x27;s 13 year-old son, who just knows that his 17
year-old babysitter is his &#x22;soulmate&#x22; and said babysitter, who has a
mad crush on Carrell). The plot here isn&#x27;t the point anyway&#x97;except for
one pitch-perfect scene in which Gosling and Stone lie in bed together
and experience the true intimacy of really getting to know&#x97;and &#x22;click&#x22;
with&#x97;another person. The plot twists might be a bit contrived, but this
film has its heart in the right place. If this film doesn&#x27;t make you
smile, then you&#x27;ve probably never felt your pulse quicken or
experienced butterflies in your stomach when you lay eyes on the object
of your affection.
