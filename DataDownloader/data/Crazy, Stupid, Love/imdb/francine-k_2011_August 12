Crazy, Stupid, Love was really a great RomCom. Extremely funny, has the
heart melting effect and the actors and actresses were perfect for
their roles. Steve Carell never disappoints along with the brilliant
Ryan Gosling who is great with comedies, which we don&#x27;t regularly see
him in sadly. Emma Stone was as always laugh out loud funny and totally
relatable towards woman, showing what woman really do think when it
comes to guys, and Julianne Moore was fantastic for her depressed mid
life crisis cheater, was just hilarious. All of them together plus
amazing supporting cast made this movie a lovable watch. I would
definitely this movie to anyone who is looking to laugh and for some
fun. I would say that this movie deserves a solid 8/10
