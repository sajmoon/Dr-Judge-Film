When I first saw the trailer to this movie I wasn&#x27;t excited to see it
or anything like that since romantic comedies seemed to be just heading
towards just toilet humor a lot of times now a days. And just by seeing
the trailer I could sort of tell what the story was about and it turns
out I was wrong...And that is a good thing this time. Since the premise
isn&#x27;t entirely original but it&#x27;s much better than the direction it
could of went. A lot of the scenarios had a bit of the Asian drama vibe
to it with everything that is going on, well a very condensed version
of it and with more of a American flare to it. The main positive thing
about this movie is that just about everything from the premise, the
direction, the characters and the jokes...It just works for the most
part. I couldn&#x27;t help but be entertained by whats going to happen next,
I mean it&#x27;s sort of predictable but it&#x27;s how it&#x27;s delivered that makes
this movie fun and enthralling to watch. The humor in this is actually
witty, it&#x27;s more of the serious but funny humor and doesn&#x27;t rely on
toilet humor. It has a bit of sex humor than and there but it wasn&#x27;t
annoying and for the most part it was sort of clever how it&#x27;s
delivered. Another thing that makes this movie work is the cast, almost
all the cast fit right in with this movie and premise. Steve Carrell
did the whole mixture of comedic/serious thing almost perfectly and
Ryan Gosling played the ladies man really well, although sometimes it
seemed like he was playing himself. All the rest of the cast put on a
great performance and I guess it&#x27;s because of the performance but the
chemistry although short at times was believable for the most part.
Overall this is a dramatic romantic comedy that just about anyone would
enjoy. Unless your one of those annoying teens with a single digit IQ
that just makes stupid noises, take random pictures and hide behind
chairs constantly while other audiences are trying to watch a movie.
Which happened when I was watching this movie, to sum it up this isn&#x27;t
a stupid comedy and isn&#x27;t meant for stupid people that doesn&#x27;t have the
courtesy to just enjoy a movie while not bothering other people.
Anyways it may not be the funniest comedy but the direction of it all
is what makes this movie great.<br /><br />8.2/10
