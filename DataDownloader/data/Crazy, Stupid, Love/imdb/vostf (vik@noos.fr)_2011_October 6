The major achievement of Crazy, Stupid, Love is to bundle so much fun
and emotion, without a dull moment, in a basically routine suburban
family crisis setup. You can&#x27;t say this for a whole lot of movies each
year, unfortunately.<br /><br />It doesn&#x27;t start fast, it&#x27;s rather low key until you get your run
through the whole exposition. But it gathers momentum, scene after
scene situations become crazier while never spinning out of hand, and
characters are consistent and likable all along.<br /><br />With such a nice movie, delivering on all counts, you should be plenty
happy. Yet, if you really insist, typecast is Julianne Moore as the
neurotic suburban wife (but she does it very good and with some nuance
from previous assignments) and typecast is Marisa Tomei as the crazy
funny spicy litmus gal. These great actresses are really underused
here. For it&#x27;s more a movie about the guys, understanding them and have
some fun with them, but who cares about this bias as long as it works?
