Lets get one thing straight. I hate(d) pretty much all of the actors in
this movie. When my wife told my that she wanted to watch this, I
simply said &#x27;Sure&#x27; without even viewing the trailer or at the very
least the box-cover like I normally always do.<br /><br />What ensued was perhaps the most entertaining and maybe even slightly
life changing 2 hours I have had in my life.<br /><br />I&#x27;m 20 years old, this is a movie about a bunch of people in their
40&#x27;s. But I can relate to just about everything that happens in this
movie.<br /><br />Steve Carell was probably my least favourite actor in terms of &#x27;comedy&#x27;
and to throw him in a romance, I would have said that you had chosen
the worst man possible. I probably would have told you that Arnold
Schwarzenegger would be a better choice. Ever since I watched &#x27;The
Office&#x27; I had nothing to say about Steve Carell... but after seeing
this movie I truly realised that some people really can play more than
1 role.<br /><br />Then we have Julianne Moore, who, after I saw &#x27;Chloe&#x27; I put her at the
top of my &#x27;I never want to see a movie with her in it again&#x27; list.<br /><br />It&#x27;s hard to describe this movie. It&#x27;s long, very long. I hear you say
&#x22;It&#x27;s only 2 hours&#x22; but the amount of teeny tiny little details that
you&#x27;re fed in those 2 hours is insane. Not to mention the lengthy
amount of easily digestible and highly entertaining character
development.<br /><br />This movie is funny, it&#x27;s sad, it&#x27;s predictable, it&#x27;s completely
unpredictable and it&#x27;s got the most entertaining 10 minute scene I have
ever, ever, ever watched in my life.<br /><br />If you had told me that I would enjoy this movie even more than &#x27;Up in
the Air&#x27; and THAT! is saying something. I would have told you &#x22;Is that
err.. before or AFTER I win the lottery and single handedly find a cure
for cancer?&#x22; I am too stupid to explain this movie to anyone. But one
thing I can say for sure, this movie does not overdo &#x27;it&#x27; in the
slightest. Though I don&#x27;t know what exactly &#x27;it&#x27; is, &#x27;it&#x27; is just that
and this movie has &#x27;it&#x27; and the perfect amount of it.<br /><br />You will enjoy this movie. This is one movie that deserves to be
watched and I can&#x27;t say that about many movies I have seen.<br /><br />11 out of 10.
