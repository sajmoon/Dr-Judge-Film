I put off watching this film until this past weekend because I wasn&#x27;t
sure if it would be worth my money. I was unduly concerned. The film
was worth every penny. I might actually go watch it again. The story
was heartfelt, moving, entertaining and very well directed and acted.
Initially I thought I would be bored by the whole
stranger-gives-sad-sap-a-makeover-to-make- him-cool bit but it was done
in a very refreshing way. I thought the chemistry between Ryan Gosling
and Steve Carell was terrific and they should honestly do another film
together. <br /><br />Emma Stone&#x27;s scenes with Ryan Gosling were very romantic when I least
expected them to be. I thought that the romance angle would be the same
old boring stuff but it really wasn&#x27;t. All around, this movie surprised
me. I would definitely recommend people go check it out.
