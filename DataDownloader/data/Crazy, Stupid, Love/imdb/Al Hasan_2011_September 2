I... I loved it. Guess I can end my review right there. But I&#x27;m not
going to.<br /><br />I... was mind-blown, literally. I went into the theater all happy
because I was FINALLY gonna get to see &#x22;The new Emma Stone movie&#x22; (I&#x27;m
a huge fan), and I came out with a HUGE grin on my face. I literally
walked around with my teeth sticking out for about 10 minutes...
literally. The movie was... well to quote myself when my friend asked
me, &#x22;DUUUUUDE, IT WAS SOOOOO F****** AMAZING&#x22;.<br /><br />Hilarious... a few twists... heart-filled drama (I almost cried,
ALMOST)... and Emma Stone. I give it a 9/10 for awesomeness but a bit
(A BIT)of a bad script, some of the lines weren&#x27;t great, I was
expecting a few love quotes and also Emma Stone didn&#x27;t get enough
screen time (in my opinion)... but I guess that&#x27;s what make&#x27;s this
movie so great, it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.
