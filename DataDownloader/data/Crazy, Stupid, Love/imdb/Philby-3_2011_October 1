As the movie opens Cal Weaver&#x27;s humdrum but comfortable life as an
accountant in Beverly Hills is rudely shattered by his wife Emily
(Julianne Moore announcing in a crowded restaurant that she&#x27;s being
having an affair with a workmate and wants a divorce after 25 years
marriage. Cal (Steve Carell) moves out and drops in to the single bars
scene where for reasons not entirely clear (&#x22;you remind me of someone&#x22;)
lounge room Lothario Jacob (Ryan Gosling) who beds a different gorgeous
woman each night takes Cal in hand and trains him to be just as
successful. Meanwhile Cal&#x27;s 13 old son Robby (Johna Bobo) has fallen in
love with the family&#x27;s babysitter, High School student Jessica
(Analeigh Tipton) who in turn has a crush on Cal. Then Jacob actually
falls in love, with young lawyer Hanna (Emma Stone) and Emily starts to
yearn for her discarded husband.<br /><br />This all sounds like a conventional romantic comedy of the feel-good
variety, but directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa and writer Dan
Fogelman have a few surprises up their sleeves. The performances are
first-rate and the dialogue crackling. There is some reliance on
slapstick but also some real emotion conveyed. Ryan Gosling&#x27;s Jacob
might perhaps be too shallow to be true (&#x22;you look like you&#x27;ve been
photoshopped&#x22; says Emily, on seeing his torso), but it turns out that
even he has a credible backstory. As the principal lovers, Steve Carell
and Julianne Moore exhibit a realism seldom seen in romantic comedy and
there is some fine comic work from Maresa Tomei as one of Cal&#x27;s lounge
bar conquests who pops up a bit closer to home. At 120 minutes the film
is slow in places &#x96; I would describe the direction as quirky rather
than slick (how else can one explain the cinematographer&#x27;s penchant for
shoe-level shots) but more rewarding than the average rom-com, and
although the ending is contrived it&#x27;s still satisfying.<br /><br />The directors, whose best known previous works, &#x22;Bad Santa&#x22; and &#x22;I Love
You Phillip Morris&#x22; were decidedly quirky, have toned things down a bit
here, but the characters are credible and sympathetic. I also liked the
way the deep seated prudery and overdeveloped sense of decorum that
afflicts middle class Americans are sent up. After an unseemly though
perfectly understandable brawl in the Weaver&#x27;s picture perfect back
yard it falls to Vietnamese-American Officer Huang to tell the warring
parties to do their fighting inside where the neighbours can&#x27;t hear. I
also liked Cal&#x27;s line as he is rejected again by Emily outside Robbies&#x27;
high school after a disastrous parent teacher interview and it starts
to rain: &#x22;This is such a clich&#xE9;&#x22;. Well I suppose anyone going to see a
rom-com ought to be prepared for clich&#xE9;s, but here they are cleverly
handled, if a little sugar-coated.
