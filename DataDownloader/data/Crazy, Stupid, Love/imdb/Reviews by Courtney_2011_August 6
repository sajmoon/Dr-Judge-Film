**No Worries, No Spoilers** Crazy, Stupid, Love is a perfect title for
this movie! It&#x27;s all about love obviously, and how it can vary between
gender and ages. In the beginning, I thought it was funny, but was kind
of wondering where it was going. Well, if you go to watch it, don&#x27;t
worry about it, because the end shows all the connections in a
hilarious way. It has to be one of the best endings to a movie that
I&#x27;ve seen in a while. Steve Carell is a great actor and shows his
softer, sad side, but does it in a quirky, funny way. Ryan Gosling also
plays his character to perfection! It&#x27;s a fun, light-hearted movie,
with an outstanding cast. I would and have recommended it to friends!
Worth your money just for the ending and to see Ryan Gosling with out a
shirt!
