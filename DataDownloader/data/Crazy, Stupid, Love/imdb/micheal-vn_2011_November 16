Not many movies every adults could enjoy like this. This like Oscar-
winning &#x22;Crash&#x22; storyline, with a twist of humour in it. And when you
talk &#x22;Crash&#x22; material, it is the real thing, whether you like it or
now. <br /><br />The storyline is an epidemy of family relationship. The sidekick &#x22;pick
up artist&#x22; although clich&#xE9; but is utilised to an extreme here, making
it quite unique.<br /><br />The dialogue Laughter is like the opposite conundrum of tears, and
Pearl Harbour can make you trickle that precious drop, this movie will
make you blow your windpipe laughing.<br /><br />There&#x27;s only one word to describe this movie: &#x22;Grandeur&#x22;. Totally
highly recommended. No R18 scenes in this movie, only nearly.<br /><br />P.S. And to Steve Carrell, you brought my surprise of Vietnamese to a
new level (Calling Emily = Em, which is sweetheart in Vietnamese).
