This movie will keep you guessing throughout. It&#x27;s a funny and sweet
story of life mixed in with all types of love. Steve Carell plays a
great sullen character (as always) in reaction to his chaotic
surroundings. He is mentored by a mysterious, wealthy, and handsome
young man, in which he learns a thing or two about picking up women,
and fulfilling his inner man self. You&#x27;re never too old to learn
something new, and you&#x27;re never too young to love. This movie is filled
with surprises, leaving the audience in dumbstruck in some cases. Love
isn&#x27;t always clear; sometimes it&#x27;s crazy, and stupid. The journey of
love is always surprising; especially when you re-evaluate your life at
the same time.
