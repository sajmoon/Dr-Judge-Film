First of all - amazing cast. I knew nothing about this movie, so I was
surprised by more great actors popping out every time: Ryan Gosling,
Marisa Tomei, Kevin Bacon, Emma Stone (who easily becomes a favorite of
mine), John Carroll Lynch and Julianne Moore. I have nothing against
Steve Carell, but he&#x27;s really the weakest link here. Then again, I have
nothing for him, he&#x27;s just... Steve Carell, the same character in every
movie.<br /><br />Gosling, Stone and Tomei (whose screen time is criminally short) are
really the highlight of the movie. The three of them are fantastic.
Gosling, a favorite of mine, proves time after time that he&#x27;s a
wonderful actor and continues to give excellent performance in every
movie.<br /><br />The movie itself is really uneven. There are some wonderful scenes and
dialogs, but other scenes are not that great and the plot... hm... I
can&#x27;t put my hands on it, but it&#x27;s not constructed well enough.<br /><br />Still, some good laughs and the cast is excellent.<br /><br />5/10 Recommended
