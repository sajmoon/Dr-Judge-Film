I can&#x27;t even remember the last time Steve Carell was actually in a good
movie. In the past decade he&#x27;s been in a lot of &#x22;hit or miss&#x22; type
flicks. Emphasis on the &#x22;miss&#x22; with movies like Dinner for Schmucks,
Date Night, Get Smart, Dan in Real Life, and especially Evan Almighty.
Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still laughed, just didn&#x27;t enjoy the cinema. The
40 Year Old Virgin and Little Miss Sunshine were the only true Carell
flicks that I enjoyed in roundabout way.<br /><br />With that being said, 2011 brings us Crazy, Stupid, Love. A quaint
little rom-com flick under the direction of duo Glenn Ficarra and John
Requa, who came together once again after their tag team direction of
R- rated rom-com I Love You Phillip Morris. Being released two years
apart, their movie direction definitely improved.<br /><br />On to the movie review itself.<br /><br />Crazy, Stupid, Love begins with the divorce dinner of two of the main
characters, Steve Carell&#x27;s Cal and Julianne Moore&#x27;s Emily. Cal is
immediately deemed by the audience be the &#x22;loser&#x22; or &#x22;40 Year Old
Virgin&#x22; type character he does so well. Even a little bit of Michael
Scott from NBC&#x27;s The Office can be felt. I was definitely excited at
this point and the movie just started!<br /><br />The next scene introduces us to Cal&#x27;s 13-year-old son, Robbie, played
by Jonah Bobo. For being only an age older in real life, I thought
little Jonah Bobo did a spectacular job. Immediately we see that he is
madly in love with his 17-year-old babysitter, Jessica, played by
Analeigh Tipton. This situation alone fuels some of the comedy.<br /><br />The casting really does add so much more appeal to this film. Details
ahead. I was also surprised to witness how funny a PG-13 rated movie
really could be, while maintaining a classy feel. No raunchy comedy
here. No &#x22;F-bombs&#x22; here. No slap-stick. Sure, the characters cheat and
seem to be angry at times, but they understand their mistakes.<br /><br />We figure out that Emily is fooling around with a guy at work played by
Kevin Bacon. Interestingly funny is Bacon.<br /><br />After Cal finds himself completely depressed by the thought of his
divorce, he sobs at a local cocktail bar. Here he overhears, thus
finding Ryan Gosling&#x27;s character, Jacob, who is undoubtedly the
complete ladies&#x27; man. Even actor Ryan Reynolds admits his abs to be
more superior than his own. Ryan Gosling is the superior actor as well.
Really enjoyed his performance.<br /><br />From here Jacob agrees to help Cal make the most of himself and teaches
him the way of the &#x22;Ladies&#x27; Man.&#x22; That&#x27;s when the movie really begins.
The humor that perspires from the interaction of Cal and the women at
the bar was delightful.<br /><br />The movie does slow down towards the middle with clich&#xE9; montages, but
seemingly picks itself up.<br /><br />Eventually Cal finds himself a real catch in the form of Marisa Tomei&#x27;s
character named Kate. While this is going on, Jacob, the man who taught
Cal how to score all those girls, falls in love with Emma Stone&#x27;s
character, Hannah. Cal is not happy about that.<br /><br />Without giving away too much of the plot, I will say that I really
enjoyed all of the O-M-G worthy plot-twists that took place. You&#x27;ll
just have to see for yourself. Take a date.<br /><br />8/10 Stars.
