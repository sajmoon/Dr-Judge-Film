This is a very funny movie, but it also has serious content. We see two
characters, who represent two kinds of &#x22;crazy, stupid love.&#x22; Jacob is
constantly picking up girls at bars, taking them back to his apartment,
and having sex with them. This is shown as a silly way of living when
he finally meets a girl who ridicules his tactics. On the other hand,
Cal has been in a marriage for 25 years and considers himself to have
found his soul mate. But there seems to be no basis for why he should
be together with his wife - they just reminisce and talk to fill the
empty space. There are several scenes in the movie where the idea of a
&#x22;soul mate&#x22; is made to sound incredibly silly. So if both these kinds
of love are silly, where are we left to go? Is there any kind of love
that is not silly? Perhaps the relationship between Jacob and the girl
who ridicules him shows some way forward. They both seem to be happy,
at least. Their secret seems to be that they have found something
novel. Is novelty the way forward?
