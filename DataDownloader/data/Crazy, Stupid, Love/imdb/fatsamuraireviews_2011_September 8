It has been a while since I have seen a good comedy that layers story
elements as finely as this movie did. This film has an excellent sense
of comedic timing and was enjoyable to watch. There are three sets of
couples all working on finding and defending love. The cast was well
chosen and I felt each did a stupendous job in bringing these everyday
struggles to light. I really love the humor in this film. I can&#x27;t
remember the last film that made me laugh out loud. The writing was so
well done I was completely taken over by the story and taken in with
the journey of these characters. This movie gets a green light from me.<br /><br />To read more of this review go to
