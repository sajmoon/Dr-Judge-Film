I thought when I sat down to watch this that it would just be another
silly film with Steve Carell in it but I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong.
It&#x27;s a very well written romantic comedy that looks at the life of
Steve&#x27;s character Cal Weaver who has been asked for a divorce by his
wife and &#x22;soul mate&#x22;. Ryan Goslings character Jacob sees that Cal is
distraught And offers to help him become a better man and a womanizer
with Some funny results. The film also looks at his 13 yr old sons
crush on his 17 yr old baby sitter that is also very entertaining. It&#x27;s
just a brilliant heart warming film with brilliant acting. Steve Carell
is brilliant in it as is Ryan Gosling. Enjoyed every minute of it. The
best romantic comedy I&#x27;ve seen to date hands down.
