The best thing about this movie (and there many great things) is the
screenplay. Though I thought there were a few script problems toward
the end, perhaps some shortcuts had to be made in order to keep the
movie under two hours.<br /><br />The second scene between Jacob and Hannah is absolutely amazing, as
Hannah unintentionally gives Jacob some important perspective on his
life, and not by way of a lecture. For example, Hannah makes Jacob
self-conscious about his appearance--compare that to a similar earlier
scene. The Jacob/Hannah encounter is so well-written, so funny, and so
well-acted, it&#x27;s one reason I want to see the film again soon.<br /><br />Another instance of amazing screen writing is the scene which has Emily
on the phone by the kitchen sink. The script furnishes an occasion for
an actress to put so much across without really saying anything
important, and Julianne Moore is terrific.<br /><br />Marisa Tomei is given the chance for a star turn, and does it
perfectly.<br /><br />There are some flaws toward the end, and this is not a perfect film.
But nearly so: extremely funny, well-written and well-acted.
