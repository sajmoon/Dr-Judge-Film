Unification of Love: Awkwardly Realistic Circumstances<br /><br />Three love stories nay, situations, are explored in Directors Glenn
Ficarra and John Requa&#x27;s (&#x22;I Love You Phillip Morris&#x22;) &#x22;Crazy, Stupid
Love&#x22;. It is a drama masked as a comedy fueled by awkwardly realistic
circumstances and a handful of highflying actors and actresses that
know how to own it. The first story concerns a couple of high school
sweethearts, Cal (Steve Carell, &#x22;Dinner for Schmucks&#x22;) and Emily Weaver
(Julianne Moore, &#x22;The Kids Are All Right&#x22;),that have been married for
twenty-five years. However, when Emily tells Cal that slept with a man
she works with named David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon, &#x22;X-Men: First
Class&#x22;), divorce is on the horizon. Inevitably sending Cal to the bar,
Cal meets the player in the second love story, Jacob Palmer (Ryan
Gosling, &#x22;Blue Valentince&#x22;), who is infamous for his lady-wooing
swagger. Jacob sees and hears Cal ranting about his failing marriage
and takes him under his wing to help him move on with other women. Even
so, Cal may not be the only one changed by their abnormal friendship
because of Jacob&#x27;s hang up on a girl named Hannah (Emma Stone, &#x22;Easy
A&#x22;) he was rejected by the previous night. Meanwhile, Cal and Emily&#x27;s
thirteen-year-old son, Robbie (Jonah Bobo, &#x22;Zathura&#x22;), is in love with
his babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton, &#x22;The Green Hornet&#x22;) who in
turn is in love with Cal. Everything is more connected than you may
think and with a flamboyantly annoying performance by Marisa Tomei
(&#x22;The Wrestler&#x22;) things get crazy and stupid in this multigenerational
love story.<br /><br />The Good: Steve Carell&#x27;s Post-&#x22;Office&#x22; years could not of had a
stronger start as he conjures the second best performance of his
career. However, it would be unfair to say that he is the only reason
the film succeeds because of the superb performances of his costars
Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore and Emma Stone. Together the cast will
keep you on edge as the story unravels in an obstinately realistic
manner. And while Scriptwriter Dan Fogelman&#x27;s (&#x22;Bolt&#x22;) plan was not
visible at first by the end his twisty-turny storytelling culminates in
grade A fashion with the unification of the three love stories into one
full of smart comedy<br /><br />After the aforementioned culmination of plot unification, the film
loses its momentum. dragging on for twenty minutes. The film could have
ended anytime during its climatic scene and it would have been perfect
(I guess you can&#x27;t always get what you want). It takes twenty extra
minutes to get to the actual sloppy and impractical conclusion. Even
though everything seemed to be previously settled, this second fallout
to set up a preachy ending creates unnecessary forced conflict. Lastly,
the inability to avoid predictivity may irk some viewers and makes
characters like Josh Groban&#x27;s as pointless as their casting.<br /><br />The first act of &#x22;Crazy, Stupid Love&#x22; creates a series of situations
that setup a remarkable amalgamation at the peak of its second act,
making the stars in the film (most notably Steve Carell) into even
bigger stars with the power of sharp comedy.
