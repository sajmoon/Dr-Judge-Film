I loved this movie. I really expected it to be another worthless mix
between a bro/chick flick, but by the end, I was pleasantly surprised.
It was really fun, and funny also. The all-star cast made things even
better. I love Steve Carrel and if you watch the Office, you will see
little glimpses of Michael Scott, which is unfortunate, seeing as how I
can only see him in that role now.<br /><br />However, the twist at the end completely caught me off-guard, and
although it took a while, as soon as it happened, I fell in love with
the movie. It changes the way all the characters look to you, and it
really pushes things to a new area that wasn&#x27;t before shown. Enjoy this
film please!
