I saw this expecting an amusing, albeit predictable, movie. Boy was I
pleasantly surprised! <br /><br />Steve Carell plays a man, Cal, blindsided by his wife&#x27;s sudden request
for a divorce. While wallowing in self pity at the local bar, Jacob
(Ryan Gossling) decides to turn him into a project, and introduce him
to the wonderful world of womanizing.....But you&#x27;ve seen that from the
previews right? What comes next is a great look at love, from first
crushes to long term marriage.<br /><br />This movie is the perfect blend of funny and sweet (the entire theatre
was laughing throughout). Great performances from the whole cast,
including a surprisingly refreshing change for Steve Carell. The
writing was perfect, the pacing was great.... A perfect date movie! Not
overly sappy and not typical &#x22;chick flick&#x22; drivel.
