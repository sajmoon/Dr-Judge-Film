Read the other reviews and you&#x27;ll see why you should see this movie.
One of the best movies about love since &#x22;Shakespeare in Love.&#x22;<br /><br />It&#x27;s good enough to overcome two annoyances:<br /><br />1. The music. Worst. Music. Ever. Poorly mixed, and poor choices in
songs. Extremely boring, non-hummable, overly earnest and wooden male
singers singing songs you&#x27;ve never heard of. The soundtrack music is
even worse. It sounds like a stoned musician noodling on the keyboard.
Heavyhanded and annoying music cues without melodies. I&#x27;ve never heard
a major studio release with such amateur music.<br /><br />2. Josh Grobin as an actor in a movie with an otherwise superlative
cast. Josh is... kind of adequate. The rest of the cast of this movie
is insanely good, every little part, every line. To throw in a
non-actor who has minimal charisma and no timing was a casting error.
He doesn&#x27;t ruin his scenes, but he certainly slows them down with his
hollow and wooden performance. I can only imagine the dozens of takes
they needed to get enough footage to cut the scenes together. It&#x27;s most
obvious in his climactic scene with Emma Stone, when they keep the
camera on her for a very, very long time. When normally they&#x27;d cut away
to the actor in the scene, they pretty much abandon Josh and leave us
enjoying the incandescent Emma Stone, who has enough charisma and
acting chops to wash away the presence of the plodding Grobin acting.<br /><br />These are quibbles -- the movie rises above the poor music choices and
Grobin moments. It rises very high indeed.
