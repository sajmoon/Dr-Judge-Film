Love is the be-all and end-all of life. It&#x27;s crazy, it&#x27;s stupid, but
you have to put everything towards winning over your soul-mate. That is
what all of the characters believe. Except Jacob (Ryan Gosling). He
believes that people who are in love are pathetic. Thank God for Ryan
Gosling. I&#x27;ve been saying that a lot recently, but it&#x27;s true. He makes
everything he&#x27;s in better.<br /><br />Here, he wants to improve Cal (Steve Carell). Cal&#x27;s wife (Julianne
Moore) has announced she wants a divorce, so he jumps out of the car
and winds up at a very swanky bar. The bar is basically Jacob&#x27;s turf
where he knows how to win over all women and get them to sleep with
him. Disgusted by Cal&#x27;s pathetic demeanor, we then get a man-makeover.<br /><br />The best part of this movie is that they make everything funny. From
divorce, to objectifying women, to inappropriate soul-mates, to
depression, everything is funny. It&#x27;s not darkly comic or making you
laugh out of awkwardness, but taking real situations and making them
genuinely funny. I frequently found myself laughing just waiting for
Gosling&#x27;s next line. His comedic chemistry between both Carell and Emma
Stone was perfect.<br /><br />Analeigh Tipton, a young Liv Tyler-type actress, plays the babysitter
with the inappropriate crush, but I liked her. She added another layer
to the role with a little bit of sassiness and a fresh take to the
character.<br /><br />&#x22;Crazy, Stupid, Love.&#x22; is supposed to be your standard romantic comedy,
where you know exactly what you&#x27;re getting. But it is directed by the
comic geniuses behind &#x22;I Love You Phillip Morris&#x22; and &#x22;Bad Santa&#x22;, and
you should know by that that this really isn&#x27;t all the predictable. It
has twists. I know, a romantic comedy with twists! They&#x27;re inventive,
fun, and most importantly, hilarious.
