Crazy Stupid Love is with no doubts the best (modern) rom-com ever and
it&#x27;s without doubts, my seventh favorite movie and I&#x27;m not a fan of
romance movies. Let me tell you why I loved it, first of all, it
doesn&#x27;t include those Hollywood clich&#xE9;, what makes it an original
movie, the plot was amazingly written, it had a few genius twists and
every single part of it was fantastic. The cast was fantastic, it
included one of my favorite actors, Steve Carell, who was just amazing
here, It included Ryan Gosling, his great performance was worthy of a
Golden Globe nomination. It included Julianne Moore, who was just okay
here. It included Emma Stone, who was amazing here. And the cast also
included Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon. The soundtrack was amazing and
the rest was also amazing. Sow, as you can see, so far, I didn&#x27;t said
there was something bad about this movie, for one simple reason, there
isn&#x27;t, what leaves me able to say that Crazy Stupid Love is a perfect
film. Sow, men, women, movie lovers, you all should watch Crazy Stupid
Love, it is a rom-com surprisingly clich&#xE9;-free, it knew how to separate
the romance from the hilarious comedy and providing you a fantastic
movie with a few touching moments and a few hilarious moments. Watch it
right not if you haven&#x27;t, it&#x27;s the best (rom-) comedy I&#x27;ve seen since
Horrible Bosses, it&#x27;s worth watching it more than twice because all of
the viewings will be an amazing waste of time, a waste of air by the
big quantity of jokes and a waste of tears, at least for girls, not for
me. <br /><br />Crazy Stupid Love: *****<br /><br />10/10: Sow, Crazy Stupid Love is one of the first rom-com&#x27;s that can be
recommended for men and women and it&#x27;s clear that everybody will love
it, I mean, I&#x27;m a man and I consider Crazy Stupid Love one of the 10
best movies ever made.
