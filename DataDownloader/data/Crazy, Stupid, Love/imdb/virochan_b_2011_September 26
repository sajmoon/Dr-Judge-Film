It is a movie which has shown love in all forms, that is why the title.
Love is crazy and stupid. From the middle aged character of Steve
Carell to the love story of his son of about 13 yr old. The movie has
many layers of stories in it. <br /><br />Steve Carell gets to know that his wife needs a divorce in the first
scene of the movie. Then on the movie starts about what he does trying
to raise two kids alongside. Ryan helps him shred his old style geeky
look and helps him to get a makeover. I will not divulge any more
details as it is better you watch the movie without any more pointers
from the reviews.<br /><br />The comedy element is kept alive through out the film by its wonderful
screenplay,also giving it a heart and touchy feel when needed. The huge
star cast of brilliant actors all holding there own in this must watch
romantic comedy of this year 2011.
