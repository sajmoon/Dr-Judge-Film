I saw the Premier and thought..ya another chick flick.<br /><br />Was I pleasantly surprised!<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.<br /><br />The actors did a great job and I knew I&#x27;d seen a Winner when the
Audience applauded at the end of the Movie.<br /><br />Congrats to the Director and the Writers! I love to see this quality of
writing.<br /><br />I was trying to figure out where does this fit in and low and
behold,,,,<br /><br />There&#x27;s a few twists that may take you by surprise:)<br /><br />Go see it and enjoy!
