2011_August 25 
Well, I would say we have seen the same story again n again. Only the
difference here is they have some twist in the end, which I found
totally out of place. This movie was a total let down, and I would not
recommend anybody wasting their time. The whole execution the story is
really poor in my opinion and none of the scenes make a lasting
impression. I had expected a better movie than this and the twist in
end I found as been put together forcibly just because they want some
twist to regular story. Well let me talk about performances: Steve
Carell is good, gets advantage as he is producer of film. Julliane is
OK..Kevin is small role(really good actor), Emma stone just lost her
one fan in me. I mean seriously. Ryan is OK and gets little scope but
good as flamboyant playboy. His story is undeveloped and should have
been better told. Steve Carell&#x27;s youngest daughter is really good
actress. If you have not watched her film then you should check out
Ramona and Beezus. Rest of the cast is OK and did give OK performances.
