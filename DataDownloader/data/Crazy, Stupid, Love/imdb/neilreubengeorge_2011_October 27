If you really love someone you have to fight for them till the end&#x85;
this movie shows us that, it also show us the crazy and stupid things
we do for love. Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore and Emma
Stone make up the key players in this movie. Steve Carell plays Cal
Weaver who has a marriage crisis and Ryan Gosling plays Jacob Palmer
who sees Cal Weaver in a bar and tries to help him. The move is filled
with comedy and emotion, one scene is filled with comedy and the other
with emotion overall the movie is good to watch. It&#x27;s not your usual
Steve Carell movie with a lot of laughs, it&#x27;s one of those movies which
has some funny scenes and gives a nice message. So if you&#x27;re expecting
to laugh your guts out, this is not the movie for you.<br /><br />It&#x27;s a nice movie&#x85; this is one move you watch with some girls, don&#x27;t
watch it with your guy friends.<br /><br />Like my reviews, visit my blog: http://nrgmoviereview.blogspot.com
