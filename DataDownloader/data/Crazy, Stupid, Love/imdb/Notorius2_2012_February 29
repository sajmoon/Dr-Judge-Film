Crazy, Stupid, Love is definitely on my top 3 Romantic comedies of all
times, with the other two being Love actually, and Kate and Leopold.
(The first two are much more superior in every way than Kate and
Leopold but someone had to be third at third place). And this comes
from a person that don&#x27;t usually watch Romantic comedies but prefer
action films.<br /><br />Crazy, Stupid, Love except from being funny in a sweet way also has a
team of interesting characters that makes you wish the movie was 3
hours long just to see those characters expand more. Its a film that
gets your attention from the first minute and that surprises you with
an incredibly funny ending and makes it a movie to watch with any of
your family and friends.
