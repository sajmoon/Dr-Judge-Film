&#x27;CRAZY, STUPID, LOVE&#x27;: Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br /><br />Steve Carell returning to what he does best, emotionally sweet but
honest comedy-drama. After a couple mediocre to dud films (like &#x27;DATE
NIGHT&#x27;, &#x27;DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS&#x27; and &#x27;DESPICABLE ME&#x27;). It&#x27;s nice to see
Carell getting back to higher caliber quality comedy (like his much
better earlier films &#x27;THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN&#x27; and &#x27;LITTLE MISS
SUNSHINE&#x27;). He&#x27;s not the only reason to see the film though, like those
earlier noted films, this is an ensemble piece made up of a lot of
great talented actors such as Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore, Emma Stone
and Marisa Tomei. It&#x27;s directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (who
also co-directed &#x27;I LOVE YOU PHILLIP MORRIS&#x27;) and written by Dan
Fogelman (who&#x27;s worked on the screenplays for several kids&#x27; films
including both &#x27;CARS&#x27;, &#x27;TANGLED&#x27; and &#x27;FRED CLAUS&#x27;). The film tells the
story of a recently dumped father who attracts the sympathy and
mentoring of a younger popular &#x27;ladie&#x27;s man&#x27; bachelor. Carell plays the
sad father and Gosling co-stars as the hip &#x27;hot shot&#x27; womanizer. It&#x27;s a
well made and effective buddy film with a lot to say about love,
relationships and family life as well.<br /><br />The film opens with Cal (Carell) and his wife Emily (Moore) sitting
down to a nice dinner in a beautiful restaurant when Emily tells Cal
she wants a divorce, much to Cal&#x27;s surprise. On the drive home she also
lets him in on the information that she&#x27;s had an affair to which Cal
responds by jumping from the moving vehicle. Cal takes it like a man
and moves into a small apartment but is devastated inside. Their two
young children, Robbie (Jonah Bobo) and Molly (Joey King), are hurt by
the news as well. Robbie is a thirteen year old with apparent wisdom
well beyond his years and has just professed his love to the family
babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), who secretly has an obsessive
crush on Cal. While telling his sob story repeatedly (to anyone who
will listen, or won&#x27;t even) at a local club Cal attracts the attention
of Jacob (Gosling) who offers to teach Cal all he knows so he can
hopefully &#x27;regain his manhood&#x27;. The two bond during their experiment
but things become complicated when Emily begins to show feelings for
Cal again and Jacob falls for a young lovely woman (Stone).<br /><br />The film is grade A material and production values all around; the cast
is outstanding (especially Carell and Gosling, two of my favorite
actors), the directing is decent, the film looks great and the script
is smart and fun. It&#x27;s equally as funny as emotionally charged and
honest, although it does lose it&#x27;s way a little towards the end. Like
many, many comedic dramas before it the movie takes brief turns into
somewhat sappy slapstick. It&#x27;s a minor amount of screen time but it
does come at key points in the film, which does take away a little from
it&#x27;s otherwise greatness. This is it&#x27;s only true flaw though and you
get so much more good from the film than bad. It&#x27;s like at least twice
as good as something like &#x27;DATE NIGHT&#x27;. It&#x27;s refreshing to see Carell
return to form and actors like Gosling and Moore branching out a little
(from their usual all too serious Oscar bait). As a buddy film it
really works, as an emotional drama it really works as well and as a
comedy it&#x27;s equally as impressive. Other than the previously mentioned
flaw it is a near perfect example of it&#x27;s genre and definitely worth
checking out.<br /><br />Watch our review show &#x27;MOVIE TALK&#x27; at:
