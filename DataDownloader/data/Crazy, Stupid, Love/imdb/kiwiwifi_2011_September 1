Most of the rave reviews for this movie are WAY over the top which now
makes me suspicious. I don&#x27;t want to be too harsh on the movie (as it
is what it is). But, the combination of the great reviews and the
mediocre movie has really made me upset and I wasted $36. Something
here is askew. The net result is that made me mad. I should have smelt
a rat... Even my wife felt we were ripped off and she is usually very
forgiving of romantic comedies. It was a 5.5 all day... I would have
gone to something else if I had of known.
