There is a moment (or two), where the movie is close to lose its way or
get off its track. But it&#x27;s only a momentary thing that will go away
almost instantly. It manages to go through the clich&#xE9;s without hurting
itself. And while women might only be interested in Ryan Gosling (and
who can blame them?), there is more to the movie than that. It is rare
that a romantic comedy can be as good as this.<br /><br />And while other movies try to up the ante on raunchiness, this one
almost goes the opposite direction and does a great job in doing so.
With Carell, Gosling, Stone, Moore and Tomei you have excellent actors
who can convey almost anything, if the material is right. And right it
is! Even if the end feels a bit like a cheat, it gets away with it. You
won&#x27;t really mind ...
