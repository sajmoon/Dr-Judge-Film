I was pleasantly surprised, and really enjoyed seeing this movie at a
premiere this week.<br /><br />I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, so it took me a bit by surprise that it
was so funny and touching in a lot of ways.<br /><br />It seemed to try to demonstrate that every person in this world has
unique, loving, characteristics and that they might not be readily
apparent on the surface.<br /><br />It reminded me a lot of &#x22;Playing by Heart&#x22;, and in some ways the less
enjoyable &#x22;Love, Actually&#x22;.<br /><br />Those two movies had similar characteristics but weren&#x27;t as funny as
Crazy, Stupid, Love.<br /><br />The comedic aspects of this movie will appeal to the guys in the
audience that don&#x27;t normally like sappy love stories, so overall this
is a movie that has something for everyone.<br /><br />Highly recommended, and I give it a 10/10 even though its not perfect
(but what movie is?).
