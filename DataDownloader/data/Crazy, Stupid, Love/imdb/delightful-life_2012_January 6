If you have read the story line - then this looks like another clich&#xE9;d
movie. I saw it only because of its good rating, and boy am I glad.
:-)..............<br /><br />Steve Carell (The Office) is absolutely brilliant. The Office lost its
steam once he left, he is someone who can carry an entire cast, he is
that good! <br /><br />And Ryan Gosling, he was quite good in Drive, and he does it again
here. I think we have another huge actor coming up here and we will be
seeing him in a &#x27;lot&#x27; of movies for the next 20 years.<br /><br />Emma Stone (Easy A), another excellent performance.<br /><br />The entire cast is good.<br /><br />This is one heck of a stylish movie, very well directed and
choreographed. I just saw captain America and came away disappointed,
that had a fantastic story and they spoiled it. Here they had a clich&#xE9;d
story and they have turned it around into something cool and fun.<br /><br />Hats off...............<br /><br />Go see it, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Cheers! :-)...............
