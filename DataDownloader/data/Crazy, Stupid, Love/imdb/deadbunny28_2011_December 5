Once I read a review where Roger Ebert mentioned how for the entire
movie he sat there with a stupid grin on his face. That is similar to
how I felt about Crazy, Stupid, Love. Only this had moments of
outbursts of laughter, a few tears at the end, followed by an ear to
ear smile.<br /><br />This movie is magical in the sense it is a true over achiever, a
warrior in the time of &#x27;sloth-ness&#x27; in the world of film. It seems as
though the directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa were given a script
that could have been your generic Hollywood romantic-comedy and through
great understanding of love and pain as well as adept skill they
transformed it into something far more grandeur.<br /><br />All of the performances were outstanding&#x85;Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling
were knockouts. Steve Carell is able to shift between his usual comedic
prowess to earnest empathetic drama. Meanwhile Ryan Gosling continues
to prove himself as one of the most talented actors of the neoteric
age. All of the side performances were great as well. I was quite
impressed with young Jonah Bobo, Emma Stone shines through with her
charismatic charm that I am growing fond of, and Marisa Tomei is
absolutely hilarious in this.<br /><br />I went into this movie expecting another generic clich&#xE9; love story, but
there is so much care put into the characters here, and the concepts
are fleshed out so skillfully that it is so much more than that. This
movie is a contender for best movie of the year and might just be a new
personal favorite of mine. Unless your heart is literally made of
stone, this is a must see movie. 10/10
