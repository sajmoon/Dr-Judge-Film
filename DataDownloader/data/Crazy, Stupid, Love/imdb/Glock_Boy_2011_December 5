I rented this movie thinking I would score big points in selecting a
funny, romantic movie on the night of my wife&#x27;s 43rd birthday.<br /><br />She ended up not liking it, but I, on the other hand, thought it was a
hoot. So, guys, don&#x27;t be surprised if you end of sleeping on the couch
after renting this one for your date or significant other.<br /><br />This film represents the romantic changes and challenges we face as we
mature.<br /><br />Seen from all perspectives (15-year old boy, 18 year old girl,
20-something bachelor, 40-something parents), you come away bewildered
at the complexities of love, marriage and relationships in general.<br /><br />How do we marry and keep it fresh after so many years? How does a
career bachelor finally find true love? How does a boy express feelings
about his babysitter? How do we know we are with the right companion? I
liked this film because it touched a nerve with me, and spoke certain
truths that I hadn&#x27;t considered before.<br /><br />My wife, on the other hand, couldn&#x27;t get past the multiple triangles of
relationship building (especially amongst the younger characters), and
I think checked out mentally before she should have.<br /><br />This is a quality piece of work with some solid acting, character
development and a few surprises at the end. Oh yeah, it&#x27;s pretty darn
funny too.
