Our ultimate expectations of a romance film are hypocritical. On one
hand, we expect a grounded film: real people in real relationships with
real feelings doing not necessarily sane but at least rational things
in the name of love. On the other hand, we relish in fairytale
depictions of love and the idea that true love finds a way and other
poetic notions such as soul mates. &#x22;Crazy, Stupid, Love&#x22; fights this
battle longer and to more extreme degrees than anything before it.
Those with the fairytale soft-spot will take to it instantly, but even
those who tip their scales in favor of believable romance will find
something that resonates.<br /><br />Heartfelt and natural performances from a range of excellent actors
yanks this out of the rom-com nebula and into something seemingly more
tangible. With talents lesser than Steve Carell, Julianne Moore, Ryan
Gosling and Emma Stone, this would not only be a rom-com, but also the
flamboyant marshal of the rom-com parade. Although powerless against
the clich&#xE9; moments and improbable romantic gestures of Dan Fogelman&#x27;s
script, they add incredible emotional realism to his smaller, more
intimate moments.<br /><br />Carell stars as Cal Weaver who in the opening seconds learns that his
wife, Emily (Moore), wants a divorce. After throwing himself from their
car when learning she had an affair with David Linhagen (Kevin Bacon),
he goes home and prematurely squeals the news to his babysitter, high
schooler Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), who happens to have a crush on him.
His 13-year-old son, Robbie (Jonah Bobo), also overhears &#x97; and he&#x27;s got
a crush on Jessica.<br /><br />Once again, with generic rom-com mainstays in place, bringing a sense
of realism to this convenient and nearly farcical romantic chaos
would&#x27;ve been almost impossible. Carell has his character on lock down,
blending his &#x22;The 40-Year-Old Virgin&#x22; and &#x22;Dan in Real Life&#x22; characters
into an earnest yet loony portrait of a middle-aged man learning to
float after his lifelong stability gives out on him. Moore deftly
navigates the territory of a woman in midlife crisis who&#x27;s emotionally
unsatisfied but completely unsure how to handle it. In contrast, Robbie
is so completely far from a typical 13-year-old boy it&#x27;s insulting. If
his relentless pursuit of Jessica ever finally clicks in any form of
the word, it&#x27;s not until the very end and the fact that it basically
works at that point is nothing short of magic.<br /><br />Then there&#x27;s Jacob (Gosling), the handsome (I&#x27;m underselling him)
womanizer who takes a dejected Carell under his wing and teaches him
the ways (&#x22;Karate Kid&#x22; references abounding) of the bar pick up. He&#x27;s
such a smooth natural in his role he could pick up someone watching
this movie despite their knowledge of being played. Jacob&#x27;s backstory
(why he&#x27;s at this bar every night picking up women) ends up a casualty,
which was really a big mistake, but Gosling has such a strong way with
transparency that we believe all Jacob says or does. There&#x27;s no doubt
that he actually feels something for Hannah (Stone), even if it
materializes way faster than it should.<br /><br />Quickness and exaggeration are two of the chief factors of &#x22;Crazy,
Stupid, Love&#x22; that threaten to derail it in the eyes of those looking
for grounding to their romance. Cal&#x27;s gut reaction to his wife&#x27;s
divorce request, not trying to rectify the situation instead of bailing
for the bar, seems hasty. After learning well from Jacob and becoming a
ladies&#x27; man himself, his attempts to get Emily back don&#x27;t gel, perhaps
because they come at the ushering of his unrealistic 13- year-old son.
Especially when the film reaches it&#x27;s big revealing climax, the rash
reactions and failures to communicate get really frustrating.<br /><br />&#x22;Crazy, Stupid, Love&#x22; dashes willy-nilly between moments of emotional
realism and romantic exaggeration and realistic humor and comedic
exaggeration, enough to make your head spin. After all, this was
directed by Glen Ficarra and John Requa, the team behind &#x22;Bad Santa&#x22;
and &#x22;I Love You, Phillip Morris,&#x22; both of which go extreme and dark
places for laughs yet try to stay human.<br /><br />So how does it all &#x97; for the most part &#x97; ever manage to unscramble? The
performances are truly the key, but the film&#x27;s success comes down these
intimate, down-to-earth moments throughout, like when Emily calls Cal
without knowing he can see her from the backyard. These quieter moments
give the actors a chance to shine and Fogelman&#x27;s dialog has some real
bright spots too. These moments help build support for the characters,
a support and general liking that mostly doesn&#x27;t tear apart throughout
the absurd and unrealistic moments. It&#x27;s a completely wild ride between
two drastically different approaches to romance, but considering that
all the contrast and paradox only bolsters the title &#x22;Crazy, Stupid,
Love,&#x22; it has to be considered a success.<br /><br />~Steven C<br /><br />Visit my site, moviemusereviews.com!
