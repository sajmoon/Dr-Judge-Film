Crazy, stupid, love? The middle word aptly describes this ridiculous
movie. Steve Carell and the other cast members are completely unfunny
in this movie that purportedly is a comedy. The story is dreary and
implausible. Steve Carell&#x27;s character is so unbelievable that no amount
of literary license can make it plausible. When Steve Carell throws
himself out of a moving car, that sets the tone for this movie. Not
only is this movie not funny, the story is warped. It asks the audience
to accept certain premises that are not are not only untenable but
destroy whatever humor the story may contain. As a study of domestic
dysfunctionality, the movie does better job, but frankly that is not
supposed to be the theme of the story. There is nothing funny about a
man ejecting himself from a car after he learns that his wife wants a
divorce and that his life has been turned upside down. That&#x27;s tragic.
If someone is expecting an amusing movie, prepare to be disappointed.
The same can be said if you are expecting high drama. In fact, it might
be best of you wait until the movie goes to DVD land.
