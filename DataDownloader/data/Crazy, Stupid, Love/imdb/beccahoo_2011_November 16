Don&#x27;t let the title of the movie put you off like it did to me
initially!! I&#x27;d have to say that Crazy, Stupid, Love., is one of the
Cartell&#x27;s best performances. Suffice to say, you will like this movie
if you are an ex- believer or strong believer of &#x22;soul mates&#x22;. If you
have considered the idea of the existence that a soul mate exist, then
you will enjoy this film as it provides a breath of fresh air with
regards to the idea that &#x22;there&#x27;s just one person you want to be with
forever&#x22;.<br /><br />Judging by the star ratings for this movie, I&#x27;m glad to know that many
people still value the idea of soul mates. WAY TO GO YOU ROMANTIC
PEOPLE!! <br /><br />This movie encourages the emotions of the heart to be stronger than
logic of the brain. When you watch the movie, be sure to note that the
main actors are always GENUINELY INTO their partners throughout the
movie/as soon as they meet. ***Please do not go chasing a partner who
has mistreated you/used you/abused/tortured you because you deserve
better. Trust that you will find a better soul mate who is GENUINELY
INTO you as you are INTO them and then apply this movie to yourself to
make an unbreakable bond.
