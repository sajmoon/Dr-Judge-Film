Estranged Carl (Steve Carell) and Emily (Julianne Moore) sit in
uncomfortable school chairs in the silent hallway waiting for their
parent teacher conference for their eccentric son Robbie (Jonah Bobo).
Carl says, &#x22;I miss you Em.&#x22; He confesses his anger for not having the
courage to fight for her, &#x22;&#x85; because you fight for your soul mates.&#x22;
You fight for your soul mate. That is what distinguishes and touches
your heart about &#x22;Crazy, Stupid, Love&#x22;. Directors Glen Ficarra and John
Requa in tandem narrate this hysterical and poignant portrait of life. <br /><br />I did not notice that Ficarra and Requa co-helmed this voyage until the
end credits. In retrospect, this makes sense given the distinct
narrative threads that poetically intertwine. &#x22;Crazy, Stupid, Love&#x22; is
one the best movies of year. Julianne Moore is amazing, deserving of an
Oscar Nomination. Ryan Gosling as master player and Carl&#x27;s mentor,
Jacob, is awesome in his bravado and reluctant compassion. Gosling too
deserves a Supporting Nomination nod. Steve Carell is invisible in his
understatement; though his performance as Carl is all authenticity,
vulnerability, and courage. His speech at the story arc is in
character, and powerfully touches your soul. He is brilliant.<br /><br />The transparency and fluidity of &#x22;Crazy, Stupid, Love&#x22; is the genius of
Ficarra and Requa. They seamlessly envision the screenplay by Dan
Fogelman. The innate brilliance of Fogelman is that in this world,
people are smart; it&#x27;s just sometimes we all do stupid things. The most
courageous of us forgive. Carell and Moore have astounding chemistry. I
was in awe of the scene at night where Carl sneaks into his home to
garden the lawn. While their kids have ice cream in the kitchen, Emily
calls Carl&#x27;s cell in another room. She invents a washing machine
problem to ask Carl&#x27;s advice. He plays along, all the while watching Em
from the lawn. What resonates is their unspoken love. <br /><br />As &#x22;Crazy, Stupid, Love&#x22; opens we witness all too familiar Carl and
Emily having their scheduled dinner date, while the kids are left with
the babysitter Jessica (sharp and beguiling Analeigh Tipton). Out of
nowhere Em announces that she wants a divorce after 27 years. On the
drive home Em also confesses an affair with co-worker David Lindhagen
(Kevin Bacon). Bacon is awesome in his charming smugness. When Em
refuses to shut up, Carl ejects himself from the moving car. <br /><br />Back home Jessica finds herself in the midst of Carl and Emily&#x27;s
implosion. Jessica secretly is in love with the solid Carl&#x97;why she
takes the gig. Previously, to the deathly embarrassment of their son
Robbie, Jessica unexpectedly witnesses 13 year-old Robbie&#x27;s crush on
her. For Jessica, Carl is the fantasy opportunity. For Robbie, he is
perhaps alone on an island. <br /><br />Carl moves out of their home into an apartment. Clumsily and
desperately he begins frequenting a local bar. Slick handsome master
player Jacob dressed in his Dolce&#x27; suit has compassion for wallowing
Carl, whose wife slept with David Linhagen. Carl begrudgingly agrees to
a makeover and Jacob schools him in the art of getting with women. One
tip for Carl: Never talk about yourself. Amazingly sound. <br /><br />In the meantime, smart and beautiful Hannah (Emma Stone) is a law
student studying for the bar exam, with expectations of joining the
firm where she interns. More specifically, she is holding out for
marriage proposal from the firm&#x27;s deadly bland attorney Richard
(scarily boring Josh Groban). Hannah&#x27;s friend Liz advises that she can
do way better. She also warns Hannah that she has a &#x22;PG-13 love life&#x22;.
While the two are having a drink at the bar, Jacob makes a play for
Hannah. Jacob is bewitched by Hannah, partial, because she seems immune
to his charms. <br /><br />Later when Hannah&#x27;s world collapses, she tracks down Jacob to &#x22;bang&#x22;
the hot guy who hit on her. He queries, &#x22;They still say banging?&#x22; Emma
Stone is wonderful. She is naturally self-deprecating with a big heart.
When shredded Jacob takes off his shirt, Stone says, &#x22;Come on! It&#x27;s
like you&#x27;re photo-shopped!&#x22; Ryan Gosling is ripped, but that is
eclipsed by his amazing performance. He humanizes the transforming cad,
who finds his soul mate and is completely defenseless. Gosling evokes a
quiet power. When Carl tells Jacob that Hannah is too good for him, he
gazes into his drink and admits, &#x22;I know&#x85;&#x22; <br /><br />The cast all have their moments. Tipton is a surprise as Jessica. She
captures the angst of the teen growing into a woman. Marisa Tomei is
restrained comedic brilliance as Kate. Bobo as Robbie is harder to peg.
At times he seems relegated to appointed jester; however, he poignantly
reminds his Dad that you fight for your soul mate. Writer Fogelman
culturally whips everything at us, from hysterical sexting, &#x22;Twilight&#x22;
jokes, to even &#x22;Dirty Dancing&#x22;. At the end one concluding narrative
thread on the surface is humorous, and perhaps unintentionally creepy.
Probably chalk it up to the eye of the beholder. Acknowledge and
applaud Ficarra and Requa for the poignant and humorous catharsis.
&#x22;Crazy, Stupid, Love&#x22; is all about the possibility of finding and
fighting for your soul mate. Sure love can make you crazy or sometimes
do stupid things. And love is the only thing that matters.
