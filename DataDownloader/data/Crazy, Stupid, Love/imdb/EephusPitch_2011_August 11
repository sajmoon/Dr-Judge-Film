I do my best to support my neighborhood, single-screen movie theaters,
theaters such as the Vogue: they charge reduced admission for mid-week
screenings, they don&#x27;t run commercials, and they usually only make you
sit through a couple of coming attractions. So when I saw the cast for
this movie, I figured &#x22;what the heck, why not?&#x22;. I suppose maybe I need
to see more movies; this one seemed curiously under-baked to me. As I
waited for the laughs to start, I found myself pondering random
thoughts: cinematically, are noses as incompatible as Julianne Moore&#x27;s
as Steve Carrell&#x27;s indicative of doomed relationships?; is there only
the one bar in all of Los Angeles?; would the Giants line-up work
better with Orlando Cabrera batting lead-off?; and is there a chance of
my actually picking up Prince Fielder on a waiver claim in my fantasy
baseball league? It&#x27;s that kind of movie; the pace is somewhat
leisurely. There are subtle rewards: the high school girl saying &#x22;my
lips are *seal clapping*&#x22;, which provided the only laugh for me (and
made me want to listen to the Go-Go&#x27;s), and seeing John Carroll Lynch
(who I always think of as Norm Son-of-a Gunderson) in a movie is always
rewarding. But for the most part, I fear that I&#x27;ll remember this movie
as a squandering of some very estimable acting talent; it&#x27;s the only
movie I can think of that has ever made Marisa Tomei seem ridiculous.
