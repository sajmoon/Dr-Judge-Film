I was very impressed! I have always loved romantic comedies, and was
very excited to see Crazy Stupid Love when I saw the preview. Honestly,
it blew away my expectations! It was full of love, humor, tears, and so
much more! Unlike many romantic comedies, this movie had many surprises
which, many times, had the audience in the theater laughing out loud
and thinking things over in their heads! The only thing - which is not
necessarily a bad thing - is that some parts have the characteristics
of an R rated film instead of pg13. So just think it over before
bringing the little ones! But no doubt about it, Crazy Stupid Love is a
must see for everyone!!
