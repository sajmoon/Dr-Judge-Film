After seeing the trailer a million times at theaters I was looking
forward to seeing Crazy Stupid Love as it has one of my favorite actors
in it, Julianne Moore. It looked to me like a smart romantic comedy for
adults with a bit of an edge, which is exactly what it is, the story is
fresh and appeals to a broad age range, the Steve Carrell/Julianne
Moore storyline appeals to the older married demographic and the Ryan
Gosling/ Emma Stone storyline appeals to the younger hipper generation.<br /><br />Steve Carrell gives a terrific performance as the poor guy whose life
just seems to go from bad to worse, I think he will be nominated for a
golden globe or something like that, he is a very funny guy to watch no
matter what role he is in, the rest of the cast is fine also, Miss
Moore once again proves she us an actress with a spectacular, Ryan
Gosling and Emma Stone have excellent chemistry together which makes
them entirely believable as lovers, however one person steals the show
and that is Marisa Tomei in all her nutty glory, her scenes are
exceptionally funny but they are too few and far between.<br /><br />This movie does have it&#x27;s flaws, the end twist is too far fetched and
unbelievable, I think it would have been better if they gave you some
clues as to how the story all comes together in the end, the
Gosling/Stone relationship isn&#x27;t given enough time to make you really
care, and also it&#x27;s a tad too long. But other than that this is a nice,
funny and overall enjoyable film to watch.
