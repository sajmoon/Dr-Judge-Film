&#x22;Crazy Stupid Love&#x22; is nice. Possibly the perfect date movie, since it
explores relationship pitfalls without getting lost in them.<br /><br />Nice performances. Ryan Gosling plays a great &#x22;player&#x22; who decides to
take Steve Carrell&#x27;s character Cal under his wing and help him learn to
talk to women about something other than his failed marriage. And Emma
Stone is her usual delightful self.<br /><br />Entertaining, funny, and occasionally poignant. Frankly, the level of
insight isn&#x27;t much greater than some sitcoms, but it&#x27;s still sweet.<br /><br />Dating? Or, married and on a &#x22;date night&#x22;? Worth a trip to the theater.
Otherwise, perfectly worthwhile as a rental later on.
