After seeing the trailer, I knew I had to see this movie. Rarely our my
high expectation met but The Raid surpassed it. If your seeing this
movie, it&#x27;s because you want to see action and The Raid hit every mark.
The action is a mix of shootouts, hand to hand weapons, and mostly good
ol&#x27; fashioned fists.<br /><br />The Raid proves again how far behind American action films are. I&#x27;ve
seen other great foreign action films like Ong-Bak, The Protector, and
Ip man but The Raid surpasses them by highlighting a martial art style
not shown in any recent films. Its brutal and never lets up. It&#x27;s not
your typical ultra clean fighting that has been done to death but
something that looks real and desperate at times as people try to
survive outnumbered.<br /><br />Story wise it isn&#x27;t anything great but at the same time it&#x27;s better
than most martial arts films due to interesting twists and being
incredibly well paced to before you know it its over and you want more.<br /><br />If your a fan of action films, there isn&#x27;t any better out there now or
any even close in decades past.
