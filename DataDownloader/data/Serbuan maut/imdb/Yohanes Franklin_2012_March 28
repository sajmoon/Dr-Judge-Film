well i&#x27;ll just say that for an underdog movie, this is a phenomenal
job. it offers you some action of Silat and many other things that
cannot be describe with words. This movie is so worth of your time and
it is worth watching or rather a must watch action movie ! <br /><br />the sound effect is also very good, when the knife fight or gun fight
or even fist fight. it is superb. <br /><br />so don&#x27;t waste your time no more! go watch &#x22;The Raid&#x22;<br /><br />PS Better not bring your couple with you, the bloody part and the
fighting part is quite harsh but if you&#x27;ve watched saw then its fine i
guess.
