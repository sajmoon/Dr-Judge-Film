High Rating and Awards? People may be tricked for the first time
because this movie comes from a very unusual country, Indonesia. It&#x27;s
not often we see action movie comes from this country. Furthermore, the
casts also aren&#x27;t well-known at all in the world but guess what,
they&#x27;re really giving a great show in this movie. Gareth Evans, a Welsh
born writer/director/editor repeat his success creating action movie
after several years ago releasing another action movie also made in
Indonesia.<br /><br />For me, the real superstar in this movie is Rama (Iko Uwais), who was
introduced as a newbie special force in the team. Fantastic martial art
movements, which is traditional martial art called Pencak Silat from
Indonesia truly filled this movie with wowing watcher&#x27;s experience.
Fast moves, intense close combat and his knife play in combat
successfully increased my adrenalin. The best part of Iko was when He&#x27;s
about to face several people alone in a hallway. That was obviously
cool. I think Iko plays the part like Jason Statham (fighting) and
Steven Seagal (with his knife) but only better. The Raid was rained
with bloodbath. So it&#x27;s wise to avoid bringing children to watch this
movie. <br /><br />The other character that stole my attention was this man called Mad Dog
(Yayan Ruhian). In my opinion, it&#x27;ll be difficult to find this kind of
man in this world. His expression and fighting style was stunning.<br /><br />When I watch movies, I always intensely wait for the twists. The Raid
doesn&#x27;t give so many twists but it still has enough twist that improve
the story. Still this is a nicely written story. Simple idea but
creatively developed.<br /><br />At first, I thought it&#x27;ll be a one man show where Rama played the whole
part of fighting till the end. But I was wrong. The Raid gives fair
proportion to fighters in this movie. Rama isn&#x27;t the only one that
showed a great fight against the enemy in this movie. There&#x27;re the
sarge, Andi, the last cop in control room. The only thing that
disturbed me a little bit is the original dialog which is Indonesian. I
don&#x27;t know but it&#x27;s kinda awkward for me to hear the conversation in
Indonesian although it&#x27;s my native language. As I imagine, it may
sounds better in English. Never mind, it&#x27;s just me.<br /><br />With only 1.1 million spent on this action movie, surprisingly give me
such a great experience in cinema. Great movie. Great job!<br /><br />9/10
