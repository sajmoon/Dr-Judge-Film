This movie had a room or 1250 people cheering every few minutes. Non
stop excitement. I don&#x27;t think I can ever remember a movie that had so
much action from start to finish. The weapons, the fighting, the
knives, and the made up weapons, aka light bulb, propane tank keep you
riveted to the screen. I don&#x27;t think another movie like this will
appear for some time. So if you have a chance go see and you sill see
what I mean. Thank god for tiff and bringing it to us so early, and
hopefully we will have some say with regards to it getting picked up by
one of the major studios. Best to be seen in a room full of people,
hopefully non that are afraid of the sight of blood. lol
