I&#x27;d say this movie can be enjoyed mostly for those who loved to know
how to disarm tough opponents properly. The balance between the bad guy
and the good guy skills, chances to win battle in a fight nearly equal.
So you won&#x27;t see any single-strike attack to bring your opponents down,
except by a bullet.<br /><br />The fights look so real, so beautifully choreographed. And the main
actor (Iko) do have charisma in him to be a good guy. Also, the
supporting actors did their roles in very correct portions. There&#x27;s one
actor who played as the insanely tough fight-freak, Mad Dog (Yayan)
skill and fight scenes will convince you that this guy is the last guy
on earth you want to make a mess with!<br /><br />But there are still some flaws though, scenes that will seem doesn&#x27;t
make a sense to you, how actors acted to solve situation. And poor
story, lack of backgrounds/times that&#x27;s given to develop the intended
plot, especially for a betrayal intrigue, pity just make the movie
looks lil bit ridiculous to me instead.<br /><br />If you like FREAK ACTION MOVIE! you gotta see this on theater!<br /><br />7.8/10
