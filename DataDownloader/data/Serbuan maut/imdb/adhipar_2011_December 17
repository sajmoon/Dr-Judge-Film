I think other reviewers have explained the film quite detail so I only
write about the experience I get over this film.<br /><br />The background story is about a SWAT team trying to bring a ruthless
and untouchable crime lord to justice. However this film is only
focusing on a specific event in that story : THE RAID part - that turns
into a brutal, and bloody survival game. It&#x27;s become a final match or
showdown between good vs bad guys. And you should see it that way if
you want to really enjoy it.<br /><br />We don&#x27;t watch a final sport&#x27;s match, any soccer, football, MMA fight
etc looking for the plot, do we? We come because we want a great show,
excellent executions and brutal take down, and any other things that
could rush our adrenalin to the max. So forget about the plot!<br /><br />We enter the building along with the good guys. We scream, yell, jump
etc every time they score, though some bad guys are so nasty that they
also caught our attention. We are scared, worried, angry when their
luck runs out. Our heart is pounding when we know exactly or we think
they&#x27;re entering a deadly situations. We hold our breath on some very
tense moments (and this film has quite a lot of it), even feel their
pain. In the end we go home feel that we&#x27;re just attending a good.
exciting and satisfying game - which we want to see it again and again
if we can, and the good thing is, we certainly can.<br /><br />The combination of the cinematography, choreography, shot&#x27;s angles, the
original score (I&#x27;m curious how Mike Shinoda will outperform an already
good score), effects and the editing are so perfect as if you&#x27;re there.
And if you think the trailer is cool, it&#x27;s just a tip on the ocean&#x27;s
surface from an enormous iceberg below. The film itself is super-super
cool!<br /><br />100 mins flies so fast and when the credit rolls, I still sit there,
thinking if I could catch the next show - which sadly impossible
because the ticket has sold out in minutes, several days before.<br /><br />Of course, The Raid is not without flaws. The acting, the dialogs, the
CGI, the twist - you know - those usual unconvincing stuff which you
can find even in some blockbuster martial arts/action movies, can be
improved. But overall it is a superb action movie so I understand the
high-praised comments from those film festivals.<br /><br />Now, you may wonder why I compare it to Star Wars. Back then, when I
first saw Star Wars, I was very amazed not by the story, plots or the
acting, but by the cinematography, special effects, the laser saber
duel, the sound effects, the robots, all those hi-tech stuff which are
so an eye opener that we have no choice to compare the next sci-fi
movies with it.<br /><br />The Raid does the same thing for action genre. And I will be waiting
eagerly for the sequels or even the prequels just like Star Wars.<br /><br />This film is best seen with your group of friends who enjoy hardcore
and bloody fights, so you can cheer, scream, yell, sigh together and
talk about it (and probably count how many ways to die/kill people in
this film) on the way home. Go to toilet before the shows so you don&#x27;t
miss any scenes. Snacks and drinks could be considered as &#x27;nice to
have&#x27; items. I was seating on the edge of my seat and my eyes were
glued to the screen almost all the time that I only sip my drink once
in the first 10 minutes and haven&#x27;t touch my snack until the credit
rolls.<br /><br />9.5 out of 10! Sorry for my English.
