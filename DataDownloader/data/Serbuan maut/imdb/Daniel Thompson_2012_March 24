I decided to wait a full day before writing a critical review on this
movie to let my emotions die down - In conclusion i have nothing but
praise for this movie. <br /><br />If your goal is to walk into this movie and be psychologically
challenged or expect great dialogue you will be disappointed. There are
some movies that you need to walk into and know little of what will
unfold to get the full cinematic experience. I always check the ratings
of movies on IMDb before considering watching them and after reading
some of the other user reviews on &#x27;high octane&#x27; intensity and non stop
fight scenes i in the least expected some good action in this movie.
Even with that though i thought an entire movie could not be based on
fighting scenes and score above an 8 on IMDb (boy was i wrong).<br /><br />This movie is earning glowing reviews because of the action sequences
filmed in the movie that place you in a cinematic experience where you
actually feel like you are watching real men fight for their lives.
It&#x27;s nothing poetic with backflips and flexible positions but simply
man vs man often equipping anything in the room to disarm/disable and
kill their opponent. It places you in the hot seat viewing the closest
things to actual killings - Now this isn&#x27;t to say the movie slows down
on blood spurts or zooms in when someone is getting their throat sliced
- it simply shows it how it is, it&#x27;s fast, real and intense.<br /><br />In some of the other reviews you hear fans praising the knife fighting
scenes. This movie was incredible with it&#x27;s knife fights and how
effective and swift they are in close quarters. The finish was always
swiftly at the throat but that wasn&#x27;t before 2 to 3 lightning touches
to the chest/quads or arms to disable an opponent or render them
shocked in pain.<br /><br />Heres the bottom line: This movie was made on the smallest budget i&#x27;ve
ever seen for any movie to hit international screens. The director and
all actors are no names that you have never heard however i guarantee
that you will never watch another action film again because the raid is
groundbreaking in it&#x27;s reality/intensity and quality of choreography.<br /><br />Every movie that scores high ratings appeals to a certain group of
audiences. This is a very specific movie but is well deserving of the
praise it is receiving from our users at IMDb. It is my hope to see
more of this action from the director and actors cause i honestly don&#x27;t
think i can ever watch a fighting movie again. <br /><br />MUST WATCH 10/10 Excellent.
