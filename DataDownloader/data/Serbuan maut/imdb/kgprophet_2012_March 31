Increasingly now, foreign filmmakers are making better Hollywood action
movies than Hollywood is. In this case an English director who
evidently now works in Indonesia seems to have mastered all the action
story tenets despite this being only his 3rd feature film. Even more,
the number of layers to this story parallels the number of floors in
the apartment building that is at the centre of this film. All I could
think of is how Hollywood will eventually commandeer this film and make
a lifeless by-the-numbers knock-off that will only stain the original.
And of course, the budget of the original is about the same as a
Hollywood B-list movie actor&#x27;s salary.<br /><br />This films is a disciple of the Asian extreme action genre, with
over-the-top karate and acrobatics mixed with guns and violence.
Betrayal isn&#x27;t just a plot twist in these films, it&#x27;s the first act. At
least 5 or 6 betrayals are expected in these type of films where
thieves betray other thieves, cops betray other cops, and honest guys
get betrayed by best friends. What makes this film a standout is the
unflinching action and well choreographed fight sequences by leads
Yayan Ruhian and Iko Uwais. Early Jackie Chan movies got this kind of
notice overseas because of their energy and gifted action instincts.
Here, Gareth Evans is a one man powerhouse writer, director, and
editor, masterminding this intricate chess match of good guys trapped
on the sixth floor, with angry thugs coming up from the fifth floor and
determined killers descending from the seventh floor. You feel our
heroes feel trapped and vulnerable. Evans finds sources of tension from
many places. The apartment building has tenants with unknown loyalties.
The man heading the raid has unknown motives. Each character is well
established with a minimum amount of screen time, keeping the action
going.<br /><br />I was urged by a movie reviewer to see this film, describing it as one
of the best action movies ever made. And you have to agree, this film,
after providing a few minutes of backstory, takes off straight into the
police raid of the apartment building filled with bad guys and a gang
lord. Cinematography takes lessons from &#x22;Saving Private Ryan&#x22;, using
hand-held documentary style footage during firefights, and blasting the
soundtrack with dozens of loud guns firing at once. The pulsing
synthesiser score also hits with the punchy music stabs that propel the
momentum as the police troops make their way up to the big bad guy on
the top floor.<br /><br />Action sequences are creative and provide new angles and fight tactics
that keep the hand-to-hand combat kinetic. Fans of the Bourne movies
are encouraged to seek this out. (Not a coincidence that a Bourne
Legacy trailer played before this showing). Many human moments also
ground this film. An innocent man caught in the crossfire, gets asked
to risk his life. A police squad leader who gets frustrated when the
man conducting the raid puts his troops at risk. A child hired as
lookout for the gang lord must die in order to prevent him from
sounding the alarm.<br /><br />There is an intensity to this film that resembles scenes from &#x22;Black
Hawk Down&#x22;, with very intelligent setups for conflict, and innovative
approaches to getting from point A to point B. This fresh drive,
propelled by good guy Iko Uwais makes this 1 hour 40 minute film zip
along with no time out to catch your breath. The fact this film is
subtitled will prevent it from being a widespread hit, although it will
no doubt have a long life on DVD. Instead, I expect director Gareth
Evans to be directing movies with 150 times the budget of this small
gem within a very short time.
