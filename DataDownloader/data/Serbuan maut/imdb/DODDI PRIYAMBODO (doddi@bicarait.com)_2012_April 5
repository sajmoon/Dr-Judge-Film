It is DANGEROUS! <br /><br />Watching this Movie make your Heart Stop for a while! Non Stop thrill
from the Beginning until the End. It will make your Body Hurts,
especially your heart. Coz the sound of this movie really want to kill
you! (and believe me that the fight and shooting scene will definitely
make your mind blow away...)<br /><br />Well, you call me an Old Fashioned guy because I always like a martial
art with hand style from years such as Ong Bak, Jet Lee or Jackie Chan
movies. So, you can definitely believe what I am saying about this
Review, because I am a very Big Fan of Action Movies. <br /><br />Maybe it is also too early to say this because the Director and the
Player (G. Evans and Iko Uwais) only play 2 big movies until now.
Comparable to Jet Lee or Jackie Chan who has spend so many years doing
their movies. But, I am very sure.. That Iko Uwais is better than those
two persons :)<br /><br />Trust Me... You Won&#x27;t Regret watching this Movie.... It will KILL YOU!
Your Body will SUFFER! Coz It&#x27;s Damn Good!<br /><br />Finally : The Best ACTION, THRILLER MOVIE that I ever Watched! --&#x3E;
10/10
