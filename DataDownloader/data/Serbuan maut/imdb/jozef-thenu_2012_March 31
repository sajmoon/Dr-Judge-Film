First of all, I have to say the rating of 8.4 is a result of hyped out
Indonesian doing the vote. It&#x27;s a 6 in IMDb, 7 at most, but never an 8. <br /><br />What&#x27;s wrong with the movie? well for one it creates a lot of questions
when you watch the movie where you can&#x27;t help to go &#x22;hey wait a minute&#x22;
before the movie tries to make you forget about it by giving you a
fighting scene. Because that&#x27;s what &#x27;The Raid&#x27; is; a cut up fighting
scene stitched by what appears to be an attempt to create drama. <br /><br />It&#x27;s a story about a SWAT team that goes to an apartment to capture the
kingpin that lurks on the top floor while slowly removing the tenants
that happened to be armed and dangerous. Now, it has very terrific
fighting scene and it&#x27;s very well choreographed; in fact too well
choreographed that it loses a sense of realism and is more similar to
an 80s kungfu movie. <br /><br />These exact fighting scenes that leaves small room for character
development, but tragically is poorly used. My only praise goes to Ray
Sahetapy who plays the bad guy for being able to be in character and
being taken seriously instead of the lead player who somehow makes
people smirk when he talks his line. <br /><br />I know I have to somehow accept that the lead actor is there because he
has martial arts skill but I couldn&#x27;t help the feeling that the whole
movie is highly influenced to accommodate these &#x27;great&#x27; fighting scene.
Example; for the setting of an apartment that&#x27;s full of drug addicts
and thugs, the room sure is big (5x5m) Which really makes you wonder
why on earth would they have room those big if not to accommodate the
movie equipment to shoot all the fighting going on in that room. <br /><br />As an Indonesian I accept the coming of &#x27;The Raid&#x27; as a breath of fresh
air to the movie industry that is currently filled with half soft-porn
half horror flick. BUT, I couldn&#x27;t help feeling that most Indonesian
are taking this movie waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyy out of proportion. <br /><br />My two cents is this; besides the language used in the movie, this
movie has nothing to do with Indonesia. It&#x27;s not based on reality in
Indonesia, It doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s in Indonesia, It doesn&#x27;t represent
anything Indonesia! At least in Ong Bak you could feel that this is a
Thailand cinematic work of art. <br /><br />If you want to watch the raid, you can expect a great fighting scene;
some that&#x27;s even medically impossible but to expect a movie per se,
don&#x27;t let the 8.4 fools you.
