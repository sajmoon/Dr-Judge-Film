My number one list action movie is The Matrix because it balanced the
depth of the story with the action. Somewhere among the top list, there
was also The Dark Knight for the same reason. However, when speaking
only &#x27;action&#x27;, I used to choose a Hongkong movie, Flashpoint, starred
by Donnie Yen. Before Flashpoint, I&#x27;ll choose a Thailand movie, Ong Bak
which launched Tony Jaa career internationally. Now, when I speak an
action movie that speak for the action, I will choose an Indonesia
movie, &#x27;THE RAID&#x27;, choreographed by Iko Uwais and Yayan Ruhiyan and
starred by them.<br /><br />The problem with Donnie Yen&#x27;s Flashpoint was you need to wait about one
hour and fifteen minutes to get the action really start but when it
started, it was really worth to wait. The fight between Donnie Yen and
Collin Chou, inspired by MMA especially BJJ was so well choreographed
and made audience hold their breath and asking &#x22;are this sh*t a real
thing?&#x22;. In Evans&#x27; latest, THE RAID, you won&#x27;t need those one hour and
fifteen minutes because he already made the audience gasps in the first
fifteen minutes.<br /><br />I wouldn&#x27;t say a thing about Ong Bak because in my opinion, Merantau
was more superior than Ong Bak. The problem with Merantau was Gareth
was trying to bring audience to understand the culture of Silat first
because showing the full action.You can said, Merantau was like
Yamakasi doing for parkour while The Raid was the B-13 of silat.<br /><br />It is useless to review this movie from the plot because there wasn&#x27;t
any significant plot. The plot was made only to bridge between one
action scene to other action scene. But d*mn! Even with the weak dialog
and clich&#xE9; plot, Gareth executed it well so we, the audience, didn&#x27;t
have time to analyze this or that. What we know, we were flooded by
f*cking awesome action movies from infiltration scene, massacre scene,
and of course, martial art scenes when the characters have run out of
bullets.<br /><br />I remember when one of Merantau review said Merantau was Ong Bak when
handled professionally. The same can be said with THE RAID. The Raid
was Flashpoint with larger actions and handled professionally from the
music, cinematography, and even the visual effect.<br /><br />The music composed by Aria Prayogi and Fajar Yuskemal was like a
combination between Hans Zimmer&#x27;s Joker theme and Rage Against The
Machine. It brought the audience immediately to the brutal tone of the
movie. In some scenes, those music suddenly disappeared, leaving
uneasiness to the audience. I wonder how Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park
will interpret the scene to his score because Prayogi and Yuskemal
score was perfect for the tone of this movie and it was really
different with any Linkin Park score.<br /><br />The sound effect, oh my, I hardly believe this is Indonesian movie.
Even Hongkong movies are rarely have this good sound effect, You can
differentiate between the bullet shot next to you to the bullet shot
from the next room, The sound of knife slashing was so beautiful to
listen and combined by the beautiful art of Silat, the scene was a
masterpiece of a brutal dance of angel of death.<br /><br />THE RAID has little visual effect but when they did, it was done
amazingly and effectively. Frankly, prior to watch this movie, I was a
little bit disappointed when I heard there will be slow-motion scene in
the movie. However, Gareth proved me wrong. He was not Zack Snyder. The
slow-motion was done only in one scene and perfectly executed which I
hardly imagined how it should be done in other way.<br /><br />Matt Flanery and Dimas Subhono as DOP played camera creatively and yet
it captured all the motion perfectly. In fact, some scenes was like a
scene taken from art movie due to their creative angle but it didn&#x27;t
reduce the brutal tone of the movie, didn&#x27;t make the impact of every
punch and kick weaker, in fact, in some scenes, it enhanced the &#x22;BAM!&#x22;
factor.<br /><br />The choreography was the factor which made this movie popular. I have
said previously that even the fight scene between Donnie Yen and Collin
Chou in Flashpoint had been surpassed by almost every fight scene in
the movie. In Merantau, Gareth didn&#x27;t want to show the brutal image of
silat due to the main character of that movie was a naive and kind
young man from village. In this movie, the characters are cops and bad
guy, so either be killed or kill. Both Iko and Yayan have choreographed
it so well so even one reviewer said &#x22;I didn&#x27;t know there was so many
ways to kill people until I saw this movie&#x22; and he was right. Jeff
Imada (Bourne Identity) and Yuen Woo Ping will recognize these people
from Indonesia and you&#x27;ll probably hear about them in coming years
among the top list of fight choreographer.<br /><br />After watching this movie, I found myself lost my appetite to other
action movies. For me, other action movies was a snack before I can
watch the next Gareth Evans project, BERANDAL.<br /><br />- Kunderemp -
