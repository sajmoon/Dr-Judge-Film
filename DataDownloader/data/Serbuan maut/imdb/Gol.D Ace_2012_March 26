The Raid offers you intense non-stop full action and awesome stylish
martial arts choreography featuring extreme relentless bloody violence. <br /><br />You wouldn&#x27;t found any significant plot here, in other words there&#x27;s
nothing to tell about the storyline. Once you have decided to watch
this movie, leave your brain outside the cinema&#x27;s door and enjoy the
fighting.<br /><br />Probably, not everyone will enjoy scene-by-scene fightings without
essential supporting storyline -which is, probably The Raid was never
designed to provide that since the beginning-. What I can say, this
kind of movie perhaps has its own specific audiences. If you are
amongst of them, you should RATE The Raid with 9 AT THE LEAST!!<br /><br />To think again, Gareth Evans, the director probably wants us to leave
our brain outside the cinema&#x27;s door, don&#x27;t analyze anything, don&#x27;t ask
what&#x27;s behind the story, just enjoy the non-stop actions and The Raid
will make you hold your breath for more than 60 minutes!!!<br /><br />I am, exactly, not amongst of those. I&#x27;m an audience who enjoy the
balanced action movie, deep storyline and strong action. But once I
know what kind of movie The Raid is, as I said, I set my expectation,
change my perspective, therefore I enjoyed watching the movie whilst
holding my breath on!! :D
