This movie has got to be the greatest work of matt stone and trey parker
ever. It is always great seeing those two be as funny as hell. I caught
this
movie one night on HBO and i watch it every time i see it on TV. Its a
great
movie and should have been seen by more people. I recommend it to anyone
lookin for a laugh. 8/10
