Orgazmo is the kind of movie that is cheesy to the point that it's
obviously
meant to be that way. You can't watch a movie like this and think even for
a
second that it is meant to be taken seriously, or even that it takes
itself
seriously. And all of this is clear just from looking at the cover box, so
you know from the minute that you pick the movie up that you are about to
watch an extremely goofball comedy. With that in mind, you can really
appreciate Orgazmo for what it is.<br /><br />Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the famous creators of South Park and the
hilarious BASEketball, have returned with another comedy, this one with
much
less taste but at least as many laughs. Orgazmo is the story of a Mormon
missionary who inadvertently winds up starring in an adult film in Los
Angeles, but who never seems to lose his faith. Trey Parker plays Elder
Young, the above-mentioned missionary, and also writes and directs this
unusually amusing b-movie.<br /><br />Orgazmo is a straightforward film that has a very obvious intent. It is
aimed at the same audience as other infinitely inferior movies like Scary
Movie and Scary Movie 2, but it actually succeeds because its creators
have
some filmmaking talent that goes beyond a simple purge of every disgusting
joke that they learned in fourth grade. Parker and Stone are just
naturally
funny guys, as has become obvious by now, which is why they have managed
to
take the potential-free combination of the porn industry and a tiny budget
and make it into a hilarious comedy.<br /><br />Trey Parker plays Elder Young, a missionary assigned to do his mission
work
in Hollywood, and in a hilarious run-in with porn director Max Orbison, he
ends up defending himself against a gang of thugs and thereby earning a
high
paying position as the leading man in Orbison's newest porno. Seduced by
the
offer of a huge amount of money, which he plans to spend on a house for
himself and his ridiculous girlfriend (`Jesus and I love you!'), Young
agrees to take on the role, provided he doesn't have to do any actual
intercourse. Sound like the makings for a great comedy? No? Exactly!
That's
what makes it so good! This material is total crap, but that's where the
comedy comes from! This is a spoof of lots of different types of films,
not
the least of which are martial arts films, for reasons which you'll just
have to watch the movie to see, and it succeeds on many different levels.<br /><br />The characters are hilarious (there is a truly classic moment when Choda
Boy
explains to Young that, believe it or not, he doesn't get a lot of action
from women. The fact that he's strapping a dildo to the top of his head
might have something to do with that.), and there are just some great
scenes. The movie is aware of its place, and it doesn't try to pretend
that
it is something that it's not. Get a bunch of your buddies together and
have
a couple beers while you watch this movie, you'll love it.
