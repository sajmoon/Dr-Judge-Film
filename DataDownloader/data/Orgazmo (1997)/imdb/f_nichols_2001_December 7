I'm sure, if your a Trey Parker fan and have read the other reviews, then
you should be confident that this is a very funny movie.  Despite the fact
that it is based around the porn industry, it is light-hearted and about
1/8
as offensive as your average SouthPark episode. However, the morons of the
MPAA decided to give it an NC-17 rating, destroying the chance of a theatre
release and keeping it off movie rental racks. At the same time they
greenlighted the R-rating of Scary Movie, which I don't necessarily
disagree
with, but in retrospect Orgazmo does not come close the that kind of
offensive and disgusting humor.  Don't get me wrong, I love that kind of
humor, it is just too bad the MPAA is too blind to see the hypocrisy of
their actions.  It would be a great day in cinema history if the rating
system was destroyed.  It is no longer a matter of making a movie and
receiving a rating. It is now, making a movie based around the idea of
receiving a certain rating, to increase profit margins, and ever
compromising the artistic vision.  This is a disgusting trend that will be
perpetuated by future compromise and degrade the quality of films that we
can actually see in the theatre.
