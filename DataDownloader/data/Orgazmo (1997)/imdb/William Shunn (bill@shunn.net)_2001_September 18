This movie certainly made me laugh -- me and the three other people in the
theater -- but it wasn't nearly as funny as it could have been.  The humor
in the movie is lopsided because while Trey Parker seems to know quite a
bit
about the porn industry, he doesn't know bean about Mormons.<br /><br />For a movie to be truly successful as a comedy of two value systems in
conflict, it needs to thoroughly understand both.  I spent two years as a
Mormon missionary, and everything about the depiction of the missionaries
in
this movie was off the mark.  Mormon missionaries spend 24 hours a day
with
their assigned companions; they do not live alone in separate apartments.
Mormons use no iconography in their worship; Elder Young in this movie is
portrayed praying to a Catholic-style icon.  And Mormons don't have to
fork
over a lump sum of $20,000 in order to get married in the temple; they
simply have to being paying ten percent of their current income as
tithing.
And missionaries have no income.<br /><br />I don't object to Trey Parker's missionary becoming a porn star.  That's
the
comic conceit of the movie, and the situation that brings the two value
systems into collision.  But I do think it was careless of Parker to use a
Mormon as the centerpiece of the movie if they don't care to get the
specifics of that peculiar religion correct.  A Catholic would have served
as well in this context, or even a generic Christian.  To use a Mormon and
not use him well is to weaken the strength of the movie's satire.  If only
Parker had done as much research on Mormonism as he has obviously done on
porn.<br /><br />But then again, maybe a porn star viewing this movie would say just the
opposite.<br /><br />In short, &quot;Orgazmo&quot; is a pleasant enough diversion if you don't know
anything about Mormons.
