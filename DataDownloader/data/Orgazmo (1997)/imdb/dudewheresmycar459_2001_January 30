Very, very funny movie. Another hit for Trey Parker. He has a very good
nac
for filmmaking. The dialogue and plot is just excellent in this movie. I
was
very surprised that there wasn't more nudity, because, as you know, Trey
Parker can be very crude. VERY CRUDE! Didn't really need the NC-17 rating,
but I think it got it for all the uses of male &amp; female genitals.<br /><br />Final Grade:10/10 A+
