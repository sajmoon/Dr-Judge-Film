Personally, I'm a huge fan of 80's comedies, why? Because they were raw,
uncut and downright funny. I think Orgazmo and Trey Parker's sense of
humour
follows this basic track and i love it. It's crude, yet funny, it's
downright sick and of course i love it! How can you not? &quot;Bring back 80's
comedies!!&quot;<br /><br />Enjoy...
