The strange tale of a Mormon on mission getting pulled into the adult
film industry makes for the most hilarious movie ever! There are many
clever one-liners, &quot;I don&#39;t mean to sound like a queer or anything...&quot;
makes for a very funny running gag. I usually do not enjoy stupid
comedies, but this one keeps me laughing throughout the whole movie.
Trey Parker and Matt Stone truly created a winner with this one. Trey
Parker is incredibly convincing as Joe, the innocent Mormon. Matt Stone
portrays the comic relief in the camera guy role. There are also
appearances by other famous stars, such as Ron Jeremy. Baseketball was
a great movie, but it pales in comparison to Orgazmo. For anyone with a
perverted sense of humor, Orgazmo is a must see!
