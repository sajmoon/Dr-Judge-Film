1998_October 23 

The movie relies too much on the passive, intrinsic humor in things (dildos,
Mormons, the look on people's faces when they orgasm, the allure of Ron
Jeremy), but doesn't build on this humor at all.  There's far too much
waiting between funny parts (e.g., long drawn-out fighting
scenes).<br /><br />Watch a Southpark repeat.  There will be more meat in it.
