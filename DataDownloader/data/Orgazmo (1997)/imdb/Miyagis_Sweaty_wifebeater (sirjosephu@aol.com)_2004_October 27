Orgazmo (1997) was the second live action feature film from the South
Park duo. Following Cannibal: The Musical, the duo of Trey Parker and
Matt Stone satire the world of &quot;Adult Entertainment&quot;.<br /><br />The story follows the exploits of a Mormon missionary named Joe (Trey
Parker) who by accident becomes the industry's biggest star &quot;Orgazmo&quot;.
A sleazy producer makes Trey an unwilling indentured servant. Joe's
life is also plagued by his religious devotion to the mother church and
his fianc&eacute;e. Can Joe resolves these problems by the movie's end? Matt
Stone co-stars as a set still photographer. Dian Bachar also co-stars
as Orgazmo's sidekick and friend Choda Boy. Lloyd Kaufmann (founder of
Troma Studios) and many stars of the &quot;Adult Entertainment&quot; make cameo
appearances as well.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie. It was real funny and highly entertaining. Trey
Parker did a great job of writing and directing this movie. The movie
is even better if you're familiar with the porn business or know some
of the stars. Too bad this movie was barely released and it seems to
have been forgotten about on video. If you love South Park or enjoyed
Cannibal: The Musical then I advise you to pick up a copy of this
movie. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
