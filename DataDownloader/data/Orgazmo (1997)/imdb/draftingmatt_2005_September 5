OK, I am a non-Mormon resident of Utah and this movie was absolutely
retarded. I am tired of people thinking Utah is some state out of
mainstream America and this movie takes that to the EXTREME! First off,
I know a lot about the Mormon faith and this movie is incorrect in
every aspect they represent them. Again, I am not a Mormon and honestly
I don't really understand that weird religion myself, but this takes
stereo types to the extreme and was absolutely stupid! There were some
funny parts to the movie. I loved when the old lady in the walker was
shot! I guess a lot of people find humor in that sort of thing. I
admit, I sometimes am one of them. Overall I would give this movie a 3
out of 10 because there were some funny parts, but I would not
recommend spending the money to rent this movie.
