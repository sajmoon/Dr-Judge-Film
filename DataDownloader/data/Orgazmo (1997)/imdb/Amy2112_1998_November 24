It's such a shame Matt and Trey are so unappreciated. Oh sure, little 10 year
old boys wander around saying &quot;I'm not fat, I'm big boned,&quot; but it's amazing
how few people get the thought that goes into their humor...and Orgazmo is a
prime example. For Orgazmo to make fun of pornos, kung fu films, and Mormons
(among other things) in such a seamless, effortless way actually takes a lot
of intelligence on their part.
