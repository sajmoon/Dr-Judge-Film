Sometimes I just need brain candy.  When I need brain candy, I can rely on
Matt Stone and Trey Parker to deliver.<br /><br />Orgazmo is full of potty humour, blasphemy, and other rudeness.  It
relentlessly mocks  religious zealots, the porn industry, and nearly
everything in between.<br /><br />There is nothing good about the acting or production qualities -- in fact,
the *poor* acting and production qualities add to the humour, I think, in
the same way that the cheesy attempt at animation adds to the humour of
South Park.  The entertainment value of 'Orgazmo' lies primarily in the
situation -- and even if the individual jokes are not fantastically
original, the situation *is*.  It's just good, stupid fun.<br /><br />Think of the rudest, raunchiest of all the South Park episodes -- like the
one where Cartman joins NAMBLA, or the one where the kids start a fad of
sexually stimulating dogs.  If you enjoyed those, you will probably enjoy
Orgazmo.  If you didn't appreciate the humour or found them offensive, don't
bother with this movie.<br /><br />Personally, my tastes are so base that I consider this one of the funniest
comedies I've ever seen.
