Orgazmo, not to be confused with the 69 suspense flick Orgasmo...If you
found a copy of this movie (good luck), watch the first hour then go do the
dishes or blow dry your hair.  I'm a big Trey and Matt fan but this one
really blows. Humor is sub-par for the first half then pretty much
disappears completely.   Too bad as it was a great idea for a comedy, a
Mormon becomes Porn Star/Super Hero, how could it go wrong???  Written and
directed by Trey Parker and an uncredited Matt Stone (lucky b******d), who
also appears only slightly in the film. I didn't even realize it was him the
first couple of times I saw him and his only lines consist of a running gag
&quot;I don't want to sound gay but....&quot;. (about the only part I laughed at) Best
thing I can suggest is to run right out to your local vid store and ask for
a copy of Basketball.  If you insist on watching this movie then keep your
expectations down and remember this is their first attempt.<br /><br />
