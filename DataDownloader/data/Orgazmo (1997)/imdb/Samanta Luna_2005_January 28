I didn't knew it would be that fun!!! Even if other people thought it
was just another dumb movie,I just loved it ,from the beginning to the
end.<br /><br />The plot was very very good,the acting was more than OK (Come on,the
hole cast was funny! and they didn't lose the idea of the film),it had
some of the most original characters and quotes ,Like Joe young,Dave
the Lighting Guy, everything that he said was hilarious and Choda boy.
And I,specially ,liked Ron Jeremy's part,it was good and competent.<br /><br />Finally ,I have to say that Matt Stone and Trey parker (Two of the best
comedians and Director in the world) made a great job,Their direction,
writing and acting was the best that I've seen in a long time.
