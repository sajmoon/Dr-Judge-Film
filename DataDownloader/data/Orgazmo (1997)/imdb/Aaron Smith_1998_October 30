Being from Utah we are used to seeing the Morman culture at its fullest
effect.  This movie was really unrealistic as it goes for the Missionary
aspect. Not just because he becomes a porn star, but because he wouldn't
have that much free time.  And what ever happened to his
companion.<br /><br />Of course what do I know, I'm not Morman!!
