1999_September 21 

I really cannot believe how many comments of praise there are for this piece
of low-budget, low-brow tripe.  First off you can spot the &quot;jokes&quot; coming a
mile away e.g. the old lady's response when she answered the door to the 2
mormons.  I also cannot believe everyone being up in arms about the NC-17
rating (equiv, to a UK 18), the movie is crammed full of sexually explicit
language, dildos etc.  even with a lower certificate I would find it hard to
see this movie raking in a bigger box-office.  I did not find this movie
offensive in the slightest, but it is an adult film and should be shown to
an adult audience.  When will people realise that Stone &amp; Parker's talents
are limited and see this awful movie for what it is.
