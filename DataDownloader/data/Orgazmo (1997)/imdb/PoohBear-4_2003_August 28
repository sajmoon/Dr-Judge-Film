This movie is funny, if you look at it as a porno spoof made in the same
way
most pornos are made.  It also has many good porno stars, of which I only
recognized a few.  I do not watch those types of movies.  Trey Parker and
Matt Stone did a great job, and I am glad something like this was made.
Maybe Kevin Smith saw this movie, and it helped him make Dogma as great
of a
movie as it is.  We have Mormons spoofed here, and Catholics spoofed in
Dogma, what's the next religion we can spoof?<br /><br />Life is meant to have fun and enjoy.  Trey and Matt are great at allowing
us
to do this.
