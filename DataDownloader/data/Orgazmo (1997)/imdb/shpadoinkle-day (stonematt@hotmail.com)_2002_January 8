Orgazmo is the best thing trey parker has done outside of his work on
South
Park.<br /><br />Trey Parker takes the lead role of &quot;Joe Young&quot;, with Dain Bachar as his
sidekick &quot;Ben/ Chowda Boy&quot;. Parker's real life sidekick Matt Stone play
the
part of &quot;Dave&quot;, who runs away with most of the shots he's
in.<br /><br />Even in a smaller role, Matt &amp; Trey gel together well.  You can see that
they have a buddy-buddy think going on.<br /><br />If you're a Trey / Stone fan, then you'll enjoy this film.  If you're not,
see it anyway, what harm can it do?
