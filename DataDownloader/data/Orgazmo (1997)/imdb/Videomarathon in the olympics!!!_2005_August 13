I saw the movie &quot;BASEketball&quot; and laughed and laughed...<br /><br />Then I saw &quot;South Park the Movie&quot; and &quot;Team America&quot; and laughed...<br /><br />Then I saw &quot;Orgazmo&quot;. I think I coughed sometime during? <br /><br />I like the team behind these movies, but anyone not embarrassed over
having seen this, can never be a friend of mine.<br /><br />Use your imagination to see a man with a rubber dick on his head. If
you laugh hysterically at that, then see this one. Everyone else,
instead of seeing it, write a letter to your local Blockbuster
demanding they remove this crap from their shelves. 90 min better spent
and the stamp is cheaper than the rent fee.
