&quot;Orgazmo&quot; had me laughing, often. Most people will most definitely not enjoy
this,and you know who you are. Like &quot;South Park&quot; it's crude,crass and base,
but JUST funny enough to sit though. <br /><br />Granted,&quot;Orgazmo&quot; DOES wear thin in the last half-hour. ( Seems typical for
most movies these days, especially comedies) There's just so many hairy
buttock shots and smarmy talk one can stomach. It's gets a bit too serious
as well. <br /><br />But that theme song at the beginning! Hillarious. ( Pretend your're fifteen,
you'll enjoy it more.)<br /><br />Now the question remains...Are Trey Parker and Matt Stone 51% brilliant
social satirists and 49% trailer trash? Or the other way
arround?<br /><br />Either way they're making more money than me.<br /><br />
