Oh how I have sought this movie, based on word-of-mouth and my respect
for the Trey-Parker duo... I&#39;ve looked around in eBay for VHS copies,
then decided to wait for the DVD to enjoy it better... And what a big
disappointment at the end -- this is quite possible one of the worst
movies I have watched ever. I&#39;ve spent every minute of it telling
myself: &quot;Wait, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll show their brilliance in the next scene
-- don&#39;t give up!&quot; Ended up wasting two hours of my life... Don&#39;t even
bother to seek this out of curiosity - it&#39;s moronic attempt at humor.
The worst episode of South Park is better than this movie.<br /><br />The storyline revolves around a young Mormon missionary named Joe Young
(Trey Parker) knocking on the door of a house in Los Angeles where
they&#39;re trying to make an adult movie with a super-hero plot (&quot;Orgasmo&quot;
of the title). The director sends his thugs to kick Joe&#39;s ass for
disrupting the movie, and in the act of defending himself Joe shines on
the director&#39;s eyes as the man that can play the title character. It&#39;s
all downhill from there...
