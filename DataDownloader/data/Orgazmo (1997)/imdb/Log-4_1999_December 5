1999_December 5 

Trey Parker (and Matt Stone) again stay true to their brand of humor.  No
holds barred, nothing is sacred.  I myself find this hilarious but some
will
miss the point and be offended and hey that is your right.  What is the
point you may ask?  Well I think it is to prove that anything and
everything
can be made fun of.  This movie is for people with an open sense of humor.
If that is you then enjoy...
