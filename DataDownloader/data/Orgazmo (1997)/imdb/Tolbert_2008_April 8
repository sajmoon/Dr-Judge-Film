This one is now in my top 5 for dark comedies. The top two spots would
have to be Kingpin and Dodgeball. It&#39;s difficult to even classify this
as a &quot;dark&quot; comedy though as it really is in a class of it&#39;s own. I&#39;m
not really a South Park fan but Trey Parker is a funny guy. I literally
just about fell over laughing at some of the scenes in this movie. Ther
is some unbeatable material here. Chances are most hard-core Mormons
won&#39;t like this one too well due to the jabs toward their religion.
That said however, it&#39;s pretty tongue-and-cheek stuff.<br /><br />Orgazmo as a character, Choda Boy as a character, they play off of each
other so well. The sequences with Ron Jeremy are pretty funny too. I
recommend this one very highly, just put the kids to bed before you
queue it up!
