Matt Stone and Trey Parker make great movies. Orgazmo is no exception.
Tying
in a Mormon with the porn industry is not only original, it's hilarious.
Matt Stone's cameos as &quot;Dave the Lighting Guy&quot; get progressively funnier
throughout the movie. This is a must see for any serious comedy fans,
especially those who enjoy Matt Stone and Trey Parker's style of humor.
