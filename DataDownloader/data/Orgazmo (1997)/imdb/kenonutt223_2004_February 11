I'm actually a mormonist.  I go to the mormon church on Sunday Mornings,
and
I like reading the Book of mormon, along with the Doctrine and covenants
and
Pearl of Great price.  I'm classed as an anti-christ member.  BUT, My
mormonism did not turn into orgasm, just like the mormon characters did in
that film (:o).<br /><br />William Pryor.
