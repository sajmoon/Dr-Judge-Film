perfect for fans of south park.<br /><br />this movie is really funny and never slows.   it has a good mix of humor
from smart to goofy - a bit of a &quot;Naked Gun&quot; style here and
there.<br /><br />hey, can someone explain why this got a NC-17 rating from the MPAA?
there's
a bit of language and non-threatening violence but that's about it.
there's
about 2 seconds of nudity.<br /><br />i dunno, just go rent it.<br /><br />p.s.
g-fresh is in the hizouse
