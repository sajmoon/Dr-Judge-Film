Joe Young (Trey Parker) is a devout Mormon visiting Los Angeles working
to spread his words for the love of Jesus. While seeing the
unenlightened door to door, Joe is offered $20,000 to play Captain
Orgazmo in the new director's porn film (Micheal Dean Jocobs). Joe is
mindful of the financial burdens of his upcoming wedding. Since Joe is
doing this for his cute fianc&eacute; (Robyn Lynee), Joe accepts his role as
Captain Orgazmo but not knowing what he's in for! <br /><br />Written &amp; Directed by Trey Parker (Cannibal:The Musical, South
Park:Bigger-Longer and Uncut, Team America:World Police) made a
hilarious comedy that was never a success at the box office, because
it's limited release and unfair rating of NC-17! Since their hardy any
nudity or sex scenes. Sure this film has an adult subject matter and
Dian Bachar's role as Choda Boy is a character with an expert of Sex
Toys. That's probably why the film receive an NC-17 Rating. The film is
extremely funny, it has a shock scene that is disturbingly
unforgettable. Parker is amusing as the lead. Bachar almost steals the
show as Choda Boy and Parker's close friend-Matt Stone has a bit part
and also one of the film's producers.<br /><br />DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an
fine-Dolby Surround 2.0 Sound. DVD has an drunken commentary by the
cast &amp; crew, the second commentary is from the cast and the third is
wild commentary with the South Park writing staff with special guests!
Although the third commentary is a difficult track to listen (You might
need a home theater with a Dolby Pro Logic 2 to hear it). The Second
disc has over 29 minutes worth of Deleted Scenes with optional
commentary by the cast &amp; crew, Documentary of the film title'&quot;The Book
of Orgazmo&quot;, Outtakes and more. This is truly one of the most
underrated comedies of 1990's. An instant cult classic on video.
Alternative Version is also included on the DVD with additional footage
and an different soundtrack. I love the original NC-17 Theatrical Cut
better. Do not miss this raunchy comedy. (****/*****).
