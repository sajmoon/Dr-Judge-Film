I once watched Orgazmo, got hooked and since then I watched it like 50
times. It is one of the films I cannot ever seem to grow tried of. I
don't know what it is about it, but it is somehow so complete in its
rough form.<br /><br />Obviously, it doesn't hurt that there is plenty of nude (and amazingly
gorgeous) women in the film (Chasey Lane; WOW! is the only word that
springs to mind!!!), but also because it is so delightedly respect-less
towards just about anyone or anything.<br /><br />All I can say to this flick is, if you like South Park, you'll LOVE
this one! In fact, anyone with a sense of humour should enjoy this one!<br /><br />7/10
