Orgazmo might sound appealing to young 13-17 year old virgin boys, but this
movie is completely stupid. Not only is there the disappointment of
c*ckteasing nude scenes (with strategically placed objects), but the story
to this piece of sh*t movie is dumb. The creators of South Park made this
movie, and obviously put no effort into this creation at all. I would never
watch this movie because there is nothing comical about it at all. The jokes
in this movie aren't half as funny as the jokes you used to tell each other
in junior high. And THOSE jokes aren't funny at all!!! Do not watch this
movie for any reason at all.
