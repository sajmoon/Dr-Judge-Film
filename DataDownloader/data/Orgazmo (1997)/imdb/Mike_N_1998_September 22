1998_September 22 

Not a bad movie.  With the porn industry becoming mainstream, and with
pornstars enjoying fame similar to that of rock stars, this film fits right
in with the trend.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Joe Young, a young Mormon who solicits for new
church members door-to-door.  Inadvertently, he gets offered a job (which he
accepts because he needs money for his wedding) to play Orgazmo, the crime
fighting superhero, rendering his foes incapacitated with his Orgazmirator
Ray.  &quot;Orgazmo&quot; becomes a hit but Joe feels guilty about doing it.<br /><br />This movie is funny, if you like low-brow humor (which I do).  However, it's
not Academy Award material by any means.  This film is a must see if you are
familiar with the porn industry, or if you are a Trey Parker fan.  There are
many cameos in the film including, Ron Jeremy as Jizz-Master Zero, Chasey
Lain, Julie Ashton, etc..<br /><br />The jokes are at times racy but almost always funny.  I enjoyed this movie
and it's worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Suggestion: Kids won't get the humor, and it's probably not appropriate for
them, so leave them at home.
