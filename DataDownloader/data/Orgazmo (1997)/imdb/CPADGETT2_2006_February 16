what can i say... a movie about a superhero porn star that's really a
Mormon do gooder. it's so freaking ridiculous that it works. fans of
south park and the other trey parker and matt stone offerings should
rent it. totally worth it. you'll catch glimpses of what's to come from
these guys. they're so dead on when it comes to lampooning our crazy
American pop culture. i love it. they never intend to offend anybody,
they intend to offend everybody. nothing is sacred. nothing is taboo.
they just go for it. and that is so refreshing in these times of
political correctness and the crazy notion that cartoons are violent
and promote such behavior. through all their rude, crude jokes parker
and stone somehow always end up delivering a some sort of positive
message. and that's really if you feel like taking it in, heck it's
probably even part of their sick sense of humor. anyway, this movie
isn't as strong as some of their later offerings but i was really
impressed with the production value and flow of comedy in this early
effort. all i can say is that it's so freaking stupid and over the top
you have to love it. &quot;Now you're mayan!&quot;
