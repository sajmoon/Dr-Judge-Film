This movie has the same traits as &quot;Johnny Dangerously&quot;--so outlandish that
it worked!  A wonderful spoof of the porn business, a jab at religions
(which I find just delicious) and packed full of the same twisted sense of
humor that we find in South Park.  Certainly worth the watch at least once.
And, I agree, the humor will be lost on kids and the subject matter is not
appropriate for them anyway.
