This movie is an excellent effort by Trey Parker.  His usually crude
humor is great exaggerated in this movie about a Mormon who gets offered a
job to act in a porn film for $20,000.  He accepts it to get married to
his
fiancee in the Great Mormon temple in Utah.  This movie is very crude, but
amazingly funny.  If you're a Trey Parker fan, you'll love this one.
Except
a lot of unexpected things to happen.  This movie kicks *ss!  IT does not
deserve the NC-17 at all, because there is hardly any female nudity, and
the
male nudity is limited.  The MPAA sucks for branding it with an
NC-17!
