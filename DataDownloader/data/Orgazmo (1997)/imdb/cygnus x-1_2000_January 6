on a so-stupid-it's-funny level, this movie is hard to beat. the fact that
they actually had porn stars in the movie (including a hilarious turn by Ron
Jeremy) only adds to the proceedings.
the movie is crude in terms of language, but surprisingly light on nudity.
(why it got slapped with an NC-17 rating is beyond me). about 25% of the
jokes fall flat but the 75% that worked had me rolling in the floor. the
humor is juvenille but is played with such zeal that is doesn't
matter.<br /><br />while i still prefer Cannibal:The Musical over this movie, it has it's
moments and is clearly inspired. check it out (&quot;or you'll be swimming with
the fishes, SEE?!!)<br /><br />rating:7
