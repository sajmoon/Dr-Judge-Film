I've seen Orgazmo many times and I always have to chuckle over it. The
beginning of the film is fantastic: filled with zingers, and the furious
fists of a Mormon martial artist.
The concept is fresh: a young Mormon acolyte on a mission tries to make
money for a special wedding ceremony by appearing in pornographic films.
Director/Writer/Star Trey Parker is great as the innocent Joe, and his
South
Park partner-in-crime Matt Stone as photographer Dave steals every scene
that he's in. The film stalls a bit just before the climactic final scenes
but overall, it is very funny and really not as offensive as detractors of
Parker and Stone would have you believe.
Well worth it for fans of their series, and for people who like their
comedy
irreverent.
