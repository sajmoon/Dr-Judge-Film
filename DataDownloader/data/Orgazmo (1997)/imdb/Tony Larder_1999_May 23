1999_May 23 

Oh, boy.  Having already recently suffered through &quot;Mafia!&quot; and it's
infantile crudeness, I wasn't ready to make the intellectual sacrifices
needed to enjoy &quot;Orgazmo&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;South Park&quot; has had some very smart and funny moments, but what Stone and
Parker give us here is toilet humor for third-graders.  Funniest thing is,
the real-life porn stars who make appearances;Ron Jeremy, Max Hardcore,
Jill
Kelly and Chasey Lain seem to be &quot;slumming&quot;(after all, Ron was in &quot;George
Wallace&quot; and &quot;Killing Zoe&quot;, Chasey and Jill were both in &quot;He Got Game&quot;,
and
Max Hardcore was in...well, he's pretty good with a video camera).<br /><br />As we already learned in &quot;Mallrats&quot;, farting on a hand is not funny...it's
stupid. If you're looking for a film about crude characters, but with a
bit
more smarts, try the underrated &quot;Ringmaster&quot;.
