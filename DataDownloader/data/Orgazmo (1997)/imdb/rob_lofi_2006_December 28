Trey Parker and Matt Stone make fun of every religion, everyone, and
everything there is to make fun of. So many people take offense to
them, when in the same episode they&#39;re offended about, they&#39;ll make fun
of themselves. It&#39;s silly to take any movie offensively that is a
comedy, unless there were blatant racism or homophobia, or those kind
of socially unacceptable things to joke about, which these guys do push
the lines on some of that too in other projects.<br /><br />This movie definitely mocks the LDS church, but I was Mormon when I
watched it, I wasn&#39;t going actively, but I believed it, and I thought
it was hilarious. Anyone who is LDS could see that almost every
representation of the religion is completely inaccurate. For example
getting married in a LDS Temple is mentioned in the movie as costing
thousands of dollars or whatever, which if someone that is LDS follows
the churches teachings, pays their tithing (the only money that has to
be spent to my knowledge), and is morally on-point enough according to
some fairly high-up church authorities. The only thing that an LDS
member that is rational and open-minded might find offensive is the
nudity and porn element, which is part of the story, but isn&#39;t actual
porno. There is some nudity, but it is primarily a man&#39;s buttocks, or a
woman&#39;s breasts.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this movie is funny, but you have to look at it
light-heartedly, and take it for what it is. Comedy. The comedy is
quite a bit different of a style of humor than South Park, you can see
that the same people make it, but it&#39;s a completely different type of
humor... So check it out, I highly recommend this movie, and I am very
particular about movies, I&#39;ve worked in a movie store, and I know a lot
of film elitist&#39;s, and a lot of them like this movie.
