I don't really care for South Park at all, yet I found this movie to be
really funny. The fight scenes are well executed for a low budget movie.  It
just goes to show you don't need 20 million writers to make a funny movie.
About 95 percent of the jokes work! Thats way more than most movies! One of
my top 10 comedies of all time.
