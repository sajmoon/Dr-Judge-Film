Devout Mormon Joe Young (Trey Parker) is going door to door trying to
sell his bible with his Mormon friend (who's never heard from again).
When he shows up at a porn producer's house and attacked by his goons
for interrupting a porn scene, he beats them all up. This cause the
porn producer to want Joe to be in his movie for no good reason at all
other than it advances the story. Joe reluctantly agrees to pay for his
upcoming wedding. But then sh*t hits the fan in many different ways.
This film is pretty funny when you don't really pay attention to the
plot and in in the right frame of mind (IE. drunk off your ass or
stoned out of your mind) MUCH better than the sad &quot;Baseketball&quot; alleged
comedy.<br /><br />Eye Candy: Juli Aston and Chasey Lain get topless <br /><br />ANTI-eye Candy: LOTS of man ass <br /><br />My Grade: B- <br /><br />DVD Extras: Side A) Theatrical &amp; Unrated versions; Audio Commentary by
