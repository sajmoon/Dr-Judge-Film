1998_December 15 

Having seen this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival, before I
had even heard of South Park or Trey Parker, and without any hype, I have to
say that I, and the entire audience (albeit, an audience at a midnight
screening) were howling with laughter all the way through.<br /><br />This tells me that the people who didn't like the movie went in with some
kind of expectation about what they were about to see.  And, in most cases,
that expectation was probably ill founded.  You probably expect to see some
&quot;SOmething About Mary&quot; rip off, or something in the Jim Carrey genre
(pre-Truman Show).<br /><br />What makes Orgazmo funny is that it pulls no punches and maintains no
pretensions.  It works hard to make you laugh and does not expend a moment
of energy on anything else.<br /><br />The difficulty is that Trey Parker is a complete original.  He is also very
young and without much experience.  What we are seeing in him and his
partner Matt Stone, is the evolution of a comic genius.  Maybe they don't
know how to write convincing characters, or how to make a full 90 minute
film work entirely, but they have a unique and distinctive brand of humour.<br /><br />Orgazmo is far from perfect and belongs in the low-budget/indie category,
but don't let anyone tell you that this movie isn't funny.  It just might
not be &quot;your kind of humour&quot;
