1998_October 24 

Well, I saw Orgazmo last night.  Though it was funny and had great moments
(T-rex's scene and the real Orgazmator shot at strangers scene), I was
expecting more from Trey Parker.<br /><br />Just because it is a parody of the porn industry doesn't mean that it has to
be as painfully badly acted as a porno. (Ron Jeremy and G-Fresh)  The script
also left something to be desired as it set up a sequel we'll probably never
see and it did its absolute best to avoid showing anything even remotely
pornographic with the exception of dildos and more than a couple of nude
male rear shots.<br /><br />That said, I'm surprised this got an NC-17.  Language is no worse than what
we've heard before in R-rated movies. (Clerks)  Frontal nudity is avoided at
all costs.  The subject matter is no more provocative than other comedies
this year. (There's Something About Mary; Happiness; etc.)<br /><br />All in all, I left satisfied, but got the feeling that if you're not a hard
core fan of South Park or the porn industry, you're probably better off
waiting until this comes out on video.
