Okay, if you don't like South Park, Cannibal the Musical, Baseketball or
anything else Matt Stone and Trey Parker are famous for, you probably
won't
like Orgazmo. It's a silly little movie, but like Baseketball, it has a
few
classic Matt and Trey gags that make all the B.S. worthwhile. It's not
supposed to be an instant classic, their comedy is all about breaking down
stupid conservative barriers while making funny poop jokes. It's dumb in a
really witty way. If you have no sense of humor, you won't like this
movie.
If you don't think the combination of soul-soliciting Mormons and hardcore
porn is funny in even the most scatological sense, then you won't like
this
movie. If you don't laugh or make a wisecrack when someone farts, you
won't
like this movie. It's just that simple. I, however, find it difficult not
to
laugh at this movie because I'm able to put away any uptight, artsy-fartsy
ideals I have and just giggle at two guys being silly, like in high
school.
And if you just let go, you'll find it really is a witty brand of low-brow
comedy, to say the least.
