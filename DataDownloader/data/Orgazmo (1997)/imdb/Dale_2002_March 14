As a lover of Trey Parker and Matt Stones' work i had great expectations
for
this film which were completely satisfied. Seeing as my humour revolves
around childish sexual jokes, i loved this film. I can only say that this
film will only appeal to people who aren't easily offended and who can look
past a low budget, unimaginative script and slightly wooden acting which
this film certainly does possess.
