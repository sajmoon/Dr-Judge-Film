&quot;I&#39;m not a superhero, I&#39;m a Latter-Day Saint!&quot; I&#39;m a middle-aged woman
who is not a big South Park fan, but I think this movie is one of the
funniest I&#39;ve ever seen. I didn&#39;t care about the fact-checking errors,
I only liked that it made me laugh until I cried. (Then again, I&#39;m a
fan of the Farrelly brothers, too.) I can&#39;t say why I like it so much,
except that it pokes fun at nearly everything. And the nearly utter
lack of real &quot;porn&quot; content is maybe the funniest part. I can&#39;t even
quite figure out why it got an NC-17 rating... There is also an
interesting subtext that the geeks of the world would be happier in the
porn industry, and that even older women and those with
super-Raphaelesque bodies (T-Rex, anyone?) can find a place to feel at
home in that industry. Absolute claptrap but funny to contemplate. I
gotta say, it just takes an incredibly warped mind to come up with an
idea like this, and it&#39;s not going to be everyone&#39;s cup of tea.
