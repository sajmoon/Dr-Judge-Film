1999_September 23 

Cheesily made but undeniably funny movie by SOUTH PARK auteur Trey Parker,
in which a proselytizing Mormon (played by Parker) is wooed into the
adult-film business. In the hands of Alexander Payne, this would be a dry
Bunuelian jeremiad. In the hands of Parker, it has a coarse but sincere
appeal. For late-night, post-six-beers cable-watching only.
