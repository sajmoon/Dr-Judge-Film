The South Park boys have done it again.  'Orgazmo' is the funniest movie
I've ever had the privilege of viewing.  I had to drive to a small theatre
about 45 minutes away due to the low number of reels released.  It was,
without a doubt, worth it.
If you love pornography or funny movies, this is one of the best movies you
can see.
One advisory, however: Ignore the NC-17 rating.  Aside from a few tit shots
and a couple male asses, this movie's much tamer than even Basic
Instinct.
