Orgazmo should rank among the top ten movies in anyones mind.  It is
absolutely hilarious 100 percent of the time.  From the mormon jokes to
sancho, this movie has it all.  There are people that say this movie is not
funny and stupid, but they are weak minded and cannot respect Trey Parker's
brilliant humor.<br /><br />The cast includes Trey parker along with many porn stars, from Chasey Lain
to everyone's favorite, Ron Jeremy.  Also Lloyd Kaufman from Troma video
makes a special guest appearance.  That alone lets you know it will be
hilarious.<br /><br />If you are not mormon, go see this movie.  You will laugh out loud.  This
movie is a cult classic.  you will watch it over and over again.  I have
the
movie on DVD myself. It is the greatest movie ever.
