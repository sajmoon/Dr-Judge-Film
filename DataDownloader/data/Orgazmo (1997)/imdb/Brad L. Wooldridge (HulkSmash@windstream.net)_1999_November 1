1999_November 1 

Orgazmo appeared and disappeared faster in 1997 than Showgirls.  Part of the
blame is the nefarious NC-17 rating which both did not deserve.  However,
Orgazmo is the better of both films simply because it tries much harder than
Showgirls did to deliver a product based purely on shock
value.<br /><br />Orgazmo is the story of a young Mormon languishing in the cesspool that is
Los Angeles try to convert the jaded populace into members of the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  He fails at that, but succeeds at being
the luckless star of low-budget adult film, Orgazmo, featuring a super-hero
who wears a weapon that induces instantaneous orgasms in his foes and a
stalwart sidekick, Choda-Boy, who wears a serendipitous dildo atop his
head.<br /><br />The performances were rather good, especially director/writer Trey Parker as
our heroic protagonist, and Dian Bachar, as the scientist turned porn star. 
While the film was made on a shoestring budget, and boy, does it show, it is
earnest, funny, and well-paced.  Parker took a mere $600,000 and really
crafted a terrific movie that no one will likely ever see.<br /><br />Recommended.
