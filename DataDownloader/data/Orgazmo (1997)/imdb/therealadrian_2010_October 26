Fans of South Park will love to go back and see the live action movies
of its directors, Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Orgazmo even features
Trey Parker as the main character, Orgazmo.<br /><br />In this hilarious laugh at the porn industry with a bit of a tongue in
cheek look at mormons, Trey Parker plays a mormon who happens to be an
expert in martial arts who ends up being the accidental star of an
adult movie called &#x22;Orgazmo&#x22;. This isn&#x27;t a fall from grace ride,
though, as he keeps most of his morals by using a &#x22;stunt cock&#x22; and
keeps the moral high ground.<br /><br />The movie has jokes at so many levels, including actual members from
the porn industry, deliberately bad special effects and a plot that is
both funny and interesting, albeit in a slapstick comedy way.<br /><br />Provided that you can get over them making fun of mormons and the porn
industry, in other words provided that you aren&#x27;t a total prude, you
will love this movie. Get over the lack of special effects and love
this for the cult classic that it is.<br /><br />This is a pure masterpiece of cinema, from the people that bring you
the genius that is South Park.
