1999_December 19 

I, like many others out there, have had the intriguing experience of seeing
Trey Parker's Orgazmo. Hailing from South Park fame, Parker hits it again
in
this slightly crude, yet absorbingly humorous comedy.<br /><br />The story focuses mainly on a Mormon missionary named Joe Young who ends up
being sent to Los Angeles to convert the masses. Heading door to door,
Young, played by Parker, ends up inadvertently staring in a porn film. I
believe the words &quot;Hi-jinx ensues&quot; apply here. The jokes in the movie, for
the most part, poke fun at both the porn industry and the Mormon faith.
They
don't, however, take on the biting and somewhat overdone humour found in
some of Parker's other project, and end up staying quite light hearted.<br /><br />Although it relies somewhat heavily on sight gags of the more raunchy
persuasion, the chemistry between Parker and fellow Baseketball star Dian
Bachar lifts the film to a new level. Special kudos to Bachar for a
particularly beautiful performance as Ben Chapelski (AKA Choda Boy). His
style of mixing melodrama with a baby-faced innocence brings this movie
from
the level of a run-of-the-mill post-National Lampoon comedy to a film that
stands out.<br /><br />All in all the movie is a definate pick up when perusing the shelves of
your
local videostore. The surprising lack of excessive nudity makes it safe for
almost any viewer, while the humor is quick paced and rarely segments
factions of society away from it, as Parker's comedy tends to do. If you're
looking for something to do tonight, why not rent it.
