Ok, I love South Park and consume a fair amount of porn, so from what I
read
here I should really like this, right? Super-wrong!<br /><br />This is easily one of the most uninspired, stupid, and genuinely unfunny
movies I have ever seen. The storyline is so horrible I don't even want to
talk about it. The jokes are simply not funny. (I'm not even sure there
actually were any jokes in it.)<br /><br />If you're like me and think about watching this movie because Trent Parker
made it and because there should be some juicy sex scenes in it -- think
again. Don't waste a minute of your life on this piece of
nothingness.
