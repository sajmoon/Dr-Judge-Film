No doubt about it. This actually is one of the funniest movies ever made.
But people with a very low, or moral, sense of humor wouldn't agree. The
movie has a very sick kind of comedy and makes people laugh throughout the
whole movie. Trey Parker is a comical genius, I can't imagine how he could
come up with a strange story like this. The jokes are about the same level
of Southpark, except their a little more pornographic and satire related.
So
even if some of the scenes might be a little dorky all the comedy in this
movie evens it out. If your a big comedy fan you must see this
movie
