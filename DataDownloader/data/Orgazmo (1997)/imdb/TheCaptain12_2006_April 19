I&#39;ll admit, when I got together with a few friends to watch this movie,
my expectations were very low, even for a comedy. Since all I knew
about the film was that it reeked of Trey Parker&#39;s childish brand of
tasteless, banal humor, I didn&#39;t think it would be on par with some of
the funnier movies of the nineties. Man, I hate being right all the
time. During the first three quarters of the movie (that&#39;s all my
friends and I could stomach before turning it off), I think I might
have chuckled once. I can&#39;t believe Parker had actually improved on his
mediocre, juvenile, body of work with South Park and Team America:
World Police. This film didn&#39;t even have shock value, a seemingly
must-have for Parker. It chronicles a Mormon missionary&#39;s
transformation into a male porn star. Sound stupid? It actually plays
out worse than it sounds. But it&#39;s not the plot that drives a decent
comedy, it&#39;s the humor, right!? I wish it did. The &quot;jokes&quot; in this
movie are so witless, it makes South Park look like Frasier. Running
gags that aren&#39;t funny the first time are rehashed again and again in
the same pointless manner. Instead of making satirical jabs at the porn
industry or the Mormon religion, Parker makes dimwitted toilet jokes
and calls his sidekick &quot;Choda boy.&quot; That&#39;s not even funny! Which brings
me to the other downsides of this movie. Other than an unfunny, trite
script and a stupid story, the cinematography is horrible, even for a
comedy flick, the characters range from annoying to detestable, and the
poor production quality makes this movie even worse than it already is.
The only thing shocking about this movie is that Trey Parker wasn&#39;t
lynched for making it. If I could, I would give this movie negative
stars. Avoid at all costs. Rent Billy Madison, Wayne&#39;s World, or Tommy
Boy instead. Don&#39;t waste your money on this witless wonder.
