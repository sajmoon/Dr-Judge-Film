I thought this movie was one of the funniest movies ever made.  I am a
huge
fan of Trey Parker and Matt Stone.  They are brilliant.  The film is meant
to look cheap.  It's part of the reason why it's so funny.  They were
making
fun of crappy 'B' movies.  Notice how everyone in the movie new Kung-Fu?
The expressions and reactions Trey has to everything are hilarious.  And
Matt Stone is so funny as 'Dave the lighting guy'.  This movie is
great.
