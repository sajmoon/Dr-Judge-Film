2000_November 8 

The film is a very low budget but campy movie.  It was mainly given an NC17
rating because of its South Park connection.  I have seen far more sexual
things in other movies rated R than in this one.  I actually got to see it
in what I think was the only movie theater in my county to have shown it.
It makes fun of Mormons but in a good way since the hero in the film Joe
Young is a Mormon Missionary who becomes involved with the porn industry in
order to earn money so that he can marry his true love at the temple. While
he is doing this he winds up saving the day with his martial arts! It also
makes fun of the porn industry with things such as having a c**k stand in.
The movie leaves a possibility for a sequel at the end but I doubt that one
will ever be produced since this low budget flick received an NC17 rating
which in the Movie business is considered the kiss of death since most major
newspapers and TV stations will not show ads for it.<br /><br />For fans of South Park this film will suit your tastes. Not recommend it for
any minors.  It's adult comedy for adults.
Buy the Video and if it comes out on DVD get that because I seriously doubt
that this film will be shown on your local TV anytime soon unless its a
severely cut version.
