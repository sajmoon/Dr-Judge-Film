Funny satirical mixture of super hero movies and the overrated BOOGIE
NIGHTS.  A definite improvement over Parker's earlier feature, the sleep
inducing CANNIBAL THE MUSICAL though not as funny as his later SOUTH PARK TV
series.  Here he plays a mormon bible salesman who inadvertently gets
involved playing a super hero named Orgazmo in some porn
movies.<br /><br />Has a definite look and feel of a really cheap direct to video product.  The
special effects are awful, the fight scenes are real fake looking, and the
acting (with the exception of Jacobs who does a great job playing a really
slimy porn director) quite poor.  Yet it is structured well enough to keep
you consistently amused even around the rough edges.<br /><br />The porn scenes themselves are so over the top that they are a absolute
riot.  Yet despite it's subject matter (and a cast of actual porn stars)
there is NO FEMALE NUDITY.  In fact the only nudity you will see are close
ups of hairy male rear ends (I'm NOT kidding!).<br /><br />Religious people, especially mormons, are made to look so simplistic and
sterile that it is sure to offend anyone involved in that area.  Yet since
most of them won't bother to watch this film it probably won't hurt. 
Overall quite good natured and not bad for it's type.<br /><br />Has a plethora of porn and cult celebrities in cameo roles.  The best by far
goes to Ron Jeremy who not only gets involved in a funny debate about the
merits (and demerits) of porn, but is also in a big kung fu showdown. Also
has Troma producer Lloyd Kaufman as a doctor with beautiful porn star Jill
Kelly as a nurse( she doesn't say anything but still commands your
attention). SOUTH PARK cocreator Matt Stone can be seen as a crew member. 
His lines aren't particularly funny, but the way he says them is.
