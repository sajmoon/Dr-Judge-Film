Mormon Joe Young is door knocking when he is forced to defend himself.  He
catches the eye of a porn producer who recognises that Joe's fighting style
could be used to add realism to his new porno character Orgazmo and also the
gimmick of an innocent Mormon in a porno could get good publicity.  Despite
his beliefs Joe agrees but when one film turns into another Joe finds he is
trapped in porn &#150; where will it all end?<br /><br />To set the scene &#150; I'm a big South park fan, I even liked that terrible
Baseketball thing they made!  So I came to this expecting it to be very rude
but also very funny.  However it isn't.  To criticse it for a bad plot or
bad acting or bad sets or bad overall production or direction is to miss the
point totally &#150; this is all about the childish humour that we all know and
love.<br /><br />However it is obvious from this that Parker and Stone are good at what they
do &#150; it's just that here they fail!  It never gets above being silly and
juvenile.  The jokes revolve around us being amused by plastic penises and
stuff like that.  There are a few bits I found funny (`Jesus!' `where?') but
most of it is puerile.  However in fairness it does have a certain rough
charm about it and I could see elements of good South park episodes to come
being birthed here.<br /><br />The use of porn may have seemed a good idea but really it fails on two
counts.  First &#150; it isn't really funny.  Jokes about DADV
(double-anal-double-vaginal) sex with an old women may be amusing for a
split second, until you realise that the stuff they're using for humour is
probably not as bad as some things that are filmed in LA.  Also the use of
porn cameos fails because it's a bit old hat, even if porn is becoming
mainstream.  Oh look it's Ron Jeremy, oh look it's Chasey Lain, Shayla
LaVeaux, Serenity, Juli Ashton, Barocca, Jeanna Fine, Jacklyn Lick etc etc. 
It's not funny but it's distracting.  I'm sure the guys had fun with so many
porn actresses around but that doesn't mean the jokes are funny.  And
personally I think putting people like Max Hardcore up on a pedestal is in
very poor taste even if porn is mainstream &#150; watch some of his stuff and
you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />The cast are silly &#150; although I do like Parker's wide eyed performances, but
here he had little to work with.  The porn cameos are diverting for those
who know but don't help the film.  Overall the lack of plot, good
performances, good design or good direction are all minor weaknesses
compared to the simple problem of the film just not being anywhere near
funny enough.
