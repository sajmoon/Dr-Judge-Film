2004_October 29 
I first saw this film several years ago by accident. And the worlds
never been the same since. It was late night on paid cable, I had just
finished watching some movie and was about to flip the station when I
saw what was next (was not in the mood for a tit-flick) when they
happened to play a short on the making of the movie.<br /><br />Seeing one of the boys from south park stopped my hand. Hearing him
describe orgazmo as a porno kung-fu comedy made me sit back down.<br /><br />If you enjoy the irreverent humour of South Park you cannot go wrong
here. This movie has everything! Kung-fu! Ron Jeremy! Comedy! Chasey
Lane topless!<br /><br />I anxiously await this title hitting DVD.
