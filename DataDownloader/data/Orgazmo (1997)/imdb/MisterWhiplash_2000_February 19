This film is very silly, very stupid, and very funny. Thanks to
writer/director Trey Parker, we can view at the industry known as Porno
in a way that is not as serious as in Boogie Nights. The film takes
some turn as that are known to happen in these types of movies, but it
is even more humorous than in the others. Not to mention Parker teams
up with his South Park co-star Matt Stone as a guy who doesn&#39;t want to
sound like a queer or nothing. Along with a funny cast of supporting
characters, this may not be Parker and Stone&#39;s best achievement yet-
matter of fact in a way it lacks the polish that their first
collaboration Cannibal the Musical had- it&#39;s still a worthy effort with
enough laughs to make it worthwhile. If only once, as a teen. B
