This has got to be one of the funniest films about the Porn industry
ever.<br /><br />Trey Parker proves to us all that he's an expert at feigning naivite, as
well as writing a film that is open and fit for a sequel (as opposed to
South Park:  BLU, which is just going to get one anyway).<br /><br />Orgazmo is perhaps one of the best superheroes out there, right up there
with Freakazoid.  This film is perfect for anyone who loves porn, loves
South Park, loves superheroes, or any combination thereof.  This film should
have gotten an R rating, as there is only one scene of nudity and,
apparently, less cursing than the South Park movie.  There is plenty of
innuendo and, of course, the fact that all of Choda Boy's weapons are made
of...how can I put this printably...artificial phallic
devices.
