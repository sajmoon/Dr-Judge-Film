When people think of Trey Parker &amp; Matt Stone, they usually think of
South Park, but this film is just as good in all aspects. after
watching this film you will never forget the term &#39;stunt cock&#39; or the
phrase &quot;Now, I don&#39;t want to sound like a queer or nothing...&quot; this
film may not be a box-office smash, but it as suitable for a Saturday
night with some friends as Airplane. It was originally slated to be a
musical, much like Parker&#39;s first work, Cannibal! The Musical but they
felt that it wouldn&#39;t come across with audiences as well. There are a
lot of good ties with other works but Parker &amp; Stone, such as T-Rex&#39;s
voice. (Which is so obviously dubbed by Parker)<br /><br />So all in all, this film is an underrated comedy another of their
films, BASEketball and for any South Park fans, this is the perfect
film for you because it has that recognisable wit and tongue-in-cheek
offensiveness.
