Orgazmo is wildly uneven but has enough hilarious moments to recommend it.
As usual Parker and Stone are at their best when they're poking their
fingers in Hollywood's eye--and of course that's for much of the film. The
parallels between 'straight' Hollywood and the porn industry--and the
compromises and justifications people make to be successful in them--are
unmistakable. If you have a pulse you will laugh out loud at least once,
even if you find much of the film offensive.
