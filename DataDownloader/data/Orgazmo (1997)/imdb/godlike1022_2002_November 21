Unless you're an idiot you can see the low production values for this
movie
only enhance the viewing pleasure. This is Trey and Matt at their best
since
Cannibal: The Musical. This is the perfect mix of Low- and High- Brow
humor
that make them endearing to such a wide audience in their half hour South
Park shows.
