1999_December 30 

Throw in a morally confused, financially troubled betrothed mormon, a porn
star with Ph.D's and a knack for creating inventions, a sleazy porn movie
maker with his fingers in everything, and a lighting guy with no clue as to
what is going on on or off the set and you wind up with
Orgazmo.
     
     
      Orgazmo tells the story of our mormon hero, Joe Young, and his quest
to become a good mormon while paying for the worldly things his fiance'
desires all the while keeping to his beliefs.  Written by Trey Parker of
South Park fame, the jokes and situations are similar to that show,  but now
they are applied to everything from the mormon faith to the porn industry.<br /><br />     There is no scintillating, sophisticated humor here, but there is a lot
of well placed visual dick jokes and instances where things are taken too
literally or where nothing is held back. Childish behavior runs rampant.
Door to door testimony may never be the same. Cameo appearances by Ron
Jeremey and other porn queens give it porn movie credit, but there was
little nudity, the jokes and situations were the real focus.<br /><br />      If you like the old Batman television series, awkward sex jokes and
great quotes by memorable figures, you should see Orgazmo and decide for 
yourself. And after the credits have rolled, Dave the light guy's quotes
will stay with you..&quot; I don't wanna sound like a queer or nothing, but I
think De Peche Mode is a really sweet band.<br /><br />     8 1/4 out of 10
