I feel that I have to push it up! If s.o. just looks out the rating, he
might be put off. And he might miss a little gem of a comedy. I am
aware that the movie is not for everyone. But some of the people who
rated it badly obviously just didn&#39;t get the tongue-in-cheek humour. In
the first 5 minutes of the movie I also thought &quot;what the hell...&quot; but
then I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is quite a special treat. I also
recommended it to a friend who was quite sceptic and didn&#39;t follow my
recommendation for a long time. But in the end he ended up quite
enthusiastic about it. (by the way: I find the minimum-of-10-lines-rule
here quite stupid)
