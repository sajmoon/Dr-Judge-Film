1999_May 11 

Considering this project was put out by Trey Parker of South Park fame, I
was expecting something along the lines of BaseketBall.Instead, I was
initially thrilled about the story of
a married Mormon who must make a choice between his faith and cold hard
cash.This was hilarious for the first 45 minutes,however as the movie
progresses and Orgazmo takes on a life beyond the xxx films this movie
turns
campy in an uncool kinda campy way.It appeared at first that this was the
intent but the cheesy for cheesy's sake gave me lactose
intolerance.I
suggest a viewing if time permits and if you are in the
right
state of mind(a little 4:20 and some beers should suffice!).
Overall a good original effort that ends up being a bit of a letdown but
unforgettable for its stomach wrenching laughs.
