I have to start this by saying that I hate South Park. However, this movie
was very funny and surprisingly sweet-natured underneath all the
crudeness.
What I found especially appealing was the fact that the characters were
all
true to themselves. Trey Parker wrote the title character and his
girlfriend
as real people who never compromised their beliefs. Yet the film is
hilarious (for the most part) when it is being raunchy!  I recommend this
to
anyone who likes to laugh and who doesn't get upset over sexual
humor.
