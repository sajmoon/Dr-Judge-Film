Joe Young is a Mormon, spreading the word of Jesus Christ in Los
Angeles. He stumbles upon a house where they are shooting a
pornographic movie, and despite his beliefs, finds the lure of
compensation too good to turn down a role.<br /><br />Trey Parker and Matt Stone had only just begun &#x22;South Park&#x22; when this
film was released. The acting is cheesy, the lines are over-acted, but
there&#x27;s something just really funny about the movie. Like their even
more amateur production, &#x22;Cannibal&#x22;, they don&#x27;t require a big budget to
make things funny.<br /><br />You might have to find Mormons or porn funny to really appreciate this
film. I don&#x27;t know. Of course, if you are opposed to porn or are
Mormon, you probably should stay away from it, because you&#x27;re likely to
get offended. While tamer than you might expect, it is by no means a
clean film.
