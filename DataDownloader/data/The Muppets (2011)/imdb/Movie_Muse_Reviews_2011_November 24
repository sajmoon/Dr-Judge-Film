Forget former child stars and D-list celebrities, The Muppets needed a
comeback more than any of them. Heck, we needed them. We live in glum
times, people. Optimism seems about as trendy as boy bands these days.
Maybe that&#x27;s why Jim Henson&#x27;s beloved creatures disappeared in the
first place: The world disregarded the sense of unabashed silliness
that they embodied for 30-some years in exchange for ideals such as
progressiveness and &#x22;edutainment.&#x22;<br /><br />The wayward trajectory of the Muppets in the 21st Century definitely
fueled the fire for Disney&#x27;s &#x22;reboot.&#x22; Art imitates life here as &#x22;The
Muppets&#x22; focuses on bringing the gang back together and ultimately
defying those who believe there&#x27;s no longer a place for the kind of
entertainment and energy they bring.<br /><br />It only takes moments, however, to realize their place in all-ages
entertainment stands eternal. Nostalgia covers this film like a warm &#x97;
felt &#x97; blanket. The Muppets have returned and hopefully for good.<br /><br />Co-writer and star Jason Segel must&#x27;ve realized in no time that the
idea of the Muppets drifting apart spoke quite directly to the themes
that the various shows and movies of the last 40 years have championed.
To represent the lifelong fan spurned by Jim Henson Company&#x27;s inability
to make the Muppets relevant in today&#x27;s age, Segel and Nicholas Stoller
create Walter, the first truly humanoid Muppet, though his fuzzy nature
is seen as something that simply makes him &#x22;different than all the
other kids.&#x22; When he first sees the Muppets as a child, he becomes
their biggest fan.<br /><br />Walter travels with his older (human) brother, Gary (Segel) and Gary&#x27;s
girlfriend of 10 years, Mary (Amy Adams), to Los Angeles to visit the
old Muppet theater. After sneaking into Kermit&#x27;s old office, Walter
learns of an evil plan by oil tycoon Tex Richman (Chris Cooper), who
plans to knock the theater down to drill for oil. He convinces Gary and
Mary to help him warn the Muppets so that they can band together and
put on a show to raise the money needed to save the theater.<br /><br />&#x22;The Muppets&#x22; features countless easter eggs for those who enjoyed the
Muppets as children and now have children, while remaining simple and
innocent enough in delivery to be loved by said children. It&#x27;s also
extremely faithful to the silly and musical nature of the brand, but
with the self-awareness necessary to be a hit with folks of all ages of
&#x22;the Modern era.&#x22; One of the funniest bits is when the Muppets learn
Miss Piggy currently resides in Paris and determine the fastest way to
travel there is &#x22;by map.&#x22; This, of course, refers to the movie
convention of showing lines moving across a map to demonstrate a major
change in a story&#x27;s location. Where once was a flaw in logic/realism
becomes a hilarious joke. Wocka-wocka.<br /><br />A similar attitude is taken toward the musical numbers. &#x22;Life&#x27;s A Happy
Song,&#x22; the first major number, exudes &#x22;Muppets&#x22; catchiness despite all
its corniness, while the simplistic emotionally soul-bearing ballads
the brand has been most known for (such as &#x22;Rainbow Connection,&#x22; which
gets its own spotlight) show up too. There&#x27;s the hilarious yet deeply
felt &#x22;Man or Muppet,&#x22; in which we see both a Muppet version of Segel
and a human version of Walter (a cameo of course &#x85; you&#x27;ll be amused).
Like any musical, the songs work best when they naturally fit in with
the story. Also, Oscar nominee Chris Cooper raps. I&#x27;ll leave it at
that.<br /><br />The many cameos are befitting a &#x22;Muppet&#x22; movie, but the humans never
dominate; that would not be true to the mission of the entire film. As
perfect as Segel and Adams are for their roles, this movie stars
Walter, Kermit, Miss Piggy, Animal (hysterical) among the many others.
One almost wishes there could have been more screen time given to some
of the memorable Muppets not named Kermit, Miss Piggy, Gonzo or Fozzie.
Personally, some more Bunson and Beaker would&#x27;ve been nice. Hopefully
this is sequel fodder.<br /><br />At the same time, part of what makes this movie excellent is the way it
uses nostalgia and rallies around the idea that the Muppets should
never be forgotten. The story works perfectly in context, but as such
it&#x27;s not one that can be replicated in future films. It will take some
more outside-the-box thinking to keep the Muppets on this roll, but no
doubt &#x22;The Muppets&#x22; will spur on some kind of long-term plan for these
beloved characters whether in more films or back to television again.<br /><br />~Steven C<br /><br />Visit my site, moviemusereviews.com!
