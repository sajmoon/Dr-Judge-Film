&#x27;THE MUPPETS&#x27;: Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br /><br />Reboot of the popular Jim Henson created puppet film series, which
began in 1979 and was based on the television series which ran from
1976 to 1981. It was directed by James Bobin (co-creator of the
television series &#x27;THE FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS&#x27;) and written by it&#x27;s
star Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller (who directed &#x27;FORGETTING SARAH
MARSHALL&#x27; which also starred Segel). It&#x27;s the first &#x27;MUPPETS&#x27; feature
film in a dozen years and is highly reminiscent of the films that were
popular in the late 70&#x27;s and early 80&#x27;s rather than the more recent
crop. The movie is the perfect tribute to the long running series and
should please almost any fan. <br /><br />The story revolves around an evil businessman named Tex Richman (Chris
Cooper) who&#x27;s plotting to tear down the Muppet theater and drill for
oil beneath it. Three big Muppet fans named Gary (Segel), Gary&#x27;s
girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) and Gary&#x27;s puppet brother Walter (voiced by
Peter Linz) discover this while touring the old abandoned theater. They
learn that the only way to save the Muppet theater is to raise $10
million so they go searching for Kermit (voiced by Steve Whitmire) to
let him know. Kermit and his new friends then decide to go on a road
trip to find the other Muppets (who have all split up) and devise a
plan to put on a fundraiser show in order to raise the money to save
the theater. <br /><br />The film is surprisingly witty and packed with laughs, the music and
dance numbers are all top-notch and the cast is excellent. Above all
there&#x27;s just a great energy to it and &#x27;feel good&#x27; vibe. There&#x27;s also of
course that great nostalgic touch and 80&#x27;s feel; if you&#x27;re a fan of
&#x27;THE MUPPETS&#x27;, at least in their early glory days, you&#x27;ll definitely
like this film. I think the most important compliment to give it is
that it&#x27;s a great family film but it&#x27;s not dumbed down for the kids;
it&#x27;s still very intelligent and clever. It is possible to make a good
kids film and have it be quality entertainment that can entertain
adults as well. This is one of those films, it succeeds on almost every
level and shouldn&#x27;t disappoint anyone who knows what to expect; it&#x27;s
&#x27;The Muppets&#x27; done right!<br /><br />Watch our movie review show &#x27;MOVIE TALK&#x27; at:
