I was looking forward to watching this film having been a fan of the
Muppets for a long time. This film had few laughs, dragged on for too
long and had far too many all human scenes. The songs were lame. The
Muppets were just in the background in this movie. I didn&#x27;t care for
any of the human acting and the writing was poor. I&#x27;m amazed at the
scores and reviews on IMDb. I just don&#x27;t understand why people think
this was such a good movie. Kids will get really bored with this one
and most adults will too.<br /><br />I did read that Frank Oz did not agree with the script and did not work
on this movie. I can see why now and wish Disney had let him do the
movie the way he wanted.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t waste your money at the theater with this movie. It is at best a
DVD rental at a discount price.
