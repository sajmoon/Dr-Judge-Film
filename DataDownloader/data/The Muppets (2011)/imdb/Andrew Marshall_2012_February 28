I was never a massive fan of the Muppets as a kid, but I have to
confess that I found &#x22;The Muppets&#x22; movie very entertaining. <br /><br />The story follows a group of Muppets fans who try to get the Muppets
back together in order to save their theatre. The Muppets had split up
and were following various careers when Gary, Mary and Walter set out
to reunite them and save the theatre.<br /><br />It obviously isn&#x27;t the most taxing of movies and you&#x27;ll enjoy all your
favourite characters. There are also numerous special appearances to
look forward to. Jack Black appears in a few very funny scenes and the
whole film is very enjoyable.
