American glove puppetry, or Muppets , was long one of the people&#x27;s
primary forms of entertainment. After a lull it is today enjoying a
renaissance, sporting new trappings and traveling via new mediums.<br /><br />A bit of background. It is believed glove puppetry first took the stage
in China in the early 1300s. Traditional glove-puppet shows were staged
on narrow, highly ornamented wooden platforms. They were staged on
special days, such as temple openings, birthdays, and during festivals,
the point being to thank and honor, through entertainment, the gods
that were in attendance and watching over the mortals in attendance.
Puppets were about 30 centimeters in height, with small heads and
intricately embroidered costumes. Not so, however, since the invention
of felt.<br /><br />OK, so &#x22;The Muppets&#x22; isn&#x27;t quite as good as back in the day, but it&#x27;s
still a real pleasure, as Kermit and friends move to Texas with the aim
of putting on a Broadway show. As with the first two movies, there&#x27;s
lots of musical numbers and some lesser-known famous people in bit
parts. Really fun.<br /><br />A better alternative to renting this movie would be to add the first
season of the Muppet Show to DVD collection and to stick with watching
the Muppet Movie and the Great Muppet Caper...
