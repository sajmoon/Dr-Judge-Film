Very disappointing. I&#x27;m a big Muppets fan. This cheap film doesn&#x27;t
compare in any way to The Muppet Movie.<br /><br />I have literally have almost nothing positive about The Muppets. A
couple of jokes made me chuckle. The two lead human actors are just
annoying, and &#x22;Walter&#x22; the confused muppet is just plain and boring.<br /><br />2011&#x27;s meager offerings suggest that film studios have thrown their
hands up in the air, and are willing to plunder every sacred
institution for next week&#x27;s paycheck.<br /><br />It&#x27;s not that good films aren&#x27;t being made. They just aren&#x27;t being made
in Hollywood.
