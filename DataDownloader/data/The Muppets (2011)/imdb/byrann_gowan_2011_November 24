For all of you who are wondering if this will even come close to
capturing the magic of the original Muppet movie, I just have one thing
to say to you: go see this movie!!!!! I was a little worried myself
that this movie would not be great, but tonight, I gave it a chance.
And I left with a smile on my face. :) The story is that Gary (Jason
Segel), Mary (Amy Adams), and Walter (the new Muppet) decide to take a
trip down to Los Angeles; Walter wants to see the Muppet studios, but
Mary and Gary are going for their 10th year anniversary of dating.
There, they discover the oil tycoon Tex Richman&#x27;s (Chris Cooper) plan
to tear down the Muppet theater. That&#x27;s when they decide to get the
Muppets gang back together, and to put on one last show to raise enough
money to save the theater. I&#x27;ll let you put two and two together now.<br /><br />Warning: This just might be my longest review so far on this website.
That&#x27;s right: I loved this film so much that I have to ramble on and on
about how much I love it.<br /><br />Let me first start off with the behind-the-scenes work. Jason Segel, I
applaud you. You believed in this movie more than anybody else, and it
is why they trusted you, my man. Thank you so much for everything you
have done on this film; the result is that kids are now laughing at the
Muppets, while adults are reminiscing about the old days when Kermit,
Fozzie, Miss Piggy, Gonzo, and the rest would come into their TV&#x27;s and
bring laughter into their homes. Both generations are coming out with
smiles on their faces. As for the rest of the crew, thank you so much
for doing your job right. I am so happy that cgi and 3d was not used
here, so thank you for not incorporating those elements.<br /><br />Now, to the actors (the human actors). Jason Segel and Amy Adams are
perfectly corny in this, but it works here, because it&#x27;s the muppets!
Their little story on the side was great; it was not overplayed, it was
just right. I won&#x27;t spoil what this side-story is, but trust me, you&#x27;ll
enjoy it. Chris Cooper was perfectly evil here. I would say that he was
one of the most evil characters in the history of the Muppets, but even
he gets a song in this movie.<br /><br />Speaking of the songs, they are all so great and corny here. From the
new songs, like &#x22;Life&#x27;s a Happy Song,&#x22; to the great old ones, like
(yes, you are hearing this right) &#x22;The Rainbow Connection.&#x22; They even
have the celebrities in this movie singing &#x22;Mahna Mahna&#x22; in the
credits. Loved every bit of it.<br /><br />And finally, the stars themselves: the Muppets. The trailers did
emphasize Jason Segel and Amy Adams, but make no mistake, this is a
Muppet film, and the whole entire gang was back. Kermit is still the
normal Muppet trying to pull it all together, Fozzie still has a bad
sense of humour, Miss Piggy is still very selfish, Gonzo is still
trying to perform dangerous stunts, Animal still plays the drums, Rowlf
still plays the piano, and all the others are doing their thing. But,
let&#x27;s not forget the newest addition to this wonderful gang: Walter. If
you guys are wondering if whether or not he is worth watching, guess
what, he is worth it! He is a really likable character, who grew up
watching the muppets, and therefore has found them to be his place in
life. He is a very nice addition to the family, and I welcome him
aboard.<br /><br />Simply put, I can&#x27;t stress on how great this film is. Forget about
Twilight; The Muppets is where it&#x27;s at! Everything about this film is
great! Honestly, I don&#x27;t know why Frank Oz said that he felt like this
film did not focus on character development of the Muppets. Um Frank, I
believe that the Muppets have been around for around 35 years now; I
don&#x27;t think they need that much more character development. Simply put,
this movie is great. Kids will love the Muppets, and Adults will
remember why they loved the muppets when they were growing up. My only
complaint is that this movie should have been longer, but that&#x27;s barely
a complaint, since I enjoyed the movie so much that I will give it a
10/10. That&#x27;s right, a 10/10 for me! Welcome back, muppets!
