Nostalgia&#x27;s a big thing these days. In a cinematic climate scared of
taking risks, old TV shows, video games and books are given a revamp.
With this is mind, it was perhaps inevitable that The Muppets would
make a comeback. While they haven&#x27;t completely gone away, a slew of
kid-friendly straight-to-DVD films (after a brief return to TV in the
mid-90s) have seen them slip from the public eye. Fortunately, this new
film isn&#x27;t a cynical reboot or pointless nostalgia trip. With &#x27;How I
Met Your Mother&#x27; actor (and unabashed Muppet fan) Jason Segel writing
and starring, &#x27;The Muppets&#x27; is in safe hands.<br /><br />The plot is fairly basic: Gary (Segel), his long-term girlfriend Mary
(Amy Adams) and Gary&#x27;s Muppet &#x27;brother&#x27; Walter take a trip to the
Muppet Studios (after a touching flashback which shows the strong
lifelong bond between Gary and Walter and Walter&#x27;s love for the
Muppets). After eavesdropping on Tex Richman (Chris Cooper, enjoying
himself as the typical maniacal villain) planning to take over Muppet
Studios and dig for oil, they decide to find Kermit and convince him to
put on a telethon to raise $10 million and save the studio.<br /><br />For even the most cynical viewer, this film is a joy to watch. This
movie has something for everyone: there are numerous references to the
original series and previous movies, some upbeat song-and-dance
routines (which stay true to the original show&#x27;s vaudeville origins),
clever breaking-the-fourth-wall moments (when Kermit first refuses to
get the gang back together, Mary quips, &#x27;It&#x27;s going to be a short
movie&#x27;) lots of celebrity cameos and plenty of humour. Yes, the film
has the usual messages of believing in yourself and trying hard to
succeed, but it doesn&#x27;t descend into mawkishness.<br /><br />The usual gang are present: Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzy (who is still the
unfunniest funny bear around), Animal, Scooter, Gonzo, The Swedish Chef
(who has a bigger role in this film than in most of the previous films
combined, including a brief homage to &#x27;Scarface&#x27;), Sam the Eagle etc.
There&#x27;s even a new character: Eighties Robot, who is Kermit&#x27;s butler
and driver.<br /><br />There&#x27;s a wonderful sense of fantasy in this film: never once is the
logic of how Gary could have a Muppet brother questioned and the cast
breaks into song at a moments notice, even Richman has an impromptu rap
number. The most stunning example of this is during Kermit&#x27;s first song
in his mansion. As he walks past the old photos of the Muppets, they
come to life and sing with him, even The Swedish Chef is involved
(subtitled of course).<br /><br />It&#x27;s hard to find anything to dislike about The Muppets. It has a sense
of magic and wonder which is complemented with plenty of clever,
refreshingly innocent humour. It&#x27;s the epitome of the perfect family
film, satisfying both the nostalgic adult and wide-eyed child. If
anything, it proves that while they may have been briefly forgotten,
The Muppets have never stopped being loved. With a bit of luck, it may
even encourage a new generation to explore The Muppets for the first
time.
