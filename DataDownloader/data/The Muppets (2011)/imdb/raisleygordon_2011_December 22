If you really want to see the muppets make you smile and laugh, I
suggest revisiting their much earlier pictures instead. I also suggest
skipping the second adventure &#x22;The Great Muppet Caper&#x22;, being that it
is inferior to movies 1 &#x26; 3. Still, this new one is pleasant enough.
And why, after all these years (of about a handful of muppet movies),
would the filmmakers settle for just &#x22;The Muppets&#x22; as the title. You&#x27;d
think there&#x27;d be a better title than that, named as if this were their
first movie! As for the human characters, I&#x27;m not so sure they&#x27;re
fleshed out enough, especially the villain. I know it&#x27;s only a muppet
movie, but the villain needs to be slightly more interesting that
what&#x27;s offered here. However, Chris Cooper does bring more to this
character near the end of the movie. I also enjoyed the dance numbers.<br /><br />*** out of ****
