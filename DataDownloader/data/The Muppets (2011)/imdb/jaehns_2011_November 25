2011_November 25 
I am 35 and vividly remember watching The Muppet Show growing up. I
have watched all the previous Muppet Movies (some better than others)
and have to say that this installment did the Muppet Franchise proud! <br /><br />The movie stays very true to the original format. No 2011 whistles and
bells here, just the tried and true Muppets! Get the gang back
together, put on a show, Kermit and Miss Piggie at odds, musical
numbers, a few of the great songs (Manamana, Rainbow Connection), a few
great Muppet punches, and Fozzie&#x27;s old jokes...it&#x27;s all there! <br /><br />My kids (almost 8 and 9 years old) enjoyed it and wanted to pull out my
old DVD&#x27;s to watch more as soon as we got home.<br /><br />It was a little odd watching Amy Adams (who has been in some raunchy
comedies) and Jason Segel (who has ALSO been in some raunchy comedies)
in these roles, but after about 15 minutes I got used to it and started
to enjoy their innocent characters. They are definitely not the stars
of the show (Jack Black even upstages them and he&#x27;s only in the movie
for like 10 minutes total), but they aren&#x27;t intended to be. <br /><br />If you grew up with the Muppets, this is a MUST SEE. Expect to be
transported to your youth.
