It&#x27;s been a long time since Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, and the whole
Muppet gang all joined on screen together. It&#x27;s been nearly 12 years
since these lovable cast of characters made their last appearance in
&#x22;Muppet Treasure Island&#x22;. In a year of CGI-Pixar movies, and climatic
conclusions to life-long movie franchises, such as &#x22;Harry Potter&#x22;, it&#x27;s
time to make some room for some little fuzzy puppets that sing corny
songs, with their hearts tied in a &#x22;Rainbow Connection&#x22;. But I know
what you are wondering: &#x22;Do people still really care about the Muppets?
Are they still relevant to audiences?&#x22;&#x22;. Those two answers are &#x22;yes&#x22;!
&#x22;The Muppets&#x22; is a sweet, charming, hilarious, and innocent family film
that really stands out for all audiences, big and small. Jason Segel
and Amy Adams are just terrific as the love-struck duo of Gary and
Mary, a couple who go to Los Angeles for their 10-year anniversary.
Then, we meet a new Muppet named Walter, Gary&#x27;s brother who is a huge
Muppet fanatic, and he travels to L.A. with Gary and Mary to meet the
Muppets for the very first time. But they soon find out that an evil
tycoon, portrayed by Chris Cooper, is determined to destroy the Muppet
Theater to dig for the oil underneath. So, Walter, Mary, and Gary, then
team up with Kermit, to find all the other Muppets, and reunite them
all for their comeback show, to help save the theater. There were so
many wonderful things that I enjoyed about this movie. First of all, it
was super fun watching the Muppets again, and it made me feel like a
kid again. The laughs are family-friendly, and the humor is childish in
a special way. Also, I really like the way that the movie tries it&#x27;s
best to not be that corny. Whether they&#x27;re traveling by map, making
maniacal laughter, or ending up in a musical number, this movie knows
how to spot the clich&#xE9;s. But I mostly enjoyed all the fresh and
&#x22;up-to-beat&#x22; musical numbers, especially the powerful &#x22;Man or Muppet&#x22;
number that made me cry and sing in my seat. Those musical numbers were
catchy, enjoying, and fun to watch. This movie also has a really
powerful heart, and brings out a heartwarming message that even kids
will understand. The Muppets are still relevant today, and it will
start a range of brand new fans of these beloved characters. It was a
fresh return for this lovable cast of puppets. But I hope you can get
that &#x22;ma-na-ma-na&#x22; song out of your head after the closing credits.
It&#x27;ll help you decide whether you&#x27;re a real man or a real Muppet. &#x22;The
Muppets&#x22;, in my review, &#x22;a charming and innocent return of beloved
characters&#x22;.
