The Muppets &#x96; TRASH IT &#x22;Unless you&#x27;re not a Muppeteer&#x22; (C+) The
Muppetts are famous and I believe everyone in the world have seen them
in their childhood. They defiantly have significant part in growing up.
Now finally after long efforts of Jason Segel and Nicolas Stroller they
pull off a movie about the Muppeteer. The story and everything is
pretty good and work perfectly for the Muppets but as a grown man
watching the movie was a terrible experience. I do like a good children
movie with some humor but this one went too far with music and honestly
there was nothing funny about it. Jason Segel, Amy Adams and all
Muppets team did a great job but sadly I&#x27;m not an audience for it.
Special appearance by Emily Blunt, Selena Gomes, Zach Galifianakis,
Whoopi Goldberg, Alan Arkin, Jim Parsons, Rico Rodriguez and John
Krasinski were alright. So, if you&#x27;re not a Muppeteer then simply Trash
it.
