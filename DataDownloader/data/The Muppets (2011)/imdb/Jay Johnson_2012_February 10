You either love or hate the Muppet&#x27;s, I&#x27;m on the side of love. There
self aware comedy is one that can entertain children and adults alike
and it really is commendable.<br /><br />Though I&#x27;d love to give this film a 10/10 for pure enjoyment and its
uplifting spirit, it is by no means perfect. Some of the jokes are a
little forced and the exclusion of Rizo the rat I thought was a little
silly, as his and gonzo&#x27;s relationships is what made previous
instalments so fun.<br /><br />But these are minor grievances with a film that will fill you with joy
and is perfect to take kids too. The whole gang really haven&#x27;t lost
there sparkle, the film will not convert people who hate the Muppet&#x27;s,
but for those like myself who love them its a great addition to the
series.<br /><br />I feel there are some paths unexplored here and with the success of the
film, I hope more will be made. I personally would like to see another
Christmas carol or treasure island, but this is not necessary, because
if the writing is as concise as this keep doing them this way.
