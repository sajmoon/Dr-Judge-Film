I&#x27;m just the average viewer and never really write movie reviews so
that should say enough about liking the movie :) I probably went in
thinking it was going to be another flop in my eyes because for us in
our late 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s we know and love The Smurfs, The Chipmunks and
The Muppets as they originally were. I just thought this was going to
have meh&#x27; jokes, bad acting, a terrible storyline and made for todays
children. I was completely wrong.<br /><br />It had a pretty good storyline that supported everything we love about
the Muppets. In truth, I somewhat forgot things about the muppets until
I was watching them again and found myself laughing. My one criticism
would be some of the songs at the half way point (yes, there are songs
but they&#x27;re pretty short and most were created to have a laugh at). A
few of the songs I just found a little too cringe worthy to listen
to/watch and probably needed a bit more adult humour in there.<br /><br />My advice, if you were a fan of The Muppet Show, want a movie to relax
to and make yourself feel like an 80&#x27;s kid again then definitely give
The Muppets a go.<br /><br />I actually wish they&#x27;d bring back The Muppets Show now complete with
celebrities us adults adore, adult jokes and crazy muppets antics.
Primarily for the adults that loved them and if the kids of today like
it then good for them. :)
