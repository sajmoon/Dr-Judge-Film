The Muppets are my childhood in a nutshell; I was raised on reruns of
The Muppet Show and Muppet Babies. This new film was a flashback to my
past, and I loved it. The genuinely happy, funny, and little bit
dramatic musical that I know any Muppet fan would love is finally here.
Of course, the film has a fair amount of cameo celebrities, including,
but not limited to, Neil Patrick Harris, Whoopi Goldberg, Sarah
Silverman, and Jack Black<br /><br />Walter is a Muppet, well, more like a puppet not officially christened
a Muppet, whose best friend and brother figure is the human Gary (Jason
Segel). The two grew up together in Smalltown, USA, through school, boy
scouts, and reruns of The Muppet Show. Now Gary is a 30-something guy
who&#x27;s spent the last 10 years with his high school sweetheart Mary (Amy
Adams). Mary&#x27;s waiting for the day Gary proposes to her, and the two
are planning a trip to Los Angeles, but Mary is a tad hesitant that
Walter&#x27;s coming along.<br /><br />When the trio arrive in LA and visit the famous Muppet Studio, they
find that the Studio is abandoned and no one cares enough for the
Muppets anymore. Walter wanders away from Gary and Mary into Kermit the
Frog&#x27;s old office and learns of oil tycoon Tex Richman&#x27;s (Chris Cooper)
evil plan to tear down the Studio for the oil underneath. Walter tells
Gary and Mary that they need to find Kermit and raise the $10 million
needed to stop the destruction. The three find Kermit&#x27;s house and
inform him of the plan. Kermit is a little uncertain because he hasn&#x27;t
seen any of the others in years. Walter eventually convinces Kermit to
reunite the Muppets to save the Studio.<br /><br />What ensues is getting the gang back together: Fozzie is working as a
sleazy bar entertainer (just like in &#x22;The Muppet Movie&#x22;), Gonzo is a
powerful plumbing magnate, Animal is in an anger management clinic with
his mentor Jack Black, and Miss Piggy is a plus-size Vogue editor in
Paris. &#x22;Traveling by map&#x22; (the screen becomes an atlas and a line
journeys across the waters to Cannes, and the car comes out of the
water), the gang tries to convince Miss Piggy to return, who, still
bitter after a particular argument with Kermit years before,
reluctantly agrees.<br /><br />The Muppets is the perfect family comedy for the 2011 holiday season.
Muppet classics like &#x22;Rainbow Connection&#x22; and &#x22;Mahna Mahna&#x22; return,
along with new songs written by Flight of the Concords&#x27; Bret McKenzie
and writer/star Jason Segel; one of which is a rap performed by Chris
Cooper. It is the ultimate musical comedy and probably the best film
I&#x27;ve seen in 2011.
