I am really happy that they produced this film. It was long overdue.
Jason Segel had his heart in the right place when he took on this
movie.<br /><br />There are about 10 scenes that make it totally worth the ticket
price:(Chickens, Rainbow Connection, the rap song by Chris Cooper). The
&#x22;man or a Muppet&#x22; song was unexpectedly cute! A couple of scenes made
me want to hurl. (dance sequence at the beginning, make-up scene
towards the end). Fans of the series will be happy with the movie, I
think.<br /><br />I saw it with my 12-year-old, and he is now a fan. In fact, we&#x27;ve been
singing all of the pop songs on the radio in chicken. Overall, thumbs
up!
