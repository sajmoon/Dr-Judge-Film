When you take on an old license, and try to bring it back you have to
balance a few priorities. The old fans need to be respected, they were
the ones that supported the franchise in the first place and are your
primary demographic. Then there is the uninitiated. The potential new
fans who missed it the first time. You have to make sure they don&#x27;t
feel left out by a string of nostalgia and inside jokes. And so you
strive to update with respect, bring new people up to speed and still
speak to the fans. The Muppets made this old fan feel like he was going
home again, and my 8 year old daughter laughed all the way through and
came out exclaming it was &#x22;Awesome!&#x22; So there you have it, if you loved
the Muppets, or don&#x27;t know who they are but think you might like them,
this is a great movie for you. I guess if you know the Muppets but hate
them, then you should just wait for the DVD and watch the Statler and
Waldorf outtakes.
