In 1990, the world lost one of its greatest creators of perfect
childhood memories. In his short time on this earth, Jim Henson shared
his great craft with so many people through so many mediums. Among his
first creations an easy going dog, Rowlf, a witty frog that became his
trademark amphibian, Kermit, and a frackle that would later become
Gonzo the Great. These creations mixed with many others became the cast
of the great comedy variety show The Muppet Show known to many who grew
up in that era as one of the most iconic shows of its time.<br /><br />Then after three successful movies, an animated spin-off from the third
film, and Jim Henson&#x27;s tragic demise, the Muppets fell into disrepair.
Jim Henson Productions was passed around from owner to owner while it
limped along and a few less than stellar films were released along with
a failed revisit to the variety show routine (the absence of many of
the original characters may have had something to do with that). The
future appeared bleak.<br /><br />Until now.<br /><br />This movie is near perfect. It brings back the old crew with similar
antics as seen in the original Muppet Movie. It develops new muppets
well. It utilizes cameos for quick gags as the original films did. It
pays homage to the original Muppet Movie without trying to reinvent
what the muppets were. It even utilizes great comedic actors like Jack
Black, who plays an unwilling guest star to the new Muppet Show. the
music numbers are brilliant. If you had a childhood that was invested
in Jim Henson and you did not cry during the Rainbow Connection bit,
you have no soul.<br /><br />About the only downside was all the extreme close-up shots of muppets
attempting to interact with people and dancers in the background. The
director should have taken a better look at how muppets interacted with
people in The Muppets Take Manhattan. This will definitely have to be
addressed in future films. I hope this film brings back a solid
franchise.<br /><br />9.5/10
