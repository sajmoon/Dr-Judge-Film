I saw the advance screening on Saturday and it was fabulous. I am so
glad that the Muppets are back and better than ever like they did back
in their glory days(1976-1989). The Muppet Show was originally made for
adults to watch because of the dialogue and celebrity guests. The kids
loved to watch it just because of the puppets. I noticed as I was
watching it most of the adult audience were the ones laughing at the
jokes. I can&#x27;t wait for them to make a sequel and hopefully bring back
The Muppet Show on TV so we can see more musical acts(old &#x26; new), funny
sketches &#x26; celebrity guests. This movie is a real must see film. You&#x27;ll
love it like how it was back in 1976-1989.
