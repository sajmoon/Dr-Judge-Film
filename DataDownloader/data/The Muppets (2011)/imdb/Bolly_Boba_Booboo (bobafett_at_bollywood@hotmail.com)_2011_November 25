&#x27;The Muppets&#x27; caught my attention right from the moment I saw it&#x27;s
first promo, the promos were looking fantastic. The soundtrack was
ruling my Ipod, so watching &#x27;The Muppets&#x27; was a must for me! James
Bobin&#x27;s &#x27;The Muppets&#x27; is a film that works in bits and pieces. It has a
terrific first hour, but the second hour struggles. However, It&#x27;s
amazing music, Camera-work, the art of puppetry and a superb
performance by Steve Whitmire as Kermy makes this half-hearted fare a
decent one-time watch.<br /><br />Here&#x27;s something I want to say: Shiraz Ahmed&#x27;s screenplay is watertight
in the first hour. The suspense unfolds beautiful, it&#x27;s keeps you at
the Grip. But as soon the second hr beings, the screenplay becomes a
mess. The climax, especially, is the weakest link. It leaves no impact
whatsoever! A film that could&#x27;ve been a power-packed entertainer, sadly
ends up becoming a strictly one-time watch, as mentioned from the
beginning.<br /><br />Watch &#x27;The Muppets&#x27; for the pluses it has. But be ready to come out
half-hearted!
