This is a fun, fun movie for all ages. On the one hand, it&#x27;s absolutely
a love letter to &#x22;The Muppet Show&#x22; and the original Muppet movies, with
appearances by even the more obscure Muppet characters (some hidden in
the crowd shots). It&#x27;s a real treat for the longtime Muppet fanatic.<br /><br />And on the other hand, it&#x27;s a movie that promotes the old show
(available on DVD!) and makes the characters accessible to a new
generation of fans.<br /><br />The story starts with Jason Segel and his Muppet-like brother Walter,
and is more *about* the Muppets in a loving tribute kinda way. But once
Kermit, Fozzie, Gonzo, and gang show up, the Muppets themselves
(thankfully) take center stage. The human plot (involving Segel, Amy
Adams, and Walter) is fun in its way, but the best stuff
(understandably) involves Jim Henson&#x27;s fuzzy creations.<br /><br />Besides Kermit, Fozzie, Gonzo, and Miss Piggy, the Muppet cast includes
the Electric Mayhem, Bunsen &#x26; Beaker, Rowlf, Sam the Eagle, Swedish
Chef, Scooter, Statler &#x26; Waldorf, Bobo the Bear, Sweetums, Crazy Harry,
Beauregard, Lew Zealand, Uncle Deadly, Marvin Suggs and his Muppetones,
the Muppet Newsman, Link Hogthrob, Wayne &#x26; Wanda, Thog, Behemoth, Mahna
Mahna and the Snowths, and, in a refreshingly limited role, Pepe the
Prawn.<br /><br />The movie also introduces the new character of &#x27;80s Robot, who is
delightful (particularly for viewers old enough to get the jokes).<br /><br />Human Rashida Jones has an important role and does a good job acting
with the puppet cast. Likewise Jack Black is surprisingly effective
playing the victimized celebrity, a throwback to some &#x22;Muppet Show&#x22;
guest hosts. Chris Cooper is the villainous, Muppet-hating oil tycoon
in the classic Muppet cinematic tradition.<br /><br />The songs (by Flight of the Conchords&#x27; Bret McKenzie) are fun and goofy
and the movie is sprinkled with great celebrity cameos, retro flair,
and plenty of winks to the audience. (No one can break the fourth wall
like the Muppets.) There are even some touching, sentimental moments to
go along with the self-aware parody stuff. And the scenes at the very
end are a glorious celebration of Muppets, famous people, and fun! You
simply can&#x27;t leave THE MUPPETS (2011) in a bad mood.<br /><br />The movie captures the crazy, zany, absurd Muppet humor that fans love
and is utterly charming all the way through.
