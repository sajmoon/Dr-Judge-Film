The Muppets is a delightful feel good movie for kids and parents or any
with fond memories of the Muppet show on TV.It is never serious and has
surprisingly good writing and songs that are not forced as sometimes
happens in musicals like this.Like previous Muppet movies the main
muppet characters are gradually collected and introduced. Though sweet
to the point of irritation the live actors hold their own. My least
favorite muppets,Gonzo&#x27;s chickens,give probably the most hilarious
performance as they had the audience I viewed the film with and this
reviewer laughing to tears. There are many cameos and it deserved its
Oscar for best song.It&#x27;really too bad the Oscars don&#x27;t do the nominated
songs live anymore as this could have lightened up a really dry Oscar
night.
