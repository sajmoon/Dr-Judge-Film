WE WERE FIRST introduced to Jim Henson&#x27;s Muppets via the television
commercial. They had done some ads for a national dairy conglomerate;
whose local affiliate in Chicgoland was KRAML. &#x22;Funny things happen to
people who don&#x27;t drink KRAML Milk&#x22;....was a familiar and most amusing
tag-line. This was in the late &#x27;50&#x27;s to early &#x27;60&#x27;s.<br /><br />WELL, DUE TO the ensuing success on the JIMMY DEAN SHOW, SESAME STREET
and ultimately, THE MUPPETT SHOW, the band of Henson&#x27;s characters
became widely known. At one point, Circa 1978, we could find no one who
did not watch THE MUPPETT SHOW; which then aired in Chicago, Saturdays
at 6:30 P.M., over WGN TV, Channel 9.<br /><br />WELL, TIME HAS marched on and Mr. Henson has passed on; but the
characters were still popular and widely recognized, even to a
world-wide audience. With Muppett Productions now a part of what is the
Walt Disney Organization, their continued exposure and development is
assured. Kemit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Rolf and all have
climbed to the status of cultural icon and are virtually immortal.<br /><br />ALL THE WHILE, with all of the various movies and TV projects, Father
and Mother inevitably got involved in the process. We are of course
referring to Father Time and Mother Nature; as the kids who grew up
with THE MUPPETT SHOW reached young adulthood and in turn, &#x22;became
fruitful and multiplied!&#x22; The Muppett phenomenon was now being passed
on to another generation.<br /><br />BUT WHAT TO do as a cultural touchstone and to both lick off the &#x22;new
age&#x22; of Henson&#x27;s creations; while at the same time, exploiting the name
and thus translating this into a strong showing at the Box Office? (In
other words, $$$$$!) <br /><br />THE ANSWER WAS to stick with what had already been working, only more
so. The resulting project, simply titled THE MUPPETTS, brought back the
musical comedy format that had worked so well. Obviously, no expense
was spared and this picture was certainly as high quality of a product
as any previous outings.<br /><br />WE FIGURE THAT both Mr. Walt Disney and Mr. Jim Henson were done proud.
