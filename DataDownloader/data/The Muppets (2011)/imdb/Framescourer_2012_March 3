2012_March 3 
One expects a film that&#x27;s a cut above from the most famous collective
creation of Jim Henson. For all that The Muppets tries all sorts of
different twists on the reunion gig genre though, we can see them
coming. Adults groan at the in- and meta-jokes. For example Chris
Cooper&#x27;s pantomime baddie shouts out &#x27;maniacal laugh!&#x27; in place of
laughing and montage or illustrated sequences are introduced
self-consciously as such. The puppets themselves are an undying source
of fun but the children in my screening seemed strangely unmoved.
Perhaps there was too much nostalgia, or too much interaction with
adults, period.<br /><br />It&#x27;s slick but professionalism doesn&#x27;t take the place of the magic (we
see a tantalising glimpse of Peter Sellars on the original Muppet Show
early on). Adult cameos are averagely taken, Emily Blunt&#x27;s reprisal of
her secretary to Piggy&#x27;s Streep/Wintour a particularly flat
case-in-point. Worst of all, the songs are largely not just uninspired
but poor. The best part of the cinema experience was the excellent
prior Toy Story short. 4/10
