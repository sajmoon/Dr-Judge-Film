I wasn&#x27;t raised on Barbie dolls, or cartoons. I wasn&#x27;t in love with
Duck Tales or The Secret of Nimh (in fact it scared me senseless), but
I was raised to love The Muppets. Fozzie the Bear was a safe old friend
who always cheered me up, Kermit was my sense of justice and reason,
Miss Piggy was an exercise in the unrestrained Id, Gonzo was something
I didn&#x27;t and still don&#x27;t understand, but he&#x27;s blue and adorable! The
Muppets are incredibly precious to me. And I just LUCKED out, because
the newest Muppet movie was made by a fan who took all of that into
account and made a film that just celebrated the glory of the Muppets.
Sure there were moments of overkill, sure it sometimes got ridiculous,
but The Muppets is about more than just the Muppets. It&#x27;s about
yearning for something pure; something innocent without patronizing its
audience. This film was really clever, self aware with a great sense of
humor with a giant heart. Definitely see it!
