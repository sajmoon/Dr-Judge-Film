I love the muppets, i have for my entire life. But there is something
really a matter with this movie I don&#x27;t care what your political views
are and i don&#x27;t care. But why push ideas on people. &#x22;Evil Oil Baron&#x22; .
But enough of that.<br /><br />The movie is a solid 7. I found it funny and entertaining. I am a huge
muppets fan and thought they did a good job. It has that guy from
forgetting sarah marshall, and i like him. I did think that is was a
little serious for a muppet movie and not silly like it use to be<br /><br />I am just happy to see the muppets back. I really wish i could have
seen this movie in the theater
