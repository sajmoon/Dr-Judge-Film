I have fond memories of The Muppet Show from the 1970s and this project
does not even come close to it.<br /><br />The TV Muppet Show scored on zany, spontaneous humour. The best that
may be said of the attempts this movie makes of resurrecting this trait
is that I&#x27;ve had better times seeing paint dry on walls. And it wasn&#x27;t
just me either - I viewed this clunker of a movie with parents bringing
children of all ages and not a single laugh was heard throughout the
entire run, whereas Kermit and Co could be counted on to bring the roof
down when the TV show was running.<br /><br />A weak plot coupled to cardboard acting from the lead characters adds
to the dismal atmosphere.<br /><br />This is corporate Disney shamefully milking a once cherished trademark
for all it&#x27;s worth.<br /><br />Avoid this movie like the plague if you wish to preserve your fond
memories of The Muppets in their prime.
