I just got done reading the &#x22;hated it&#x22; reviews of The Muppets and not
one of them really explains why the nay-sayers hated it other than it
wasn&#x27;t true to their childhood memory of growing up with The Muppet
Show. My own experience of growing up with the muppets was less than
satisfying. Sure I loved them, but they were screened on Sunday night
and as soon as the show was over I had to go to bed. So for me the
muppets symbolised the end of the weekend and having to go to bed only
to wake up to yet another week of getting bullied at school. This movie
makes up for a lot of that!!! <br /><br />From the moment The Muppets started, my friend and I were laughing
appreciatively, as was everyone in the session I attended. But when the
muppet telethon started, the laughs went into hyperdrive and I found
myself barely able to breath from laughing so hard. It was also great
to see Jack Black actually being funny again, after a run of tepid,
unfunny &#x22;comedies.&#x22; Black plays the perfect fall guy and actually adds
to the hysteria. The whole thing is so masterfully executed. Then when
Kermit comes out and reprises the song he is most famous for, my eyes
welled, especially when he was joined by Miss Piggie and the rest of
the cast. I&#x27;d forgotten that the muppets do sincerity and poignancy as
effortlessly as they do their laughs. <br /><br />A few criticisms. I noticed there were lots of kids in my session and
most of them were pretty wriggly while the adults laughed like mad. I
don&#x27;t think Disney has been able to cater for all tastes with this
film. There are too many &#x22;talking head&#x22; moments to generally keep kids
engaged and they are too young to understand what nostalgia is, which
is heavily emphasised in the film. I loved all the songs but during
dance sequences the actors kept addressing the camera and then vaguely
looking off into the middle distance which became rather jarring. I
don&#x27;t mind actors breaking the fourth wall and directly addressing the
camera, but it needs to be done with conviction and purpose, both of
which seemed missing here and it kept pulling me out of the filmic
experience (I may be quite alone here). I also didn&#x27;t like seeing
Disney unashamedly plugging Cars 2 in one scene near the end of the
film. It was a shameless piece of cross-promotion. Having said this, I
really loved the Toy Story short at the start of the film - fast paced
and full of ingeniously hilarious toys.
