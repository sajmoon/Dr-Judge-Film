I never really watched the Muppet Show back in the day. So my review
stands on its own and is not influenced by memories of the old show. I
went along with the family and this was not my first choice for a
movie. Frankly, I entered the theater a little grumpy. I came out with
a smile on my face and humming the music. It&#x27;s funny and clever in a
way that adults can appreciate without any objectionable content at
all. Some jokes may go over the little ones heads, but it&#x27;s not because
they are risqu&#xE9;. Also, any movie that has Jack Black and Amy Adams in
it has to be good. There are a lot of cameos from familiar faces. One
in particular is genius -- I won&#x27;t spoil it for you, but it comes
during the &#x22;Man or Muppet&#x22; song.
