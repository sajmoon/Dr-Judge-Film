The Muppets have been broken up for years and have gone in their
separate directions. Then it becomes known that an evil oil tycoon
(Chris Cooper) is planning to buy the run down Muppets theatre, tear it
down and drill for oil underneath it. The Muppets all decide to hold a
telethon and make enough money to stop him from buying it.<br /><br />This movie has been a modest hit at the box office and that&#x27;s good to
see. Walt Disney bought the Muppets years ago and I expected the worst.
It&#x27;s good to see that they stayed true to the spirit of the Muppets
(VERY family friendly) and also (gently) poke fun at them too. The
movie is full of non-stop pop culture references and clever jokes (LOVE
the joke that follows Amy Adams looking into a thesaurus) and is
constantly breaking down the 4th wall and addressing the audience. Not
all the jokes work but, when they do, they&#x27;re GREAT! The biggest laugh
from my audience was when the Muppets kidnap Jack Black and Kermit&#x27;s
reaction:) There are also quite a few songs spread out but they&#x27;re VERY
short and pleasant but instantly forgettable. Adams stops the show with
her brief number in a diner.<br /><br />As for the acting...the Muppets are just like you remember them. There
are different people voicing them (of course) but they match the old
voices perfectly. There are also a lot of guest stars popping up in
small roles. Sarah Silvermans made me laugh out loud and Neil Patrick
Harris had the best line in the movie. Also I don&#x27;t like Jack Black at
all but I had to admit he was fun here. Segel and Adams play two of the
main characters and they work. Segel has a tendency to REALLY overact
but Adams is very good which is surprising considering the poor woman
has NOTHING to work with! Cooper has fun playing a slimy villain. Also
Rashida Jones is amusing playing a TV network executive.<br /><br />The original men who voiced the Muppets complained that this movie was
not true to the original Muppets but this is TOTALLY untrue. It matches
the original Muppet Show and is always entertaining. The only thing I
missed was Animal chasing a full grown woman around yelling, &#x22;Woman,
woman, woman&#x22;. But this was fun and entertaining and perfect for the
entire family. The kids in my audience were either dead quiet (because
they were into the movie) or roaring with laughter! Highly recommended.
