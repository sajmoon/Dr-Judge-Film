The Muppets movie is a enjoyable, funny movie. The moment I sat on my
seat and began watching the movie I felt like a kid again, that&#x27;s the
magic The Muppets have. The film is simple but entertaining, the rhythm
is slow but never boring. The music is great, with new songs and also
with the all- time Muppets classics from the TV show. The performances
were exactly the way they should be. Jason Segel and Amy Adams make a
perfect couple on screen. Chris Cooper is a very hilarious villain.
Watching Zack Galifianakis, Jack Black, Whoopi Goldberg, Jim Parsons
and many more prestigious well known artists with special appearances
was awesome.With this movie we can assure that good things never get
old and The Muppets are a prove of that. If you&#x27;re a Muppets fan,
definitely you will enjoy the movie, if not give it a try you won&#x27;t
regret it
