Once you get over the fact that it is possible for a human to have a
Muppet brother, then this movie is one hugely entertaining affair.<br /><br />Because you see, Jason Segel loves the Muppets so much that he decided
to write a script with Forgetting Sarah Marshall director Nicholas
Stoller, and have himself play the human protagonist whose Muppet
brother helps The Muppets reunite and save their old theatre from a
greedy old tycoon. Wait, we take that back. The protagonists in this 98
minute movie aren&#x27;t humans &#x96; how can we forget Kermit the Frog, Miss
Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo and the rest of the gang?<br /><br />Segel and Stoller&#x27;s script has The Muppets split up after their once
popular TV show stopped running. A depressed Kemit now lives in his own
mansion in Hollywood, Gonzo is the owner of a plumbing company named
Royal Flush (how in the world did anyone come up with that idea?),
Fozzie performs with a shady tribute band called The Moopets, while
Miss Piggy is living the life as a fashion editor at Vogue Paris.<br /><br />Enter Gary (Segel), who has a Muppet brother named Walter (Peter Linz,
who has been the voice of &#x22;Additional Muppets&#x22; in other Jim Henson
productions), and both of them are great Muppet fans. Gary brings his
girlfriend Mary (the wonderful Amy Adams) to Los Angeles for a romantic
getaway and brings Walter along. They discover an evil plot where an
oil magnate (the gleefully sinister Chris Cooper) plans to tear down
the beloved Muppet Theater and drill underneath for oil. The three then
go on a quest to bring The Muppets together to put on a show to raise
$10 million to repurchase the theater.<br /><br />The musical comedy film has a simple plot, and you know it&#x27;s not going
to disappoint kids with an unhappy ending. And who doesn&#x27;t love The
Muppets? It doesn&#x27;t matter whether you are a fan, because seeing
Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo doing their familiar antics (yes,
Miss Piggy will punch people off with her famous &#x22;hi yah!&#x22;, while Gonzo
will do his human cannon ball thing) will leave a smile on anyone&#x27;s
face. What about minor characters like Animal, Sam the Eagle, The
Swedish Chef, Statler and Waldorf? We aren&#x27;t forgetting the rest of The
Muppets whose names we aren&#x27;t very sure, but look somewhat familiar.
This bunch of puppets is a hoot to fans and new audiences alike.<br /><br />The humans may not be the focus here, but look out for fun cameo
appearances by familiar faces like Alan Arkin, Emily Blunt, Feist,
Whoopi Goldberg, Selena Gomez, Neil Patrick Harris, Ken Jeong, Zach
Galifianakis and Jack Black as an abducted celebrity.<br /><br />The musical numbers are wholesomely fun &#x96; from new songs like &#x22;Life&#x27;s a
Happy Song&#x22;, &#x22;Pictures in My Head&#x22; and &#x22;Man or Muppet&#x22;, to familiar
tunes like &#x22;Mahna Mahna&#x22;, &#x22;Rainbow Connection&#x22; and the beloved &#x22;The
Muppet Show Theme&#x22;, which will have you reminiscing the old days (if
you grew up watching them on TV).<br /><br />It also helps that the James Bobin directed movie boasts of some very
clever and truly funny moments. Take for example how the gang
introduces the muppets in &#x22;montage&#x22; style, and how they travel across
the world &#x22;by map&#x22;. You could see this coming with the hilarious
publicity online stunt involving parody trailers (The Pig with the
Froggy tattoo, anyone?) the movie had leading up to its opening.<br /><br />That said, there are also some very heartfelt moments which tug at your
heartstrings. You will want to celebrate the Muppet spirit, one that is
always, for the lack of a better word, happy.
