Like many people, the Muppets were a big part of my childhood. I
watched Sesame Street in the morning, Muppet Babies in the afternoon,
and Muppet Show reruns in the evening. The Muppets are a national
institution in the United States and beloved the world over. As most
know, they came from the mind of Jim Henson. Henson&#x27;s sense of humor
was that perfect balance of the crass and the innocent, the surreal and
real, the sly and the whimsical. He knew how to entertain kids and
adults simultaneously, an uneasy feat most in the film and television
industry can&#x27;t master. In short, Henson knew how to make family
entertainment. That&#x27;s why the vast majority of products worked and
remain staples in American culture two decades after his death.<br /><br />After Henson died, the Muppet name didn&#x27;t hold the same weight.
Henson&#x27;s presence was missing in the Muppets&#x27; last full length feature
&#x22;Muppets in Space&#x22; and it showed. For a decade, the Muppets were
virtually out of sight and, barring die hard fans, out of mind. Then in
2009, the Muppets went viral with their rendition of Bohemian Rhapsody
and re-entered the consciousness of the general public. With 20 million
hits plus, the video was an obvious smash but it was only a lead up to
a new full-length feature, released two year to the day of the Muppets
Bohemian Rhapsody video.<br /><br />By the time I put my money down and got my ticket, I knew the film was
in good hands. I&#x27;ve seen many of the aforenamed videos on YouTube and
that wry, yet goofy, Muppet-esque humor was there. I knew if the same
people involved with the video made the film, it was going to be a
treat.<br /><br />The film&#x27;s main protagonist is Walter, a puppet living in a human
world. His brother, Gary (played by co-writer Jason Segal) has always
been there for him. The two are close to the point of borderline
codependency and even well into their thirties, they&#x27;ve lived under the
same roof. Walter is a full blown fan of the Muppets, and has been
since his adolescence.<br /><br />At the same time, Gary is in a very, very long term relationship with
school teacher Mary (played by Amy Adams) who longs for the day when
Gary finally proposes and cuts the emotional, inch-long chord binding
Gary and his brother. Their relationship is further strained when Gary
brings Walter along with him and Mary on a trip to Los Angeles, a trip
that was supposed to be a romantic getaway for Gary and Mary. Gary and
Mary take Walter on a trip to, what Gary considers, hallowed ground:
the Muppet Studios. What was once a small, though busy, film studio has
since become a dump since the Muppets went their separate ways. While
sneaking into Kermit&#x27;s old office, Gary learns that an oil baron plans
on tearing down the lot and digging for that sweet, sweet black gold.
The three vacationers find the residence of a certain Kermit the Frog.
After Walter, Gary and Mary explain the situation to Kermit (and a
lovely musical number) the plucky little frog sets out to find his
friends and save a place they once called home.<br /><br />The film is filled with so many celebrity cameos, sight-gags, sneaky
jokes, and solid musical numbers that ranged from hilarious to
touching, it would take more than the allotted 1000 word limit to
explain it all. Then again, isn&#x27;t that was a Muppet movie is all about?
The pacing is quick and the run time is short, and yet the characters
were able to develop beautifully. The movie routinely broke the fourth
wall and made numerous references to pop culture, but didn&#x27;t force
jokes as other family films are wont to do. The Muppets even had a few
good laughs at themselves through the film and yet they reminded the
audience of what made them such a beloved entity. It was obvious Jim
Henson&#x27;s hand was over &#x22;The Muppets&#x22; (and if one looks carefully, they
will see Henson&#x27;s face in the movie twice). This film is a gem of this
autumn/winter season and is a must see for Muppet fanatics and newbies
alike.
