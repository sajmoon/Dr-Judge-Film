After 12 years since their last theatrical appearance, Jim Henson&#x27;s
felt creations are back and they still have what it takes to greatly
entertain.<br /><br />The movie concerns the groups&#x27; biggest fan, a puppet named Walter, who
finds kindred spirits in them when he feels alone among the humans of
his home town in Smalltown USA. Taking a trip with his brother Gary
(Jason Segal) and Gary&#x27;s girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams, who fits right
in), he finds Muppet Studios abandoned and about to be destroyed by oil
baron Tex Richman (Chris Cooper). Thus the trio set out to reunite the
disbanded Muppets and save the theater.<br /><br />It brings back memories of the Muppet Show and 80s movies, complete
with allusions &#x26; references to the gang&#x27;s early works and appearances
by obscure &#x26; forgotten Muppet characters of old. There are musical
numbers varying size, gratuitous celebrity cameos, showbiz jokes, and
some good old fashioned fourth wall breaking (&#x22;Wow, that was an
expensive looking explosion! I can&#x27;t believe we had that in the
budget.&#x22;)There&#x27;s slapstick, silliness, and some stirring moments (which
I won&#x27;t spoil here). I also appreciated the commentary about the
Muppets&#x27;unfortunate standing in the world, which might be a little
annoying to Muppet fans, but is sadly true and needed to be addressed
(I can imagine a show like &#x22;Punch Teacher&#x22; being very popular if it was
real). Hopefully this movie can change that, if just to a certain
extent.<br /><br />I&#x27;ll admit that some the jokes fall flat, a couple of the numbers are
fairly unnecessary, and some the cameos are just pointless. But after
the dull, near lifeless &#x22;Muppets From Space&#x22; that almost killed the
franchise and several uneven (at best) TV movies, it&#x27;s good to see the
gang back on the big screen again. Especially when they&#x27;re in such
great form after so long.
