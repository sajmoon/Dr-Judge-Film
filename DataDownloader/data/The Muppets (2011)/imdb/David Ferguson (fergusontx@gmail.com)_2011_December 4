Greetings again from the darkness. Since I recently selected an
animated film as my favorite movie of the year (Toy Story 3), it is to
be expected that I would find the first Muppets movie in 12 years to be
quite enjoyable. Actually I went in with high expectations since the
director is James Bobin, who was the creator of &#x22;Flight of the
Conchords&#x22;, one of my favorite cult TV shows. Although Bret and
Jermaine don&#x27;t make an appearance (though Bret McKenzie does write the
songs), there is still loads of fun to be had.<br /><br />Jason Segel and Amy Adams star, along with Chris Cooper, Rashida Jones,
Jack Black and a long list of celebs who I won&#x27;t name here ... it&#x27;s
much more fun to spot them as they arrive on screen. The old gang is
back, including Kermit, Miss Piggy, Gonzo (now owner of plumbing
company Royal Flush), Fozzie Bear (in a casino act), Animal (straight
out of Anger Management) and of course, my favorites, Statler and
Waldorf.<br /><br />There are a couple of tributes to the genius that was Jim Henson,
creator of the Muppets. You will notice a poster of him outside the
studio and a photograph on the wall of Kermit&#x27;s office. No real need to
go into the story, but I think most will be impressed not just with the
cameos and songs, but also the depth of the script. There is a reason
for the Muppets revival, and I am very happy to see the band is back
together!
