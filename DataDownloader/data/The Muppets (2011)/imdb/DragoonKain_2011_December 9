This was the best Muppet Movie since 1981&#x27;s The Great Muppet Caper,
which is saying a lot, because I hold that film in very high regard.<br /><br />The Muppets have been rather hit and miss since Jim Henson passed away.
The Muppet Show was originally started by Henson and Oz as a more adult
oriented, yet still family friendly comedy variety show as an outlet
for gags and bits that wouldn&#x27;t work on Sesame Street. It worked too,
both kids and adults loved the show, and the first three films are
classics in their own right. But, sometime in the 80s, The Muppets
started to cater more towards Kids rather than adults. The Muppet
Babies were first introduced in the third feature film which eventually
spawned its own series. Henson then sold the franchise to Disney and
sadly died shortly thereafter. It seems that, after the success of
Muppet Babies, Disney decided to continue to move The Muppets in a more
kid oriented direction ... one with a decidedly Disney flavor to it.
This didn&#x27;t really help the Muppets legacy in the long term. Kids grow
up, and eventually grow out of kid shows and movies. And with very
little, if any, appeal to adult audiences, The Muppets were soon
forgotten by the generation who grew up in the 90s and 2000s.<br /><br />But the generation that that grew up in the 70s and 80s had not
forgotten the old Muppets, in fact they missed them dearly. Jason Segel
is one of those people, and it is clear from this film that his
enduring love of The Muppets and the influence they had on him as a
child, was the driving force behind this movie.<br /><br />This is a comeback movie. The Muppets start off in a bad way. People
have forgotten them, their abandoned studio is about to be torn down,
and they just aren&#x27;t popular anymore. This is reflecting the actual
situation The Muppets franchise was in at the time they were making the
movie. And thus the plot lends itself to fourth wall jokes that were so
prevalent in the early films.<br /><br />It is, for the most part, a return to form. This is old school muppet
humor at its best. You have the silly and catchy musical numbers, mixed
in with a bit of sincere songs, celebrity cameos, fourth wall jokes,
pop culture humor, a self aware plot that frequently pokes fun at
itself, Fozzie&#x27;s bad jokes, Statler and Waldorf&#x27;s heckling, a Kermit
and Miss Piggy romance plot, and just general wackiness and slapstick.<br /><br />Still, as similar as it is to the old Muppet formula, it&#x27;s also quite
different. After Disney took over, human characters often played larger
roles in the Muppet films. That is the case with this one. In fact,
much of the plot and humor in this film is not centered around the
muppets at all, but are centered around the two human characters and
the new muppet. While some may be disappointed by this change, I have
to disagree and say that, for this film, it works and works quite well.
Still, it&#x27;s clear that Disney doesn&#x27;t have much confidence in The
Muppets holding the film together on their own, like they did in the
original (and best) Muppet Movie.<br /><br />As a result there are times where the movie feels less like a Muppet
Movie and more like a tribute to the Muppets. In some ways this is the
film&#x27;s strength, in other cases it is a weakness. Also, some of the
bits in the second half seem a bit awkward and fall flat, often on
purpose, but usually it isn&#x27;t worth the payoff. Nevertheless, this film
hits on an emotional and nostalgic level, especially for those who grew
up with The Muppets. There were times when I actually felt a tear come
to my eye. It&#x27;s that moving.<br /><br />The film&#x27;s success so far has been warranted, and I&#x27;m hopeful that
Disney will do the right thing and green light &#x22;The Cheapest Muppet
Movie Ever Made&#x22;, a project Henson and Oz had been pushing for since
1985. There were even plans to make it in 2009, but the project was set
aside for this film instead. Hopefully, this last idea by Jim Henson
will be the next sequel, the premise certainly looks like it has
potential.
