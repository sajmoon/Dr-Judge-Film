In order to prevent ruthless oil tycoon Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) from
tearing down their old studio, everyone&#x27;s favourite felt-faced
performers reunite and put on a fund-raising telethon, aided by
muppet-like super-fan Walter (voiced by Peter Linz), his all-human
brother Gary (Jason Segel), and Gary&#x27;s long-term girlfriend Mary
(gorgeous Amy Adams).<br /><br />The Muppets&#x27; plot is pure show-business clich&#xE9;, the script even going
so far as to ensure that all the characters have learnt a valuable
life-lesson by the closing credits, but this film isn&#x27;t just another
tired and predictable Hollywood cash-in&#x97;it&#x27;s a very clever, surreal,
and consistently inventive meta-movie, a fun homage to one of the best
loved TV series of the 70s. Crammed with off-the-wall humour, hugely
entertaining song and dance routines (including the Oscar-winning Man
or Muppet), chickens, star cameos, and hilarious visual gags, this is
one film that even the presence of Jack Black couldn&#x27;t stop me from
enjoying.
