The best way to see a good movie is to go into it knowing as little
about it as you can so I try not to include details about the movies in
my reviews. If the movie sucks then I&#x27;m not shy about including details
and/or spoilers.<br /><br />I loved the Muppet show as a child but this was my first time watching
a Muppet movie and I must say I enjoyed it. I&#x27;m not a big fan of
musicals so the song numbers in the movie did bug me but the rest of
the movie overshadowed that horror so it is all good. In fact, I
thought I was going to hate this movie because it starts off with some
crappy song number but once you see the frog this movie gets going. I
also love the fact that this movie is aimed at people that grew up in
the 80s, I got a kick out of that. 80s Robot rocks, btw.. you&#x27;ll see.
This is just a warm and fuzzy joyfest of a movie. You&#x27;ll love it. I
hope they don&#x27;t make a sequel to this, at least not for a while. Are
the Muppets back? The answer is yes however the question is do we want
them to stick around? I say that because this movie is more or less
about a bunch of old friends coming together to do something or other
however they are older and wiser. Funny how a Muppets movie can be so
emotional but that is why this movie was so engaging.
