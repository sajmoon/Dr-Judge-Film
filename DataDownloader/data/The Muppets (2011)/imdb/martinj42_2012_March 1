Just watched this on a flight to Australia, so plenty of time to think
over things, but basically what was the point of making this movie? I
could understand the Gary character as a big Muppet fan and getting to
finally see the old studios, but the brother Walter did NOT fit and
girlfriend was really quite strange (fixing a 12v starter in the
classroom?). Why don&#x27;t they just admit Walter is a puppet rather than
try to treat him like a human, or am I missing some sort fantasy angle
on the whole thing? Or am I not PC enough? It seems to me that the use
of all the old characters (I must admit very well done) was really
rather wasted when the whole thing had very little plot. At least the
celebrity they got was a good choice!
