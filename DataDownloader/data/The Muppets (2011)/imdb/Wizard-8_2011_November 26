I have been a fan of the Muppets since I started watching &#x22;The Muppet
Show&#x22; as a child during the 70s. Though after &#x22;Muppets From Space&#x22;, I
was starting to wonder if the magic had gone. Thankfully, this movie
shows there is still life in this franchise. Although it will help if
you&#x27;re familiar with the Muppets, there&#x27;s still enough in this movie to
tickle and warm the heart of those unfamiliar with the characters.
Personally, I was extra thrilled by the fact that they brought back
Rowlf - my favorite Muppet - and gave him some lines of dialogue. In
fact, many of the classic characters are resurrected and play a part in
the movie.<br /><br />As much as I enjoyed the movie, I did have two minor quibbles:<br /><br />(1) The movie never really examines the issue of why the Muppets had
disbanded. They split up years ago... but why? It&#x27;s a noticeable gap in
the narrative.<br /><br />(2) Some of the Muppets don&#x27;t sound quite like they did years ago. Now,
I realize some of the classic Muppet performers have died, and that
Frank Oz couldn&#x27;t be coaxed out of retirement, but I think they could
have searched harder for voice actors who sounded more like the
original performers.<br /><br />But apart from those minor flaws, the movie is definitely worth seeing,
whether you are 8 or 80.
