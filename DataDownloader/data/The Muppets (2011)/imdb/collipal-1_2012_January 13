The Muppets have been an important part of my life. Their &#x22;golden age&#x22;
is identified to the &#x27;70s (when the successful TV programme The Muppets
Show was transmitted), and even though I hugely enjoyed that period of
the characters, I think I enjoyed them even more during the &#x27;80s, when
the TV ecosystem was still flexible enough to hold such unpredictable
and experimental series as Storyteller, Dog City and The Jim Henson
Hour. However, two tragedies came during the &#x27;90s...Jim Henson
(1936-1990)&#x27;s death and the subsequent acquisition of the Muppets by
the emporium Disney. Since then, we had only seen them in some mediocre
movies (such as Muppets from Space and Muppet Treasure Island) and TV
specials (such as It&#x27;s a Very Muppet Christmas Movie) in which Henson&#x27;s
&#x22;voice&#x22; was completely absent (literal and figuratively). In summary,
it seemed that the spirit from the Muppets had been diluted by the
corporative influence from their new owners.<br /><br />Fortunately, co-screenwriters Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller, along
with director James Bobin, could reunite enough influence in order to
create a new film, simply titled The Muppets, with the objective of
resurrecting the characters, introducing them to a new generation and
bringing their original sense of humor back. And it is a pleasure for
me to say that The Muppets could perfectly achieve everything it
proposed to itself, and it left me wanting to see them more frequently,
as long as this same level of energy, humor and &#x22;muppetosity&#x22; can be
kept.<br /><br />The screenplay from The Muppets is hugely entertaining and very funny.
Besides, the classic concept of &#x22;let&#x27;s save the theater&#x22; works
perfectly in order to motivate the characters, create drama and keep us
in suspense till the end. On some way, I missed some original voices
(unfortunately, Frank Oz refused to participate in this movie, and some
of the classic performers, such as Richard Hunt, are currently
retired), but the puppeteers who replaced them show a lot of &#x22;spark&#x22;
and enthusiasm. What is more, there are various musical numbers in this
film, and they are amazingly an integral part of the narrative.<br /><br />In conclusion, The Muppets made me laugh, made me cry, and resurrected
my taste in Henson&#x27;s legacy, which is in good hands for the first time
in many years. Personal anecdote: before the movie started, I saw the
trailers of family films which are soon to be released. They were
animated by computer, they looked identical, and they sold the same
rancid humor, the same pre-fabricated characters and the same frantic
action in order to distract the children. On the opposite, The Muppets
does not have too much action, it has minimum special effects, and its
characters possess much more life and personality than any digital
creation. Its sense of humor is intelligent and does not insult the
spectator, the emotional moments feel honest, and it is definitely the
best comedy I have seen in various years. In summary, a magical and
completely unforgettable film experience.
