Warm, charming and funny, just like the Muppets I remember from my
childhood. I&#x27;m not often one for musicals, but this one - aided by the
brilliant combination of fuzzy puppet singers and Flight of the
Conchords composition - hits all the right notes. It&#x27;s funny without
nudging into blue territory, a talent that&#x27;s becoming more scarce by
the minute, with a heartwarming reunion storyline that slowly
reintroduces the cast and reminds us why we grew to love them in the
first place. Loaded with unexpected cameos and sly winks at the
troupe&#x27;s long history, it&#x27;s clear that a lot of love went into the
making of this picture; the screen positively resonates from beginning
to end. Though I was hesitant to revisit this old territory at first,
by the final act I was grinning warmly and nodding right along, utterly
entranced.
