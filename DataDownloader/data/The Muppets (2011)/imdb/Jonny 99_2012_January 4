No greater testament to the singular genius of Jim Henson could be made
than to have a company of Disney&#x27;s stature purchase his once very
successful Muppet property and then not be sure how to make it
entertaining. The major problem with the film, beyond Henson no longer
being around to make it work, is a lack of trust of the source
material. Based on the success of the &#x22;A Night at the Museum&#x22; movies,
Amy Adams is brought in to star along Jason Segel as the human
protagonists of what worked previously because of a dearth of human
characters. Adams and Segel work through a love triangle over top of
the relationship problems of Kermit and Ms. Piggy which should have
been the romantic &#x22;B&#x22; plot (the main plot being an effort to save the
old Muppet theater. Another major problem is an over-reliance of
piercing the fourth wall which is used successful by &#x22;The Simpson&#x22; and
&#x22;Simpsons&#x22; knockoff shows by Seth MacFarlane largely because they are
used sparingly. When nearly every scene includes either a reminder you
are watching a movie or a pointless celebrity cameo the trope quickly
loses its power to charm. Henson did use the celebrity cameo but he
realized the entertainment value was in their suddenly appearing in
mundane parts (only the Sarah Silverman cameo is true to the original
spirit of the franchise). Henson would have also cleaned up the &#x22;2nd
draft&#x22; feeling of the film particularly easily forgettable song and
dance numbers. The most egregious of these is Amy Adams clearly
improving her way through a dreadful tune called &#x22;Party of One.&#x22;
Suffice to say they won&#x27;t sell a lot of soundtracks. This
not-quite-finished feeling to the songs and script reverberates loudly
through the plot which includes the idea that a wealthy oil tycoon
plans to demolish the old Muppet theater to drill beneath it...in the
middle of Los Angeles (you know the largest city in the most
environmentally restrictive U.S. state). Why not make him a wealthy
real estate tycoon looking to build condos - that would have made
sense. In short, much like &#x22;The A-Team&#x22;, &#x22;Dukes of Hazzard&#x22;, &#x22;GI Joe&#x22;,
&#x22;Brady Bunch&#x22; and other television of the late 70s, 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s, the
muppets don&#x27;t lend themselves well to resurrection - let it rest in
peace.
