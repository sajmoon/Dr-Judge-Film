The funny and fuzzy sensation of a generation returns for one last
hurrah in &#x22;The Muppets&#x22;, a warm hearted musical comedy that acts less
like a brand relauncher and more like a grand final act to a classic
franchise. For years, the Muppets have appeared in TV holiday specials
and movies but this movie returns to the original series that first
jumpstarted the Muppes to fame: the 1976 Muppets Show. Self referencing
humor, witty comedy and familiar characters pay the ultimate tribute
not just to a well loved franchise but to the Muppets fandom as well.
Why else would the main character be a muppet fanboy? <br /><br />Meet Walter, the ultimate muppet fanboy (who is also portrayed as a
muppet) who lives with his human brother Gary in &#x22;Smalltown&#x22; USA. The
two grew up together and have been fans of the muppets ever since The
Muppet show first aired in the 70s. One day Gary plans a trip to Los
Angeles with his girlfriend Mary. Walter jumps at the opportunity to
tag along and visit the muppet theatre, much to the dismay of Mary who
was hoping for some private time with her boyfriend. But instead of
seeing the muppet theatre of his childhood, Walter comes face to face
with harsh reality: the muppets have disbanded, the theatre is in ruins
and a greedy tycoon is looking to buy the location and tear down the
place of Walter&#x27;s childhood dreams. Undaunted, Walter tries to reunite
the Muppets for one final show in order to raise the money needed to
buy back the theatre.<br /><br />Cute, heartwarming and absolutely nostalgic, &#x22;The Muppets&#x22; only
downside is that it feels like two different shows pasted together; on
one hand you have the plot thread about the Muppets getting back
together for a final show, and on the other you have this Disney styled
buddy romance triangle between Greg, his girlfriend and his brother
Walter. The tone between those two plot threads varies quite a bit,
with the trio being like something out of &#x22;Mary Poppins&#x22;. All
saccharine and happy song and dance.<br /><br />On the flipside, the tale of former muppet leader Kermit the Frog
getting the gang back together is played more tragically and, believe
it or not, more realistically. Yes he is a cloth puppet and so are the
other Muppets, but this movie never panders to the kids. What we have
is a story that adults can enjoy as well. The years have not been kind
to the Muppets and Kermit is a performer past his prime, divorced from
his former love Miss Piggy, with only memories and mementos of his
glory days. As he tours the world looking for his friends, he sees the
sorry state some of them have landed in. This story thread is both
emotionally moving and ultimately satisfying. What&#x27;s more, it would
surprise you how vividly cloth and stick puppets emote. There is a
certain warmth and realism present that even the best computer graphics
animation cannot replicate. Despite having new voice actors, these are
the same lovable characters from the original show, quirky
personalities and all.<br /><br />Throughout the movie, the ongoing tension between Walter and Gary
references the real life balance between childlike passion and adult
responsibilities. With its self referencing narrative, the movie works
as a parable about growing up and taking on new priorities in life;
something many fans of the original muppets show would have personally
experienced.<br /><br />But perhaps the main attraction is the movie&#x27;s witty humor. Not even
the fourth wall is safe as the characters lampoon everything from High
school Musical style dance numbers to a time saving montage sequence.
It is clever, well written comedy that pokes fun at itself and other
shows. So hilarious that it has to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />The Muppets covers all grounds for a good movie experience. The most
human of characters portrayed by inhuman looking cloth puppets, cast
chemistry that tugs on the heart strings and a simple story that anyone
can relate to. Throw in some catchy songs and celebrity cameos with a
healthy dose of nostalgia for those who loved the original Muppets Show
and you have a sure winner that appeals to fans new and old alike. And
once the curtain comes down, you would be clamoring for an encore. Here
is a true tribute to a timeless classic that brings a childhood icon to
a whole new generation of viewers. Let us give a standing ovation to
&#x22;The Muppets&#x22;, definitely one of the must watch movies of the year.
