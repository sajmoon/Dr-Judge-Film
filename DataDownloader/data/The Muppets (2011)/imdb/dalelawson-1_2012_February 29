Having not seen any episodes of The Muppet Show (Writ. Jim Henson,
1976- 1981), The Muppets (Dir. James Bobin, 2012) is the third Muppet
production I have seen; with The Muppet Christmas Carol (Dir. Brian
Henson, 1992) and Muppet Treasure Island (Dir. Brian Henson, 1996)
preceding it. For this reason I cannot personally say I have the same
respect and admiration for the Muppet franchise, having not shared my
childhood with their TV show.<br /><br />From the very start of the film we are expected to believe that Gary&#x27;s
(Jason Segel) brother Walter, who is a puppet, is actually his brother
and no-one has ever questioned that they look completely different. I
am, of course, willing to accept this reality as I am watching The
Muppets. This film knows it is a film, and therefore gets away with
bending reality. The story follows the characters of Gary, Walter and
Mary (Amy Adams) as they travel to Los Angeles to reunite the Muppets
before their studio is sold to an &#x22;evil&#x22; oil tycoon. This story,
although very basic, is heart-warming and a satisfying return for the
Muppets.<br /><br />Some of the jokes are childish, but none of them are humourless. The
Muppets relies upon its alternative and amusing characters to drive the
film forward for an hour and forty-five minutes. This time is filled up
with fantastic anecdotes from Statler and Waldorf, the two balcony
hecklers; a Muppets TV Telethon full of comical gags and of course an
enormous amount of songs and musical montages. These songs are
fantastic! The Oscar winning &#x22;Man or Muppet&#x22;, composed by Flight of the
Concords&#x27; Bret McKenzie, was a joy to watch with its incredible
editing, celebrity cameos and emotional lyrics. The other songs
throughout The Muppets were just as entertaining, apart from the few
short songs that felt unneeded.<br /><br />The characters of Kermit and Walter have the most facial expression
variation out of all the Muppets, and perhaps all the actors within the
film. The human characters show less emotion to enable the audience to
relate more to the Muppets than to Segal or Adams, or at least I hope
this is the reason they present very underdeveloped and flat
characters.<br /><br />One real problem I had with the film was the over excessive, and
sometimes very visible, use of CGI, Computer-Generated Imagery. As they
are using puppets, rather than animated characters, I had only expected
a small amount of computer imagery and was shocked and disappointed at
the amount of noticeable special effects there were. It seemed almost
like the Muppets suffered the same budgetary restrictions as they do in
The Muppets.<br /><br />I am predicting that after the success of this film, The Muppet Show is
likely to return to our screens in the near future. Whether or not
Kermit will be the protagonist is questionable as Walter has a similar
body shape and facial expressions to Kermit. Could the Muppets be
considering replacing the little green frog?<br /><br />Having only seen two Muppet movies prior to this I was pleasantly
surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. It does suffer some
terrible use of CGI and it is 20 minutes too long. These faults aside,
this movie was fantastic. A basic narrative driven by Kermit, Miss
Piggy and the newly introduced character of Walter help push the
Muppets back into the hearts and minds of audiences throughout the
world. My prediction still stands, keep your eyes open for another
Muppet movie or the return of The Muppet Show.<br /><br />http://dalelawsonreviews.tumblr.com/
