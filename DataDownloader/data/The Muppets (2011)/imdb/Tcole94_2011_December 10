I remember watching the Muppets as a child,I have a particularly good
memory of the Muppet&#x27;s in Space. This doesn&#x27;t fail to make me regress
and just enjoy the movie. It also reminds me of how movies aimed at
children can be enjoyed by anyone.<br /><br />Of course the special effects are limited as there are puppets in the
movie, but they are used very well, lets just say it is the exact
opposite to Team America in reference to the use of puppets.<br /><br />Kermit being the main star is bound to have great lines and makes you
laugh and have a good time. However Miss Piggy provides all the sass in
the movie and in my opinion that is much funnier.<br /><br />The cast are good, Jason Sagel is great, he can do any comedy acting he
wants, from How I met you mother, to Forgetting Sarah Marshal. He just
adds to the excellence of the movie and he really completes the
ensemble.<br /><br />You cant really faultier the directing, it is lacking at some points,
but thats what makes the Muppets special.<br /><br />Overall I thought it was a great movie and didn&#x27;t fail to live up to my
high expectations.
