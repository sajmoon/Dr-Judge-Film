There basically was no reason for the Muppets to disappear from the
field for as long as they did. They never lost any of their
entertainment value or started to become outdated in any way. So I&#x27;m
glad they are being brought back again, in this, more or less, reboot
of the franchise. It introduces the magic and the characters to a new
generation and it brings everything back, so many generations grew up
with in the past and shall grow up with in the future as well,
hopefully.<br /><br />In that regard this movie works on both levels. It&#x27;s a perfectly fun
movie for kids, who aren&#x27;t familiar yet and a nostalgic trip for those
who remember the Muppets from the past.<br /><br />The world seemed ready and desperate for another good Muppet movie
again and people seem to be mostly loving this movie because of
nostalgic, which however seems to make most people blind of all the
problems that this movie still has.<br /><br />This is not the Muppet movie that made me laugh the most. It&#x27;s also not
the one with the best written script, songs or cast in it. Therefore it
also isn&#x27;t my favorite Muppet movie. It&#x27;s obviously good entertainment
and fun all but it&#x27;s still too weak and flawed of a movie to consider
this one of the year&#x27;s most entertaining ones.<br /><br />I have always really liked the Muppets, all of its many entertaining
and very rich characters and their comedy as well but I frankly never
have been too impressed with their movies. Most of them are still great
fun but they are also quite weak and clumsily ones in some ways as
well.<br /><br />The story is really far too simplistic, even for a Muppet movie. This
movie was meant to bring the Muppets back again and that&#x27;s exactly
what&#x27;s happening in the story. The Muppets are reuniting once again to
safe their beloved theater from being demolished. The story is the sort
of story anyone could had come up with during a first brainstorm
session for a new Muppet movie, that was supposed to reunite and
reintroduce all of the beloved characters. It never feels like lots of
time and effort went into it and the most important thing for the
writers was to simply bring the Muppets back again, without having a
true original story backing things up.<br /><br />And I don&#x27;t know what it is but human actors and Muppets don&#x27;t work out
too well together, most of the times. It&#x27;s as if actors have no idea
how to act when doing a scene with a Muppet, so they go for a very safe
and childish approach. It&#x27;s funny, no matter how many great starts you
bring in to a Muppet movie, it will still be the Muppets who steal the
show and upstage its human cast. And that is also definitely the case
with this movie.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t know why they keep trying but again there are human characters
who play an important role for the movie. But really, who goes to see a
Muppet movie for Jason Segel or Amy Adams? You could say that this
movie has too human characters in it, especially for its first half. I
don&#x27;t want to see humans dancing and singing. I want to see Muppets do
that! And when you have an actor like Chris Cooper playing the main
villain, you shouldn&#x27;t waste him in the way like this movie does. He
was the only human character I was interesting in seeing more of but he
plays a very generic role and is hardly in the movie at all, sadly.<br /><br />And talking about human actors; Muppet movies often had been filled by
cameos of well known actors but this movie goes a bit too far.
Seriously, some actors make a 3 seconds appearance, that is a totally
irrelevant one as well. It seems like this movie is being filled with
cameos, just for the sake of it. And I admit, I missed half of the
cameos simply because I didn&#x27;t recognize some people or had no idea who
they were in the first place.<br /><br />These are all complaints about this movie, that made me see it as a far
from perfect movie, as opposed to most other people, who simply are in
love with it. No, I don&#x27;t really get that but despite all of my
complaints I still really liked the movie.<br /><br />It was good, clean, simple, fun and it was great to see the Muppets
doing their thing again, like they never had been gone. Most of the big
name Muppets appear in this movie, though some people might of course
still complain about it that it doesn&#x27;t feature his or hers favorite
Muppet prominently enough. But that&#x27;s what happens when you have a
movie that is supposed to reintroduce ALL of the Muppets to the world
again.<br /><br />The Muppets especially get to shine in the final 30 minutes, which is a
throwback to the famous &#x22;The Muppet Show&#x22;, that aired from 1976 till
1981 and has aired for many years after that as well, in many different
countries. It was the part of the movie that I truly liked and enjoyed
watching and it made me wish the rest of the movie was more like that.
But who knows. This movie has pretty much setup the Muppet franchise
again and probably a lot more movies will spawn from it, in which the
Muppets don&#x27;t need to get reintroduced again and they can do their
thing, from the start on, without the interference of too many human
characters hopefully. Oh and with some better songs as well please.<br /><br />Most people will mostly love it for nostalgic reasons and those
unfamiliar with the Muppets will like it for its charm, comedy and just
overall entertainment value.<br /><br />7/10 <br /><br />http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/
