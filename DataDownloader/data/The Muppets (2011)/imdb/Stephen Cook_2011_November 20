The Muppets may quite possibly be one of the best movies of 2011. I
don&#x27;t just mean that as a fan. The Muppets had everything spot on &#x96; it
was clever, entertaining, adorable, heartwarming, and absolutely
hilarious. The magical thing though is that The Muppets pleases
everybody -- average moviegoers and Muppet purists alike, and that I
believe is its greatest triumph. On one side is a modern comedy, chock
full of hysterical celebrity cameos and pop culture references. And on
the other side is a nostalgic throwback to the Muppets era. Those who
remember the old series will unquestionably find delight in seeing
their favorite puppets reunite for another big show, literally.<br /><br />Funnily enough, the movie treats the Muppet characters as if they were
real life actors, with The Muppets shows and movies being their past
careers. The Muppets haven&#x27;t seen any action in years (a fact also true
in real life), and each muppet has taken his/her own path in life with
varying degrees of success. When crisis arises, the old troupe is
forced to find each other and give it another go.<br /><br />It is all weaved through a fascinating metanarrative that begs the
question, what happens to the Muppets when they aren&#x27;t The Muppets?
After all this time away, can The Muppets make a comeback through a
reunion and relive their former glory days? &#x96; a question ultimately
answered by the movie itself. <br /><br />The film opens with a common puppet named Walter, whose childhood
consists of watching The Muppets and dreaming of joining them. His
older brother Gary (Jason Segel) extends the invitation to come with
him and his girlfriend of 10 years Mary (Amy Adams) to Los Angeles so
that he can visit the Muppet studio. Much to his disappointment, the
Muppet theater is abandoned and Walter even overhears an oil tycoon&#x27;s
(Chris Cooper) plot to tear down the place. Walter and Gary quickly
seek out Kermit the Frog to reunite the Muppet crew and remedy the
situation, but all the while Mary is upset that the turn of events is
ruining her 10 year anniversary with Gary.<br /><br />As you can imagine from the premise alone, the movie is a tribute to
the Muppets in every sense. It travels respectfully through the old
Muppet history, and relives it instead of trying to replace it. In
fact, seeing how each one branched off from the group like members of
an old band and &#x22;grew up&#x22; gave, I would say, substantially more
character to each Muppet than they ever had before. I think fans will
agree that this is the best possible way the muppets could have
returned.<br /><br />Simply put, I can&#x27;t imagine anyone with a heart not enjoying this film.
There&#x27;s something in it for everybody, especially if you&#x27;re in the mood
for laughter and catchy musical numbers. The creative humor was a
breath of fresh air. There is plenty breaking of the fourth wall and oh
so much of that lovely deadpan irony and absurdist humor, reminiscent
of old comedies like Airplane! The audience in the theater was cracking
up almost every other moment, myself included. And while humor is its
strong suit, the movie is also an incredibly heartwarming tale of
friends that go their separate ways but are still connected through
their hearts. Moviegoers and Muppet fans alike, go see this movie!<br /><br />9/10
