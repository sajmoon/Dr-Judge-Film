This movie is by far the best I have seen all year. It has a lot of
humor in it ( a lot that appeals to the older viewer as the Muppet have
never been just for children). The new character both human and Muppets
(Walter is amazing) have a lot of heart to them. THis will be the first
movie in over ten years that I will happily see more than once in
theaters. It is a very emotional movie that makes us feel for these
characters made of felt. The music is very memorable too. Jason Seagal
is very clearly a Muppet fan, and you can tell by watching this film
that all involved wanted to capture and preserve the old Muppet magic
from the time of Jim Henson. This is by far my favorite Muppet movie
since the Great Muppet Caper. The Muppets are back and hopefully we
will see more in the future.
