Forrest Gump, Never Back Down, Warrior. The 3 previous films that was
entitled my favourite movie, now its The Muppets! I gave this movie a
10 out of 10 because, for me, it was the most enjoyable experience I
have had in the cinema in a long time. <br /><br />Along with all the original muppets, plus the new one (walter), The
Muppets stars Jason Segal and Amy Adams, 2 actors/actresses I couldn&#x27;t
have been more pleased with to lead in this movie. You can tell they
did not expect to win any Oscars for this movie based on their
performances but at the same time you can tell through their incredible
enthusiasm throughout the entire movie that this movie meant a massive
deal to them. Besides the U- rated depressing scenes which,
comedically, captured what is all too often used in modern cinema for
the character that is down on their luck, you see that both Jason Segal
and Amy Adams are smiling throughout this entire movie and based on the
quality of this film, you can tell why. <br /><br />Now, this film won&#x27;t be for everyone, if you find yourself to the bad
guy in this movie, the rich oil tycoon (Chris Cooper) who is looking to
get rid of the muppets for reasons I don&#x27;t want to spoil, then you
probably won&#x27;t enjoy the light hearted, pleasant, happy, enthusiastic
tone of this movie, which would make you a bit of an arsehole.<br /><br />This movie being a musical, you may be wondering about the quality of
songs? Well, lets just say they made me buy the soundtrack as soon as I
got home for full price. The fact one song won an Oscar should persuade
to expect the best from these musical muppets! Musical Sidenote: If you
watch the Big Bang Theory, you&#x27;ll be in for a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Now for the rest of the cast, there are too many cameos to name so i&#x27;ll
let you question at the end how many cameos were actually in this
movie! Trust me, these camios either make you laugh out loud or
pleasantly grin in happiness.<br /><br />Overall, The Muppets is my new favourite movie and it would be money
well spent to see in the cinema for anyone who just wants to see an
enjoyable, cheerful, charming, well-made, well-scripted, well sung
comeback film of THE MUPPETS!
