When I first heard of &#x22;The Muppets&#x22; movie reboot, I truly had no major
desire to see it. Having not been a big fan of them (because I was not
alive when they were in their &#x22;heyday&#x22;) there was no real urge for me
to go and see it. Well with some twists and turns, I winded up going to
watch the film.<br /><br />Right from the get-go I realized this movie was not just meant for
children, and it was actually, surprisingly funny. The &#x22;Muppets&#x22;
sarcastic humor and witty personalities add up to make one lovable,
great film. <br /><br />On the down side, there were times during the film that I found myself
dozing off. Maybe the cause of my fatigue was my lack of sleep, but I
truly think at some points the movie just dragged on. Since this is a G
rated film, that means there must be some &#x22;life lesson&#x22; moment during
the film, which typically occurs once. Although in this movie, it was
not a rare occasion to have the characters talk about how the lessons
they learned will help them in life. Now while I am not saying this is
a negative aspect, I just think they could have toned down those parts
of the film.<br /><br />Overall, &#x22;The Muppets&#x22; was an extremely pleasant surprise to me. Jason
Segel and Amy Adams (both who are always a delight) made the film that
much better. I think I could boldly say that any adult who was a fan of
&#x22;The Muppets&#x22; as a child, will find out that they did not disappoint in
this motion picture.
