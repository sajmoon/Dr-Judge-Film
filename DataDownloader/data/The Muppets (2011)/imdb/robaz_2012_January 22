This delightful film co-written by star Jason Segal, celebrates the
Muppets and their charming, heartfelt history. If one thing has
separated the Muppets from most family entertainment, it&#x27;s the
franchises appeal to adults as well as children. Kids love the vibrant
colors and wacky voices, adults love the sly humour and witty cultural
references. The 2011 reboot lovingly maintains that style, as the
characters leap off the screen and into your hearts.<br /><br />The film, which is as sweet and humble as Kermit the Frog, manages to
recreate the charm of Jim Henson&#x27;s 1970s creations and introduce the
timeless characters to a vastly different 21st century audience without
an ounce of cynicism. While it is as charmingly scruffy around the
edges as Fozzie Bear, the films witty script (which was cleaned up by
the folks at Pixar) and lovable characters will win new fans and please
long time devotees. Even if the film is not a monumental achievement
and some of the musical numbers feel forced, it&#x27;s hard not to be won
over by Jim Henson&#x27;s fuzzy creations. Also watch out for numerous
celebrity cameos in the tradition of the Muppet films of yesteryear.
