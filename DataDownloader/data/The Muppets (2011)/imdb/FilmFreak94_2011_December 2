The Muppets haven&#x27;t really been in the spotlight for a few years.
They&#x27;ve had some TV appearances but other then that The Muppets haven&#x27;t
had a big screen appearance for over a decade. So when I saw the
trailer for this movie I was sold immediately. And let me tell you
after just watching it, it didn&#x27;t disappoint at all.<br /><br />The basic plot is this; Walter is a huge fan of The Muppets and travels
with his brother Gary(Jason Segal) and his girlfriend Mary(Amy Adams)
to Los Angelas to see the old Muppet theater. When he finds that a a
business tycoon plans to destroy the theater to get oil underneath it,
Walter meets Kermit the Frog and they all decide to get the gang back
together to try and save the theater. Nearly all of the old gang is
here as they get Fozzie, Gonzo, Sam, Animal, Miss Piggy etc. They need
to raise 10,000,000 dollars in order to save the theater and bring the
Muppets back in the limelight.<br /><br />This was a huge nostalgia trip for me. Seeing the Muppets on the big
screen for the first time since I was a kid brought tears of joy to my
eyes. The songs are what you&#x27;d expect from The Muppets: catchy, well
written, and just a lot of fun. In typical form, a lot of celebrities
make cameo appearances in this movie(Neil Patrick Harris, Whoopi
Goldberg, Jack Black, Mickey Rooney etc.) and they&#x27;re all done very
well.<br /><br />I can go on and on about how this movie is just an all around great
family film. Even if you or your kids have never even heard of the
Muppets you can still have a great time watching the movie. There&#x27;s
something in it for everyone. The only real negative aspect I can think
of is a few Muppets weren&#x27;t really used to their potential and some
didn&#x27;t show up at all. But still, with a movie like this I&#x27;m willing to
look over that issue. Everything in this movie is just near perfect. I
can almost guarantee that you won&#x27;t regret seeing this in theaters. Jim
Henson would be proud.
