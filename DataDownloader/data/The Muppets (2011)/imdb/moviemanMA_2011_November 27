In Disney&#x27;s major release for the holiday season, they went with an old
stand by, the Muppets, in a film simply called The Muppets. It&#x27;s a
strange blend of humor, nostalgia, and satire. Here we meet Walter, who
we know just by looking at him is a little bit different. He is, well,
for lack of a better word, a Muppet. The only thing is he is a Muppet
living in the real world, and not, I stress not, a member of the Muppet
gang. At a very young age he fell under their spell, through television
and video rentals. Walter&#x27;s dream was to walk through the studio that
his beloved Muppet&#x27;s walked through. He gets his chance to meet them
when his brother Gary (Jason Segel, who also co-wrote the script) takes
his girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) to Los Angeles.<br /><br />Walter finds out that the Muppets aren&#x27;t as popular as they used to be.
He finds only remnants of the glory days in a dusty studio, but winds
up uncovering a sinister plot intending to bury the Muppet franchise
for good. With so much at stake, Walter goes to great lengths to find
his idols and bring them back together. With the help of Gary, Amy,
Kermit, Fozzie, and the rest of the gang, Walter sets in motion a
reunion scenario where if the Muppets put on one last show they can
raise enough money to stop the maniacal Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) from
ending the Muppet&#x27;s hopes of survival.<br /><br />It&#x27;s almost like The Blues Brothers, where if &#x22;the band&#x22; gets back
together all will be saved. The only difference is that for the
audience it&#x27;s like a reunion, too. We haven&#x27;t seen the Muppets together
save for a few commercials and music videos here and there. I would be
lying if I said I didn&#x27;t get goosebumps seeing Gonzo with his chickens,
or the Swedish Chef and his man-hands. Without even trying this film
grabs you right in the heart, squeezing every ounce of childhood you
have left in there.<br /><br />It is really evident that Segel took the task of acting and, more
importantly, writing, very seriously. His heart really comes through.
He didn&#x27;t want to do an injustice to the franchise that gave him so
much pleasure as a youngster. It&#x27;s as if he wrote Walter as a
Muppetization of himself (which really comes through during one
particular musical number). He follows the Muppet formula of combining
cultural references with the power of celebrity and the importance of
silliness and childlike inhibition.<br /><br />Has any of the magic left the Muppets? I don&#x27;t think so. I must admit
that some of the story points were a bit ridiculous, and sometimes a
little too on the nose (yes, I am aware that it was trying to be, but
doing it too much becomes tedious). I wasn&#x27;t entering the film
expecting completely revamped Muppet style. It was by the book, aimed
appropriately at both children and adults, without ever stepping too
far in either direction.<br /><br />The BIG question remains...now what? The whole point of the movie is to
show that the Muppet&#x27;s have basically become an afterthought. A fond
memory that quickly fades. Will this film attract a slew of Muppet
followers? Will there be another film? Television show? Who knows. The
movie ends optimistically, but how could it not? The thought of a world
without the Muppets is scary. It&#x27;s nice knowing that somewhere Kermit
and the gang are waiting for their next queue. To light the lights, put
on make up, and all that jazz.<br /><br />So go treat yourself to a little taste of your childhood. It will do
the soul good.
