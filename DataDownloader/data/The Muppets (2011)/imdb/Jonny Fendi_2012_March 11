No, it&#x27;s not Sunday morning. But &#x22;it&#x27;s time to play the music, it&#x27;s
time to light the lights&#x22;. Here they are! Kermit and the whole gang are
back! The Muppets are carrying one last show to raise money. In order
to maintain their studio before the evil oil tycoon shatters it down.
There is only one problem. Have they been forgotten? With the real
world reflects just like the story in thiz movie, since the very first
stage of movie-making process, thiz movie was way underrated. People
keep asking, did thiz movie will actually work? Anyway, look how well
the movie is doing now. The Stars sparkle all over the place. The
famous frog Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, Scooter, Animal and
other members of The Muppets, can bring the hilarious atmosphere
instantly, including the new introduced character, Walter. Jason Segel
proves out to be surprisingly talented with his energetic singing and
dancing. &#x22;Enchanted&#x22; (2007) princess Amy Adams is a brilliant choice
for her role, she is an unarguable Disney princess figure in human
form. The bad guy looks cynical and funny at the same time, played very
very well by Chris Cooper. Not to mention, it&#x27;s featuring endless
Celebrity Guests such as Jack Black, Emily Blunt, Zach Galifianakis,
Whoopi Goldberg, Selena Gomez, Ken Jeong, Sarah Silverman, Neil Patrick
Harris, John Krasinski and even Dave Grohl from &#x22;Foo Fighters&#x22;. James
Bobin made his directorial debut through thiz movie. The songs are part
of thiz musical extravaganza. The singles like &#x22;Life&#x27;s a Happy Song&#x22;,
&#x22;Me Party&#x22; or &#x22;Man or Muppet&#x22; are one of the best moments. The ending
scene is effective (Spoiler Alert!). When is told that they have
finally got the appreciation and applause from millions of people
outside the studio. It&#x27;s simply to say, we could have happy tears
along. It&#x27;s not just about the Muppets anymore. But it&#x27;s also about
every one of us who have grown up with these guys. Whether we realize
it or not, in that very moment, we had a sort of feeling, it&#x27;s like we
looked back the years we had been through and we suddenly realized how
much we had already changed. The innocent world that we once had is
exist. The Creator Jim Henson must be proud of what they have done.
Thanks, guys. Thanks for bringing us the third greatest gift of all,
which is the laughter! When they do, they&#x27;ve got the whole wide world
in the palm of their hand.<br /><br />Visit My Blog on JONNY&#x27;S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com
