It&#x27;s been quite a while since the Muppets have been in a movie. The
last was 1999&#x27;s Muppets from Space which, for some inexplicable reason
all the critics hated. That movie was just as good as any Muppet film,
but perhaps the world had grown too cynical for the felt characters.<br /><br />In this new installment, cynicism is a strong theme running throughout.
Can a group of Muppets who have never made a joke at the expense of
another make a come back in a world that spends so much time scoffing
at idealism and good-heartedness? The answer, of course, is yes. In the
hands of star and co-writer Jason Segal, The Muppets is everything that
made the characters so beloved in the first place. Frank Oz may have
said that the film doesn&#x27;t stay true to the characters, but he&#x27;s dead
wrong. The Muppet gang is as good natured as ever, and is always
optimistic in the face of despair.<br /><br />The story follows Gary (Segal) and his girlfriend going to Los Angeles
to celebrate their 10th anniversary. Gary brings along his brother,
Walter, who is not only a Muppet creature, but a huge fan of the
Muppets. When they arrive in LA, Walter discovers that an evil oil
tycoon is planning to tear down the Muppet Theater. The only way to
save it is for the gang to get back together and put on a show to raise
10 million dollars.<br /><br />Everyone is wonderful in the film. Jason Segal is funny and sweet as
the main character, and Amy Adams does a superb job at playing the
often out-of-the-loop girlfriend. But the real stars are the Muppets,
who are all wonderfully handled and, as always, have remarkable depth.
Kermit is always a leader, yet we see he has trouble showing his
emotions, which results in him and Miss Piggy having relationship
problems throughout the film. Piggy&#x27;s &#x22;I am woman&#x22; persona is a front
for her many insecurities.<br /><br />The &#x22;lets do one last show&#x22; plot allows for a lot of nostalgia to come
into the film. But not for one moment does it seem unwanted or overly
cheesy. The film is really about the Muppets finding themselves again.
In the uber-commercialism of the 21st century, the seemed to have lost
their place (Scooter has been working for Google). With the help of
long time fan Jason Segal, the Muppets have re-established themselves
as characters unmoved by modern bleakness.<br /><br />If there is anything to complain about in The Muppets, it&#x27;s that it
takes a little too long for Walter and co. to finally meet the Muppets,
and there is not nearly enough Gonzo. But hey, that&#x27;s what Muppets from
Space is for.<br /><br />This new installment in the Muppets series is as good, funny, and
heartwarming as anyone could have hoped. For older audience members it
will also be a wonderful nostalgia trip, filled with references to
classic Muppet moments. And this film adds plenty of brand new moments
that are sweet, delightful, and very funny.<br /><br />http://thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com/
