2011_December 1 
I really thought that I would love this film given all it&#x27;s critical
acclaim. I had a lot of time to think about this one over the last 2
days and how honest I wanted to be about this film. I can&#x27;t say that it
really took my breath away as much as I had hoped, but overall, I did
end up liking it more than I disliked it. I do think that over half the
songs didn&#x27;t really work and felt incredibly awkward. Some of the
cameo&#x27;s here are really what made the film for me. One fellow critic
here states &#x22;A rapping Chris Cooper takes uncomfortable awkwardness to
a whole new level&#x22; . This statement is about as true as it gets. Also,
the small part with Alan Arkin really felt quite depressing as for a
number of other scenes in the film with the Muppets themselves. It
seemed the Muppets spent most of the time being quite mopey, while it
was the new characters that brought life to the film and brought
something joyful to it. There is also a new Muppet in here which I
don&#x27;t recall from the past who is basically a trans gender version of
Miss Piggy. This I found to be a bit disturbing to say the least. Some
may find it funny, but I found it to be really out of place in this
film.<br /><br />If you&#x27;re a huge fan of the Muppets, this is a must-see, and in all
honesty, I have been quite a huge fan of the Muppets in the past, and
perhaps I need to do some re-watching of the old material to acquire
more appreciation for this one. However, after seeing this, I can&#x27;t say
that my fandom has grown at all, and honestly, I can see this going
down in history as one of the most overrated films of 2011. But thats
me.
