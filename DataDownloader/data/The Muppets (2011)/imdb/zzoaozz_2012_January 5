I think this movie was confused as to its genre.<br /><br />The Muppet Show was a comedy/variety show and I expected the movie to
be a musical comedy like the previous movies. Unfortunately the movie
is completely lacking in comedy. Not only is it not funny, it is
actually depressingly not funny. Not even Jack Black with his normal
clowning around helps. The sight gags are juvenile and unoriginal.
There is none of the slick wordplay from the TV show. The parody-like
references to the movie making process are very heavy handed and not
amusing. Sadly, Fozzie&#x27;s bad jokes were not as old and worn out as the
movie hooks. <br /><br />It was not funny enough to be a comedy, but likewise, it was not
dramatic enough to be a drama. The human characters were cartoonish
which would have been fine if the movie were comedic, but it was not.
So they come across as pathetically lame. By the end of the movie, you
have to wonder why you just wasted so much time.<br /><br />The musical numbers sprinkled liberally through the movie do not save
it either. They are very contrived and predictable and the lyrics
forgettable. Rather than relieve the dramatic tension, set up a plot
twist, or make way for something funny they just provide plenty of dead
time to go to the bathroom or get a snack.<br /><br />Rarely is a movie so bad that I cannot find anything at all to redeem
it, but this one truly is that bad.
