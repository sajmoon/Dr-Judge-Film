We all have a lot to thank Jason Segel for, and the highest thing on
that list is bringing the muppets back into everyone&#x27;s mind, if it
weren&#x27;t for him I&#x27;m sure this movie would have been a dream that never
would have come true. We all know those crazy characters called the
muppets, and they are just as charming and funny today as they were 20
years ago, and most are all present here in this fun filled family
adventure full of songs, laughs and charm.<br /><br />The story is pretty easy, two very big muppets fans and their female
companion travel to LA to visit the muppet theatre only to find it
dilapidated and crumbling to the ground, it&#x27;s then that they also
realize that an evil oil tycoon is out to destroy all things muppet, so
comes all the adventures as they round up the muppet gang in hopes of
reviving the clan everyone loves. As I said earlier most of the main
muppets are present and accounted for, Kermit, Gonzo, Miss Piggy,
Fozzie and the rest however I did notice the absence if Rizzo The Rat,
my own personal favourite, but his absence is quickly made up for by
joke after joke and laugh after laugh. This is certainly a film that
adults will enjoy just as much as kids, if not more, there are lots of
adult jokes thrown in for good measure. The only thing I would say I
was disappointed with was Amy Adams character, she was so underused,
now Amy Adams is amazing, she can sing dance and act the socks off
anyone and she was just standing there for most of the film, her
character could have been on screen a lot more I think, but the short
time she is in it she&#x27;s great, and Jason Segel is excellent as the
lead, as is Sam Cooper as the villain, a great role for him.<br /><br />It&#x27;s hard not to succumb to all the fun and mayhem that comes along
with The Muppets, you&#x27;d be a serious grump if you didn&#x27;t like it,
equally as good as The Smurfs and just as much fun. :)
