Incredibly silly humor coupled with a boring story - this, from the
perspective of a 28yo guy.<br /><br />Not worth the time.<br /><br />For a children&#x27;s movie, it did have some unnecessary violent scenes.
Displaying to children that problems could be solved through the use of
violence.<br /><br />There was also some blatant product placement in the movie, which I
found to be quite shameful considering it&#x27;s a children&#x27;s movie (Coca
Crapa, Red bullsh*t etc).<br /><br />Peace
