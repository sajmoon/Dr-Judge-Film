There are plenty of big action scenes throughout but it&#x27;s the first
half of the film that really impresses. Establishing these characters
and the entire universe is done remarkably well and in a remarkably
moving manner. This new spin on familiar &#x22;bad guys&#x22; Magneto and
Mystique does give the actions and emotions for the characters a new
level of appreciation and helps give them so much more depth and
pathos. Both sides of the fence (Xavier&#x27;s vision and Magneto&#x27;s
contempt) are advanced and the brilliance of the plot is that both
sides are understandable and relatable. The viewer can simply sit and
watch it unfold but also be emotionally invested in the journey. During
the second half, plot threads move towards resolution and action picks
up. Xavier is a shining example and his journey throughout the film
matches that of Erik.<br /><br />First Class never undermines the audience nor talks down to them and
does all that is expected of it. It delivers great action, humor,
effects and a strong connection between heroes, villains and those
developing in between. The retro design is suave and making this a
period piece gives it a cool and unique flavor. The collaboration
between Singer and Vaughn apparently was a perfect blend. Vaughn did a
brilliant job and Singer&#x27;s vision from the first two films stayed in
tact and was enhanced. I have to add that the score had a perfect
heroic theme but was also moving and very well done. The overall impact
of this film leaves you with a great sensation of a job well done. Fast
paced yet filled with depth, spellbinding visual effects and a gripping
finale. In the end, they succeeded in re-establishing these characters
in a superb and interesting manner. There is more to offer and more
depth to appreciate. I certainly can&#x27;t wait for a sequel and inclusion
of Scott and Jean from the original trilogy.
