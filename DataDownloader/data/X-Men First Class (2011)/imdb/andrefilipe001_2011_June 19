This movie is unquestionably the best so far in the year of 2011! I
went with really high expectations to watch this movie and boy could I
have been any happier to see how it turned out! This movie is so
freakin awesome that my back bones chilled a couple of times at its
majestic awesomeness. It&#x27;s just superbly made, extremely captivating
acting, above all my wildest expectations. to say that I almost cried a
few times, at the beauty of the footage is to say a lot, considering
that: a) i never cry in movies b) this is no drama I don&#x27;t wanna spoil
any bit of this masterpiece to nobody therefore I am done for today.
Just BRILLIANT 10 stars, because there aren&#x27;t any more stars to give,
otherwise I would have given it an 100 for sure.
