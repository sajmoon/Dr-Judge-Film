Xmen: First Class is simply fantastic. Strong emotion and explosive
action. The acting is top notch. Delivery from every actor is at it&#x27;s
best, more so from Mystique, Beast, Xavier and Magneto. <br /><br />The story is more character based than action, however the action
sequences are still superb. Personally i&#x27;d have liked to of seen it
being a 15 and have a more adult but it wasn&#x27;t a big issue. Also some
more background story from the bad super&#x27;s would have been good but
again this wasn&#x27;t too much of an issue and would leave some nice room
for upcoming xmen movies. <br /><br />I don&#x27;t want to say too much but to break it down... Go see this film
no matter what you are into. There is something for everyone. 9/10 easy
