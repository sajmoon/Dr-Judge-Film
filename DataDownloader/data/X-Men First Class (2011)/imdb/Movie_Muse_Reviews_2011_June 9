Superhero movies have been thriving in both Hollywood and public
consciousness for almost 10 years now, and one of the biggest reasons
has been the origin story. &#x22;Spider-Man&#x22; in 2002 revealed how the
emotional power of a superhero&#x27;s motivation can humanize even those
characters with the most extraordinary powers. &#x22;X-Men: First Class&#x22;
provides this oh so necessary background to a franchise whose last two
film entries sacrificed depth of character for mutant and superpower
pageantry. Wolverine might be the most popular character from the
&#x22;X-Men&#x22; world, but the story of how Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr
developed two different ideologies and became Professor X and Magneto
encapsulates the comics&#x27; core. &#x22;First Class&#x22; recognizes this all the
way.<br /><br />When the action-packed but unmoving &#x22;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&#x22; was
announced, it came coupled with the hiring of a writer for &#x22;X-Men
Origins: Magneto.&#x22; &#x22;First Class&#x22; essentially gives us that story. This
is a film about Erik&#x27;s decision to become Magneto and Michael
Fassbender revels in the spotlight as the powerful metal-bender who
eventually leads what becomes the Brotherhood of Mutants. Fassbender
will continue to be an acting force to reckon with in the future as he
brings incredible depth to a character already written so well.<br /><br />&#x22;X-Men: First Class&#x22; has to be the best-written superhero film since
&#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22; and maybe ever behind the first two &#x22;Spider-Man&#x22;
films. The script is loaded with thematic insights into the notion of
being an outsider &#x97; the very notion that&#x27;s made this comic so
universally loved. The fascinating complexity of Magneto and Mystique
(Jennifer Lawrence) gets abundant attention and even the minor
characters exude that feeling of learning to embrace and understand
their powers and differences for the first time.<br /><br />The film opens with a scene directly from the original &#x22;X-Men&#x22;: a young
Erik at a concentration camp gets separated from his mother and bends a
metal gate. A Nazi doctor takes note of this ability and meets with
Erik, eventually killing his mother in front of him as to provoke the
anger that triggers Erik&#x27;s powers. That villain happens to be a mutant
himself, one who in the &#x27;60s becomes known as Sebastian Shaw (Kevin
Bacon). Erik&#x27;s one goal is to avenge that death. This background alone,
that of a Holocaust survivor, makes Erik such a challenging character
for an audience. In his pursuit of Shaw, Erik meets Charles (James
McAvoy), whose own quest to find other mutants with the help of a young
CIA agent named Moira McTaggert (Rose Byrne) also has him tracking
Shaw. As it happens, Shaw&#x27;s plan is to incite the Cuban Missile Crisis
and start a nuclear war, setting the stage for mutant supremacy.<br /><br />Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart are tough shoes to fill, but
Fassbender and McAvoy make those characters their own while commanding
the screen much like those venerated talents. Despite the film leaning
heavily toward Magneto&#x27;s story, McAvoy impresses here as a rallying
leader figure. He has a youthful charisma that a bald wheelchair-bound
Professor X never gets the luxury of wielding in the original films,
but he demonstrates a maturity we&#x27;ve never gotten to see from McAvoy,
who&#x27;s always playing teenage or 20-something characters thanks to his
boyish looks. The chemistry between him and Fassbender echoes that
between McKellan and Stewart but in a much different way. With this
film now in the &#x22;X-Men&#x22; canon, I think revisiting the original trilogy
would actually make the original films&#x27; Magneto-Professor X subplots
more powerful. That&#x27;s how well the writing team captures their
relationship and story despite the many other things going on.<br /><br />Director Matthew Vaughn strikes a nice balance between the grittiness
of a &#x22;Layer Cake&#x22; and the superhero fun of &#x22;Kick-Ass.&#x22; Vaughn milks the
most he can out of a PG-13 rating as some gruesome deaths are left to
the imagination or shown simply without the blood. Graphic enough or
not, &#x22;First Class&#x22; keeps a dark tone with the exception of all the
teenage mutants learning to control and showing off their powers. Even
then, they remain firmly rooted in the script&#x27;s core ideas and
messages.<br /><br />&#x22;First Class&#x22; forces you to keep track of several mutants, but only a
couple feel hollow or ineffective. Despite being a comic book icon,
Emma Frost appears to be nothing but a fembot as played by January
Jones. A telepath like Professor X but with the ability to turn her
skin into diamonds, she serves Shaw with seemingly no regard for her
own interests, whatever they may be. Jones provides no edginess to the
character, who essentially serves the same purpose as Mystique in the
original films as the faithful but alluring evil &#x22;assistant.&#x22;<br /><br />Lawrence as Raven aka Mystique and Nicholas Hoult as Hank aka Beast
represent an effective use of subplot. Both play young mutants who
possess powers that exhibit physical characteristics. As young people,
they wrestle with questions of fitting in or embracing who they are,
which echoes the larger Erik/Charles storyline on a smaller scale.<br /><br />Regardless your thoughts on &#x22;X-Men: First Class&#x22; as a stand-alone film,
it unquestionably does great justice to the power of the &#x22;X-Men&#x22; story
as a whole and reminds us why this message has universal qualities that
all can identify with. Not only are there the questions of conformity,
but also of human nature. The climax reminds us of one of the major
differences between Charles and Erik: one has faith that humanity will
come to accept mutants and the other doesn&#x27;t. Although we&#x27;ve been
trained to agree with Charles since Bryan Singer&#x27;s first film in 2000,
&#x22;First Class&#x22; helps us come to realize the power of Magneto&#x27;s argument,
proving he&#x27;s not so much a villain, but a character with a darker and
perhaps more realistic world view.<br /><br />The talent runs very deep in this retro-fitted backstory to the &#x22;X-Men&#x22;
universe that refocuses the franchise for the better. <br /><br />~Steven C<br /><br />Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
