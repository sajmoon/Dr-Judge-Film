As if the X-Men franchise was not complicated enough, what with spin
off Wolverine and more to come, we now go back to basics with a prequel
set in the 1960&#x27;s, complete with reasonable period detail.<br /><br />The film starts, not unsurprisingly, with the cause of Magneto&#x27;s reason
to hate. Mother and young son are swept up in the persecution of Jews,
led by a scene stealing Nazi doctor, Sebastian Shaw. Kevin Bacon, an
inspired and unlikely casting choice for this particular role. Whether
such background material is suitable for a pure entertainment film, is
perhaps debatable but the opening scene is strong and very effective.<br /><br />Perhaps anything that makes a new generation hit Wikipedia to find out
more, is no bad thing.<br /><br />Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (Fassbender) has every intention of enjoying his
revenge stone cold and follows the ex-Nazi trail through South America
and ending with an early standoff with his nemesis. There follows a
very effective SFX scene with a quite spectacular use of a super yachts
anchor chain, possibly the most realistic CGI sequence in the film.<br /><br />The story switches to Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), initially using
his telepathic powers to seduce women in leafy Oxford, whilst
attempting to persuade his sister Raven/Mystique (Lawrence) that
turning blue occasionally is really not the end of the world.<br /><br />Charles and Erik come together in an uneasy friendship, following
Erik&#x27;s doomed attempt to kill Sebastian and his henchwoman Emma Frost
(January Jones), a character that struggles to keep her clothes on
throughout the film.<br /><br />The pair come to the attention of the CIA via agent MacTaggert (Rosie
Byrne), who discovers mutants led by Sebastian, are keen to push both
the USSR and USA towards World War III. A task made easier as the Cuban
missile crisis looms large with the very real possibility of nuclear
Armageddon.<br /><br />The CIA initially are somewhat reluctant to trust the mutants, but
subsequently realise their potential and place them under the very
loose control of MIB agent (Oliver Platt), who happens to have a ready
built facility for just such an eventuality.<br /><br />The team recruits more mutants and soon we have, Beast (Hoult), Havoc
(Lucas Till), Darwin (Gathegi) and Angel (Kravitz) in training for the
coming battle ahead.<br /><br />The film is a risky move, prequels or reboots are not always
successful; certainly we have a talented cast, good script and
competent director in the form of Matthew Vaughan. The studio knows
that a successful restart should spawn at least another film, if not
two.<br /><br />On the basis of this film they need not worry, this as good as it gets
for a comic book reboot. X-Men never intended to emulate the moral
complexity and darkness of the Batman franchise, the series always
represented a brighter, more colourful world and that tone generally
continues here.<br /><br />There are certainly plenty of scantily clad women to attract the target
audience but they do get some decent screen time and something to do,
notably Jones and Byrne.<br /><br />There is occasional humour to lighten the mood and Fassbender and
MacAvoy make a good job of recreating the characters we already know.
Bacon is a stand out, especially in the earlier scenes, although there
is the faintest whiff of Austin Powers as the story progresses but this
is a minor quibble.<br /><br />The film does lag slightly in the middle phase, after a very strong
start but picks up for a rousing although necessarily CGI heavy, send
off. Most loose ends are tidied up and the stage is set for X-Men the
&#x22;middle years&#x22;.<br /><br />Whether audiences need another rebooted comic book franchise, remains
to be seen but this is quality fare and certainly no quick cash in.<br /><br />Summary <br /><br />Yet another comic book blockbuster but representing solid
entertainment, with some fine character recreation, excellent effects
and an unusually strong storyline.<br /><br />Recommended <br /><br />http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/
