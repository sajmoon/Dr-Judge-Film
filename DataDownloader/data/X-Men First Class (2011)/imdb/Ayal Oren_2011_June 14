The X-Men are my favorite comic. The closest sci-fi comics ever got to
real science fiction. Un like most comics its characters are far from
cartoons, they&#x27;re 3D characters - so no wonder they didn&#x27;t need to add
the special effect. The movie was true to these aspects of the comic,
it even kept some of the original story, I wish it was even closer, but
understand the wish to tell the story differently so I&#x27;m pleased with
the fact that the concept remained the same. Using a real historic
event as the backdrop to the story is also a good addition. And above
all the actors all give their share to the final outcome. Kevin Bacon
is superb, Michael Fassbender also excels. But as I said they all do
well, and once you believe the characters and the story is good, what
else is there to ask.<br /><br />To sum it all: keeping the tradition of good X-man renditions in-fact
it&#x27;s better than the last of the original trio (didn&#x27;t see Wolverine
yet). So if you like the comic - go see it, if you like good thought
provoking sci-fi go see it too, if you&#x27;re none of the above you
probably won&#x27;t be reading this at all so that&#x27;s it.
