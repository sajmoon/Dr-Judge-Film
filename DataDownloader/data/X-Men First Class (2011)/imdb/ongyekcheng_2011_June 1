Of the original trilogy, the first X-Men movie still rates the
best.....until now.<br /><br />This prequel is an absolute stunner - from storyboard, script, mutant
characters, pace, cinematography, Foley FX, VFX....you get the picture.
In fact, the subtitle for this movie could also be X-Men: Origins. The
poignant beginnings of Magneto and Mystique are recounted, as well as
the extraordinary powers of Professor X. Yes, indeed! The good
professor had plenty of goodies (and hair) in his formative years at
Oxford University.....^^ <br /><br />I cannot wait to see X-Men prequel II and III, 3D or not.
