Director Matthew Vaughn is back for a more conventional super hero
movie after wowing audiences with last year&#x27;s &#x22;Kick Ass.&#x22; He has
redefined the &#x22;X-Men&#x22; series with a very stylish work of cinema as
attempt two at creating a prequel is successful with &#x22;X-Men: First
Class.&#x22; Like &#x22;Origins&#x22; there are a plethora of characters that the
audience has to worry about, however, with the smart use of time and
space Vaughn develops the roots of various mutants with a fluid pace.
James McAvoy (&#x22;Wanted&#x22;, &#x22;The Conspirator&#x22;) and Michael Fassbender
(&#x22;Inglourious Bastards&#x22;,&#x22;300&#x22;) set up the best on screen matchup of the
year with their respective portrayals of Charles Xavier (Professor X)
and Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto). The film commences as Erik is separated
from his mother and killed by a man named Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon,
&#x22;Frost/Nixon&#x22;). This is followed by background of a young Charles as he
befriends a very familiar character, Raven aka Mystic (Academy Award
Nominee Jennifer Lawrence, &#x22;Winter&#x27;s Bone&#x22;). After this brief
exposition, the audience is taken on a nonstop thrill ride as the
mutants influence the Cold War. Erik embarks on a path of vengeance to
kill Shaw. Since their last encounter Shaw has started his own mutant
army and has a very dangerous right-hand woman, Emma Frost (January
Jones, &#x22;Mad Men&#x22;). Meanwhile, Charles and Raven are tracked down by a
woman named Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne, &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22;) for their
mutant expertise. Everything is connected in one way or another as the
1960s setting makes the film a cool cinematic rebirth to a new &#x22;X-Men
Trilogy.&#x22;<br /><br />The Good: Director Vaughn reinvents the film series with a very well
written script and a dark old school spectacle. Combining the classic
feel of the 1960s and the Marvel comic book guise with McAvoy&#x27;s
ingenious, sexy interpretation of Professor X and Fassbender&#x27;s rugged
vindictive portrayal of Magneto makes this the best superhero film of
the year. The casting of two big name congenial actors as antagonists
(Bacon and Jones) along with giving their motive multiple purposes is
smart cinema. Cinematography finishes it all off with a mixture of &#x22;Mad
Men&#x22; flare in a comic strip.<br /><br />The character development of Angel Salvadore (Zoe Kravitz, &#x22;It&#x27;s Kind
of a Funny Story&#x22;) is very irritating, failing to produce a motive for
her later actions. This can be attributed to the fact that even though
Vaughn does a good job juggling the plethora of characters, it is
inevitable that one falls through the cracks. Also, the fast pace of
the film foreshadows a climatic ending which in actuality fails to
impress after the interminable build up.<br /><br />Vaughn is following in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s footsteps as he transforms
his second superhero comic into motion picture form. He uses more of a
comic book approach than Nolan casting to perfection and creating one
of the best prequels to ever be made.
