Now I&#x27;m sure everyone knows who the X-Men are and know about this
movie. The trailer really didn&#x27;t look impressive at all and if I wasn&#x27;t
such a huge Michael Fassbender fan, I probably would have waited to see
this movie on DVD. I saw this the day it was released but my computer
got a virus so I haven&#x27;t been able to get a review out until now.<br /><br />Keep in mind I&#x27;m a little biased since my favorite actor plays Magneto
but I absolutely loved this movie. Sure this isn&#x27;t about the original
X-Men but I feel like movies and comic books are two different entities
and if you like one and not the other then that&#x27;s fine. I used to get
upset about stuff not being faithful adaptations but now I don&#x27;t care
since all it does is help people find out about something and they
hopefully want to find out more about it and find the original
material.<br /><br />The thing that makes this movie so great is that it&#x27;s not really a
superhero movie. I mean sure there are mutants with powers but this
movie puts way more emphasis on the story and the main characters as
opposed to nonstop action or way to many mutants with powers like in
X-Men The Last Stand. This movie is basically a drama with superheroes
in it. They utilized Fassbender and McAvoy to a great extent and
Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique) and Kevin Bacon (Sebastian Shaw) did great
as well.<br /><br />I liked that they made the movie very dark (as dark as they could make
it for PG13) much like The Dark Knight but added in a fair amount of
light hearted moments. Magneto was a dark serious person while
Professor X was more of an easy going guy. I thought it was a nice
touch in seeing how he acted when he was young.<br /><br />Of course there are a couple of nit picks I have with the movie. The
kids weren&#x27;t really given enough screen time but I guess it gave you
just enough for the first movie and hopefully we get to see more of
them in sequels. Also I liked January Jones in Mad Men but she really
does not do any good as Emma Frost. Sure she&#x27;s good to look at but
she&#x27;s given most of the screen time out of Kevin Bacons henchmen which
is weird since she can&#x27;t really act well. Also I don&#x27;t think Azazel and
Riptide even talk at all during the movie.<br /><br />Overall this has been my favorite movie so far this year. I plan on
seeing Super 8 this week so we&#x27;ll see if that can top this movie. 9/10
