I believe most people understand the concept of the x-men by now. If
you have seen the previous 3 x-men, you will definitely say this blows
them away completely.<br /><br />I have got to say, I found the previous 3 x-men films really boring.
This prequel definitely has the edge and the director got it right! It
follows how the x-men started and who these two main characters are.<br /><br />The female characters are really sexy! Really sexy! I can&#x27;t believe the
cleavage in this film. Where did they find these characters.<br /><br />This is a definite watchable film.<br /><br />Anyway, without boring people - please watch it! It is on the same
wavelength of batman alike. Very nice and good film at it&#x27;s best!
