In 1944, in Poland, the boy Erik Lehnsherr unleashes his magnetic power
when his mother is sent to a concentration camp. The evil Dr. Sebastian
Shaw (Kevin Bacon) brings Erik to his office and kills his mother,
increasing his abilities through anger. In New York, the wealthy
Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) meets the mutant Raven (Jennifer
Lawrence) and invites her to live in his manor.<br /><br />In 1962, the CIA agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) discovers the
existence of mutants working with Shaw and the invites Professor Xavier
to recruit mutants to work for the USA government. Xavier teams up with
Raven, Erik and a group of young mutants. Sooner they learn that the
evil Shaw has the intention of beginning a nuclear war to destroy the
world and increase his power. <br /><br />&#x22;X-Men: First Class&#x22; is an entertaining film for fans of action films
with superheroes that discloses the beginning of the saga of the
mutants. The plot has many flaws, like for example: why Erik destroys
Dr. Shaw&#x27;s office, kills the guards but does not destroy the killer
Shaw? How Xavier and Raven become best friends after a five- minute
dialog? Why the lack of gratitude of Raven after the accident with
Xavier in the end? The power of Azazel is so exaggerated that becomes
impossible to be defeated.<br /><br />Kevin Bacon is a great villain and the insertion in the context of the
Cold War and using the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 as background is a
funny joke. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): &#x22;X-Men: Primeira Classe&#x22; (&#x22;X-Men: First Class&#x22;)
