Overall, X-Men is a great film. It features outstanding performances
(Fassbender and McAvoy are amazing), a smart script, and plenty of
action. I love the fact that when we meet Erik (Fassbender) in this
film, his life is more about revenge than anything else. Here, he&#x27;s a
lone wolf and he&#x27;s on a very specific mission and he&#x27;s Machiavellian in
his approach to whatever ends justify the means. I also loved that we
get to see why both Xavier and Erik want to be friends. You see the
moment they meet. You don&#x27;t just start the film and they&#x27;re buddies and
that&#x27;s exactly what the story requires. We also get to see something
quite tragic and deep about their relationship because it&#x27;s not a small
thing that makes it crumble. It&#x27;s only one element in their
relationship but it&#x27;s as complex as it gets. This film is just so
textured and layered and that&#x27;s refreshing in so many ways.<br /><br />They really have delivered a rarity in Hollywood &#x96; a prequel that not
only outperforms the original film, but one that gives the audience
credit. If you really want to enjoy the subtleties of First Class you
should see at least the first two X-Men first. It&#x27;s certainly not
necessary because this films stands up all on its own but it makes it
even more interesting. No time is wasted or needed explaining what they
are about to set up but it&#x27;s fascinating to see these characters
introduced and eventually grow to what they become. We&#x27;re treated to
character and story development, expanding the X-Men saga rather than
retelling it for everyone whom missed the first installment.
Personally, I&#x27;m pleasantly amazed that Fox of all studios allowed the
release of a blockbuster sequel that doesn&#x27;t cater to the lowest common
denominator. It&#x27;s refreshing to be treated as something other than a
drooling movie-going moron. X-Men First Class works on so many levels
and I absolutely love it! <br /><br />If you are concerned that this film may not live up to the hype, don&#x27;t
be. If this instant classic isn&#x27;t the best movie of 2011, then this
will truly be the best year in cinematic history. First Class is just
flat out awesome.
