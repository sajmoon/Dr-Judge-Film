X-Men: First Class is a good summer blockbuster. Director Matthew
Vaughn (Kick-Ass) crafted an engaging and entertaining film that, in
the X-Men film series, is bettered only by X2 (2003). It acts as a
prequel/reboot covering the origins of the X-Men in an alternate
history where the powerful mutant Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) attempts
to ignite a nuclear war between the USA and the USSR. Charles Xavier
(James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) are signed up by US
intelligence to foil Shaw&#x27;s plans, and in the process they become good
friends. The CGI is not perfect, but it&#x27;s put to very good use. The
story is solid (helped by the good script) with doses of effective
humor throughout. Strongest in the film is the characterization. There
are several notable performances. Bacon, McAvoy and especially
Fassbender are in excellent form. The supporting cast is fine too
(Nicholas Hoult, Zoe Kravitz, Jennifer Lawrence being the standouts).
Better superhero films have been made, but First Class is definitely a
WOW movie. It&#x27;s a good example of what summer movies should be like. I
recommend seeing it.
