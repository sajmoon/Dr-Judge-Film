The biggest problem of these prequels is it&#x27;s kind of messy to the
original X-Men movies. Well, the filmmakers said this is a reboot but
there are some references to the original X-Men series. Anyways,
&#x22;X-Men: First Class&#x22; is fun and had a lot of great action. It&#x27;s the
biggest X-Men movie ever made and it&#x27;s better than the last two X-Men
movies.<br /><br />The filmmakers stated that this movie is a reboot but things from the
old X-Men movies had an appearance to this movie. The problem of giving
reference from the old X-Men movies to this reboot is it doesn&#x27;t make
this movie stand alone. Maybe the references only made for the laughs
but if this is a prequel then it&#x27;ll be a total mess.<br /><br />The best parts goes to the action(obviously). Matthew Vaughn knows how
to make big and awesome action scenes. The best parts also goes to the
scenes of Michael Fassbender. He really steals the show. He made
Erik/Magneto more dangerous than ever. It&#x27;s fun and intense to see him
do something menacing. The rest of the cast is also pretty good. James
McAvoy gave a lot of heart to his role. Him and Fassbender had good
chemistry.<br /><br />Overall, &#x22;X-Men First Class&#x22; is good especially if you are looking for
large scale action. I guess large scale is one thing that&#x27;s missing to
the first four X-Men films. X3 had a large scale action that left us
hanging in the end. This one has the action finale that is intense and
really big. Maybe the reference of the old X-Men movies is only made
for the laughs. By the way this is Matthew Vaughn&#x27;s thing. There&#x27;s
action plus comedy.
