After already creating four X-Men movies making a fifth one may be
considered pushing it but instead X-Men: First Class came as a fresh
surprise with a new perspective. For all not new to the X-Men this
movie is a nice surprise as the plot look away from the classic &#x27;human
hatred towards mutants&#x27; story to a more mature and balanced story.
rather than build up from the fame of the previous X-Men it starts
fresh and allows the laymen audience to better understand the X-Men
world and the characters.<br /><br />The best thing about X-Men: First Class is the fabulous manner in which
the characters are introduced and developed. the audience may feel a
bit lost in the beginning but the film quickly unravels. James McAvoy
does a fantastic job of portraying Charles Xaviar with his casual charm
and trusting voice. Michael Fassbender also provide the perfect
contrast portraying Magneto as the mysterious character he is. that
combined with a great cast make this movie an enjoyable and
entertaining experience.
