Beginning with a crime-thriller and a fantasy film on his directorial
r&#xE9;sum&#xE9;, it is safe to say that Matthew Vaughn may have already found
his niche genre in the super-hero field despite only directing four
films in seven years. His first super-hero project, &#x27;Kick Ass,&#x27; opened
in 2010 to solid critical acclaim and a finalized gross of three times
the film&#x27;s ordinary $30 million dollar budget. And after only two
years, Vaughn returns with &#x27;X-Men: First Class,&#x27; an origins story to
accompany the Bryan Singer/Brett Ratner X-Men trilogy released between
2000 and 2006. It&#x27;s intelligent, enthralling, well-acted, stylishly
directed, and most importantly by focusing heavily upon the
relationship between the two central protagonists, it does not feel
like a conventional super-hero film.<br /><br />Set within the political context of the Cuban Missile Crisis in the
early 1960&#x27;s, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) is an up-and-coming
Professor whose life is drastically altered when he is introduced to
the other members of society who also share the same mutant gene as
himself that supplies them with super-human abilities and traits. After
stumbling upon the shape-shifting Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) within his
mansion, the telepathic Xavier then encounters Erik Lehnsherr (Michael
Fassbender), the son of Jewish parents who were murdered during the
holocaust by the narcissistic former Nazi scientist, Sebastian Shaw
(Kevin Bacon). Erik, who can manipulate all metal objects around
himself, wants retribution and nothing more from Sebastian who is now a
successful and evil underground figurehead who commands a team of
mutants (Azazel, Emma Frost and Riptide) to do his bidding for him.
But, once his plan for world domination is revealed, they find that it
far exceeds the constraints of humanity, and Xavier, Erik and a rag-tag
band of young, hide-away mutants (Havok, Beast, Darwin, Angel and
Banshee) who were discovered by Charles, must combine their powers in
one last attempt to stop Shaw from destroying the planet and humanity
as a whole.<br /><br />Instantly where &#x27;X-Men: First Class&#x27; works is in regards to its two
central characters; Charles Xavier played by an incredibly affluently
sounding James McAvoy and a rage-fuelled Erik Lehnsherr played by a
stern-faced Michael Fassbender. Their instant on-screen chemistry
provides the drive and ammunition for the plot to carry itself forward.
Both characters have differing ideologies and their constant clashes
due to this aspect allow the script to be brought to life. Instead of
simply infusing their relationship with formulaic violent clashes,
Vaughn has instead opted for more articulated verbal battles between
the two characters regarding their stance within the society they are
now becoming a part of. Xavier is an intellectual being who believes
that humans will eventually be accepted within society as equals
alongside humans, while Lenhsherr believes that mutants will always be
hunted and unable to live peacefully side-by-side with the human race,
his evidence for this resides in the anti-Semitism and hatred he
received at the hands of the Nazi party during the holocaust. This
heavy-set contradiction in ideologies allows their relationship to be
imbued with pessimism, while they may be shown as friends and fighting
together initially, fans of the comic books and films in general know
this does eventually turn into a bitter rivalry and it&#x27;s this
development which drives the plot forward.<br /><br />Aside from the script, it would also be rude to not praise the
action-sequences which take place within the confines of the 1960&#x27;s
X-Men universe. With a modest running time at two hours and ten
minutes, there are more than a few well-choreographed action sequences
that would adequately satisfy any of comic-book-to-film aficionado&#x27;s
wishing to see this film. Each character&#x27;s power or ability is at some
point represented in a destructive or defensive capacity, taking full
advantage of the fact that while many super-hero movies tend to
concentrate on the aesthetic nature of the artillery characters can be
seen to withstand from governmental agencies or blindsided human
opponents, here it is shown and constantly emphasized that human
reaction would be futile due to the overwhelming power the mutants
possess. These scenes also allow the less important characters to show
their physical presence on-screen. For example, during the climactic
fight sequence at the conclusion of the film, every mutant character
that is identified to the audience is finally shown using their
abilities to full capacity, most notably the henchmen of Shaw and the
rag-tag team of Xavier and Lehnsherr. This therefore accounts slightly
for the lack of depth that has been attempted in these secondary
characters due to the time and story constraints.<br /><br />While it is a very good and accessible comic-book/super-hero movie,
&#x27;X-Men&#x27; does also contain two central flaws. The first is superseded in
a way by the strength of both McAvoy and Fassbenders performances, as
Kevin Bacon is constantly overshadowed as the one-dimensional
antagonist of the piece. His plot to ultimately destroy humanity
becomes second fiddle to the ever intricate complex relationship
between Xavier and Lehnsherr, and his appearance seems too modelled
upon that of a James Bond villain. He has the slick hair, the beautiful
women and the villainous underground Club to boot, but Bacon
unfortunately doesn&#x27;t have the charisma to be accepted as a worthy
opponent to the protagonists. The other flaw has to do with a minor
aspect of the production itself, as the non-diegetic music, most
notably during the action sequences, begins to diminish in its impact
as the film carries on, leading to it eventually becoming the generic,
genre-related fanfare associated with the conventional comic-book
films.<br /><br />&#x27;X-Men: First Class,&#x27; is not your typical comic-book movie, it may
contain certain elements associated with the comic-book genre, but by
placing a heavy emphasis upon the strength of the plot and the script
at the film&#x27;s core instead of the action-set-pieces taking place,
Vaughn has intended, and succeeded, in transcending the stereotypical
conventions of the genre and has created a film which will appeal to a
wide range of audience members.
