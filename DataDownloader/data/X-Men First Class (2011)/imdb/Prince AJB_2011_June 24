&#x22;X-Men: First Class&#x22; is an excellent prequel to the original &#x22;X-Men&#x22;
trilogy. It has a compelling storyline chronicling the adventures of
Professor X and Magneto, or should I say, Charles Xavier and Erik
Lensherr before they became enemies, as depicted in the three movies
that form the original &#x22;X-Men&#x22; trilogy. Not only a compelling
storyline, but &#x22;First Class&#x22; also promises amazing sequences of intense
action. <br /><br />&#x22;First Class&#x22; chronicles the adventures of Charles Xavier and Erik
Lensherr before they became enemies. Set in 1962 during the Cuban
Missile Crisis, the two met during a mission in which Xavier and the
CIAs are trying to track down a guy named Sebastian Shaw, who
apparently is a mutant and acts as a threat to the world. In that time,
Xavier found Lensherr trying to stop Shaw from getting away using his
mutant powers and told him to let it go as continuing to do so will
result in the drowning of Lensherr and Xavier. Later, Lensherr and
Xavier become allies and learn of Shaw&#x27;s intentions of starting World
War 3 that would bring mutants into rulers of the world with most of
the world in turmoil. Xavier and Lensherr then decide to recruit other
mutants and create a mini mutant army to stop Shaw from igniting the
start of World War 3. Apart from stopping Shaw, &#x22;First Class&#x22; also
tells the story of how Xavier and Lensherr became enemies and split the
first generation of X-Men. <br /><br />&#x22;First Class&#x22; is truly a fantastic prequel to the popular &#x22;X-Men&#x22;
series. With a compelling storyline, it has action-packed sequences
that would keep audiences hooked until the end. The action sequences
are much more exciting than that of &#x22;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&#x22;. The
fighting scenes were very entertaining and should be enjoyed by
audiences. <br /><br />Besides the action sequences, the script, and the special effects of
the film were excellent. The script had no awkward lines and the
special effects of the film were real and life-like. The acting was
also great and there was no problem with it. Well done!<br /><br />Humor also plays a role in this film. In serious moments, sometimes to
cheer the audiences up, humor is added. The jokes and humor in the
movie was pretty funny. <br /><br />Overall, &#x22;First Class&#x22; is a mesmerizing mixture of a compelling
storyline, action-packed sequences, amazing special effects, and funny
jokes. Matthew Vaughn has crafted a fantastic prequel that serves as a
pleasant addition to the &#x22;X-Men&#x22; series (although &#x22;Wolverine&#x22; was
disappointing). This movie has great storytelling and awesome sequences
of intense action. <br /><br />In terms of recommendation, &#x22;First Class&#x22; is a must-watch summer movie
that should be on your list of must-see summer blockbusters of 2011.
The compelling storyline will keep audiences interested, the fighting
scenes should keep audiences excited, and the special effects should
make audiences satisfied with the film. Anyone disappointed with the
last &#x22;X- Men&#x22; movie, &#x22;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&#x22;, should be relieved
after watching the new, fresh, and amazing &#x22;X-Men: First Class&#x22;. <br /><br />&#x22;X-Men: First Class&#x22; is truly first-class entertainment. <br /><br />Prince AJB&#x27;s Rating: 10/10 (Excellent)<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review on &#x22;X-Men: First Class&#x22;. I do hope that
this is a useful review for you to read.
