usually I am not a fan of marvel comics, but i made an exception for
this one :) If you followed the comic book series, it uses similarities
from the comics to the movie. And we also get a cameo appearance from
Hugh Jackman(Wolverine). I may have not noticed the infamous stan lee
appearance that he always makes in the movies that deal with his
comics. But I am sure it was there. I think its a great movie for ages
5 to adult. It has history, very mild violence, some comedy, drama, and
romance. All the elements to live up to the X-Men franchise. It is not
at all disappointing if you have knowledge of the other movies or the
comic book series. That is the only flaw I see. It is definitely a
tribute to the fans of X-Men. Personally I am a DC comic books fan, but
if you are a comic fan or just a fan of the movie series your in for a
treat :) but if you have no knowledge of either of those things you
will be disappointed.
