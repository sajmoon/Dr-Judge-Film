Commenting is not something that I usually do but I am soooooooooooo
incredibly amazed and offended that somebody had the blaring audacity to
say
that this film was pathetic!  There is absolutely nothing pathetic about
this film, in fact as huge fan of both Spike Lee and Denzel Washington,
this
was my favorite film with the two of them working together.  The
cinematography is just beautiful - I remember sitting in the theater and
saying &quot;who the hell shot this?&quot; and as far as Denzel not being totally on
point, that's a crock of sh*t.  He is so in the right as is Rosario
Dawson,
who's obviously just a born natural.  If there was any stiffness in the
film, it was in the acting skills of Denzel's son, but what do you want
from
someone that's really a basketball player and not a trained actor?  As for
the scenes between Milla and Denzel, yeah, that sub plot doesn't totally
work, but it certainly doesn't hurt the film.  If anything, I think Spike
Lee grew up a lot with this movie.  I think it's a beautiful, gourgeous,
grungy, real film and I think it rocks.
