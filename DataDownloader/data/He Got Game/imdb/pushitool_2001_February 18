I didn't know anything about this film when I saw it, other than the fact
that NBA star Ray Allen was in it, and that Public Enemy did the titled
song. I figured it might be just a shallow sort of a film, not trying to be
much more, just bringing some basketball action to the big
screen.<br /><br />Man, was I wrong! I think I had a tear in my eye the whole time. Unlike
many
US films, it had no corny moments at all, and the ending was complex and
subtly brilliant. Spike Lee should be commended.<br /><br />For the many people who didn't like the ending, well, let me say, work it
out! No wonder why so many mainstream films leave nothing to the
imagination
and include endings that are simple and one-dimensional.<br /><br />Another complaint seems to be the sex scenes in the film. I thought they
were realistic. Refreshing also to see US sex scenes that aren't wimpy, for
those of us mature enough not to be offended by that sort of
thing.<br /><br />Matty Leonard.
