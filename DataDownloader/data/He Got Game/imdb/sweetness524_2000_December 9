Spike Lee is a genius filmmaker, and this movie would have been Absolutely
wonderful if it wasn't for those very unnecessary &quot;porno&quot; segments.  Once
again, Lee forgets that women do represent more than half the world and
that
they also have a point of view. Everything from story to acting (who
doesn't
love Denzel?) are wonderful, but all those porno scenes take away from the
real message of the movie (which is a great message).  It's one thing to
convey that he was pressured by many things, but it is something
completely
different to give an unrealistic view about college and women.  Other than
those few scenes of complete filth, the film was just another Spike Lee
classic.
