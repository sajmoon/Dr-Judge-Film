2000_April 10 

Denzel Washington gave an outstanding and often overlooked performance in
this film.  Ray Allen also didn't do a half bad job in his first film.  I
thought this was an excellent film about a young man trying to cope with
decisions and people's selfish ways to use him for his basketball ability.
