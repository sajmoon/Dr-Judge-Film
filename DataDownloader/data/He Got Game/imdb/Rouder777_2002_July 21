I saw He got game about a year ago. Already being a Denzel Washington fan
the movie was even more enjoyable. I loved how the movie was shot, Spike
Lee
def. has an edgy style to him. One sequence stuck out in my mind as very
powerful. The flashback scene of Jake(denzel) teaching his son how to play
basketball the hard way. I read on one user comment that they did not like
how spike chose classical music with the new york setting. I personally
thought it was brilliant. It gave some scenes a more dramatic feel. Ray
allen's acting was a tad shaky but besides that it was an exceptional
movie.
