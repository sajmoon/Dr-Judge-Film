Now an established superstar thanks to Spike Lee's direction of 'Malcolm X',
Denzel Washington pays tribute to Spike by appearing in this film which
probably represents a new phase in Spike Lee's filmmaking where he doesn't
appear in his own films. Denzel is truly the star in this film without the
pressure of having to prove himself or needing a vehicle to push his career
one step further.
An interesting film to watch as Denzel pays homage to the director that made
him a star.
