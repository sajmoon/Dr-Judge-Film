&quot;He Got Game&quot; is so badly written, so poorly acted, that Spike Lee&#39;s
admittedly great cinematic touches seem like a terrible waste of energy
and talent. One of the main problems with the film is that Lee is too
much in love with the sport of basketball to realize that the narrative
is infested with cardboard characters and ridiculous situations. Some
important sequences are downright embarrassing. The amateurish acting
is laughable too. Ray Allen simply cannot act. Poor Denzel Washington.
He is clearly above the material. He is the only real person in the
entire film. In fact, Washington is so good that he throws the film off
balance. He raises the bar so high that amateur Allen looks silly
trying to meet the challenge. And Lee doesn&#39;t even have the guts to
make the character of the father guilty of the crime he was convicted
for. The demoralizing, and nearly racist view of black women is
baffling - nothing new under Lee&#39;s sun (Imus, you are not alone!). The
music score is good but it doesn&#39;t belong here. It&#39;s a terrible movie.
