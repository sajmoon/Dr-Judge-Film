<br /><br />Another Spike Lee Classic - Another fantastic performance by Denzel
Washington. Milla Jovovich put in a decent performance but was a little
short on screen time which is understandable since this was Denzel's film
all the way. Public Enemy's music was terrific - especially the title song
'He got Game'. I think
this movie did a lot for Denzel - it enabled him to make the jump from a
terrific actor to a real star. Overall - 7/10, but it's worth watching
just
to see Denzel's performance. Great stuff.
