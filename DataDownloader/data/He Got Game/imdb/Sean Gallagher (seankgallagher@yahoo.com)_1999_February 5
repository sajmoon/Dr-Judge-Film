1999_February 5 

Lee continues to show why he's one of the best filmmakers of the 90's with
this film.  It's also one of the best basketball films ever made, along with
HOOP DREAMS and WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP.  While Lee's passion for the game is
evident, he also shows the pressures put on athletes from all sides; school,
family, people who want to live through the athletes, people who think being
an athlete automatically requires you to be a role model, groupies and other
temptations, and, of course, money.  Along with the basketball story, Lee
also adds a nicely drawn and realistic father-son relationship.  Washington
is of course in excellent form, but the surprise here is NBA player (for
Milwaukee?) Ray Allen, who not only handles the basketball scenes well, but
is a convincing actor.  The soundtrack was really good as
well.
