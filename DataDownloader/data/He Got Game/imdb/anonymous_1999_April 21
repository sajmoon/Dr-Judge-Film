1999_April 21 

For a filmmaker that shows so much promise at times, Spike Lee has thrown
up
a real stinker with &quot;He Got Game.&quot;  I will, however, begin by saying that
the idea for the film and one of the performances given (Denzel
Washington)
are not bad at all.  Also, some of Lee's shot decisions and use of
different
filming techniques are adventurous and laudable.
BUT... I am shocked to see so many good reviews of this movie, and for
several reasons
A., the dialogue and script, in general, are trite and poorly written.
Perhaps Spike would be better off getting someone else to write his
movies.
Truly poor.
B., the premise, notably the &quot;deal&quot; given to Washington by the governor,
is
absolutely far-fetched and ill-conceived.  This is a premise that could
only
be accepted if it were from an established director (which Lee
is).
C., as mentioned many times by other reviewers, Lee's use of sex and
portrayal of women seems misogynistic and baseless.  Should the sexual
temptations of a man in Jesus' position be addressed in this film?  Yes.
But in this way?  Give me a break.  I think Lee is still smarting from
getting turned down for the prom too many times.
Quite frankly, this movie is poorly conceived and disjointed.  So much so
that the ending, which could be inventive, leaves us scratching our heads.
It's time for Spike to start living up to his potential instead of
coasting
off the merits of his first film attempts.
