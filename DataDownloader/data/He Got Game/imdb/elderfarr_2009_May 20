This movie is stupid. It is long and drawn out. Ray Allen should be
ashamed of himself for the scenes he was in. Millions of kids look up
to him and he is in a scene like that. I wonder what his daughter will
think when she gets older and sees that scene. Unbelievable! The plot
was just another stupid sports movies. The only good sports movies are
true stories. That way it is not the typical same old repeated stuff
that seem to surface in every basketball movie. Spike Lee is a joke and
so is this movie. I was really excited to see this movie but if I
wanted a porno I would have walked down to Blockbuster and got one. I
lost every bit of respect for Ray Allen that I had.
