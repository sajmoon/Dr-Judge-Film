This is one of Spike Lee&#39;s best films. And the use of Copland&#39;s music
only punctuated what absolute tenderness was already there. One of the
last scenes when Washington&#39;s character throws the basketball over the
prison wall and impossibly into Jesus&#39;s court while playing (one of the
obvious interpretations of this scene being &quot;the ball is now in his
court&quot;) is one of the most beautiful scenes I&#39;ve ever seen--pure magic.
That last scene is so full of meaning and symbolism that it overpowers
the mind with all the instinctual emotions that goes with that scene:
namely the often difficult and mythic relationship between fathers and
sons, forgiveness, acceptance, and of course transcendence.
