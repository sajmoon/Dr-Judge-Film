Spike Lee's love letter to the game of basketball goes above and beyond the
modest expectations one might have about a film with a popular sport at its
core.  An exegesis on a painful, nearly unbearable father/son relationship,
He Got Game is one of Lee's best features since his masterful Do the Right
Thing.  Critics seemed to endlessly harp on the ham-handed, borderline
obnoxious religious symbolism, but I admire and love Spike Lee for daring to
attempt something so risky and bold.  The juxtaposition of Aaron Copland and
Public Enemy played brilliantly as sweeping accompaniment to the thrilling,
skillful interplay on the court and as commentary on America itself.  Denzel
Washington provides another incredible performance, and newcomer (and
real-life NBA player) Ray Allen holds his own.
