No-holds-barred story-telling directed by Spike Lee vividly shows us the
actual pressures felt by a young, future professional basketball star -
probably the most accurate account so far on film.  Jesus Shuttlesworth is
faced with many temptations along the way, but in the end he pushes all
the
leeches aside and does what's in the best interest for his family as a
whole.
