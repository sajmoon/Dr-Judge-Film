One of the other reviewers commented that the film was uneven. That couldn't
be more UNTRUE: (1) the strong sexual content WAS necessary, since it showed
all of the things our main character had to go through just because he was
good at the game of basketball, and it also fleshed out the father character
better, giving us that wonderful subplot with the hooker. (2)Jesus' name WAS
explained, but not in full entirety, because it's one of those things that
should be more left in mystery. The parents obviously named him after Jesus
Christ because of strong religous feelings. (3) Now, we come to the ending.
The ending's not really supposed to make sense. You can try to rationalize
it, but I think it's better left alone. Besides, it could have been a dream,
anyway. The film was great, one of Lee's best.
