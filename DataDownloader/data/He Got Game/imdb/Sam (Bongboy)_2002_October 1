I think this is one of my favourite films. The acting is superb, Denzel
Washington shines in his role as Jake Shuttlesworth, and Ray Allen is
also
pretty good as Jesus. As well as the smart acting there is a powerful
script
and storyline, i wont say the story because its probably already been
said
in other reviews, but the characters are believable and
original.<br /><br />The music is another good point for this film, the songs done by public
enemy really add to the feel of the film and the title song &quot;he got game&quot;
is
a brilliant track.<br /><br />My favourite aspect of this film is Spike Lee's use of the camera, his
slow
pans around and smooth camera movements with no cuts are really good,
this
film contains some of the best shots i've seen and are really
inspiring.Especially the scene when Jake is in the park hugging his
wife's
grave.<br /><br />My main criticism of this film is the ending, the film was believable and
real all the way through but the ending was a big letdown, my other
criticism is that it is a bit too long and can lose the audiences
attention
by being a bit boring.<br /><br />But overall this is a great film by one of Hollywood's best directors,
and
this film should have got more praise than it got, especially Denzel's
performance.
