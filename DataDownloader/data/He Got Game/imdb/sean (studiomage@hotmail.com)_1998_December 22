1998_December 22 

Remember the scene where Jake Shuttlesworth just came out of jail and
visits his wife's grave?  That part was the most memorable scene in the
movie, and almost made me jerk a few tears out of my eyes.  The scene was
beautifully pictured, and the sound track of Aaron Copland completely
captured that scene.  I was mesmerized by so many scenes in this movie, i
had no choice but to put it in my top 20 list.  Spike Lee worked with a
great cinematographer to put this movie together.  Although some scenes were
awkward and unnecessary..and off-track, this movie is precious and should be
valued as one of the best because it shows a classic display of film making,
in a documentary sort of way, and captured the heart of many as Jake tries
to form a bond with his son.  The ending was spectacular, even though it was
surreal, and to this day, I would recommend this movie to all that is over
18 or mature enough to view some of the scenes. This movie is REAL. This
movie is ART.  And this movie is pure, SPIKE LEE.
