1999_May 20 

A great performance by Denzel Washington, 
a so-so story line but wonderful basketball 
vignettes and weirdly appropriate music by 
Aaron Copland: Appalachian Spring, Billy the 
Kid, music from the movies Our Town, The 
Red Pony, The Heiress, etc., and a chilling 
couple of scenes using Copland's Orchestral 
Variations, which is his orchestration of his 
famous Piano Variations).  A good solid 
performance by Jim Brown, of all people.
Highly recommended.
