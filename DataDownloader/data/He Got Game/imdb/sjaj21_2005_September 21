This is one of the greatest films ever made. Denzel finally has a
different hairstyle and gives a stellar performance. He's also reveals
some impressive hoop skills! Toby you will be ROCKED by this movie, and
you can forget Training Day or The Hurricane! Spike Lee OWNS the game
on camera, or he did as soon as this movie got released! Ray Allen
gives a surprisingly good performance as High School Basketball star
Jesus Shuttlesworth, and Lee gets the support from a myriad of NBA
players including Travis Best, Rick Fox, Shaquille O Neal, Scottie
Pippen, Reggie Miller, his airness Michael Jordan and a variety of
leading basketball coaches from around the Nation. Also, whoever said
basketball and hip hop were the perfect marriage!? Try the dulcet
sounds of Aaron Copland and his orchestra and the game we all love.
Spike Lee shows us that basketball is poetic and beautiful with his
original Copland soundtrack, while Public Enemy provide the rest. 9 out
of 10!!
