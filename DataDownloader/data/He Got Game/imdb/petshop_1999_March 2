1999_March 2 

Lee's story of soon-to-be basket ball superstar, Jesus Shuttlesworth, as he
is wooed by colleges, a conniving girlfriend, and his imprisoned father, is
solid, funny, and entertaining. While his directing choices do not always
work, Lee's script is amazing. The cast is excellent. Milla Jovovich gives a
great performance in an utterly superfluous role which could have (and often
does) popped up in any movie. Aaron Copland's self-conscious score jars
against Lee's self-conscious directing. Public Enemy's excellent song would
be more effective if it was limited to being played, say, less than ten
times during the film.
