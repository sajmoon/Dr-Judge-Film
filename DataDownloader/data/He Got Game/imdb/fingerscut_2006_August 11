It&#39;s hard to write a review for a sports movie, there&#39;s just a
different standard for them. Their plots are usually contrived to a
level of laser precision. They seem almost designed to make you feel
good, which while admirable in the scheme of life, just isn&#39;t good film
making.<br /><br />For us sports fans, a sports film that comes across as &#39;above average&#39;
instantly becomes classic. This hardly seems fair, just because the
film had some scenes of athletic competion doesn&#39;t mean it shouldn&#39;t
have to face the same standards as the rest of the silver screen.<br /><br />But this is a movie that goes against that grain. It&#39;s sincerely good
by anyone&#39;s standards. The acting, even that of NBA Star Ray Allen&#39;s,
is on-par with anything else out there. Bonus points for any film where
Denzel Washington isn&#39;t playing Denzel Washington(even though I enjoy
many of those films).<br /><br />Beautifully shot, the cinematography throws a pinpoint assist to the
script and makes normally great scenes memorable and occasionally
transcendent. The film hits with such power that it really exposes
other sports movies for the fluff that they really are. Spike Lee
manages to create a film that, while deep in the world of basketball,
still can appeal to a non-sports fan. Unlike the 2006 USA Team, this
movie is destined for gold! And, my apologies for the &quot;Assist&quot; thing,
there&#39;s really no excuse. Same the the &quot;Gold&quot; thing. Still, watch the
movie. 8 of 10.
