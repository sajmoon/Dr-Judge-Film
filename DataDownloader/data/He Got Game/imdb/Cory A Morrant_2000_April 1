2000_April 1 

Overall this movie pretty much sucked, its kind of boring and contrary to
what some people say, All-Star Ray Allen is a terrible actor and detracted a
lot from the power of the movie, especially when he is paired with the
awesome force of Denzel Washington.  On the plus side the boy who played
young Jesus Shuttlesworth was very similar to Allen... also a terrible
actor.  Denzel Washington is once again amazingly convincing in his role,
this time as a mostly ignorant father with some intriguing wisdom who was
sent to prison for accidentally killing his own wife (that scene is
ridiculous, unless his wife had a completely separate unnoticed brain tumor
that coincidentally hemorrhaged just as Denzel pushed her a whole two feet
into the stove.)  Other pluses in the movie are an amazing scene involving
an agent who talks a great game and Laker Rick Fox, a much more natural
actor than Allen, who makes a cameo in an amusing scene as a black college
baller who likes his chocolate white.  The scenes between Denzel Washington
and Milla Jovovich are very nicely done (especially the work by Denzel)
although it seems odd that a bum who killed his wife and a cheap tramp
shacked up in a sleazy hotel would be two of the most attractive people on
the planet.  Unfortunately the movie's handful of great scenes are buried by
areas of ill-conceived situations and dialogue, blaring music that is poorly
chosen and a vintage Spike-Lee-totally-wacked ending.
