He Got Game is my least favorite Lee joint. It reminded me why I hate pro
sports &quot;celebrities&quot;. And I'm a little tired of the father/son films where
the dad is pleading &quot;don't do what I done wit my laff- youse can be
sumbuddy!&quot;. Denzel is convincing, but there's no support around him. (unless
you count the agent who says &quot;a Rolex is like having a corvette on your
wrist&quot;.)<br /><br />In all fairness, the film is well crafted from an aesthetic pov, but great
cinematography/lighting alone cannot carry the picture. I suppose if you
love basketball this film is a must see/buy, but I think HOOP DREAMS is far
far FAR superior. SPIKE! If you saw Hoop Dreams, then why make
this?
