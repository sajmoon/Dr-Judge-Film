1999_March 30 

I'd first like to start out by saying that I am not a big Spike Lee fan,
but
HE GOT GAME is by far Spike Lee's best film to date. Words cannot express
the visual brilliance that the film possessed. It was like watching an
urban
street drama done by Stanley Kubrick, it was excellent! The acting was
also
great, with real &amp; heartfelt performances by Denzel Washington and the
rest
of the cast as well. The story is at times decisive &amp; intense but then
switches to philisophical &amp; ponderous. Also unlike his previous films:
MALCOM X, CLOCKERS, etc., there is no racial or political agenda being
force-fed on the viewer. Rather it gives a gritty, emotional story about a
father &amp; son in the backdrop of college basketball recruiting. Its a must
see in my opinion!
