Ray Allen surprised me of his skills as an actor and he was able to
portray
the role of jesus shuttlesworth very well, however he was obviously
outshined by Denzel Washington.  Denzel in definately one of his strongest
role performances ever. The movie was a little bit better than I expected.
I enjoy movies about poverty, and how people try to pull down a rising
star
and when someone shows maturity and forgiveness when he is faced with a
difficult situation, which is to me what this movie is about.  It is a
very
realistic situation and the people react in a very human way which I
really
like because you seldom see this in movies.<br /><br />I don't know what negative things there are to say about this movie, I
enjoyed it all the way through and every time I see I feel really
motivated
to go out and play basketball.
