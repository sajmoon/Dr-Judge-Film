Jesus Shuttlesworth is the number one hope for college basketball and has
offers from colleges and sports agents ringing non-stop.  His father is in
jail for the manslaughter of his wife but is allowed out by the Governor for
4 days with a promise of further leniency if he can convince his son to go
to Big State University.  However Jesus has never forgiven him and this
pressure, on top of everything else, is the last thing he
needs.<br /><br />I'm never too sure what I'm going to take away from this film each time I
watch it, as it does tend to try and cover a lot of ground.  Is the film
about father/son relationship?  Is it about the commercialisation of school
sports?  Or pressure on young athletes?  It's hard to be sure and I'm not
sure that Lee is totally sure either.  As such it often leaves me searching
for an adequate way to summarise what I just watched.  Regardless I do feel
that the film manages to cover a lot of bases well.  The stuff about the
sports system is well worked without ramming down your throat &#150; the
exaggeration (or is it?) of the characters and scenarios is good and makes
for good satire of sorts.<br /><br />The central relationship between Jake and Jesus is also worked well through
several key scenes throughout the film.  It leaves questions open during the
film and at the end, but I guess there aren't always answers for everything
and that's the way it is.  The dynamic between the two is good though and it
makes for an interesting plot &#150; even though it does often feel like a
subplot behind the basketball stuff.  Other bits of the film don't fare as
well.  The two romantic strands are not as good as they should be &#150;
certainly Jake's scenes with Dakota are less than inspiring.<br /><br />The cast are all pretty good.  Allen does OK but occasionally looks out of
his depth with the talented cast.  The array of basketball players and
associates all add colour whether as themselves or playing characters. 
Washington carries the majority of the film and shows his ability in a
difficult role &#150; he became the heart of the film for me even though I'm sure
the intention was for that to be Jesus.  Dawson plays well despite being eye
candy for the majority, she does have better scenes near the end of the
film.  The support cast have a few Lee regulars including an amusing
Turturro, a convincing Palagonia and a blink and you'll miss her Jennifer
Esposito.<br /><br />Overall this is not a perfect film as it overstretches itself a little and
doesn't manage to deal with everything as well as it could have done. 
Ironically the overstretching is also a plus point as, every time I watch
it, it gives me something else to concentrate on.  Not Lee's finest work but
a good film about his other passion with plenty of other stuff thrown in
behind it.
