1999_August 3 

He Got Game is a very good piece of work by Spike Lee.  This movie kept my
attention from beginning to end.  The performances by Denzel Washington,
Ray
Allen, and Bill Nunn(leech uncle) were very good.  I felt that the sex was
an integral part of the movie because I believe that this is TRULY one of
the lures that a college would use to hook a star player to attend their
school.<br /><br />Jesus was the anchor of sanity in his world of leeches and hanger-ons.  I
didn't find the script weak like some of the other reviewers.  However the
one quibble that I do have with the film is the ending-which did leave me
scratching my head trying to understand the symbolism behind it.  Overall
it
rates a 9.8 on my review scale.
