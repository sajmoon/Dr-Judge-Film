1998_December 1 

The film has its moments, but for the most part it rattles around from place
to place, relies on some fairly stupid cliches, and (as usual with Spike
Lee) treats women like dirt. In fact, the only real function of women in
this film is to (a) take off their shirts, (b) die, (c) take off their
shirts, (d) take off their shirts. Oh, yeah, there's a hooker with a heart
of gold (who takes off her shirt), and a great-looking teenage gold-digger
(who takes off her shirt). And some entirely gratuitous white girls with
huge breasts (who take off their shirts, duh).<br /><br />And then ends with a completely out-of-character, inexplicable cliche so, I
guess, we can feel a little better about some of the characters (because
most of them are jerks).<br /><br />This is the same guy who made the documentary about the little girls killed
in Birmingham? You have to be kidding!
