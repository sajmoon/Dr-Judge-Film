1998_October 22 

I had to remind myself several times Denzel Washington was an actor and that
he was playing a character named Jake Shuttlesworth--his performance is that
good. I'd give him the Academy Award for Best Actor. I'm serious--he's
amazing.
In terms of the film, it isn't quite good enough to support his performance.
(We are expected to believe there's no one looking out for Jesus [everyone
in the film has an ulterior motive], and Jesus himself is too much of a
saint.)
Definitely worth watching, though--any Spike Lee film usually is. But I'm
annoyed at Lee: he's too good a director to insert the MTV-style shots in
this film. Unlike so many who have tried to cover basketball before,
however, Lee knows the game.
This gives (the all-white) Hoosiers a run for its money as the best
basketball film&#133; of course, there isn't much competition.
