He got game is an exceptional story about a basketball player who
quarrels with family issues and strives towards his dream. Directed by
Spike Lee, this movie takes an in depth look at exactly how many
variables are involved when being the MVP, and how a man can grow up
and assess these circumstances.<br /><br />Ray Allen plays a character who's name is Jesus Shuttlesworth. At a
young age, his father pressed him dramatically to be the best he could
be. However by mistake kills Jesus's mother and is sent to prison. The
troubled child eventually grows up to become one for the best players
in the nation. Now the drama builds up. When the decision to go pro or
join a college team is just around the corner, Jesus's father (played
by Denzel Washington) is let out of jail to convert his son to a
specific school or else the father is returned to jail, it leaves Jesus
with a daunting task. The reconcile between the father and son is what
eventually allows Jesus to become a real man and face his problems.<br /><br />The idea that a boy cannot live without his father plays a defined role
in this movie. Jesus grows up with the responsibilities of taking care
of his sister, who is several years younger than he is. While it
appears that Jesus has all of the support in the world, Spike Lee does
a terrific job of accentuating how they are really leeches. All the
people want are money, fame, and fortune; which is all possible through
Jesus. The reason the father plays such a key role is because although
he needs Jesus's help, he isn't interested in that. He really loves his
son.<br /><br />Although Spike Lee did some amazing work with this movie especially
with the inner city sequences, as well as the use of colors and poetry
to his advantage for getting his ideas across to the audience, several
scenes were unneeded which seemed overly explicit. Although these are
truly issues that can ruin a famous person, they seemed almost too
graphic to be seen by a general audience. What Spike does so well is
keeping the real connections with the street, and enabling the audience
to see exactly what the character is going through by using several
techniques. <br /><br />Colors in the movie such as red, green, and black symbolize power,
pain, and respect between different characters. While Jesus hates his
name, his father named him that through a basketball player that was
how he put it, &quot;the truth.&quot; This movie proves that in real life, you
can benefit more by forgiving, and not forgetting.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a
unique, intellectual film that will make you think about your present
situation, as well as allowing you to know the difficulties that come
with fame.
