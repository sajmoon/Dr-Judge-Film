1998's &quot;He Got Game&quot; once again teams up Spike Lee with Denzel
Washington. Jesus Shuttlesworth (NBA all-star Ray Allen) is America's
most sought after high school basketball prospect. His father Jake
Shuttlesworth (Washington), is serving time in prison for killing
Jesus's mother (Lonette McKee) The warden tells Jake that the governor
wants his son (Jesus) to go to college at his alma mater, Big State. If
Jesus does go, Jake's time in prison will be cut shorter. So Jake gets
parole and goes to Coney Island to convince his son to go to Big State.
At the same time, he wants to heal his estranged relationship with his
son. &quot;He Got Game&quot; is a powerful film. The performance by Washington is
great, not Oscar worthy, but great. &quot;He Got Game&quot; also marked the
&quot;mainstream&quot; film debut of Rosario Dawson. The film's score consists of
Aaron Copland and Public Enemy giving the film a huge plus. Aside from
the father-son storyline, we see the greed that goes on in the world of
sports (Spike just had to put out a social statement in this film, not
that it's bad) We also see Jake's relationship with an attractive
prostitute (Milla Jovovich) &quot;He Got Game&quot; is another proof of Spike's
talent. This wasn't your average Spike Lee joint. There was a dark and
gritty feeling to this one. Either way, it was still enjoyable and is
highly recommended for basketball fans like myself.<br /><br />He Got Game- rated R ***1/2 out of ****
