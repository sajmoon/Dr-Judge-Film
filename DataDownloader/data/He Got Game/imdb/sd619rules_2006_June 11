This movie is so much better than anything Spike Lee has ever done-with
maybe one exception-although the story could have been tightened up and
shortened (delete the Denzel/Hooker scenes) it still hits the mark with
all pistons pumping full blast. Anyone that says this movie lacks heart
or does not have a story to tell does not know anything about movies.
Spike Lee has a story to tell here-and he tells it with amazing
commitment.<br /><br />Ray Allen puts on such a top notch performance in the pic that I am
shocked I have never seen him again since, although being an NBA
superstar might have something to do with that.<br /><br />Denzel, what can you say, he kicks ass. His role is one where you think
he is a big bully, but under the bully mentality is the goal of
building a better life for his kid. Did he make mistakes in
life-yes....is he still making mistakes while out of prison
furlough-yes....but there is more to his role than that-and Denzel hits
the mark.<br /><br />Fantastic movie.
