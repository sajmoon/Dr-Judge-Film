This film essentially tries to show a very natural and normal occurrence:
of
an unsuccessful basketball player trying to force his son to
succeed.<br /><br />The aftermath is tragical, but quite realistic. The film, amongst other
things is a showcase of the excellent acting of Denzel Washington. He
manages to transform from a timid docile man into the beast which he really
was before he went to jail in a very subtle and intelligent way. The
orchestra music, which accompanies the film, is a nice touch, because
otherwise one would expect rap music in a film about a poor black
neighborhood. The film is intense, and doesn't leave much space for
thinking
(but, of course, you have the whole night afterwards, so who's
complaining?).<br /><br />One of the funny hiccups is that the father doesn't tell his son about why
he had named him Jesus until their reunion (and he had many opportunities
to
say that earlier). The aggressive sex scenes are too many and too violent
for my taste. If they were meant to show us how difficult it is to become a
succesful basketball player, then Lee should have put other equally
dangerous &quot;habits&quot;, such as drugs, alcohol, etc. in equal
amounts.<br /><br />Anyway, the ending is fantastic, and it DOES tell a message. Watch the
film,
and you will see what I am talking about.
