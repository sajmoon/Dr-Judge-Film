Convicted felon Jake Shuttlesworth (Denzel Washington) receives a one week
release from prison to convince his son (Ray Allen)--America's top prep
basketball player--to attend the governor's college alma mater.  Promising
premise and able cast are sold short by a plot that incessantly indulges
in
gratuitous (and completely unrelated) sex and nudity.  Even with the
single-note moral points on fatherhood and temptation pummelled home in an
obvious, unimaginative fashion, the film practically sinks to exploitation
level.  Spike Lee's colorful, stylish cinematography and Washington's
usual,
solid performance make this one bearable.
