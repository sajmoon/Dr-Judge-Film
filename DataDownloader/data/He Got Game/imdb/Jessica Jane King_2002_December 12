Well known for his style and method of story telling, Spike Lee
directed another great movie, He Got Game, a creative and
different way to tell a story.  The story is about the pressures and
influences placed on Jesus, a high school basketball player, by
agents, coaches, family, and friends due to his impressive
on-
court abilities that lead him on a path of self-evaluation relative to
others.  His father, Denzel Washington, has been allowed a week
from prison to convince his son, played by Ray Allen, to attend `Big
State,' in order for his sentence to be reduced.  Despite
controversy and many worldly temptations, Jesus, a character of
good virtue, stays true to his sister, his family, and most
importantly, his father.  The choppy editing creates a disturbing
feeling throughout, and the two hours and fifteen minutes seems
to drag at times.  Overall, though, the film is original, well done,
and remarkable; it does not leave you with any new aspects on life
or with any visions of changing the world, but it is worth seeing
because you could learn a little something about forgiveness.   <br /><br />
