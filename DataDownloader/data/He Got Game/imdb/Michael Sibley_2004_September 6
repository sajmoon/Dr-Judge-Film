Denzel Washington and Ray Allen were excellent but other than that I
didn't really think this film worked. <br /><br />The plot was simple enough: convince your son to go to a certain
college and you will get reduced time off your sentence. I expected
Spike Lee to do a b job with bringing father and son closer together. I
fear Spike Lee &quot;He Got Game&quot; for several reasons and none of them
include giving the audience a good product <br /><br />Another problem that this film has is the fact that it has more than
enough graphic sexual content and language. It could have been a lot
better if the sexual content and some of the language were edited out
of the script.<br /><br />With the exception of the two leads, basketball stars such as Rick Fox
and Walter McCarty overshadowed the rest of the cast. For this reason
alone, I would recommend &quot;He Got Game.&quot;
