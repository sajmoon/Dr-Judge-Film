              Enjoyed the great acting of Denzel Washington(Jake
Shuttlesworth),&quot;The Bone Collector&quot;,'99, who played a very complicated
character role as a murderer who killed his wife who he really LOVED! A
father to his daughter and a son he adored and trained hard to become a
great Basketball Super Star like Michael Jordan.  Denzel made it look easy,
but try to act out the great role he portrayed.   The film locations were
great in Coney Island,(Brooklyn), NY and the Cabrini-Green in Chicago,
Illinois.  Ray Allen(Jesus),&quot;Harvard Man&quot;,01 was a great supporting actor
and his talent should be seen more often.  Jake tried to help Milla
Jovovich(Dakota Burns),&quot;Dummy&quot;,02 who was a prostitute and warmed to the
friendship that Jake offered to her with no strings attached!   This is a
very deep and meaningful film which has great moralistic lessons to offer
the audience.
