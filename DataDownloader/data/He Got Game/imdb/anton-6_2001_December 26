Spike Lee is a good director and he has made some great films but I could
hardly watch this film.The acting was awful even by Denzel Wahington and the
sex scenes are silly.It tries to be raging bull but honestly it is trash.The
only thing that is good is the basketball scenes.Then the end I guess is the
worst of all times.Why did Spike Lee made this film?????? Well I forgive him
and forget about this film and instead watch his other great
films.1/5
