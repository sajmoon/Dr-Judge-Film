Spike Lee returns to familiar themes for this basketball drama, in which a
talented young black man desperately seeks to escape from the black ghetto
he has been brought up in.  Such an overriding theme is almost identical to
that of his previous venture 'Clockers'.<br /><br />Lee teams up with Washington for the first time since their successful
collaboration on the Malcolm X biopic.  The actor plays the jailed father of
basketball genius, Jesus Shuttleworth, who is ruthless in his attempt to
ensure that his son escapes the ghetto through the sport.  However, what
also becomes clear is that his motives are not entirely unselfish in that he
also puts the hopes of the entire family upon the boy's
shoulders.<br /><br />The son understandably resents his father; in fact it's a wonder he has any
contact with him at all considering the crime he was put away for!  Whilst
the resentment towards his father may be justifiable, we also see that he
feels that he is unable to succeed without turning his back on the
neighbourhood which reared him.  An example of this is when he breaks off
from his relationship with his childhood sweetheart after we see him
cheating on her with some white college bimbos.<br /><br />However, Lee doesn't seem critical of the youth's ruthless desire, on the
contrary the narrative seems quite sympathetic towards him as we watch him
being pulled from all angles as to where his future should lie by people who
have only their own vested interests in mind.  Lee tries to focus on the
fact that a young black man such as Jesus has very little choice even when
it would appear from the outside that he has the world at his feet. <br /><br />The situation of Jesus' character reminded me much of Morris Chestnut's
Ricky in John Singleton's 'Boyz N The Hood', who was tragically destroyed by
his society before he could escape.  Unlike the football hopeful in
Singleton's earlier film, Lee's basketball hopeful is prepared to trample on
those closest to him to reach the lure of riches.  Like the character of
Flipper in Lee's 'Jungle Fever' he succumbs, all be it in a less literal
way, to the white temptation and thus damages his own black roots.  By
placing his father as the film's central protagonist we gain a first hand
perspective of the potential harm.<br /><br />Basketball, a sport traditionally dominated by Afro-Americans, offers the
ideal symbol for Lee's thought provoking critique of the flawed
Afro-American Dream.<br /><br />
