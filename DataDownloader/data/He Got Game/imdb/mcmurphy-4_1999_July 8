1999_July 8 

This is Spike Lee's finest work in a long time.  Personal, moving,
well-told.  It touched me more deeply than any other movie last year.
(Well, &quot;Babe: Pig in the City&quot; came close.)  Fine work all around from the
cast and crew.  The single shot cemetery scene will devastate you.  A
truly
spiritual, emotional, wonderful film.  (The only flaw is the superfluous
and
badly-delivered monologue about mid-way through the film.  The writing is
pretty good, the visuals are terrific, but the actor is not up to the
task.)
