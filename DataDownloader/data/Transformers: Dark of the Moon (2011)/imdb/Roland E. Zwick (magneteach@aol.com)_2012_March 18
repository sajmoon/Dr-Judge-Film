I realize that the &#x22;Transformer&#x22; movies are generally regarded as the
non plus ultra of soulless commercial movie-making and that their
popularity is supposed to presage the very demise of Cinema itself as
an art form. But such an assessment fails to take into account the
movies&#x27; sense of high-spirited fun, their playful wit and their
over-the-top but sometimes amusing caricatures, human and otherwise (I
can&#x27;t speak for the universally reviled second installment, which I
haven&#x27;t seen).<br /><br />Part 3, &#x22;Transformers: Dark of the Moon,&#x22; starts with a clever premise:
that the original lunar landing was really just an elaborate,
for-public-consumption-only ruse to launch a covert operation to
explore a spaceship - the one carrying the initial wave of autobots -
that had recently crash landed on the surface of the moon. Now a new
race of evil bots, known as Decepticons, are becoming activated,
threatening to destroy the good bots and take over the earth for their
own nefarious purposes.<br /><br />On the human side, young Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) may have saved the
world in the past, but he still can&#x27;t find a job. But mere unemployment
can&#x27;t keep an honest-to-goodness, dyed-in-the-wool hero from saving
humanity once again after the evil creatures pretty much raze Chicago
in a literal scorched-earth policy of rampant death and destruction.<br /><br />The one saving grace of the &#x22;Transformer&#x22; movies - which would indeed
otherwise be the epitome of soulless movie machines - has been their
sense of humor, their refusal to take themselves too seriously
(especially the first one). Unfortunately, the wit and fleet-footedness
of the first half of &#x22;Dark of the Moon&#x22; dribbles away in a welter of
overwrought CGI effects and self-congratulatory seriousness towards the
end. And LaBeouf gets stuck playing romantic lead to any number of
automatons: his metallic buddies and his flesh-and-blood girlfriend
Carly Spencer - and he isn&#x27;t too terribly convincing in either role.
But as an action comedy superhero, the kid definitely brings the
agility and skills necessary to get the job done. Which pretty much
describes the film itself, come to think of it.
