So this movie starts out with a quick and lazy back-story narrated by
none other (shock &#x26; awe) than Optimus Prime. His dialog makes no sense
and is just a poor excuse to conveniently give the audience the bare
backbone of a plot just to get this film rolling. Now although the
&#x22;Rise of the Fallen&#x22; was a complete disaster, I will give it props for
at least having a plot it could build up to. Was it a good plot? No.
But at least it was a plot the movie could stay true to all the way to
the credits. To tell you the truth I didn&#x27;t know what the hell to think
of this movie. It had no real direction at all. It virtually had no
connection to the previous two and sorta just expected us to go with
the pathetic storyline that progressively got worse and worse as the
movie went on.<br /><br />My main problem with the story of Transfomers all together is the fact
that after three films, I still don&#x27;t know who the story is about. The
first film intertwined the two lives of the auto-bots and Sam Witwicki
fairly well, but starting with the second film the one road sorta hit a
fork where it went two separate directions. Now we have this &#x22;Sam
Witwiki&#x22; story, and this &#x22;auto-bots&#x22; story, and as a member of the
audience I have no idea which one I should be more focused on. &#x22;Dark of
the Moon&#x22; literally jumps from the auto-bots dealing with some dumb
plot involving one of their fallen com-rads from the war on Cybertron,
to Sam Witwiki having trouble with finding a job and dealing with his
new girlfriend and him getting jealous over some rich guy who is
hitting on his new girlfriend and problems with his parents and the
fact that his car wont start or whatever. &#x22;ONCE AGAIN&#x22; Sam is a perfect
example of an introductory protagonist. He is a character that is down
on his luck and is in a tough point in his life. But you may have
notice how I emphasized on the &#x22;ONCE AGAIN&#x22; part. My point is that we
have already dealt with this character before. Bay has recycled a
character trait of a typical protagonist twice around now. The first
time was in the first film where Sam was having trouble being socially
accepted in high school. It&#x27;s impossible to learn anything new about
Sam&#x27;s character because Bay won&#x27;t give us anything new. This just makes
me scratch my head in confusion as to why Sam is even in the movie
anymore at all. Sure, he was an essential team player in the first
installment, however at this point in the game his entire character has
run out of steam. The only reason he is even needed in this movie is
because Bay conveniently shoe horned him in here. He gets sucked into
the auto-bot plot when he discovers that the guy that is trying to
steal his girlfriend away is actually a human ally of the decepticons.
Which brings me to my next point of irritation: &#x22;Plot Convenience&#x22;. Now
typically there is always a bit of plot convenience with every film,
however depending on how complex the awfulness of the movie is will
determine how obvious these fallacies are. Stupid little elements that
stick out here and there throughout the entire movie just to get it
exactly where the director wants it to go. It&#x27;s all part of the plan
for the series of event to fall into place so we can get to the dull,
consequence free, mind-numbing, CGI over-substance action scenes that
no one over the age of 14 really cares about. I coined the phrase
&#x22;boring destruction.&#x22; It probably wont take off, but my point that a
lot of these movies have these action scenes that don&#x27;t have any
conflict. All these robots are having a final showdown and the entire
city is getting blown to high heaven. But the problem is that even
though the special effects ain&#x27;t bad, nothing is really at stake for me
to even care. There is no consideration for the average Joe going to
work when all this crazy sh*t starts going down. Without any
consideration for people the audience can relate to, the tension in the
movie dissolves. Without tension and suspense for the possibility of
real loss in a movie, there is no story. So the conclusion behind this
critique is that Transformers 3 doesn&#x27;t have a real story to it. So
what good is it!? <br /><br />Let me just throw something out there. This was a &#x22;bad&#x22; movie. The way
I rate a bad movie is simply by how much it did not entertain me. This
movie was literally a chore to sit through. Because the bottom line is
that any story can be good. It just depends on how its told. The people
who made this movie were not focused on a story, and that is precisely
why it didn&#x27;t work. All the fake explosions and cool CGI
transformations in the world don&#x27;t stand a chance against a well told
story.
