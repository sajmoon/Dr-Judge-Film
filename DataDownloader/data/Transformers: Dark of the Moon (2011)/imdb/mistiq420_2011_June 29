Saw the Pre-screening last night in 3D n all i can say was WOW...The
effects...the plot..the characters. Absolute Masterpiece... I love
critics because there gonna look at this movie n say oh it needed this
or oh it lacked that! Screw that! This movie was meant to be watched
the same way we all watched it as kids sitting in front of our tiny
turn nob color TVs on Saturday mornings watching the epic battle
between Autobots n Decepticons. What im trying to say is this movie
wasn&#x27;t just made to make the big bucks which it definitely will but
this movie was made for the fans of the series itself and only a true
fan will appreciate what Mr.Bay has done for us. Allow yourself to be a
child again and i guarantee you will leave that theater clapping The 3D
really made this movie even better then it already is. I would go as
far as saying if you don&#x27;t watch it in 3D your really missing out.
