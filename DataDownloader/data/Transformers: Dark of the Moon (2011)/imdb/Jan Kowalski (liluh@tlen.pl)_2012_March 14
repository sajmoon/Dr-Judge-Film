There has been a lot of discussions about this movie so I will try to
keep it short.<br /><br />I will first describe what I didn&#x27;t like in the movie, and then move on
to the good parts and things I liked.<br /><br />First of all - lovely Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. She is gorgeous, but
she can&#x27;t play. At least she didn&#x27;t in this movie. I bet she tried, but
what we have is just horrible, and there&#x27;s absolutely no chemistry
between her and Shia Lebeouf&#x27;s to the point I couldn&#x27;t actually believe
that Witwicky digs her character. It really bothered me throughout the
movie. I mean, we have Turturro who overdoes his part but for one I&#x27;m
fond of him, and two - he does that deliberately and winks to the
audience while doing it. I understand that, it&#x27;s just an action-figure
movie. Yet what Rosie delivers is dramatic, and would be in anything
more than, let&#x27;s say, a Brazilian TV soap opera.<br /><br />Sigh. Alright, let&#x27;s move forward. I&#x27;ll just point out that the story,
while making more sense than in the previous part, is still rather so -
so. While everything is fine with the dark side of the moon and the
general core of the plot, there are little inconsequences and simply
daft scenario cuts that make it, at times, just disturbing to watch
(whole issue of government handling the situation, Malkovic and Jeong
characters). Not to mention we are lead by the hand throughout whole
movie so while there are some major twists - you just can&#x27;t be
surprised when they finally happen.<br /><br />So what&#x27;s good? As always - humor and visuals. I mean the battle at
second part of the movie is truly epic. The mega-mecha-worm cutting
through buildings, the air scenes with skydivers, dang, those are some
really creative effects that were never tried before in any other
action movie, and they are top quality too.<br /><br />So why rate it so high? 7/10.<br /><br />C&#x27;mon, it&#x27;s a movie about giant robots! Let&#x27;s not expect too much from
it.
