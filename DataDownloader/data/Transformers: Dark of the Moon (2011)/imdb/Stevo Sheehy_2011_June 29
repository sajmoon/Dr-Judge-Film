After the critical back-lashing Revenge of the Fallen, Michael bay
stated that the third and possibly final Transformers would take away
everything that failed in the last movie and give the audience what it
wanted. But has he learned his lessons? Yes and no. Gone are the
racially insensitive robots, the incredibly messy and clumsy plotting
and much of the dizzying, incomprehensible camera-work. What remains is
the poor geeky humour and questionable performances from the leads.
Shia Labeouf was very enjoyable in the first movie but here has gone
into overdrive, and his character Sam Witwicky has become much less
relatable and interesting. His home life in particular (of which the
first half of the movie focuses) is getting irritating. His girlfriend
problems and embarrassing parents boring and we really couldn&#x27;t care
that much about how he feels unappreciated for saving the world twice.
Then there&#x27;s Megan Fox&#x27;s replacement: Rosie Huntington-Whitely. She
can&#x27;t act. At all. It wasn&#x27;t expected that the former model would be
that great but she really is poor.<br /><br />The first hour of the film is much like Rosie. Nice to look at
(especially in 3D) but lacking any substance at all. We are left with
Ken Jeong doing his Hangover thing in a 12A film, and not being funny,
just very annoying. And John Malkovich doing his thing but really just
embarrassing himself. There are reams of exposition, while the plot is
better than the last two films it is still handed out poorly. Bay won&#x27;t
let the action tell the story, it has to be action, break, story,
break, action. The rest of the first hour is just CGI and Shia going
mental while Rosie watches blankly.<br /><br />But all of a sudden the supporting comic actors are dropped and Michael
Bay does what he does best: Explosions and fighting. An impressive
freeway chase leading into a fight a plot twist (yes a plot twist in a
Transformers movie) and a death of a significant character. The whole
film gets better from here. The plotting gets tighter, John Tuturro and
Frances McDormand are given more screen-time (there were so many Coen
favourites in this movie I was expecting John Goodman to be voicing an
Autobot) and the action is dished out in spades. Whe the decepticons
invade Chicago all hell breaks loose. And we are given fights, battles,
explosions and collapsing buildings galore. Robots kick, punch and rip
each other apart. And this is where the third dimension comes into
play. This is definitely the best 3D experience since Avatar. Watch in
awe as Optimus Prime tears chunks of metal out of other giant robots
and chucks them at the screen while in the depths of the background,
aerial battles ensue. It is breathtaking and a triumph for 3D, proving
that it can be done properly and amaze the viewer.<br /><br />If you went an hour late to the movie, and make sure it&#x27;s a 3D
screening, this would be a 5 star experience of pure entertainment. But
as it stands it&#x27;s still a solid closer for the trilogy, an improvement
on Revenge of the fallen but not as good as the first.
