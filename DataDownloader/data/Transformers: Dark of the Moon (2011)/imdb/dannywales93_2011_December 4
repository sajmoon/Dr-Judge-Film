2011_December 4 
This is really good movie and yes it does have its flaws, but what
movie does not? These films are more focused on CGI and action. The
plot is smart and is not to hard to follow. I think all of the people
are likable in this film. Even though i do miss Megan Fox. As the new
actress who plays Carly adds nothing to the film, but like in most
action movie, you need a bit of eye candy and a female lead. The action
is amazing in my eyes. And the script is not as bad as people make out.
But i think it suits the film. People slate this film for all reasons.
But is a classic in its own ways. It is just a good fun film. If you
want you want a serious film, go watch inception or the godfather. But
if you let yourself get in to this film, you will have a blast. I would
say its one of the best films of 2011.
