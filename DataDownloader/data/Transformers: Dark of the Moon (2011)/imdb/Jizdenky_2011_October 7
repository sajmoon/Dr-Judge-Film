This is as bad as it could get. What an insult to the transformers
image. &#x27;Transformers: Dark of the Moon&#x27;. With the departure of Megan
Hox I expected to see a better actress who looks hot. However, the
replacement chick, Rosie Huntington-Whitley, who looks as though she
just walked out of an underwear catalogue, doesn&#x27;t add much. The movie
starts off dreadfully. The attempt at creating a historical link is
ridiculously bad. There is very little action and the few that you get
to see is unimpressive. The supposed &#x27;comedy&#x27; parts do not amuse at
all. Only Julie White manages to draw some giggles. Shia LaBeouf is
irritating. He seems to have reached a new level of overacting. John
Malkovich, Frances McDormand and John Torturro are wasted in horrible
roles with very limited screenspace. While most of the human characters
are dull, another major disappointment is that you won&#x27;t get to see
much of the Transformers Michael Bay has a reputation of making
expensive lavish with no heart. &#x27;Transformers: Dark of the Moon&#x27;
definitely fits in that category.
