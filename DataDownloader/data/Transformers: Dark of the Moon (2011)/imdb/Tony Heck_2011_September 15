&#x22;There will be days when we lose faith, days when our allies turn
against us. But the day will never come, that we forsake this planet
and its people.&#x22; Once again Sam (LeBeouf) is stuck in the middle of
trying to have a normal life and saving the world. After a &#x22;lost&#x22;
autobot is brought back to life Optimus Prime thinks peace has come at
last. The decepticons have other plans. After the huge success of the
first movie the producers decided to make a second, with out a real
plot in place and it showed. Taking a little more time in developing
this one also showed. Like &#x22;X-Men&#x22; the background of this movie is
historically real. Like any Michael Bay movie this is a movie that is
based on special effects and explosions with little attention payed to
emotion or story. I will give him one scene that was pretty emotional
though. That said, not many people go into a movie like this for the
acting or plot. The action and special effects were very good and this
was a very exciting movie and very fun to watch. Overall, much, much,
much, much better then the second one. Not quite as good as the first,
but it&#x27;s close. I give it a B+.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - Yes I will.<br /><br />*Also try - Transformers 1 &#x26; 2
