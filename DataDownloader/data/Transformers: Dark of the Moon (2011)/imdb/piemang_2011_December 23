OH MY GOD this was bad. I thought the first Transformers movie was
trashy, the second one was terrible, but this really took the cake. If
you really want to regrettably lose two hours of your life, then go
ahead and watch this film.<br /><br />The story is woeful even on Transformer&#x27;s standards. There is no
explanation as to what happened to Megan Fox. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley
is thrust upon us with her big fake lips and without a gram of acting
ability. Sam Witwicky is a massive tool as always, his parents were
really annoying just as they were in the other two, and I cannot begin
to describe how awful Frances McDormand was. Frances McDormand is about
the only person in this film with any serious credibility and I would
think more highly of her if she had gone out with Lindsay Lohan on a
drug induced night of mayhem than appear in this.<br /><br />Tyrese Gibson was about the only person enjoyable to watch, and if it
wasn&#x27;t for his charm then I really would have hung myself during this
monstrosity of &#x22;story&#x22;.<br /><br />I&#x27;m so disappointed in Leonard Nimoy.
