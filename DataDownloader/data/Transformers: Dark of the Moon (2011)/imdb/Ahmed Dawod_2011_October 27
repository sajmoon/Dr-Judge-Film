This movie is AWESOME. I actually don&#x27;t know why so many people are
criticizing the movie this bad, or why the movie is rated 6.5 only?????
Every thing in the movie elements is fantastic (ie. Graphics, fights,
story, acting and production)<br /><br />In my opinion, the hero of this movie is &#x22;Garrett Warren&#x22; the fight
choreographer (and if there are more). The fights are amazing and very
very exciting. Those men have really shown their creativity in
designing the fights&#x27; moves. especially for &#x22;Bumble Bee&#x22; and &#x22;Optimus&#x22;
fights.<br /><br />The Special Effects are very amazing and crazy. The graphic designs are
perfect. The music of the movie is really great. <br /><br />I still can&#x27;t understand why people didn&#x27;t like the movie !!!!!!!!
