Although packed with action sequences and robot fighting, Transformers
3 plot leaves a lot to be desired. Involving a return of a almighty
leader (Sentinel) that&#x27;s relatively equal to Rasilon&#x27;s in Doctor Who,
the story continues to duplicate End of Time&#x27;s revival of a long lost
planet, Gallifrey (Cybertron) into Earth&#x27;s orbit. One of the main
villains(Megatron); The Master, saves the protagonist(Optimus Prime),
The Doctor by attacking the antagonist, Rasilon (Sentinel). After the
final batle when the planet, Gallifrey (Cybertron) goes back to its
death, Transformers 3 even goes to utilize the Doctor Who, legendary
4-beat drumming, although slightly altered.
