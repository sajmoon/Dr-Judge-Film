I grew up on Transformers, and this movie was quite mediocre as the
previous two. The action is great and well executed, but it&#x27;s still
lacking focus on the transformers - which are more interesting than the
human story. The boy&#x27;s story is boring and uninteresting, and the new
girl is clearly here to shut up and look beautiful. I personally don&#x27;t
like Rosie, her face is filled with too much silicon.<br /><br />I&#x27;d still recommend watching it in the theaters - it&#x27;s a fun action
packed film. It&#x27;s just too bad Michael Bay makes us watch boring and
ridiculous stories about the humans. And no, I don&#x27;t care about the
chick in the film. This isn&#x27;t James Bond, Michael.
