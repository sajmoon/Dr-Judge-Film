If your seeking a film with an impeccable story, great plot and
progressive character development..... this is definitely NOT that sort
of film. Then again if you aren&#x27;t aware of Micheal Bay&#x27;s reputation of
an all action and special effects based style of direction than you
probably don&#x27;t go to the movies a whole lot. That being said it is in
my opinion that this film is nothing short of brilliant. Micheal Bays
days of shooting car advertisements have really paid off in these three
films and in particular this last installment of the trilogy
(Transformers: Dark of the moon). The film lives up to everything I
expected, the special effects are amazing, the action is fantastic the
Computer Generated Imagery is perfect and to even add onto that the 3D
experience is just incredible. I actually think I appreciated the film
a lot more watching it in 3D. Like in particular the scenes where
Shockwave&#x27;s pet mechanical leech rips through the commercial buildings
and the deployment of the airborne military troops in particular are
quite astounding. Though as much as the action was fantastic and nail
biting at times. The story is pretty simple and predictable as you
would expect. I don&#x27;t care though, I don&#x27;t need story for a bunch of
robots, just as long as their motives justify their means to blow $%*#
up, I&#x27;ll be happy to watch it to see what happens. <br /><br />So that being said do me a favor and grab an energy drink and head on
down to your local cinema and buy a 3d ticket for transformers.Its one
of the only 3D films out that will get you the experience you would be
expecting and if your not to keen on an all action based film than its
probably time to watch &#x22;The Departed&#x22; again
