What an Awful display of commercialized cinema, playing to the tunes of
all the wrong stereotypes. A horrible waste of time, effort and money,
specially since a lot of effort must have gone into the graphics only
to produce this distasteful parody of sorts. This is what you get when
you make a movie without passion or substance. Anyway, I intended to
ask this question since the first part. What is the point of having a
chick running around in these types of movies? Really, is it necessary
to have some chick in skimpy clothes romancing around with metal
crashing on metal in the background ? Unless off-course you wanted to
woo schoolgirls in to watch the movie. My serious advise is, if you
have to finish with watching the 3rd installment, rent it. That way you
can fast forward through all those disgusting chick flick scenes and
watch what you paid for.
