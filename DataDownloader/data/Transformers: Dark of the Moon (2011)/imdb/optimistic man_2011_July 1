thank you Michael bay! for actually trying with this movie like the
first one, and it shows. Finally I felt the &#x22;spark&#x22; i felt four years
ago when i first watched the first transformers.there is way more
character development in this one, for the humans and for the robots.Go
see it in 3d, it was the best 3d experience so far in my life.And don&#x27;t
get angry about no Megan fox, go into the movie with an open mind, and
you will forget all about her. one of the best theatrical experiences
ever in my opinion, don&#x27;t wait until DVD/blu ray, this was a movie
meant to be watched in theaters.others things like acting, dialogue and
comedy have also been improved, because this movie is much more serious
and emotional.
