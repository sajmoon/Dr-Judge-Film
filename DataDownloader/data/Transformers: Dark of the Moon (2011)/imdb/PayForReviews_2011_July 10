I must say i really did enjoy the special effects in the movie but they
were most definitely the best part of it , the script writing is
terrible, and the actors need to go back to acting school.The large
numbers of Deceptacon&#x27;s on the moon isn&#x27;t explained. and sometimes when
the story gets slow, they introduce characters to help drag it along,
only for the characters to be killed off 10 minutes later. For the 3rd
time in the series, Bumblebee&#x27;s life is threatened, for the 3rd time,
Sam looks on in terror as his friend Bumblebee is about to die while
the same sad music plays on in the background as the previous two of
their movies, and for the third time in this series, Bumblebee is
miraculously saved by characters that were barely seen for thirty
minutes before hand. I&#x27;m all for mindless action movies, but this one
maybe a bit too mindless. .
