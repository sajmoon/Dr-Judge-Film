If you liked the first two, you&#x27;ll probably like this, it&#x27;s not quite
as awesome as the first one, but a bit better than the second, I think.<br /><br />It was standard explosions and slow motion robots. There were a couple
times I laughed so hard I cried a little, once at something John
Malkovich did and another time at something rather absurd and
ridiculous.<br /><br />Acting wise it was alright, and there were a couple of minor twists I
wasn&#x27;t expecting, some scenes ran on a little long, but it was okay. I
saw it in 3D and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay for it because I don&#x27;t feel that
the 3D effects were that mind-blowing or wow-ing.
