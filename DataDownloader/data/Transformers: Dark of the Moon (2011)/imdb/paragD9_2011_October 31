Third part in transformers trilogy what i have expected full of action
and good camera work and heavy special effects once again Mr. Michael
Bay proved it that he is the Master of Modern Epic Action Science
Fiction Films.I am glad he used very heavy and high definition cameras.
Transformers Trilogy is feast for my eyes and action pack trilogy very
rare and unique script and direction and composer Steve jablonsky has
done a great job.It shows that sometimes truth and humanity does not
come easily we have to be active and full of action.I have seen all the
films directed by Mr Michael Bay and he is my favorite director and it
is the first film of Mr Micheal Bay to exceed 1 billion it is the most
appreciated film according to fans all around the world.
