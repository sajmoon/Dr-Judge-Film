I don&#x27;t know why the world seems to hate me. Before I saw this movie, I
saw tons of reviews saying that this film was a fun, action packed
movie, with great visuals, and a plot that actually wasn&#x27;t that bad. I
see the movie, actually really like it, then when I get home, I get on
my computer, and all I can find are reviewers bashing the film. I mean
seriously, spill.com gave this a low rental, two some ol&#x27; bulls**t, and
a f**k you. Richard roper recently said it was the worst movie he had
seen all year, despite the fact that he had given the film a D and
given at least two other movies a D- and at least one film and F.<br /><br />I won&#x27;t say the film is perfect, even though I couldn&#x27;t find any, I&#x27;m
sure there were at least a few plot holes. Some of the humor didn&#x27;t
work, and it is at least 30 minutes too long.<br /><br />I basically went into this movie expecting great action and effects,
and I got that, but there actually were other things I liked in this
movie. For example I did laugh quite a bit, some of the humor actually
did work for me. And yes, I actually liked the characters. I can&#x27;t say
I really loved any of them, most of them are just forgettable, but Sam
Witwicky I did find to be enjoyable. It&#x27;s weird, I should hate him, but
Shia LaBeaof takes a character I should hate and makes him likable,
where were you on that one Jeremy Renner.<br /><br />And the plot actually isn&#x27;t that bad, the last half of the movie is
pretty much not stop action. And like I said, I didn&#x27;t see any plot
holes.<br /><br />There are some people who absolutely hate this movie, and to me, they
either focus on one negative aspect and exploit it, like Richard
Roeper. Or they can&#x27;t stop living in the 80s, like Spill.com or Brad
Jones. I don&#x27;t really care what Spoony says because I was never really
a fan of his. If you do have a strong hatred for this movie, please
explain why, what makes this really worse than Season of the Witch, or
Battle: LA? Overall, it is a very stupid movie, but it&#x27;s a fun, very
stupid movie.<br /><br />Whether you like them or not, I guess there are two things you can&#x27;t
deny about the the live action Transformers movies, one, they have
incredible special effects, and two, they are very stupid.
