We are now up to the third installment of the action-packed franchise.
Is this Transformers also stupid? Yes. Does it still have stupid
characters doing idiotic things? Yes. Does it still have Optimus Prime
disappearing throughout most the film and still not being quite as
bad-arse as his cartoon 80s days? Yes. Is Michael Bay still dropping
the ball as director? Yes. Does the franchise still not know how to
have a decent ending? Yes. And finally, does it still have this
overgrossing obsession about the military? Yes. Despite all this, we
have clearly found our best entry in the trilogy, as Dark of the Moon
mixes the humor and heart of the first, with the utter carnage of the
second, while jacking up the ante in terms of conflict and suspense.
That being said, it is freakin&#x27; frustrating to watch sometimes.<br /><br />With Dark of the Moon, we follow Sam with a new girlfriend but no job
and a frustration of not advancing far in life despite saving the
world&#x85;.twice. In the meantime, the Autobots and the Decepticons race to
discover the secrets of a spacecraft that had crashed on the moon many
decades ago. This discovery will lead to the most haunting conflicts in
the franchise as well as a multitude of surprises and twists and turns.
Unlike the first two scripts, which didn&#x27;t really pack anything juicy
other than action scenes, Ehren Kruger&#x27;s script actually does a great
job fixing the Megan Fox dilemma while adding a dosage of much-needed
heart with a much more likable cast of characters and less of the
embarrassing stereotypes that we had to suffer through in Revenge of
the Fallen. The stakes are much higher and the film never really drags
along with unnecessary scenes. The final battle did take a while
though.......<br /><br />The special effects have always propelled this franchise during the
dullest of moments, and they shine once again with Dark of the Moon. If
this doesn&#x27;t get at least an Academy Award nomination, I will be
extremely disappointing. Action junkies, you will definitely get your
money&#x27;s worth as a major city becomes a massive battlefield full of
nasty destruction and pure mayhem everywhere. In the meantime the
Transformer fights, while (once again) minimal, deliver in the visual
department. That being said, it was odd to change the blood of the
robots from a dark color in the second to a clear red. Not quite sure
what they were trying to pull off there. That little note can be pushed
aside as we see a gigantic building get torn in half literally and fall
on top of another building.<br /><br />The cast in the third was the strongest, and it&#x27;s mostly because of the
small roles. While Shia LaBeouf actually disappointed a bit, the Megan
Fox replacement (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) didn&#x27;t do half-bad with the
minimal material she was given. In the meantime, check out the talent
in the small roles department: John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, Ken
Jeong, Leonard Nimoy, John Turturro, Patrick Dempsey (okay, so the last
one might be pushing it, but he did well. Honest. Despite being a
really...stupid character). Of course, the parents once again weren&#x27;t
in the movie enough (Kevin Dunn, Julie White) and pretty much disappear
way before the climax.<br /><br />Here is where the ball is dropped: Transformers 3 is a pretty stupid
movie. There is some heart, some soul maybe, but no smarts. Without
spoiling too much, some of our characters (heroes and even villains)
just make some dumbfounded moves and utterly questionable decisions
that defy logic. And then, Michael Bay, once again, falters as a
director. He does indeed have a knack for explosions and military-based
scenes, but the robots fighting each other (yet again) are sometimes
hard to distinguish. And then he does some very questionable things
lake fading the screen to black far too many times (in one instance
three times in a small scene that wasn&#x27;t even necessary). I miss 90s
Michael Bay, when he kept the action close and crisp, but never too
close to a point of getting a headache. He got the carnage and
destruction scenes right, but once the action picks up amongst those
robots, it becomes a frustrating game of Where&#x27;s Waldo.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Transformers: Dark of the Moon is the best of the three
films, but that&#x27;s still not saying too much as the direction is still
shoddy, I still don&#x27;t care about Shia LeBeouf&#x27;s character, there is
plenty of stupidity sprinkled throughout, and it still just doesn&#x27;t
have the quality factor of the better summer blockbusters we&#x27;ve seen
over the decades. While the casting, writing, and special effects
improved, we are still treated to strong potential not being met. The
main villains (and coolest robots) are still idiotic and reduced to
cameos, as Optimus Prime once again does his &#x22;I am going to disappear
for a while and then re-appear later to kick some arse&#x22; routine. If you
are a Transformer fan, you will probably appreciate this much more, as
the transformers (while some reduced to cameos) visually look amazing,
and the chaos they create is incredible on the big screen. But if you
are looking for quality, you may want to peek elsewhere. For some
mindless fun, look no further.<br /><br />And be happy that this is far better than Revenge of the Fallen.
