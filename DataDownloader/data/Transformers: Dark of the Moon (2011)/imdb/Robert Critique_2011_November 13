Take reviews from countless pointless CGI infested movies and stick
them here.<br /><br />This movie neither repulsed me nor engrossed me and to be frank I think
the people harping on about scientific inaccuracies should never have
considered any of the 3 Transformer movies as suitable viewing. There
are so many holes in the plot it looks like Swiss Cheese. So what?<br /><br />I will say this however and I never EVER thought I would: I preferred
Megan Fox. I can&#x27;t believe it myself but they somehow managed to find
someone with even less facial muscles and a screen presence that is
almost ethereal. I never thought it was possible to make a grade &#x22;A&#x22;
genetically &#x22;superior&#x22; human specimen and make them so unimaginably
dull to the point of irritation. That is the only lasting impression
this movie has given me.<br /><br />Not 150 minutes wasted but definitely 150 minutes that could have been
used watching something better.
