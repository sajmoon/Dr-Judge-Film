Taking place a couple years after Revenge of the Fallen, the film sees
Sam Witwicky living in Washington D.C., and completely bored while the
Autobots are off around the world, keeping the human race safe from
harm. The Autobots soon learn about a secret vessel on the dark side of
the moon, containing their former commander, Sentinel Prime. Meanwhile,
the Decepticons are gearing up to release Hell on Earth, by using
mysterious warp pillars to recreate their fallen planet Cybertron,
which would spell the end for all us humans.<br /><br />I&#x27;m one of the few people who actually enjoys, or even likes most of
Michael Bay&#x27;s movies, and the only one I really can&#x27;t stand is Pearl
Harbor. I kind of think of him as Zack Snyder not making COMPLETE crap.
Needless to say, Dark of the Moon is another entry into the films of
his that I actually enjoy.<br /><br />The screenplay is pretty straightforward and uneven, and the acting is
sometimes way over the top, but with Dark of the Moon&#x27;s blend of a
likable enough cast, sporadic humor, and the fact that it fully
embraces the brainlessness most of the time, such a thing isn&#x27;t that
hard to forgive.<br /><br />Besides, what Michael Bay has always lacked in fully developed
characters, he&#x27;s made up for with his grand sense of scale, and the
explosive adrenaline of his action sequences. The visual effects
artistry is sheer perfection, and I&#x27;d also be surprised if I saw a
movie this year with better sound design than this one.<br /><br />Probably the biggest flaw of the film, at least for me, is the climax.
It&#x27;s essentially a series of back to back explosions and robot brawls,
which isn&#x27;t really such a bad thing, but the simple fact is this: 43
minutes is pushing it. BIG TIME! The finale could have been trimmed at
least 11 minutes, and the movie overall at least 20, to move things
along, and make it less exhausting, but I was still able to really
enjoy what I saw.<br /><br />If you&#x27;re just looking for some solid, action entertainment to go along
with that bucket of popcorn, maybe this could be a nice choice. If not,
maybe you&#x27;ll enjoy the soundtrack which includes Linkin Park, Paramore,
and Goo Goo Dolls.<br /><br />Regardless of the flaws that it certainly has, I&#x27;m gonna give it a
solid rating of **1/2 out of ****
