2011_November 2 
It was terrible! I went with my friend this summer, I have no idea why,
but we were so bored! It was way too long, there was no plot, it was
just awful! I&#x27;m a girl, and I know this is a &#x22;dude movie&#x22; (as I call
it), but the girl was in all white, running around in stilettos, and
they kept doing these slow motion things of her, and she looked
perfect! Too perfect! The action was so-so, and I loved the Asian guy.
He was the only person in the entire movie I had any sort of feeling
for at all, and they kill him off in the first hour! This movie was,
what, three hours? It needed to be about two, at the max. Waste of my
six dollars, glad I didn&#x27;t go at night and pay nine.
