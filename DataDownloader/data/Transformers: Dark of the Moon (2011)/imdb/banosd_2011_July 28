The third Transformers movie has some of the best action visuals ever
filmed and were plenty exciting in 2D.<br /><br />During the &#x22;Invasion of Chicago&#x22;, there are many CGI ships flying
around downtown. The alien crafts resemble those in earlier movies this
year like Skyline and Battle Los Angeles. There are spectacular aerial
views of the combat and mayhem. The sweeping panoramic views of Lake
Michigan and the Chicago Skyline with soldiers jumping out of
helicopters and buildings set to a drum pounding score were comparable
to some of the action scenes in the Dark Knight. <br /><br />The story begins with a new interpretation of the first man on the moon
mission and makes an immediate impression. The scope of this film is
immense as there is action on the moon, White House, Lincoln Memorial,
Downtown Chicago and what appears to be a replica of Chernobyl. <br /><br />THE HUMANS (AMERICANS):<br /><br />Sam (Shia LaBeouf) wants to be taken seriously and succeeds by shouting
in our ears most of the time. Maybe he was trying to be heard over the
non-stop music and action. Col. Lennox (Josh Duhamel) shouts a lot as
well. Sam&#x27;s new love interest Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) is
there to be the damsel in distress. Although her accent is out of
place, Director Michael Bay does a fine job showcasing her beauty
utilizing a variety of wardrobes and backdrops. Tyrese Gibson is
featured prominently in the action scenes along with Lester Speight (of
Office Linebacker Terry Tate fame). The soldiers seemed to have a
greater role in the outcome of this film rather than the previous two.<br /><br />There are frequent attempts at comic relief from both the robots and
the humans, most of which are not funny but at least are entertaining.
For the characters that we already know from the first two films, we
get more of the same. Sam&#x27;s parents are less obnoxious this time (Kevin
Dunn, Julie White) as is Seymour Simmons (John Turturro). But many of
the new characters (played by some veteran actors) were there to ham
things up. I don&#x27;t think any of these guys were necessarily bad, as
they succeeded in keeping us occupied until the battles took place. <br /><br />THE ROBOTS:<br /><br />In one corner we have The Decepticons who are tough foes once again,
this time their heavy hitter is a gigantic snake-like robot that rips
through buildings and streets. &#x22;Spock&#x22; does the voice of the powerful
turncoat robot Sentinel Prime whose arm is like a sword and the beat-up
looking Megatron is back to manipulate and scheme.<br /><br />And for the reigning heavyweight champ Autobots, Optimus Prime reprises
his role as the robot Rambo who comes in only for the final stages of
the battles after his mates take their abuse.<br /><br />Overall, this one was a little more entertaining then Revenge of the
Fallen.
