The animated movie from the 80&#x27;s had it right with the lyrics from
&#x22;Touch.&#x22;<br /><br />&#x22;It&#x27;s in the blood, it&#x27;s in the will It&#x27;s in the mighty hands of steel
When you&#x27;re standin&#x27; your ground&#x22;<br /><br />Dark of the Moon was a gnarly ride. The movie picked you up, started up
that first hill, then sent you on the movie roller coaster ride of the
summer.<br /><br />It&#x27;s the best live action movie I&#x27;ve seen in 3D since Avatar. The
action/battle scenes are incredible. For someone who was really opposed
to 3D, Bay really took to the technology.<br /><br />Now, will anyone be getting Oscar nods for their acting...no. But that
doesn&#x27;t mean it wasn&#x27;t a fun movie. There are a few cheesy moments and
lame jokes, but that has been with the series since the chihuahua in
the first movie. (At least we were spared all the sexual innuendo, and
robot anatomy from Revenge of the Fallen.)<br /><br />Rosie Huntinton-Whiteley was more believable and much more likable than
Fox was in the previous two movies. Shia was both hilarious, gripping
at times, and full on action hero. The soldiers were awesome as always.<br /><br />The story was much larger in scope, and better than it&#x27;s predecessors.
There are even a few moments that took me back to the summer of &#x27;86 and
my 7 year old self.<br /><br />If you like huge, epic, sci-fi action, this movie is for you. If you&#x27;re
looking for There Will be Blood, or No Country for Old Men, stay at
home.<br /><br />The score was also fantastic. Jablonsky has really come into his depth
with this one for the franchise. I just wish they&#x27;d release the Score
for purchase already.<br /><br />Dark of the Moon lands squarely in my top 3 favorite movies of 2011&#x27;s
Summer season. Right behind Super 8, and tied with X-Men.
