(MINOR SPOILERS) I know I&#x27;m saying a lot by summarizing it this way,
but I can&#x27;t help but feel right in doing so. Before I review all
aspects of the film, I&#x27;ll talk about the story.<br /><br />The story is being reviewed as convoluted, choppy and all over the
place. And I can admit it can seem so for some audiences, but I think
the film is directed for a target audience. I&#x27;d say Star Trek Trekkers!
If you&#x27;re a hard core Trekker, than this might be the best film ever
created. It sounds bold, but I seriously feel that this is the case. I
might sound corny for saying so, but I acknowledge that. And this is
why I believe it is one of the most important films of all time.<br /><br />In Transformers, and Transformers 2, we saw some simple good vs. evil
battles, great action, and funny scenes. In Transformers 3 Dark of The
Moon, we get a whole lot more. More in plot, and a much more subliminal
tale that blends fiction with historical account. If you believe in The
Secret Space Program, E.T. controlled governments, and UFO&#x27;s, or plain
and simple; aliens amongst us, than this film is the nutshell. I
believe that Transformers 3 and it&#x27;s plot is basically centered around
conspiracy theories that have been running since the 50&#x27;s. This is E.T.
disclosure in fiction form, You will see simulated stock footage of
John F. Kennedy discussing UFO&#x27;s. Only to see real stock footage right
after wards. You will see astronaut Neil Armstrong in a cameo
appearance, only to see a scene of him taking an oath not to discuss
his knowledge of aliens on the moon and on Earth. Why would Neil
Armstrong agree to the role if he didn&#x27;t agree with all of this?! It&#x27;s
absolutely perplexing to me.<br /><br />The movie was darker than the previous 2. Less comedy, but thought Shia
Lebouf was the best in this 3rd installment. He was very good, and as
funny as ever. But yes, the movie lacks emotion as most critics say,
but It doesn&#x27;t matter, it&#x27;s a plot driven film, not a character film.
The CGI is the best I&#x27;ve ever seen, simple as that. It surpasses
Avatar&#x27;s CGI by far, I was absolutely mesmerized by the CGI in this
film, and the previous 2 Transformers films do not compare to this one.
Even the fight scenes were well choreographed, where as in the past 2
films, they seemed blurry and rushed.<br /><br />This is Micheal Bay&#x27;s best film. It&#x27;s his masterpiece, without any
doubt! I just wish the film was rated R, like I said in my review in
the other Transformers film that you can find on here. I think a more
serious tone would have made this less campy and just better.<br /><br />In the end, there is an all to powerful message. All the evil in this
world is due to a spiritually evil Extraterrestrial intelligence that
intervened with our technological progression. And there is also a good
kind of E.T.&#x27;s keeping us safe. Whether through their messengers, or
not.<br /><br />Star Trek fans, be advised, there are many homages here to Spock in
this film, some of his most famous lines are used, and after all, he is
voicing Sentinel Prime, so why not! 9/10 I&#x27;d give it a round 10 if it
wasn&#x27;t for the lack of emotion, and lack of care for the characters.
But like I said, it&#x27;s the plot that is good, not so much a character
driven film.
