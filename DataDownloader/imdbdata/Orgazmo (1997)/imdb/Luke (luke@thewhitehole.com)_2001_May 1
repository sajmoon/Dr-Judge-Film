There are moments in this film that you will annoy your friends for years to
come by repeating them over and over again. It is these extremely funny
parts that hold together this film and make it one of the funniest I have
seen for a long time. To summise, &quot;I don't wanna sound queer or nothin', but
unicorns kick ass!&quot; I might also note that this film will seem all the more
funny after a couple of beers.
