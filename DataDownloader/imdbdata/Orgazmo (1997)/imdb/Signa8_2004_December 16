I have to say, I feel pretty sorry for those who didn't like this
movie. It's not a movie for the mature of mind or soccer moms; but most
of those people would shy away from the title alone. I don't need to
say anything about the story other than &quot;Mormon porn-star.&quot; Everyone
else that posted here has taken care of that for me. One part that I'm
surprised no one I saw mentioned was the scene when Joe Young is
praying to God about the job, and asks for a sign to say this is the
wrong thing to do. As if in response, an earthquake starts (keep in
mind they are in California) causing Joe to pause in his prayer. When
the tremors stop, he continues, saying, &quot;Any sign at all God!&quot; Though
it wasn't exactly a side-splitting moment, I found it funny on SO many
levels. Another HILARIOUS moment is when filming the porno, the
character Orgazmo is... um... attacked by the ugliest and fattest woman
you have ever seen (i guess its supposed to be erotic). If you listen
closely, you can tell that the deep voice of the &quot;monster&quot; is actually
Trey's voice, dubbed over her own. Another shining moment is in one of
the Kung-Fu scenes. The same Asian Kung-Fu-fighting-words are spoken
that were used in &quot;The Spirit of Christmas;&quot; the animated short that
sparked Southpark. All-in-all, this is one of the best movies I have
seen, and anyone who says otherwise may as well as be a Mormon
missionary acting in a porn flick: totally our of their place.
