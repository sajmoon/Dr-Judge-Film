It's still a wonder how Trey Parker and Matt Stone survived after this
mess. Orgazmo is barely a movie, and it's pretty generous to call it a
movie at all. <br /><br />What was really disheartening was the fact that it had a chance at the
beginning after witnessing the cursing grandmother. But then, the film
quickly fell into a dark gloom that didn't make sense and was barely
coherent. I mean, the idea was certainly there, but it just failed to
materialize as the jokes became extremely sparse and uneven. <br /><br />I will say this, Dian Bachar's performance was pretty funny. He
actually put some heart into the project while Parker seemed to phone
in the majority of his lines. Matt Stone also stole the show whenever
his mop-headed face entered the scene. Other than that, this movie gets
old really quick.
