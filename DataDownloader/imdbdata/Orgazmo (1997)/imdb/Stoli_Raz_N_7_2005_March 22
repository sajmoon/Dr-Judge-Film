Obviously this film isn't for everyone. It certainly isn't for all of
those individuals who take themselves way too seriously, and
over-analyze everything. And sure, it doesn't take a whole lot of
brains to appreciate this movie; although it doesn't hurt to have
intelligence as long as you have a sense of humor. Read the other
reviews. Those who didn't enjoy this flick are either so religious that
they shouldn't have watched it in the first place, or are overly
self-important and humorless people. That being said, I really enjoyed
Orgazmo. Parker doesn't just make fun of Mormons, adult entertainment,
and super-heroes: as always, he makes fun of himself and his own movie.
How could he possibly do such a thing? Well, it's easy when you have a
sense of humor. The great Don Rickles once said, &quot;Laugh. Laugh at other
people and laugh at yourself. Believe me, you'll like yourself a lot
more when you can do that.&quot; As for Orgazmo, see it yourself, if you
have a sense of humor. And if you don't, then stay away from it. Or get
really high and watch it. The choice is yours.
