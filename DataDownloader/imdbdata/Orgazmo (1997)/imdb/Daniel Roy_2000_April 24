'Orgazmo' is a sick, vulgar, crude and totally childish comedy: in one word,
brilliant.<br /><br />Parker and Stone deserve credit for taking three pop culture icons (porno,
kung fu and superheroes) and mixing them together in an outrageous fashion.
It comes across as a mix between 'Boogie Nights' and 'Kingpin', and is
totally hilarious, yet surprisingly deep. In particular, Stone's character,
a Mormon, usually belittled endlessly in comedies, comes across as
surprisingly together and not as naive as he sounds.<br /><br />It's definitely sad that a cool and rather original comedy like this one
would be ignored by the public, while formulaic comedies without an ounce of
originality, like 'Dumb and Dumber' or any of Leslie Nelsen's recent movies
should continue to draw good box office numbers.
