Like much of Parker and Stone's material from the South Park franchise,
Orgazmo is insightful, edgy, in questionable taste, and hilarious. The
movie, both written by and starring the South Park duo, pokes fun at
the adult film industry, the Mormon church, and cheesy Hollywood action
film clich&eacute;s. More often than not the jokes land right on target,
although having some familiarity with all three of the subjects will
make the movie funnier for the viewer. The acting is intentionally
terrible to add to the Ed Wood style campy feel of the film, which is
perfect because Parker and Stone can't act to save their lives anyway.
The plot details aren't important; the movie is satire, and if you
think you might like jokes about porno, religion, and 80's era kung-fu
movies then it's worth seeing. The movie got an NC-17 rating here in
the States so hardly anyone has seen it. To bad, because it really is
pretty funny.
