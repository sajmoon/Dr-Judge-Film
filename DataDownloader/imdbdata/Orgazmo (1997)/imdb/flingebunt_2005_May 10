Trey Parker also created South Park....and here endeth the review. Well
seriously if you seen South Park you will know what to expect here.<br /><br />OK, now for the more serious review. Trey Parker is part of a comedic
movement that began in the mid to late 1990s in America. They are not
so much interested in messages but the joke. Nothing is sacred, nor is
anything really reviled, they are just interested in the joke.<br /><br />Orgazmo is less a comedy about the porn industry but a comedy set in
the film industry.<br /><br />Joe Young is a much reviled person on the grounds he is a Morman
Missionary. By accident he enters the porn industry as Tom Hung, aka
Orgasmo, crime fighting porn stay. But can he keep this identity secret
and keep true his beliefs.<br /><br />Actually filmed in 1996 you see that Trey is still developing his style
that doesn't quite hit the mark until the second season of South Park.
Also, working alone (with a little help from his South Park co-creator)
the story and ideas are leaner and more focused, with moral undiluted
(South Park presents Morality as an ongoing debate...it is a Jewish
thing I think).<br /><br />So what is the moral? If you play a role, that role will take you over?
It is more sophisticated than that, it is that you will merge with the
role and end up somewhere in the middle.<br /><br />Not a must see for anyone except South Park fans. However it certainly
is entertaining and funny is a range of different ways.
