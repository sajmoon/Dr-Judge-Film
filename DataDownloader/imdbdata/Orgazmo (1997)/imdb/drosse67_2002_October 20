2002_October 20 

Probably the strangest comedy I've ever seen.  If I had seen this movie when
I was a kid, it would have equaled Kentucky Fried Movie, which this movie
reminded me of in a way.  This movie is really a live-action version of an
episode of &quot;South Park,&quot; except the smart-ass kids are replaced by smart-ass
porn stars.  Like the South Park humor, some of the jokes work in this
movie, and others are just too desperate.  I didn't see what the sushi bar
sub-plot had to do with anything.  And would a porn star and movie get that
kind of exposure? (I mean, Time Magazine??)  I guess that's all part of the
joke.  I hated myself after laughing at some of the scenes in this movie,
but I laughed anyway--especially when Orgazmo shoots his weapon at
unsuspecting bystanders.  I don't know if I'm ready for BASEketball yet, but
this movie wasn't bad for a quick &quot;pick me up&quot; entertainment.
