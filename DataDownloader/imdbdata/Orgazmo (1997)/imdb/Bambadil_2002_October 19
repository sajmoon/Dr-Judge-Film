Orgazmo was a great movie!  Very, very, very funny.  One of the funniest
movies I have ever seen.  It shows how much of a comedic genius Trey
Parker
is.  It is not for younger children though; it has a lot to do with the
porn
industry.  But it's hilarious!  I recommend this movie to anyone who likes
comedies.
