I consider Roger Ebert, of Chicago Sun Times the greatest movie critic
alive. But after reading his critic on this flick I realized he didn't get
its meaning. `Orgazmo' is not about wit, cleverness or anything. It's not
even an attempt at making a good movie. `Orgazmo' is any movie-amateur's
dream. Here it is: a movie that is daring, funny, full of inn-jokes, and
stuff you can use in your day to day life and make friends laugh at it.
Anything better than the Japanese duo that struggles with the pronunciation
of English sentences? We've seen it; we know it's true. This movie has
absolutely everything. Let me tell you what you're in for: a vulgar exposure
of American Society trough Mormons; a sent up of porno flicks (in a scene a
black guy is used as a double for a white guy); Hollywood's lifestyle&#133;I
mean, keep an open mind and you'll enjoy this one. Rate:
4/5
