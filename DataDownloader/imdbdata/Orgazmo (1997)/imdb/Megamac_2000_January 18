I enjoyed &quot;Orgazmo.&quot;  From Trey Parker, the co-creator of South Park, the
film's about a young Mormon who reluctantly stumbles into adult films by
becoming a porn superhero(hence the title). Very hilarious and frank; it
may
be offensive for some viewers, especially those who are very conservative.
If you're a fan of &quot;South Park,&quot; you may enjoy &quot;Orgazmo.&quot;
7/10
