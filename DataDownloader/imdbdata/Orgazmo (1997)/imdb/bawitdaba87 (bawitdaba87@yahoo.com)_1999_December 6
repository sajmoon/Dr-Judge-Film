1999_December 6 

Well, folks, here it is! The spoof of the porn industry that the entire
civilized world has been waiting for with baited breath. Trey Parker has
taken a one sentence plot (Young Mormon gets hoodwinked into making pornos)
and made it into a technically lousy but very funny movie. I saw this with
a
group of friends and we've been repeating lines from it ever since.<br /><br />Everything about Orgazmo is cheesy, but it's intentionally cheesy and it
works. There is some awful performances here, but some of them are so awful
they're funny too. In particular, John Marlo is hilarious as Sancho, who
receives only a small amount of screen time, but actually had us all
laughing with tears streaming down our faces.
If you've got a strong stomach and like to laugh out loud, check this out.
And hey, TREY, where's our sequel???<br /><br />
