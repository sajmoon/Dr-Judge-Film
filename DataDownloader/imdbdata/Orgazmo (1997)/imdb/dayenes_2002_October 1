I have watched this fine piece of of cinematic brilliance over 30 times
and
I'm still not tired of it.  Literally, HILARIOUS, from start to finish,
from
the perfect &quot;porn trak,&quot; G-Fresh, Choda Boy, Dave the lighting guy,
&quot;Sancho,&quot; Lisa, T-Rex, all the porn actors, MAXXX Orbison, and my personal
favorite, A-Cup.
Why hasn't A-Cup been in more movies?  This upsets me.
This is REQUIRED viewing.  Too funny to miss.
Giving you a synopsis of the story would be a waste of
time.
&quot;What's that?  You dirty girl!  I can do that!&quot;
