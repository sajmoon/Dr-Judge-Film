1999_May 7 

The story of a Utah mormon who is discovered by a pornographer during his
door-to-door mission and given a role in a porno as &quot;Orgazmo&quot; the
superhero
who gives orgasms is not that explict. The sex scenes are normal as other
films and there's only karate violence, but a lot of sexuality. I saw the
UNRATED version which is more longer than the NC-17 version (it had not
been
sent through the MPAA for a rating). I had high hopes for this film until
i
saw it...found it to be pretty bad. There surely was a few funny moments
and
actor/writer/director Trey Parker tried his best...he tried.
