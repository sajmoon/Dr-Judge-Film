1998_October 26 

Suprisingly funny account of a Mormon's rise to fame in the porn industry,
even though the film was rated NC-17 there was close to no nudity and not as
much shock value as you would expect from the South Park Boys, but the movie
separates itself from the series, and is still very funny.  Porn stars Julie
Ashton and Ron Jermey are fine in their supporting roles, which proves that
porn stars are really actors and Parker directs himself very well and is
very funny.Also a good satire on Mormon's, and very true depection of what
they are really like.
