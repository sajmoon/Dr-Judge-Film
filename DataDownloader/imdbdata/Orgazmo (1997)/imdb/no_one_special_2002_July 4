Orgazmo was the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. There is a touch of
South Park humor, but it seems a little more cerebral here--that's not to
say any more tasteful. The plot is idiotic and predictable, but there are so
many gags and side-characters (my favorite being Dave The Lighting Guy) that
it doesn't make a difference. Trey also shows that he has at least some
capability as an actor as well as an animator. 9 out of 10
stars.
