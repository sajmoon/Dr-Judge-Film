Parker and Stone, Stone and Parker, these two guys are the lone one
able to offer a deep parody of the American society that transcend
inept moral boundaries and provide healthy laugh.<br /><br />This movie is just what nobody else do in American movies: Fun, cruel,
enjoyable, original, creative, limitless, parody. Mormons, porn,
superheros,... they all get a good treat that is deeply enjoyable and
appeal to what is better in all of us : Freedom, independent thinking
beyond common boundaries, without inflicting the classical American
moral that is all too often the bad point of 95% of American
production.<br /><br />A must-see (as all parker/Stone work, from Hannibal the Cannibal to
South Park, Baseketball and Team America) for everyone with independent
thinking and ability to judge.
