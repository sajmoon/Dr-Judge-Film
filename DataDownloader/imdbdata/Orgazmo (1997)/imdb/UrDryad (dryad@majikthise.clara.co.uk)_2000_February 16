I rented Orgazmo because I liked Cannibal: The Musical, and I was not
disappointed.  Trey Parker is a very, very, very good screenwriter - it
takes talent to write in a way that makes the characters caricatures of
stereotypes, yet they're individuals as well.<br /><br />People who don't like South Park might enjoy this movie quite a bit, as it's
very silly without being verbally crude as one might suspect (visually crude
is something else entirely).  There is rear end nudity, but everything else
is covered up or out of shot, so apart from some very dodgy costumes
(particularly Choda-Boy), there's no need to worry.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie, and heartily recommend it to anyone who  doesn't want
to think too much, is stressed out, and plain old wants a laugh.
