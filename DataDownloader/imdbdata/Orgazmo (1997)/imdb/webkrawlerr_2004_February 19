This is a movie my wife had been telling me about
for the 2 years I have known her.  It is difficult
to find on VHS (unless used) but I found it on a VCD format
brand new from Hong Kong (on E-bay) so I bought it for
her.<br /><br />From the start, the laughs take place.  The movie startes out making fun
of
the door-to-door-spreading-the-word-of-God type people.  Then they knock
on
a porn director's door (house) whilst in the middle of making a porn
movie!<br /><br />Trey Parker, one of the door-to-door clergymen, gets talked
into playing the star of the porn movie, &quot;Orgazmo&quot;, and it takes off from
there.<br /><br />Ron Jeremy does a great job as well as the rest of the
cast.
Even a poorly made movie becomes great if the story is
there...and
believe me, the story IS there!<br /><br />Looks like it could have been released direct-to-video, but
don't
let that fool you.<br /><br />Get it, Watch it, Bust a gut laughing throught it!<br /><br />Enjoy!
