A hilarious film about a really straight laced guy in a really  raunchy
business.  It is a spoof about two opposite ends on the lifestyle spectrum
converging into one outrageous film.  Who else could use the porn industry
to become a righteous, crime fighting super-hero but a Mormon?  Definitely
a
must see for Trey Parker fans.
