Orgazmo is one of those movies that have a stupid and unrealistic
storyline, yet are just so funny you cannot hate them.The movie is from
Trey Parker and Matt Stone(creators of South Park).The movie stars Trey
Parker and Dian Bachar(Cannibal The Musical &amp; BASEketball).Trey Parker
is a young Mormon named Joe who is about to get married to his
fianc&eacute;.One day, after a porn director sends guards out to beat up on
him when he goes door to door preaching, Joe beats both of them up.The
director sees his great martial-arts skills and pays him $20,000 to act
in his porno film called &quot;Orgazmo&quot; about a super-hero who fights crime
and has sex with various women.Joe befriends his on-screen sidekick
Chowda Boy and the two go eat sushi together.Chowda boy is also an
inventor and invents a real life version of Orgazmo&#39;s orgasm ray.The
movie gives an interesting look at the porn industry and shows how
Orgazmo becomes the most popular porn film of all time.Joe tries to
hide this from his fianc&eacute;, but she eventually finds out and wants him
to quit.The director will not let him and kidnaps his fianc&eacute;.So now Joe
and Chowda Boy must save her.They also help a Chinese-wankster keep his
sushi bar.Orgazmo is stupid and unrealistic but is also funny and
entertaining.It&#39;s no South Park or BASEketball but I liked it more than
Team America and Cannibal The Musical.If you are a fan of South Park,
or other stupid comedies, check out Orgazmo.The film is Rated NC-17 but
should be R-rated.
