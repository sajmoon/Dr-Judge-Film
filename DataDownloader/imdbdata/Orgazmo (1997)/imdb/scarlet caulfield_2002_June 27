Trey Parker is a god!  First he brings us Cannibal! The Musical, then this,
and of course South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut and
BASEketball.<br /><br />This time around Trey's parodying the porn industry along with the Mormons. 
I don't think I can even write a full review for this film.  It's just too
funny and there's too much to say.<br /><br />Trey, Matt Stone, and Dian Bachar are just hilarious together, as always,
and of course no porn or even porn parody would be complete without Ron
Jeremy.<br /><br />All I can say is this is a must see for everyone!!!!!!  And the theme song
rules too!
