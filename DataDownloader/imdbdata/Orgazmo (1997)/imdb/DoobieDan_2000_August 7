Trey Parker is probably one of the most under-rated
directors/writers/actors in the movie industry. Some of the scenes in this
movie are pure genius (specificly the scene where Ben explains to Joe why
he
promissed his father he wouldn't ever do a certain style of Kung Fu ever
again.)<br /><br />While some people claim that Trey's jokes are only &quot;potty-humour&quot; or
&quot;dirty&quot;, these people have to realize that this isn't so. For the most
part,
Trey has used american pop-culture for his parodies. The action scenes in
this movie were, for the most part, references to many a television show
from the early 90s. The fight scene near the beginning where Trey uses
Tai-Kuan-Do is definitely a reference to &quot;Power Rangers&quot; and other such
action shows. These parodies sometimes made me cry because I was laughing
so
hard.<br /><br />Right from the opening credits, Trey Parker gets you going with his
parodic voice and his band's great &quot;action-movie-theme&quot; parody of a song
&quot;Now You're a Man, Man&quot;.<br /><br />As a kid who was raised in front of a TV, Trey's brand of humour
completely suits me. And, although most of the humour is very easy to pick
up on, some of it is very subtle. Watching a movie like this is also like
taking a peek inside Trey Parker's life. He employed many of his friends
from university in this film. Regulars from other films (Cannibal:The
Musical and BASEketball) are also very prominent. What would a Trey Parker
film be without Matt Stone and Dian Bachar?<br /><br />I suggest that anyone watch this film, but I'm not positive that every
person will enjoy it. Although there is very little nudity (practically
none!) and only cartoon-type violence, some people may find it offensive.<br /><br />I looked past the MPAA's rating of this film and rented it. What I found
was a jewel. Possibly the funniest movie I've ever seen.
