There's a difference between a joke and the idea of a joke. The idea of
a nun demolition derby (no cars) is much more engaging than any actual
cinematic expression of it. Most funny ideas are like this. On the
other hand, the South Park episode where a kid wants pubes so buys them
is so much funnier in its expression than its idea.<br /><br />The job of a comedian is primarily to understand the difference between
the two. Trey and Matt learned the difference after this movie. Kevin
Smith never learned. This a darned funny idea, but there's nothing
funny about the movie itself. (Excepting a couple slapstick bits by
Toddy Walters, someone who actually seems to have talent. Some sites
other than IMDb have her as an editor on &quot;Thin Red Line&quot;!)<br /><br />Otherwise, the film is structured according to film school guidance:
introspective folding by a film about film-making.<br /><br />Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with
this part of your life.
