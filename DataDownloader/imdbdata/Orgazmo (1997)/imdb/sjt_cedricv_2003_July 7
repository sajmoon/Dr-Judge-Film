It's doing this movie a disservice to compare it to South Park, and
frankly,
it IS funny.  The humour is mainly had at the expense of religion, which
might put some off, but since they're the kind of people that a porno
setting will likely offend anyway, that shouldn't be an issue (I will
grant
that there were some scenes which were obviously meant to be funny, but
were
just plain offensive-- it can't all be gold).  One should note that like
all
good comedy, it has some useful commentary on its own culture's problems.
I
highly recommend it to the mature, which isn't necessarily the same as
&quot;adult&quot;.
