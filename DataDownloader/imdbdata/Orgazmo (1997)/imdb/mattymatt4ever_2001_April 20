&quot;Orgazmo&quot; is not a smart comedy.  It doesn't satirize the porn industry.  It
does make fun of it, in a way, but it does it very loosely.  However, I
laughed.  As stupid as it got at times, I laughed.  I have to admit that
some of the gags were just lame beyond belief and unbelievably cheap.  But
this movie is able to rise slightly above the status of a hit-or-miss
comedy, since there are more hits.  Even if those hits are somewhat
predictable, I couldn't help but at least get a chuckle.  In that scene
where Joe Young (Trey Parker) and his friend, both Jehova's Witnesses, show
up at that old lady's door you pretty much know she's going to curse them
out.  That joke has been used before and it lost its irony.  But watching an
old lady use graphic language--I still had to laugh.  There are some things
you just have to laugh at.<br /><br />I also liked the guy who played G-Fresh, the owner of a sushi/karaoke bar. 
Another moderately cheap gag, but then again you can't but laugh at an
ebonics-talking Asian man.  <br /><br />The NC-17 rating is a little extreme, considering the almost-childish nature
of the film.  People expect something like &quot;Henry and June&quot; or some
erotically-charged foreign film.  The sexual references and explicit
language is rife, but it's nothing we haven't seen before; nothing to lose
sleep over.  And for a film about the porn industry, there's very little
nudity.  And the few nude scenes that we do see are for comic purposes only.
 The same goes with the sex scenes.  <br /><br />&quot;Orgazmo&quot; is very low-brow and mildly forgettable, but it's fun.  It's
simply a guilty pleasure comedy that is no Woody Allen flick, but it
delivers the goods.  Trey Parker has done better.  His work with Matt Stone
on &quot;South Park&quot; is much more memorable, but this was one of their first
feature films, when they were struggling filmmakers.  And it wasn't bad for
a debut effort.    <br /><br />
