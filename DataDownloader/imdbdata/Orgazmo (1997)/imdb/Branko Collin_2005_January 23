This is good, clean, family fun. Orgazmo and his trusty side-kick clean
up Los Angeles for Jesus. Although the movie is strong on morals (it
shows you countless ways to love your fellow man), it never gets high
handed. Even a slightly cynical non-believer could enjoy the jokes,
and, heck, the heavily cynical non-believer will probably enjoy the
sterling performance of Michael Dean Jacobs as Orgazmo's evil opponent,
Maxxx Orbisson.<br /><br />Makers Trey Parker and Matt Stone also put in convincing acting
performances, showing the world that yes, script writers can act. (Are
you a director? I've got this great idea for a movie!) 6/10
