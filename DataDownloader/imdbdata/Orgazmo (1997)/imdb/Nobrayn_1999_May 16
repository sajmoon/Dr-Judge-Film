1999_May 16 

For a spoof of pornos, this movie contained too few laughs and too few
naked
people (aside from men's hairy butts). The best lines come from G Fresh -
the homie Japanese sushi-dude, and Matt Stone's character, Dave the
lighting
guy (who doesn't want to sound like a queer or nothin')... The other
somewhat redeeming quality for this movie is Choda Boy's costume - simply
the BEST superhero costume ever made. Other than a few hilarious moments,
the movie drags on..and on.....and on.
