The most amazing thing about this film is not its wit and intelligent joking
about the porn industry. It's the fact that it cannot be found in the big
chain video stores. This is surprising since the movie got a NC-17 rating
but has not nearly the kind of adult elements &quot;Scary Movie&quot; has (and that
got the R rating somehow). The movie did not feature nearly what I expected
it to have in the way of sex. In fact, the humor is a great balance between
satire, slapstick, and intelligent dialog.<br /><br />Parker and Stone are obviously very creative, and I am not saying that as
some fan of theirs. I don't even watch &quot;South Park&quot;. This movie stands on
its own as a great comedy. If you can find it, rent it and watch it. And use
your brain so you can catch ALL the jokes!
