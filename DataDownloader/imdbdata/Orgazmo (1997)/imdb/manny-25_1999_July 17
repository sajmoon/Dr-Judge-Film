1999_July 17 

The film was unexpectedly funny. The Idea of an LDS Missionary stumbling
onto pornographers is like not unlike the idea of Donnie and Marie taking
the lead in Antony and Cleopatra. Absurd, yes but think of the
possibilities
for the funniest most absurd situations.  I was still chuckling to myself
one hour after I returned the film.
Not to be taken seriously, let go and enjoy
