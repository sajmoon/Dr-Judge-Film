Soon-to-be-married Mormon Joe Young knocks on the door of a porn studio
one day. The guards are ordered to mess him up, but he defends himself
and impresses film director Maxxx Orbison with his amazing martial
arts. After some major persuading and naivety, Young lands the lead
role of an X-rated superhero flick without having to engage in
intercourse, mainly to earn enough money for a perfect wedding. Thanks
to the fresh comedy of writer/director/star Trey Parker and Matt Stone
(who had not yet released their ground-breaking TV show &quot;South Park&quot;),
the film is rescued from being a complete dud of an acting showcase for
actual adult film stars. My favorite scene is the &quot;happy place&quot; montage
Young is forced to find while being violated by an obese, uh, actress
named &quot;T-Rex.&quot; Orgazmo is an unapologetic, tasteless, mind-numbingly
dumb piece of work with many funny bits scattered about - just the
right rehearsal Parker and Stone needed for their opus.
