While there are few &quot;laugh out loud&quot; moments in this movie, you'll
certainly
enjoy it if you're a Trey Parker fan. Matt Stone (who plays a minor role)
is
hilarious in his role as a very strange production assistant who constantly
makes homosexual references but always precedes them with &quot;I hope this
doesn't sound gay, but...&quot;<br /><br />Like South Park humor? Watch this movie. It actually has an entertaining
plot as well.
