Ok, so if you're Mormon I advise you stay away from this film as it makes
so
rather rude comments about the religion. However this is a hilarious film.
It's raunchy, pathetic, and tasteless. But what can you expect from the
creators of South Park? This is a very funny movie. I would recommend it
to
many.
