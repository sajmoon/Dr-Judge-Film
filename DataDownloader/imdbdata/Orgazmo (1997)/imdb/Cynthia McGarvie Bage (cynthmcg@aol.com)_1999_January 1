1999_January 1 

Before Trey Parker became famous for South Park, he wrote, directed and
acted in Orgazmo.  That being said, this movie has not gotten the attention
it deserves.<br /><br />I have worked in adult entertainment before, so this movie is truly funny
while being sex-positive.  Unfortunately, this movie was unfairly rated by
the MPAA with an NC-17 because of language.  There is no full-frontal nudity
and only off-screen sexual activity.  Nonetheless, I heard a few naughty
words unsuitable for children under the age of consent, which varies from
state to state in the U.S.<br /><br />An R would have sufficed, but it's okay for teens to see brutal slayings
while not being able to hear anything like a dirty joke.  Pity.<br /><br />To the movie itself:  it pokes fun at every movie convention, from religious
flicks to Kung-Fu action movies.  Maybe if you are a Latter-Day Saint, you
may be offended, but the gentle joshing of the LDS church is the mildest
jibe in the movie.  The porn industry gets more slams to its tarnished name
than anything else in the movie.  My favorite bit of dialogue is when the
primary characters have a discussion of what is negative about the adult
movie business (exploitation of both sexes).  This is done for comic effect,
and Ron Jeremy is a hoot as Clark.  I also liked the running  joke with Dave
the Lighting Guy (Matt Stone).<br /><br />I give it a high recommendation
