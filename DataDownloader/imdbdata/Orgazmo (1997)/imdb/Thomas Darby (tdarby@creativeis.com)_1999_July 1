1999_July 1 

For starters: Orgazmo is a good move.  Parker and Stone are still getting
used to the feature-length format, and the film has a few rough edges and
slow moments.  In spite of this, however, they've pulled off an original,
funny movie well worth the price of admission.  Be forewarned: if you can't
appreciate intelligent lowbrow humor, don't bother seeing this
movie--you'll
find yourself turned off faster than you can look down your nose.  Parker
and Stone stick to their hallmark style for this entire movie, creating a
delicate synergy of sheer puerility, genuinely sharp wit, and social
commentary.  The sight gags range from standard slapstick to wonderfully
contrived sequences of Goldbergian proportions; the humor stretches from
re-hashed dirty one-liners to dangerously subtle quips you don't catch
until
the third time through the movie.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment of Orgazmo is not what's been put on film, but
rather what's been put on the movie: an NC-17 rating.  The Motion Picture
Association of America really dropped the ball on this one.  The nudity was
fleeting and non-explicit, the language is no worse than a typical PG-13
movie, and the entire treatment of the porn industry is done is a farcical
vein--heavy on innuendo and hyperbole, light on actual adult content.
Despite this, The film was given the dreaded NC-17 by MPAA, placing it as
'worse' than such classics as Basic Instinct, Body of Evidence, and a whole
slew of other easily more objectionable movies.  Whether due to an archaic
set of criteria, reactionary views of what constitutes 'suitable', bad
blood
with Parker and Stone, or some other reason, though, this movie was robbed
of what could have been a great mainstream success, both critically and
financially.  (On a side note, Parker and Stone are getting some degree of
nose-thumbing in with their latest feature-length movie South Park, which
farcically demonstrates the dire consequences of children sneaking into 'R'
rated movies.)
