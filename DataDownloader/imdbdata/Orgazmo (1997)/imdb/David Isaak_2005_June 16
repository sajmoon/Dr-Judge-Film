Parker and Stone are like the two jerks on the playground who tell scat
jokes for the shock value. Parker and Stone's approach to humor is
genuinely thoughtless, heartless and cruel, and I'm a devoted fan of
Matt Groening, Seinfeld, Monty Python, and Looney Tunes - so don't tell
me I don't know how to lighten up and laugh.<br /><br />Everything about this movie is revolting. Parker makes the pornographic
material in the movie as revolting as possible in the spirit of his
misanthropic attitude toward everything and everybody. Parker really
misses the mark with his satires of Mormons too - he lazily spoofs the
superficial television commercial image instead of the real thing.<br /><br />To top it all off, the movie takes so many clich&eacute;d twists and turns you
swear you were watching a movie made by a spoiled ten-year-old with his
own film studio and a very immature, naive attitude toward sexuality,
comedy and life in general. Parker and Stone, unlike the ten year old
however, have no excuse for their sophomoric childishness.
