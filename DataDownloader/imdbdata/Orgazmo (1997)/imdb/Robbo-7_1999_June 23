1999_June 23 

I had no preconceptions renting this, and I must say I laughed most of the
way through. The intro song, &quot;Now You're a Man&quot; is a hoot and the dead-on
riffs (with the expected flops now and then) just keep coming. I've read a
lot of negative reviews here and can only imagine they're from uptight
religious types or people who can't tell the difference between bad and
good
lowbrow comedy. This is truly first-rate!
