This was the second of two live action full-length movies &#x22;South Park&#x22;
creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone made before they started their
long-running adult cartoon series. I saw both of these films for the
first time in 2005, after I had just gotten into SP. The first one,
&#x22;Alferd Packer: The Musical&#x22; (a.k.a. &#x22;Cannibal! The Musical&#x22;) really
disappointed me, but I found that &#x22;Orgazmo&#x22;, while definitely no match
for SP (the show or the 1999 movie), was still pretty good. When I saw
the first of the two last year, I still didn&#x27;t think it was great, but
thought it was much better than I did before. Now that I&#x27;ve also seen
this one again, I can say I was still more impressed than I was when I
saw its predecessor for the first time, but now think it&#x27;s slightly
inferior to Parker and Stone&#x27;s first full-length project.<br /><br />Joe Young is a young Mormon missionary from Utah who is currently
living in L.A., going from door to door and trying to spread the word
of the Book of Mormon. Unfortunately, he doesn&#x27;t seem to have any luck,
never getting any respect. He comes to one house which he doesn&#x27;t
realize is the home of a porn director named Maxxx Orbison, who happens
to be shooting a film inside when Joe comes to his door. The missionary
soon finds himself attacked by men who were sent out to kill him for
interrupting the shoot, but manages to fight them all off. Maxxx is
impressed with Joe&#x27;s fighting skills, and offers him the starring role
in his latest movie, the role of a superhero named Orgazmo! The only
problem is that appearing in a movie like this goes against Joe&#x27;s
beliefs. Still, he reluctantly takes the part so he can get enough
money to marry his fianc&#xE9;e, Lisa, who is still in Utah, in a temple. He
still doesn&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s doing the right thing, and tries to keep the
movie he is doing a secret from Lisa. However, the young Mormon doesn&#x27;t
realize he&#x27;s being used by Maxxx, and when &#x22;Orgazmo&#x22; turns out to be a
hit, he is in for trouble! <br /><br />At the beginning, Joe Young (played by Trey Parker), along with a
fellow Mormon missionary are going from door to door, and this part is
generally amusing, especially when they come to an elderly woman&#x27;s
door, and she swears at them. When I watched the film last night, I was
at least mildly amused for the most part, despite how juvenile much of
it is. Joe Young doing porn, despite his beliefs, leads to some amusing
situations. Other characters add to the humour as well. These include
Dian Bachar&#x27;s character, Ben Chapleski, who plays Orgazmo&#x27;s sidekick,
ChodaBoy, as well as Matt Stone&#x27;s character, Dave the Lighting Guy, and
G-Fresh, the sushi bar owner played by Masao Maki, who played the
Japanese Indian Chief in &#x22;Cannibal! The Musical&#x22;. Not too many, if any,
of this movie&#x27;s gags could go down as classics, but many of them still
made me laugh. Most of them didn&#x27;t really put me off, though some of
them did, such as three lame fart jokes, the &#x22;T-Rex&#x22; scene, and the
closing sequence before the credits. I also didn&#x27;t care much for the
part where Joe and Ben go out with the &#x22;Orgazmorator&#x22; and start
shooting it at people to see what happens. Mind you, what happens later
in the film after they zap a guard dog with it made me laugh, even
though I sort of got the feeling it shouldn&#x27;t have.<br /><br />Despite what some people may assume, this is NOT a porno movie. It is a
very crude comedy (as one would expect from Trey Parker and Matt Stone)
with a lot of vulgar language and sex, but there&#x27;s no full frontal
nudity or anything. It&#x27;s just barely more explicit than, let&#x27;s say, an
Austin Powers movie. However, it could still offend a lot of viewers,
especially religious people, obviously including Mormons. Since it&#x27;s
from the creators of &#x22;South Park&#x22;, this shouldn&#x27;t surprise anybody.
Most of their material is not for those who are easily offended. If
you&#x27;re an adult and are willing to laugh at crude, juvenile, tasteless
humour, &#x22;Orgazmo&#x22; could amuse you, though it could also disappoint you.
Overall, I think this is a reasonably funny, extremely silly romp, and
I&#x27;m not sure if I should rate it 6 or 7. The main factor of my 6/10
rating is probably the ending, which I&#x27;m not going to give away, but I
already pointed out before that it was a low point in the film for me.
Despite its flaws, I can think of how much worse the film would have
been if Tom Green had made it!
