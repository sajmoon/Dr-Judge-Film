You need to have a certain understanding of the word &quot;funny,&quot; to fully
enjoy the jokes in this film; otherwise, you will probably be lame and
not laugh at the DVDA joke. The idea of Joe Young attempting to explain
the history of the Mormons in juxtaposition of a washed up porn star
explaining DVDA is absolutely brilliant. This movie really makes me
wonder if Trey Parker and Matt Stone are out to destroy the good
Mormons' reputation of door to door soul soliciting; haven't the Mormon
people suffered enough? I'm still baffled as to why this movie
warranted an NR-17 rating, there is more nudity available on primetime
cable television. Orgazmo does cast the big names in the porn industry,
but in a tasteful way. They give us a never-before-seen look into the
secret world of porn production.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Don't watch this movie if you're easily offended.
