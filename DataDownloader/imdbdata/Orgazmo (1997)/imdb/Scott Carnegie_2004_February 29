I love South Park and I knew I'd love this movie, but I thought I'd clear
up
a couple of things, being an active Latter-day Saint, aka
Mormon.<br /><br />- it doesn't cost anything to get married in the temple
- missionaries can't call home to their girlfriends whenever they
want
- mormons don't pray to statuettes of Jesus
- missionaries aren't supposed to leave their companions<br /><br />Stupid funny movie, just what I knew it would be.<br /><br />Scott<br /><br />
