2000_July 16 

Having been a prisoner in my own loungeroom while the kids watched many
episodes of `Southpark' before they got tired of it, I was prejudiced
against this prior work from Southpark's creators, the Colorado boys Trey
Parker and Matt Stone, Having now seen it, I think that like `Southpark'
it's all very clever but a bit pointless. (There's a very good review of
this film in the IMDBb `external reviews' section by James Berardinelli if
you want to know more). <br /><br />Matt Stone as Dave the lighting guy who doesn't like to sound like a queer
or nothing is mildly amusing, but Trey Parker, as the Mormon missionary
turned porn film actor, puts on once of the best displays of comic innocence
I've ever seen (he must have used it on the producers to get the money for
this film). It was fun to hear the dulcet tones of Eric Cartman as Orgazmo
swung into action, before, in fact, that most ghastly of the Southpark mob
had appeared in public. It's also fun seeing the real porn actors playing
themselves though why anybody would go to bed with Ron Jeremy (or watch him)
is a total mystery. Yet he has been in an astounding 580 porn films,
according to this database, having started his film career as an extra in
`Jesus Christ Superstar'.<br /><br /> If I were in the porn industry I think I'd feel a bit exploited. Oh, well,
perhaps that justifies `Orgazmo.' At the end of the day, though, this film
is one more example to prove P T Barnum's dictum that nobody ever went broke
underestimating public taste. Given the number of bad movies around, I don't
see the point of talented people making deliberately bad ones, except as a
tax loss. Perhaps that was the plan, ruined by the success of 
`Southpark'!
