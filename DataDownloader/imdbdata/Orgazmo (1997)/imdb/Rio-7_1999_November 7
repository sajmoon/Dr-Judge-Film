1999_November 7 

Sometimes I am sensitive to the subject of religion in movies like this
because I'm Christian but I have to give Trey Parker and the rest of the
crew credit for being funny about Jesus without being degrading.<br /><br />To be perfectly honest, I have never, EVER laughed so hard at a movie in my
life. I am proud to say that Trey Parker is the funniest guy in tv and film
history. The movie is completely stupid, sick, and pathetic. And it was
GREAT. <br /><br />Trey does a great job as Mormon Joe Young. His &quot;partner in South Park
crime&quot;, Matt Stone, also makes some hilarious cameos. The fact that many
real adult film stars appeared in the movie makes it all the more fun to
watch.<br /><br />The only problem I had was the NC-17 rating. But I believe the reason why
this movie was given that rating is so parents wouldn't show it to their
kids. I wouldn't show it to mine either, it's made for a VERY adult
audience.<br /><br />If you love tasteless humor and you don't take it seriously, rent this movie
and kick back. You'll love it. Be sure to be sitting down because you'll be
rolling on the floor laughing.
