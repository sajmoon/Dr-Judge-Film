1998_November 9 

For those of you not in the know &quot;Fluff&quot; is the name of certain people on
the set of porn movies that are there to assure &quot;Maximum Possible
Tumescence&quot; for the male porn stars.<br /><br />This movie is pure fluff.<br /><br />There are outrageous sight gags and lots of sophomoric humour.  I have never
seen so many bare male behinds in any one movie.<br /><br />It is quite cartoonish with lots of South Park-type jokes.  However, it is
NOT a movie that kids should see.<br /><br />All in all this was a very funny movie -- not a classic by any means but
well worth seeing.
