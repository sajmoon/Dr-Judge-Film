Orgazmo is a very funny movie that has South Park style humor mixed with
porno.The acting in this movie makes everything alot funnier,most of the
stuff in this film is original,and the story line is pretty funny.The main
reason why this movie is so damn funny is because the main character is
basically a preacher.The story line is very original,a Godly person gets
caught up in the porno industrie,and he is very reluctant to do the stuff
he
is supposed to do.Orgazmo's sidekick is unbelievably funny.One thing that
people may not like,is that Matt Stone didnt appear much in the
film.Seriously,Orgazmo is an extremely funny movie that delivers crap in
your pants humor,good acting,and original story line.10 out of
10.
