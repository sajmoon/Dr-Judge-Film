This may be one of Parker and Stone's best work to date.  Being a big fan
of
south park, i stumbled on to the movie one night on T.V. It was really
entertaining and most of all funny.  The characters, especially
Dave(stone's
character) Ben/choda boy(bachar's character) are the best.  I haven't seen
the Book of Orgazmo yet, but i have bought the Orgazmo DVD.  I recommend
it
for any south park fan.
