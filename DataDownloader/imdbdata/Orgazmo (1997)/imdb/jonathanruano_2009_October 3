Orgazmo is a truly bad movie about a Mormon who goes into pornography
to raise enough money to build his own temple. Now perhaps this movie
would have worked, if it was a real porno with sex scenes. But
unfortunately, it has no sex scenes whatsoever. On top of that, the
plot is dull and the acting is terrible.<br /><br />It is the sort of film that gives even bad pornographic films a bad
name. So if you are into the sort of thing that the creators of orgazmo
are into, I would take a pass on Orgazmo and rent some other porno
film, like Forbidden Science or Co-ed Confidential. You are your
drinking friends will have a lot of more fun and your evening would not
be ruined by this crap.
