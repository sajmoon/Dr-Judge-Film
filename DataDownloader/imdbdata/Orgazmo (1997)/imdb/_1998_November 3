This film is hilarious. My friend and I saw it with an unruly audience but
all of us were laughing our butts off! The film may not be a masterpiece but
it is a righteous comedy with many, many humorous moments! Trey Parker plays
his part as Joe Young perfectly never once slipping into a caricature but
rather remaining true to the spirit of his character. The supporting cast is
truly funny including the actors who play Choda Boy, Nuetered Man and
Young's girlfriend Lisa. But the real scene stealer here is an
unrecognizable Matt Stone as Dave the lighting guy. His running gag will
split your seams! &quot;Orgazmo&quot; may be silly and it may have some lame patches
here and there but if it doesn't delight you and make you laugh yourself
silly, you need to have your sense of humor checked by a certified
specialist.
