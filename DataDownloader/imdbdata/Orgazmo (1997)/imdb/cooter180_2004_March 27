Trey Parker has done it once again. Orgazmo, the story of young Mormon
missionary, Joe Young, is one of his best movies. If it weren't for this
movie, Trey and Matt may never have had the chance to do South Park. The
movie is funny from beginning to end. It's about a mormon named Joe Young
(Parker) who becomes an unwilling hollywood porn star. Teamed up with his
side kick Choada Boy they fight evil and everything not safe about sex. Me
and my friends were laughing out of our seats. If your a fan of South Park
or any of Trey's movies than I guarentee you will love it. The only thing
you'll be hoping for at the end is a sequel. If you like this I also
suggest, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, Cannibal: the Musical, and
Baseketball.
