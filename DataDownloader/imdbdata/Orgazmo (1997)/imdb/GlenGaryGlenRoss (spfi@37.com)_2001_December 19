Why do film makers insist that pornography is funny? Starring Trey Parker
(who helped give us the once brilliant South Park) attempts to make us laugh
with all of the tired jokes Hollywood has been bashing out since the success
of Animal House. And the insults played for 'laughs' at the Mormon church
are just that, INSULTING.
