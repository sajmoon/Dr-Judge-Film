If you don't like satire, don't watch this movie. But if you are, these
guys know how to make the Brady Bunch intertwined with The Devil and
Miss Jones. The whole show is ridiculous and hilarious. But what do you
expect from the geniuses of South Park. I expect foul language and the
total slam of somebody. Yes, we have DADV and different styles of Kung
Fu and the really bad acting from any porn star set. You know I really
like unicorns and I go hunting for them in my Buick Century Station
Wagon. Gosh, wish I could get my hands on one of those vehicles. This
is one of those films the family should watch as they will probably
laugh their rears off and remember the simple sayings like, &quot;I don't
want to sound gay but...&quot; This movie is not meant for heavy going
church members or the Anti-Porn Society. It was made for all of us
heathuns who need a laugh.
