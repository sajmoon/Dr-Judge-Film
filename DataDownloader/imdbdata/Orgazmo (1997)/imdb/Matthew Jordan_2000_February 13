This movie should provide a bevy of laughs to anyone not so hung up on their
sexuality or religion as to be turned off by some pointed barbs in their
direction.  The real treat here is Robyn Lynne Raab...you'd have to have
lived in Utah to know just how perfectly she nailed the young mormon girl
awaiting her missionary.  This is a genius performance that would have
warranted an Oscar nod in a perfect world (no, I'm not kidding).  The rest
of the movie's characters are delightfully funny as well, from writer and
lead Trey Parker to his South Park pal Matt Stone as an ambiguously sexual
set worker, Micahel Dean Jacobs as Porn King Maxxx Orbison and Orgazmo's
do-gooder sidekick Dian Bachar cast as a modern day unicorn.  If you like
South Park, and can take Parker and Stone's take no prisoners brand of
humor, you're missing out if you've not experienced Orgazmo.
