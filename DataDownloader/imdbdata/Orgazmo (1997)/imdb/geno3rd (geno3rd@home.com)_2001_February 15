Orgazmo is a cheesy off the wall cult classic movie much in the same vein
as
Rocky Horror Picture Show! The movie has a very campy feel to it and if
you
like South Park humor and some great sight gags then it is as movie for
you!
I recommend watching this movie with four or more of your best South Park
friends and sit back and let Trey and Matt take you on a funny ride into
the
LA Porno industry--MORMON Style!
