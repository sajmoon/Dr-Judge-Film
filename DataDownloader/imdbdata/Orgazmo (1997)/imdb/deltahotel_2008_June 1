2008_June 1 
I have not even seen the entire film, but I have seen enough to know
that this is a piece of garbage. I am thoroughly unimpressed by
everything I have seen spew from the minds of Trey Parker and Matt
Stone. If I had my way, they would not be allowed to make films for
everything I have seen from them is pure trash, but this is America and
we have freedom of speech; they have the right to spew this filth into
our media. I personally am offended by their constant mockery of
religion, even though I do disagree with the Mormon faith. And their
sick and disturbing fixation on sex and all things distastefully sexual
make this film inappropriate for anything but private home viewing.
Also, the constant use of profanity, (and I mean constant) shows that
the writers have nothing to say and are either putting it in there for
filler, or insulting your intelligence by thinking that&#39;s all you want
to hear. Either way, it benefits nobody and adds nothing to the story.
It shows bad writing.<br /><br />This is probably going to be one of the few films that I can review
without seeing the whole thing. And that is sad, that I can come up
with enough to write ten lines about a film after seeing only ten
minutes.<br /><br />See my profile for my rating philosophy.
