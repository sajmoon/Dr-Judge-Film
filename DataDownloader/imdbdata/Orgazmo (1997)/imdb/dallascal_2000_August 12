With the opening song &quot;Now you're a man,&quot; Orgazmo delivers an onslaught of
(mostly adult) comedic surprises.  Though the title may thwart some
viewers,
Orgazmo has few sex scenes and even fewer scenes with nudity.  Instead,
sight gags and innuendos enhance the performances of the actors.<br /><br />Most of the characters in this movie have distinct idiosyncrasies (such as
Choda Boy's &quot;Hamster&quot; or G-Fresh's hip-hop lingo) that add to the hilarity
of each scene.  In conclusion, this movie is worth seeing.
