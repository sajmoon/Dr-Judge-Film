Having unfortunately caught BASEketball a month or so ago, I was in no hurry
to see Orgazmo. But someone rented it, so I decided to brave it. Boy, am I
glad I did. While it's nothing masterful, it has enough belly laughs to
warrant a big recommendation from me. There were many scenes where I was
nearly on the floor, and there were relatively few jokes that made me
cringe. I would put it in the &quot;guilty pleasure&quot; pile with movies like Dumb
and Dumber, Billy Madison, and Kingpin. They shouldn't be funny, they
shouldn't even amuse me in the least, but I can't help laughing my butt off.<br /><br />I give Orgazmo a 7/10. I would have given it an 8/10 (Jesus and I know I
laughed hard enough for an 8), but the &quot;dramatic&quot; moments, especially those
concerning John Young's girlfriend, slowed the film to a complete
stop.
