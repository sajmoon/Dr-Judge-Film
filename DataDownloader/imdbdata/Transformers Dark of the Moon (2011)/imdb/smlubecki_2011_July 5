Well here we go again. Another Transformers movie and another round of
critics bashing it harder than a decepticon hitting an autobot picnic.<br /><br />First let me preface things by saying, when do all movies being made
lately have to be compared to The Dark Knight or be reviewed as if its
the next academy award winning film. Whatever happened to just simply
going to the movies and enjoying yourself.<br /><br />Transformers Dark of the Moon fits nicely into the &#x22;go and enjoy
yourself&#x22; variety. ** Potential Spoilers ** I really enjoyed this
installment of the Transformers franchise. The special effects are as
always excellent. As opposed to Revenge of the Fallen there&#x27;s actually
a story to this movie. It appears that the space-race was inspired by a
crashed Autobot shuttle that was fleeing Cybertron during the war. The
US got to it first and learned what they could from it and salvaging
some items that become integral to the story later on. Sam this time
around is out of college and out of work. There&#x27;s some mildly amusing
and awkward interview moments (we&#x27;ve all been there) and he finally
lands a job in a mail-room. This is when the story kicks in. It seems
Megatron and the Decepticons have been working with humans behind the
scenes for a while and now they are looking to terminate some of those
relationships. Sam is confronted with the information about the crashed
Autobot shuttle and NASA cover-up. And he goes to the dismissive head
of national security. The Autobots hear of the news and hear to the
moon to recover Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy) and he tells
why he was fleeing Cybetron. Then the action begins with some excellent
chase scenes on the highway. Great battle sequences and an unexpected
betrayal. Thus resulting in the invasion of the US and some mass
destruction. Parents be warned the Decepticons actually vaporize
innocent by-standers on screen and it may be a bit harsh for little
ones. The new Autobots were enjoyable. Loved the Wreckers and they
provided some great moments on screen. And the final fight between
Megatron and Optimus was very satisfying. This was a great way to end
the current story and leaves things open enough for future movies. It
seems like most of the negative reviews have focused on the fact that
A) They hate Michael Bay. B) Megan Fox isn&#x27;t in it. and C) The story
sucked. Well I for one thought the story was as good as the first
movie. I like the action sequences Bay films and although I find Megan
Fox pleasing to the eyes I really didn&#x27;t miss her at all. I don&#x27;t
expect great acting from these types of movies. It&#x27;s meant to be
escapist fun. A chance to turn off the brain and be entertained for a
few hours. This movie is pure fun and fit the bill nicely. Don&#x27;t listen
to the haters and bad reviews... Go see it.... and have fun
