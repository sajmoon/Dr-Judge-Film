2011_July 6 
Of all the three transformer movies this is BY FAR the best of the
three this plot makes absolute perfect sense and although it broke in
the middle, the 15 minute wait was worth it!!!!!!!( plus we got free
movie passes for next time :-) ) I say SEE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SEE IT
SEE IT SEE IT SEE IT!!!! but make sure u have seen the first two first.
(be careful though the second one is a six out of ten not like the
first one( nine out out of ten) and the third one (ten of ten)) and if
you like this be sure to see the hunger games movie coming out on march
23rd 2011 and make sure you write your own review after you see the
movie Bye!!
