I have to day that Transformers 3 ROCKS! The 6.4 rating is a bit harsh
for something designed to be pure entertainment and, let&#x27;s face it, the
budget of &#x22;only&#x22; $195m grossed a return of &#xA3;1.1bn by November 2011 so I
think the &#x22;ayes&#x22; have it. Take any critically acclaimed film and see
what the return ratio is and then think &#x22;maybe these guys have got
their criteria wrong&#x22; because their industry is still called the
&#x22;entertainment industry&#x22; and not the &#x22;social commentary industry&#x22; or
the &#x22;change the world industry&#x22; (that&#x27;s US politics) or even the &#x22;I&#x27;m
so far up my own backside that I think I can make a film about any old
tripe and call it Art and people will buy it industry&#x22;. I like to be
entertained and THIS film hit the nail on the head.
