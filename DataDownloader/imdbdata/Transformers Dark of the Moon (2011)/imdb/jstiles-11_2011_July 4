This was an awesome movie . If you go into this looking for anything
other than an action packed , transformer movie , you will be
disappointed. I went to see it this weekend and I thought it was the
best of the 3 movies . I agree with most that The Megan Fox stand in
wasn&#x27;t the best , but she is smoking&#x27; hot and not really that bad . She
is better than the chick from twilight...just saying. Shia was great ,
and so was most of the cast . The movie looked and sounded better than
any movie I have ever seen . The music was great as well , although I
must say I do miss the old Linkin Park , not really digging the new U2
like version of Linkin Park . Anyway great awesome ride , if you are a
Transformers fan GO SEE IT! you won&#x27; t be disappointed.
