Hi,<br /><br />I saw the other two, first one was entertaining, second one was awkward
and I just stayed up late to watch this third one......... its long,
its rubbish, its by far the worst one......trust me. <br /><br />I cant believe how bad the scenes were between the new bird (who is hot
and English and cant act) and Sam, so cheesy, so pointless. Its hard to
watch...<br /><br />How do people get away with using such bad scripts, i don&#x27;t get it. the
film costed so much and they couldn&#x27;t even be bothered to make it
understandable, not that i couldn&#x27;t follow it, i just couldn&#x27;t
comprehend it. It goes nowhere, the editing is terrible and i made no
connection at all with any of the characters, the comedy was awful, i
wanted to enjoy it and i&#x27;m open minded to all films, but please don&#x27;t
watch this, i beg you.<br /><br />The only reason i didn&#x27;t give it a 1 is because of the SFX, as usual
the best bits are when the autobots are going off their tits. But the
storyline, acting, stupid soppy scenes and inappropriate credits music
are ridiculous, aggravating and tedious.<br /><br />Imagine a great film, like taxi driver, or the lord of the rings or
whatever you love. That feeling you get after seeing a great film, you
know, when you know you have taken something away forever...its nice
isn&#x27;t it.....................<br /><br />HOWEVER <br /><br />THIS FILM WILL NOT GIVE YOU ANYTHING TO TAKE AWAY APART FROM A DEEP
AGONISING FRUSTRATION, NAUSEA AND A NEED TO WRITE AN ANGRY REVIEW ON
IMDb.<br /><br />Michael Bay, I dislike you for planting this mess on society. I cant
believe that numskulls out there give this film a ten, i mean come on.
6.5 is way way way way too high a rating for this utter rubbish.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t BOTHER
