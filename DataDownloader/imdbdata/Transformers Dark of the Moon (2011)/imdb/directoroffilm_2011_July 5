What you think of this film will depend entirely on what you expect
when you walk in. If you are expecting a detailed script, mesmerizing
acting and deep/thoughtful story then you are going to leave a bit
disappointed.<br /><br />Though if you walk in expecting amazing action sequences, massive
explosions and brilliant visuals then you&#x27;ll leave satisfied. Not
saying that all the acting is bad, Shia LaBeouf plays Sam well again
and also the comedic performance by Ken Jeong brings life to the film.<br /><br />Even though the film is 2 1/2 hours long, time goes by quickly. If you
are looking for a great action packed film to see these holidays I
recommend seeing &#x27;Transformers&#x27;.<br /><br />Also if you&#x27;re going to see one 3D film this is the one. I was lucky
enough to see the film in IMAX which is definitely the best way to see
it as the film really immerses the viewer and you can really feel it,
as the cinema shakes for a large percentage of the film. This is one
film which really benefits from IMAX.<br /><br />Overall: Don&#x27;t go see the film if you want a smart and brilliant story.
Go see it if you want a good time!
