I have always been a fan of the Transformers, the first film was
amazing but The Revenge of the Fallen was a big disappointment so I was
a little hesitant on watching Transformers: Dark of the Moon. I am so
glad that I took the time to watch it since it was full of continuous
action and destruction.<br /><br />The theme of this movie is about good vs. evil, and how good will
always prevail at the end. The film revolves around the Decepticons
trying to take over planet earth, and part of that plan means getting
rid of all of the Autobots. It starts out with videos of the sixties
Apollo landing mission and later the viewers learn that it was all a
big cover up of an alien spaceship crash on the moon. The Decepticons
are able to get started on their plan when they trick Optimus Prime to
go to the moon and bring the missing puzzle pieces they needed back to
earth. <br /><br />Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is of course the main character and his new
girl friend Carly Spencer (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) is his side kick.
I think the only down fall in the whole movie is Rosie and her
character. She is clearly not meant to be an actress and I think that
this film lacks a great female actress to match all the amazing male
roles. I really don&#x27;t see why a movie with such brilliant special
effects would need &#x22;eye candy&#x22;. The other male roles were played by
Josh Duhamel as Lennox, John Turturro as Simmons, Tyrese Gibson as
Epps, and Patrick Dempsey as Dylan just to name a few. <br /><br />The Transformers in this movie are really amazing, their movement is so
real and the angles they are shot from are visually spectacular. They
did a great job shooting them from when they are cars to when they turn
in to the transformers, and the angles make all the difference with
such stunning sequences and the viewers are able to picture how huge
these transformers are really meant to be. Bumblebee is my favorite
transformer and he had a huge part in the first movie but I felt like
he was missing a bit from this movie and it was disappointing not to
see him as much. <br /><br />When this movie first hit theaters in June of 2011 it did come in 3D. I
was not able to watch it in 3D and I&#x27;m usually not a big fan of them
either because films seem so dark once you put the glasses on. However,
I felt this movie was very bright in lighting and because of that fact
I think it would look great in 3D and hopefully I will have the chance
to check it out sometime. <br /><br />At the end all of the Autobots and humans have to work together to save
the planet. Lennox (Josh Duhamel) puts a group together including
Tyrese Gibson (Epps) to go to downtown Chicago and stop the Decepticons
from succeeding. The final battle is a little drawn out and long but
there isn&#x27;t a dull moment in it, there are building falling over, glass
shattering, explosions and all kinds of fun fire. Of course the
Autobots win and Optimus finally kills Megatron.<br /><br />In my opinion it is highly doubtful that this movie will be the last of
Transformers and as long as they are able to put this much action into
a movie they will continue to gain more new fans.
