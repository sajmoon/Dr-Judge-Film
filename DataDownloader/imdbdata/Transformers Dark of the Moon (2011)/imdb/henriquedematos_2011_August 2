Please, do yourself a favor and ignore the so-called critics. I know
many people will hate this review for liking such &#x22;awful abomination to
the 7th art&#x22; even before reading it, but in my opinion it is by far the
best movie from the Transformers trilogy. Before I start my review, let
me say my opinions about the other 2 past Transformers movies:<br /><br />Transformers 1- A good summer blockbuster, with some clich&#xE9; and
annoying stuff (Like the first 30/40 minutes after the attack in Qatar
with Sam trying to hook up Mikaela while nothing else happens) but
still fun and enjoyable overall, I had fun when I first watched it and
I still have fun watching it nowadays.<br /><br />Transformers 2- Okay, in MY PERSONAL OPINION it was better than the
first one. I understand why some people hate it, there were some very
cheesy moments and like a friend of mine said, some scenes were almost
&#x22;glued&#x22; to each other, but in my opinion, even with a
not-so-well.scripted plot, it was a great 2 hours ride, and face it...
Even if you hated the rest of the movie, at least the battle in Egypt
was freaking awesome.<br /><br />But what about this one? In my opinion, it&#x27;s the &#x22;perfect&#x22; Transformers
movie everyone expected. No, I&#x27;m not saying it is the best movie ever,
I know it isn&#x27;t. But it is a great movie anyways. So, let me start by
telling in large capital letters: Unlike the critics say,<br /><br />THIS MOVIE HAS, and I repeat, HAS A PLOT! I am not saying it is a
fantastic plot or anything, but it exists and it&#x27;s there. I know must
people go for &#x22;Meh, it it s a Michael Bay movie, so f*** that, it
hasn&#x27;t got any plot or whatsoever!&#x22; but this movie has a story. And in
my opinion, it is better and more creative than any of the other 2. The
way of how it involves the NASA Space Program, the Autobots and the
Decepticons, and a cool twist that wasn&#x27;t in the trailers and that I
don&#x27;t want to reveal so I don&#x27;t have to tag my review as &#x22;containing
spoilers&#x22;, and in my opinion it is a good plot. Like I said before, not
worth an Oscar or anything, but it sure can&#x27;t be crictized like it if
didn&#x27;t exist.<br /><br />About the effects. Wow. And I mean WOW! The way how the robots interact
with the scenery, of how every single part of their body and every
single little detail is reproduced... It&#x27;s beyond impressive. You just
can&#x27;t tell what&#x27;s CGI and what&#x27;s reality. I can honestly say that, even
although the other 2 past movies had obviously awesome CGI, the way how
they took that technology and implanted it together with the elements
from this movie, is brilliant and by far more impressive than the other
2. The whole battle around Chicago is the best example of how well the
CGI is intregated withing the real footage. Thinking of how all those
scenes were done... It&#x27;s just mind-blowing.<br /><br />Yes, there were still some details I didn&#x27;t like, for example, &#x22;Sam&#x27;s
crusade to get a job&#x22; was boring and there were some characters, like
Mirage (The Ferrari), that could have their personalities better
explored throughout the movie. But it was still a great movie, and by
far a lot better than what the critics say.<br /><br />And like it or not, this movie sure has it&#x27;s spot in the history of
cinema. Sure, far from being as important as Star Wars, Shindler&#x27;s List
or Apocalypse Now, but even if not for it&#x27;s plot, it&#x27;s visual effects
are sure remarkable enough to be remembered and revolutionize cinema.
