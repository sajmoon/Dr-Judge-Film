After the success of revenge of the fallen in terms of money grossing
over the globe, Michael bay n his team returns in Transformers 3 Dark
of the moon. The movie is way much better from revenge in many ways.
Been unlucky not to get the chance to watch it in 3d cause, the only 3d
theatre projector got busted just before the release of the movie.
Totally heartbroken as my other friends enjoyed the movie in 3d. well
let first give you the overall negative &#x26; positive comments of the
movie in my opinion.<br /><br />Negative points <br /><br />Where is Megan fox ? if I would have Michael bay, would have done
anything to get her back in this third installment &#x26; made her role much
better that European chick.<br /><br />Was there a need of the Chinese guy in the movie director bay, I don&#x27;t
think so ! Megatron &#x26; Starscream were total waist in the movie, their
role is not at not convincing as in previous installments.<br /><br />Ratchet share the screen presence for not more than a minute in the
entire movie.<br /><br />The movie would have been better without Epps in my opinion. Bay just
got him the movie to show the link between previous installments .
Movie looses grip in the last 40 minutes due to excess of action &#x26; as
their weren&#x27;t much use of dialogues in the end.<br /><br />What&#x27;s the need of that European chick running around in the battle ? I
could see the glimpse of war of the worlds &#x26; other alien invasion
movies in this film.<br /><br />I personally hate that scene so much the fight between Sam &#x26;
Starscream, it does&#x27;nt make any sense &#x26; very unbelievable.<br /><br />Positive points <br /><br />The movie begins breathless, Autobots ark crashing on the moon &#x26; Apollo
11 sent to moon to investigate. Brilliant move Bay.<br /><br />Good thing that Bay rid of Rc twins, which was pleasure to my eyes &#x26;
ears .<br /><br />Some new robots in Autobots, Que , Dino &#x26; Rackers. I became an instant
fan of Dino, when he first transformers in the Middle East illegal
nuclear site &#x26; his words. Way to go bay.<br /><br />Bumble bee is been upgraded with its design &#x26; now he can even shoot
without getting transformed. Way to go bay.<br /><br />Optimus Prime as usual brilliant in the movie &#x26; carries the movie on
his shoulders specially after getting betrayed by Sentinel Prime. He is
being upgraded to with fly tech.<br /><br />The introduction of new Decepticon Shockwave&#x85;wooooooo my new fav in
Decepticons &#x26; makes me his fan with its first arrival.<br /><br />Laserbeak &#x26; Soundwave looks good on screen too.<br /><br />Sentinel Primes looks perfect as a villain against Optimus prime &#x26; much
more powerful too &#x26; has been given the perfect voice to his role.<br /><br />Shia has improved with his acting skills in this movie, &#x26; proves that
transformers is no where without him.<br /><br />Agent Simmons at its best again in this movie, brings smile on my face
with his introduction in this movie.<br /><br />Mearing role is perfect for this movie, looks more powerful way strict.
She share an important screen presence in the movie.<br /><br />The movie has got some of the best action sequences in the entire
transformers series, my personal favourite, the highway battle&#x85; my gosh
what a chase I literally felt that I am actually inside the movie. 3
Decepticons chasing Sentinel &#x26; bumblebee, sideswipe &#x26; Dino in action.
Ultimate action chase. Dino steals the show in this particular part.
The best part of this chase is the background score, special thanks to
my fav music composer Steve. The music touches my soul deeply every
time I hear it &#x26; it suits the chase perfectly. I actually watch this
particular everyday. The best action sequence in the entire
transformers seriers. Masterpiece bay.<br /><br />Ironhide the tuff autobots does it again in the Mexican stand off &#x26; so
does the sideswipe.<br /><br />Linkin park does it again giving another theme song for this movie, way
soulful.<br /><br />Steve as usual give the best background score once again.<br /><br />This movie in my opinion could have been much better if bay &#x26; Ehren
would have work more harder on the script cause I totally believe this
movie could have been the best in the entire series but as usual its
been ruined in many ways. If this movie would have been directed by
Spielberg it could have been much better. If your planning to make a
4th one then bay please please take all your time work on the script &#x26;
make a good transformers. No doubt about the effects in the movie but
still you got to work on the script &#x26; screenplay. But still the movie
is highly enjoyable in many ways &#x26; I loved it. As a huge transformers
fan I rate it as 9 on the scale of 10 specially that highway chase
which was breathless.The movie has got the best trailer ever i have
ever seen. I am definitely going to buy the 3d bluray.
