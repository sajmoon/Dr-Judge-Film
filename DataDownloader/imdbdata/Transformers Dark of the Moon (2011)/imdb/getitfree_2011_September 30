I was reluctant to view another &#x22;Transformers&#x22; movie since I always
thought those robot cars to be childish - and I was proved right yet
again.<br /><br />The story starts out rather promising - the formerly famous Sam
Witwicky finally realizes that he basically didn&#x27;t contribute anything
(and how could one with all that vastly advanced aliens roaming about)
and has to find a new orientation in life. Too bad he doesn&#x27;t find any.
So he just decides to bust in on the incompetent military leaders and
shows them how it&#x27;s done. Wow. Exactly what you would expect to excite
those teenagers - I mean apart from transforming cars, explosions and
Megan Fox. Not that I wouldn&#x27;t approve of all that. It&#x27;s just that the
whole impression is not convincing, the action scenes are rather boring
and Megan behaves quite erratic.<br /><br />So instead of people spurting blood, deep insights by main characters
and some nice bikini shots we just get two hours full of explosions
where no one dies, people who don&#x27;t have to make any decisions and a
bitchy female lead who behaves like a 15-year old girl. Oh and did I
mention the non-conclusive moral sermons? As if you could get a message
to those youngsters among exploding cars and collapsing buildings...<br /><br />Also the cuts are rather crude, sometimes you feel like you have fast
forwarded too much and then again they crammed so much dialog into one
scene that you get confused.
