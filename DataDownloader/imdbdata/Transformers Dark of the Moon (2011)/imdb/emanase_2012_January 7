I saw some review from other internet source
(eg.http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Dark_of_the_Moon_(film))on the movies ERROR
segment of &#x22;Geographic discontinuities&#x22; Error mention that Mount
Kilimanjaro is seen in the background of many of the scenes in Namibia;
in reality, the mountain is located in Tanzania, more than three
thousand kilometers away. I need to know 1.if its true that one of the
shooting location is Mt.Kilimanjaro which located in Northern of
Tanzania?,In Location mention in IMDb ,Tanzania does not appear ,
2.When that happen? 3.Any credit for the Mountain Kilimanjaro or
Tanzania in the Movie?
