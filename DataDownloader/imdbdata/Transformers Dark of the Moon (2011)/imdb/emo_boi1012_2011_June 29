I was highly disappointed with Revenge of The Fallen and I thought the
script for Dark Of The Moon would be similar to the other films of the
franchise. But surprisingly, it was fresh. Ehren Kruger cleverly used
the Apollo 11 event to create a Decepticon world invasion storyline
with few interesting twists...<br /><br />Although I was amazed with the explosive action and brilliant special
effects used in the film, the film itself lacks a lot of things...<br /><br />It started very well with the whole history of THE ARK and it crashed
throughout the second half of the film. The humour was still silly like
Revenge Of The Fallen. For example, Ken Jeong was appalling and Sam&#x27;s
parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White) tried to be funny and humorous but
failed. Replacing Megan Fox with Rosie Huntington Whiteley wasn&#x27;t much
of a big difference. However, she was certainly better than Fox. There
was pointless scenes around the last half of the film that made it a
really long, boring film. Also, Michael Bay tried hard making the slow
motion action scenes very 3D and realistic which was a bit irritating
and ruins the film. The main antagonists haven&#x27;t performed well enough
to create an epic ending to the franchise In another point of view,
however, this film was fairly enjoyable and the script was written very
well. The soundtrack used was fresh and bends well with the film. There
was some scenes that just blew me away and the CGI special effects
definitely deserves an Oscar nomination. Shia Labeouf, John Turturro,
John Malkovich and Alan Tudyk was enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />Overall, Michael Bay definitely improved this film compared to Revenge
Of The Fallen by creating really amazing CGI effects and a really
interesting script, but it wasn&#x27;t enough to deliver a spectacular
ending to the franchise...
