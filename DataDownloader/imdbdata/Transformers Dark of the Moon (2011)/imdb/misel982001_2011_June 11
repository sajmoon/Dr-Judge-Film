In Transformers III, the battle of humans and Autobots vs the
Decepticons moves into a new level; To begin with, visual effects are
not just state of the art.They are innovative because they are really
superbly designed and directed. There are hardly any faults and they
look like real.Director Michael Bay helps us enter into the agony of
the battlefield with his camera angles and movement. The film&#x27;s
atmosphere is now more dramatic. Many humorous elements of the 2
prequels are not anymore present. The dialogues are mostly desperate
while the action is like a hurricane with a progressing climax that
keeps the audience&#x27;s interest and expectations on a constant knife
edge. The battles can be described as epic. A minus (according to my
opinion)is that the character of Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) is no longer
in the script. Overall, a state of the art action film that will keep
you in the seat from the first till the last minute.
