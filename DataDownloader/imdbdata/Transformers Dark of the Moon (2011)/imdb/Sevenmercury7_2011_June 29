*A review of the IMAX 3D version Say what you will about the &#x22;soulless&#x22;
brand of movie mayhem served up by the likes of Michael Bay, Jerry
Bruckheimer and Roland Emmerich; roll your eyes at the crassness of it
all; but have no doubt: audiences love this stuff. They&#x27;re not being
hoodwinked or manipulated into seeing anything they don&#x27;t want to see.
They, we, I know exactly what I&#x27;m paying my tenner for.<br /><br />On the way out of a screening of Emmerich&#x27;s 2012, someone described the
experience as &#x22;like an apocalyptic roller-coaster.&#x22; And that&#x27;s a pretty
fair summary, if you ask me. These are sensorial thrill-rides,
state-of-the-art theme park attractions as much as they are movies.
Audiences want to be blown out of their seats by the audiovisual
experience. As long as the plot is coherent, the characters are likable
enough for us to care whether they survive or not, there&#x27;s an
occasional laugh throw in to preserve that roller-coaster giddiness,
well, there&#x27;s your formula for this sort of thing. I can imagine select
3D scenes from this third Transformers film playing to sell-out crowds
in any Universal Studios or techno theme park.<br /><br />Dark of the Moon has stupendous scenes of destruction, perhaps even
surpassing the aforementioned 2012. Director Bay&#x27;s robot battles are
epic. The hour-long showdown in a battered Chicago is worth the
admission price alone. Vehicular carnage, military firepower,
transformer face-offs galore--this sequence has it all, including
skyscrapers being crushed and toppled by giant robot snakes. The 3D,
too, is stunning, with a daredevil freefall by Josh Duhamel and his
special ops rangers into a maelstrom of robo-carnage being the
standout. It&#x27;s eye-popping stuff, and just when you think Bay has
peaked, he ups the ante tenfold until your brain can barely process
what he and his filmmaking wizards have wrought with their limitless FX
budget.<br /><br />The series&#x27; throwaway humour is as hit-and-miss as ever, with John
Turturro&#x27;s oddball Agent Simmons and his even weirder German sidekick
(Alan Tudyk) generating the most laughs. Ken Jeong is atrocious in his
brief (but not brief enough) role as a paranoid office worker--probably
the most grating comedy performance since Chris Tucker&#x27;s screechy turn
in The Fifth Element. Other series newcomers include John Malkovich and
Frances McDormand; the former is given nothing to do, while the latter
is good fun in her role as the brassy National Security Chief.<br /><br />Duhamel and Tyrese are solid as ever in their stock gung-ho roles. Shia
Laboeuf goes hysterical once too often but at least his character, Sam
Witwicky, wants to join the action this time around. Brit model Rosie
Huntington-Whitely is sweet as his new girlfriend, Carly, and makes a
decent replacement for the Fox (whom I did miss, I have to say). In the
transformers&#x27; cast, Leonard Nimoy makes a great voice contribution as
the powerful and crucial Sentinel Prime.<br /><br />I&#x27;m going to recommend Transformers: Dark of the Moon 3D to anyone who
enjoyed the first movie, those who love action on a grand scale, or
anyone who wants to see the potential of 3D technology. The SF
prologue, including a nice alternate history reveal during the Apollo
11 EVA, showcases some breathtaking 3D framing and depth design. And
the extended finale in Chicago is the must-see action event of the
summer.<br /><br />It&#x27;s pretty much indefensible as anything but a thrill-ride, but I
thoroughly enjoyed this one, as did the (astonishingly multi-cultural)
audience at my IMAX 3D screening. It runs a bit long at two and a half
hours, but once the Chicago sequence starts, you&#x27;ll be gripped to the
end.
