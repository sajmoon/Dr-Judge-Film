When I saw Transformers back in 2007, my mind was blown away by all the
magnificent robot fighting scenes, and battle sequences b/w the auto
bots and their rivals. Two years ago when I saw revenge of the fallen,
I fell asleep towards the end b/c honestly..........it sucked. When I
saw dark of the moon last week in IMAX 3D it amazed me in so many
different ways. First of all, The 3D was superior to the degree that
some scenes felt uncomfortably realistic. The 3d in DOTM beats any
other 3d film I have seen in the past. I don&#x27;t like to exaggerate, but
it may have been up to the level of avatar 3D-wise. Second of all, SFX
was superb, much better than the past two. My jaw literally dropped
about five times during the intense scenes, especially the ones toward
the end. And finally the robots were so human-like that it was
shocking. Truth to be told, some of the robots have better acting
skills than Shia&#x27;s new love, Rosie-Huntington Whiteley :p. Seriously
though, this is a must see movie for any fan of Action and/or AMAZING
special effects. Don&#x27;t be cheap people pay the extra 5 dollars for the
IMAX 3D, you will NOT regret it.
