The greatest redemption in cinema history, you would think Michael Bay
wouldn&#x27;t give a crap about story or acting but he did.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t know what Michael Bay did but he finally did it, he actually
did it, the whole movie was Incredible, i have never experienced such
an experience.<br /><br />This isn&#x27;t a Spielberg experience or a Nolan experience this now
official a Michael Bay Experience!<br /><br />Do not let anyone spoil this for you, you will see what i mean after
watching it.<br /><br />And if i may also included Ehren Kruger was Born to write a
Transformers movie.<br /><br />You will not believe Michael Bay made this movie! I&#x27;m seeing this until
it doesn&#x27;t show anymore. <br /><br />Michael Bay is finally in the spot in his Career!
