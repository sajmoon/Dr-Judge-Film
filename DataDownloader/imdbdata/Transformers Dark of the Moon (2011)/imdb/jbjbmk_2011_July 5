You honestly can&#x27;t please everyone. Even the best movies have bad
reviews from people who need to get the foot out of their behind. In
other words don&#x27;t listen to the horrible reviews, anyone who rates a
movie at 1 out of 10 honestly hasn&#x27;t seen a decent amount of movies.
It&#x27;s those who would vote at 3 or 4 that truly hated this movie. Those
who vote at 1 are truly incompetent schmucks who should just stay at
home because they will never like any movies. <br /><br />On other notes, this movie was great. The action was there, and the CGI
was flawless. Go see the movie if you like action, otherwise stay at
home this isn&#x27;t for you.
