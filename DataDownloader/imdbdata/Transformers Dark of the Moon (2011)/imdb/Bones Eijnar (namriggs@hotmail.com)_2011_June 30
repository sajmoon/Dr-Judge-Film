Michael Bay&#x27;s TRANSFORMERS franchise has become an enormous commercial
success, and although the second installment received terrible reviews,
it ain&#x27;t gonna avoid people from rushing to see the third one. Now, it
looks and feels exactly the other two films, in reality very little is
changed upon so what we&#x27;re given is a semi-mixed version of the first
two, and that&#x27;s sadly not a good thing. TRANSFORMERS 3 involves some
spectacular CGI effects, and the more time director Bay shares with the
robots not involved, the better the film is, which is kind of
surprising given his experience. Megan Fox has been replaced by a
high-heeled beauty which gives the teenage boys an alternate run for
their money, and Shia LeBeouf in the leading part does a moderately
good job, and as for the rest of the cast, it&#x27;s not very much to say
except that John Malkovich is funny in his scenes. The plot is as
always very confusing and badly told, and the climax is long and noisy,
which one can say is positive, though again - I felt tired at the end,
being the film is very loud and way too long (a huge Michael Bay
issue). It&#x27;s way better than the second one, though not nearly as good
as the first, so what we&#x27;re stuck with is something in between.
