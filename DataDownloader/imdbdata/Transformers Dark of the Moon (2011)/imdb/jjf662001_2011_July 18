So who is with me and giving up on listing to some of these so called
critics who bash our comic book movies? I say if you&#x27;re a fan of the
transformers show or any other comic book film franchise stand up for
it and let your voice be heard. This sci &#x96;fi adventure transformers :
dark side of the moon stars Shia Labeouf, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro,
Tyrese Gibson, Rosie Huntington &#x96;Whiteley, and PatrickDempsey.It&#x27;s
directed by Michael Bay and runs 157 minutes.<br /><br />Going into this film i was hoping it would better then revenge of the
fallen and it went way beyond that this film was a home run. The
Transformers : Dark side of the Moon centers around the autobots
learning about a cybertronian spaceship that crashed landed on the moon
during the war on cybetron between the Autobots and Decepticons, this
space ship holds a secret that could have help the Autobots defeat the
decepticons.The secret is held inside an accent autobot leader Sentinel
prime who crashed on the moon and prompted the space race of 1969
between the USA and Russia.Sam&#x27;s life picks up after transformers 2
living in Washington DC trying to find a job after graduating from
college living with his new girlfriend Carly(Rosie Huntington
&#x96;whitely).Megan fox and victories&#x27; secrets model Sam is one luck guy.<br /><br />This secret brings SAM (ladies man 261) witwicky back into the fold of
the war among the auto bots and decepticons. While working at new job
he meets a co worker jerry Wang (ken jeong) who has inside info to the
spaceship that crashed on the moon and knew Sam had connections to the
auto bots. He gives this information to Sam in an awkward but funny
bathroom scene wrestling around in a bathroom stall. When on the way to
give this info the CIA, which is headed up by Charlotte mearing
(Frances Mcdormand) Sam is attacked by the decepticons at every
turn.Sam realizes after some digging what the plan actually is and all
hell breaks loose. It&#x27;s all starts with his girlfriend Carly being
kidnapped by her slimy boss Dylan (Patrick Dempsey) who happens to be
an allies of the decepticons and helping them get the secret from the
crashed spaceship on the moon.<br /><br />You know regardless of what people think of all the special effects
being used nowadays this is one film where it is necessary to
explaining the story and bring the characters to life. Michael bay did
an outstanding job of bringing this final chapter to life from the
battles between the auto bots vs.decepticons to the attack on the CIA
facility, and the attack on Chicago and everything in between.<br /><br />If you&#x27;re expecting any Oscar worthy performances here you went to the
film and wasted your money. This is a typical sci- fi action adventure
lot of explosions gun fire, buildings collapsing, and aliens. He did a
good job adding some new faces to the franchise; it didn&#x27;t interfere
with telling the story at all. Ken Jeong (the hangover) John Malkovich
(red) added just the right amount of humor as Sam&#x27;s co worker, and
lunatic boss.Frances Mcdormand felt like she was there all along from
the beginning and what can you say about Rosie Huntington &#x96;whiteley she
made me forget about Megan what&#x27;s here name.<br /><br />If this indeed is the final chapter in this wildly successful franchise
you can say it really went out with bang. It didn&#x27;t disappoint one bit
from beginning to end. I give Transformers: Dark side of the Moon 7out
of 10 stars for putting a great product on the big screen.
