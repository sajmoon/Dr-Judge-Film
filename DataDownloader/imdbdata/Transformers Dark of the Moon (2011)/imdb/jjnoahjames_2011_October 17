Dark of the moon is breathtaking. The Transformers look ultra
impressive, and they sound mind blowing. The actors are on fire. Shai
Labouf and the new Rosie Huntington-Whiteley go great together and
their acting is infectious. To start remember to watch this on the
biggest T.V. possible!<br /><br />This is where the 3-part infection starts. On one hand Dark of the Moon
is amazing. On the other it has serious flaws which is EXTREMELY SAD
because this could have been the Star Wars of it&#x27;s generation. What
Star Wars had was flash + all the other great stuff. Dark of the Moon
has flash, but it only has some of the other great stuff.<br /><br />Infection I: Pretentious = why people dislike Michael Bay, you can
really feel his arrogance in the movie. There are some unnecessarily
stupid and glamouresk scenes that just seem fake.<br /><br />Infection II: Confusing, but honestly it does a great job of not losing
you. It&#x27;s not as confusing as Pirates of The Caribbean 2 and 3.<br /><br />Infection III: The Autobots and Megabots are indistinguishable. Not
only do their personalities burn out, but there was one big scene that
me and my wife couldn&#x27;t tell who was good or bad because they all
looked the same (colors). The only AutoBot (that&#x27;s not a leader) that
gets good development and some screen time is Bumble Bee, and I&#x27;m kinda
sick of him.<br /><br />Despite the flaws Dark of The Moon makes up for most of them (except
the last one I mentioned) with some of the most amazing action scenes
I&#x27;ve ever scene, also with a nice tune up of comedy throughout. I&#x27;ll be
watching this again, and on a bigger T.V.
