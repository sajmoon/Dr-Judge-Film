This movie is amazing its got stunning visuals,
graphics,actors,technology,a good twist at the end that nobody expects
(sometimes) but this is all rapid a great conclusion movie it&#x27;s an
awesome movie with great actors and you know what a great voice cast
watch this movie more than once and you won&#x27;t regret W A T C H A G Ain
It&#x27;s really good I think it&#x27;s Michael bays best and I&#x27;m sick of people
saying how they hate his movies so much If you hate Michael bay so dang
much why do you still buy his movies or goto see them so you can
complain or what?? Seriously and you guys trying to say this is how you
should do it Im pretty sure he&#x27;s not looking for kindergarten movie
makers he&#x27;s obviously doing something right by making awesome movies
and getting paid millions of bucks to do it quit complaining and watch
and enjoy
