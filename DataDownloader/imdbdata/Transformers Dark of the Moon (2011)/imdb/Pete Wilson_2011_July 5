We came out of the cinema feeling that we really enjoyed something. It
was a long movie, but after spending a long time there the whole real
climatic ending happened just too quick. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley
should stick to modelling, it will help for her botox injections
anyway, she was really flat and lifeless. I have seen a few reviews say
that she brought a bit of English class, yes, like &#x22;fish and chips&#x22;
brings English class. There were so many holes in the movie and I agree
with many other reviews that it seemed like many many hours were
filmed, but they did not necessarily pick the best two and a half hours
for the finished version. Still the CGI was the best I have ever seen
and we still enjoyed the movie and were happy to part with our hard
earned money for a ticket, well it filled the afternoon.
