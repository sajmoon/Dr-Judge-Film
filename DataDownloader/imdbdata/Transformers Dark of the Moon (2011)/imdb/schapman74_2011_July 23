The first thing I did after watching Dark of the Moon for the first
time was vote it 10 out of 10 here on IMDb. I&#x27;m a sucker for special
effects, and as a kid, grew up on the Transformers G1 cartoons.<br /><br />I&#x27;ve since watched it twice more however, and feel the need to revise
my score from 10 to 8.<br /><br />I&#x27;m sorry, guys, it&#x27;s a good movie, very good in fact... but I just
don&#x27;t think I can call it a great one. It may be a step up from Revenge
of the Fallen, but only in the sense that the adolescent humour has
been cut to a minimum this time around. Outside of that, the formula is
much the same. Plot holes, moments of tedium, funny parts that don&#x27;t
really work. It&#x27;s all as you&#x27;d expect.<br /><br />I do like Michael Bay, and for action fans (such as myself) he does not
disappoint, but there may be times where you&#x27;ll wish for a little more
substance to it all.
