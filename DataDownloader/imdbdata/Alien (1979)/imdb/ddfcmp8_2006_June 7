Now THIS is a horror movie, this is a Sci-Fi, this is a total action
film with completely terrifying instances and unnerving happenings that
plague one&#39;s thought for days, months, and even years before ever
seeing it again. What else is there to say? I was so scared when
viewing this film for the first time, and I screamed the whole way
through it. The art design is so beautiful, and dark, but not dark as
in black, it is dark toned, with all light colors such as yellow and
green, casting a shadow over what we know as space. Something else that
this film has, is the unpredictability of the unknown. I was shaky
about it all with every moment, resulting in my screams. They weren&#39;t
kidding when they said this was the scariest film ever, it is, but some
people might have to see it to believe it.
