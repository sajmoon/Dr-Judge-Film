I&#39;ve seen and collected thousands of movies over the years, and ALIEN
has withstood an ongoing test of time as staying my all-time favorite.
I&#39;m one of those guys who&#39;ll watch good movies over and over again,
until I remember and can recite it word for word from the beginning
dialog: &quot;I am cold.&quot;...&quot;Still with us Brett?&quot;...&quot;I feel
dead&quot;...&quot;Anybody ever tell you you LOOK dead?&quot;... I kid you not.<br /><br />I was 15 when I first saw this, on its opening weekend in Winnipeg,
Canada, at the newly renovated Capitol Theatre. I went by myself, and
to be honest I only saw two thirds of the film - my eyes were closed
behind my hands for the other third. I was 15! I walked out of that
theater knowing I had experienced a new threshold of fear. I didn&#39;t
know movies could BE that scary... and I&#39;ve been a horror fan ever
since, and have seen a LOT of VERY scary movies... but nothing ever
came close to experiencing the kind of frights I got that Saturday
afternoon in the Capitol Theatre in 1979.<br /><br />So it&#39;s nice that the FOX marketing department agreed, in calling this
&quot;the scariest movie of all time&quot;, in the trailer for the Director&#39;s
Cut. Now if they&#39;d kindly bring on the Blu-Ray collector&#39;s set...<br /><br />This isn&#39;t just a movie, it&#39;s an event. My all-time favorite flick: a
10. And Jones, my cat, agrees.<br /><br />&quot;This is Ripley ........ signing off ... come on, cat.&quot;
