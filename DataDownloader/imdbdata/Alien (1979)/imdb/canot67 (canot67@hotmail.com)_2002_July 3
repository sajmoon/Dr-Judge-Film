The best and most frightening from parts one to three.The story is of a
space crew who land on a planet,one of the crew gets infected and brings an
alien back on to the ship.One by one the crew are all getting bumped off and
Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) seems to be the only one who can do anything about
it.The alien is loose round the ship and the whole crews lives are in
jeopoardy.<br /><br />Alien is a gory and very decent film,Ridley Scott must have made this his
most accomplished work.I loved it,but I hate space movies but I'll reccomend
it to any science fiction saga fan.If you havn't seen it already,watch it
now and make sure you sit through it.I liked it,it might start off slow but
once it kicks in it's brilliant.I rate 5/5.
