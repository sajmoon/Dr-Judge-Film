A simple horror story in space that sent screams though the audiences when
in was introduced in the 70's and continues to shock and terrify to this
day.  A fantastic acting achievement by all the players as a crew who must
contend with an alien that is accidentally brought on board their space
ship.  This heart-pounding masterpiece will have you trying to hide your
body in your chair as the crew members first try to hunt down and then try
to escape from the most terrifying creature ever conceived for the cinema.
The outstanding production design, lighting effects and score only  add to
the suspense and horror.  See it in the dark alone if you want to experience
raw fear.
