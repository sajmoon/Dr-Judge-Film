Has this become an all-star cast because the movie is brilliant or is the
movie so good because the actors are great?  I think both.  Seven (plus a
hairy quadruped) tour-de-force performances make it a convincing space-opera
as well as a fantastic character study.  I particularly like the interaction
between Yaphet Kotto (Midnight Run, 1988) and Harry Dean Stanton (Paris
Texas, 1984) as opportunistic engineers.  I saw this film every year in the
past 15 years, and that will definitely continue for decades.  Since that
first time I tend to compare every SF and every horror movie with this one,
but just recently I realized that it's an unfair race against this
horror-milestone.  Ridley Scott builds up the pace towards the end and
doesn't spill his guts (at once) so you aren't able to take your eyes off
the screen. <br /><br />This has the most intellectual plot (and coolest plot-twists) of all four
alien-films: one of the key elements (why do they wake up in the first
place?) of the film is the moral dilemma faced by commercial corporations
anywhere to sacrificing employees in order to make more money or to make
less profits in order to serve humanity.  Strangely enough, the two SF
masterpieces Ridley Scott (Blade Runner) made are also his only two
intellectual achievements.<br /><br />Here's one of the greatest movie scores of all time by Jerry Goldsmith
(the Omen, Chinatown, L.A. Confidential), because it's subtle and instantly
recognizable.  As is the art direction, which was not only flawlessly
executed here by Les Dilley and Roger Christian, but could also not be
surpassed by any SF-horror without computer animations until now, and by
which this genre stands or falls.  No need to mention the concept artists. 
Derek Vanlint (cinematography) also puts his stamp upon the film very
carefully.  The nerve-wrecking hand-held scenes are also used to make the
all-time scariest theatrical trailer you've ever seen.  I hope there'll be
no computer-animations in part five, for they could not compete with this
art and are probably more expensive too.<br /><br />Beware of Alien-wannabees like 'Pitch Black' and 'Leviathan' (entertaining
though).  If you liked this you should not miss Aliens, which is more of an
adrenalized war-movie but does NOT disappoint.<br /><br />Why o why can't we vote 11 :(
