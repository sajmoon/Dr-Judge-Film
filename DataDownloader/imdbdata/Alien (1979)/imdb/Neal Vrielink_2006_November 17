Alien is unconventional, strong, dark and mysterious. Never have I
watched a movie with so much tension. Ridley did a very nice job on
keeping the tension up all the way through the movie and gives us and
amazing ending to it.Even the cast is excellent in every meaning of the
word.<br /><br />Alien is one of the only sci-fi movies from the 70&#39;s that still stands
out today. The eye for detail is so magnificent, I can&#39;t believe it he
could get it done to still make it believable. All those prices it got;
nothing could show how brilliant this movie is.<br /><br />I just wrote this after I watched the movie again today. I must have
seen it about 15 times now. It never bores.
