the aliens franchise is a good example of the fact that the first in a
series can virtually never be undone.one reason for this i believe is that
the success of 'alien' was largely due to the fact that knowledge of the
alien was limited and we never did see much of it.this created great
tension
and suspense because we never knew it's capabilities or where it would
reappear.sequels lost this advantage and relied on a higher body and alien
count.this is also the reason why 'halloween' is also by far the best in
the
series.
