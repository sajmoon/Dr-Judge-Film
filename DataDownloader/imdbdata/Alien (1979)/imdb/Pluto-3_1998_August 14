1998_August 14 

The beginning of one of the greatest series of all time. This film will
 always remain a classic. It's scary, influential and insanely entertaining.
 Not just that but Ridley Scott actually has a great sense of style and mood
 and he plays with that a lot, to make us shiver. There's also an
 interesting mystery surrounding the Alien which we know practically nothing
 about. Sigourney Weaver is just as powerful as usual and really brings
 strength to the film; they make one. Last but not least, the musical score.
 Wow! It's fantastic. I think the Alien series is known for that aspect as
 well. Let's hope they'll continue the series and dang we need it all on DVD
!
