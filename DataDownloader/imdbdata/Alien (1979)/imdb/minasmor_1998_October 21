1998_October 21 

Alien is a splendid work, bristling, however, with unexplained
pre-histories. This has enabled the film to survive nearly 20 years of
friendly [and unfriendly] comment, but it has also served to whet the
considerable appetites of its devotees. The origin of the monster was [and
has never been] not explained and its eerie and compelling life cycle has
eluded definitive analysis. The creature in this film was so appallingly
frightening, particularly in its &quot;chest burster&quot; and &quot;adult&quot; incarnations,
that subsequent titles have been robbed of the carnivorous manifestations of
this exquisite being. The character ensemble, with their informal chatter
and their humanly territorial imperatives, gave the human victims an
authenticity in the face of almost insuperable danger that the normal
&quot;creature feature&quot; or &quot;slasher&quot; would almost certainly lack. Perhaps the
film's greatness lies in the fact that the dark pools of suggestion, with
their limitless depths, conveyed a gripping horror that no subsequent
viewing of it [or how many] can allay.
