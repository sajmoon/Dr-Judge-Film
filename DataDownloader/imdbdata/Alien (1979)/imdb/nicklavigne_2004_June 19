&quot;In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream!&quot; This was the famous title from
the 1979 horror/sci-fi thriller, Alien. The movie was directed by
Ridley Scott, who had only directed one picture, The Duellists in 1977.
Alien tells the story of a spacecraft called &quot;The Nostromo&quot; who
receives an anonymous message from a unknown planet. The crew is sent
there against their will on the company's orders. After landing on
LV-426, three members of the crew investigates the location of this
message and finds a abandoned spaceship. They enter this weird
spaceship, only to discover a sea of eggs. One of the eggs opens and a
weird creature jumps out of it and sticks itself to the face of one of
the crew member. The creature known as &quot;The Facehugger&quot; holds on to his
face for a while and then gets off and leaves the man who seems to be
alright. While having diner, a creature suddenly burst out of his chest
and escapes on the ship. The rest of the crew must then prepare for a
battle with a hideous creature from outer space who doesn't seem to be
too nice...Alien is truly one of the greatest horror movies of all-time
and its director really did an extraordinary work. The movie also
launched the career of Sigourney Weaver, who plays Lt.Ripley, the
heroin of the story. Although, James Cameron directed an impressive
sequel called Aliens, the original is the masterpiece in this saga. I
give Alien 9.0/10 for being a very scary movie.
