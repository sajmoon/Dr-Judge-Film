Somewhere in Space -2000++. A mining spacecraft is asked to stop by on
a planet which was emitting life signals. The exploration of an alien
craft found there reveals strange eggs, from one of which bursts a
creature that sticks on one human's face then spawns through his body.
The creature fast grows into an enormous monster that kills all on
board except one. Typical horror scenario, with such an large number of
impossibilities and stupidities that it can easily turn to comical
(when Waever leaves her gun behind to go and look for her cat, for
example). However, the creature is so incredible that it nearly makes
up for all the film's weaknesses.
