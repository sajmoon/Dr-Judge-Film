Can't believe how popular this film is. This is just because alien2 made
megabucks. There is no story, and the acting is pretty bad. The only good
bit is the bit when the monster jumps out of the guy. And that bit isn't
that good either. This 'spawned' a load sequels, which are all just as
terrible. 2/10
