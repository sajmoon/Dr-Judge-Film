Now this is how a horror/monster movies should be done, all the new cgi
filled rubbish that graces our screens these days are pale imitations
of what is a movie of pure mystery, depth, tension, haunting imagery,
horrifying score, incredible acting and a movie that is paced to
perfection.<br /><br />The whole feel of the movie is unmatched and leaves you with a cold
sense of foreboding but at the same time has you transfixed at the pure
mystery of the creature that is before your eyes.<br /><br />The movies really is a cinematic masterpiece from start to finish.
Starting with the opening credits the pace is slow but because of the
masterful score by Jerry Goldsmith this only heightens the inevitable
terror which is about to unfold.<br /><br />It&#x27;s incredible what has sadly happened to the Alien saga when you look
back and see that this movies attention to detail from the
claustrophobic set designs, a movie score which is unequalled in my
opinion, brilliant acting by the whole cast and the most disturbing
alien creature design in cinematic history. The creatures mystery has
been somewhat destroyed by the Hollywood mess that is Alien vs
Predator!<br /><br />There have been many who tried to recreate the horror of Alien and have
failed miserably. James Cameron did a fantastic job in creating the
sequel Aliens because he knew not to try and imitate the unique
atmosphere, tension and isolation created by Ridley Scott&#x27;s original
and produced another masterpiece in its own right.<br /><br />Alien works because of its simplicity, it&#x27;s a haunted house movie in
space but the whole concept is so original and horrifying that this is
the key to the movies and saga success!
