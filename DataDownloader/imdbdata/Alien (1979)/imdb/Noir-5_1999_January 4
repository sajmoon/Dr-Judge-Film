1999_January 4 

For me, what makes this film tower above the others in the series, is
directly attributable to Ridley Scott's style elements. The cold washed-out
'laboratory'-like colour of the film creates a suitably &quot;cruel&quot; atmosphere
(with occasional colourful shots of deep space nebulae - Ridley you're a
crazy man). The giddy scale of the industrial hardware (the Nostromo -
especially during the self-destruct sequence and the Alien Ship of course)
All functional - nothing glamorous, served by such a tiny skeleton crew.<br /><br />The chilling flatness of Hanson's symphony (interspersed by silence and low
howling winds), perfect for conveying the isolation of space (very
reminiscent of Bartok's music used in &quot;The Shining&quot;). The top-drawer acting,
teased from a well established cast, playing believable future blue-collar
workers. They use natural dialogue and exhibit a genuinely uncomfortable
disregard for each other. Particularly in the scene where they think they're
home and in high spirits, only to later find they are 9 months out and
looking for someone to blame. This tension is used to excellent effect when
the killing starts and their need for each others' help and support, from
such a grave threat, causes them to re-find an unfamiliar part of their
humanity. They begin to care about each other and so does the viewing
public. Their vulnerability thaws through their cold, self-interested
hearts. Something which does not come easily to a crew used to such
industrial automation and control.<br /><br />The crew are a group you can warm to. Despite coming from an unfamiliar
time, they are still plagued by the same greed and petty motives that exist
today (and always have done). Particularly Ash and the plot to bring back an
Alien for the company lab (at the expense of everyone else), but also to a
lesser extent: Parker and Brett and their constant wheedling about
bonuses.<br /><br />Perhaps the single most crucial aspect, is that the Alien is perceived as
cunning, ruthless and very difficult to kill. A SINGLE alien mind, not a
couple of hundred being bagged like pheasants at a shoot (see Aliens). That
and Ridley Scott's &quot;Less is more&quot; philosophy where glimpses of the kills,
let the imagination fill in the more unsavoury parts. Like the scene where
the Alien's inner set of teeth penetrate some unfortunate's face &#150; the
cutaway followed by the sound of 'cracking flesh and bone', forces your
unprepared senses to imagine the grisly results.<br /><br />As for the other movies in the series &#150; `Aliens' - some great special
effects (especially the fork-lift-bots), but the dialogue was miserable. It
was all gum chewing idiocy, high-fives while we smoke another Alien's ass.
 From the Duke of no-class: James Cameron (Think: the last ten minutes of
&quot;The Abyss&quot;). A TV Movie with a Hollywood budget. Special mention should be
made of Bill Paxton as the bombastic Bill Paxton (again) and Michael Biehn
as the aloof (self-styled) natural successor to Clint Eastwood, doing `that
Terminator character' (again). Reiser however, was out of his depth against
these two heavyweights, exemplified by his switch to TV and shallower
waters, with roles such as `one of the dads' in `My two dads'.<br /><br />'Alien 3' was a return to the original's values, in look and feel, but we'd
moved on by then, and well...? More action would have helped. The pendulum
swung back too far the other way. The acting was thankfully
re-instated.
'Alien Resurrection' gets closest through its re-invention of Ripley. I for
one was getting weak with boredom at the sight of her quivering lip and
perspiring forehead, whilst she ran through dry-ice filled dark corridors,
with nothing but the ubiquitous flame-thrower for company. We've been there.
Done that.
It was far more interesting to see her detached and unafraid for a change.
The dialogue comes across as French (a lot like Luc Besson's dialogue ) in
origin for it's quirky surreal note, which doesn't sit well with a lot of
viewers, but I enjoyed Jeunet's style-imprint (especially the risqu&eacute; erotic
shot of Ripley, blissed out, out in an orgy of shiny alien
bodies).
So in summary I'm a fan of Alien, Ridley Scott and originality. There were
some notable follow up films that entertained, but only Alien, truly
deserves classic status.<br /><br />
