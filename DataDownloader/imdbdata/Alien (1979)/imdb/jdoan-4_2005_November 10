I can watch a Ridley Scott movie just for the visuals. Nearly every one
of his films look stunning. This is one of his better ones. I like the
fact that this is ultimately a simple ghost story. There is nothing
extremely over the top here. I like the fact that the characters a
blue-collar people. They don't do anything any average person would do.
They don't suddenly become superheroes. They remain simply men, and
women, being hunted by a terrifying beast. Did I mention the look of
the film? So many filmmakers have tried to imitate the industrial look
of this film, but they have failed. I did not like James Cameron's
&quot;Aliens&quot;. I thought that movie was so many things this film wasn't.
This is one of my favorite sci-fi films.
