The motion picture that was the primer in setting off the explosion of
popularity and influence in the horror genre was, hands down, Alfred
Hitchcock&#x27;s &#x22;Psycho.&#x22; Down the road, with rip-off after rip-off forming
a chain, the horror and science-fiction genres&#x97;now a popular
combo&#x97;seemed to dwindle in effectiveness. That&#x27;s when Ridley Scott&#x27;s
visionary masterpiece &#x22;Alien&#x22; reinforced it.<br /><br />The reason why &#x22;Alien&#x22; worked so well and why it still works today is
not because the slimy insect-like creature can jump out and scare you
or because the film&#x27;s gruesome scenes that twist your stomach into a
knot, but because it&#x27;s art. It&#x27;s a bittersweet work of art. Bitter
because first viewing will leave you feeling really harrowed. Sweet
because it&#x27;s absolutely absorbing storytelling. &#x22;Alien&#x22; is a
first-class example of film-making that goes beyond special effects and
set design to create horror.<br /><br />The premise is both simple and promising. Simple ideas are oftentimes
the best ones. In an unspecified time in the future, a cargo ship
transporting mineral oil is drawn off-course by an S.O.S. signal on a
remote, uninhabited planetoid. The crew investigates and unwillingly
brings back onboard with them a parasitic organism that begins to grow
and change and before long, escapes and starts to pick the crew off one
by one.<br /><br />&#x22;Alien&#x22; is not only a great movie to experience, but a great one to
look at. The whole film from start to finish is eye candy. The
art-direction and special effects are absolutely fantastic even by
today&#x27;s standards. The cinematography is very much like outer space
itself&#x97;dark in most spaces, but with bold embodiments of light and
contrast spaced throughout the misc en scene. The spaceship travelling
through the endlessness of the universe reminds us of similar shots
from &#x22;2001: A Space Odyssey&#x22;, a film this movie obviously is
referencing visually. The alien, depending on its metamorphic stage is
portrayed using animatronics or a man in a suit and although these
effects can be outdone visually by a computer now, they cannot be
outdone in terms of impact, for when the creature is in the same shot
with the actors, the fear is genuine, because it&#x27;s not something
painted on the screen. It&#x27;s really there.<br /><br />Something that the makers of the travesty &#x22;AVPR: Aliens vs. Predator:
Requiem&#x22; should have realized when they were making the branch-off to
this film was that a good horror movie goes beyond blood and gore and
off-putting images. &#x22;Alien&#x22; does boast really terrifying iconic horror
images, but to a certain extent, that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s about. It&#x27;s about
memorable characters such as Sigourney Weaver&#x27;s career-launching
portrayal of Ripley, special effects used a service to the motion
picture entire, and the cemented lesson to any audience member that
film-making is in essence, storytelling and it should be done well.<br /><br />I grew up knowing Ridley Scott&#x27;s director&#x27;s cut of this film, in which
he sliced out a few moments of the 1979 theatrical release and
instilled some new footage that was before left on the cutting room
shelves. Recently I saw the original theatrical version. Comparing the
two, the director&#x27;s cut is slightly better, but the theatrical version
is sheer magnificence on its own. In either version, &#x22;Alien&#x22; and its
first sequel, &#x22;Aliens&#x22;, are first-class examples of brilliant
film-making. It is harrowing, it is disgusting, it is gut-wrenching,
but it surprisingly enough enthralls us as its puts us in a cold sweat.
It takes genius to do that. Hitchcock did it with &#x22;Psycho.&#x22; Ridley
Scott did it with &#x22;Alien.&#x22; Of these two movies, which do I prefer
personally? Please don&#x27;t ask. I couldn&#x27;t possibly pick one over the
other.
