There aren't that may films made in the seventies that I actually like,
but this is probably one of the best. This is a sci-fi thriller with
some memorable moments.<br /><br />Director Ridley Scott is already showing us how spooky space can be
just from the opening cast list. Indeed no-one can here you scream, and
this silent filming method prepares us for many of our characters to
(spoiler) be killed by the deadly Alien, leaving Ripley on her own...<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver plays the character 'Ripley' in this film, who is part
of a group of crew members aboard a mining spaceship. The space ship
interior looks great, and director Scott keeps the corridors dark to
build up tension. After receiving an SOS call, the crew of the space
ship land on a strange planet where they find thousands of what seem to
be eggs. It would be harsh to spoil this films to the people
unfortunate not to see it, but poor old John Hurt has a terrible death
when a small, baby alien pops out of his stomach. I say 'pops out'
because new comers will want the surprises. The small Alien very
funnily zooms across the kitchen floor in the spaceship, where all the
crew members are left in silence, with a new addition to their crew, an
alien!<br /><br />Its great to see that no CGI was used in this film, as I have explained
that pure realism can't be beaten by hand made special effects in many
other reviews. All the aliens in this film were produced using puppets
and models, which look fantastic. I love the way you see the aliens
acid spill out their moths on the close up shots, and the shiny, silver
teeth. The acting is good and is probably the best performance we see
of Sigourney weaver in the alien series, as unfortunately, by the time
we get to alien3, its all getting a bit too much with the constant
&quot;F**k you, man!. There's just no need for it. Alien is a film to enjoy
because of the excellent directing, like The terminator. The sounds are
great, camera angle are good, and its a memorable flick.
