I went back and saw Alien on video again last weekend.  Must be about the
50th time I've seen it.  I know where all the scary scenes are, and it still
ties my intestines in a knot.  This movie is a classic.  Everthing is
classic - the lighting, the sets, the music.  And the outstanding job of
acting by all concerned really is what makes the movie
click.<br /><br />The subsequent stories in the Alien saga are cheap rip-offs; Hollywood
follows the traditional line of &quot;If we had one thing that was good, let's
clone the hell out of it and make a few more bucks.&quot;
