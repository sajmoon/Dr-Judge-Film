The commercial towing spaceship Nostromo is on a return trip to Earth,
after receiving a transmission it picks an Alien that terrorises the
crew of seven and they must fight for survival. <br /><br />Space, spaceships, androids and aliens, and no it&#x27;s not Starwars or
Startrek...<br /><br />Alien is a perfect blend of characterisation, visual effects, sound and
score. What separates this from the two franchises above is the gritty
realism, a brooding atmospheric and claustrophobic feel that has given
the film both cult and classic status. So much so it spawned its own
franchise.<br /><br />The acting is provided by a perfect heavy-weight cast that includes
John Hurt, Sigourney Weaver and Tom Skerritt. Dan O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s
screen-play, coupled with Ridley Scott&#x27;s visuals stop this becoming
just another monster alien movie or space film. The subject matter is
delivered completely seriously and you become immersed in the dread,
fear and uncertainty as even the main characters get killed off (which
has become common place these days). Who will be the hero or the
heroine?<br /><br />H.R.Giger creature designs of the face huger and Alien is the ace in
the hole and Jerry Goldsmith score mixed with the sound effects gives
the film a nightmarish feel that build up the tension to breaking
point. Scott&#x27;s direction is outstanding, creating the most fantastic
and memorable moments in film history which push your fear threshold.<br /><br />Compulsive viewing for Sci-fi fans who want story over action or in
this case a steak to digest instead of fast food. <br /><br />If you&#x27;ve never seen Alien what it treat it will be to watch it fresh.
