Now I know Independence Day came out way after Alien, but I wrote the Alien
comment after my Independence Day comment that's why I said Another Great
Alien Movie.<br /><br />Well Ridley Scott is the man. He did Alien better than any other alien movie
ever made. How the aliens in the movie looked was awesome. No one had ever
depicted aliens like that before and I don't think anyone had imagined that
aliens could be that violent or harmful to us. That's what made this movie
really great, the aliens(duh!)but I mean you have to see it to believe what
I mean.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver played a great part in this movie to. I don't think anyone
could have done it any better than she did, she was fit for the part. That's
another reason this movie was good. Now for those of you who do not like
Sigourney, well you should watch her in this movie, you might like her now.
If not that's ok.<br /><br />Now this wasn't the only Alien movie that was good out of all the movies(2,3
and 4)they were all great! Just as good and part 4 was even better than the
first. But hey, don't tell anyone, but I heard they are writing a script for
a part 5. <br /><br />8/10
Rated R for violence and language
Also Recommended: The Terminator movies and the other Alien
Movies.<br /><br />
