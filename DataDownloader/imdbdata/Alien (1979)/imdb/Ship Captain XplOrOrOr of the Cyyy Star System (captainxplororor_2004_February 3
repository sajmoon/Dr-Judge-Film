I was around 12yrs old when I first saw this movie, with my father, late
one night when it came on TV (back when families had only 1 TV in the
entire
house! :) I was throughly scared from watching anymore after the first
most
famous scene. I also didn't sleep good that night.
A few years later, around 14yrs of age, I saw it again on cable TV,
alone,
late at night.(we still had 1 TV in the entire house! But it was a new one
now :)
I forced myself to watch the entire movie and I absolutly ENJOYED it! I
was
shocked most at the fact the movie made me jump at certain
parts.
Right now I am past age 20. And whenever I re-watch it, there's at least
1
scene that still makes me jump heheh. Even though I know ahead of time
it's
coming.
Looking back now, I now understand what an incredible movie this was. It
DEFINED a new type of genre. It DEFINDED new situations, new F/X, and a
host
of new ideas. &quot;ALIEN&quot; went even further than the often mentioned &quot;THING&quot;.<br /><br />No movie since, fantasy or horror or sci-fi, has captured EVERYTHING that
defined what makes &quot;ALIEN&quot; a bona fid classic!
My most favorite part is that the &quot;enemy&quot; is just as smart, and even
smarter, than the main characters who are also very intelligent.
