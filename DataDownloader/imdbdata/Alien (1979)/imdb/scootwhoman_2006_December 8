When it first appeared, &#39;Alien&#39; was a totally new look for science
fiction. Ridley Scott turned away from the sparkling white of brand new
space ships, and turned to what has been called &#39;blue collar space&#39;.
The spacecraft was grubby, well used, the crew relaxed and focused on
their routine tasks. Routine, that is, if you happen to be part of a
crew of a space tug, one which hauls huge processor barges across light
year gulfs. To deal with the long mission times, the technique of
&#39;hibernation&#39; is used, which slows the body processes down to a faint
thread, retarding the physical effects of the passage of time.<br /><br />When the crew is awakened from hibernation by the ship&#39;s computer,
lovingly referred to as &#39;Mother&#39;, they expect that they are at the end
of another mission, about to see home again after years traveling the
emptiness. But their voyage has been interrupted, because Mother has
detected a signal, representing intelligent life. Protocol demands that
it be investigated. I found it very easy to identify with the crew
members as they contemplate landing on a strange planet, because they
were just ordinary folks, not intrepid explorers, or trained troops.<br /><br />What this crew finds on this primordial planet is a totally new concept
in horror, one which crawls right inside of you. This film has a visual
impact which altered the movie experience dramatically. The heartbeat
in the audio track and the strobe lighting effects seen so often in
todays films got their start in &#39;Alien&#39;. But this movie does not need
cheep effects to put you on the edge of your seat. Dan O&#39;Bannon&#39;s story
will do that quite well on its own.
