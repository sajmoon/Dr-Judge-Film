I walked out of the movie theatre in 1979 in awe of what I had just
seen. Alien is the perfect antidote for the warm fuzzies that I had
gotten from Star Wars. The characters are real and resonated with me.
The mood, the atmosphere created was completely creepy and wonderfully
set. By the time Brett is looking for Jonesy in the cargo bay, I was
ready to jump out of my skin. Even the space helmet on the bridge is
spooky.<br /><br />I still remember looking up on that warm August day and wondering just
was IS out there.<br /><br />Great film, and highly recommnded!
