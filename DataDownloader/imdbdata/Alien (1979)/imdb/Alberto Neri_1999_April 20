1999_April 20 

Alien is one classics Sci-fi movies. Magistrally directed by Mr. Scott and
well performed by the actors. The movie represents the darkness and the
paranoia in a claustrophobic space ship; giving the idea that once in the
ship the alien entity, is no way to scape.
Rydley Scott takes the darkest images of H. R. Geiger, and transforms that
images to horrorific &quot;tour de force&quot; with paranoic suspense.<br /><br />The theme and story is well related, and the content is simple but
excellent. The special effects (visual &amp; audio) are not part of the movie
(unlike Star Wars, where the effects is all and the only). Let me explain:
Lastly, with powerful supercomputers and super Hi-Tech devices like
Animatronics(tm) the special effects has a boom; and the new movies
(Godzilla, Species, ID4...) only have a huge amount of Fx but nothing or
almost nothing of contents.<br /><br />Alien, Bladerunner, 2001: a space odyssey, 12 Monkeys and other movies has
the authentic &quot;scence&quot; of science fiction.<br /><br />
