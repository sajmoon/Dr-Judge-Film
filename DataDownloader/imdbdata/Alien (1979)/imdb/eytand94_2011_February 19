&#x22;Alien&#x22; is set in the future, in deep space, on a ship called the
NOSTROMO. We are introduced to the seven members of the ship&#x27;s crew:
Dallas, Lambert, Brett, Kane, Ash, Parker, and Lieutenant Ellen Ripley.
Using the help of &#x27;Mother,&#x27; a piece of technology that helps them guide
the ship, the crew slowly makes their way back towards Earth. However,
they stop the ship when they find another in the middle of space.
There, they find a strange organism, an alien species that is far
beyond their knowledge. But that&#x27;s when the species escapes onto the
NOSTROMO, infecting Kane, who gives birth to a baby alien that was bred
inside of him. As the alien grows and runs amok, the crew is slowly
killed off one by one, leaving Ripley. Can she save herself, destroy
the organism, and find a way back home? <br /><br />I&#x27;m usually not a big fan of movies about space monsters. &#x22;Godzilla&#x22;
just doesn&#x27;t do it for me. However, &#x22;Alien&#x22; is more than a monster
movie. In fact, I don&#x27;t think I can even consider it a sci-fi film. To
me, it feels more like straight horror.<br /><br />Scripted by Dan O&#x27;Bannon from a Ronald Shusett story, and directed by
Ridley Scott, the film has a tremendous atmosphere. Knowing that you&#x27;re
stuck somewhere with no place to go lends an unbelievable sense of
claustrophobia and tension to &#x22;Alien.&#x22; <br /><br />Also, you see much more of the monster towards the end of the movie.
For most of the time that you&#x27;re watching the movie, the alien is kept
in the dark as it roams the ship. It could be anywhere at anytime, and
it&#x27;s smart. Actor Rider Strong of &#x22;Cabin Fever&#x22; says that &#x22;it&#x27;s much
more frightening when something&#x27;s intelligent and evil.&#x22; The monster in
&#x22;Alien&#x22; is a prime example.<br /><br />You also have an A-list cast, featuring Tom Skerritt as Dallas,
Veronica Cartwright as Lambert, and John Hurt as Kane. But once the
movie gets going, the real key to the film is Sigourney Weaver as
Ripley. Her character knows when something&#x27;s dangerous and should be
left alone. But when nobody listens to her, and they all die, she takes
control and she doesn&#x27;t go down without a fight. Weaver perfectly
portrays Ripley, and she has created an ideal heroine, like Jamie Lee
Curtis&#x27;s Laurie Strode of &#x22;Halloween.&#x22; Ridley Scott directs the film
with passion and dedication. He gives us all sorts of wonderful shots,
some being shaky and raw, putting fear in the audience and setting a
mood of unease. It&#x27;s safe to say that Scott was the best choice for the
job.<br /><br />To this day, &#x22;Alien&#x22; holds up extremely well. It hasn&#x27;t aged at all,
and doesn&#x27;t show signs of it happening either. The film is filled to
the brim with heart-stopping suspense and truly shocking scares,
especially the ending. Thanks to great direction, a very original story
and screenplay, genuine tension, a classic gross-out moment, and the
iconic performance of Sigourney Weaver, &#x22;Alien&#x22; is, was, and ever shall
be a flawless definition of what a monster movie should be. &#x22;In space,
no one can hear you scream!&#x22;
