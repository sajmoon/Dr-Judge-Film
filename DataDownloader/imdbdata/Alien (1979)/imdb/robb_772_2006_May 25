Director Ridley Scott&#x27;s entry in the post-STAR WARS science fiction
boom, the box office smash ALIEN ended up carving it&#x27;s own niche in the
genre and became a certifiable film classic in it&#x27;s right. The film&#x27;s
plot is nothing new or revolutionary in and of it&#x27;s self (the crew of a
spacecraft is trapped onboard with a carnivorous alien who picks them
off one by one), but Scott and screenwriter Dan O&#x27;Bannon wisely
downplay the typical genre gimmickry in favor of a deceptively
straightforward narrative. In fact, the film actually plays more like a
psychological cat-and-mouse thriller than a routine space adventure,
although the spacecraft setting lends the suspense a brilliantly
claustrophobic atmosphere that possibly could not have been duplicated
with an earth-bound setting. As the infamous tagline reads, &#x22;In space
no one can hear you scream.&#x22; <br /><br />The film is benefited greatly from the exceptional art and set
decoration, which is overflowing with rich detail and great
imagination. During every scene, every shot, and every frame, the
viewer is never less than totally convinced that they are in a lone
spacecraft floating through the solar system. The Oscar-winning special
effects remain highly convincing, including believable space travel and
a highly memorable &#x22;birth&#x22; scene for the titular creature. The creature
itself is marvelously designed, and Scott wisely keeps the alien hidden
in the shadows for the majority of the film, therefore increasing the
atmosphere and building suspense to an almost unbearable degree as the
fear of the unknown intensifies.<br /><br />The cast of characters includes an interesting assortment of tired
working stiffs and various other misfits - none of these individuals
are the virtuous heroes that plague most science fiction films, in fact
most of them are simple space age truckers - this assignment isn&#x27;t a
mission to them, it&#x27;s just a job. The cast is flawlessly chosen down to
the letter, with Tom Skerritt, Yaphet Kotto, Veronica Cartwright, Harry
Dean Stanton, John Hurt, and especially Ian Holm (in a extremely
chilling performance) all completely believable in their respective
roles. Best of all is then-newcomer Sigourney Weaver, in a towering
performance of strength and intelligence that is rare in this genre&#x27;s
typical characterization of women. Not only did Weaver&#x27;s exceptional
performance make the actress an overnight star, it also single-handedly
defined the female action heroine for the post-modern era.
