With the possible exception of &quot;Predator&quot; this movie is the best and
most intense science fiction movie ever made in the history of
Hollywood. This movie offers everything a movie should have - a great
story, excellent acting, a simple yet compelling plot, empathetic
characters and a creature that is merciless, frightening and loathsome.
Further, this movie stands the test of time and is as watchable today
as it was when it was first released in 1979. Every character in this
movie has an important role and every line in the script is taut with
tension as the crew of the space ship, isolated and alone in the middle
of nowhere, try to figure out how to defeat a monster that seems
invincible and is hunting them one-by-one. If you haven&#39;t seen this
movie, see it.
