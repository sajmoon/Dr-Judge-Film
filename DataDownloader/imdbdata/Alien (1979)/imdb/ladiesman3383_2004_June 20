Why can't they make sci/fi/ horror movies like this anymore? I am not a
huge fan of scifi but this film sticks to the meaning of horror and
shows it. In order to make a great movie, a good story is what counts
not good effects. Great cast, they all do their job, no one overacts.
Especially Sigourney Weaver and Ian Holm, they do great jobs.<br /><br />Also brilliant direction by Ridley Scott. When they made this movie,
they did'nt have CGI effects or digital editing. So give them credit.
The whole movie takes place inside a ship, so it combines
claustrophobia with other issues to give more of a scary feeling. Like
I said, it's the best of its kind. 10/10
