I'm not trying to rip of hear'say and their song but i'm gonna say with the
only exception of Aliens and Alien3 this movie was fantastic and one of the
few movies that i can watch again and again, the fact that there is so
little info on the alien and also the very physical apparence of the alien
makes u want to squirm, this movie was made incredibly well
done.<br /><br />The acting in this movie was second to none and also Ripley was incredible,
i can see where she got the personna of being a &quot;tough bitch&quot; because in
this movie it is incredible the way she acts and also the way that she is
portrayed, i would watch this again and again if only it wasn't so slow
moving, i admit that it works very well for building up tension in the right
mood, but if ur not in the right mood it just puts u 2 sleep
:(<br /><br />I won't critcise this movie because it is/was a master piece and it still is
very good. This movie is something that will go down in the annuals of
history as a very good movie, something to watch and feel very scared
by.
