This movie is a true classic. The user who says it's not as good as the
sequel is just plain wrong. It is a different kind of movie than the
sequel.
Aliens (the sequel) is shoot 'em up action movie, which this is not.
Ridley
Scott is a genius, pure and simple. He made this movie for next to nothing
budget wise, with no CGI and the result still stands up to this day. Only
2001 surpasses this film when it comes to effects, and that's a close race
to be sure.<br /><br />This movie is the best of the series, as far as I am concerned, because it
lays the ground work for what came later. Ridley Scott's dark vision of
the
future is a theme he repeated in Blade Runner. On the commentary for the
DVD
he mentions that he would like to make an Alien 5 which goes back to where
the Aliens came from to find out what they are. That's a movie I would
love
to see.
