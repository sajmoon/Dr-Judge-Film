That is simply it this movie is fantastic, Ridley's use of camera and mood
set a benchmark for other horror directors to follow. acompanied by how
little he actually showed of the Alien and how HUMAN the characters seem
to
be.
Now most will argue that yes Alien is a better film, in my personal
opinion
Alien is the best in the series, that's not to say i don't LOVE Aliens but
it's more of an action movie than a thriller/horror. this disapointed me
at
first but when i watched it again i just relised how cool it actually
was.
Thankfully Alien 3 was released which brought back all that suspence and
great camera and mood i love (especially when you see it from the Alien's
perspective, that's just down right freaky).
Alien 4.........well......um.....urrr........i'm sorry but it was just
crap,
focused way too much on gore and the cloning part? what the hell is with
that I mean even if they could bring her DNA back (out of hot lead!!!) the
chances of an Alien being inside yer a like the chances of me shuting up
about this awfull movie.
which i shall do know.
