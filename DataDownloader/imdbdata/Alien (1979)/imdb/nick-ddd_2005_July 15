I borrowed Alien Quadrilogy box set from a friend of mine and tried to
watch the Alien and I couldn't. Yes, Ridley Scott is a master. He does
his work very well and he, it seems, even had studied Kubrick's '2001:
A Space Odyssey' before. But the screenplay... One of the silliest I
ever seen. Every person acts like imbecile that has the only aim - to
die. Aliens are very spectacular and illogical (in my opinion). They
grow from embryo to huge monster having nothing to it, deposit eggs
that have more flesh than grown monster, and pour rivers of acid and
slime. Ah, and they kill :) The genre of the movie (according to IMDb)
is Sci-Fi / Horror / Thriller. I'd say it's horror/thriller under
sci-fi sauce. Some kind of sci-fi Jaws. The only Alien movie I liked is
Alien: Resurrection. It's really stylish and fun. And Sigourney Weaver
is a killer woman there :)
