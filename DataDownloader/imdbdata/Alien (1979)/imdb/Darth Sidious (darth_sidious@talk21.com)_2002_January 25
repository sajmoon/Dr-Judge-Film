Ridley Scott's ALIEN is an example of great horror film-making. It's not the
creature, but the design of the locations, the smoke, claustophobic rooms
and atomsphere. The characters are nicely written, this is not your
post-modern horror!<br /><br />ALIEN has a distinct style, the pacing is deliberate, the tension builds and
builds. The film is a real master stroke by Ridley Scott and his
team.<br /><br />The acting is excellent, I can't fault anyone. Weaver has the lead was a
gamble, and a brave choice by all concerned. I'm happy to say that it pays
off! The design of the ALIEN is fascinating, work of a
genius.<br /><br />The special effects are tremendous, again, there's a distinct style, it's so
fantastic!<br /><br />The score by Goldsmith plays more like a special sound effect, but it does
fit the mood of the picture.<br /><br />The wide-screen frame is used to the max, do not watch this in pan and
scan!<br /><br />ALIEN is a film which should be studied and studied, tons of details in the
entire picture.
