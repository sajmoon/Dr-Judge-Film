Christmas Day 2008 saw the release of the sequel/prequel &#39;Aliens vs.
Predator: Requiem,&#39; which was following a film that left many feeling
letdown. What looked to be not only a major improvement on it&#39;s
predecessor, also appeared to be a possible return to the glory of both
the &#39;Alien&#39; and &#39;Predator&#39; franchises. Sadly, this was not the case and
again the fans were disappointed with the final product. What appeared
on screens was a mindless, soulless exercise in greed, albeit an
entertaining one. But fans of these films expect better, and they
should.<br /><br />At this point it seems that Twentieth Century Fox no longer cares about
these franchises or their monsters. But there was a time when the name
&#39;Alien&#39; meant quality entertainment and film-making. In 1979 audiences
were scared out of their wits by what may be the most terrifying
Science Fiction/Horror film of all time, and by watching that film back
to back with the film I talked about in the beginning, you can see the
decline in quality. Where did it all go wrong? Could be a lot of
things, but until things start picking up for these series we still
have the originals to continue to enjoy.<br /><br />Pros: At the time these actors were virtually unknown, but they each do
an excellent job. Remarkable ship and interior designs. Sharp,
beautiful cinematography. Special effects that have held up very well.
The first half moves at a slow, steady pace to help the suspense and
then after the midpoint it moves right along. The quiet, dimly lit ship
interiors make it an eerie setting. The Xenomorph is one of the
scariest monsters to come along in the last few decades. Some well done
and well-placed scares. A subtle and effective score. Suspense is
maintained throughout.<br /><br />Cons: The concept of a crew landing on a planet and being attacked by
an alien species is nothing new, even at the time this film came out.
Some dated visual effects.<br /><br />Final thoughts: Nearly thirty years old and still packs a punch, this
classic Sci-Fi/Horror film is one of the best of it&#39;s kind. There&#39;s no
complete lack of good films of that type today, but they&#39;re few and far
in between. After the critical and financial failure of &#39;Aliens vs.
Predator: Requiem&#39; I hope that the people at Fox go back and watch the
earlier films and change their attitudes toward the series because it
deserves much more than a follow-up with cardboard characters,
paper-thin plot, and lack of innovation.<br /><br />My rating: 4.5/5
