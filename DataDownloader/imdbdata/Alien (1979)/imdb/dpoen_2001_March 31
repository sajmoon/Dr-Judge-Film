Simply the best and most original sci-fi film ever made. A career-maker for
every actor in it. My favorite! A scary rollercoaster ride down, down,
downhill into hell on an otherwise routine space voyage, which turns into
unbelievable tension throughout the film. One is never sure whether the
unwanted alien &quot;hitchhiker&quot; can ever be killed...
