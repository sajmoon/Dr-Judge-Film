Kristine's (kristinedrama14@aol.com) comments puzzle me a bit.  She admits
she found this movie to be &quot;creepy,&quot; that the acting is &quot;good,&quot; and that
Sigourney Weaver &quot;kicks ass.&quot;  However, the movie is apparently ruined for
her because of the technical errors, which are apparently not up to some
undefined standards (Star Trek: TNG, maybe?)<br /><br />She points out some issues she has, especially the presence of &quot;gravity&quot; on
the ship, and then states that she could have told the film-makers how to
make more than half of the movie much better.<br /><br />OK...I'll bite, Kristine.  What would you change?  I'm genuinely
interested.<br /><br />Regarding your other issues, I agree that the presence of &quot;gravity&quot; on the
ship is indeed a bit of a stretch, but I think that you would have been just
as upset if there had been some long discourse on how they achieve this at
that point in the future.  (I don't recall that &quot;Solaris&quot; ever took time to
explain THEIR gravity.)  As far as your other complaints....<br /><br />Any planet with sufficient mass is going to have gravity similar to earth's.
 Why would they need &quot;super suits&quot;?<br /><br />The Nostromos is a space-going tug.  It is SUPPOSED to be in minimal
condition, with water leaks, faulty lighting, undependable systems, etc. 
One of the director's goals was to show &quot;unglamorous&quot; commercial activity in
space.  It's the equivalent of an old ocean-going freighter with a pick-up
crew.<br /><br />So, lighten up, Kristine!<br /><br />OK, with all that out of my system, let me say that this is a classic movie.
 It is one of those rare movies that is much better in the theater with
other viewers, since their reactions feed your own.  DO NOT MISS THIS
RE-RELEASE!!
