One can not approach this film looking for mindless entertainment. I'm not
claiming that it is thought-provoking or of great worth as profound social
commentary, but what &quot;Alien&quot; *is* is a science-fiction thriller that demands
your full attention and involvement.<br /><br />There is almost nothing to criticise about this film. The actors are
excellent, especially Sigourney Weaver (Ellen Ripley), Ian Holm (Ash), and
Yaphet Kotto (Parker). The plot is tightly-written and extremely
suspenseful, with more than enough surprises to pick things up when the pace
slackens.<br /><br />Speaking of pace, this *is* a slow film, but this is not to its detriment.
It actually serves to heighten the tension - a particular highlight would be
the final scene inside the shuttle.<br /><br />See this film. Now. I'm not kidding.
