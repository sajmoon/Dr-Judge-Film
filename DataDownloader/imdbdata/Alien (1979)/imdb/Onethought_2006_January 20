I give it a 10/10 without doubt. I am not giving it a 10/10 out of
compassion but because of the creative and cinematographic
(relative)perfection. Please mind that even though it has a new
directors cut re-release, this movie is actually a full 25 years old!!!
Even when you watch it now it stands it own and that is the
magnificence of the art-director and of Ridley Scott, the film
director.<br /><br />Ah then you get to see one of the best (or simply the best) female
action heroes ever created on screen. Sigourney Weaver is just so
memorable. Please don't forget that the brilliance of this movie
launched a whole quadrology. That itself is a testament to this first
one: Alien. The second one Aliens directed by James Cameroon is an epic
in itself but much of the foundation was (perhaps inadvertently) laid
by Ridley Scott in this movie. Please note another side effect was that
female heroes were used by Hollywood after this movie in very big
productions.<br /><br />Each shot, each scene and sequences build up the film in a fantastic
manner that is old school but still so difficult to achieve. It is like
Da Vinchi's painting. It is old school style. But still difficult to
do. Story is about the crew of a mining ship who end up with an alien
while answering an SOS call. Alien: not as in an illegal immigrant
(er.. this is not a political movie about borders and immigration...)
Alien as in the most scary creature ever devised. Truly alien. In every
way it is so brilliant. <br /><br />I had a great experience when I watched it again. Definitely one of the
all time greatest movies.
