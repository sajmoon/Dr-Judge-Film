Ridley Scott's 1979 classic is back on the big screen with a few minor
changes, just in time for Halloween. <br /><br />Though it obviously has sci-fi qualities, &quot;Alien&quot; is first and foremost a
horror film, and it's a grim and relentless one. The giant ship Nostromo
that it takes place on plays the role of a haunted house and the Alien is
like the killer in a slasher film, picking off members of the cast one by
one. <br /><br />However, its simplicity is exactly what gives it the raw charge it's always
had. Like John Carpenter's great, underrated remake of &quot;The Thing&quot; that came
out 3 years later, it gives us a cast of likable, middle-aged working
stiffs, puts them in contact with a hostile alien presence, and coldly
observes as they scramble for their lives, resulting in nearly unbearable
and uniquely realistic suspense. <br /><br />This was the first time I'd ever seen &quot;Alien&quot; on the big screen (I was 1
year-old when it came out), and I really enjoyed it. Some of the special
effects look a little cheesy now, but most of them still look great.<br /><br />As for the monsters, the egg-laying spider creature is still one of the
ickiest in movie history, and the H.R. Giger designed mother Alien is a
vicious, slimy beast that is not quite like any other.<br /><br />The cast is great too, especially Sigourney Weaver as Ripley (of course),
Tom Skeritt as the ship's studly captain (he'll survive a long time,
right?), and Yaphet Kotto and Harry Dead Stanton, who are immensely
enjoyable as two constantly grumbling mechanics. <br /><br />&quot;Alien&quot; is a great movie, but there a few slow patches and I've always felt
that it takes a little too long to really start kicking ass. Those are very
minor flaws, though, and are all that's keeping it from my 4-star rating.<br /><br />As good as &quot;Alien&quot; is, it would get dwarfed (in my opinion and many other
peoples') by its 1986 sequel, James Cameron's astoundingly intense &quot;Aliens&quot;,
a brilliant action/sci-fi/horror film that is so good it's renowned as a
masterpiece in all three of those genres. Compared to that movie, &quot;Alien&quot;
looks downright humble. But it gets to job done, and done
good.
