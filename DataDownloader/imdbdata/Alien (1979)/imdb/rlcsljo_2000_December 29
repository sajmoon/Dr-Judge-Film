2000_December 29 

This film is obviously the &quot;Star Wars&quot; of outer space horror films and I was
almost as blown away at the originality of this movie as I was with the
special effects in &quot;Star Wars&quot;.<br /><br />Unfortunately, on a &quot;Creature Feature&quot; late night program I got to see what
was left out--and I was even more blown away and disappointed with the
theatrical release.<br /><br />Although later pictures in the Alien series gave of some of this, what the
hell was Ridley Scott thinking?  He had left most of the good stuff out.  I
subtracted 2 points from a 10 for stupidity!
