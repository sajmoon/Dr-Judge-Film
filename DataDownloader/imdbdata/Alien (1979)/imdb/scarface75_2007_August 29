One of the first and actually best Sci-fiction/Horror films I have ever
seen. Still remember the voice of interpreter who translates this film
into Russian &quot;Kommerceskiy Kosmicheskiy Tyagach Nostromo&quot;... Later on,
having learned the language of John Lennon and Michael Caine, you
realize how wonderful dubbing was in original language. The actors are
perfect and Sigourney Weaver is still one of my favorite actresses. She
is the best &quot;Rambo-style&quot; lady starring in the movies. Can&#39;t think of
anyone else... Ian Holm, Dr Ash is very excellent with the role he is
playing. John Hurt, Veronica Cartrayt and the rest of the crew are
amazing! Just amazing. The second film by Sir Ridley, which is a real
classic
