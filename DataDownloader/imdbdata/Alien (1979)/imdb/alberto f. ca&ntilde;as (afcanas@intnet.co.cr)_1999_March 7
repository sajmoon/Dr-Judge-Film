1999_March 7 

I missed the picture in 1979 and have just seen it. It is everything I had
heard and read about it. A real classic of horror, more than of sci-fi. The
visual style of Ridley Scott never fails. The musical background deserved an
Oscar. After twenty years, nothing better has been done in the
genre.
