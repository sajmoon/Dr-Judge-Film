If you didn&#39;t watch this movie a long time ago...well than you know
what to do, WATCH IT NOW:) Hurry!!!! This Movie is AMAZING. Its so old
but still so good. A space nightmare you will never forget!<br /><br />This movie is a true classic. I still remember the first time i saw
this movie. You feel the horror in the atmosphere all the way, and it
really feels like your in deep space facing your worst fears.<br /><br />All of the four movies are good. But this is the true classic you just
cant miss out on.<br /><br />Directed by the master Ridley Scott. With Tom Skerritt, Sigourney
Weaver, Veronica Cartwright and on and on..
