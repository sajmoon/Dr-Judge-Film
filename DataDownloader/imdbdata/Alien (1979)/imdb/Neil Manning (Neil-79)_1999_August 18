1999_August 18 

When this film first came out, I was immediately fascinated; not only by
the
strong visuals but also the perfect ensemble acting.  John Hurt's death
scene alone is a classic.  I watch this film at least once a year and it
never seems dated and is never boring.  This is probably the film which
made
me watch movies on another level; not only as mere entertainment, but as
something more; something to appreciate and savor like a great meal or
fine
wine.  Friends constantly tell me &quot;yeah, but 'Aliens' was better&quot; (much
like
the people who post here) and I am always telling them why it is a very
good
film, but totally different from the classic original.  Not since &quot;King
Kong&quot; has a movie monster so indelibly and originally burned itself into
our
collective psyche - watch &quot;Alien&quot; again (with the lights
out).
