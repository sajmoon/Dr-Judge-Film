I tell you i cant get enough of this film. Ridley Scott is a definite
master of suspense to say the least. this movie takes you by the hair
and smacks you up against the screen and doesn't let you go until the
final sequence. brilliantly acted and shot. mind you it does leave you
wanting more, thank gosh for aliens..<br /><br />Now this is what I'm talking about, something that is original,
beautifully shot and acted well. Everything else i have seen in the
last twenty plus years is just a poor attempt to conjure up the magic
and mystery of this film. And as for some comment someone wants to see
a remake? yeah right, you wont even come close to capturing the
original horror of this masterpiece. if you want to remake a movie you
should maybe do what, STARWARS... don't even think it, it would be
sacrilegious...
