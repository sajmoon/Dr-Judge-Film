&quot;In space, no one can hear you scream.&quot; This remains my favourite
tagline ever for a movie. When 'Alien' was released in 1979, it caused
almost as much talk as 'Star Wars' did when released two years earlier.
The science fiction genre was being revolutionized at this time and
'Alien' had a horror characteristic to it which was psychological,
visually striking and compelling with the type of strength in silence
not seen since '2001: A Space Odyssey' in 1968. Definitely a big
influence in blockbuster film making, 'Alien' has spawned three sequels
so far and is a great horror/science-fiction classic not to be missed.
It is director Ridley Scott's best effort on the big screen for making
fear the best character in the film.
