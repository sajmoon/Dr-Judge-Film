Alien is quite possibly the most terrifying film to come out in the
twentieth century, hands down. The most bizarre part of the film is
also its most horrifying elliment; the chestburster scene. No one in
1979 expected that scene, and few ever predict it today. Rarely has a
movie stretched beyond its original generation in this way. It is a
very strange movie indeed. The plot itself is original in its own
regard as a sci-fi. Then we get to the script (which is excellently
paced and drawn-out), the characters (all having their own problems and
weeknesses), and of course, the creature. Alien&#39;s creature is so
memorable in so many ways that it is impossible for me to sleep without
feeling a slight pain in my chest. Never before (and probably never
again) has a movie ever made a person afraid of their own insides like
Alien. Other films try to use outward scares... but Alien uses the
imagination as its vecter... and it works flawlessly.
