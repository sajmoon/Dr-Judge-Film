The Alien movies are some of the best alien movies that I've ever
watched.
Sigourney Weaver, aka (RIPLEY)fits the part very well. The first Alien
movie
probably is the best of them all but all four of them are good. An Alien
vs
Predator would be an interesting turn but Alien 5 would be worth seeing.
Most seem to disagree with an Alien 5. It can be done with the right
people
behind it.<br /><br />Z.D. Screenplay Writer*
