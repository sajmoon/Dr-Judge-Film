I watched this again recently as part of the Quadrilogy release. This
was perhaps the first time all the way through since I missed it in the
theaters (I was a newlywed and still in college...no money for movie
tickets back then!). I am very impressed with how well this film has
stood up over the years. The plot, while basic, does hold the attention
of the audience. The acting is superb across the board and each of the
actors makes the most out of the roles and clearly differentiates the
characters. The special effects are very effective, even though they
don't stack up to Star Wars or Close Encounters due to the film's
limited budget. It is actually a very good thing that Ridley Scott did
not attempt to make the same type of special-effects movie, since the
plot, acting, and directing clearly carry the movie without it. In
fact, this movie is much better than most movies that rely heavily on
special effects, especially those cgi-heavy offerings such as The Hulk,
The Matrix, and The Day After that offer nothing but special effects.
