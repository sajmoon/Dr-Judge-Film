The ship in the beginning of the movie looks like it crash landed on the
plant. When the 3 navigators climb into the ship they come across a
huge pilot being - as they come closer to it, one of them says that it
is so old that it looks like it been for years and that the whole body
was part of the chair, but as camera comes to a close shot it looks
like the being chests had a hole in it, from what it looks like an
alien popped out of the pilots chest. This would mean that the ship
already had the alien on board and crashed landed on this distant
planet because of it. Where did the aliens originate from and when.
What type of Alien race came from that ship?
