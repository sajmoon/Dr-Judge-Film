   Dark, foreboding, sinister. Ridley Scott has created a world of shadows
that conceal a lurking predator within the sealed hull of a space cargo
ship. An alien creature who's sole drive is to survive, and that can only be
accomplished with the death of the crew of the Nostromo. &quot;IT, the Terror
from Beyond Space&quot; is a forerunner of this film, but Scott has elevated the
horror story way beyond those 50's monster flicks(don't get me wrong, I love
those old horror films).The tensions build slowly and then reach fever
pitch.From a deserted rock of a planet to the dark cooling tunnels of the
ship, Scott has created a vision of the future that looks and feels
authentic.A landmark film that changed the look of this genre for a long
time to come.
   The cast is perfect, especially Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. She defines
the strong woman that can control her destiny instead of succumb to it. A
highly recommended film.
