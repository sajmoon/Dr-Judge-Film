This is an excellent story that follows a crew of a ship in outer space.
They
find an abandoned ship on a desolet planet. The events that occur after
that are for those who have seen the movie. this is personally my favorite
movie of all time, i would suggest it to people who like suspence scifi or
riddly scott. what is so brilliant about this movie is how low budget it
is.
it is so amazing how scott turned this low budget movie into an award
winning special effects thrill ride. This to me is directing at its peak. i
think this is the most thirlling movie since vertigo. i would give this
10/10
