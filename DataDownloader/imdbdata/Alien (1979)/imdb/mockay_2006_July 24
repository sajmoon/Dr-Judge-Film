While the first in the Alien series doesn&#39;t really compare to the
second, Aliens, this movie is what sets up the entire thing in the
first and if you watched it before seeing Aliens, then the latter would
have been even more enjoyable and even better than the best movie ever
made it already is. You should of course, be intrigued by the Alien.
Besides which, you are better of seeing the Alien-1 directors cut over
again, followed by another dose of Aliens rather than Alien-3 and Alien
resurrection. Its hard to believe that the audience which was once
scared and intimated by the Alien through the first two movies, is now
laughing at the very same Alien after cinematic abominations like AVP.
