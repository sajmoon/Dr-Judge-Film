back in 1977, there was only &#x22;starwars&#x22;, then there was nothing for a
while, and then there was &#x22;alien&#x22;, the highly contaminated answer to
Lucas&#x27;s clean multicultural splendor.<br /><br />nowadays the average sci-fi consumer is spoiled by various sagas and
serials where female superiors command all kinds of space vessels and
task forces, but in the late seventies Ripley was quite a thing to
digest for the patriarchal oriented crowd.<br /><br />no noble heroes fighting final battles for honor and glory. A lone
woman desperately struggling to get the hell out of unholy disaster. <br /><br />that&#x27;s already what makes &#x22;alien&#x22; stand out &#x22;inter pares&#x22;. but the
intriguing fact that commercial structures showed their dirty and
ultimately dangerous face for the first time in a futuristic ambiance,
makes it even more clairvoyant.<br /><br />just another grave sociological forecast we all got quite acquainted
with these days...
