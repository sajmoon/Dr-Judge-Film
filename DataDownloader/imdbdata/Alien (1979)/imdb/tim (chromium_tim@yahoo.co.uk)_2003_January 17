I was truly horrified By H R Geigers alien design. Somehow he has managed
to
create a believable terrifying creature where so many other horror
creatures
are just laughable. i cant quite put my finger on why (maybe its lack of
eyes or the inner mouth) but the effect to me was staggering. Ridley scott
blew the cinema apart with this dark film with VERY dark consequences. The
story is slick and the feeling that humanity has gone down the tubes
somewhat is ever present. This is NOT a future i would like to live
in.
There needs to be far more films of this kind out there but i fear this is
but a pipedream as the effect must be almost impossible to
re-create.<br /><br />10/10
