&quot;Alien&quot; has it all--solid plotline, terrific cast, and a level of suspense
that its many imitators (like that Schwarzenegger thing with that midwestern
governor) can only dream off.  The movie scared the living fertilizer out of
me the first time I saw it--and that was in a well-lit room, on a small
screen, with a dozen people around me!<br /><br />This movie rightfully made Sigourney Weaver a star, and the supporting cast
is excellent.  Ian Holm is absolutely chilling as the science officer Ash,
and the sequence in which Parker (Yaphet Kotto, one of the most underrated
actors of our time) and Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) confront the alien is
brilliant.  Cartwright in particular gets the human-in-the-alien's-headlights
look just perfect--her eyes get incredibly wide and her body just locks into
place.  Hearing the result over Ripley's comlink is much more effective than
seeing it would have been.<br /><br />A+++.  One of the greats.
