One of the best sci-fi films ever made - probably THE best sci-fi flick
ever.<br /><br />Ridley Scott delievers an absolute masterpiece. Alien is one of his best
films to date, only his direction in Gladiator comes a close second. Scott
keeps the viewer gripped with his intense camera angles, the amazing sets
complete with spectacular scenery and a good cast.<br /><br />Probably one of the best reasons to see this film is if you really want to
get scared, squirm, or revel in the adrealine rush - this film has it
all.<br /><br />Probably the best bit is the way the alien creature bursts out of John
Hurt's t-shirt at the dinner scene. I wasn't expecting it to happen and it
was so vivid and well acted by Mr Hurt, the special effects are just
fabulous.<br /><br />This film made Sigorney Weaver one of the few actresses that I really
respect and appreciate.<br /><br />7 out of 10
