Ridley Scott is an excellent director to think this on up. he is
imaginative and an extremely creative man.i expected an alien to come
out of Kane's chest but I'm probably the only one.the adult really
flabbergasted me 100% though I've seen some deleted scenes that I'm
glad he left out.i was on the edge of my seat all of the time.that man
knows how to make a scary movie. when i reach the age of 69 i will
still enjoy it as much as i did the first time i saw it. that movie
definitely makes it among my top 3 favorite movies second only to its
sequel aliens. it is probably the best movie he has made and will be a
favorite of many horror fans for generations to come
