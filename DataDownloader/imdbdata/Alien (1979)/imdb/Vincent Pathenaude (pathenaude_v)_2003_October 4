This film ages like good wine. Basically an artistically enhanced remake
of
the excellent
1958 sci-fi classic It! The terror from beyond space, Alien's reputation
unfortunately
suffers from the mediocre sequels that followed (the very effective ALIENS<br /><br />notwithstanding). But such is the horror of american cin&eacute;ma: a good film
is
no longer
regarded as an &quot;oeuvre&quot; by the general public when sequels occur, but
instead a chapter
in a movie series...<br /><br />Alien is simply beautiful and poetic. From the opening sequence of the
Nostromo
&quot;waking up&quot; to the bars of Jerry Goldsmith's breathtaking score (one of
the
master's
best-and that is saying a lot!) to the horrific sensuality of H.R. Giger's
Alien designs,
Ridley Scott's work is a sight of wonder.<br /><br />I hope the director's cut will not ruin this film like so many others
have.
You know, when
a film works without a scene, it follows that this scene was not
necessary
to begin with.
We&quot;ll see.
