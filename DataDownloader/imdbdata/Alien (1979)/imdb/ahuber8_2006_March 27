This is a flawless movie, and plot-wise neat, suspenseful and
edge-of-the-seat exciting; Sigourney Weaver's performance (especially
in the closing sequences) is simply outstanding. It is one of those
rare movies that also has an even better sequel (&quot;Aliens&quot;), but it is
still a fantastic stand-alone flick, too. Many of the other actors'
characters are terrific, and the first little alien's &quot;entrance&quot; is one
of the slickest effects I have ever seen--you could almost feel John
Hurt's pain. (It is my understanding that the other actors in that
scene weren't aware of exactly what was going to happen, so that their
reactions could be filmed just as they occurred, and it was terrific.)
Every character in this movie is believable and realistic; &quot;Alien&quot;
really succeeds in every aspect. I have a videotape in which I blended
the end of this with the beginning of &quot;Aliens&quot; to make a single
five-hour adventure and I watch it often--it seems I get more out of it
every time. Sheer sci-fi joy!
