I think many people will disagree with me but I think that this movie
have some huge flaws. I liked the creepy atmosphere which the director
of this movie succeeded to make, the Alien looked great and the idea
was pretty original for that time movie. What I found disappointing was
that there was to little action, all the victims of Alien died almost
without a fight and the Alien itself didn&#39;t get much of the show. I&#39;m
not a big fan of space-movies (Star Wars would be an exception), but I
found this film being very interesting, only there was too little of
all the good stuff. I haven&#39;t seen a second part yet, but I hope it
will be better.
