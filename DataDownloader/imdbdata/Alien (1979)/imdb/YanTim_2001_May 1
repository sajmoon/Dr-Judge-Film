The Aliens series is the only movie that comes to mind when I think of
movies that truly scared/disgusted me.  The original is the best, I feel,
because it has the strongest sense of alienation (har dee har har) of the
series.  The movie is full of great shots of the virtually empty ship on
which a human and an extraterrestrial clash.  Some of the shots and tranquil
moments are extremely eerie, as your eyes are being led around the
ship.
