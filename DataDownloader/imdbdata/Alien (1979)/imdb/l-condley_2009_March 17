Alien is a film that has been summed up in the past as a slasher film
in space. This summation does absolutely no justice to the mastery of
Ridley Scott&#39;s iconic sci-fi. To a certain degree the plot outlines a
standard horror set-piece i.e. a motley group of humans find themselves
trapped with a nasty beasty intent on gorging itself on them. But there
is so much more to admire in all aspects of what is Ridley Scott&#39;s
finest film (in my humble opinion.)<br /><br />The opening titles perfectly set the mood of the picture with the
atmospheric soundtrack and hieroglyph-like appearance of the word
ALIEN. The first half an hour has been criticised as being too slow,
but it is absolutely necessary to heighten the suspense and
anticipation of what we know is going to happen. This period also
serves to establish the underlying sense of dread and isolation that
runs through the film. Scott&#39;s direction is superb, and the acting of
the ensemble is also to be admired (in particular Sigourney Weaver, and
a slightly menacing Ian Holm.)<br /><br />But from the most famous sequence in the film involving John Hurt
onwards - the pace never lets up and there are some truly terrifying
sequences involving the alien. By the final act the film&#39;s intensity
goes into overdrive, as the screen becomes a blur of whirring Klaxons,
strobe lights and nasty aliens menacing little ginger cats. <br /><br />The alien design itself is also amazing. Giger&#39;s creation is a sleek,
balletic, beautiful but deadly beast and is a world away from the
snarling, screeching, insectoid xenomorph of later films. It moves with
a grace and sinister sensuality. Indeeed there are many sexual and
sensual undercurrents to the film, both subtle and overt. This ties in
the a great deal of Giger&#39;s artwork over his career. <br /><br />All in all, Alien is without a doubt a masterpiece. Although it belongs
in the genres of Science Fiction and Horror, it is an almost perfect
execution of both and certainly deserves a mention in the all time
greatest films category.
