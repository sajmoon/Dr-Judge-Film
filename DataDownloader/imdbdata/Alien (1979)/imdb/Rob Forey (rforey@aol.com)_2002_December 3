The worst part of ALIEN has got to be the appallingly pretentious Freudian
psychoanalytical interpretation of the film put forth by Barbara Creed in
The Monstrous-Feminine: Film, Feminism, Psychoanalysis (London, 1993).  The
assumption that the fear produced by ALIEN is based upon the fear of the
castrating archaic mother is so general it fails to carry any weight.  While
instances of maternal separation are seen (the Alien bursts through Kane's
body) and the notion of individuality being achieved by these means is an
interesting one, the attribution of Freudian philosophy to this film as a
whole is a stretch to say the least.  How can one argue against such a
sweeping analysis when all other arguments are countered with subconscious
motivation?!  The unconscious argument assumes that society as a whole
maintains the same subconscious interpretation, a fact I find very hard to
believe.  It would also imply some sort of unlevelled genius in the film
making process who could transcend consciousness and develop a conscious
idea into a subconscious response - again, doubtful on such a scale. 
Creed's approach also fails to take into account filmic industrial history
and the audience's interpretation of the movie.<br /><br />My interpretation of the fear induced by ALIEN holds with the idea of
primordial instinct.  The natural fight-or-flight instinct found in animals
when confronted with a predator is masterfully used to create a feeling of
fear due to the setting in which ALIEN takes place.  Trapped in a
spacecraft, there is no place to hide from the super-predator.  The setting
acts as a prison rather than a womb as asserted by Creed.  The appearance of
the Alien in such abject terms serves not to equate it with &quot;monstrous
femininity&quot;, but simply to disturb through the abject itself.  While not as
repulsive as many other scenes (the eye-cutting scene in Bunuel and Dali's
UN CHIEN ANDALOU being the most disturbing filmic scene in my opinion), the
image of the Alien is nonetheless unattractive to human emotion in all its
puss-filled, slimy glory.<br /><br />Creed goes on to say that the film deals with the mother's rejection and
deception of her children - we find that 'Mother' had been following the
robotic science officer's commands all along and had thought of the humans
as &quot;expendable&quot;.  I would add to this argument the role that the company
(who the crew are working for) play in deceiving humanity.  It was, after
all, the company who sent the crew to their ultimate deaths.  Whether this
fact should be interpreted as a commentary on unseen evils or on the
soulless and inhumane nature of the corporation, I leave open to debate. 
However, I would argue that this aspect of the film should be examined
further in order to assess the claims of Ridley Scott as
auteur.<br /><br />Personally I did not like the film and am not a great fan of the
sci-fi/horror genre.  However, if you are interested in film analysis (and
not just necessarily psychoanalysis-as is commonly held with this particular
film) then I would urge you to see this film if for no other reason than as
a subject of debate.  After that, rent THE SHINING and enjoy the best horror
movie ever made.
