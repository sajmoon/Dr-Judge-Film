As someone who has earned a little legitimate money from this franchise, I
have 
to say, absolutely without bias...Ridley did the best job, period.  This is
a 
phenomenal film, on almost very level.   A stunning piece of work, and an<br /><br />example of how to do sci-fi art direction on multiple levels.  (And let's
not go into 
the incredible sound mix, and Goldsmith's stellar score)<br /><br />Everyone after this (even the &quot;Almighty Cameron&quot;) destroyed the franchise in<br /><br />some way.  The new DVD box set only emphasizes its sequels'
deficiencies.<br /><br />Accept no substitutes.
