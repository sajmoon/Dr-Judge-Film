This is not a scary movie, but indeed a gross one. The reasons this
movie is stupid are that they wasted the first hour of the film doing
absolutely nothing, and there was so much use of unnecessary gore and
graphic violence that it made the film ridiculously stupid. Just take
out the &quot;stupi&quot; in stupefying and add a D to the end. That will tell
you everything you need to know. If you want a scary movie that won't
make you heave when you look at water and milk and think they're alien
drool, don't rent this garbage. I wish I had never seen this disgusting
film, because I truly would have been better off without seeing it.
Back then in the 70's, scary movies were absolutely disgusting and
gory, so I'd rent something new that's from our time if I were you.
