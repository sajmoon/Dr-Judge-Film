2000_June 8 

I didn't see the movie until this year (2000), mainly because I thought it
probably wasn't my kind of thing.  Then I saw Gladiator, which I loved, and
I knew I liked Blade Runner, so I decided to give Ridley's other movies a
go.<br /><br />Of course I realise that it would not seem as shocking or frightening or
technically innovatory today as it did 21 years ago, but I really felt that
it was not a particularly good film, and certainly nowhere near the
standard
of the two mentioned above.  Perhaps it just hasn't stood the test of
time.
