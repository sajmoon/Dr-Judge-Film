Alien 1979- Directed by Ridley Scot Runtime - 116 min (director's cut) <br /><br />When you're 11.&#133;. Every one can hear you scream&#133;&#133;&#133;<br /><br />In the summer of 1979 my friend David and I hopped on a east bound bus
to a local theatre where Dave's brother worked. We bought tickets
(Blazing Saddles- Remember, it was 1979!) and were discreetly escorted
to our seats with the help of Dave's older brother. We sat in the back
giddy, and full of anticipation. <br /><br />Were going to see Alien. <br /><br />117 minutes later the giddy was but a memory. I distinctly remember
walking the 7 km's home (Dave opted for the bus.) in full daylight,
sweating, scared out of my wits.<br /><br />So began my love-hate relationship with Ridley Scots classic 'Alien'.<br /><br />Fast forward 25 years and this movie still has the capability to haunt
me. Albeit the experience is more visceral than craven. <br /><br /> From the opening frames, with it's hieroglyphic like credits and
haunting score complete with insect clicks and murmurs, it establishes
an atmosphere of un-easyness that never subsides. <br /><br />Weavers breakout performance, combined with the brilliantly original
designs of then unknown Hans Rudy Giger (without whom this film may
have been destined for mediocrity) produced a cinematic classic that
has stood the test of time. Spawning increasingly dismal sequels but
defying the stigma of remake. &quot;Alien&quot; being a much more cerebral movie
than its sequels, it remains testament to filmmakers craft of a bygone
era. <br /><br />Scott's bold, uncompromising attitude at the helm of the project defied
conventional film-making and traditional thinking of the era. (In my
mind this is when the woman's movement began.) Moody sets and largely
restrained performances give Alien a gritty wake up call to many an
idyllic futurist. Trends that we see today, hark all to loudly to a
future imperfect. Child actress Cartwright and British thespian Holm
provide performances of studied, well-defined characters. Where Kotto
and Stanton, as the surly labourers, seem almost improvisational.
Giving a 'blue collar in space' or 'truckers in space' feel that writer
O'Bannon intended.<br /><br />Comic relief could almost come a cross as unseemly. (e.g. The character
of Hudson in Aliens) Belaying the serious plight of these 7 doomed
astronauts.<br /><br />( Not to mention having your sense of disbelief bust a leaf spring) <br /><br />The Directors cut has introduced additional footage integrated into the
film. Most notably the much rumoured death scene of Capt. Dallas. And a
magnificent shot of a seemingly sessile Alien as it stalks a oblivious
Harry Dean Stanton. However these additions do detract to the pacing of
the finished product making the 1979 theatrical release (Sharpened to
perfection without any annoying 'digital' fixes and a DTS soundtrack to
boot) a far better choice. <br /><br />If you manage to see Alien in it's theatrical re-release you know few
films benefit from being in the seclusion of a darkened movie theatre.
Where there is no escape and everyone can hear you scream!<br /><br />Go to the movies&#133;&#133;&#133; <br /><br />FD
