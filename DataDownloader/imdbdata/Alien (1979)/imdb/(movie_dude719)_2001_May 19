Alien: **<br /><br />&quot;Alien&quot; is said to be a classic. I mean, it's on the Top 250 list, so I
thought it would be good. So I rented it. And I had a lot of problems with
it. <br /><br />&quot;Alien&quot; is about a crew in a space ship who find an extra-terristrial.
Unlucky for them, it's not &quot;E.T.&quot; it's a vicious killer. One by one it kills
off the crew of Nostromo. Amongst the crew is Ripley (Sigourny Weaver) and
Lt. Dallas (Tom Skirret). <br /><br />My main problem with &quot;Alien&quot; is that there is too much build up and not
enough payoff. The movie builds up and builds up for a final sequence which
turns out disappointing. And, it's kind of predictable. I mean, who woulda
thought that if someone goes looking for a cat by themself is gonna end up
dead? The movie uses that formula a few times. The Alien itself is not
impressive. You can barely see it, and when you do it doesn't look any
better than the old &quot;Godzilla&quot;. <br /><br />Just because I didn't think it was a good movie, doesn't mean I don't like
it. It's cheesy in a fun way, but I can't overlook my other problems. I
respect the film. I also understand that they didn't have great computer
effects back in '79, but they could have made the Alien look better. So, as
for number 72 on the Top 250, I don't agree. But hey, that's just my
opinion.
