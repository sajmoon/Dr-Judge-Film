Alien is a definitive experience. Just thinking back at the
difficulties one had to face when approaching a genre which is nowadays
filled with CGI, makes the feeling of admiration just surges within me. <br /><br />Despite the fact that we get the same main element, the alien, the
stories change. This first movie, as usually the most important of the
whole series, is certainly a milestone for all horror and sci-fi films.<br /><br />I would like to be able to tell the story from an objective point of
view, but I consider it quite hard, as this type of movie, the horror
type, is a disputed one. Each person can decide if it will or will not
view such kind of movies. It is hardly probable that a person who does
not like horror movies, will like this one. For one thing, horror
movies will never win a major academy award, as they do not have what
ALL people want to see. But if you want to be entertained, then this
type of movie can get it on for you. Sci-Fi and Horror will always ring
a scream in my head: Alien.<br /><br />Spoilers<br /><br />The story is simple at the beginning...sometime in the future, a cargo
ship detects a signal from a planet, and it awakes the crew to check on
what it might be. Until the chosen ones get to the planet we get a
strange, but scary atmosphere. The planet itself is most obviously
against the presence of human life, as the conditions are
unfavorable(this will not be the same in Aliens though...does humanity
win? Or does that planet really represent the end of human life? We
don&#39;t get to know that, but when something looks wrong...it usually is
wrong). The alien ship stands like a great colossus between the rocks
of the horrid planet, and once inside, the unknown attacks. One crew
member is infected by what is called a &quot;face hugger&quot;. A creature with
acid instead of blood, with a great defensive system which spawns the
worst nightmare of Ellen Ripley.<br /><br />There will be scenes which will make you jump and tremble, and the
movie will keep you connected to the terrible events which happen on
the Nostromo.<br /><br />Alien exploits the fear of the unknown at its best, from the darkness
of space to the alien within poor Kane, from the intimacy of being lost
in space to the fear of mega-corporations, to claustrophobia, to
solitude, to betrayal. It&#39;s all here, all encapsulated in one of the
greatest films ever made. And such a world would not be complete
without the beast itself.<br /><br />All the things which relate to the evolution of the alien creature are
brilliantly thought of. It has more phases of evolution, some phases in
which it is truly vulnerable, yet it has the ability to survive, like
any animal. Evolved instincts, great strength and a beastly
intelligence...it could almost be something from our world. The fact
that makes it different is the capacity to kill with ease humans -
jolly! The most impressive thing about it is its looks: a fantastic
design coming from the bizarre mind of Hans Rudi Giger, inspired - as a
matter of fact - by his nightmares! <br /><br />Sigourney Weaver is the actress which will always be the symbol of
&quot;Alien&quot;. I guess it took you some time to guess that one right, didn&#39;t
it? Well, as always, the story of getting a classic role is filled with
near-misses and false impressions. But life has its way of making
things right, in such a manner that it always leaves you thinking: it
couldn&#39;t have been any other way. When it actually could have. <br /><br />Ridley Scott did a great job creating this universe with such a low
budget, and he deserves most of the applause. He created one of the
most terrific movies I have ever seen, with great horror scenes and
great filming. His love for details made Alien what it is today - a
huge mausoleum of horror, the wannabe result of any horror movie maker.
Sinful in several ways by todays standards - slowly paced and lacking
in terms of heavy action - Ridely Scott&#39;s film wins by defying them. A
master at work can always be recognized.
