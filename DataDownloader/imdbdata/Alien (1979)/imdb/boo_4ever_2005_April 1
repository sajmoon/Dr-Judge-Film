When watching this for the first time I think was the most scared I
have ever been in my life.<br /><br />Alien is just beyond masterpiece. It drips with homicidal genius from
each cell. It intrigues you and scares you in equal measure. You want
to find out more about this thing which haunts space yet at the same
time you're too scared to venture that far.<br /><br />Like a lot of the old classics Alien takes a while to set its scene.
Its about half way through the film that the alien finally starts its
attack. But its not boring. The atmosphere cuts through the your bone.
The lighting and music lull you into a constant state of dread. Even
when the coast seems clear you know that something isn't quite right.<br /><br />Purists will rate Alien as the best of the series. Personally I prefer
Camerons Aliens but there isn't much in it. The reason I like Aliens is
the all out war between the marines and the aliens. Its fine bumping
off a bunch of mechanics but lets see what this species can really
do....<br /><br />Alien is a haunted house film in space. If I'd known there were haunted
houses like that on earth Id never sleep again.
