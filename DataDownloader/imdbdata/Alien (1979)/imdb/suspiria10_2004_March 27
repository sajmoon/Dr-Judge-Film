Synopsis: 
The commercial starship Nostromo is on its' lengthy voyage back to Earth.
The seven crew members in stasis. A radio message is picked up by the ships
computer, but is it a greeting or an SOS. Things take a turn for the worse
when the crew investigates the signal and its; horrifying cause.<br /><br />Acting: 
The acting is all top notch. All the actors make the characters there own
with little nuances mannerisms. True some of the minor characters are a bit
underwritten but they hardly suffer. <br /><br />Direction / Writing: 
The direction and writing is spot on with a slant towards early filmmaking:
slow build up to kinetic end. Some other threads have said that the film has
no scares but I say that an atmosphere is created in the film with
punctuation by the occasional boo. <br /><br />Photography / Editing: 
Vanlint give the film a very claustrophobic feel at times that helps things
along. The production designers created one hell of a detailed ship that is
amazing in it's' detail. The editing is wonderful. It really shows off the
detail of the ship. <br /><br />Sex / Nudity: 
We are treated to a very sleek and sexy, totally bald @ssed creature, but
other than that don't get your hopes up. <br /><br />Sleaze: 
Here we got nothing either. Ripley in a t-shirt and panties is all you get
unless you count the sleazy science officer. <br /><br />Overall / Parting Remarks: 
I consider this SciFi / Horror hybrid to be a classic. A lot of good stuff
was put into this production to ensure its continued success. The film shows
its' age just a little with its' computer screens and ending explosion
though. Now for the new director's cut. I found it nice to see these added
scenes in the film. While not really necessary it does offer more for the
fans. Most of the scenes go seamlessly back into the film and neither adds
nor subtract anything major. The inclusion of the Dallas scene at the end
does kind of slow up the finale a bit but nothing major.<br /><br />
