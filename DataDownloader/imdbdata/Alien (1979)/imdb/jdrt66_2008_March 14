Without this move there would be no &quot;Aliens&quot;. <br /><br />Can you imagine?<br /><br />Everything everyone has stated before about how great and intense this
movie is, is entirely true. A pure work of genius from top to bottom.
Delicate yet lethal. A complete work of art that leaves you breathless.
What more do you want? A sequel? You got it! Aliens turns it on it&#39;s
head perfectly and sets a whole new standard. How many movies can you
say set an entire genre on it&#39;s head back to back? An incredible series
that will probably (should) go down as the best continuum ever. I can&#39;t
wait to see Alien: Quatro/Sinko...hehe<br /><br />God Bless Everyone of Us <br /><br />JD
