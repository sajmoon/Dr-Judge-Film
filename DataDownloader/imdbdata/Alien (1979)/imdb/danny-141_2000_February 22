there were many scary movies made in the seventies that today are considered
classics (e.g. Jaws, Halloween, Piranha, and ripoffs &amp; sequels).
Unfortunately i wasn't born in that decade, so i couldn't see anyone of
these movies, i've only seen them on the small screen. One of my favorite
movies of all time was Jaws, and i still think that that movie deserves the
title of &quot;best scary movie of the 70's&quot;. But, after lately seeing Alien,
which many people have told me was a good movie, i think it is a good
runner-up. I actually had seen Aliens, the sequel first, which was good.
Although, after seeing this one, that movie looks much worse. While Aliens
was okay, good, Alien is excellent, great! I know that many people think
exactly the opposite, but these people are definitely wrong. It also shows
because Alien is actually listed higher in the top 250. Alien was definitely
scarier, while Aliens is more of an action/war flick. It was also far too
loud and dumb and the action would often get boring. This never gets boring,
even if there are scenes where nothing happens. It has great music and
excellent set design, it really doesn't look old. <br /><br />I really understand why they call it a masterpiece!
