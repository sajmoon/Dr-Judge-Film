&quot;Get out of the room!&quot; <br /><br />Parker shouts this to Lambert in an intense moment. What does Lambert
do? Well, nothing. Between Ash's fascination, Ripley's hatred, Kane's
nonchalance, Brett's foolishness, Parker's stupidity, Dallas'
stubbornness, there is Lambert's... fear, or curiosity? <br /><br />Here is a film that does what it wants to do, and that is to scare.
Where most horror movies go wrong is when they let the unknown be
known. The thing that makes the title character, the Alien, so scary,
is not that it's an alien that has incredible ability. It's a
combination of ferocity in looks, peculiarity in style, and ultimately
the fact that no one knows what it does. It kills, but how? That no one
knows. But before someone thinks it wise to make a film where the
horror is completely unknown, read on.<br /><br />The genius of this film is not really keeping it a total secret. Ridley
Scott, in his first film, knew just how much to show. In the
Collector's Edition DVD, a director's cut of the film was included.
Among the special features was a deleted scene. While this scene helps
one understand the spectacular sequel, it would only overburden the
viewers with gore in the first film. Ridley Scott knew this was too
much, so he left us with tidbits of information as to how the Alien
killed.<br /><br />There have been many films that have followed this minimalistic
technique, and in many genres. What did Bill Murray whisper in &quot;Lost in
Translation,&quot; what was in the briefcase in &quot;Pulp Fiction,&quot; was the
defendant really innocent in &quot;12 Angry Men?&quot; The answer to all these is
decidedly unknown, and it was right not to let the answer be known.<br /><br />&quot;It is the question that brought you here. You know the question, just
as I did.&quot; This quote from &quot;The Matrix&quot; is, in my opinion, a summary of
the scene with Lambert as mentioned above. I believe that Neo and
Lambert are virtually the same character. They are both afraid, but at
the same time, they are curious as to the answer. What is it? Well, for
us, that would be a spoiler.
