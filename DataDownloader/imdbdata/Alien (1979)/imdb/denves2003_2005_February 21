One of the creepiest sci-fi movies of all time. It combines sci-fi with
horror with director Ridley Scott building the tension slowly. In fact,
some people have complained that it moves too slowly, especially in
contrast to the sequel (Aliens 1982) but this critics fail to
appreciate the terrifying build-up to a spectacular climax between
Ripley &amp; the Alien.<br /><br />The cast works well with one another and even though it is sci-fi it
becomes believable as the movie progresses. This movie should be in
every sci-fi &amp; horror fan's collection (along with the sequel). I just
wish that I had seen it originally on the big screen, but in 1979 I had
my head elsewhere.
