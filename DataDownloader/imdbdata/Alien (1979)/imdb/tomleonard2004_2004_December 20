Alien is just brilliant, original and breath taking its a shame Alien 3
and Alien resurrection were just too predictable and are a total let
down, in the famous chest bursting scene, they actually didn't tell the
actors what was going to happen for the extra surprise.<br /><br />Through out the film the crew eventually get devoured one by one,
until only one person is left, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) who manages
to destroy the alien and The Nostromo(Self Destructs) by ejecting it
out of the air lock.<br /><br />The ship Nostromo receives a distress call they cant ignore, but find
out its not a distress call but a warning.In Space No One Can Hear You
