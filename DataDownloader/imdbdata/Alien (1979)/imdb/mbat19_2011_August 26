The trailer from Alien let you know you weren&#x27;t in Kansas anymore: In
space, no one can hear you scream.&#x22; Released on year after Star Wars,
Alien became the antithesis of the blockbuster film. While Star Wars,
emphasized good versus evil with the good guys winning, Alien brooded
darkness and claustrophobia. <br /><br />When the crew of the ship Nostromo receives a distant signal they go to
investigate, but the signal turns out to be a SOS. When they get there
they are slowly systematically and individually attacked and killed by
an unknown force. The first time we see the alien up close is in a
shocking scene, now a classic that lets the viewer know you are in for
one hell of a ride, so sit back. <br /><br />The difference in space movies in one year is quite a thing to see.
With influences from the thing, Alien plays on our isolation,
loneliness and claustrophobia. Much of the film is set in darkness and
tight spaces. Then the attack comes, most of the time unseen and only
briefly heard. Quite the thing when sitting in a darkened, enclosed
theater.<br /><br />Director James Cameron, later of Titanic fame, takes these human
weaknesses and fears and makes you sit in a theater for 2 hours and
want more.
