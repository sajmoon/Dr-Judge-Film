Alien is a film that will forever go down in history. It has earned a
place among the greatest horror movies of all time and was put there by
the fans. I know people who have seen this film literally dozens of
times and are scared by it each time. The first time I saw Alien I was
four years old... and it put me to sleep in a manner of minutes. Till
this day it still accomplishes that.<br /><br />I have seen Alien 5 times. Each time I struggle to stay awake. I find
this film so incredibly boring &amp; dull. I understand why so many people
find this film scary. When they tell me why they were scared I don't
think &quot;What the hell is the matter with these people?&quot;. Yet the formula
seems to be scared by does not work on me.<br /><br />Much like AVP, the films lacks what the title promises. You barely see
the Alien. I know most people credit that to the films horror, but for
me I find it incredibly annoying and frustrating. When I go to a movie
called Alien I want to see an Alien! Overall the title character gets
only about 30 seconds of screen time. When the film was done I couldn't
even describe what the creature looked like. The least they could have
done is give the Alien enough screen time so the audience could
actually KNOW what it looked like.<br /><br />Ridley Scott pretty much invented the formula of hiding the monster and
using the characters to sell the fear. The problem is he over used it.
He used way too much characters and way too little Alien. There needs
to be a perfect balance between the two like James Cameron did with
Aliens. He hid the Aliens till half-way through the movie but at least
he gave us long enough looks at the Aliens that we had a perfect
picture of what it looked like.<br /><br />Alien is another one of those films that has earned a place in cinema
history. But yet I have never been caught up in the terror so many
people claim it has.
