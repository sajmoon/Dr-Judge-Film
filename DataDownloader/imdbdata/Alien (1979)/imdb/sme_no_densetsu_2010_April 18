Ridley Scott&#x27;s &#x22;Alien&#x22; can be counted among the most influential
science fiction films of all time. Taking cues from earlier landmarks
like &#x22;The Thing From Another World&#x22;, &#x22;2001: A Space Odyssey&#x22; and &#x22;Star
Wars&#x22;, Scott created an atmospheric thriller capitalizing on the
isolation of space. Thirty years and several sequels later the film
remains impressive.<br /><br />The story concerns a mining ship crew on their return to earth who
investigate a possible S.O.S. on a remote planet. They stumble upon
alien life forms and circumstances dictate bringing one aboard the
ship. Little do they know that they&#x27;ve invited a highly dangerous
extraterrestrial into their midst.<br /><br />The cast is small but well-assembled. Sigourney Weaver gets most of the
attention but there&#x27;s also excellent work from John Hurt &#x26; Ian Holm,
among others.<br /><br />Scott&#x27;s direction is impressive and often methodical while not allowing
the film&#x27;s pace to suffer. The cinematography is routinely attractive
and really shows off the excellent, Oscar-nominated art direction. The
Oscar-winning special effects may be a bit rudimentary by today&#x27;s
standards but they are still convincing for the most part. Musically,
Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s score is alright but I think that the film could&#x27;ve
used something a bit more avant-garde.<br /><br />Ultimately, &#x22;Alien&#x22; is an important science fiction film whose
influence is still being felt today. Even non-science fiction fans
should be able to appreciate the film as a high concept thriller.
