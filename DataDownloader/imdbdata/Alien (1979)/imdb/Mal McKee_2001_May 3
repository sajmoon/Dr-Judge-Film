OK, so sound doesn't travel well in a vacuum, yet we still hear the sound of
the ship's engines in space.  But what the hey!  Ridley Scott had realism in
his mind when he made this classic - 99% of the gadgets in the film actually
worked.  The cast is second to none, and proved that using a mix of British
and American actors was the way to go.  His almost fly-on-the-wall approach
paid off so well in setting up the characters.  Suspicion and suspense were
the keys; the mystery of the alien; the quirkiness of Ian Holm's acting.  I
first watched this film at the tender age of 10, on a friend's aunt's pirate
video (she was one of the first people in our area to have a VCR!), around
1980.  And it scared the hell out of me!  Again, this film is superior to
its great sequels.  But it shouldn't really be compared, having a style all
its own.  Compared to more recent horror films, it may not have the same
impact.  If you haven't seen this film, rent it, turn the lights off, start
the film, and feel the tension.
