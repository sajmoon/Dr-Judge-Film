Ridley Scott directed a winner here. I don&#39;t need to list all the
awards this film won and was considered for; let&#39;s just say it was a
sh*tload.<br /><br />I have never been a sci-fi buff, but I was attached like glue to this
film from start to finish. The horror was minimal, but the suspense was
incredible.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver was everything I was expecting. She was just
incredible and made this film worth watching.<br /><br />Tom Skerritt was the jerk that I expected him to be. He did not
disappoint.<br /><br />There was a great supporting cast and this film is a must for all
suspense buffs.
