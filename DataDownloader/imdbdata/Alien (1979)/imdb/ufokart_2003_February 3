i must start saying that this is ridley scott's best movie, i consider
that
all the other films he made are completely rrubish. anyway, this movie is
an
exception in his career, this film is rather good. at this point you shoul
all know the plot so i'm not going to talk about it i'll only say that it
was a very good plot that fell into scott's hands and it became an ok
plot,
what a waste. cast is good, with high performances of ian holm and yaphet
kotto. the best things of the film without a doubt are the alien creature
(which is horryfying) and the atsmosphere of the film (dark and foggy).
the
picture has some memorable scenes like when harry dean stanton is killed
and
when we learn ian holm is a robot. but without a doubt, the best scene is
when the alien pops out of one of the guy's belly, that is frightening.<br /><br />regretably some spookie moments and an excellent atsmosphere arn't enough
for an outstanding movie, but with no doubt is the best in the series
(however i still have to watch &quot;alien 2&quot; a.k.a &quot;aliens&quot;). I don't rate
this
movie with a five because i feel pitty of ridley scott.
6/10.
