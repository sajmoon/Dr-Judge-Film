&quot;Alien&quot; is a dark tour of suspense and terror which grabs ahold of the
viewer,wrapping that viewer with elements of simplifying atmosphere of
sci-fi terror.It&#39;s a film that has elements of darkness,making us feel
vulnerable at times.The highpoint of this film is that it still stands
towering above it&#39;s three sequels and it&#39;s imitators.I enjoyed all four
&quot;Alien&quot; films. What makes this film such a classic is the way director
Ridley Scott puts characters into certain situations that makes us feel
vulnerable.The trailer for the film,the narrator says,&quot;In space,no one
can hear you scream&quot;.Ridley Scott reminds us that we are really in
space and that in space there is no escape from terror.&quot;Alien&quot; is the
kind of sci-fi,horror film that set the standard for films today
like&quot;Event Horizon&quot;,although that was a supernatural film,it was still
set on a spaceship.This film is a truly a classic for it&#39;s kind and the
visual effects are tremendously spectacular.&quot;Alien&quot; is the real classic
of sci-fi horror films.
