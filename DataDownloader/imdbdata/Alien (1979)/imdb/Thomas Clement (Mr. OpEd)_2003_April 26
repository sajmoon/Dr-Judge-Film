In space, no one can hear you yawn.<br /><br />The first Ridley Scott film I saw was The Duelists. LOVED it! So I had
high
hopes for Alien. I saw it when it came out in 1979. Admittedly, the film
had
a disadvantage before the credits rolled: I saw it in Hollywood and the
line
for the film was far scarier than the film could possibly
be.<br /><br />As I sat watching it, it seemed familiar, like a film that really freaked
me
out as a boy: It! The Terror from Beyond Space. ITTFBS had a monster that
just couldn't be killed and it was on a ship in space so there was NO
escaping it (none of these fruity escape pods in 50s sci-fi). I haven't
seen
ITTFBS since, but it ranked right up there with Mars Attacks bubble gum
cards for giving me the creeps.<br /><br />So Alien was a remake. There's no crime against that, unless it ends up
being the film Alien turned out to be: not very scary, pretty funny (for
the
wrong reasons) in spots, and politically correct (the enemy isn't so much
the Alien as BIG BUSINESS that wants the Alien brought back no matter what
the cost). I haven't seen the complete film again for several years, but
as
it was on today and I found so many parts so ludicrous, I had to
vent.<br /><br />First, a plus: the sequence leading up to the face hugger eggs was, if
sluggish, rather intriguing (why do space-age cameras of the future take
such bad pictures?) and the sets were great! But we are introduced early
on
to the film's unending and uninteresting mumbled dialog. I guess this was
supposed to make the film seem more `real.' They were improvising some of
this, but it might as well have been `caterpillar watermelon' crowd-scene
improvising. This got old fast.<br /><br />The stomach bursting was a shock! But that quickly faded as the Alienette
looks like little more than a nasty finger puppet and literally zips off
screen WB-cartoon style. It gets worse. After a fight to the death
involving
a rolled-up issue of Evil Android Monthly, Ash's head comes off. A few
minutes of poking a prosthetic mock-up of Ash's head which looks NOTHING
like the actual Ash, there is a clumsy cut to actor Holm's head poking
through a hole in a table. Meant to be gory and gruseome, this is all just
inept. And the gurgle/burble white ooze everywhere made me chuckle -- it
looked like someone was having a Dairy Queen nightmare.<br /><br />Before Ash, the only enunciator in the bunch, is sent to that big milk
carton in the sky, he tells us the Alien can't be killed and that the crew
is expendable. Daft! How can one transport something that can't be killed
which, if it decides it wants to kill you (and everybody else, which seems
to be its &quot;thing&quot;),  can't be transported? Well, that's just the way those
big, evil corporations work, I guess. I'll bet the same people behind
Wendy's and Swatch are planning something just like this right now! In
space, nothing makes much sense!<br /><br />And speaking of that tag line, I had hoped that this would be a scary,
`real' tech movie, following in the footsteps of 2001. No. Sadly, in
space,
everyone can hear you scream, and mumble, and just make a TON of noise
(especially Lambert and Parker throwing those cylinders around; they were
probably killed because the Alien couldn't sleep!). And when did steam
become a high-tech necessity. Is it DRY in space and they need a nuclear
humidifier on every deck; a leaky one, at that?<br /><br />The last ten minutes are fairly tense: will Ripley slip into something
even
more comfortable than skin-tight t-shirt and panties before confronting
the
Alien which is no longer fast and dangerous in the confines of the escape
pod, but stumbles around in the ubiquitous steam until it can be ejected
like a drunk who's stayed past closing time?<br /><br />There. I feel better now.
