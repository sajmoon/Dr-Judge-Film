Three words perfectly describe ALIEN: Long, dark and ominous.<br /><br />You know you're in for a good time when even the opening title gives
you a shiver. The music plays perfectly as the word 'ALIEN' slowly
appears, line by line. Then there are the establishing shots of the
ship; poorly maintained, claustrophobic.<br /><br />And then there's basically forty minutes of people in a ship pondering
and eating and getting along (or not). The film has one little thing
that allows it to draw you along so slowly - a promise. A promise made
by the advertisements and hype that this was going to kick your ass.
You just had to wait.<br /><br />But when it happens, it happens. Though the film doesn't speed up per
se, there's a lot more happening in front of the screen to make it at
least look like stuff's going on. The first half crawls almost
depressingly, but the second half catches your eye and refuses to let
go.<br /><br />I suggest everyone sees this film. Even if you skip through the
beginning, you need to see this. It defined sci-fi and horror all in
one.<br /><br />It's perfect.
