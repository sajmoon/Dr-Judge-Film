I decided to see Alien because I heard it was the best sci-fi alien movie
ever. Unfortunatly, I didn't find it as good as it was said. It was very
slow, a little confusing, and not scary at all (at least on my terms) I
don't see many scary movies but this one had nothing for me. No suspense,
not much action. The scenes went very very very very slow. To me, it wasn't
the best sci-fi movie ever. Maybe I'm just spoiled by the movies
now...
