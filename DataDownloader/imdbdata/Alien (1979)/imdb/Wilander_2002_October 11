I read a review of this, which said it was dull, overrated and basically
awful. The reviewer preferred &quot;Aliens&quot;. This is a classic example of the
bland film tastes of many, (mainly American and British), audiences today.
This is a movie which redefined terror, that pushed the limits of set
design, that wasn't afraid to make you feel physically ill, at times. We
all
know the plot by now, (rusty spaceship is summoned to help an abandoned
planet, picks up an unwanted alien passenger, and the rest of the plot
concerns the crews attempts to escape from it), which makes it both
accessible and yet unknowable, expected yet still fresh. If you want a
dumb,
P.C, &quot;Oh look, we're being post-modern aren't we clever?&quot; movie, then
watch
most of what Hollywood's produced in the past decade. If you want
something
of quality and substance, watch this. And it was made by an English
director! YES!!!
