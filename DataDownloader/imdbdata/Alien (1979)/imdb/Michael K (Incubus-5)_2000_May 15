If you have not seen this one yet, stop reading these User Comments and go
rent it. I'm sure by now you have heard, or possibly read, plenty of
people's opinions regarding this movie and don't need any more. Its worth
watching several times. Its action, its Sci-Fi, its horror, its drama. All
rolled up in one compact little package. I saw it on DVD recently and there
are some excellent Special Features including deleted scenes and director's
comments. Ridley Scot had a real winner here.
