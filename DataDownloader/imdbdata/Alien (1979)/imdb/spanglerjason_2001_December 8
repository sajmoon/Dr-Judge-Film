I remember the first time i saw this film, I was 5 years old. I watched it
late at night, alone, and let me tell you I STILL have nightmares. This
film
is a masterpiece of sci-fi horror. This film is probably the scariest movie
ever made, but that can be debated. If you've never seen this movie, rent
it, watch it alone, in the dark, I garantee you will be AFRAID.
