Alien may be looking a bit dated nowadays, what with it's chugging computers
and hilariuosly outdated monitor screens, but it still captures you with its suspence. The long periods searching the ship for the Alien slows your
heartbeat to the rate of the ship's whirring thuds. Despite the fact that a
couple of girls i am unfortunately aquainted with ruined it for me forever 
(calling the alien cute as it bursts from John H's body as well as
continually giggleing at the insult &quot;you look dead&quot; and line &quot;I'm going
down too&quot;) i still believe it is a modern (or not so) classic.
