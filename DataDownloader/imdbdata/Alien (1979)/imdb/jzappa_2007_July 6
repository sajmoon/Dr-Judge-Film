Ridley Scott opens Alien in a completely foreign atmosphere, with
detailed images and objects that we&#x27;ve never seen and detailed sound
effects that we&#x27;ve never heard. The camera moves around slowly and
quietly, exploring this place, and it makes us want to be there. This
is how he elusively draws us in and begins building suspense right
under our noses. The commercial spaceship, the distance it is away from
earth that&#x27;s impossible in this age and surely for another several
decades, the planet the characters land on, and practically every means
of doing ordinary things are all, well, alien to us, and we cannot help
but feel bewildered and tense. The scenes of suspense are some of the
most powerful I have ever seen. You cannot watch certain scenes in this
film without being caused to jump. Ridley Scott is such a cognizant and
clear-minded director that he has built the entire film around the
seemingly incidental effects it has on us.<br /><br />The story is original, and somehow very naturally disturbing. Everyone
is away from home, everyone has a lifestyle that doesn&#x27;t even exist in
the present-day reality, the science-fiction creations are all twisted
imaginings. The plot hardly takes any turns. It&#x27;s actually rather
simple, and yet every scene is unpredictable, the writing is truly
scary, and literally everything is done right, right down to the
handling of the character of Jonesy, the cat.<br /><br />The creature itself is a disturbing, vivid creation. I mean, have you
ever thought about how odd this thing is? It looks almost like a
Frankenstein&#x27;s monster of machinery and mechanical parts. When it is
first seen, we hardly even realize that we&#x27;ve seen it. That is how
scary this movie is.
