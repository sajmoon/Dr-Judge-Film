A movie like &quot;Alien&quot; comes once in a blue moon. It takes immense talent
to make a creature flick and pull it off beautifully. Rarely are there
any creature movies which don't have cheap, laughable effects or
n-number of plot holes! &quot;Alien&quot; succeeds where countless other
&quot;inspirations&quot; fail! &quot;Alien&quot; tells the story of a crew of 7 returning
to earth in a mining ship Nostromo. They intercept a signal, possibly
an S.O.S. from a distant planet and go on to investigate. What follows
is a deadly journey of terror like never before.<br /><br />&quot;Alien&quot; has got some of the finest creature effects for the time 1979!
The face-hugger and the scenes involving the face-hugger carry such
shock value; it is surprising that the film-makers from later years who
resort to cheap thrills in movies, haven't even been able to get close
to showing anything to this effect! It is amazing how they have managed
to make these effects look so good. The director is intelligent. He
makes sure that the creature is never shown in its entirety. This trick
works like magic, and it looks so real; thus, not for one moment does
it seem as if there is a dummy running around in an Alien costume!
Another selling point of &quot;Alien&quot; is the nail-biting suspense! The
creature appears on screen for a minimal time, but the director makes
sure the presence of the creature lurking around in the corners is
felt! The set of the space-ship is so real, its scary! Kudos to the
Production designers and set decorators.<br /><br />Likewise, the lighting within the ship; it gives an authentic touch to
the set and adds to the thrill-effects.<br /><br />The sound effects are wonderful and very convincing! In summary, almost
everything on the technical front deserves an A grade.<br /><br />Now, the actors: All the characters are fully developed, and each one
carries equal importance. That is very important in a movie that shows
the involvement of a lot of characters. These characters are
brilliantly portrayed by all of the actors involved: Sigourney Weaver,
Tom Skerritt, John Hurt, Harry Dean Stanton; special mention of Ian
Holm, Yaphet Kotto and Veronica Cartwright. It is difficult to pick out
any single performance as unconvincing. Everyone has done a fantastic
job.<br /><br />This is Ridley Scott's masterpiece. &quot;Alien&quot; will remain a landmark film
in the Sci-fi-Horror-creature movies, and will always remain way on top
of all other cheap imitations from the same genre.
