I was ten when I first saw this. It was amazing.
I'd been pestering my dad to let me watch it after I got hooked on the
comics. Then i saw it.<br /><br />Being ten, I thought it was slow until the chestburster came. I remember
saying &quot;Can we rewind that?&quot;
The first time you see the Alien is supurb. A slick head with a
detailed
mouth of tendons. I jumped up to try and get a closer look.<br /><br />Then the movie really started. The Alien pops up suddenly and it takes
you a
while to get over it. When you see Ash we jumped even though we knew he
was
there.<br /><br />Even though I'd read the &quot;Making of&quot; book (Dissecting Aliens: Terror
in
Space), I thought it was over when Ripley got into the shuttle. Then
after a
few minutes of watching it was over.<br /><br />If you haven't already seen it, you're missing out on one of the best
films ever.
