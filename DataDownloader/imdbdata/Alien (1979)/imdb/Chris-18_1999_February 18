Ridley Scott's Alien is a truly horrifying horror/sci-fi film that really
brought that genre back to life of 50's alien movies.  The music,
cinematography and sets are astounding. Most of the performances are
mediocre with the obvious exception of Sigourney Weaver, although Ian Holm
is interesting.  There are several extremely scary sequences in this film,
one of the more brilliantly staged ones being Tom Skeritt's hunt for the
alien in one of the air shafts.  It is truly terrifying.  This film does
have its flaws however.  The small bit of nudity at the end is totally
ridiculous and really makes the power of the film drop at the end.  And some
of the dialouge isn't that good.  But overall a great movie.  And the music
is incredibly scary...especially during the opening credits.  It sets you up
for the terror that is soon to follow!
