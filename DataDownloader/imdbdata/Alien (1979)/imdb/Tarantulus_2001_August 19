Alien was the start of a new genre of science fiction flicks. In that
respect, it stands out.It also gave birth to a series that has become
somewhat iconic in the movie viewing community.
I am however baffled by the awe, admiration and high praise given to the
first Alien movie.<br /><br />The concept of space horror was not new in 1979, however the expression of
that concept in Alien was unique, revolutionary.
The landscape and scenery were fantastic and the monsters (Alien) were
incredibly designed for maximum terror impact.<br /><br />Now did anyone notice that the storyline itself was ridiculous?
Much of the trouble these intrepid travelers got themselves into was a
result of idiotic decisions not explained by motivations of greed, duty,
loyalty or what have you.<br /><br />To create suspense the crew were made to take the kind of stupid,
incautious
actions that is typical of B-grade horror flicks.<br /><br />1)Gung-ho and headlong exploration of unchartered and potentially dangerous
territory without proper surveillance with available technology.<br /><br />2)Introduction of the threat to the colony by inane decisions that are
unlikely to occur in real life.<br /><br />3)Exposure to the threat without adequate protection during experimentation
and study.<br /><br />4)No such thing as quarantine to people exposed to a strange
phenomenon<br /><br />5)The classic, lets separate to fight the foe, so we can get picked off one
by one.<br /><br />And the list goes on and on.<br /><br />Quite a lot of Hollywood types are school dropouts, and it reflects in some
of the junk that is pumped out of the mill - costing millions.
Those that are smart are often compelled by coercion or greed to cater to
the lowest common denominator.<br /><br />Final analysis: This expression of the space horror genre was
revolutionary.
The special effects,and technology driven aspects were a
masterpiece.
The storyline was ridiculous, totally implausible, even for
science fiction
