Alien truly is a landmark film. It had excellent direction, acting, set
design, and special effects.<br /><br />What most new viewers don't realize ( Like those who saw Aliens first)is
that the Alien motion picture was originally a horror/suspense film, not a
sci-fi action film. This movie was not meant to show guns blazing or
people
getting murdered every 5 seconds.<br /><br />This film is about the terror of being preyed upon by a monster that is
unstoppable. For those who say nothing happens, that's because the mystery
and suspense of the alien creature was wasted when you saw one of the
other
alien movies, which spoil this mood. The director set a creepy, dark,
suspenseful mood with the help of art director H.R. Giger, then let loose
a
very creative looking alien. What made this film so scary was that we did
not see the entire alien. When it shows up we get just enough of a glimpse
to make us fear it. This great craft was wasted in the sequel, where the
alien just becomes another villain in the mountain of other alien monsters
out there.<br /><br />Overall, THE best science-fiction horror film for those with enough wits
to
realize the suspense and originality of it all.<br /><br />
