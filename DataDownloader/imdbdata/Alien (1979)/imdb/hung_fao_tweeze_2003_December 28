There are so many reasons to love this movie. I saw it on the big screen
back in '79 and was in awe. This movie doesn't even attempt to meet you with
explanations for every squeak, squawk, or line uttered unintelligibly. It
remains mysterious and tense throughout. You never even get a really clear
look at the creature (a la 'The Thing From Another World'). On the other
hand you don't feel disappointed that you never get a clear look. The
tension, anxiety and claustrophobia settles right into your gut and stays
throughout the pic thus satisfying what you originally came to the movie for
in the first place. Giger's creature is art and apparently began a whole
industry of look-a-likes. But this is the original and best in my book. I
thought the sequels were great as well but Scott's direction conveys an
oppressive atmosphere not present in the sequels. This puts it at a certain
pinnacle the others didn't quite reach. Let's run through the accolades -
shall we? The acting is top-notch and quite believable. The sound track - or
frequent lack thereof - maintains the dread very adequately. The special
effects are still good. The camera work is precise in every scene. And the
pacing never lets up. You worry about what's around the corner with every
scene. A neat little gem that belongs in every sci-fi/horror library. Very
worthy of multiple viewings.
