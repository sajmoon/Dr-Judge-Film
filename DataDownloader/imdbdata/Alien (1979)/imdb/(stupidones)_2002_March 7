Genre levels blur here in Alien.  Everything from the creature to the ship
is just plain creepy and no other movie can imitate Alien (not even the
other Alien movies.)  They should have stopped after Aliens (Aliens 3 was a
joke, not to mention Resurrection.)  I was surprised to jump at a point in
the movie, and I'm 20 years old!
