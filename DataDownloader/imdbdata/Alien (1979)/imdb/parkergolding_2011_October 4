Alien is a most difficult film to define. In one sense it&#x27;s a sci-fi
film, in another it&#x27;s a Gothic horror film. Ridley Scott&#x27;s vision of
the future was so intriguing at the time due to its modest
implications. The usual sense of humans as infinitesimal in contrast
with their universe is there, as is the feeling that one could be
engulfed without incident. But for all its cosmic commonalities; Alien
is grounded in a sense of realism. This is indicated by the Nostromo, a
space Junker operated by eight ragtag crewman, which is a remnant of
heavy industry and mass production that is void of the futuristic sheen
of fictionalised ships such as the Enterprise, or the Millennium
Falcon. Moreover, the crew is representative of the working
middle-class; a humble collection of eight crewman whose expertise lies
within the most basic provisions of engineering, spare two scientists,
these people are the everyday collection that make up our society.
Which is why Alien is an exemplary horror film: it deals with ordinary
people under extraordinary circumstances &#x96; its sci-fi trappings
notwithstanding. <br /><br />Like John Carpenter&#x27;s minimalist horror film The Thing; Alien is a
subtle exercise in tension punctuated by moments of absolute horror. It
deals with the venereal and psychological elements of its characters.
The Alien is seldom seen, akin to the shark in Jaws, but its presence
is always felt. The horror is engendered by its characters rank
paranoia, which in turn instils the audience with the same kind of
impending dread. The emphasis on the venereal works exceptionally well
because it triggers our most basic patterns of instinct and fear. Alien
has a distinctly European quality in that it unfolds through the
composition of stillness and music. Dialogue is certainly present;
however there is an ethereal quality to the proceedings evoking images
and sounds that are both chilling and resonant. This is why Alien is
such a superior genre film: it takes well established ideas and
endeavours into new territory with them.<br /><br />Ultimately, Alien is a &#x22;B-film&#x22; just as Jaws and the Fly are, but in
compounding the formulaic elements with fresh ideas it elevates itself
not from its roots, but from people&#x27;s preconceived views on the genre&#x27;s
limitations. This is particularly apparent in subverting the
male-centric heroics in favour of its female lead: Ripley &#x96; played with
much sincerity and poise by Sigourney Weaver. In fact Ridley Scott
discards the film&#x27;s potentially masculine element so curtly and with
such cold precision that he can only really be praised for it. As for
the creature itself, Scott was loath to consider having his monster
being anything other than terrifying. In defining the aesthetics of the
Alien, it is best described as an immensely intimidating figure with a
phallic head coupled with a retractable secondary mouth that operates
like a dagger coated in translucent goo. But what&#x27;s more significant is
the form it takes. The alien mutates and evolves much like a virus
throughout the film and is all the more horrifying for it. Perhaps this
was intentional on Scott&#x27;s part to contrast the perpetually latent
paranoia of the characters with the burgeoning senses of the Alien. In
any event the Nostromo functions as a proxy for fear and instinct. <br /><br />The greatest virtue of Alien is the sense of sheer terror it invokes,
whether it is through the lens of the cosmos, or in the claustrophobic
confines of a spaceship. Like all great films, Alien remains a
remarkable achievement and cinematic landmark as it engages the senses
and invites discussion from the casual and ardent film goer.
