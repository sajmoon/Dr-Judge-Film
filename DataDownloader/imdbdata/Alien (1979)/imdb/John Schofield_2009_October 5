This film was made thirty years ago and it is testament to its quality
that it still stands the closest of scrutiny. This is because in my
mind it is flawless. I remember clearly watching this film for the
first time and being enjoyably scared and completely captivated by the
events as they unfolded. The persons imagination which dreamed up the
alien or maybe dreamed isn&#x27;t the right word is to be applauded for his
or her inventiveness. In fact all of the people involved in this film
should be thanked and rightfully very proud of their combined work. As
in all great films the feel of this film is just right in every
respect, you know you will see an alien but you do not know when or how
and the build up to that event is so well done and most people should
be able to identify with one or more of the people on the Nostromo and
how they react to the threat. The film is high in the IMDb charts but
maybe not high enough but that may change over time. The film is a
classic science fiction, horror product and for the first time watcher
please just relax and take everything in. Alien lasts for a shade under
two hours and is atmospheric from the first second to the last.
