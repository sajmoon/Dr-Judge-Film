&quot;Alien&quot; ranks as one of the finest sci-fi movies ever made. One thing that
makes this movie so unique, especially for its time, was that it combined
elements of science fiction and horror. The spaceship, the outer-space
setting and the alien itself (designed by H.R. Geiger) are the sci-fi
elements. But when you get down to it, &quot;Alien&quot; is more of a horror movie,
only with a spaceship instead of a haunted house and an alien instead of a
monster. The claustrophobic setting and the dark corridors provide the right
atmosphere for this movie.<br /><br />The movie is wonderfully directed by Ridley Scott. The same man who would
give us another sci-fi classic, &quot;Blade Runner,&quot; three years later. The
special effects are impressive, especially for 1979. The pacing is handled
very well, subtle in just the right moments and chaotic in just the right
moments. The score by Jerry Goldsmith is wonderful. The only real flaw in
the film is that it gets a little slow at times. Minor complaint
though.<br /><br />To see sci-fi cinema at its best, check out this movie and the excellent
sequel that followed, &quot;Aliens.&quot;
