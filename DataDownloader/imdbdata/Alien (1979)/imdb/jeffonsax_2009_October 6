You must have seen this movie by now. If you haven&#x27;t then why not. this
is one of those films that must be seen and will always be part of our
film history.<br /><br />I like it because of the way it is shot. It is claustrophobic, the
scenes in the general parts of the spaceship give a feeling that these
people are living on top of each other and that creates stress and
tension.<br /><br />The lighting is cold, fluorescent and sometimes over dazzling. this
also creates a feeling of high anxiety.<br /><br />add to this the Alien, a double crossing robot and a ship that is about
to blow up and you have great film.
