&#x22;In space, no one can hear you scream&#x22; <br /><br />What I would have given to be around when this first came out. I could
just imagine the impact that this movie would have had on the people of
the late 1970&#x27;s. Because &#x27;Alien&#x27; was a completely fresh idea at that
time, no one had ever seen anything like it before, and that&#x27;s probably
one of the big reasons why it became such a success, both publicly and
critically.<br /><br />In &#x27;Alien&#x27; we encounter a small crew of 7 humans on-board the huge
space ship of the &#x27;Nostromo&#x27;, they are interrupted on their journey
back to earth by a transmission from a unknown world. They go to
investigate and come across a foreign ship wreck where they come into
contact with the alien life-form that will seal their doom.<br /><br />One of the things that made this story work out so well was the setting
inside the space ship. The spaceship in itself plays a big role in
creating the feel and suspense of the movie. The director puts you in
this maze of long halls and enclosed corridors, so that when the Alien
gets on-board it creates this amazingly tense atmosphere of
claustrophobia, which also employs a dread of not being able to escape
the terror that crawls through insides of the ship. You may wonder why
they can&#x27;t just kill the Alien and get it over with, but see that&#x27;s
another great thing about the setting of the movie, you can&#x27;t kill it,
because this organism has a unique defence mechanism, acid blood. If
you take a blaster to this animal, then it&#x27;s highly acidic blood will
eat through the halt of the ship, sucking every life including the
crew&#x27;s into the dark infinite of space. <br /><br />&#x27;Alien&#x27; is an incredibly well-thought through, well constructed movie.
There is not a single flaw, not a single spit of doubt or questioning
in this movie, completely one-hundred percent solid.<br /><br />The Ridley Scott direction is pitch-perfect. You couldn&#x27;t choose a
better person to shoot this movie. He incorporates an equal complexion
of sound and visuals with intelligent usage of lighting and camera
angles while creating a very realistic look into a far-off futuristic
world.<br /><br />The acting is splendid, the characters are just like us, ordinary
people with strengths and weaknesses, which allows you to connect with
them and feel for their fears and losses.<br /><br />H. R. Giger&#x27;s Gothic artistry and scenery design is just as scary as
the alien, maybe that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s hard to tell the difference
between the two. The creature itself is pure genius. A ruthless,
soul-less monster with no higher intentions than to continue with the
next stage of it&#x27;s life cycle. It has no facial characteristics, not
even eyes, which I think is awesome because you can&#x27;t see where it&#x27;s
looking or what it&#x27;s thinking and how scary is that? <br /><br />The mere title of Alien describes the movie perfectly. It&#x27;s a noun, and
an adjective, it&#x27;s the feel and the theme of the movie.<br /><br />Alien is a flawless masterpiece, an absolute triumph in the film making
community. It has all the qualities of a perfect film. A great script,
great production values, great acting and great directing. A GREAT
MOVIE!
