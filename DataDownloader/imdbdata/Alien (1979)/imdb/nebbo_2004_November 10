2004_November 10 
I couldn't not comment on this film in response to MovieCritic2003, who
seems to dislike &quot;Alien&quot; because it is not &quot;Aliens&quot;. Different
director, different plot, different tone, different characters,
different scenario. Even at the tender age of 17, when I first saw
&quot;Alien&quot; (btw the scariest film I had ever seen up to that point), I
recognized it as a classic horror/suspense/Gothic story, albeit in a
sci-fi setting. Ridley Scott is a genius for creating atmosphere, and
&quot;Alien&quot; succeeds at many levels. These are &quot;regular folks&quot; dealing with
something completely beyond their experience. They are &quot;merchant
mariners&quot; and miners, and they respond accordingly. It's silly to
compare them to the hardened Colonial Marines from the sequel.
