This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen.  The acting was horrendous,
and the plot was as bad or worse than Daylight, the terrible movie starring
Sylvester (the guy from Rocky).  The movie was so bad that I actually CRIED.
 The part where the pregnant girl falls down the stairs is the only positive
part of the movie.  I actually laughed when that happened.  Brittany Spears
is a HORRIBLE actress.
