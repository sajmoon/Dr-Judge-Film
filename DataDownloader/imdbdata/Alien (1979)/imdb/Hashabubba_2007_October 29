Not only is Alien a great film, it is was a huge influence to future
Si-Fi television and cinema. Before Alien came out the idea of a
&quot;spaceship&quot; was a very clean and shiny, luxurious hotel in space.
However that was all to change, because Ridley Scott&#39;s vision of a
&quot;haunted house in space&quot; changed the way we see spaceships forever. It
also gives a great atmosphere and look to the film; which is very
important when making a horror movie. <br /><br />It is truly spine tingling, and a great artistic achievement on every
level. The design for the creature itself is genius. And the way it is
always hidden in the shadows, so don&#39;t see it, makes your imagination
fill in the gaps. And that is something that is scarier than any horror
film you&#39;ll see in your life time.<br /><br />The whole look and feel to the film is brilliant. It creates a dark,
uneasy atmosphere, and Ridley Scott doesn&#39;t give us an easy way out.
