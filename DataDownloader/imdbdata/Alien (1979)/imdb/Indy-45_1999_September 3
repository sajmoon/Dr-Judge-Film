1999_September 3 

this movie was terrible, simply terrible! It was absolute torture to look
at: people say it's scary, but i call it disgusting. Also, the film didn't
have a plot! It was just about an alien that sneaks into a spacecraft and
haunts people: seen it! Those persons in that shuttle didn't look like
astronauts at all: they just looked like they were in the wrong spot. The
film was incredibly boring, too: and when it started &quot;moving along&quot; it just
was all about gore and slime in stomach-torturing scenes . Now that's not
what i call &quot;scary&quot;. This movie doesn't even deserve ONE
star.
