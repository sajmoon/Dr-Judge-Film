One of probably the top five most influential Sci-Fi movies, another being
Blade Runner. Both of which were directed by Ridley Scott. Making me wonder
why he has not returned to the Sci-Fi genre which is far and away his most
successful genre. It can be done, Spielberg returned to Sci-Fi recently with
Minority Report too great success. This film is superb, it spawned a genre
in itself and is still a big influence. Visually this is only matched by
probably Scott's other big Sci-Fi movie Blade Runner. The designs and the
sets by HR Geiger are fantastic and Scott more than ably makes them look
even better. The film was deservedly a record breaking film when it first
came out. The cast are brilliant, the film is surprising and fresh and very
tense. Sigourney Weaver does well in her star making role, capturing the
screen from her initial supporting part to becoming the centre of the movie
to many peoples surprise. Even before people have seen the movie they have
probably seen many of the iconic pieces of imagery. I can only add that men
will drool over Sigourney's tight skimpy knickers at the end.
