An EXCELLENT movie, one of the best sci-fi movies ever, in my opinion.
This and maybe 2001: A Space Odyssey. Holds up great, even after 26
years! The characters are all very solid, even the ones knocked off
early! Scott did an excellent job rising the creep factor higher and
higher, along with Giger. H.R. Giger is a GENIUS! His designs are so
unique, and odd, yet fascinating. The Alien itself, the Space Jockey,
the Space Jockey's Ship, The Nostromo. It was all so excellently
innovated. I LOVED the look of the Nostromo. It's just so creepy. The
claustrophobic feel of everything, the Gothic look with the paneling on
the walls, and the shapes of the halls (hey, that rhymes!) it always
feels like something's not quite right. Like there's something you
missed, something wrong. It added to the creep factor of this movie an
incredible amount. In my opinion, 10/10! If you're a horror fan, or a
sci-fi fan, or just a plain movie goer, this film is for you!
