Up until this movie came out, you never saw an alien movie that actually
touched a human being to kill him/ her, or to eat him/her, and especially to
put there offspring into them. Yes E.T. was cute, and Alf was great, and you
had War of the Worlds, where the aliens attacked from spacecrafts, but they
never got down and attacked them with their hands. Now, through in Ridley
Scott and Signourney Weaver. So you find a mysterious ship, crashed on a
scary moon or planet, and you JUST HAVE TO investigate, like you would think
that hundreds of years into the future they would have grown brains or
something. So you send down a research team, and they keep going down the
long, dark, scary tunnels, and just have to go down this shoot to find the
pods where the aliens are made. Well, needless to say, you just have to get
really close to one so they can get on you and start this entire madhouse.
But what a makeup job on the alien. Stan Winston, you get an Oscar from me
over this. Good story line, good acting, OUTSTANDING special effects and
probably one of the scariest alien films of all time.<br /><br /> 9 out of 10
