Alien A-/A 2.12.00 2.35:1/5.1
Previously Viewed Anamorphic Widescreen THX<br /><br />This movie has definitely held up after 20 years.  Unlike Scott's own
Blade
Runner, the action and sets look just about as good as anything in the
last
few years (save The Phantom Menace).  And where Blade Runner on DVD looked
and sounded awful, Alien has gotten the full treatment.  Anamorphic
transfer, 5.1 THX sound, gobs of deleted scenes, director's comments and
lots of other goodies.  A first rate movie and DVD.
