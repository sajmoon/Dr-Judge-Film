1999_February 7 

The sick terror, the claustrophobia, Giger's machine-like
organisms and organic-looking machines, the blinding
disco-era strobes and deafening noise, Jerry Goldsmith's<br /><br />Barbaresque score fading into Howard Hanson's 2nd symphony at<br /><br />the end, that great group of actors.  The Perfect Movie.
