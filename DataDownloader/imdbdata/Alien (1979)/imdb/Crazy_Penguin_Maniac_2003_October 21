Alien is probably the best sci-fi film ever created. With dark,
claustrophobic sets, dim lights and that hideous looking monster, this film
really has it all.<br /><br />The storyline is a great one, no matter if it was taken from the classic
fifty films. After receiving an S.O.S, the crew of the ship Nostromo go to
see whats wrong, due to law. What they find will haunt most for
weeks.<br /><br />Though the film moves slowly to start with, once we are introduced to the
alien the film picks up and starts. With the greatest looking monster right
behind them, the crew of the ship slowly start disappearing. But unlike old
fifties films, we know what's picking them off which adds to the sheer
terror.<br /><br />The sets, again, are great, but they don't draw the attention to themselves
so you can really concentrate on what's happening. Actually, they increase
the feel that these people are in a real ship being chased by a
monster.<br /><br />The film keeps on going until the ultimate showdown between woman and beast.
A must for anyone who likes the genre, has seen one of the sequels or has
played the game and read the comics. 10/10.
