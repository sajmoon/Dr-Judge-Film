Alien...a masterpiece?  Yes, I think it has stood the test of time very
well.  It has had three QUALITY(if not even) sequels.  It has more than
amply influenced all science fiction films to come after it.  It made the
female macho heroine stock rather than exceptional.  It has so immersed us
in its design, sets, and situations as to even be used of late in some kind
of snack food commercial and be lampooned by Mel Brooks.  The story of the
Nostromo and crew going to a dead planet after hearing some kind of
distress
signal is all too recognizable.  While there, one of their party has a baby
alien attatch itself to his face, later his belly opens up and a small
alien
rips its way out.  The alien grows with great speed and soon is a giant of
a
stowaway on this small, 7-manned crew commercial ship.  Predator and prey
meet.  While the basic story is fairly simple, some of the overlying themes
used in Dan O'Bannon's script reek with thought-provoking insights into the
division of science and humanity(or humanism if you prefer).  What lengths
should science go to acquire new knowledge?  What are necessary sacrifices?
The script also details the greedy exploits of business with the Mother
company being all too concerned with possible military profits rather than
the lives of its crew.  Ridley Scott directs with definite style, if not a
bit plodding through much of the first half of the film.  The sets used are
breath-taking, and the scientific mumbo jumbo presented is given its full
due in explanation and observable merit.  The special effects department
really does a great job with the alien creature as it is truly one of the
most menacing monsters to grace the screen in some time.  Acting honors go
to Sigourney Weaver in her penultimate role as Ripley, the head-strong,
no-nonsense, by the book navigator that manages to elude the alien for some
time.  Her wits and its hostility lock horns in some great film sequences.
Scott's use of bleak metal exteriors really enhances the mood of doom,
despair, and futility that pervades the film.  The rest of the cast is very
good with Ian Holm standing out as an android of sorts whose only goal is
securing knowledge at any price.  While not as gritty or energized as its
sequel Aliens, Alien is one of the finest horror/sci-fi films made in the
last twenty-five years.  It will go on being an inspiration to future genre
films for some time.
