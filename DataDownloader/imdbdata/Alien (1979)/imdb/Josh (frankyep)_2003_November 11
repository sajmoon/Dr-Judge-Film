This is a fantastic film. In my opinion, it is the greatest science
fiction
horror film ever! It has a great mixture of cast members and portrays a
great storyline that nobody has ever heard of before. Even in the
previews
they only showed short scenes of the film and there wasn't any scene with
the ALIEN. It is terrific(and if you haven't seen the Director's Cut, it
makes the film even better).
