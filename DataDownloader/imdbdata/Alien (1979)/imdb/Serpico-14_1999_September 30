1999_September 30 

There simply will never be such a film as this one. It was indeed a the
first of a timeless classic series. Ridley Scott moody and texturized
visuals have been diluted in sequels but here they are fresh and vivid.
Remarkable performances all around and special effects ahead of their
time.
For science fiction/horror lovers it's one for the library. I highly
recommend the DVD with all it's extra features and sound/picture
enhancements.
