Like many other movies that are a first in a series, this movie strongest
point is the suspense around the &quot;mysterious villain&quot;. (like in &quot;Child's
Play&quot; and &quot;Nightmare On Elm Street&quot;) So it doesn't work as well if you see
it after watching other Alien movies.<br /><br />But other then a long built up, there is still plenty of action and gore to
keep the average horror fan happy. Especially the first infamous chest
bursting scene... Absolutely classic!<br /><br />The Alien monster design is just classic and there's no wonder there are so
many sequels and a comic book... You just can't have enough of that spooky
smooth creature!
