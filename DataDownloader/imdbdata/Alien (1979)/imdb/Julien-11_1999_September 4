1999_September 4 

This film I saw for the first time in 1989.  I was only 6 years old.  It
frightened me unrecognizable.  It still does.  The whole concoction of the
crew members being done off by a virtually unseen monster was terrific, and
slathered with Ridley Scott's directorial style, it was relentless.
Excellent film; still holds up today.  The sequels are also excellent; I
think this is the best science-fiction series ever, even better than the
vastly overrated &quot;Star Wars&quot; series.
