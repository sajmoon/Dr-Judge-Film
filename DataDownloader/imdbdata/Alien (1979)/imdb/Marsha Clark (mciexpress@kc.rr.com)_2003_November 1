I went to the theatre and saw Alien (Director's cut).  I enjoyed the
movie
and do think it will be a &quot;classic&quot;.  But, I need for someone to please
tell
me what were the scenes that were changed as the &quot;director's cut&quot;,
because I
could not find them.  I have not seen the movie in its original form for
some time, but I cannot realize the differences and I am very interested
in
knowing.  Thank you for anyone that will elaborate.<br /><br />
