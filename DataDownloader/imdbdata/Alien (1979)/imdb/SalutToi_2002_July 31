Over 20 years ago this movie defined the sci-fi/horror genre. It also
created the darker futuristic vision where spaceships are not lighten like a
Christmas tree and run by 1000 clean-cut well-behaved look-alikes. It amazes
me to see that after more than 20 years and despite numerous (too many)
attempts, nobody has managed to match it. This is still a really scary movie
with a vision of the future that still fascinates me. This movie is to the
sci-fi/horror genre what 2001 is to pure science-fiction or The Exorcist to
pure horror.
