Being 26 at the time, I thought there was nothing that could scare
me...
what, with being a die-hard..One Step Beyond and Thriller fan, I was
skeptical of this so-called &quot;sci-fi thriller&quot;. Well... let me tell you, I
was soooo wrong !!! That monster was so frightening chasing Sigourney Weaver
and her crew around...esp...the ending, I thought I'd never be the same!!! I
told everyone I could think of to go see that movie!!
The only drawback was the unnecessary use of profanity....it was scary
enough without it!!
