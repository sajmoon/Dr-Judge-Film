There are many devotees of the Alien Series who do not give proper credit
to
this movie.  They think that the series starts with number 2. The first
Alien is not an action movie like the others, but is a true suspense/horror
movie around sci fi monster theme.<br /><br />What is great is how the horror is around by what we don't see as much as
what we do see.  This leave much to the imagination, something people seem
to forget in the current age of spoon-fed horror effects.
