With its influences in 50s creature features, Dan O&#39;Bannon and Ron
Shusett&#39;s &quot;small Roger Corman movie&quot; seemed an unlikely world-wide
phenomenon.<br /><br />But after Brandywine partners read and refined the script things
started moving. Add a little corporate paranoia, a highly visual
director, a Swiss manic depressive artist obsessed with sex, and
probably the best art design ever, at that time, and Fox had a hit on
their hands.<br /><br />The list of people responsible for this is long, the brilliant cast,
David Giler and Walter Hill&#39;s revised script, Gordon Caroll&#39;s belief
that within this monster feature chrysalis there was an A movie
forming, O&#39;Bannon&#39;s overseeing of the art department, including Ron
Cobb, Chris Foss, Mobius and H.R. Giger, and Ridley Scott&#39;s masterful,
almost documentary-like direction all contributed to one of the best
films of it&#39;s decade, or indeed any other.<br /><br />I feel privileged that I able to witness this in the cinema in 1979 and
although the cinema has long gone, the memory of that first viewing
remains.<br /><br />It was and still is the best cinema experience of my life.
