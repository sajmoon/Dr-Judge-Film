it's such an interesting experience to read comments for
alien.
For me, this film is a real cult. like it says in a comment, i have never
seen the equal of cold beauty and dark atmosphere (except blade runner)in
this film.
but the interesting thing is, people says aliens is better. oh my god,
people should be kidding, if not we'll see/hear more plastic, worthless
crap
like titanics, die hards (IV-VI-X etc), spice girls etc. Maybe we all
deserve these because we prefer not to protect real art.<br /><br />Alien is a masterpiece of cinema art...
