In theaters everyone can hear you scream!<br /><br />Let's cut the crap and admit the first of the Alien series is still the
best. While Cameron and Fincher are worthy successors, Scott joined
forces
with the visionary Swiss surrealist Giger to create a stunning horror-sf
flick that still stands today. Just watch it again and it's really
extraordinary to find out it's a film from 1979 (just compare it to other
70's films and you know what we're talking about). Cameron just made a
good
roller coaster, but gone was the suggestive power that made the first one
such a terrific thrill. And Fincher lost his way due to horrible
production
conditions (he wanted to jump from tunnel to tunnel to create an overall
vision, but the studio wouldn't let him). Number 4 in the series is just
a
plain comic, period.<br /><br />Isn't it great that in Scott's original you only see the Alien for a
couple
of minutes? He used the same method to scare the audience Jacques
Tourneur
used in the original Cat People: sound. The Alien literally hisses its
way
through the film. Only on certain designated moments in the film, Scott
lets
it all go, which makes the horror even more convincing (the chestbuster
scene!). All in all, Alien is pure art, hence the success of Giger's
design
and the impact it still has on Alien fans worldwide. Hope Scott will make
the fifth, maybe he could elaborate on the Alien planet. This was
NIN75...
last survivor of the Nostromo...
