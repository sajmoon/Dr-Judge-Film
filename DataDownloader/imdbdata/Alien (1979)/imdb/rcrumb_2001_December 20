A great movie, scifi or otherwise. Scott does a great directing job, the
tone and mood are so foreboding. Yet, you never really get a good look at
the Alien which adds to the fright. The music score also adds to the scary
mood. Sigourney Weaver is excellent as the strong character who has to
take
over when the captain gets knocked off almost immediately. An entertaining
movie every time you see it, and always good for a fright!
