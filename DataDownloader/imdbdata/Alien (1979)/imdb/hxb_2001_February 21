Only two movies have ever given me as an adult nightmares afterwards-the
Alien and the Exorcist.  Slow building suspense with little actual
gratuitous gore with a pulse bounding ending.  The ship, the Nostromo, has a
realistic, lived in look about it.  Very credible character sketches with
realistic group dynamics amongst the crew members.A great heroine role
model, Ripley, was created.<br /><br />This was the beginning of a successful series of spinoffs, all are at least
worthy of seeing, while only Aliens the immediate successor is a top notch
production.  Unfortunately, the spin off movies focused on subsequent events
of the aliens not their mysterious past.<br /><br />I give the movie a 10.
