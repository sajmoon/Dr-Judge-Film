1999_March 21 

The first installment of the greatest science fiction saga ever. Alien was
made in 1979 when Sigourney Weaver was a little-known actress, and she makes
a lasting impression in this film. As you will no doubt know, this is an
intense, claustrophobic film set aboard the space freighter Nostromo. An
alien manages to get aboard the ship, via John Hurt, and slowly each crew
member is picked off by the creature, until only Ellen Ripley (Weaver) is
left to fend for herself. We only rarely catch glimpses of the creature,
which makes it all the more scary when we do see it.
