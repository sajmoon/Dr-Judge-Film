I always think that you can tell a little about a person's taste in films
if
you ask them to tell you which they prefer, Alien, or it's sequel Aliens.
Both are excellent movies, but Alien is deeper, darker and scarier. The
atmosphere of this movie is electric and without going into too much
detail,
one particular scene around the dinner table still scares me after
repeated
watchings. I watched it again last night and found myself unconsciously
clenching my teeth and grimacing - a rarity now that so many films attempt
to shock.<br /><br />If you like your Science Fiction to have brains over brawn - Alien fits
the
bill. It's riveting from start to finish and amongst the shocks, there's
some interesting ideas. The special effects are set design are first
class,
the acting excellent and it's shot beautifully.<br /><br />See all the Alien movies (yes - even Alien3 is worth a watch) but this one
is the best. If you're not normally a fan of the genre but you like
intelligent thrillers, try this and you may be converted.<br /><br />
