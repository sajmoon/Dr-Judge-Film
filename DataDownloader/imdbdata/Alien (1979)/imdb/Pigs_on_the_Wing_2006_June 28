The deep-space mining crew of Nostromo are awakened from cryogenic
sleep on their way back to Earth due to an alien distress signal coming
from a planet. They go to the planet to find a &quot;deserted&quot; alien
spaceship. Then everything goes horribly wrong.<br /><br />This is among science-fiction classic films. Ridley Scott was the
perfect director for this movie; his constant attention to the film&#39;s
design and style truly made an awesome and eerie look. The acting is
top-notch, especially from Weaver&#39;s leading female role. The alien
itself is truly original ... and frightening (thanks to Giger&#39;s
artwork). Despite it&#39;s release in 1979, it&#39;s still quite effective
nowadays and should be for quite a while.
