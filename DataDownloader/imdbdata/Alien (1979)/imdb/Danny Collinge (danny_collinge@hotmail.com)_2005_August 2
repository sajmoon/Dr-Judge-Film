This film is awful, it relies on scaring you and not on good acting and
a good story!! this film is very long and boring if you hated the
exorcist your hate this, it might have been good when all these new
horror films like dawn of the dead etc were coming out, but its just
plain crap now. the aliens are just not convincing their laughable
really. i was thinking yeah the aliens are really dated and stuff but
maybe the movie will have something extra like dawn of the dead did but
this movie had nothing, I'm surprised its an 18 i cant see anyone being
scared of little hand puppets and poor visual effects. i saw this film
with my brother who is 13 he just laughed and thought how fake is
this!!! anyone who says but its good for how old it is is an idiot, a
movie is either good or not regardless of how old it is!! godfather
came out 7 years before alien and look at the difference in quality!!<br /><br />Main good points: none------------------ Main bad points: all of it!!!!
