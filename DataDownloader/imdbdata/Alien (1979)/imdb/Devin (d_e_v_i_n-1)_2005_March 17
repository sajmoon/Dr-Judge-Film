The first two installments of the alien saga are excellent, while the
3rd and 4th are sub-par. Together it makes a great Saga, that in 1979
changed the face of sci-fi. Director Ridley Scott (Kingdom of
Heaven)creates a great atmosphere and builds on it with good characters
and a scary creature.<br /><br />Set in the not too distant future, the crew of the mining ship Nostromo
is ordered to land on a hostile planetoid in order to investigate a
mysterious distress signal. When one of the crew members is brought
back with a strange parasite attached to his face, it is only the
beginning of the nightmare. The creature 'impregnates' the unfortunate
crew member, and before long, in one of the most memorable scenes in
cinema history, an alien creature bursts forth from his chest. Maturing
at a staggering rate, the alien begins to hunt the crew one by one
until, finally, with the rest of the crew either missing or dead, the
fate of the Nostromo, and perhaps event he human race itself, rests
with one woman - Ellen Ripley.<br /><br />I enjoyed this (The second is WAY better), but some people might not
like it so, you should rent it first before you decide to buy.
