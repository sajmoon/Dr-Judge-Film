Alien <br /><br />&quot;In space no one can hear you scream&quot; The tag line is a classic for the
horror genre; a come-on well placed that makes you expect to be
satisfied for two hours as you find yourself frightened. Why is
something that scares us so entertaining, why do we watch such movies?
I have no idea, but all I know is that on paper the movie reads like a
classic watch-it-once, Saturday night movie. Seven crew members and a
cat named Jones aboard a commercial space craft in the future find a
deadly creature (it attaches itself to John Hurt&#39;s face) after
receiving a distress call in the boundaries of space, that by hiding in
the many shafts of the enormous craft, eats its way through most of
them.<br /><br />With its classic horror premise, and 2-D characters (it wouldn&#39;t be
until James Cameron&#39;s sequel that we got to know the main hero; deadly
heroine Ripley, as played by Sigourney Weaver), Alien would seem like
little more then the average gore-infested horror fest.<br /><br />Not under the direction of master filmmaker Ridley Scott (Blade Runner,
Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, Thelma and Louise,just in case you didn&#39;t
know). Perhaps one of the most versatile directors of the age, with
this film he not only established the fact that he could build mounding
tension and create an intense thriller, but as he always does he
showcased his brilliant eye for detail; that which makes the movie so
much more memorable and so much better.<br /><br />It was two years after Spielberg and George Lucas had been teaching
audiences space was full of friendly inter-galactic cuddly beings, that
Alien came about, and it successfully defied this craze by introducing
to us one hell of a scary, acid-drooling monster. Ridley Scott
re-imagined space as a bleak, soulless, empty and shockingly quiet
desolate place; where people not only don&#39;t find the idea of space
travel interesting, they find it a common occurrence; a bore in fact,
no more then a dull routine. The distress call interrupts the crew&#39;s
sleep, and this is annoying, not a chance to act heroic (as surely the
motley crew of Star Wars would be).<br /><br />Everything about the ship is captured in a brilliant detail; the dark
corridors and claustrophobic air shafts reflect black shadows
everywhere, and make the spaceship seem very enclosed and a very scary
fright house (complete with the title&#39;s unwelcome inhabitant). The
lights of the main control room shine brilliantly; the outside,
inhospitable land where the Alien is discovered is as breathtaking as
it is terrifying. Even the creature itself is a work of art; the
massive beast has a dark beauty; it is a superbly designed foe, and for
once in a horror movie the monster is actually frightening.<br /><br />This dark look and feel was a tremendous landmark in cinema for both
sci-fi and the horror genres. Alien successfully introduced the idea
not all outer-space beings were friendly, and sci-fi movies could be
adult-oriented. It even ties with Silence of the Lambs for best horror
film ever in my book (though the star-power of Anthony Hopkins has an
edge). 10/10 <br /><br />&quot;Anybody ever tell you, you look dead?&quot;-Alien
