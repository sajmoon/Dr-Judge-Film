This movie holds a special place in my heart as the first really scary movie
I remember seeing.  (I was only 7 when it came out.)  I've seen it countless
times since then and it still has the power to freak me out a little if I'm
in the right mood.  There are very few films that actually SCARE me, and
this is one of them.  Ridley Scott gave us a true masterpiece with this one.
 (Although I love BLADE RUNNER, I would say that ALIEN is superior
technically and more accessible.)<br /><br />Excellent acting by all involved.  Sigourney Weaver is notable as the
heroine/survivor, of course, but the entire cast is terrific, which is the
film's greatest strength--you don't know who is going to live until the end.
 Tom Skerritt as Dallas is my personal favorite.  It's too bad he only does
Aleve commercials now!  Geiger's alien looks awesome too.<br /><br />The scariest scene (to me) is near the end when Ripley is pushing the air
vent buttons trying to coax the alien out of hiding... that just gets to me
every time.  &quot;Lucky, lucky...&quot;
