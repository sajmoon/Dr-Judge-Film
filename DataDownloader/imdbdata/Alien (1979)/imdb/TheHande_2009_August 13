The originator of the Alien film franchise has aged well for a science
fiction horror tale. Ridley Scott&#x27;s knack for making visually
impressive films really shows and the world owes him and H. R. Giger
for creating one of the most memorable monsters in film history.<br /><br />Having said that, Scott&#x27;s film has never been my favorite of the
franchise. The opening is as impressively artistic as it is,
regrettably, boring. The cast minus Ian Holm and Sigorney Weaver all
lack the much needed element of personality and Scott&#x27;s loose
directorial approach makes the dialogue sound really indifferent. The
intensity does begin to pick up after the first act but at no point do
the actors really stand out in my view. Even John Hart only stands out
because of the chest-burster scene.<br /><br />The film however has enough memorable scares and moments that it does
keep you entertained. However, in the areas of narrative, direction and
pacing I feel this movie is the least powerful in the franchise.
