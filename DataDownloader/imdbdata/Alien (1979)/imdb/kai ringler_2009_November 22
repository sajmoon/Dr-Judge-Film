well it&#x27;s taken me the better part of 30 years to see this and now i
finally have. Sigourney Weaver stars with Tom Skerrit,, along with
Harry Dean Stanton, and John Hurt. Their mission is to stop and
investigate a signal coming from outer space, they are not sure if it
is a distress signal or something more. so they need to investigate,
upon investigating one of the crew members slips and falls, and the
alien gets the better of him,, attaching itself to him,, the major and
fatal flaw is that one of the crew decides to open the hatch and let
him in,, instead of keeping the hatch closed, and prevent the alien
from coming aboard and contaminating the whole entire ship.. i thought
that parts of the movie were pretty good,, but to me it seems like
things didn&#x27;t gel,, scene to scene, there was a lot left uneplained
which in my opinion made the movie very very hard to follow.
