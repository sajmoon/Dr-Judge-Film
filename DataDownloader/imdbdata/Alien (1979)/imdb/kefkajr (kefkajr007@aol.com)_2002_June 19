Wait so 2001 is rated higher than this? Damn. Is that off or what? I had
the
privilege of seeing this classic in theaters again yesterday and this movie
still has many a GOTCHA! throughout. The truly amazing thing is that Aliens
is even better and has dwarfed this movie to almost nothing. Oh well, that
ain't bad. Aliens is the best movie of all time anyway.
