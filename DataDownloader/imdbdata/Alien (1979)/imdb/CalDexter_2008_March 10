Alien is perfect from start to finish. The opening title sequence is
one of the creepiest and effective in modern cinema. Jerry Goldsmith&#39;s
music score is chillingly vibrant throughout the film&#39;s duration.<br /><br />The cast are perfectly suited to their roles. Sigourney Weaver excels
as Flight officer Ripley, showing the character to be tough and by the
book. (Like telling her captain 24 hours for quarantine). Its easy to
see why this film made her a star. The atmosphere, set design and
special effects were so new when this film was released in 1979, that
audiences worldwide were seeing something that they had never saw
before (just like George Luca&#39;s earlier Star Wars)in fact when i saw
the film on its &#39;Director&#39;s cut&#39; cinema release in November 2003, i was
in awe of the fact that the film has not dated at all...it is utterly
timeless, and will probably stand the test of time for years to come.<br /><br />Special mention must go to Ian Holm as the science officer Ash. His
portrayal of this character is perfect. I won&#39;t spoil it for you dear
readers who have not seen this classic, but Holm is a revelation here
(as is his character) and you will remember his part in this film (as
well as the infamous dinner table sequence). Alien is the best science
fiction horror film ever. It has not been bettered and its been ripped
off countless times: Deepstar Six, Leviathan, Event Horizon and
Sunshine come to mind. You cannot beat perfection.
