The beginning of the Alien legacy and a true classic and full credit to
H.G Giger who designed the look of the Aliens.I think that Ridley Scott
has directed some Classics and i think this is one of them. There is a
good cast of actors and what must of been great special visual effect
artists in their day,.The Nostromo ship looked very impressive with
futuristic gizmos and stuff inside the ship,Lv-426 looked good and the
derelict spacecraft with all the alien eggs all looked good it was
probably new to sci fi fans. I wasn't even born in 1979 but i bet i
could probably see the reaction of the people watching this when the
chestbuster burst through the John Hurt it was spectacular effects for
a movie made in 1979.
