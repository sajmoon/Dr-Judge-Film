2008_May 7 
I only watched it for the first time a couple of weeks ago. To be
honest I didn&#39;t know what to expect since I had heard some pretty mixed
reviews. I not only loved Alien but it would also take up quite a high
spot on my top 100 movies list. It was chilling, well written and
masterfully directed by Ridley Scott. There are several scenes that
still send a shiver down my spine no matter how many times I watch it,
for instance the scene in which the alien comes out of John Hurt.
Sigourney Weaver never looked sexier. Since then I have made it my
mission to view Ridley Scott&#39;s other work which I hadn&#39;t seen before. I
thought Blade Runner was rather boring but I absolutely loved American
Gangster. Viewing most of his movies made me realise that Alien is his
finest work. Aliens wasreally good but not a patch on the original.
Along with Halloween Alien is my favourite horror movie. An unmissable
horror flick.
