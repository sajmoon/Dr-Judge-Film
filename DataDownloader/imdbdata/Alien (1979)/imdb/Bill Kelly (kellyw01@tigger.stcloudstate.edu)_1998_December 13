1998_December 13 

Ridley Scott must have been a fan of Alfred Hitchcock to
create
a stunning horror film set in the remote regions of space.
The
tagline couldn't be more true than by saying, &quot;in space where no one can
hear you scream&quot;.  How true.  The set design is gothic in detail...superbly
created!!!  This sets the tension of the film as well.  The acting is
superb!!!
