What an experience. Although I had seen Alien before, I was 12 years old and
the nuances and suspense was apparently completely lost on me because I was
terrified at several different moments while viewing the re-released
Director's cut in the theater on Halloween.  I actually compare the
experience to having seen Jaws again 15 years after I originally watched it.
 I knew I was scared, but I didn't realize how good the film was until I
watched it again with more educated eyes.<br /><br />Alien succeeds in its ability to take something as simplistic as the
`searching for the intruder/foreign element/monster' plot device and turning
it into both a horror film and psychological mind game.  We are more
frightened *before* we see the Alien, but it is certainly no slouch when we
*do* finally get to set eyes on it.  The acting is simply passable, but it
was not necessary to emote much more than panic and screams in this film. <br /><br />My recommendation is to see the film and then do some research.  Simply by
checking IMDB trivia facts I learned some fascinating background information
that actually endured the film to me even more.  This is one of those films
that people should see at least once, if anything, chalk it up to one of
those films like The Godfather where having seen it will at least give you
something to talk about at those pesky cocktail parties. <br /><br />--Shelly
