This is the beginning and it probably will be the end of my Sci-Fi life.
When i saw this movie (actually a couple a years after the premiere) i
experienced one of the most joyful moments of my life. I doubt i will ever
see a Sci-Fi horror as good as this again. The combination of Scot and
Gigher is just TO perfect !
