Being Sigourney Weaver's first major role, she acts with such exellence and
believeability that any other actor for the part of Ellen Ripley would be
unthinkable! 
This film is truly a milestone in science fiction - and movie history! I've
seen it about a hundred times, and if you haven't - then I suggest you
do!
