 &quot;Alien&quot; was the first (and best) of the four films released to date
starring Sigourney Weaver as Ripley the hard assed alien
fighter.<br /><br /> Briefly the story centers on a space freighter of the future on its way
back to earth towing its cargo of rare minerals and staffed by a crew of
seven. When we meet them, they are just awakening from a deep sleep and
think that they are nearing earth. However, the on board computer (called
&quot;Mother&quot;) has awakened them for a different reason. An apparent distress
signal is coming from an unknown source on an unknown planet. When they
investigate they discover a bed of egg like growths in an underground cave.
One of the &quot;eggs&quot; hatches and a creature attaches itself to the face of
crewman Kane (John Hurt). After a short time Kane appears to recover but
then a creature suddenly emerges from his chest. The creature grows into a
monster and begins to stalk the crew until.....<br /><br /> Director Ridley Scott gives us what amounts to a haunted house in outer
space horror story. We just barely get a glimpse of the creature as it
attacks. The crew moves about long, dark and damp cavernous passageways from
where the creature could emerge at any moment. Scott creates an atmosphere
of claustrophobia as the crew is trapped where in space..no one can hear you
scream. He also utilizes Ripley's cat, Jones to great effect.<br /><br /> The cast is first rate. In addition to Weaver as Ripley and John Hurt as
Kane, there is Tom Skerritt as Dallas the commander of the ship, Veronica
Cartright as Lambert, Yahfet Kotto as Parker, Harry Dean Stanton as Brett
and Ian Holm as Ash the Science officer who has secrets of his own. All turn
in excellent performances as Ridley Scott keeps the suspense
building.<br /><br /> For a perceived horror picture there is surprisingly little on screen
violence involving the creature, as this is largely left to the imagination
of the viewer. Two scenes involving the Ash and Kane characters are the
exception.<br /><br /> An excellent well directed sci-fi horror film.<br /><br />
