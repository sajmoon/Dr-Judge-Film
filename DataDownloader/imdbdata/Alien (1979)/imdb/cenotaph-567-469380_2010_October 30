if you haven&#x27;t watched this film and your looking for a worthwhile 1
and a 1/2 hours or so out of your life, i suggest you watch it. just
make sure you watch the original release and not the &#x22;director&#x27;s cut&#x22;
first. if you need an explanation, the original release basically is
the directors cut.<br /><br />what is the film about: people are stalked by an alien on a
spaceship!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />if you&#x27;ve seen spoiling images of the visuals included in this film,
don&#x27;t let it turn you off. the visual elements of the film are so
powerful yet all the other elements come together with just as much
ferocity. it doesn&#x27;t really matter if sci-fi, horror or creature films
aren&#x27;t your thing, this is brilliantly made, and quite scarily
artistic. its probably as intelligently executed a film as can be as
far as films that mainly deal with physicality go. that is, after all,
what is so recommendable about alien in my opinion: it&#x27;s visceral
cinema, and plays with some of our most fun and troubling responses to
whats possible on screen.<br /><br />most of what the alien franchise has to offer is in this film by Ridly
Scott. in my honest opinion, this film so freely and masterfully and
explicitly uses the powerful visuals to truly memorable effect.
