When this first came out in '79, the TV ads themselves scared the living
beans out of me.  Never mind that I was only 14 at the time; they would have
done the trick if I were 54!  Little did I know just how frightening the
actual movie would be!<br /><br />&quot;Alien&quot;'s story-line has more to do with the old sci-fi film &quot;It!  The
Terror from Beyond Space&quot;, about an alien who sneaks aboard a spaceship and
terrorizes its passengers.  Of course, there's light-years difference
between Ray &quot;Crash&quot; Corrigan and this beast.  <br /><br />The plot remains the same, save for more modern tweaks and advances in
technique.  And the actors herein are all in peak form.  Starting with the
ever-radiant Weaver and continuing with Skeritt, Kotto, Stanton, Hurt, Holm
and Cartwright, everyone does a fantastic job under the carefully-wrought
direction of Scott, modulating terror and amazement at once as the alien
gets aboard ship, terrorizing, attacking and destroying all in its path. <br /><br />It would be unfair to divulge more than that, as this is less a film than an
experience; one best left to be witnessed in a pitch-black room with a
pillow clutched tightly in your arms.  If you are a serious fan of sci-fi
and/or horror, this is the film for your collection.  <br /><br />There are so many great scenes, classic moments and downright wonderment
with outer space along with the terror of the situation that &quot;Alien&quot; is
rightly considered a landmark in the realms of sci-fi and, as other
reviewers have noted, stands the test of time.  <br /><br />As for myself, I'll take this film over any of its latter-day rip-offs any
day.<br /><br />Ten stars and a bronzed Face-Hugger for &quot;Alien&quot;, a classic example of just
what a bad alien can do, especially in the last twenty minutes of this
film.<br /><br />Talk about a bonus situation.
