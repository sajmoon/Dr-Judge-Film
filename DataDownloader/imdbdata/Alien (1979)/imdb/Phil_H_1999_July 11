1999_July 11 

There is nothing to be said, this film is more than just a horror film,
it's
become a whole subsegment of our own society. Lines, characters, ideas
from
this film have all worked their way into our collective consciousness.
This
film remains as powerful and vibrant now as it was when first released.  A
masterpiece of filmwork.  Worthy of being in anyone's
collection.
