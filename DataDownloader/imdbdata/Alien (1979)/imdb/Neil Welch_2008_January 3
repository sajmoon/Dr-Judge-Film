Alien is a good film with a number of major flaws, some of which should
never have been allowed into the final released print. I saw it in the
cinema on its original release, and was throughly looking forward to it
being both a sci-fi and horror fan.<br /><br />1. So I was bemused to spend the first 5 minutes wandering over every
square inch of the Nostromo. It was almost as if I was being told
&quot;We&#39;ve spent 5 million bucks on these sets, and you&#39;re going to see
every square inch before we even start the film.&quot; <br /><br />2. An hour of inconsequential fluff before anything happened. An hour!! <br /><br />3. Face hugger - good, from the alien spaceship to its final demise in
the sickbay. This was more like it.<br /><br />4. Chestburster - absolutely horrific. Until that is, it looked round
like a curious cartoon mole popping up out of a mole-hole, and
skittered off to hide and grow. Everyone in the cinema laughed.
Everyone. The entire impact of the chest bursting - thrown away. I
can&#39;t believe that they wouldn&#39;t have been aware of this before putting
the film into release.<br /><br />5. Rewiring Ash. Sigourney Weaver is wiring up a dummy head prior to
Ian Holm&#39;s head, protruding through a false floor, answering her
questions. So how do they bridge the transition from false head to real
head? By using a cutaway to Ripley concentrating on the task in hand.
No, they don&#39;t bridge it at all - instead, there is the most jarring
jump-cut in the history of cinema. Even people who aren&#39;t versed in the
grammar of cinema know that something cronky has happened, even if they
can&#39;t put their fingers on what it is. This is Basic Film-making, first
term, first lesson. Just plain awful.<br /><br />6. From here to the end, apart from the illogicalities and unanswered
questions, the rest of the film is pretty good.<br /><br />Is that enough to make up for those glaring glitches? Not in my book.
