The best Sci-fi movie of all time.  The cinematography was awesome.  I saw
this at the theater before they started making the screens as big as my TV
and WOW!  The way they were always leading you into thinking that
something
was going to jump out of one side of the screen or the other...setting you
up for when it really happened was brilliant!
