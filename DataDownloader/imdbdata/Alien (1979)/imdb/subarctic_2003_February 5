The very beginning of the Alien Saga starts off in 1979 with Ridley
Scott's
ALIEN.<br /><br />It's really quite doubtful that the moods in this movie, though often
imitated, will ever be effectively duplicated.  I think that the actual
mystery of seeing this creature for the first time is quite marvelous.<br /><br />At its core, Alien is technically a horror movie - and, though I'm not a
fan
of the genre, this movie got to me (I now own all three on DVD).  It's
stylistic, dark, and unforgiving.<br /><br />This of course being the first movie in the saga, will be when you're all
introduced to the most bad-assed sci-fi heroine of all time.  Lt. Ellen
Ripley, though not a soldier or warrior, is more assertive and tough than
you might think that average warrant officer might be... and you will see
her endless battle throughout Alien, Aliens(1986), and Alien 3(1992) - I
don't care what they tell you - they did NOT make a 4th one.  Well it just
does not exist... IMO.<br /><br />Although the sequel, James Cameron's ALIENS, is much better, this movie is
where it all started, it is REALLY GOOD and... oh hell just go see it
already!
