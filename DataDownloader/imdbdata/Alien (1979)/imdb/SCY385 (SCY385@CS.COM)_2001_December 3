I've seen many sci-fi flicks in my many years.  This is the one that I
have
maintained the most respect for.  First of all it has a great story.  You
can ,actually, see how this situation could really evolve, which only adds
to the horror of it.  Second, it has a director that respects the story,
and
gives it what it needs to unfold.  Third, the cast is great.  The
producers
made some gutsy moves in their choices of actors.  Making Ripley a woman
gave us one of the first female action heroes of the 80's.  Also, none of
these actors were exactly box-office draws in 1979.  People might have not
even gone to see this film based on that fact alone, but this movie had
something that trancended star power.  The fourth reason for it's success
is
the excellent production of everything that you see on screen.  There are
movies that cost 80 Million dollars, and don't look this good!!  The
fifth,
and most important part of Alien's success is H.R. Giger's monster.
That's
one creepy looking what-ever-it-is!!!  If you really want to get into the
world of Alien, read the book!!  It has some things that were not in the
movie, but might answer a few questions, anyway.  Many have tried, but no
one has topped the first Alien!!!
