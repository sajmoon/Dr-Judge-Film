Yeah, not really sure this movie needs an introduction, but here it
comes anyway. &#x22;Alien&#x22; is a 1976 Ridley Scott directed Sci-Fi Horror
flick starring Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, a warrant officer on a
mining ship that begins to encounter strange creatures. Now, It&#x27;s hard
for me to say that I haven&#x27;t seen &#x22;Alien&#x22; up until this point, but it&#x27;s
true so I&#x27;ll cop to it. After seeing it, I can safely say that everyone
I talked to was right - I missed a lot. &#x22;Alien&#x22; is a really great film,
crafted by one of the greatest revolutionary living directors. Ridley
Scott really shows his keen ability to develop unbelievable tension
through almost every scene. I had to turn down the volume on my
television at some points, because I was almost certain that something
was going to pop up and scare the seven shades of poop outta&#x27; me. But
that&#x27;s the thing, it didn&#x27;t always happen when I expected it to. This
is something that horror movies today seem to fail to accomplish - in a
sense, they give away when the jump scares are going to happen. &#x22;Alien&#x22;
really excels at blurring the line between the moments when you&#x27;re sure
a jump scare&#x27;ll happen and the moments when they won&#x27;t. The story,
written by the legendary Dan O&#x27;Bannon is often cited as the influence
for numerous other Sci-Fi Horror films and stories. This story is the
fulcrum of the film, and O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s ability to create unending tension
via the narrative is really a noteworthy skill. The cinematography and
lighting also really helps in creating intense strain on the audience.
At one point in the film, it seems as though cinematographer Derek
Vanlint uses strobe lights for lighting. This jarring effect, once
again, keeps the audience intensely stressed out. The sounds in the
film are really very eerie, as the unnerving creaking sounds of the
Nostromo and the shrill shriek of the Alien still resonate in my head.
Sigourney Weaver does a great job in one of her very first (and
arguably most memorable) roles. H.R. Giger&#x27;s set and costume design
really shines in this film, possibly establishing the Sci-Fi Horror
aesthetic as we know it. In the end, I found Ridley Scott&#x27;s &#x22;Alien&#x22; to
be an awesomely frightening film that effectively exudes the
overwhelming amount of skill that was placed into it.
