The crew aboard Nostromo &#x96; a commercial towing vehicle (a.k.a.
spacecraft) &#x96; find their return to Earth interrupted by a mysterious
signal. Upon their investigation, they stumble across an abandoned
alien spacecraft, and unwittingly bring aboard a deadly threat. It
seems the same creature(s) that wiped out the alien spacecraft intend
to do the same to the Nostromo crew, and it has some interesting ways
of breeding as well.<br /><br />Ridley Scott&#x27;s second feature-length film, and the one that put him on
the map, &#x22;Alien,&#x22; arrived in 1979, truly ahead of its time. In the wake
of the smashing success of &#x22;Star Wars,&#x22; the science fiction genre was
suddenly in vogue, and in an attempt to cash in on its own success,
Twentieth Century Fox greenlit the film which is in stark contrast to
its family friendly predecessor. Dark, brooding and menacing &#x96; these
are words that only begin to describe &#x22;Alien.&#x22; Akin to &#x22;Jaws&#x22; and
&#x22;Halloween,&#x22; it was destined to become a seminal and influential film,
inspiring countless other film-makers, spawning a string of sequels and
ultimately leaving its mark on the film-world, setting the bar so high
that to this day, no one has crafted a better sci-fi/horror story.<br /><br />To say everything in &#x22;Alien&#x22; is perfect would be a bit of an
overstatement. Yes, there are some special effects that look ridiculous
by today&#x27;s standards (chest-burster scene, anyone?) but are forgiven by
the film&#x27;s sense of realism, tight-pacing and bleak atmosphere. It
helps, for starters, that most of the interactions between characters
were improvised by the actors, further lending credibility to the
film&#x27;s grip on reality. Despite the fact that the plot unravels aboard
a massive spacecraft, you buy it because the characters look and feel
real (with several of the players being middle-aged) and because they
fit into the environment so naturally. Sigourney Weaver, as Ripley,
sticks out the most as our unorthodox (at the time) female lead,
single-handedly giving birth to the strong but feminine hero and the
Sarah Connors of the world. To further the impact, the steady hand of
Ridley Scott allows the film to play out at a natural, albeit, dreadful
pace. As the film counts the minutes, things only worsen for the
Nostromos crew, stacking suspenseful stalking scenes with paranoia and
a sense of impending doom, until its intense and rewarding conclusion.<br /><br />&#x22;Alien&#x22; is a slow-burner in every sense of the word, but thankfully, it
never drags. Everything in the film sets up a payoff and the closer you
pay attention and invest yourself in its happenings, the more rewarding
it will be. You&#x27;ll be wowed by the cinematography, the Jerry Goldsmith
score that bubbles beneath the surface, the strong cast and the iconic
and disturbing imagery of the Alien itself, as dreamed up by H.R.
Giger. Over time, it&#x27;s earned its high pedestal in the pop culture
world and is worth revisiting time and time again. A true classic in
every sense of the word.
