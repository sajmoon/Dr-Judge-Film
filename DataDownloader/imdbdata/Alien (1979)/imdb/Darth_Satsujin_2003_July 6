After reading the last comment listed here, where some dude claimed that
Alien was actually boring, I felt it necessary to provide a different
review.  Alien is a movie that changed the face of Sci-Fi thrillers for
years to come.  The director, Ridley Scott, went on to do great movies
like
Gladiator, Hannibal, and Thelma &amp; Louise; Sigourney Weaver, who plays
Ellen
Ripley in this movie, was nominated for best actress in the films sequal;
John Hurt, famous for being the guy who's chest gets torn apart by the
first
alien, went on to get an oscar nomination for his performance in The
Elephant Man the following year; and the alien itself was designed by
famous
surreal-artist, H.R. Giger.  What more could you ask for in a film?  What
the last guy deemed as &quot;boring&quot; is actually suspense for those with a
greater I.Q. that the common Rambo-fan.  Watch this movie, enjoy it, and
then carry on to watch the other 3 films.  Everyone of these movies has
it's
own feel and each is directed by an up-and-coming genius!
