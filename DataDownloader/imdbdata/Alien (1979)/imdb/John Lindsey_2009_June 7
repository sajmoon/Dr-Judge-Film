In the future a team of explorers known as Ellen Ripley (Sigourney
Weaver), Ash (Ian Holm), Parker (Yaphett Kotto), Lambert (Veronica
Cartwright), Brett (Harry Dean Stanton), Dallas (Tom Skeritt) and Kane
(John Hurt) investigate a strange planet. However they stumble into a
weird spaceship with lots of eggs until one of them accidentally brings
a creature on board that will soon be born, a nightmare will soon
follow Ripley and her crew.<br /><br />A truly terrifying and magnificent movie that has stood the test of
time for many years since it&#x27;s release in 1979. A highly influential
mix of Science Fiction and Horror from Ridley Scott who gave us the
masterpiece &#x22;Blade Runner&#x22; for audiences and critics alike praised this
motion picture as a visceral and startling roller-coaster ride. The
screenplay by Roland Shussett and Dan O&#x27;Bannon is quite smart and
original borrowing some influence by 50&#x27;s Sci-fi and EC Comics, Jerry
Goldsmith&#x27;s score is chilling at his best. Sigourney Weaver as Ripley
as created a Sci-fi icon of herself for being one of the best heroines
to hit the screen, i also love the dark atmosphere that makes it almost
a character to the movie much as Ripley and the crew are especially the
main star which is the coolest monster to hit Sci-fi cinema known as
the Alien. H.R. Giger designed both the monster and the design of the
film. There&#x27;s even memorable moments of graphic gore such as the
chestburster which disturbed audiences yet it still does and has been
spoofed many times.<br /><br />It became a pop culture phenomenon spawning three sequels with &#x22;Aliens&#x22;
almost being better then this as the best of the franchise and a true
must see.
