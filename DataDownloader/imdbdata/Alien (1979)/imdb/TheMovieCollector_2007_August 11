Alien is, along with Gladiator, Ridley Scott&#39;s energetic masterpiece. I
hadn&#39;t heard of most of Scott&#39;s films until Gladiator, and was
surprised to find that Alien was one of his own after watching
Gladiator back in the cinemas.... both are stunning films. But this
tops it for sure. It features a bravo performance from the marvelous
Sigourney Weaver, who plays our clever and strong female heroin.<br /><br />What is so extraordinary is that the film is so psychologically
effective its almost unflinching to watch. And its clever with how it
delivers its thrills. For example, us viewers barely see the alien in
full detail, most of the time it is set in shadows, moving with deadly
intent. It is haunting to watch the way it use wit to devour its
helpless victims.<br /><br />Aliens was great, but doesn&#39;t match the magic of Alien. Scotts best as
well.
