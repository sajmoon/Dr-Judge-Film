Possibly the definitive SF horror, cleverly combining both genres to create
a gothic horror of nightmarish proportions and a believable science fiction
environment with characters to match. While the plot is more or less
dismissable in a single sentence, the film's real quality lies in its
brilliant casting, with no major stars involved to give away who's gonna get
it next, the excellence of its design, and Jerry Goldsmith's creepy
soundtrack that helps sustain the film's edge. It also launched Sigourney
Weaver's career. What more could you ask for?
