Ridley Scott has done an excellent job of creating a horror movie in space.
Loosly based on a B-movie from the fifties, Alien is truly one of the most
original science fiction films ever.
The terror starts right away and builds to a startling climax that is sure
to scare many viewers of the film.  The acting is top notch, and the visuals
and effects are absolutely incredible.
Sigourney Weaver, as well, does a great job of creating a hero, something
many women on the screen have tried to accomplish, but have failed.<br /><br />This movie is a must see for everyone.<br /><br />RATING = 10 out of 10
