I saw the first alien before any alien movies, now that I've seen the
all I must say that Alien is horror and not action. It has many scene's
where it seems to be very scary such as the many scene where someone is
alone, you know that the killer alien is after them and all of a sudden
you hear, to me that is very scary. I believe that Alien is the first
movie where a woman is the hero which after 'alien' has happened many
more times, which in a makes the movie more scary because women
naturally ain't as strong as men.<br /><br />'Alien' is about spaceship that is heading back to earth when all of a
sudden the ship gets an S.O.S. signal from another planet, the ship
then heads off to the planet to see what's going on. On the planet one
of the crew members has an alien life form jump on his head that
breathes for him to help him survive, eventually it jumps off his head
and shrivels up and dies Everything seems fine but it turns that the
alien life form planted a killer alien in the mans stomach which
escapes and runs wild on the spaceship.<br /><br />Director Ridley Scott has performed a great miracle making this movie,
he has turned your usual nineteen fifties usual Sci-Fi movie in to a
movie that if it was done up a bit is the same sort of film that we
watch today. I didn't become obsessed with this film but I do respect
the obvious aspect that when it was made it would have been fantastic.<br /><br />'Alien' is also good because it has a boring start that goes nowhere
that gets you used to the very different characters who slowly morph in
to characters all very similar because they are all very afraid in the
exact same way. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) plays a character that is
just like all the other characters and doesn't play the main character
until the end when she takes complete control and you feel very
confident with her.<br /><br />In conclusion 'Alien is a very entertaining movie with a few twists and
turns but keeps the very real suspense. The landscape is very
futuristic that makes you feel very exited because you don't know what
can happen next. Ridley Scott has made a masterpiece and for it's time
would have been a brilliant masterpiece that only a very creative mind
would be able to come up with.<br /><br />In space no one can hear you scream.
