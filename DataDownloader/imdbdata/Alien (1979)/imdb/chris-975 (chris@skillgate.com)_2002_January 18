I remember seeing this film for the first time when I was 15. I was always
interested in sci-fi as a genre but i was very surprised how they could
meld
this with horror in such a style.<br /><br />Story goes...  the crew of a cargo ship named the Nostromo pick up a
distress signal from a nearby remote planet. Upon investigation one of the
crew members enters a derelict spaceship and returns with some kind of
parasite attached to his face. Later on this parasite is known to have
laid
an egg inside of the crew member and it eventually hatches! The creature
then grows and picks off each crew member off one by one.<br /><br />Sounds simple? Well, the premise may be but the execution is great. Ridley
Scotts direction is near perfect and the style and use of colors are spot
on! I particularly like the fact that there isn't directly a main
character,
but each crew member is unique and equal. It only becomes more apparant by
the end of the film who those main characters are.<br /><br />I personally didnt find Alien scary but I did find it extremely tense. And
to meld a great plot and characterisation with this makes for perfect
entertainment.<br /><br />10/10
