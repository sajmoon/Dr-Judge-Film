This is the king of the Sci-fi thrillers. This is one of only 11 movies I
have ever given a score of 10. It not only is a 10, but a 10 that burst out
of me and screams a 10. I originally saw it on the big screen and several
times since have buckled my recliner harness and resnugged it as I share
the
mission with Ripley on the ole boob tube. The movie lives on as much as a
double mouthed, acid spewing melon head alien. It is a classic that will
endure through time.<br /><br />It raised the level of Sci-Fi movies and also raised the bar on special
effects for the entire industry. This movie changed how creatures in other
movies appear. The creature's skull is even seen in Predator II. Creatures
in video games started resembling this bad guy. As I watch this movie my
senses are ignited as I am devoured by the 117 minutes. The planet where
the
alien is first encountered always resurges my curiosity like spinach to
Popeye. When I see those relics and those huge bones of some other victim
or
host I always try to envision what happened on that planet. The alien
itself
is surrounded by more mystery than a Florida election. The creature is
beautiful in a creepy, crawly, biological sort of way. The creator of this
beauty is one heck of an artist. The creature has a plan just like salmon
swimming up stream. The story line is very clever and is played out on film
&quot;awesomely&quot;.<br /><br />The blood and gooo is relative to the action and is not the star of the
show
by any means. There are a several spots a weak stomached person may feel
like tossing their cookies, but its not the highlight of any action. What I
am trying to say is the gross stuff adds to the story rather than just
trying to get you to go &quot;oooooh thats gross, rewind it, I want to see that
again!&quot; It fits in with the flick.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver is Ripley, a Warrant officer who becomes cannon fodder for
the government. The tale proves that greed can flourish in the dark cold
vacuum of outer space and that the long arm of the government is reeeeeeal
long. Those pigs! Sigourney plays the role perfectly. She is as tough as a
cheap steak. I usually don't find tough women in movies very believabe
(sorry, I know thats not politically correct), but Sigourney never leaves
me
with even a xenomorph of a doubt. She is a survivalist in a pair of bikini
panties. The rest of the cast does a decent job but Sig is the one that
shines. There will also be a couple of other faces you will
recognize.<br /><br />The lighting, sound effects, props, music, etc is all there like pigment on
a canvas. Enjoy the mission and see and feel the masterpiece.<br /><br />The entire series of movies are great. My least favorite is the second one
as I think they transplanted action for a good storyline, but its still
worth a look.<br /><br />Elvis has left the building!
