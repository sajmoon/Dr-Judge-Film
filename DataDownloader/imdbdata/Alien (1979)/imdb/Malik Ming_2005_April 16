If there's any movie that is guaranteed to make your hair stand up on
your back, this is it. This is one of the best Sci-fi movies around, as
will as horror and thriller.<br /><br />I've been afraid of this movie since I was five, and now that I've
seen, I know that I had a good reason to be.<br /><br />Alien is the combination of superior acting, an interesting story,
great visual effects, an excellent script, fantastic direction, and to
top it all off, a very intriguing tag line: &quot;In space, no one can hear
you scream.&quot; <br /><br />The best thing about this movie is that you barely see the actual
alien. If you blink you'll miss your chance to get at least one look at
the well-constructed creature. Ridley Scott does this story so well
that it almost seems like this is real like.<br /><br />I find it interesting that this movie came out two years after Star
Wars, where aliens were negotiating and surprisingly human-like beings.
This put a whole new perspective of what we thought extraterrestial
lifeforms were like.<br /><br />A must-see for horror and sci-fi fans. A four out of four stars.
