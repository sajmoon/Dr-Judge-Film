ALIEN (1979)
Rating: 9/10<br /><br />From the very first few opening shots, you'll immediately be intrigued with
the originality of the story in the film Alien. The story may not be as
entertaining at the start, but those scenes all need to be there to give
the
story depth and intelligence, so if I was to watch the movie again, I would
not be bored watching the scenes that didn't entertain as highly as the
middle and end scenes did. I couldn't believe the standards of the special
effects for a 1979 movie, they are totally stunning and don't look fake at
all. The acting is very good, the stress and the strain during the making
of
the movie truly pays off her with Sigourney's Weaver's stunning go-getter
performance as Ripley. But, it's the most hats off that go to Ridley Scott,
who directs the film with a positive side, bringing the potentially
uninteresting to the horrifyingly memorable. Yes, Alien is horrifying. Most
of the suspense comes from the cat Jones. Whenever he's on screen and the
characters are trying to capture him, we know the alien is gonna come up
and
get someone gore-good. Even though you know that person on-screen is
alien-baby bait, you still get a hell of a fright watching them get torn to
pieces. In short: classic sci-fi horror.
