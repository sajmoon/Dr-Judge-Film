Every now and then a daring combination has a good and unique movie as
a result. &#x22;Alien&#x22; is one of those movies, along with it&#x27;s sequel
&#x22;Aliens&#x22; that mixes science-fiction, horror and action.<br /><br />The best thing about the movie is its atmosphere which makes it notable
that Ridley Scott is the one that directed this movie. His style might
be a bit slow for some but it makes the atmosphere very chilling and
mysterious. It&#x27;s the most atmospheric horror movie ever made also
thanks to the chilling musical score by Jerry Goldsmith, good camera
work and lighting<br /><br />The most surprising thing about the movie is the character Ripley
played by Sigourney Weaver. She begins as a small character but later
in the movie she turns into the main (heroin) character. She really is
one of the best female characters in movie history and is even better
in &#x22;Aliens&#x22;.<br /><br />The movie is filled with some unforgettable scene&#x27;s (the dinner scene
is a classic) and some scene&#x27;s that will bring you to the edge of your
seat even though some of the horror is at times predictable (splitting
up is always asking to get yourself killed).<br /><br />The acting is top class, thanks to the directing and some good
dialogue. Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, Harry
Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm and Yaphet Kotto are all
unforgettable.<br /><br />A must see classic science-fiction/horror movie.<br /><br />10/10<br /><br />http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/
