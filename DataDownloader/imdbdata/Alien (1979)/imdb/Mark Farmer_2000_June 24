This has to rank as one of the most groundbreaking movies of all time.
Even
after 21 years of release it is still as scary as ever.  If this was to be
released today it wouldn't look that out of place, as the sfx have been so
cleverly done, only the computer's make it look old fashioned.  The most
amazing thing about the whole film is it's ability to play on man's fear
of
the dark &amp; of smothering/suffocation to make you not hate the alien but
only
to fear it greatly.  This was the first film to make me look under the bed
repeatedly before putting the light out at night.  The only other film to
really do that was John Carpenter's The Thing, which made you look at
every
living creature suspiciously for a while after seeing it.  Alien
revitalised
a stagnant movie genre by shaking off the B pic image normally given to
space monster movies &amp; in doing so set an awesome benchmark for other's to
follow, few have done it anywhere near as well. All the sequels have been
different in their own special way but none truly captures the tenseness &amp;
claustrophobic quality of this terror masterpiece.  This is a must have
film
for any collection.
