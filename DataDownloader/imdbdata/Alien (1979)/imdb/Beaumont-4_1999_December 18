I just thought this was such a brilliant movie. I only first saw it last
year, but I loved it. Both the Sci-Fi and the Horror work amazingly
together. While it's not the scariest I've ever seen, it still is very
scary. And I wonder why they took out all those graphic elements listed in
the trivia section...<br /><br />10 out of 10.
