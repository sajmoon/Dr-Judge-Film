The result was beautiful, it&#x27;s the ultimate monster-piece of Sci-Fi and
Horror. To date, no other movie has achieved what &#x22;Alien&#x22; did.<br /><br />When I think of sci-fi oriented plots the words that immediately come
to my mind are complicated, interesting, intelligent, fantasy. &#x22;Alien&#x22;
mixes those elements with the Horror genre and it provokes a revolution
in cinema overall.<br /><br />The plot is breath taking since the beginning of the movie and it&#x27;s
supported with spectacular f/x, creepy explanations, technical oriented
dialogs, and even settings.<br /><br />Horror happens and is exploited here when the Alien grows up and
decides to annihilate the tripulation. We get chilling chasing
sequences, creepy environments that breathe death and uncertainty, a
scary monster, and nightmarish sounds.<br /><br />The action is non-stop and it&#x27;s equilibrated with clever dialogs and
interesting explanations towards the system of the ship, and a new form
of life.<br /><br />This is a groundbreaking film that changed cinema in a positive manner.
It demonstrates that Hollywood can be dark, violent, unsettling, in
terms of quality. Money well spent here.<br /><br />The legend of &#x22;Alien&#x22; started here and created a new form of fear... in
space. Plus it&#x27;s tag line is amongst the best of history.
