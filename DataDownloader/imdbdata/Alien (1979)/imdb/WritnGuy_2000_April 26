I absolutely love this movie. From the great plot, to the  slowly growing
tension, to the great acting, this film is a masterpiece in itself that is
not to be missed.<br /><br />The ship Nostromo is moving quite well through the galaxy, the crew in deep
slumber. They are then awoken by the contact of a planet (I think, I don't
remember), and they investigate. One crew member is attacked by a
face-hugging creature, and it seems as if he will be okay, until that night,
during dinner. A baby alien rips out of his stomach and flees (in a sort of
funny scene) and hides out in the ship, waiting to attack. The remainder of
the crew, scared and unsure, go about finding this thing, and as it begins
to kill, it starts to grow, bigger and bigger, until it is a human-sized
creature, and able to rip prey apart in seconds. As it does, over and over,
until Ellen Ripley is left to battle it and escape with her
life.<br /><br />This really is a great movie. Sigourney Weaver has a hell of a lot of
talent, and she displays it quite well in this. She truly is one of the best
heroines of the horror genre, along with Marilyn Burns (Texas Chainsaw
Massacre, Eaten Alive) and Jamie Lee Curtis. She's tough, smart, and has a
great scream. (Especially in the end, during the final battle with the alien
in the escape pod.) The ending ten or fifteen minutes are tense, without a
doubt, with dark, narrow tunnels and loud noises and blowing steam. My
favorite scene is when Ripley is trying to override the detonation of the
ship. That is the single most suspenseful scene in the movie, because Mother
is counting down the time, and the process's steps are taking too long, and
when, inevitably, time runs out, Ripley has the best reaction. (Smashing a
computer consul and screaming to Mother, &quot;You bitch!!&quot;)<br /><br />I don't need to even say that I recommend this movie. You know you have to
see this movie, if you haven't. I have yet see Aliens (why, I don't know!!)
but I can't wait, especially for the &quot;Get away from her, you bitch!&quot; scene,
which I did see, and loved.
