This is a good film. While resorting to a very basic plot, a crew pick up an
alien, which proceeds to kill them off one by one until there is just one
left, and the inevitable fight to the death occurs, it is done so well that
one can't help but like it....<br /><br />Although the film requires alot of suspension of disbelief (nice man in a
fake rubber suit, Oh sorry, that's the alien!), the character's are easy to
relate to, and you actually feel for them, and hope they destroy the evil
creature....<br /><br />The nostromo is really convincing, and it is all too scary, when we only see
glimpses of the alien, leaving us to wonder what it really
is....<br /><br />The film was landmark, inspiring a million rip-offs(Predator,Anaconda), but
the film is so good, one can't help but like it....
