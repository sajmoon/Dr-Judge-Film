Plot: The seven crewmembers of a commercial spaceship, wake up from
their stasis and realize that they haven&#x27;t yet reached earth. They
receive a strange signal from a nearby planetoid, send some people to
explore the signal&#x27;s source and get attacked by a strange creature that
attaches itself to one of the crewmembers.<br /><br />You&#x27;ll love Alien if: You want an extremely atmospheric Sci-Fi
thriller, if you appreciate great props &#x26; SFX despite the movie&#x27;s age
and if you want to see great acting. The props and SFX certainly have a
retro look however everything is surprisingly good, &#x22;realistic&#x22; and
never over the top. The characters are terrific and diverse, played by
great actors with Weaver doing a fantastic work. Part of the feeling of
uneasiness that the movie achieves comes from the relationship of the
characters which aren&#x27;t exactly too friendly towards each other and
from the spaceship they live in which looks more than a complex prison
than a place to live. You can actually see the claustrophobic
environment affecting the characters of the movie. The pacing of Alien
is quite slow but this along with the scenery, the actors&#x27; great work
and the clever use of sound\music, (or lack of), creates an astounding
atmosphere, still undefeated by later Alien films. Finally the
Xenomorph one of the most iconic creatures in cinema due to its
wonderful design and mystery surrounding its existence. Very strong,
extremely adaptable, without moral delusions&#x85; a perfect killer. As a
final word here&#x27;s a little personal story: I watched this again after
many years, but now with my girlfriend who is a girl who thinks of
Fantasy\Sci-Fi as something that just goes well with popcorn. She is a
also girl that whenever she sees a horror film like Saw, The Ring and
so on mostly laughs(!?!). Alien however kept her on the edge of her
seat, eyes and mouth wide open! Her reactions are my main reason why I
am writing this review, because they were the reactions of a person who
saw Alien for the first time in her life, not knowing what to expect
and she enjoyed it very, very much!!!<br /><br />You&#x27;ll hate Alien if: You have a problem with its slow pacing, if you
want a fast, action movie and maybe if you have seen another Alien
movie before. The movie is very slow, so some people expecting
something more adrenaline pumping will have a hard time seeing this
one. Also people who have seen other Alien or AVP movies might get a
bit disappointed by the &#x22;inferior&#x22; SFX, the very brief appearances of
the Xenomorph, the lack of fast paced battles and the fact that you
pretty much know everything about the creature. If you want a movie
like that go watch Aliens, this one is a whole different thing&#x85; Finally
even though I love the movie more than any other Alien film it&#x27;s the
only one I have a hard time watching again because its value lies in
viewers not knowing what to expect.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: Classic Sci-Fi Thriller (8.7/10)<br /><br />[+] Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Wonderful actors.
Claustrophobic atmosphere. Greatly designed scenery and creatures. If
my girlfriend loved it I don&#x27;t know who won&#x27;t :)<br /><br />[-] Very slow pacing. Hard to re-watch too soon. Not for Action film
fans.<br /><br />Also Check: Cube (1997) &#x96; Event Horizon (1997) - The Fly (1986) - The
Thing (1982)<br /><br />P.S.: My purpose in all my IMDb Reviews is not to say &#x22;I like\don&#x27;t
like this movie&#x22; but to help you decide whether YOU will like it or not
since everything is all about taste and expectations IMO...
