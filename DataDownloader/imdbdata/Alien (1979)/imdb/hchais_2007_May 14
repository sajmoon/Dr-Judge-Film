This movie is great. This is one of the best horror movies ever and is
quite possibly, one of the best movies ever. &quot;Alien&quot; perfectly combines
horror, sci-fi, and is packed with thrills. &quot;Alien&quot; is about how in the
future, a group of workers on a mining ship get a report of an SOS and
are called to investigate. They are sent to a world that is deserted
and an alien of an unknown species gets into their ship. After they
find out what this alien is capable of, they realize the dangers and
they have to try to escape it. This movie is now a classic to the
horror/sci-fi genre. There are lots of things that &quot;Alien&quot; is known for
today. I will not tell you anything because you might not have seen
this movie. If you have, then I have one for you. Acid. You know what I
mean. This was a great movie. 10/10.
