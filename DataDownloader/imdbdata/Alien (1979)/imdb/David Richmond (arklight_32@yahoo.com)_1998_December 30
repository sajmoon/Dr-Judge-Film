1998_December 30 

This movie really scared the #@%* out of me. But there is a deeper meaning
in this film that really makes it great. 1979 saw the beginning of the
de-regulation in government/business relations, as well as our first
experience with the threat of problems with nuclear power plants. The &quot;
Alien&quot; represents nuclear power as a dangerous, and unpredictable resource
that we need to study more before using it more freely. Risking the  lives
of the entire crew for the good of the company foreshadowed the loss of
union strength in business during the 1980's. Movies are always a direct
reflection of society, if you're willing to open your mind and think a little.
