Alien blends science fiction and horror creating one of the finest of both
genres.  It's design is fabulously shot creating a claustophobic atmosphere
of pure tension.  The opening silence is eerily felt.  The films pace is
deliberate building up to a blow out ending. The cast seem like they walked
out of Harry's bar and grill.  That's a good thing!<br /><br />Siqourney Weaver is oh so sexy.  Her strong jaw has the strength of ten
aliens and when it drops ever so slightly we know humankind will win the
war.<br /><br />Alien plays out like a mystery.  Like Agatha Christie's &quot;And Then there Were
None.&quot;  It's formula is simple: One by one until there are none. The script
is simple and could have been turned into a disaster but clever and shrewd
minds were at play.  H.G. Giger's Alien creation is scary.  It had to be. 
It's concept has been mimic and overused and has landed in Hollywoods
Greatest Creations. <br /><br />The creation of Ashe and Ian Holmes performance must be placed in this
category as well.  It was one of the greatest plot twists in cinema history.
 Who knew?  We knew he was odd but who thought the white milk was the
essence?  The Ripley/Ashe confrontation was frightening.  The true enemy is
the Earth Company. The true enemy is Politics and Business. We are all
expendable. &quot;I say we take our chances in the shuttle and blow the G***D***
thing into space.&quot;
