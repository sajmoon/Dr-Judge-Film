1999_April 29 

Film production has come a long way since 1979.  Computer generated
effects are so realistic that the viewer can not differentiate the real
and
the not real.  The human imagination continues to create the unimaginable
for our thrill, terror, fascination.  To be where we are now, however, we
had to begin somewhere, and that somewhere was with the original Alien.<br /><br />Twenty years ago Ridley Scott created a film that has revolutionized the
ideals of man vs. the unknown.  The alien is the perfect survivor.  Not
only
does the alien have the ability to adapt to extreme and adverse
conditions,
it is able to think rationally and logically.  The alien is clearly a foe
that could pose a serious threat to humanity if it were allowed to
colonize
human populouses.  Ripley, the hero of the film knows that she is fighting
a
superior adversary, but this does not hinder her actions.  Like the alien,
Ripley must think logically, and critically of her situation.  She uses
her
ingenuity and resolve to conquer the unconquerable.
Because of Ripley, we as viewers can live vicariously.  The threats of
the
unknown are no longer fearful, but a challenge, a thrill, a wanted escape.
We can be assaulted by extreme odds of  alien insects, asteroids the size
of
the moon that will destroy the Earth, even natural phenomenon.  No matter
what the odds, the audacity of the human spirit will always prevail.  With
another solar system a stones throw away, we may have the option of
proving
ourselves.
