This movie is rightfully a classic.  Many critics think it may be a
unoriginal or the same old horror flick.  There was a lot more in the
movie
to deem it better than that.  First of all it wasnt exaggerated or blown
into a scream fest.  It was more scary because there was silence.  It was
in
space, and they had no possible way for protection other than to face it
or
detonate the entire mission.
The lifecycle of this Alien which was truly original and fascinating
brought a lot suspense as well.  The egg, too the facehugger to the
chestburster to the ALIEN, shows a very elaborate growth to make such a
beautiful creature.  H.R. Giger is an awesome artist, and being a huge fan
of his work, I loved his set design as well as his ALIEN.  The absence of
eyes in the ALIEN makes it all the more terrifying.  I watch it today and
am
still in awe of the ALIEN design and the set of the movie.  Its a movie to
appreciate in many aspects.
