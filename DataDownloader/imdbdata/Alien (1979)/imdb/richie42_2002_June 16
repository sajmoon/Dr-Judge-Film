Seven explorers pick up a hitcher in deep space. The hitcher proceeds to
bump them off one by one.<br /><br />A variation of a classic premise?<br /><br />Undoubtedly!<br /><br />Ever been done better?<br /><br />NO!<br /><br />With the genius triumvirate Ridley Scott, Dan O'Bannon and H R Giger driving
this film with their unique visions so rock solid in design and concept, how
could it be?<br /><br />Ridley Scott demonstrates his unique cinematic view to the utmost here,
paralleled only by &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;Gladiator&quot;. Even the bright sets are
relatively under-lit and diminish in frequency as the movie progresses; as
it draws ever nearer its dark heart. You are always looking into the shadows
to see if there is anything moving. And because of Scott's excellent pacing
and character development - Ripley emerging as the strongest for one - you
are always rooting for her, especially willing her to get the emergency
cooling system to start up again. Shouting at her to get up that ladder
quick before the boogeyman comes up behind her.<br /><br />We see Dan O'Bannon finally get to deliver the horrendous monster he first
thought up for John Carpenter's &quot;Dark Star&quot; (remember the beach ball that
gets nasty in an elevator shaft? In an enclosed space?) And we also get to
see his workable, lived-in view of the future.<br /><br />And Mr Giger? The man who can make horrible, horrendous things look eerily
beautiful? There is no doubt that without his perfectly spine chilling
creation(s) this film would not have worked; this film would not still stand
today as one of the all time great science fiction/horror
movies.<br /><br />#62 in the IMDb top 250? Behind &quot;Star Wars&quot;? Behind &quot;2001&quot;? I think
not!<br /><br />H P Lovecraft would have loved this story.<br /><br />10 out of 10 (even if it is just a guy in a suit!).
