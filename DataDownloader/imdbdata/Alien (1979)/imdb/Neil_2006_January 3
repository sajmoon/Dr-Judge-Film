Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett's script is an irresistible Sci-fi epic
that trounces any suspense film before and since. Their use of classic
themes and new twists is truly inspiring.<br /><br />Ridley Scott's impeccable casting and directing has to be seen to be
believed. The timing and the startling horror are crafted into a
masterpiece that will have you on the edge of your seat for every
single minute.<br /><br />H.R. Giger is simply the most original and startling artist that ever
put paint to canvas, and the inspiration that springs from his work,
just had too be used in a science fiction movie. Look him up on the net
and you won't believe what you see.<br /><br />True inspiration comes from the fact that the team who designed the
ship were never allowed to come into contact with the Alien design team
and this counterpoint makes the combination truly brilliant. add to
that effects that stand the test of time and a treat for the eyes and
pulse rate unfold right there on the screen.<br /><br />I doubt whether there will ever be a sci-fi movie to beat this. I have
seen over a hundred in the genre, none come close, It is quite simply
UNIQUE.<br /><br />I have seen movies in other styles that are as good as this, but none
to beat it.<br /><br />10 out of 10 out of 10.
