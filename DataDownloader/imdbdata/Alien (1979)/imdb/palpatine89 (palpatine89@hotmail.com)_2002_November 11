Ridely Scott's science fiction/thriller ALIEN will definitly keep your
eyes glued to the screen.<br /><br />ALIEN chronicles the events in wich Ripely (Sigorny Weaver) and her crew
abord a space frieghter pick up an S.O.S. signal.  While investigating, a
crew member gets an alien life form stuck on his face, which implants an
embrio into his chest.  I comes out and all hell goes loose as the members
of the crew simoltaniously get picked off by the creature.<br /><br />Scott is number five of my favorite directors partially because of ALIEN.
This film spawned three sequells (only good one was ALIENS), numerous
comics, games, and toys.  I love it, and its  my 28th favorite movie of
all
time.  It kicks a**.  A classic, and must-see for everyone!<br /><br />ALIEN is rated R for some horror/sci-fi gore, brief nudity (porn pix on
the
walls), and language<br /><br />I give ALIEN 9/10
