Okay, first of all lets forget about Alien Resurrection and Alien V
Predator. They don&#39;t count. I am talking about the first 3, the ones
that really create discussion. Ridley Scott&#39;s horrifying, psychological
but also very cold ,&#39;Alien&#39;, James Cameron&#39;s exciting, tense, but also
very dumb, &#39;Aliens&#39;, and David Fincher&#39;s interesting, experimental, but
flawed and hardly scary at all, &#39;Alien 3&#39;. First of all, why have I
included Alien 3. Because it is different, enthralling and completely
underrated. It is brilliantly edited (just look at the opening credits
if you disagree with me), it has Sigourney Weaver&#39;s best performance of
the 3 and the soundtrack is amazing. Then there&#39;s the first, Alien.
Still horrifying, still amazing to look at and still inspiring Alien is
still one hell of a film, age only slightly damaging it. But age has
still has done a bit of damage. Its scares are not as scary, it&#39;s
technology not as futuristic, and its special effects not as special.
Yet it is still an amazing film. And then finally there&#39;s Aliens which
is exciting, exhilarating and by far the most fun of the bunch. It also
has the best variation on the Alien by far with the queen and stands as
one of the greatest sequels ever. But age has been the least kind to
this installment with 80&#39;s being written all over it. It also has the
most annoying characters of the lot and it is the least disciplined one
of the three deciding to take the least perfected route of three and
decides to take a more conventional route of the three. But it sure is
a lot of fun. So what is the best one? I&#39;ll let you decide.
