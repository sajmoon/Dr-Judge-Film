This is film making at its best, a long slow build up and a tension
packed ending. Whats more impressive that the sets and design still
look great today well part from the Space Ships.<br /><br />To think that this film was made in 1979 in unbelievable, its undated
which is the mark of a great film. i watched the DVD a few weeks ago
and its worth getting because it has ridleys scots commentary which
gives great insite into the film.<br /><br />The sets look huge and scary, the music is fantastic very classical
peaceful music which thunders when ever needed.<br /><br />Great stuff, i don&#x27;t know if its scarier than Aliens but its has a
better atmosphere of Deep space.
