2000_March 11 
<br /><br />    I rented this film last week.I hadn't seen it in about ten years.The
effects and suspence are great.The charcters are real people not cutouts
like in its inferior sequels.The film is more horror than anything else.I
was surprised at how good the effects were for 1979.Ripley is the first
female action hero.
The director does a good job with his angles.There are some strange shots
though.
    11 out of 10.A rating for all the film.
