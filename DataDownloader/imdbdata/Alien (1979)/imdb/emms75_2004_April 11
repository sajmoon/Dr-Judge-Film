Alien is a chilling suspense thriller set in space. Directed in 1978 by
Ridley Scott, this film is important to me, as I admire the techniques
used
in order to generate a response in the viewer.<br /><br />Back in 1978, the director couldn't rely upon today's modern digital
effects
to grab the audience's attention. Instead, he relies upon techniques such
as
camera angles, a clever set design, and a superb soundtrack to slowly
build
tension and create feelings of fear, vulnerability and intimidation within
the audience.<br /><br />It is at least half an hour into the film before the audience are aware of
the extent of the horrors that follow. Until then, the uncertainty of not
knowing exactly what we should be afraid of only adds to the tension. The
eventual release of the tension, which has gradually built up, inevitably
has more impact.<br /><br />The film is set in a time and place unknown to us. However there are
several
ideas in the film which we can recognise and relate to, making the story
believable, therefore more frightening.<br /><br />For example, the idea of travelling far in space for the purposes of a
mining expedition is something which the viewer could accept as likely to
be
happening in the future. Also, the seven characters on board the ship have
an obvious class system, something which we can all relate to in any work
environment.<br /><br />These are some of the qualities which make Alien so popular, making it an
inspiring piece of film making.
