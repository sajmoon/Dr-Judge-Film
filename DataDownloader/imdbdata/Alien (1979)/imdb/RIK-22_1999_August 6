I can't believe anyone can consider Aliens a superior film to this.
Aliens
is a well made action movie that has a few flaws and doesn't stick to the
theme of the original.  I suspect that if people hadn't seen Aliens and
possibly Alien 3 first they would have a different opinion.<br /><br />Alien is a masterpiece.  It's wonderful attention to detail and the slow
build up to the eventual chaos of the final crescendo is marvellous.
There
is such belief and tension even in the early scene's in the space ship and
especially when the crew first encounters the Alien.<br /><br />The special effects are excellent and even by Todays standard.<br /><br />I've read other reviews and people have criticised the long periods where
nothing happens and that you don't see the creature.  This is essence is
the
point of the film.  In 1979 this set a landmark.  If you saw the creature
constantly it would ruin the fear element.  The slow scene's built up
vulnerability and tension.  You were constantly terrified that the
creature
was lurking in the dark just around the corner.<br /><br />The main theme of this film was that this creature, was a monster, but yet
was superior to the humans.  It could think, and was almost invincible
(this
idea was destroyed in Aliens).<br /><br />All the credit goes down to Ripley Scott, the writers and lot to Mr Giger
for creating a believable tension filled, scary movie that won't be
forgotten.<br /><br />Definitely a classic.
