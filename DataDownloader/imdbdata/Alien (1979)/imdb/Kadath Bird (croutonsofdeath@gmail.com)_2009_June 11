What can be said about Alien that makes it better than your average
horror movie? Well, three things: Suspense, mystery, and atmosphere.
Each of those elements work together brilliantly. There&#x27;s a veil of
mystery over every scene, which immerses you in the world and makes you
curious about whats going on. The film relies on very taught suspense;
sure, you can tell when someones going to be offed by the titular
monster, but even then the scenes are directed in a way that makes you
hold your breath before the Alien makes its appearance. Just like
everything else, even the Alien has a strong veil of mystery. The
creature has a complex biology that entices, and the director gives
just enough of it to the audience before hiding the rest. A brilliant
idea, truly, because it ensures people would go to the sequel, be it
good or bad (And in this case, REALLY good, but you already knew that
:P). Then there&#x27;s the way the alien acts. No CG, No animatronics, its a
man in the suit, yet its looming presence can be felt throughout the
film and believed. This all creates the atmosphere, which is perfect
for the film.<br /><br />The atmosphere of the movie can best be described by the films original
tag line: &#x22;In space, no one can hear you scream.&#x22; The film has a
lonely, desolate, and hopeless feel, which makes you feel like a member
of the ship yourself, dreading the second the feared Alien makes its
appearance. Everything is executed so well.<br /><br />What else can I say, really? If you haven&#x27;t seen this movie, see it!
You&#x27;ve had 30 years to do so, so go out and watch this classic!
