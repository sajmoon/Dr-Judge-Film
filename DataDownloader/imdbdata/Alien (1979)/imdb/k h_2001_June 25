An allegory for AIDS? For what we're doing to the Earth? You can find<br /><br />many meanings in this film, but whatever they are- it's just a great<br /><br />film. When this came out no one had ever seen Sigourney Weaver in<br /><br />anything- she was the first instant woman hero to really kick *** on<br /><br />film EVER in my memory, and what a performance. Surrounded by some of<br /><br />the best actors around- check out Ian Holm and John Hurt, she gives an<br /><br />astounding performance. Terrific music and photography, this is THE<br /><br />horror/sci fi film to beat, and few do. Ridley Scotts best film, far<br /><br />superior to GLADIATOR. See it!
