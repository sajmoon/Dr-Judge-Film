First, Let me start out by saying that &quot;ALIEN&quot; has a special place in my
heart...1979 was a fun time for me and this movie was part of that fun!  I
will not go into detail about this movie, but I well say that for someone
who has not seen this movie and who is under the age of say 25 - 30; might
find this movie a bit dated!  Back in 1979, this was the cutting edge of
movie effects and movie technology.  You had a good cast of players, and a
great director (Ridley Scott) at the helm.  Anyway, I found this movie not
so scary of a film as much as I found it a trilling and fun film!  I
suggest
that if you are interested in viewing this movie for the first time, or
again for the first time, to wait for it's re-release at the theater this
coming winter.  I find movies of this sort (space type films) are always
better on the big screen.  I would also like to suggest the movie sequel
`Aliens'; directed by James Cameron, who also wrote the story.
