Every time I watch this movie it scares the hell out of me!I don't know
what it is but it's just scary!Ridley Scott did an excellent job and
should have gotten a nomination for Best Director.Sigourney Weaver and
Veronica Cartwright both deserved Oscar nominations for Best Actress
and Best Supporting Actress.The Film itself should have gotten a Best
Picture nomination.It was that good.The Art Design,The Acting,the
Spookiness is all just wonderful!It is true that Alien is a classic
film,and the tag line for the movie is bone-chilling!Remember:&quot;In Space
No One Can Hear You Scream&quot;!I rank this as the 2nd Scariest Film of all
time!Here is my Top 10: 1.The Exorcist 2.Alien 3.The Haunting 4.Texas
Chainsaw Massacre 5.It 6.Scream 7.Jeepers Creepers 8.The Grudge 9.The
Amityville Horror 10.Halloween
