What can you say about the best movie in the best Sci-Fi series except, it
kicks A$$!!  Scott did an outstanding job with this one.  Better, I think,
than Bladerunner.  Giger's work adds exponentially to an all ready
incredible visual experiance.  Even though this film was released in 1979,
it is timeless.  O'bannon, Schusett, and Scott out did themselves with this
one.
