Long before the days of CGI and high tech special effects this film
1979&#x27;s &#x22;Alien&#x22; entertained in a much different way. As most of the
scenes were without special effects it was more gore and it&#x27;s moments
leading up to creature sightings was filled with suspense as the space
crew never knew what was around the next corner.<br /><br />The film centered around a spaceship crew Nostromo who upon trying to
once again reach earth start to investigate a discovered transmission
from a desolate planet and it turns out to be horrifying. A new and
gross life form is present and this likes to breed within human host.
Now the suspense and drama unfolds as the entire crew must fight for
their survival, but that must be for mankind also.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver is fine in one of early roles as Ripley an iron and
high strong determined lady who turns out to be the hero of the space
crew by conquering the &#x22;Alien&#x22;. Over this is a cult sci-fi classic to
be respected as it might seem campy in today&#x27;s world of CGI and high
tech special effects it&#x27;s suspense and drama still holds up.
