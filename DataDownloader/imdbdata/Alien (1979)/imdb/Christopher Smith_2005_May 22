Very good but overrated science fiction film stars Sigourney Weaver as
Ripley, a member of an intergalatic crew invaded by an alien, hence the
title. What may have seemed in cool in 1979 now seems a bit dated and
at times even boring. The film tries to take its time to build up
tension, which is a good thing but unfortunately it also makes the
beginning seem slow, and the padded running time doesn't help matters.
Unlike STAR WARS, ALIEN does not quite stand the test of time. Still,
the film stands out as one of the best of the 1970s. The movie was
followed by four sequels: ALIENS which was far superior, ALIEN 3 which
was awful, ALIEN: RESURRECTION which was just as bad as ALIEN 3 if not
worse, and ALIEN VS. PREDATOR which was just simply okay.
