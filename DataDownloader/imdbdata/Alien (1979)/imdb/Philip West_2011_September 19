In the crowded gallery of horror films, Alien hangs in a prominent
position, high above its rivals. By virtue of its deft blend of
psychology and physical horror, it lifts the genre out of the graveyard
and into deepest space . While its scale models, grimy characters, and
shimmering soundtrack may no longer appeal to a generation of audiences
who revel in the hotchpotch storyboards of &#x27;Drag Me To Hell&#x27;, Alien
still commands great respect, and rightly so. It has not lost any of
its cutting edge, even after thirty-two years. <br /><br />Alien&#x27;s simplistic premise keeps the film tight and lean; a taut,
slow-burning game of cat and mouse involving a vicious, shadowy
creature whose acidic blood can melt the very girders of the ship it
has invaded, and a compelling blend of the brave (Ripley), cautious
(Dallas), and mechanical (Ash). There are no meaningless references to
childhood memories or superfluous romance. The characters and their
personalities are weathered, believable, and their mission plausible.
The profit-driven search for mineral ore provides a realistic corporate
counterpoint to the main story, which sees the seven crew members
dragged, somewhat unwillingly, into the extraterrestrial&#x27;s world. With
the possible exception of Ash, they did not seek this encounter; the
computers lead them to it. How each crew member responds to the
situation is key; in effect, seven sub plots form, each focusing upon
something different, be it a crew member&#x27;s mannerisms, their way of
thinking, or indeed, a violent death (Chestburster). This is Alien&#x27;s
greatest appeal; it provides an insight into the human mind, as
psychological horror movies should. Which crew member do we, the
audience, root for, admire, or resent? Who can trust who? <br /><br />Sigourney Weaver, so often credited with inspiring a roll-call of
female cinematic heroines, rightly earns every syllable of praise that
has been heaped upon her since the film&#x27;s release; Ripley&#x27;s
resourcefulness and courage are marvellous to behold. However, as the
genuinely disturbing android Ash, Ian Holm is supreme; his reserved
demeanour and considered approach masking the motives that lay hidden
out of sight. <br /><br />As an exercise in sound and vision, Alien is a memorable spectacle.
There are many moments that are striking. The colossal hauler Nostromo,
futuristic and industrial in design, dominates the screen as it crawls
slowly, almost gracefully, towards Earth. The sheen of the soundtrack
and the echoing calls from the freighter to &#x27;Antarctica Traffic
Control&#x27; are atmospheric to the core, while the fogbound alien planet,
littered with blackened mountains and the silhouette of the hulking,
derelict vessel, is hauntingly desolate. Spaces where, in modern horror
films, the gaps would be filled with meaningless dialogue, are left
vacant. The viewer can interpret what they see with no need for speech.
Ridley Scott&#x27;s vision of &#x27;horror first, science-fiction second&#x27; was,
without a doubt, fulfilled; audiences should ignore the flashing lights
and controls of the spaceship and focus upon the Alien. Around which
corner does it lurk? Who becomes its next victim? <br /><br />Alien is a film of immense quality. It has the capacity to frighten and
to deceive. It flows precisely from scene to scene with no wasted shots
and most tellingly, does not stray off course by incorporating fanciful
special effects or worthless roles filled by fringe characters. One
spacecraft, one extraterrestrial, seven humans, and one cat is all we
are given. And quite simply, anything more would have been a waste.
While the genre of horror may have moved on, the art of horror is
captured perfectly, here, in the blackness of space.
