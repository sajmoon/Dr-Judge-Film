This is truly the best sci fi horror of all time,and the film which
gave us Sigourney Weaver as the first true Hollywood heroine. The plot
is simple. A crew of 7 astronauts is put in peril when an alien being
invades their space craft. The moment when the creature bursts out of
John Hurts chest is without doubt one of the classic film moments of
all time. After that, the crew is slowly wiped out one by one, until we
are left with Weaver as the sole survivor. She must do battle with the
alien to survive. Ridley Scott does a wonderful job with this one. The
set is very claustrophobic, you can almost imagine yourself on board
and feel the tension the characters are feeling. Watch out for the
scene in which one of the male crew members has to go and look for the
ships pet cat. Walking through spooky areas you are waiting for the
moment the alien is going to jump out on him, but it only happens when
you least expect it. A great film, and one that still holds up today.
