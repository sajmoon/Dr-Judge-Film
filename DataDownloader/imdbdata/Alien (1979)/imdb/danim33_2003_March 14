This a great start to the series of Alien movies. It introduces you to
this
scary race of Aliens that are so memorable that it spawned more movies,
spoofs, comics, etc. However, it was scary and suspenseful for its time,
but
can feel slow to today's generation of moviegoers that expect more action.
It is definitely worth seeing and is good for repeat viewing if enough
time
has gone by, but the second blows it away.
