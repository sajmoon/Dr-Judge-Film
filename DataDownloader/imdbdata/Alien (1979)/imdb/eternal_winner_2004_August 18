May contain a few spoilers!<br /><br />The Alien series is a favorite of mine and I enjoyed the 1st 2 quite
much. Ridley did a nice job with this one and the acting is above
average, and Weaver is great. Even though I like the 2nd just a tiny
bit more u just can't compare cause they are great in their own sense.
The movie is a great way to present the new creature where the evil
&quot;company&quot; and the human factor starts it all by ordering an innocent
cargo ship go down on an unknown planet to check something out.<br /><br />From there there story unravels and one by one the creature takes the
crew out until the heroine Lt. Ripley takes care of business.<br /><br />1st time i saw it i was only 7 and i was scared a **** and I still find
it very entertaining still today and it was made so a sequel could be
made pretty easily too(and what a sequel it was) This movie gets a
strong 8 out of 10. Maybe it should have gotten a 9 :)
