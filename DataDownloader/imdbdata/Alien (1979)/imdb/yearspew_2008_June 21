When I watch Alien, believe it or not, I&#39;m not that interested in the
creature itself. It&#39;s all the other details that usually catch my
attention and make me admire the film every time I watch it.<br /><br />To start, the breathtaking cinematography. From the outer space shots
of the Nostromo to the inside of the ship, this film is beautifully
shot and makes the visual style a character too.<br /><br />Then, the characters. An amazing ensemble of believable people, even
for a sci-fi movie. The interaction, dialogue and overall personalities
of the Nostromo crew is probably what I like the most about Alien.<br /><br />The cast did a great job of portraying these characters. Characters
that I find likable, interesting and entertaining. Kane (John Hurt) is
my favorite character, despite having the shortest screen time.<br /><br />The story is, well, fantastic. Suspense and horror at its best. Subtle
and well-crafted horror that modern-day viewers might disregard as &quot;not
scary&quot; or &quot;the alien looks fake&quot;.<br /><br />The movie is a bit slow-paced but that&#39;s just part of the charm,
methinks. I saw the slightly faster-paced extended cut and I gotta say
I prefer the slower-paced original. That is what makes the suspense
work. It&#39;s not about showing the monster do something scary right away,
it&#39;s about building expectative, something that most modern
suspense/horror movies have forgotten.<br /><br />Which leads me to the title character. I couldn&#39;t have seen the film
back in 1979 and I&#39;m sure the audiences found the alien scarier then,
however, I still find it pretty scary. Not just scary-looking (which he
is, as well as cool-looking) but scary within the context of the film.<br /><br />Overall, this film is a masterpiece. A film that will always keep me
entertained as well as amazed by how incredibly detailed and
brilliantly directed it is.
