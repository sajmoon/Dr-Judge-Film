2003_April 3 

That whats it all about. This was luckily my first ever Ridley Scott movie
i
watched. And Alien saga is one of my favourites. At least 3 first movies.
The fourth is more grim humour, but still watchable too.<br /><br />But the Alien, it is one of the corner stones of Sci-fi/Horror mixing. I
do
like to watch movies like Star Trek, but even looking these side by side
is
not good idea.
Alien have more the touch of reality in it , thats why it is very scary.
Because its in human nature , we tend to be also in real life too eager to
look , handle and control everything we see and find. And ofcourse, we
dont
learn very often about our mistakes.  Especially this first, and second
Aliens movie is about betrayal and misconduction of superrority of
humanrace. These are wider aspects but these are clearly seen in movie.
Also
i find it more realistic in Sci-fi by the shown sets in so called
futuristic
technology. In comparison, Star Trek is hole different world of
unbelievable
tech. bable.
AND! in the end, the time when this movie was produced, it is remarkable
work to do such quality in 1979. Its hard to believe but sets are more
better made than many of todays computer effetcs in movies. I wonder how
long it takes to make better Sci-fi/horror movies as this.
