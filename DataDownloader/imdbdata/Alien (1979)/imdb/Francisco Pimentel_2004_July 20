My favorite horror movie and my favorite monster. This movie is the
best on sci-fi and horror. It has the suspense to make you sweat,
because we never know when it appears, and when it does you can hear
your heart beating. In some scenes you can hear a heart beat, like in
the scene where Bret is searching for the cat and the Alien appears
behind him. The scene that scared me more was the scene where the
&quot;facehugger&quot; jumps from the egg. During this scene i jumped from the
sofa and almost it my head on the ceiling. the other scene was the
borning of the alien, when he bursts from Kane's rib cage. That scene
impressed I almost vomited during the scene. And my favorite scenes
including the two that I said before, are the scene where we see Parker
and Lambert being attacked by the Alien, the scene where Bret dies
searching for the cat, and the final scenes with the Alien. I enjoyed
to the other Alien movies and I truly recommend this one to any person
ho hasn't seen the first.<br /><br />My rating 10/10 stars.
