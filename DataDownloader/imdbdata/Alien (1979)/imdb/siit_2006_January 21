Even after 25 years plus of other movies of this genre being made,
Alien does not feel dated. That in itself for sci-fi is an amazing
achievement. There are many examples of aliens in movies, and many more
of horror and sci-fi. However very few, if any, have amalgamated all
successfully and I doubt any would stand the test of time the way Alien
has.<br /><br />The cast is phenomenal and there is no weak link. Each giving an
optimal performance that leaves the audience believing them, feeling
for them and relating to them. Obviously Sigourney Weaver shines as
Ripley, but it would be unfair to single her out as all were
impeccable.<br /><br />The level of technology was believable for a deep-space cargo vessel.
It is refreshing to see a piece of junk flying patched up with sticky
tape and not let the technology star. It actually lent to character
development and add to the overall atmosphere of commercial miners in
way over their head, in a place they are not supposed to be, in a
situation they are not trained or prepared for. It was all very human
and so credible.<br /><br />The storyline is so simple and Ridley Scott does not try to over
complicate aspects of the plot. Instead he concentrates on wringing out
atmosphere from every shot whether it is establishing character quirks
or the suspense of terror. In my opinion Alien would have to be in the
top two Scott's projects to date.<br /><br />The evolution and cycle of the alien itself is so terrifying it caused
me nightmares growing up. Its anatomy, birthing and invincibility
coupled with its supreme efficiency in killing is terrifying. It truly
is one of the (if not THE) most excellent monster/aliens ever to grace
the screen. In this day and age 25 plus years later, the 'Alien' is
still nastier than any vampire, werewolf, extra-terrestrial, monster or
villain that has come after.<br /><br />As part of the 'Alien' franchise, this first installment sets the scene
perfectly better than any other saga. Alien is not the first of an
never-ending straw grasping 'sequals' but the first part of an
continuing story (ergo Lord of the Rings 1-3). Alien set the benchmark
for sci-fi horror and in 25 years since its first release, it continues
to be the example of how not only aliens, horror and sci-fi are to be
depicted, but how a movie and story is to be produced.
