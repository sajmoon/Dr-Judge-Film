If there&#x27;s one thing I can&#x27;t stand it&#x27;s plot holes, and Alien is full
of them.<br /><br />Here&#x27;s is a few things I don&#x27;t quite understand.<br /><br />Why is the only weapons they have on board flame-throwers? Why are the
crew members so stupid as to not realize staying together would be a
lot safer? Each time one of them wonders off alone, which they do one
by one, they become lunch for the dreaded space monster. You&#x27;d think
anyone with sufficient training would understand the need for a 24hr
quarantine under even life threatening circumstances. That stupid cat.
Any time anyone goes near it it hisses and bolts away drawing whoever&#x27;s
following it towards the alien, was it working for the Alien? Why don&#x27;t
they have an escape pod or pods large enough to fit the entire crew? Is
Lamberts only role to kick and scream and get in the way (very annoying
clich&#xE9; character)? <br /><br />They don&#x27;t close the door after the alien detaches from Kane&#x27;s face
(not after there was enough time for the face sucker to possibly escape
the enclosed area). And They don&#x27;t chase the Alien that emerges from
Kanes body until after it&#x27;s long gone.<br /><br />The acting was definitely solid but the characters actual actions not
very believable at all. More than anything I found this movie to be
incredibly annoying.
