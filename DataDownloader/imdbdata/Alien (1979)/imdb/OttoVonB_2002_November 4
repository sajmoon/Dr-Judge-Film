A lot of people tend to skip Alien and talk about how they prefer<br /><br />Aliens. That seems to be missing the point... From aliens on, the<br /><br />series became sci-fi action (even though Cameron's sequel is the<br /><br />most fun in the series), but if you want a scare from the alien saga,<br /><br />part one was never surpassed. This goes for the sheer creativity<br /><br />on show as well. We can all be grateful that it was Ridley Scott, a<br /><br />man of strong artistic sense, who  gave us this; his two main<br /><br />personal touches made this great more than anything else: first,<br /><br />making it a very subtle, quasi-romantic approach to horror (i.e.<br /><br />direction and instructions to Jerry Goldsmith for the unconventional<br /><br />but very effective score) and second, for hiring Giger to design the<br /><br />now classic beast. I'll leave you to discover the plot, but you owe it<br /><br />to yourself to see this: Alien is the most magnificent monster ever<br /><br />filmed, and it was never done to such a terrifying effect than
here...
