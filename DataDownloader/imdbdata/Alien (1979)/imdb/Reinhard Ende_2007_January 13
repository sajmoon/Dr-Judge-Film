Before I watched the movie I only heard recommendations to watch this
movie. But when I watched it I was highly disappointed. Many shots of
the film are dark, too far away or too near. O.K., the characters are
in a small star ship but many scenes are too complex. The film starts
without an introduction so you don&#39;t know in which year the astronauts
are for what reason in space. The rest of the movie is quite boring,
sometimes Jerry Goldsmith&#39;s make some themes exciting by using
appropriate music. The rest of Jerry Goldsmith&#39;s score is not bad but
also not above average. I can&#39;t believe that it got a 8.4 in average at
IMDb. My advice: If you want to look an alien movie, watch Star Trek,
f.e. Star Trek Voyager, episode &quot;Scorpion&quot;.
