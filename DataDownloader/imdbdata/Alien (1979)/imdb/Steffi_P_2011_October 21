The sci-fi movie, by the late 1970s was a very clean, bright-looking
genre. In the likes of Star Wars, Star Trek space travel was all about
gleaming corridors and friendly swishing doors. Aliens were generally
friendly, as in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, or if they weren&#x27;t
at least they were only trying to shoot you with a ray-gun, not bite
your face off in some dank corridor. With Alien, the sci-fi genre
reacquired that sense of horror and paranoia which it had had in its
1950s heyday.<br /><br />The look of the thing is all-important here. The design team have
created an environment that looks suitably space age-y but also very
gritty and industrial, with an emphasis on tight enclosure. The room of
the &#x22;mother&#x22; computer is easily the brightest, yet its low, curved
ceiling makes it incredibly claustrophobic. Director Ridley Scott often
keeps his camera amid the clutter. In the opening scene before the crew
awaken, he sets up the feeling of eeriness with various indistinct
movements in the depths of the set. Throughout the movie Scott
integrates simple elements of light and sound &#x96; squeals, clanks,
flashes &#x96; and his sense of timing really makes this a triumph of
horror. One of the great things about the production design and the way
Scott shoots it is that the creature often blends into the
paraphernalia, creating several surprise moments where we realise it
was in plain view all along.<br /><br />Another brilliant thing about Alien is that the crew of the Nostromo
don&#x27;t look like a set heroic, uniformed space pioneers. They look &#x96; and
act &#x96; like ordinary people doing their job. Although there isn&#x27;t much
room for dramatics here, there are many fine performances from the
cast. Ian Holm does well, all things considered, throwing a believable
inhuman streak into the mix. Veronica Cartwright is ostensibly the
token screaming female, but she plays it with surprising realism and
dignity. But best of all is Sigourney Weaver. The part was originally
written for a man, and while heroic women in action movies are quite de
rigueur now, compare Ripley to any other female character from a
mainstream 70s movie, and you see the context Weaver was working in.
And yet her performance is strong and confident enough that she seems
completely natural in the tough, assertive role.<br /><br />Stunning and innovative as it is, Alien remains something of a one-off.
Although many 80s sci-fi movies adopted that dark, dingy look, they
were typically more action-orientated affairs, most notably the sequel
itself, Aliens. Such an even balancing of contemporary horror and
sci-fi was not really attempted again. Alien remains a brilliantly
constructed work in a field of its own.
