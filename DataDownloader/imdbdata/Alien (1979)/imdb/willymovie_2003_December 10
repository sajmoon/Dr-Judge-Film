2003_December 10 

the first time i watched this movie,i kinda hated it..it&acute;s so slow and
boring.the movie looked alike 2001:a space Odyssey from Stanley
kubrick.it&acute;s
all about Pictures and sound,less dialogue.but in the middle of the movie
and near the end it&acute;s getting thrilling and scary.you can&acute;t compare it
with
the hit &quot;Aliens&quot;..the first Alien ist more horror sci-fi movie..and the
second is pure Action! it&acute;s the great sequel...although it wasn&acute;t directed
by Ridley Scott.James Cameron did a great job on the sequel!
