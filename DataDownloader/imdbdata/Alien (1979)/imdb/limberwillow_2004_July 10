I have to disagree somewhat with the comments by FilmJack3, as I found
the original Alien movie to be better than the first. It is slower with
less of the in-your-face action, big guns and blowing stuff up. Alien
is suspenseful and thrilling, especially towards the end, when Ripley
is trying to make it safe to the escape pod, and you never know what
corner the creature is gonna pop out from behind. We perhaps see little
character development here, but it is a good base to build on for the
next three movies, and Weaver does a great job in all of them. There
isn't always a need for an explosion around every corner, as there are
other ways to provide entertainment, and Ridley Scott proves it here. I
was on edge the whole way through, and jumped high every time I thought
something was gonna pop out.
