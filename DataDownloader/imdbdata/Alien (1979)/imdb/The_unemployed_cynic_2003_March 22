This movie is not as good as it's sequel Aliens. It is infinitely
better.<br /><br />Alien has set a new standard for SF horror movies. It works on many levels:
atmosphere, photography, acting, sets, scares, plot twists, story, sound and
music are all great. What sets it apart is it's realism.<br /><br />For starters, there is the mixed bunch of characters; nobody is flawless and
they all interact in a believable manner. Then there is the way the crew is
split up in staff and support, each disliking and distrusting the other
species, with engineers playing little power games to boost their self
esteem. Another great concept, and quite new in SF at the time, is how new
technology is presented as a matter of fact, and often does not
work.<br /><br />This, together with the way the movie is directed, shot and cut, results in
a first part which is simply unique in movie history. From the awakening of
the spaceship crew right up to the scene where the alien first rears it's
ugly head, these images belong to the best ever created for the big
screen.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is not bad, but this is where I usually drift off when
the movie is rerun on tv. I try to be back for the final scene on board the
escape module, which is also a classic. If the part in between would have
been slightly better, this might have been my favorite movie of all time. As
it is, it is still in the top 20.
