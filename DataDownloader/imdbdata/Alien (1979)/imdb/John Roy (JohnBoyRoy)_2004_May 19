Scott's 1979 'Alien' is one of the most emotionally manipulative films out
there.  It is more horror than science fiction, mainly because the
technology in the film is actually plausable and believable at the very
least.<br /><br />When watching 'Alien' again for it's special edition release at the cinema I
actually found myself afraid at moments I had seen time and time again, such
is the strength of the tension created in the film.<br /><br />The Alien creature's life cycle seems second nature to most film fans now,
but it must have been fascinating to see first time round.  Such is the
modern-day legend created by the film that I was already partially aware of
what I'd be seeing before I watched the film, even as a ten year
old.<br /><br />THis is a great piece of cinema, shot elegantly and with plenty of twists
and turns to keep horror, sci-fi and drama fans happy for a couple of tense
hours.  Don't let the entire hour of &quot;build up&quot; fool you-keep watchin and
you're in for a hell of a ride!
