Being 54 I've seen thousands of movies &amp; appreciate most for what they
are ...the time period they were made etc. Every so often a
groundbreaking film takes a genre into the next decade (or more)...as
the Gothic horror of universals original Frankenstein..Dracula...RKOs
King Kong..&amp;.the Uninvited did in the 30s &amp; 40s...these movies for
their time scared the pants off movie goers as it was the first time
anybody had ever seen monsters ...or ghosts treated seriously &amp; were
genuinely scary for their day .... such is the case with the first
ALIEN movie .. I saw this in the theater on wide screen as it should be
seen for the first time in 1979 &amp; from the first opening credits i knew
i was about to witness an event...not much really scares me in movies
any more but this film did the trick...it was the first for many
unforgettable scenes that once seen are permanently etched in your
consciousness forever ..thats what makes a classic.....the old alien
ship on the planet...the face hugger ..the birth scene ..&amp; the last 17
minutes of sheer edge of seat terror &amp; excitement with Ripley &amp; the
alien..the movie scared the living s..t out of me...a total movie
experience to be savored
