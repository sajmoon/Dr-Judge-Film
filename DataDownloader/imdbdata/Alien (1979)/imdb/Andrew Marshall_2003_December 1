Much more atmospheric than the sequel Alien keeps the nerves jangling all
the way through. The first time
	  you see an alien born must be one of the scarier moments in cinematic
history. Sigourney Weaver became a star out of this 
	  film, but it's really Ian Holm as Ash that takes the acting honours. This
film must also take the prize for having the best 
	  special effects per dollar. Check out the special features to see how the
special effects were created on such a low budget.
