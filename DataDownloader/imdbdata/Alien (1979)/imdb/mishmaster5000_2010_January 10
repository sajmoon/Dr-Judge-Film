In today&#x27;s modern world, Alien would never be. Today&#x27;s audiences demand
a different kind of horror, where big breasted teen girls run about,
while some maniac cackles. That&#x27;s also the reason why so many don&#x27;t
enjoy this movie. The cast is a realistic cast of unknowns, and looking
at them in the movie, you can really feel like they are workers doing a
job. As far as character development goes, it&#x27;s not much, but it&#x27;s
subtlety can surprise someone, if they pay attention to the undertones.
Another thing Scott exercises is patience. He sets up long winding
shots of the ship, and the planet, to give the viewer a feeling of
desolation, and how this isn&#x27;t a state of the art cruiser. This all
couples together with an incredibly frightening alien, to give the
viewer a sense of both disorientation, and feeling for the characters.
You don&#x27;t know where the Alien is, and you don&#x27;t know who it&#x27;ll target
first, but once you do, it&#x27;s executed with perfect intensity. You
genuinely feel as you don&#x27;t want to be stalked by this Alien, rather
than just thinking, &#x22; Oh, I&#x27;ll run away.&#x22; You&#x27;ll be thinking, &#x22; Will I
have time to?&#x22;
