1999_November 17 

This is one of those rare cases where the sequel (ONLY the first, mind
you)
is better than the original.  Alien is, to me, dull, dark, shock-horror,
trying to scare you with sudden noises and camera turns.  I sat there
waiting for something to happen for most of the film, mostly bored to
tears.
To me, the only purpose for Alien is as a set up for the far superior
Aliens.
