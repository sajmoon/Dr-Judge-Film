1999_January 26 

In 1977, Star Wars and CE3K reminded everyone how much fun SF could be,
freeing up the budgets of the major studios. Two years later, Ridley Scott
showed us how good an SF story could be told without resorting to &quot;space
opera.&quot; It is impossible to speak of this movie with mentioning Scott, since
the director's hand is so evident in every detail of this seminal
masterpiece.<br /><br />In his first major film, Scott used his artistic background to create a very
believable, lived-in world. No brightly-lit ST:TNG  corridors of shiny
plastic here..dark, noisy, wet corridors from which the monster could jump
out with a BOO! And what a creature!<br /><br />The back-story of the creature went to and fro during the production, but
Scott had to cut most of the exposition to keep the tension line going..nice
call. H.R. Giger's exquisitely hideous design was an instant classic,
inspiring as much terror as the creature's modus operandi.<br /><br />The cast is exceptional -  the only non-veteran actor was Sigourney Weaver,
in her first major film. The rest were all accomplished actors long before
this movie. Was this some bargain-hunting coup of the casting director, or a
commitment to excellence? Don't tell me!<br /><br />This film spawned a franchise of debatable importance, but more importantly,
it paved the way for more serious SF work. Its success led Ridley Scott onto
Blade Runner - another classic SF movie with the grunge feel of a nihilistic
future.<br /><br />
