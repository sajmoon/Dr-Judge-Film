Definatly one the greatest sci-fi films ever made! It's amazing alien
designs (made possible by none other than the talents of surealist H.R.
Giger) are what made the film a milestone in modern sci-fi film making.
Another contributing factor is the astounding performances of the actors
who
portrayed the doomed crew of the Nostromo. The haunting atmosphere and
attitude of the film is another thing that makes this film so memorable.
This is a definate must-see for any sci-fi fan! This is an amazing visual
spectacle that will amaze you, scare you, and even shock
you!
