10/10  Movie: Alien (1979)<br /><br />Scroll to bottom for bottom line.<br /><br />Some movies aspire to be what Alien is. It is in my mind and the minds of
many others what SciFi is all about_: a sense of wondering. Every glimpse
of
the derelict vessel on LV-420 is a glimpse into the depths of human
imagination.<br /><br />Some SciFi movies are filled with adventure, and some with romance, or
ingenuity, but Alien is a SciFi movie filled with horror, suspense, and
wonder. The basic question SciFi always gets around to is not about the
future or its innovations, but whether we are alone in the universe. Is
there someone, or someone else out there?<br /><br />Alien has the answer, and it may be more than you are willing to handle.
The
movie is definitely not suitable for younger viewers, as it is among
Hollywood's finest suspense films. There are moments in ALien that would
make any reasonable person shake in his skin.<br /><br />And now for the breakdown:<br /><br />Sound: Simply eerie. The ambient sounds in the background, the humming and
pinging of the ship, metallic clankings, and every squeal of the Alien
adds
to the suspense and fear the viewer will be doubtlessly experiencing.<br /><br />Music: Once again, eerie. everything audiowise in this movie deserves that
adjective. the music is soft and understated, but in this type of film the
soft creepy tones you hear are perfect. I am quite certain a large musical
score would have been too distracting, and what audiences did get was a
very
soft musical presence that supplements the movie's mood.<br /><br />Set Design/Scenery: This film is the best SciFi film I have ever seen,
even
to date, for the set design. SciFi films always try to make the settings
look to grandiose or too extravagent. The Nostromo, however, looks like a
warehouse or a factory, with only a small area designed to accomodate the
crew. It really looks like it was designed for mining purposes since
machinery and equipment dominate the ship while there are but smally cubby
holes for the crew (which Parker or Brett one decorated with nudy photos -
adding to the realism). LV420 is equally impressive with its harsh
conditions and low visibility. Most impressive of all for me was the
derelict alien spacecraft and the &quot;Pilot&quot; as he is so often referred to
as.
The scenes of that ship are simply beyond description, and to think the
movie was released into theaters in 1979! You would never know it from the
sets.<br /><br />Plot: Amazing. I hate to overstate anything, and I rarely am so giving
with
my praise as this, but the plot was amazing. It is sort of simple, but
unique. An evil unnamed (at least in the first film) corporation redirects
one of its mining ships to intercept a communication of unknown origin.
The
crew rises from Cryo-sleep to investigate the signal, as is required by a
clause in their contracts under penalty of &quot;total forfeiture of shares&quot;.
The
crew sets own on the planet where the signal has come from. Some of the
crew
investigate the derelict alien spacecraft that has long been on the planet
while Lt. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) discovers to their dismay that the
signal was in fact a distress signal. Meanwhile, those of the crew
inspecting the derelict ship find that its pilot is dead in his chair:
something burst through his ribcage. It would appear that their was a
second
species on the derelict ship, and it is very much alive. What's worse, a
member of the second species<br /><br />Subplots: This movie had a few of them. There was the ongoing stryfe
between
Parker, Brett, and the rest of the crew. Apparently Parker and Brett get
paid half as much as the rest of the crew, and there was a lot of tension
concerning the &quot;bonus situation&quot;. Also, there was the relationship between
the creature and the Company, and also the betrayal of Ash and his
connection to the Company. I am also given pause to wonder more about the
origins of the Pilot species and its connection to the alien (ie - why all
those eggs were aboard its ship and where the rest of its crew was if any
ever existed). There was a lot left to the imagination. My biggest gripe
with Alien's sequels is that none of them deal with these latter
questions.
Maybe Alien Versus the Predator will go into it, but I doubt it. Actually,
I
am hoping that it will not, since any answers given would be rushed in a
film about both these creatures. With a poor director like Paul
Anderson on the AVP film, I am sure a lot of the alien and predator fans
will see their favorite SciFi characters dragged through the
mud.<br /><br />Mood: Eerie (have I said that enough?). Thanks largely to the white areas
of
the living area sof the Nostromo contrasting with the metal, dark-coloured
mechanical portions of the ship where the creature lurks, the film manages
to create a simultaneously gritty and sterile environment either of which
could get the mind wandering places one wouldn't want it to in such a
place.
Even without the alien lurking about the halls of the Nostromo it is a
breeding ground for fear. The movie definitley illicits fear and
eerieness.
It also illicits a feeling of remoteness as a result of truly feeling
distanced from the rest of humankind. The small number of people in the
cast
helps add to the feeling of isolation that allows the imagination to
really
go wild conjuring up all kinds of opportunies for the alien to appear when
in fact the creature often appears when you least expect
it.<br /><br />Dialogue/Characterization: There is no over-acting here. the characters
all
act exactly as a I would expect random people in such a predicament to
react. They were not soldiers or explorers (well Kane was sort of an
explorer at heart -- poor guy should have known he was in a horror flick
where it least pays to have that pioneering spirit), but they were miners
and truckers of the futuristic sort. Weaver, Skerrit, Cartwright, Stanton,
and Kotto all performed as their characters would have had the situation
been real. This sounds like a duh for most movies, but SciFi actors
usually
overact, and characters in horror movies rarely act with any semblance of
human nature. This movie comes across with a real presence ofor both
genres
with character that were both written and acted believably.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Buy this movie if you ever buy anything else SciFi or horror.
In fact, buy the whole Quadriology in box set. The last two films are
markedly lower quality than the first two, but there was a lot of room to
fall from standard set by Alien and Aliens. the latter two films are still
enjoyable, and buy the time you have paid for Alien and Aliens, you may as
well shell out an extra $20 and have the whole 9-disc set.
