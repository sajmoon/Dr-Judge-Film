This movie remains one of the scariest, and the atmosphere of menace builds
up very effectively.  Though over 20 years old, the effects are very good,
and can be briefly summed up as follows: the inhospitable
planet on which they land, the horrible spaceship resembling a dead
dinosaur, with innards reminiscent of a stomach's lining, the laboured
breathing sounds emanating from the oxygen masks, the &quot;cellar&quot; of weird<br /><br />eggs......the whole movie grips your imagination from early on.  The scene
where Brett is looking for Jones the kitty is really spooky and the filming
angles of the cat at this point very effective.  One of the best science
fiction movies made.
