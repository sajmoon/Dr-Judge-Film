A landmark of science fiction and horror, Alien arrived in 1979 between
Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back as a stylishly malevolent
alternative to George Lucas&#39;s space fantasy. Partially inspired by
1958&#39;s It! The Terror from Beyond Space, this instant classic set a
tone of its own, offering richly detailed sets, ominous atmosphere,
relentless suspense, and a flawless ensemble cast as the crew of the
space freighter Nostromo, who fall prey to a vicious creature (designed
by Swiss artist H.R. Giger) that had gestated inside one of the
ill-fated crew members. In a star-making role, Sigourney Weaver excels
as sole survivor Ripley, becoming the screen&#39;s most popular heroine in
a lucrative movie franchise. To measure the film&#39;s success, one need
only recall the many images that have been burned into our collective
psyche, including the &quot;facehugger,&quot; the &quot;chestburster,&quot; and Ripley&#39;s
climactic encounter with the full-grown monster. Impeccably directed by
Ridley Scott, Alien is one of the cinema&#39;s most unforgettable
nightmares.
