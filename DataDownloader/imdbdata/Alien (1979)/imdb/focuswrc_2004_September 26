This is certainly a Classic Sci-Fi horror. The best of the Alien series
in my opinion, particularly because of the suspense. The fact you do
not properly see the alien, just catch glimpses. The terror of being
hunted, at first not even knowing that you are being hunted.<br /><br />This is believable Sci_Fi horror. It is delivered at a real-time pace,
which is realistic. The characters behave how a lot of people would
behave in that situation. They are not soldiers. They are not prepared
for what finds them.<br /><br />The ending is classic. A sting in the tail. Some people were leaving
the cinema when they thought it was over - but it wasn't quite over!
