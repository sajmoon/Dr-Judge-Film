I saw this movie a few months ago. It was very interesting. It&#x27;s a
movie that&#x27;s worth watching. I&#x27;m not sure about the sequels. I know
Aliens is supposed to be better though. The first one was good enough
for a sequel. (Unlike some horror movies where the whole idea was spent
in the first movie) At first the characters are just exploring outer
space, but soon afterwords they encounter an alien that is trying to
take over the ship. They must escape from the spaceship before its too
late. The Alien fights them every step of the way. This movie was a
little slow paced, but still well made. I thought the effects were
great for the Alien. This movie also has one of the most
suspenseful/terrifying scenes of horror. It would really be up there.
