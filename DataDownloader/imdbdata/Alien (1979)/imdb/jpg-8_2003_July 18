A good way to know if a movie is great, it's to see how it passes the test
of time. &quot;Alien&quot; does that. It's a classic. Even by today's standards,
it's
a really frightening movie.<br /><br />The main reason why it's so suspenseful is that you almost never see the
monster. You have glimpses, but that's it. The ending in the rescue ship
shows a little more of it, but not much. Monsters on screen are always
more
scary when you don't see them. This one is all the more impressive because
H.R. Giger did a splendid job with it.<br /><br />The other thing that makes &quot;Alien&quot; beautiful are the sets. The interiors
of
the &quot;Nostromo&quot;, the exteriors on LV4-26 (also created by H.R. Giger) : all
magnificient. A rich movie is a movie where the camera has plenty to show
:
it definitely does in &quot;Alien&quot;.<br /><br />Jerry Goldsmith's music is also perfect. It doesn't show off at all, it's
not overwhelming (like in other Hollywood movies). Instead, it's scaringly
efficient. In the beginning of the movie, it's very low, but it helps a
lot
in creating suspense before the monsters are found.<br /><br />The acting is also top notch. Sigourney Weaver gives here her breakthrough
performance. Ian Holm is chilling as the android Ash, the five other
actors
are also just fine.<br /><br />Ridley Scott managed to combine all these elements to create a fantastic
atmosphere. My favorite part of &quot;Alien&quot; starts when Ripley is alone and
triggers the auto-destruct sytem. The alarm going off, &quot;Mother's&quot; voice,
the
steam : all this is memorable.<br /><br />Last but not least, &quot;Alien&quot; is not only a scary monster story, it also has
something to say. The attitude of the Weyland-Yutani Company is very
interesting. The film talks about perverted capitalism, where human life
has
no more value. The only thing that matters is to bring the specimen back
for
study. &quot;Crew expandable&quot;. True, other sc-fi movies and books contain that
theme. Nevertheless, it's a relevant point. It's a relevant today as it
was
in 1979.<br /><br />&quot;Alien&quot; is definitely a must-see (except, maybe, for those who can't stand
to be scared by a movie). It combines the best qualities of horror and
sc-fi. If this one is my favorite, I do love the three sequels : &quot;Aliens&quot;
is
a scary, war-like but very human film. &quot;Alien 3&quot; is dark and beautiful,
like
a Greek tragedy. &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; is beautifully shot and has an
intelligent story.
