An austere, despairing vision that far from finding any wonder or
beauty in space instead dares to find a universe of limitless horror.
&#x27;Alien&#x27; remains the ultimate fusion of the horror and sci-fi genres.<br /><br />Its underlying fascination lies in its keynote title. No film has ever
imagined anything as uniquly, unsettlingly &#x27;alien&#x27; as this. Not just
the monster itself - a parasitical predator that has fine-tuned
Darwinian adaption to the ultimate in survival - but also the derelict
spaceship which harbours the egg from which it springs, after waiting
millennia in gestation. No one has ever bettered designer HR Giger&#x27;s
concept of complete non-human otherness.<br /><br />This was only Ridley Scott&#x27;s second feature. His highly acute visual
style (developed after years as a leading director of UK commercials)
brilliantly establishes mood. His direction of drama is detached,
almost eavesdropped in snippets, not allowing the audience to get too
close to the protagonists. It&#x27;s an approach that keeps the narrative
single-mindedly on track.<br /><br />And the tone is relentlessly bleak. The Nostromo&#x27;s crew inhabit a
dehumanised industrial complex of a spacecraft with few concessions to
comfort. Among them there seems to be little more than indifferent
companionship. The planet they visit is a hellish world of ferocious
storms, smothering vapour and barren terrain. Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s music
is correspondingly sparse, almost grudging in conceding any high notes.<br /><br />Everyone remembers John Hurt&#x27;s famous stomach-churning demise. But
perhaps the most telling shot in the film is the one of Jones, the
ship&#x27;s cat, peeking out from behind a corner as the Alien devours a
victim, feline eyes glinting in wary fascination at a primal scene it
can empathise more instinctively than its hapless companions...
