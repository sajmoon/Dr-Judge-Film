Alien was a very good movie, keeping up the suspense and horror all the
time, mostly thanks to Ridley Scott's directing. But as a matter of fact I
liked Aliens better. Aliens has more action, while the original film is
based on scary environments. You don't get to see the creature that much,
which is good, because the appearance of this thing is not the interesting
part (no offense to the creature designer H.R. Giger, it looks pretty
good),
the important thing is that it's there. One thing that makes Alien so good
is that you don't know if the creature can be killed or not, which you knew
already from the beginning in Aliens. But still the sequel gets a higher
vote from me...
Alien was also a really original film. Alien creatures is nothing new, but
living organisms growing inside a human being was well thought out...And
the
special effects are dazzling for their time.<br /><br />
