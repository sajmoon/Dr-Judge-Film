&quot;In Space - Nobody Can Hear You Scream&quot;<br /><br />Back in the summer of 1979- I was a high school freshman to-be, and
this movie swept me off my feet, and rocked me to the core. It was
truly the most frightening movie I have seen, since the first Exorcist.
After the original Star Wars- I was fascinated by space, space travel,
and strange beasts. This movie satisfied all those requirements- and
then some. The eerie, comic-book imagery of H.R.Giger&#39;s artwork was a
sci-fi fantasy come true. The Alien itself is a Phantasmagoric piece of
art, in my eyes. Ridley Scott did a remarkably wonderful job of jogging
our imaginations, fears, and nerves, with this classic. Hooray for
Sigourney Weaver being the first female sci-fi action heroine!
