This is one of my favorite movies.
It had great acting and fine directing.
a lot of work was obviously put into making this movie.
It has really neat special effects and it inspired dozens of
rip-offs.
This movie must be seen.
I loved it and guarantee you will to.<br /><br />4.5 stars out of 5 for this
brilliant masterpiece
