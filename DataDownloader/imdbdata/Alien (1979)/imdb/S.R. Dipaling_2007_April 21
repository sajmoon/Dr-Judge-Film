From Horror movie/Science Fiction film encyclopedias and books on film
theory I&#39;ve read,whenever the story on Ridley Scott&#39;s Alien is brought
up,there is some mention on the way the show was received when it was
first released in the late Spring,early Summer of 1979,was something
akin to a truly jarring discovery. And,indeed,looking back on it
now,how WOULDN&#39;T a movie set in outer space that involves the following
elements: a bleak,non-descript future,seven characters who are neither
scientists nor space heroes/fighters and a sleek,nightmarish looking
creature with awesome and unearthly traits(i.e. acid for
blood,parasitic reproduction,an exponential growth rate among them),be
a shock to audiences who were primarily used to more conventional forms
of alien life(examples:The Day the Earth Stood Still,2001:A Space
Odyssey,George Pal&#39;s War of the Worlds,Star Wars,Star Trek)or the
future for that matter(again with Star Trek or 2001). Even in Howard
HAwks&#39; The Thing(remember,this is 1979,three years before John
CArpenter envisioned the same movie),the killer creature seemed to take
on a familiar face,even it was similarly lacking in mercy or reasoning
as the creature in this movie. Approaching thirty years after its
release,Alien still inspires imagery that is as wild and fantastic as
it is horrific and sickening. <br /><br />You&#39;re probably familiar with the story by now: The Nostromo(which is
something akin to an interstellar cargo/trucking ship)is signaled to a
barely charted and presumably unsettled planet in the dark reaches of
the galaxy. The crew of seven with the aid of an overhead computer
named &quot;Mother&quot; investigate.When one of the members of the exploration
group,is attacked by a small indescribable alien creature on the
planet&#39;s surface,he inadvertently brings aboard an unknown and highly
deadly insect-like life-form that picks off each member of the
defenseless crew aboard their ship after they depart the planet. Three
of the crew,Ripley(Sigourney Weaver,in really her first major role and
what a role it was!),PArker(Yaphet Kotto)and Lambert(Veronica
Cartwright) discover that this stowaway may be more than a mere
incidental pick-up,it becomes as much a battle for individual survival
as it is trying to desperately rid themselves of the unwanted visitor.<br /><br />Ridley Scott has since crafted quite the compendium of films,ranging in
scope and material,from the awesome sense of machinery and the future
in such pictures as this one and Blade Runer,to sometimes much more
sublime,yet awesome imagery like Thelma and Louise or Someone to Watch
Over Me(or,for that matter,awesome,Sci-fi-like imagery and epic power
like Gladiator),but it was this movie that put him on the map. Using a
fairly unknown cast at the time(Tom Skerritt is the closest to an
&quot;established&quot; star at the time,even though Harry Dean Stanton and
Yaphet Kotto were well-regarded character actors before and after this
movie),and an ambitious script by Dan O&#39;Bannon and Ronald
Schusett,Scott is able to create something that,like the creature
itself,laid an egg in movie-viewing psyches and hatched something
awesome. Spawning(no pun intended)three(not counting Alien
vs.Predator)sequels so far,this movie has created quite the fertile
storyline for strings of graphic novels and fanfics. My personal
experience with it was watching something out of anxious curiosity:I
finally watched it as a much older person(I was only seven when this
show was released,and this is SO NOT a movie for the kiddies!)and it
was tough for me to sit still through much of it,even KNOWING much of
what was coming from reading synapses and hearing other people&#39;s
stories of seeing it. Perhaps not a must of movie viewing,but a VERY
effective movie-viewing experience!
