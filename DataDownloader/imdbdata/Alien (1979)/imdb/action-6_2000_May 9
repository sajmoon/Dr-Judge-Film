Alien is the first movie in the saga of Ripley.  The movie has not aged
well, but it is worth a watch if you have watched the other three
movies.
The movie has poor effects and poor acting, which is improved in the
sequels.
The only thing that makes it worth seeing is the fact that it is an
Alien-movie, but it lacks the excitement, action, tension and atmosphere of
the next three Alien-movies.
