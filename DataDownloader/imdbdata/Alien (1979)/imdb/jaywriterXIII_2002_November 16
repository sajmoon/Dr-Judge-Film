The first time I viewed this film, I have to admit, I was disappointed
in both Scott and Goldsmith. Through circumstance, I had watched Aliens
and Alien3 without ever seeing the original, and when I finally did it
came as a great shock. But after viewing the film a second time, and
especially after viewing the DVD's commentary, the very things that
disappointed me about the film, Alien, are the very things that I now
feel make it superior to any of its sequels.<br /><br />Alien is so incredibly subtle and raw. The all out war aspect of
Cameran's sequel fanfared with Horner's fantastic score--not here. The
fight and pacing of Alien 3 is not here either. What is here? A very
realistic, and a very stylish approach to a mysterious beacon where
death awaits the crew, accompanied by Jerry Goldsmith's very original
and primal score. Once I got over the realization that this is not an
action film, then I looked into the subtle nature and viewed a horror
film that actually contained depth.<br /><br />Ridley Scott's raw vision of a dark future in space exploration
certainly grounds the film in a sense of reality. The dark almost
industrial feel of the Nostromo--guess what? It is an industrial ship,
probably not all of it is kept up to code? Sound familiar? Like, oh,
most things in this world's society? No the future isn't all florescent
lights, and hospital-clean ships like Star Trek. This is what *our*
future probably will look like.<br /><br />Likewise, the characters hold an amazing amount of realism compared to<br /><br />95% of the horror films out there. Their decisions, their logic, their
personalities, and the steps they take actually makes sense and the
audience would probably go along with it if we didn't know the premise
of the film. It's always refreshing to come across characters smart
enough to try something intelligent like fighting the big bad monster
with reasonable firepower and/or getting away from it.<br /><br />HR Gieger's visions come across brilliantly, blended with Scott's style
and Goldsmith's score--tis a formula for success. But Alien succeeds
not because of action, not because of fancy sets and effects. Alien
works because it's about realistic characters on a realistic ship which
becomes claustrophobic once the Alien is unleashed. Scott is a director
who relies on what is unseen, and makes damn good use of the little
that is actually seen. The movie Alien is about suspense, which Scott
and his team masterfully craft out in the middle of space where no one
can hear you scream.<br /><br />Alien is considered classic Sci-fi horror because the team understands
the concept of suspense, and like Ridley Scott said the only point is
pure Terror. I've seen the film several times now, and every time I
still find myself at the edge of my seat wrapped up in the moment as
the Nostromo crew explores those dark corridors regardless of having
knowledge of every jump and outcome. I still feel the terror with every
viewing. This isn't cheap thrills, this is genuine suspense that few
directors can attain.
