Don&#39;t forget, this film was made nearly 30 years ago. It was also made
&#39;on the cheap&#39;. When you look at it this way, then you have to say that
the results are nothing short of incredible.<br /><br />There is a very short list of films that have a &#39;haunting&#39; quality -
combining undoubted visual treats with a memorable soundtrack.......<br /><br />The Third Man, The Godfather, Don&#39;t Look Now, The Shining, to name a
few.........and you must add Alien.<br /><br />Alien is memorable for the way in which it takes time to build tension.
The landscape is vast, the concept fresh (it is easy now to look back
and say that it was not), the special effects are outstanding given the
budget, and the acting is first class.<br /><br />This was a massive step forward for both science fiction and horror.
