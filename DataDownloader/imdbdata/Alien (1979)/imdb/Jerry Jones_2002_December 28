*** 1/2<br /><br />Starring: Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerrit, Harry Dean Stanton, and Yaphet
Kotto.<br /><br />Now, a lot of people say that the sequel &quot;Aliens&quot; is better.  I, personally,
think this is better.  Why?  Because this was just more fun.  I can't say
that before I've seen this I have ever seen a person spit white stuff (no,
perverts, it's not what you think).  This movie has a scary kind of feel to
it, that made an impression on scary movies (like &quot;Halloween&quot;).  I do think
that this is better than Aliens.  Better by a landslide?  No way.  Better by
a little bit?  Exactly.
