This was the best sci-fi movie ever thought up and produced. When it
first came out I was there. In the movie lobby the med techs were
working on a guy that had a heart attack while watching the film. I
thought holy cow, this must be a whopper. Was it ever! No other film
compares to this and it should have won Oscars for S. Weaver. She was
awesome and especially in Aliens. No other film that I have seen since
compares to the fright and jump out of your seat as this film produced.
I watch just about nothing else except sci-fi films and have seen so
many that this is the only one that brings great memories to mind. If
you have not seen it you should and the follow on ones too. There is
still room for more surprises.
