A great representation of our gritty and ruthless industrialized world in
the future.  Worn out and tired crew waiting to return home encounter a
deadly creature that leads to their destruction, all in the the name of the
comapnies greed.  Sound familiar?  Not too far from our world of today at
all.<br /><br />Weaver is magnificent, the scene where she flips out at Ash and slams him
against the wall is brilliant.  Holm was so convincing as Ash, the droid who
leads the crew to their destruction that I wanted to hit him throughout the
whole film.  And the rest of the supporting cast, such as Cartwright and
Skerrit pleading to be let back into the ship as the carry Cane with the
disgusting creature attached to him are great as well.<br /><br />A classic.
