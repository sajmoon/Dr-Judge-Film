2000_April 20 

It has been ten years since I saw &quot;Alien&quot; last -- I'm much more familiar
with the sequel which I watch at least two times a year. What I remember
thinking the first time I saw this film, back in the 80s, is that it was
boring. Well, that was a little unfair, but I was just thirteen or something
like that and sitting through a movie like this wasn't exactly what I
enjoyed. I enjoy &quot;Alien&quot; more now, but even though I don't find it boring
anymore, I can't help but feel that it is nothing compared to James
Cameron's &quot;Aliens&quot;. For instance, &quot;Alien&quot; is not nearly as suspenseful as
Cameron's film, the action sequences are lamer (can't blame Scott for that,
though, since his film is seven years older than Cameron's), and generally
much more happens in the sequel. I also feel that the chemistry between the
actors in &quot;Aliens&quot; are better than in this film. Naturally, though, &quot;Alien&quot;
is much better than David Fincher's third instalment in the series (and he
went on to make &quot;Fight Club&quot;, wow!) and also way better than the fourth
instalment. In short: it is a good film, but as far as the series go, this
is definitely one of those rare cases where the sequel is actually better
than the first film!
