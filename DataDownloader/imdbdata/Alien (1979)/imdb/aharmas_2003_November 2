In an era where spectacle and special effects have taken over, it is
refreshing to see a re-release of a classic.  When &quot;Alien&quot; came out in the
late 70's, it scared the hell out of me.  It was dark, scary, packed with
tension, and a realistic and horrid creature.  We had no time to worry about
words, but about the survival of the crew, and as if everyone knows by now,
chances of escaping were dim.<br /><br />Ridley Scott's directing job is probably his finest.  When we first wander
into the planetoid, we are fully transported there with a sense of
foreboding.  The place is unlike anything ever seen before.  There is plenty
of wonder, but it's also colored by the possibility of terror in its dark
atmosphere.  People might have criticized the screenplay for not developing
the cast enough, but that would have diverted the focus from the main story
line.  How do these people get out of this mess?  These are strong and
defined characters, but they don't have too many lines because they don't
need them.  The scientist for instance, works beautiful because it all
happens in his eyes.  We don't need to know or hear what motivates him. 
Ripley is a strong, silent, and direct heroine.  She is
fantastic.<br /><br />The alien rightfully earned its place in the classic monster pantheon.  Here
is a beast whose nature is not understood.  We witness its magnificient
design and purpose, but we don't ask too many questions.  It is beautiful
and horrifying, appealing to us in unexplainable ways.  We fear and admire
it at the same time.<br /><br />The new edition features a gorgeous remastering of the soundtrack, and one
can now fully appreciate the superb score.  It should be mandated that the
classics are released again in the big screen.  DVD's are wonderful, but
some films deserved to show their magic in the best possible
way.
