this movie absolutely sucked, I'm sorry they were on the ship most the time
doing nothing! the alien wasn't on screen much and you never got to see any
good killings. This has to be the most boring movie I've ever seen in my
whole freakin life, I give it a 2 out of a 10 only cuz Sigourney undresses
towards the end, but beyond that it just flat out sucked!
