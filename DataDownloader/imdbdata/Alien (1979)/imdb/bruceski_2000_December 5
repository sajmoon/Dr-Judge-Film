Alien is the best horror film ever made.  And outside of 2001 A Space
Odyssey and Star Wars, it is the best Science Fiction film ever made.  In
every respect -- acting, characters, dialogue, mood, music -- Alien is
flawless.  It also features movie-making's greatest monster.  One of those
films I could watch indefinitely.
