I enjoyed the heck out of this movie mainly because of the plot line.  I
have to say though that the acting is wonderful.  It set off James Cameron's
career and it is a good one.  I know he can direct very well and Sigourney
Weaver and Tom Skeritt are awesome.  Yaphet Kotto and John Hurt are very
cool in this.  The special effects are over the top. <br /><br />Overall this movie is way to cool and set off Cameron's career and the
wonderful sequel Aliens.  Too bad Jason X copied off of the entire movie. 
Rating 10 out of 10.
