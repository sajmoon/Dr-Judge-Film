In reviewing &#145;Alien', I want to say that this movie might have been better
for me to see, back when it was released in 1979. I only believe this,
because for some reason I could not completely get rapped up in it. That is
not to say I did not like some of it. However, as soon as part of me was
starting too really like it, I had an experience with this film that I found
unwholesome and frustrating, especially with the ending, a feeling that I
remember I had through another popular movie &#150; &#145;Fight Club'. It is a shame,
because the idea that Aliens are out there and are scary is totally
fascinating to me.
 <br /><br />The terror begins when the crew of the spaceship, &#145;Nostromo' investigates a
transmission from a desolate planet and makes a horrifying discovery &#150; a
life form that breeds within a human host. Now the crew must not only fight
for its survival, but the survival of all mankind.   <br /><br />Director Ridley Scott was and still is praised for giving us one of the
great horror/Sci-Fi classics. I was not in awe of this film, however I feel
I could have been. Scott's direction is one of the main problems with this
film. Firstly, the film is given a pace that for me is far too slow. I would
have preferred the film to have a quicker pace which would have increased
the tension. The other problem is the way that Ridley did not take full
advantage of the &#145;Alien' aspect to the film, especially with the ending that
we see Ridley present. But the fans really do make a big song and dance
about this film and the director is one of the reasons for that.<br /><br />Yet the story to this film is also guilty of being weak, even
underdeveloped. 
The screenplay was written by Dan O'Bannon, based on the story written by
Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, which does have merits I have mentioned.
But the story could have done so much more with the &#145;Alien' created. Also
whoever devised the ending to this film did a terrible job, as I found it
totally unsatisfying, bringing the film down for me. <br /><br />Some of the actors and characters in this film are very good. At the start
of the film we see the entire crew of &#145;Nostromo' awake. The ship is
commanded by Dallas (Tom Skerritt), who cares more for his crew than for the
actual space mission. Skerritt is pretty good as this character. Under
Dallas is female commander Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), who is a real find as
female action hero. Ripley has &#145;balls', and I get this feeling from Weaver's
performance. Ripley believes in following protocol, a big difference to
Dallas. <br /><br />Another interesting character is Ash (Ian Holm). With the discovery of this
Alien life-form, Ash is genuinely excited instead of scared which is the
reaction the rest of the crew give. What the movie reveals about Ash is
quite unbelievable, but very interesting. While what happens to scientist
Kane (John Hurt) might be a pretty ordinary demise, but another of the
film's great moments. <br /><br />The rest of the crew (or cast) is not so great. The other female crewmember
Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) is strange, as she does nothing more on this
ship, other than whinge and scream. But more annoying than Lambert, are the
two space engineers Parker (Yaphet Kotto) and Stanton Brett (Harry Dean).
This pair get along very well, suiting each other. These characters brought
nothing inventive to the film, and are very frustrating. Seeing all these
characters &#145;go' was a blessing, rather than upsetting in my view. <br /><br />I liked the &#145;Alien' effects that were presented here. The Alien creations
themselves were wonderfully done by the special effects crew (Carlo Rambaldi
and Bernard Lodge) and costume crews (John Mollo, H.R. Giger, and Roger
Dicken). Everything from the creation that looks part spider, part female
genitalia (which causes some of the great scary moments in the film), up to
the actual &#145;Alien' we see, which is gruesome, but in its own way very
attractive, were fantastic. This is one of my favourite areas of the entire
film. <br /><br />To be honest I first watched this film around 5 years ago, and was feeling
so scared, I had to fast forward the DVD. Since that time, when I put this
film on, I am waiting in anticipation for the movie to give me as much of
that &#145;scared' reaction as possible, as that is the feeling I desire as I am
watching it. But that experience is very limited in this film. So with all
these factors, I have to say I am disappointed in &#145;Alien' and do not agree
that this is a brilliant movie, in fact it is quite the opposite. What a
pity!<br /><br />CMRS gives &#145;Alien': 1.5 (Bad &#150; Ok Film)
