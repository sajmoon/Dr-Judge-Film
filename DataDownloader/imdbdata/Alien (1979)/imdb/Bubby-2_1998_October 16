WHAT AN INCREDIBLE MOVIE.  SOME MAY FIND THE BEGINNING A LITTLE SLOW HOWEVER
ONCE THE ALIEN IS INTRODUCED THERE IS NO STOPPING THE SUSPENSE AND THE
ACTION.  THE FILMING AND SPECIAL EFFECTS STAND UP EVEN TODAY EVEN THOUGH THE
MOVIE WAS MADE NEARLY 20 YEARS AGO.  A MUST SEE FOR SCI FI LOVERS
EVERYWHERE!!!  AND DON'T MISS THE EXCITING 3 SEQUELS THAT JUST GET BETTER
WITH EACH ONE.
