i must admit that i preferred ridley's original version compared to the
'director's cut' which graced our screens a few weeks ago. i always think
the best bits with sigourney in her underwear as oppossed to the infamous
chest exploding sequence which i always feel like after a curry. after
answering a distress call from the ship's computer; 7 crew members
investigate the possible s.o.s. only to find them themselves the
unwilling
victims to an horrific species more life threatening than george bush
jr.'s
favourite twiglet.
