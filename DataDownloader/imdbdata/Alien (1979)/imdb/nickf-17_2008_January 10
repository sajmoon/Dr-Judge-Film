Quite simply one of the greatest films ever made.. Years ahead of its
time in every way, concepts, script, acting, cinematography all combine
for an execution which is totally flawless...It started the greatest of
all movie franchises, malevolent, dark, scary, credible and visionary. <br /><br />H.R Giger&#39;s alien is magnificent, beyond reasoning hellbent on mindless
slaughter yet intelligent and cunning. A creature who&#39;s dark allure
still to this day holds our imagination and fear in equal measure. <br /><br />Next year the film will be 30 years old which I still find staggering,
Ridley has made a timeless classic, the visual presentation is as
sumptuous as any modern day sci-fi.
