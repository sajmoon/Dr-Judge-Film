This is realistic Science Fiction; arguing about bonus shares over coffee
and cigarettes in space.  If we start mining asteroids the people who go
out
there and do it will probably be like the characters from this movie.  It's
not only terrifying it's realistic. We don't see a polished, gleaming
spaceship we see a giant factory complete with dripping water, chains,
equipment scattered here and there.  It's human progress like we know it,
good but not always pretty.  And the Alien spaceship was incredible,
especially since the movie didn't bend over backwards trying to explain it.
You're left to speculate.<br /><br />Some of the best scenes:<br /><br />The Alien ship:  Dallas looking into the eye of the Alien Captain, turning
away, and the camera focusing on the skull for a second in the darkness.
Chilling.<br /><br />The Dinner scene:  One of the top-ten sci-fi moments.<br /><br />The conversations of Parker and Brett:   How the interstellar laborer views
management.  Way to develop the characters.<br /><br />Brett looking for Jones:  Scary<br /><br />Dallas in the shafts:  Even scarier, especially with the
music.<br /><br />Ripley and the alien:  'Nuff said.
