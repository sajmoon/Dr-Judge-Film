^^^^My favorite lines and death scene in the movie. Though I am 13 and
didn&#39;t see the original theatrical version, I got the directors cut and
watched it, and this movie amazed me(not scared, I&#39;m not scared
easily). I don&#39;t like the fact that it is very Gothic though like The
Shining, I couldn&#39;t see some stuff(death scene with Veronica and
Yaphet) but i could just barley make out what was going on. <br /><br />This movie (and War of the Worlds(the original)) was what brought the
thought of aliens and things living on other planets and brought other
great movies such as Independece Day.<br /><br />But it is certain to bring chills to you and to others maybe horror but
it will entertain you nether the less. ***1/2 stars of ****
