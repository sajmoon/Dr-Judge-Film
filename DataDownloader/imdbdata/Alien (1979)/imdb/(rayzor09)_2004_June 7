I'll keep this review simple.<br /><br />The movie is a great classic movie. It never seems to date. Ridley Scott
knew where film making was heading, and he gave horror movie fans from 1979
a glimpse of what the future would be like. Dazzling sets, tremendous
acting, and an awe-inspiring antagonist make this movie
memorable.<br /><br />But.<br /><br />Ridley Scott says the alien did not need to be seen. I highly disagree. The
alien terrifies us, therefore we need to know what the protagonist is up
against. The alien was obviously a man in a rubber suit. Aliens took the
special FX to another level, but still kept the action physical. The effects
in the next movie are far superior than this.<br /><br />In a nutshell: Rent the next one.<br /><br />7/10 Stars
