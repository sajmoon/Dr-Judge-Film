Forget Blade Runner. Ridley Scott&#x27;s screen gem Alien is the classic
horror movie that comes around maybe twice a decade. This is primal
fear at it&#x27;s most basic level.<br /><br />One of the best things about the movie was the fact that after the
first half hour, the camera never leads the Nostromo. The viewer is
trapped on the ship with the other seven crew members. Trapped with an
alien. An alien that begins to pick off the crew, one by one. Say what
you will about character development. Of the seven characters, all the
important ones have been developed as fully as they need to be. <br /><br />The beauty of this movie lies in it&#x27;s simplicity. There&#x27;s no
unnecessary details. Ridley Scott has done a wonderful streamlining
this script to the bare bones. With all erroneous detail gone, the plot
is focused on this one thing, the perfectly adapted killing machine
that is the alien. <br /><br />The set design is also brilliant. The ship&#x27;s corridors weave this way
and that, the crew seemingly eternally lost and alone, waiting to see
who&#x27;s next. The only one at home on this ship is the alien. It knows
the passages, and Laos in wait. The alien is the primal hunter, that
every human naturally fears, deep down.<br /><br />By appealing to the very basic element of horror, Scott creates a
masterpiece perfect for those wanting to be scared out of their wits.
Watch this movie alone in the dark. And hope the alien spares you.
