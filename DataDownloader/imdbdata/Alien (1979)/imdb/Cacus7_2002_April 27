&quot;Alien&quot; is the movie which started me down the path of sci-fi/horror fandom.
 This movie features a superb cast, excellent cinematography, a tight
script, and all the little extras which make for a truly memorable flick. 
Often imitated but never equaled, &quot;Alien&quot; is the original paranoia-in-space
story.  Tension builds throughout the movie until the end, and thrills are
never lacking.  I have nothing negative to say about &quot;Alien&quot; -- it is a pure
thriller.  If you have not seen this movie, rent it immediately.  This is
motion picture at its best.
