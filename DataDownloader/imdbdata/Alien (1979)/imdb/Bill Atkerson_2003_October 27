2003_October 27 

I must say that I'm generally a bit wary when I see ads for &quot;director's cut&quot;
or &quot;uncut&quot; versions of films, as this assumes the original was not as good
as it could have been, which is not always the case; e.g., the various
versions of &quot;Close Encounters.&quot;<br /><br />Anyway, without viewing the &quot;original&quot; just prior to seeing a preview of the
Director's Cut of Alien on Friday, Oct.24, 2003, I would have to say that
the Director's Cut improves on an already fine original movie. The changes
are subtle and not major in the least. For example, there is less of
&quot;mother&quot; the semi-clone of &quot;HAL&quot; from 2001 A Space Odyssey. This is a good
idea as computer technology in 1979, the original release date, was. ..well, it wasn't. And, of course, CGI wasn't an option for the special
effects, either.<br /><br />The result is, what seems to me, a much &quot;tighter&quot; movie that flows better
than the original. The actors, action, soundtrack, and visuals are
absolutely stunning, and seeing this movie on the big screen had a
tremendous impact on myself and my fellow theatre-goers.<br /><br />And then there are the zillions of kids who weren't around in 1979 who
should see this, too.<br /><br />Three thumbs up. . .go and have a rollicking good time
(again).<br /><br />
