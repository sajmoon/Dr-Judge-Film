Alien was a time breaker in society for films of the 70's. Unbelievable
was the special effects and the acting and the story line. You wouldn't
think possible of the 70's. But they had a perfectionist at hand, of
RIDLEY SCOTT. The photography is just of the planet for its age as is
the cinematography and acting. Alien is about a ensemble of people
returning to earth, and that is where the conflict arrives, they have
been awoken from hypersleep to check out this new planet which they
believe to have life of it. They will son find out if it does or not.
Siqurney Weaver is absolutely perfect for the part of 'RIPLEY' because
she is tough, strong and very agile. ALIEN deserves 10/10<br /><br />Paul............................... P.S HIRE IT
