This first film is by far the best in the series. It has everything: great
acting, a beautiful musical score, exciting suspense, astounding special
effects, superb filming, and so much more. <br /><br />Alien was a breakthrough for 1979. Many people think Aliens was better, but
you can't beat the first. This is one of the greatest thrillers ever made in
science fiction. <br /><br />Sigourney Weaver gives a show-stopping performance as Ellen Ripley. Yaphet
Kotto does extremely well also, as does Tom Skerrit and Ian Holm.<br /><br />Alien is a film we will never forget!<br /><br />Rating: 9 out of 10<br /><br />
