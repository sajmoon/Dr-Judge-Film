Alien is easily the best in the series of 
great films. While it doesn't have the action 
of Aliens or the cinematography of Alien 3 
and Alien Resurrection, the concept is what 
makes this film the superior. While technology 
will always make the chest bursters look 
more realistic or the aliens look more 
sinister, this film brought about a change 
in the genre, a &quot;milestone&quot; if you want to call 
it. H.R. Giger should have won an Oscar for 
set design. No creature looks more imposing 
than the aliens in this series.
