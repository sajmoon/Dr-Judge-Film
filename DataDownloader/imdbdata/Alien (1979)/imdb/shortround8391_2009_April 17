Alien....the creature......the film.....the legend. The one that
started it all, the one that led to one of the greatest sequels ever
made, one that got a comic book mini-series and 2 cross-over films with
&#x22;Predator&#x22;. This is THE film. And without a doubt, the greatest horror
film ever created, and this totally makes &#x22;Halloween&#x22; look like
&#x22;Chicken Little&#x22;. You can forget about all those rubbish &#x22;Friday the
13th&#x22; or &#x22;Nightmare on Elm Street&#x22; movies, &#x27;cause &#x22;Alien&#x22; just takes
horror up to so many levels! In &#x22;Alien&#x22;, we find ourselves in the
distant future with a crew just coming back from a haul of 20 million
tons of ore back to Earth. But while the crew members are in stasis,
their ship picks up an &#x22;SOS&#x22; from a nearby planet, and once the crew is
awakened, they are forced by the &#x22;Company&#x22; regulations to follow that
signal. And then when they land on the planet and it turns out that
something terrifying is in store for them, when a hostile organism
attaches itself to one of the crew members. And later on, it becomes
clear that the crew member was being impregnated and then dies a
horrible, violent death from a deadly breed of an other-worldly
life-form. And now the rest of the crew must fight off the creature.<br /><br />As other classic films should always have, &#x22;Alien&#x22; does great on the
characters. And of course, the most recognizable one is the lead woman,
Ellen Ripley who is played then-unknown Sigourney Weaver. She provides
a very human face and you&#x27;re gonna feel like you&#x27;re actually watching a
real-life woman in here, and it could be because of her accent, or her
mannerisms. But as the film progresses, she develops into a more
mentally tougher woman while combating the Alien. There are times when
she totally keeps it cool, times when she&#x27;s afraid, times when she&#x27;s
angry, and times when its just Ripley being Ripley. And thanks to
Weavers acting talents, she can really dish out one hell of a
character.<br /><br />The rest of the supporting cast are nothing short of spectacular,
Parker and Brett are the selfish, sarcastic men who only want to make a
profit. And through most of the film, you can feel the tension that
Ripley and Parker have. Lambert, who one of my favorites from here is
the second woman who happens to be the opposite of Ripley, a total
coward. Dallas, who the viewer might get the vibe that HE is the main
character in the 1st 15 minutes or so, is pretty much the leader here.
Kane, is the tired, dead-looking guy who is the one that carries the
alien species inside of him. And finally, Ash is the one with the
sinister purpose and you start to suspect that he&#x27;s up to no good at
some point. And movie characters need to have their own personalities
and that&#x27;s what &#x22;Alien&#x22; has.<br /><br />And as for the Alien itself, well what can i say? It is the most
horrifying creature in the history of cinema, period. I mean, how could
you stop it? It has acid for blood, and is very lethal to fight
face-to-face. And the special effects were over 20 years ahead of its
time. The face-hugger on Kane looked so freaking real, that you&#x27;re
gonna be scared just by looking at it, even it doesn&#x27;t do anything
except breathe most of the time. And the sets couldn&#x27;t have been
better, very futuristic, yet there&#x27;s always something ominous and dark
about them.<br /><br />The suspense is impossible to resist as the sequences deliver the
chills at times when you least expect it, and when you do expect
something to happen, nothing happens. And &#x22;Alien&#x22; is one of the very
few horror films that understands that you can&#x27;t scare people by raking
up the bodies and the blood, but you have to build up the suspense to
do it. And director Ridley Scott is such a genius, and he shows that
here, he absolutely knows how to make any kind of film, ones that can
scare (Alien), one that can sadden (Thelma and Louise), and one that
can excite/thrill (Gladiator). And Ridley really keeps up the dark
atmosphere, especially in the beginning when there&#x27;s no talking for the
1st 5 minutes or so, we get the feeling that something&#x27;s not right all
the time. Some parts are very quiet and very depressing and we feel
exactly what we see.<br /><br />This is the legend that I&#x27;m talking about here, folks. Don&#x27;t miss the
chance to see this, because it will scare the living daylights outta
you more than any other movie you&#x27;re gonna see in your life. Take my
word for it....I&#x27;m practically a movie buff, so I know what I&#x27;m talking
about....
