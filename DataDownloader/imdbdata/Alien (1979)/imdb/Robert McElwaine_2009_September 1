Often copied and inspiring countless knock off&#x27;s and direct to
video/DVD dross. Ridley Scott&#x27;s &#x27;Alien&#x27; is arguably one of the most
notorious sci-fi chillers out there. Now I know It&#x27;s very easy to jump
on the bandwagon and call select movies a classic and given It&#x27;s high
rating here on IMDb. I could be insecure enough to believe that there
is something sorely wrong with my personal taste in movies. But to be
quite frank I&#x27;ve never been able to appreciate what it is about &#x27;Alien&#x27;
that so many other fans adore. Indeed It&#x27;s exceedingly well directed
and the set design, production values are mesmerising and the Alien is
the pinnacle of inspired, visual terror. But while it Carred the tag
line &#x22;In space no-one can hear you scream&#x22;. A more fitting one should
have been &#x22;In space no-one can hear you yawn&#x22;. So why did I find this
picture to be such a monumental bore? Well, while the movies plotting
is a simplistic and It does deliver what must have been a genuinely
ingenious &#x27;shock&#x27; about a third or so in to the movie. It&#x27;s the
picture&#x27;s precision, lengthy slow pacing. A gimmick you could label it
I suppose. Utilised to crank up the tension as the crew members of the
mining ship Nostromo. Comprising of a cast of talented character actors
answering a distress call from what appears to be a derelict vessel on
a near by planet. Among the cast are the now legendary Sigourney Weaver
as the heroic, feisty Ellen Ripley who would go on to star in the
movies three sequels (Alien&#x27;s bearing the distinction of being the only
decent outing). And Tom Skerrit as Dallas who sadly didn&#x27;t quite have
the same success as his female co-star. But is arguably best remembered
for his career defining performances in &#x22;Steel Magnolias&#x22; and and the
deceptively cosy mid-nineties television drama series &#x22;Picket Fences&#x22;.<br /><br />When one of the crew Kane (The excellent John Hurt) descends in to a
chamber within the enigmatic space craft. He soon emerges from within.
With an arachnid like creature locked firmly to his face. Once back on
the Nostromo. Attempts are made to surgically detach the beast but to
no avail. As doing so would result in Kane&#x27;s death. When the creature,
unseen by the other crew members relinquishes It&#x27;s all too powerful
grip on the incapacitated member of the crew and It is revealed to have
mysteriously died. All seems to be well. Paticualrly when Kane awakens
from his short lived coma. But he or anyone else are prepared for what
is yet to come.<br /><br />It all sounds very well and good. And as said before, on paper this did
have the potential makings for what could have been a tremendous
exercise in nail biting terror. But with It&#x27;s lengthy exposition, and
all too heavy reliance on building up tension rather than relying on
more confrontational encounters with the menacing Alien of the title.
It fails to really be the roller coaster ride of emotion and fear that
the imperfect but superior follow up &#x27;Aliens&#x27; (1986) managed to be
thanks to James Cammeron&#x27;s talents as an action/sci-fi director and
screen writer.<br /><br />And while there is the odd flourish of inspired creativity which
include an eerie crawl through a labyrinth of air vents as the Alien
slowly but surely hunts down It&#x27;s prey, an ingenious twist which would
be expanded upon in the movies sequels and a final &#x22;surprise
confrontation&#x22;. It&#x27;s never quite enough to compensate for the abysmal,
tiresome monotony.<br /><br />I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not alone in my thinking as I write this review and
although I&#x27;m not alone in that thinking I&#x27;ll have to belong to the tiny
few who fails to comprehend what makes this such an iconic, cult
treasure. Each to their own I say. But just let me say this. At least
it also featured the brilliant Ian Holm as the cool minded, thoughtful
scientist Ash. Another fine actor that this film probably didn&#x27;t
deserve.
