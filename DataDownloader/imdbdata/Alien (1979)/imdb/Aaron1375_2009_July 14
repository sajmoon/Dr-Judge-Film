This movie is sort of like another science fiction movie that had the
same basic premise from the 50&#x27;s or 60&#x27;s, but this one really set off a
lot of alien movies and copycats from somewhat good ones, to a whole
bunch of bad ones made by the Italians and Roger Corman. Of course, of
the alien movies that are in this Alien series my favorite is Aliens as
that one was just totally cool. This one though is by far the best
horror of the four movies. Has great moments and great atmosphere and
has all the elements needed to be a great horror movie. Do not know
which I like better though as a horror movie this or John Carpenter&#x27;s
&#x22;The Thing&#x22; both being movies that can show others out there how to
make a good horror movie. This one has a mining vessel searching a
planet that has what appears to be some sort of alien vessel on it.
Writing this review now I can easily see where the video game &#x22;Dead
Space&#x22; got a lot of its plot. Well it is not to long that some sort of
alien lifeform attaches itself to one of the crew and refuses to let go
or to even let anyone tamper with it. That is okay it falls off and
dies in a bit and that is where the fun starts. I will not go into how,
but now stalking the crew of this mining vessel is one deadly creature
capable of killing nice and quickly. There are other parts to the plot,
but I do not wish to ruin them for those few out there that have not
yet seen this fine flick. The monster is done by costume for the most
part and it looks better than any computer monster done these days. So
for a complete horror experience try either this movie or The Thing.
