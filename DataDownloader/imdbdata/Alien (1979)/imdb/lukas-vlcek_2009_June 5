Flame gun and Alien. Fire and water. Light and darkness. I think the
problem of the last 2000 years is that these two principles were forced
to fight against each other. That is the main problem and I would also
say that it is a crime. The people who started last two thousand years
must have been out of their minds or they were not normal. Disoriented
in their souls and bodies - because these two things belong together.
Mother lesbian had a son gay? Who knows what crimes he must have done
that he finished nailed to the cross? What if all that is just a legend
made up just for church to be able to manipulate people. Instead of
clashing fire with water into a sign of two clashing lines - a cross,
these two elements should join into a new direction together, or into
more different directions at one moment, into a shape of a Jested
mountain in northern Bohemia. Have you ever seen the building at the
top of Jested? That is the shape of this solution. Instead of a clash,
blending together like two albatrosses. Two years ago I wrote a poem in
Czech inspired by Alien movie and in my mind I have put the flame gun
into the mouth of the Alien, so he can fight with freezing fire against
all vicious, insincere, and dangerous things that should not be in this
or any other universe.... Lookasch Weltcheque, EUROPE. CZ<br /><br />aquareaeous sataurnterra wettitanio enigmastyxgma darkest grapefruit
