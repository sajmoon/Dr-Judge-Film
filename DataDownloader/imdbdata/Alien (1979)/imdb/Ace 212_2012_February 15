&#x22;Alien&#x22; revolves around the story of a crew exploring space, that
happen to bring an unwelcome guest on board resulting in a
cat-and-mouse chase in which the crew members try valiantly to save
their lives. <br /><br />&#x22;Alien&#x22; was a ground-breaking film that set the standards for both
suspenseful thrillers and sci-fi movies. The film in itself may be
quite predictable at times and some people would argue that perhaps now
it isn&#x27;t as terrifying in comparison to other films, but it still
doesn&#x27;t detract from how innovative a film this is. Even now, many
moments in the film will have you on the edge of your seats with the
director bringing suspense to a new level, as well as some iconic movie
moments still considered as some of the best ever. The whole film is
brought together wonderfully by the acting, especially of Sigourney
Weaver, that really put you in their position, and the special effects
is also quite amazing for its time. <br /><br />Overall, this is a stunning film that should keep you entertained
throughout, despite its relatively simple plot. And though it may be
slightly predictable the impact of the film remains as hard-hitting as
ever, with this being the most advanced sci-fi horror of its time.
