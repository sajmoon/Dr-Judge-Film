Unfortunately, although the suspense is good, the climax where the alien
bursts out of Hurt's chest just doesn't work now. It is so obviously a
glove
puppet that it is more likely to make people laugh than scream. Likewise,
when it runs away, it's blatantly the glove puppet being pulled along on
wheels. After, the film is ruined.<br /><br />In space no-one can hear you laugh!<br /><br />See Aliens for a truly scary and exciting film that has not dated at
all.<br /><br />
