For 1979, this is 1 of the best sci-fi films ever, followed by a much better
sequel then a sucky 3rd one then a awesome 4th one. The alien effects were
great &amp; not computerized like in the 3rd one. the cast especially Weaver
does a superb job. the music is haunting 2. this is a must have if u r a
sci-fi fan.
