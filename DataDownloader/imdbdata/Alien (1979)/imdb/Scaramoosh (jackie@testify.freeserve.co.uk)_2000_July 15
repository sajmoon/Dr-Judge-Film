'Alien' is, and has been for some time now, my favourite movie of all
time,
so far.  Personally, I can't fault this film.  It's very frightening, the
tension which mounts through the film is incredible.  The direction is
excellent, the acting convincing, although Sigourney Weaver seems pretty
self-conscious at the beginning of the film, but I like it that she is!
The
music is excellent, the special effects fantastic considering when this
film
was made, and the script is top notch.  With most films, I might come away
saying, &quot;very good, except....&quot; and then name a flaw or two.  To me,
'Alien'
is flawless.  I've seen it countless times in the past (the first time
when
I was only 14 yrs old and too scared to watch the end!), but these days
about once a year is enough.  As far as sci-fi goes, it don't get much
better than this.
