What can I say? This is the JAWS of space movies. Although there is a 50's
monster movie, IT! THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE, which is the most directly
responsible for this film's insparation. Most of you already know the story,
about the crew of a cargo starship on their way home who recive what seems
like a distress call and head to a remote planet where they find a wrecked
alien ship containing hundreds of eggs and when one of the crew members is
infected, is brought aboard to have the parasite removed, eventually the
creature detaches itself and dies, the crew member wakes up apparently fine,
then an insect-like thing laid inside bursts out and quickly grows into a
monster...I don't need to say any more. But did you know that Ridley Scott
wanted a different ending, where the alien bites off Ripley's head and then
sends a message to earth in her voice? (See &quot;trivia&quot;.) How could such a fine
director come up with an idea like that? Aside from being an unhappy ending,
a far better reason to reject that idea is that it makes no logical sense
whatsoever. I know it's an alien and it's abilities would be shrouded in
mystery, but still, that would've been just too hard to swollow. Anyway,
this is going to be re-released on Halloween, 2003, with footage that was
cut from the original version, so it'll be interesting to check
out.
