Alien is the best &#x22;monster movie&#x22; of all time. It has all the best
aspects of a science fiction movie, a horror movie, and an action
movie, all wrapped up in one terrifying, heart-pounding slime-fest. All
the infamous Godzilla movies were men in suits, and they looked fake as
hell. A mere twenty years later, an up-and-coming American director
does the same thing will uncomparable results. I am not bashing
Japanese filmmakers in any way, but seriously, watch a Godzilla film
and then watch Alien, and tell me you can&#x27;t tell which is better.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver is incredible in this movie. She is perfect as the
bad-ass space heroin amongst a team of corrupt or otherwise incompetent
crew-members. She got an Academy-Award nomination for the same role in
the sequel, and even though I didn&#x27;t notice any difference from the
first movie, I still think she did a great job.<br /><br />Ridley Scott kept a perfect balance of suspense, action, and horror in
this film. Each kill took place in a dark corner of the ship and showed
just enough of beast to keep the audience scared. A flash of the head
here, a glimpse of the tail here, and then the unsuspected victim is
lifted off the floor and into the rafters where he is silently
dismembered and devoured.<br /><br />The Alien itself, though you don&#x27;t ever get a real good look at it
until the end, was expertly designed by H. R. Giger. What&#x27;s better than
an acid-bleeding, two-mouthed humanoid lizard monster that can crawl
through air ducts and across ceilings as quietly as a mouse. Nothing is
the answer. The Alien was played by an African tribesman named Bolaji
Bodejo, (those guys are deadly without alien makeup,) who was hired to
display the creature&#x27;s movements.<br /><br />Alien started the science fiction/horror genre and remains the best of
that genre to this day. Its induces in people a nostalgia for the
earlier great sci-fi movies like Star Wars and 2001: A Space Odyssey,
and for earlier horror films like The Exorcist and Night of the Living
Dead. But Alien remains one of the most influential movies from the 70s
and possible of all time.
