ALIEN received mixed reviews when it debuted in 1979--largely from
science fiction critics, who accused it of being little more than a
sort of Friday the 13th in Outer Space, a blood-and-gore horror flick
given a futuristic twist via special effects. But while these
accusations have more than a little truth, it has been an incredibly
influential film--and even today, in the wake of CGI effects, it still
holds up extremely, extremely well.<br /><br />The story is well known: the crew of an interstellar craft responds to
what seems a distress signal, only to encounter a remarkably lethal
alien life form that boards their ship and sets about picking them off
one by one. Some of the special effects are weak (the alien spacecraft
and the android &quot;revival&quot; are fairly notorious). There is little in the
way of character development, the film has a fairly slow pace, and the
story itself is predictable; you can usually guess who is going to die
next.<br /><br />BUT. The art designs are incredible: the entire look of the film, from
the commercial nature of the spacecraft to the iconographic alien
itself (brilliantly envisioned by Giger) is right on the money.
Director Ridley Scott encouraged his cast to ad lib from the script,
and the result is a shocking sense of realism--and the somewhat slow
pace of the film and the predictability of the story gives it a sense
of relentless and ever-mounting paranoia that is greatly enhanced by
the tight sets and camera set-ups. With its odd mixture of womb-like
organics and cold mechanics, ALIEN is a film calculated to send even
the most slightly claustrophobic viewer into a fit of hysteria.<br /><br />The entire cast, led by Tom Skerrit and Sigorney Weaver, is very, very
good--and the film abounds with memorable images and scenes ranging
from John Hurt's encounter with the alien egg to Skerrit's search of
the ship air ducts to Weaver's terrifying race against time as the ship
counts down to self-destruct. Seldom has any film been so consistent in
design, cast, direction, and out-and-out fear factor, and although
certain aspects of ALIEN are open to legitimate criticism the end
result is powerful enough to bring it in at a full five stars. A word
of warning, however: you'll need to send the kids to bed for this one.
And you'll probably be up half the night afterward yourself!
