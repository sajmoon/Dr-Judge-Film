I remember sitting in the theater watching &quot;Alien&quot; when it first came
out. It really gave me the creeps. What made it worse was I had the
strangest feeling I had seen this very same movie when I was a kid. It
took me almost two years for me to put my finger on it.<br /><br />While at a video store, I saw the cover of an old SciFi flick that
scared the bejeezus out of me when I was about 5 years old. The movie
was called &quot;It, The Terror From Beyond Space.&quot; Scott obviously saw this
movie and took those aspects that scared the pants off an five year old
and turned it into something that scared the pants off a twenty-five
year old (at the time).<br /><br />More than twenty years later, I still believe the two greatest SciFi
flicks ever are &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;It, The Terror Beyond Space.&quot;
