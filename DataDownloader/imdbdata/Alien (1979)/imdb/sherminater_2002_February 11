Welcome to one of the greatest sci-fi achievements of all time.  Scott
really came through with this film.  As opposed to his more recent
achievements(Black Hawk Down, Gladiator)this film is outstanding.  It is
kind of sad to think that he has only now gotten recognition for his
directing talent from those modern films.  In this film Weaver really begins
to make a name for herself becoming a bona fide hollywood star, and with
good reason.  The character Ripley is very easy to root for in these films.
Unfortunately only the first two films in this series are worth watching and
owning.  This film is a must see, very scary and great sci-fi.
