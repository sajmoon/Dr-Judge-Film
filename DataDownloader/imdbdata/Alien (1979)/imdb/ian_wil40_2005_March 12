I love this movie. It is very original, just the right amount of
gore,the viewer doesn't really get a good look at the alien until the
end. I love the classic chest popping scene..brilliant. Ridley Scott's
original masterpiece. This film should be viewed by all it didn't scare
me at all but its fun. Defiainatly Gothic horror, the dark cold moist
atmosphere really is what makes this movie scary. I highly recommend
this film to all. Blade Runner is another good film by Ridley Scott it
also has the same atmosphere as this film. Very good movie! See this
film!! Although if your not into these kind of movies stay away from it
because it might scare you or just gross you out.
