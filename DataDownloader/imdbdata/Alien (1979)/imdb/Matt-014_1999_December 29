1999_December 29 

ALEIN is in my opinion the best Science Fiction movie, ever. It is also by
far the best Sci-Fi-Horror movie. Ridley Scott did a wonderful job directing
this piece of work, and Sigourney Weaver did a great job as Ripley, who
seems to be more quiet in the beginning, and then turned into an Alien ***
kickin machine! <br /><br />This movie really scared me the first time I watched it. The environment
helped on that one. It was all so white inside that one room in their ship,
and you could hear the howling of the wind against their ship the whole
time. But when I got to the scene with the thing on Kane's face I got
totally freaked, and also when the Alien comes out of his chest. This
overall is an amazing movie, and the last scene with Ripley and the Alien
helped on that too. Now go and see this piece of work for yourself.
9/10!
