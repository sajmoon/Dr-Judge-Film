&quot;Alien&quot; follows the general conventions established by John Ford's &quot;The
Lost
Patrol,&quot; his highly influential 1934 work.  It's been redone any number of
times as a war movie or a Western.  Now it's in outer space.  The
sub-genre
looks something like this.  A small contingent of people -- a mixed
group --
in an isolated situation are confronted with a rarely seen enemy who
strikes
out of the darkness.  There is no way to fight back effectively.  One by
one, the group members are picked off, beginning with the leader.  This
shifts the responsibility to the next in command, who turns out to be the
lone survivor or, sometimes, the last to sacrifice himself or herself for
the sake of the mission.<br /><br />But it's hard to recognize the basic plot under all the gloss.  This movie
was something of a shocker on its release, and introduced a lot of
innovations into SF movies.  For instance, in all earlier movies in which
a
team lands on an alien astronomical body there is no wind.  Here, there is
a
howling gale.  This may not seem like much, stated so baldly, but no one
had
thought of it before, although it's long been known that planets like
Jupiter have atmospheres that are in a state of constant turbulence.<br /><br />The monster was also a vehicle for a new, slimier conception of raw evil.
This one is no Gill Man or furry pet with teeth.  This thing is positively
reptilian in its detestability.  And it doesn't just &quot;do away&quot; with its
victims.  It begins by incorporating every revolting image from our worst
nightmares -- a scaly muscular skate-like creature that plasters itself to
John Hurt's face and embeds itself in his innards in order to plant a seed
of some sort, which later develops into a juvenile that, in a famous
scene,
bursts out of Hurt's chest during a shipboard dinner that didn't look very
appetizing anyway.  This was the first movie that could really turn one's
stomach, what with jelly-like substances and gooey sounds.  Everything
connected with the alien looks as if it belongs under a rock in a jungle.
The f/x are outstanding.  If they look a little tired today it's only
because they've been so often imitated.<br /><br />The performances are professional all the way down the line.  Sigourney
Weaver has a strangely boney face and tiny mouth, but she's believable and
turns in a good performance, especially for a Stanford graduate.  Her
first
name was plucked by her father from F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, &quot;The
Great
Gatsby,&quot; one of my faves.  Tom Skerrit isn't around that long, but he is
so
likably easy-going that we hate to see him disappear from the plot early
on.
John Hurt is a fine actor.  He was my supporting player in the
art-theater
classic, &quot;From the Hip.&quot;  He's never done less than a first-rate job.
Whatever happened to him?  Veronica Cartwright exudes vulnerability.  She
needs protection as an adult as much as she did when she was a child in
&quot;The
Birds.&quot;  In an interview she revealed that when the juvenile creature
first
appeared everyone laughed at it because it looked so much like a penis.
Ian
Holm as the robot is suitably cold.  He's a good Shakespearian too.
Yaphet
Koto is an earthy comforting presence -- while he lasts.  The alien itself
doesn't have much screen time but makes the most of it, dripping all over
with what looks like saliva.  It reminded me of a boatswain's mate I once
had the misfortune to serve under.<br /><br />There are a couple of curious things that shouldn't get more than
footnotes.
The music is almost all taken from Howard Hanson, a moody and underrated
composer, and effectively evokes distance, darkness, and the mystery
associated with them.  There are also a couple of references to Joseph
Conrad thrown in (eg., the name of the ship is the Nostromo) for reasons I
can't figure out.  Maybe the writers or the director just happened to like
Conrad.  It should also be noted that Sigourney Weaver's figure, while not
bursting with femininity, is sleek and smooth and looks designed for
underwater swimming.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this, you should probably try to.  The gross factor
isn't very high, viewed from today's perspective, so if that's what you're
looking for, rent Carpenter's regurgitative newer version of &quot;The Thing&quot;
or
something.<br /><br />
