Alien is by far one of the greatest movies made. Directed by Ridley
Scott, you can tell by the eerie, bleak opening credits that your not
in for a pleasant ride.<br /><br />This movie starts out with introducing us to the crew of the Nostromo,
who are returning to Earth. Along the way they receive a distress
signal. They go and investigate and everything takes a turn for the
worst when a crew member comes back on board with a parasite attached
to his face. When the alien then breaks free all hell is raised.<br /><br />This is a great movie. The suspense is by far some of the best filmed
and the dark atmosphere heightens are sense of terror. Well acted by
Sigouney Weaver, Ian Holm and Tom Skerrit this is a genre defining
movie which holds to date one of the most shocking scenes ever filmed.
