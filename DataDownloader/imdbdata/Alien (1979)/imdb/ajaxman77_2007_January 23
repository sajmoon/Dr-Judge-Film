This film is too scary for me. I only saw it once, or maybe twice at
the most. I remember back in the early 1990s when it was on home video,
and I rented it with a few friends, and we watched it late at night for
a Halloween get-together, and we all were terrified so much that we
never went to sleep. To say that the sequel is better isn&#39;t fair. I
thought the sequel was lacking in suspense. I did like this one though,
even if I will never want to be that scared again. It scared me more
than the Exorcist. I guess it was too realistic for me. I think the
realism was so fantastic that it beats any other science fiction or
horror movie to a big medium. That&#39;s how scared I was. But its a good
film though, it really is.
