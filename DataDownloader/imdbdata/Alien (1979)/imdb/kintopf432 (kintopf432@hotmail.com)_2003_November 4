A chilly horror masterpiece.  There's a meaty concept at play behind the
spookhouse fa&ccedil;ade, a healthy--and slightly paranoid, in the best seventies
sci-fi way--subtext about not trusting corporate and government
establishments (here rolled into one in `the Company').  But mainly it's
just a clammy horror movie, as the simple but well-drawn characters fumble
around in the dark, alternately looking for the alien and running from it.
Ridley Scott's technique is elegant, but we don't see as much of the
stylistic polish (some would say pretense) here as we do in his later
work.
In this case, that's a blessing, as it gives the film an air of sweaty,
almost `Das Boot'-like realism largely absent from his florid recent
efforts.<br /><br />The `Alien' series has had quite a mythology grow up around it, and it
isn't
hard to understand why.  There isn't really another movie series quite
like
it, with each episode being guided by a different, competent and
completely
distinct auteur.  It is not a flawless series--there are those who find
`Aliens' too macho and thuggish, `Alien&sup3;' too black and misanthropic, and
`Alien Resurrection' too self-indulgent and empty (and, perhaps, too badly
acted).  But each film is so unique, and yet has so much in common with
the
others (the opening `wake-up calls,' the androids, the Company, and most
notably, of course, Sigourney Weaver's iconic Ripley), that it's safe to
say
there's been no more perfect genre series thus far.  This first film seems
to be the only one everyone can agree on, and I can see no reason to argue
with that.  9.5 out of 10.
