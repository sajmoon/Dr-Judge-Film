I'll keep this brief.  The Nostromo (the ship) is a major character in
this
film.  It provides a dark and sinister backdrop. Film this movie on the
Enterprise and it loses its punch.<br /><br />A very good ensemble cast.  Ian Holm is as menacing as the creature - i
wasn't sure which frightened me more.<br /><br />A sci-fi classic.  Is it the best ever?  I'm hard pressed to think of
anything better - maybe 2001, A Space Odyssey.
