1999_May 26 

I was too young to go see Alien in the theaters, so I bought the novel and
the rare photo novel and read them over and over again. I finally caught
the
movie on HBO in 1981 and it took me by surprise. All I dwelled on (I was
11
years old) was the stomach scene being so scary, but as the years went by,
I
started to appreciate the characters in the movie and the way the film was
directed. I will say this: Hollywood has never been able to create another
creature like Alien and they may never do it again. Alien gets an
&quot;A.&quot;
