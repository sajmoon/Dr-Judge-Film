It seems that &#39;Alien&#39;, or the entire mythos that this film started, has
a bad rep nowadays. Many people forget, with the recent &#39;AvP&#39; films and
whatnot, that the original &#39;Alien&#39; film was a glorious piece of cinema.<br /><br />I&#39;ve heard &#39;Alien&#39; referred to as a horror film, as well as a sci-fi
film. Well, I guess in its simplest form one could refer to it as a
genre film. However, &#39;Alien&#39; deserves much, much more than that. It&#39;s a
masterpiece of suspense. A Space Opera. A terrifying force and the
source of countless inspiration for films to this day.<br /><br />Like many &quot;Generation Y&quot; fans, I grew up on &#39;Alien&#39;. I think the first
time I watched it I was either 6 or 7. Although I can&#39;t pin-point the
age I was, the mark it left on me was unforgettable. For better or
worse, no other film would manage to rock my imagination and shock my
nerves so much afterward. The direction from Scott is masterful, as
well as the performances of the entire cast.<br /><br />What&#39;s interesting is that even though Sigourney&#39;s Ellen Ripley would
become the main protagonist for the films following, this film shows no
sign or bias to her character. Each actor has a chance to flourish in
this film, including a curious cat named Jones and the ship itself- The
Nostromo.<br /><br />As long as there are aspiring filmmakers intent on making thrilling and
suspenseful movies, &#39;Alien&#39; will always be a standard to look up at and
live up to. This film is a titan, a teacher, and a masterpiece that
defies all genre.
