The Alien saga, what more to say. Must be the most thrilling and chilling
sci-fi. movies ever made for an audience that see movie for the joy and
pleasure of it. I saw this the first time on television, since then every
image has been printed in my mind. From the opening scene to the entering
of
the Derelict and to the end, this must be said, are a nothing more than a
masterpiece. The actors should take the full responsible for also making
this movie a classic. With my favourite character Ash (played brilliantly
by
Ian Holm)
This is a must see, without doubt.<br /><br />Go see and enjoy it...<br /><br />10 out of 10....
