In today&#x27;s world of CGI blockbusters, you just don&#x27;t get the grittiness
that Scott presented us with anymore. From the cramped feel of most of
the scenes, to the use of miniatures and low tech ways he delivers the
tension. It is really sad that in today&#x27;s world most movies still
cannot touch Alien of even Aliens, 20 plus years on. I can still watch
this movie over and over and pick up something new every time. I
sometimes have to wonder if directors in the future may return to
shooting movies in this manner and revive an old art form, just to be
nostalgic. Or maybe one day when CGI is so good we can&#x27;t tell between
it and reality if they will apply an Alien type filter to there movies
to finish it off. All you have to do is watch Avatar to see what I am
talking about, don&#x27;t get me wrong I loved Avatar and it goes without
saying Jim Cameron is one of my favourite, for obvious reason. But
there is still something fake in the implementation of CGI movies.
Although I must admit Avatar to me was the first time since lets say
Terminator 2 that the line became really blurred without having to keep
reminding yourself it isn&#x27;t CGI.
