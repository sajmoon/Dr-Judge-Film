i saw the film yesterday night on spix at midnight as there weren&#x27;t any
good movie up in the television at that time and now i am thankful to
the media Chanel spix for that! the movie is great,but it seems to go
at a slow pace(probably because we are to much used to the fast pace of
life) but it delivers its message in the most beautiful way. the movie
teaches us that there won&#x27;t be any of the evil dwelling in us if we are
deeply associated with the best of the creations of nature. towards the
end of the movie we learn that how harm we are causing to this holy
place of ours.<br /><br />just think of a single thing which is not derived either directly or
indirectly from the nature! probably we won&#x27;t find any. and now think
of the times when you have been grateful to this nature(and not god for
that sake)for this beautiful life of ours or the way in which we have
given back to the nature for showering it&#x27;s gift upon us! this movie
teaches us to be grateful to each and everything in life and cherish
this beautiful life of ours without causing any harm to the other
creatures of this beautiful planet.GO FOR IT AT LEAST ONCE IN YOUR
LIFETIME! WISH YOU A GREAT DAY!
