going into this movie, i didn't have expectations of great acting or a
phenomenal script. i had never even heard of it or The Blue Lagoon
until a few weeks ago because people only talk about the really great
movies.<br /><br />i judge movies on how they make me feel deep down. this wasn't perfect
but if you leave all your expectations at the door, you'd be surprised
how much truth is there.<br /><br />it lets you enjoy innocence. i think that's why i could even accept the
fact that the performances weren't absolutely perfect. children aren't
supposed to be perfect, but they do have one thing over most adults, a
child of innocence will love unconditionally despite all the confusion
that can be found in the world-even on an deserted island. i think the
people who created this movie were able to capture that part of life
and so i have to approve.<br /><br />i watched The Blue Lagoon before this one and have to say, even though
this one is less explicit, it's even more enjoyable. both are worth
attention though.<br /><br />however, neither should be viewed by young children; they were given
their ratings for a reason.
