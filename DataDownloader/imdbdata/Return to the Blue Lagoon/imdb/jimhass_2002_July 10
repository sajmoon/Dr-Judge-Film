All right, that's a little over the top. But seriously, there is nothing
to
recommend this movie aside from the young forms of the two stars. I guess
for a hormone-challenged teen, there is deep matter here. I don't want to
discourage or embarrass the young, but they should get their kicks
elsewhere
than this slick, empty, meaningless movie.
