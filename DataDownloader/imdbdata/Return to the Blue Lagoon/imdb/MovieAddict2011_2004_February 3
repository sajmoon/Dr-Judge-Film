Cash-in on the smash hit original involving a new pair of teenagers
finding
themselves trapped on an island. I don't remember much about this film,
other than the fact that Milla Jovovich tries her best to form an early
career, and that it's an exact repeat--in all literal sense--of the
superior
original.<br /><br />Don't waste your time. Please.
