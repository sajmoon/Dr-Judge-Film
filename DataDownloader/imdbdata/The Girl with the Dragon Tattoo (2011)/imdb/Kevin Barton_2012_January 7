David Fincher is brilliant. I thought he had maxed his potential at
Social Network, but he came &#x26; did it again. Having not seen the Swedish
film or read the novel, this was a completely new story for me. &#x26; I was
blown away! Daniel Craig gives a solid performance as Mikael Blomkvist,
a disgraced journalist tasked with solving a 40 year old murder. The
supporting cast is excellent as well, in particular Christopher Plummer
&#x26; Stellan Skarsgard. But the real star is Rooney Mara, as Lisbeth
Salander, an emotionally damaged and unstable woman bordering on
insanity. In every scene, she owns the character. She&#x27;s fierce, wildly
sexy, and unbelievably authentic. She better get an Oscar nomination.<br /><br />David Fincher is known for his dark, edgy style &#x26; it shows in this
film. the cinematography is fine, but its the score that really shines.
Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross definitely produced a phenomenal score
that goes well with the film. Oh, and don&#x27;t let me forget the opening
credits! Amazing, one of the best.<br /><br />This film is R-rated for a reason though. There is quite a bit of
nudity and a particularly disturbing rape scene. Just be forewarned.
Overall, my favorite film of the year, just beating out Drive.
