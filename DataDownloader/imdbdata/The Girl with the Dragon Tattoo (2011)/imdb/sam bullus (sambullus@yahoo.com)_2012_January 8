There is nothing about this that needs to be seen on the big screen. I
was unaware of the content, knowing only that it was based on a best
seller.<br /><br />The movie is incredibly long and slow paced. The lead female is
unattractive and unlikable. At times the movie really dragged, then
something unpleasant would happen. It seems that some people think that
being cynical, controversial and bitter equals some higher artistry.
Not in my opinion. Its not exactly a thriller..in fact its painfully
slow. The final twenty minutes are very tough going.<br /><br />There is apparently some debate as to whether the following films in
the franchise will be made as the movie didn&#x27;t make much money. I
personally don&#x27;t care if they are made or not but I hope the makers
realise that some who saw this will flatly refuse to watch a sequel.
