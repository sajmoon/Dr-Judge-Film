first, it&#x27;s a really really good movie<br /><br />second, it&#x27;s absolutely useless with the only purpose to satisfy David
Fincher&#x27;s ego and greed for money and the all American need to own
everything.<br /><br />a remake just after two years of a fan/critics praised original? and
nothing is changed but the actors?<br /><br />the swedes speak English now, with some weird accent? authenticity???<br /><br />also the title character is seriously underdeveloped just like the
emotional connection with the male lead protagonist. <br /><br />I said its a really really good movie but hence the above stated
rating:3
