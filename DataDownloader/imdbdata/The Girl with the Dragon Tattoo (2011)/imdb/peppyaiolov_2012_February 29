If this film was made back in 2008 it would be a bomb, but is is
not...it is just a remake.I do not believe that they wanted to make
their version of the book .It shows that they are making their version
of the film also.The film is an Americanization of Lisbeth Salander and
specially of unique Noomi Rapace. <br /><br />This film is a living proof of the fast times that we live in.In the
last century Hollywood waited for 10-20 years before making a
remake.Now 3 years are enough for the &#x22;short memory&#x22; of contemporary
society.<br /><br />The good thing is that the film it proves something else. The good
story is priceless and people what to hear and watch it again and again
and again...<br /><br />In the center of the story and the books and the films is Lisbeth
Salander and she is a REBEL WITH CAUSE. Lisbeth unites Lilith, Medusa,
Nemesis and Persephone in one female force that will avenge the all
misogyny in the &#x22;man&#x27;s world&#x22;.<br /><br />You can&#x27;t not love Lisbeth ! She knows what she wants - to fight men
like a man.Compare Lisbeth to her SISTER IN ARMS Charlotte Gainsbourg&#x27;s
character in LvT&#x27;s &#x22;Antichrist&#x22;. LvT just needs better stories. In his
film the theme of &#x22;womans revenge&#x22; is taking place in allegorically
twisted garden of Eden, but Lisbeth is here and now. <br /><br />Lisbeth is image of the the hidden demonic woman side.In the world were
all the MALE REBELS are &#x22;without a cause&#x22; , boring and repeating each
other,the character of Lisbeth Salander is REAL, UNIQUE and SCARY.<br /><br />So the REBEL like Lisbeth SELL WELL!<br /><br />The American film is good , but is second.It is like &#x22;A Fistful of
Dollars&#x22; (compare to original &#x22;Yojimbo&#x22;) for witch Kurosawa wrote to
Leone: &#x22;It is a very fine film, but it is my film.&#x22;
