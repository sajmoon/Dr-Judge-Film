2012_March 3 
I admit, this is by far my favorite film of the year. And also one of
Fincher&#x27;s best work up to date, as far as I&#x27;m concerned. It&#x27;s not as
complex as The Social Network or Zodiac, but it is massively
suspenseful and well-crafted. It definitely deserved a nomination for
best adapted screenplay, but that&#x27;s a topic for later. The performances
are good all around, but the only one who truly stands out is Rooney
Mara.<br /><br />It doesn&#x27;t have an specific story, the entire movie is not about the
mystery, the entire movie is not about the relationship between Lisbeth
and Mikael, and the entire movie is not about Lisbeth or Mikael. But it
has a little bit of the three, and they all complement each other.
That&#x27;s what I liked the most about it. Of course, I won&#x27;t lie, the
highlight of the film is indeed Lisbeth. She&#x27;s such a bizarre character
it&#x27;s hard to not look at her. Mara shines in every single scene she&#x27;s
in.<br /><br />Part of the film makes you feel uneasy, yes. But that&#x27;s part of the
experience. And it all has a purpose. All that said, the film does have
it&#x27;s flaws. Mikael Blomkvist continues to be an uninteresting
character, which is mostly the book&#x27;s fault, and probably the movie&#x27;s
biggest flaw. This adaptation could&#x27;ve made him more interesting, but I
didn&#x27;t see anything different. It&#x27;s sad to see that both versions
failed at it; Daniel Craig gives a decent enough performance to try and
make up for it, but it&#x27;s certainly not his best.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Craig and Mara&#x27;s chemistry is captivating. The
cinematography of the film is beyond great, and Trent Reznor/Atticuss
Ross&#x27;s soundtrack is legendary. It easily trumps their work in The
Social Network. This film might be long, yes, but it&#x27;s fast-paced
enough to keep you interested at every minute. It&#x27;ll begin slowly, but
as it builds up, you&#x27;ll be at the edge of your seat.
