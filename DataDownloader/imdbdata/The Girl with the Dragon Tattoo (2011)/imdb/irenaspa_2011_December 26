How many people have seen a movie and then gone to read the book after?
Strange, isn&#x27;t it? After reading this book you don&#x27;t have a wish to see
the movie. Why? Because a book is great, better than any movie under
that name(it doesn&#x27;t matter if it is Swedish or Hollywood version). It
is one of greatest action/thriller novels ever written and one movie
can spoil all what you&#x27;ve seen in your imagination while reading that
book. Movie may disappoint you in many ways if you compare characters
from the book and those how David Fincher described them. It&#x27;s not the
same. I don&#x27;t want to tell you anything about the book..., but you have
to read it!
