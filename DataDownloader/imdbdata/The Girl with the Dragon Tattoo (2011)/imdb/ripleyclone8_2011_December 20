I&#x27;ve never read the books or seen the original Swedish film but all I
can say is that it had a decent story and the acting was superb. David
Fincher did a great job molding this piece together. It wasn&#x27;t terrible
but it could of obviously been more. <br /><br />I sat through a 2 hour and 45 minute movie that was fairly slow in pace
and very inactive. It had interesting and captivating moments but it
really wasn&#x27;t something to kill over. Honestly, if you have never read
the book OR seen the original Swedish film than I can fully say as an
audience member you can pass on this one. <br /><br />Wasn&#x27;t terrible, it wasn&#x27;t excellent, just a standard film that isn&#x27;t
something I would go crazy over.
