Just to be quick and get it out of the way, Rooney Mara did an
outstanding job as Salander. She surpassed my expectations and put any
doubts I may have had about her to rest. She did a better job than
Noomi Rapace and Rapace delivered an incredible performance to begin
with. She definitely deserves the academy awards best actress nominee
if not the award itself because she carries that movie from start to
finish and it was breathtaking to see her do a complete 180 from her
earlier roles. She is not playing Lisbeth Salander, but rather, she is
Lisbeth Salander. <br /><br />Despite minor discrepancies from the book&#x27;s plot, the changes that were
made worked if and only if you are not a picky fan that cannot have
anything changed at all. I will admit the first half hour is a little
slow especially to the general audience but that does not detract from
the rest of the movie. Being in a full theater, everyone gasped,
clapped, cheered, laughed, and even cried at all the pivotal points of
the story. Everyone I have talked to and based on people&#x27;s reactions in
the theater, they all felt attached to Salander which again reinforces
my best actress winner.<br /><br />Go watch this movie because it truly is &#x22;the feel bad movie of
Christmas&#x22;
