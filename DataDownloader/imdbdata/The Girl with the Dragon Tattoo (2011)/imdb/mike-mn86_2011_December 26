I really liked this movie, had no idea what the story line was or
anything about the movie other than my wife read the books. I think the
job Rooney Mara did was amazing. I want them to develop more movies
based on Lisbeth - was a great performance. Daniel Craig was as good as
he has been in the other movies I have seen him in. Story line had me
dying to find out what was going to happen next. The rape scenes were
about as haunting a scene as I have seen in some time. Lisbeth was
determined, tech savvy, strong, resourceful, but very human and didn&#x27;t
fall into the &#x22;superhero/unstoppable special agent category. The 158
minutes went by quickly and I am dying to see more of the story unfold.
I hope they develop the next two books and more.
