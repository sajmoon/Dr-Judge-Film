A German company that sells American movies, mostly Hollywood, has
coined the slogan &#x22;Hollywood macht gl&#xFC;cklich&#x22; -- &#x22;Hollywood makes you
happy&#x22;. The truth though is that &#x22;Hollywood macht s&#xFC;chtig&#x22; --
&#x22;Hollywood gets you addicted&#x22;, and in my case on remakes. Which really
distinguishes me from the average Hollywood fan-chick... Argh.<br /><br />Craving for a hit of the evil drug I bought the DVD of &#x22;The Girl with
the Dragon Tattoo&#x22; and watched it. That was last week.<br /><br />Just now I found the DVD on a heap of books, looked at the title and
the cover and for a quite a long moment I had no idea what this movie
is about. I wasn&#x27;t even sure if I&#x27;d already watched it. But yea, I
remember now, I did watch it. I faintly remember Rooney Mara&#x27;s talent
wasted on some boring and embarrassing (at the same time!) table-dance
moves, the screaming chick from (highly entertaining, cult classic,
imo) &#x22;Beowulf&#x22; being a highlight, and yea, Daniel Craig was in the
movie, too. Had the lead role. And that&#x27;s all I remember.
