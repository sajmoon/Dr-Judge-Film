A couple of years ago, I did hear the audio books (Stieg Larsson
Trilogy) and those are some of the best thrillers I ever read (or
heard). At that point in time, I thought, that it would be very
complicated to make o movie out of this books, since there are awfully
much parallel event chains and it would be hard to put that into an 2h
movie.<br /><br />The first try to make movies out of the books was a European venture,
starring Michael Nyqvist tried it and partly failed. Those films are
good, but hard to watch for all not familiar to the books. They try to
tell everything and basically partly fail to do that.<br /><br />When I learned, that a US production started, I had some hope, that the
chain of events would be reduced. US movie makers know how to structure
a script well. I went to the cinema and I found more or less a remake
of the European movie. Sure, the cast is a bit better, but overall it
is not a substantial gain. It is still very long, partly painful to
watch (even for the younger girls), partly extremely violent and
treating all parts of the book equally. It results like the first try
in a movie who tries to explain everything, but not even achieving to
tell the central story well.<br /><br />No, I will not watch the sequels<br /><br />Mick
