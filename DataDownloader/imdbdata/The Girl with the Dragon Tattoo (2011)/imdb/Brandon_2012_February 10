This movie was beyond fantastic, truly a well made film which let&#x27;s
face it, may be hard to come by often these days. Daniel Craig who
plays the main role does so in such a thrilling manner as well as
Rooney Mara who had me convinced she&#x27;d lost her marbles. From a
cinematic point of view, it was directed by one of the best thriller
directors out there David Fincher who redefined the gory twist
completely with the 1995 film Se7en. Fincher made the audience
compelled to watch to see what happens next. Although a negative point
would be that the film starts slowly and holds that pace for a while,
but if you stick with it you will no doubt be more than satisfied (
because it does &#x22;speed up&#x22;). I can honestly say that this film is a
must-see but if blood &#x26; gore, violence , substance use and/or graphic
sex scenes/nudity tend to bother you, i would undoubtedly advise
against this movie. If you feel you can take it, you are in for the
ride of a lifetime. I recommend this movie 110% !
