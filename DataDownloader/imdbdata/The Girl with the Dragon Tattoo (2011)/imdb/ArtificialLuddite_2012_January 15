Last night, I walked into The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo fostering a
number of prejudices. I couldn&#x27;t understand why David Fincher would
direct a remake of a bestselling novel. I scoffed at the idea that
Americans are afraid of subtitles. I sighed impatiently after realizing
that the running time was two hours and forty minutes. I ended up
enjoying the Hell out of it.<br /><br />As the opening credits explode on screen, Fincher sets the tone for
what is a brutally confident and visually aggressive thriller. Peter
Bradshaw of The Guardian says, &#x22;Nothing in the movie quite matches the
terrific opening sequence,&#x22; which pounds its way into your head through
its use of a &#x22;nightmarish, amorphous vision in liquid monochrome.&#x22; What
transpires next is a rather even-handed introduction to a trilogy based
on the characters of Stieg Larsson. Sure the movie has its flaws &#x96; like
why does Daniel Craig keep his English accent, or the clich&#xE9;s and
scenes that almost drag the film down a number of dull meanders &#x96; but
it is the malevolent and at times perverse intensity that etches its
way into your mind long after the film is over.<br /><br />Rooney Mara is Lisbeth Salander, a vulnerable private investigator and
hacker who becomes involved with Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), a
discredited journalist hired to uncover a murderer in a wealthy feuding
family. The pair are brought closer together by the sinister secrets
that begin to unravel after Lisbeth cracks a mysterious code.<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo features a number of solid
performances, from the conflicted Mara and cardigan-wearing Craig, to
the array of memorable characters such as Lisbeth&#x27;s vile guardian or
Mikael&#x27;s distant wife.<br /><br />Also, following their Oscar-winning collaboration on The Social
Network, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross are back with yet another
menacing hard-edged score, as violent synthesizers rumble. The film
opens with a soaring industrial cover of Immigrant Song by Led Zeppelin
(as heard in the popular trailer for the film), with Karen O&#x27;s voice
giving it a distorted exposure during the slick silver montage.<br /><br />Even when it really slows down, the movie never drags, and at least you
can get a good look at a sickly world inhabited by cyberpunks, twisted
Germans, ferocious degenerates and Daniel Craig in spectacles. A very
powerful first move by Fincher, who gives this remake some brutal
purpose.
