Does the international sensation The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo live
up to all the hype? In my estimation, no! There is no denying that the
story is amazing. The book may be amazing, and the original Swedish
version of the film might be equally amazing, but David Fincher&#x27;s
adaptation of it is not. From the very beginning it seems as thou he&#x27;s
trying to turn this story into something it&#x27;s not, a sequel to Seven.
The story is fantastic, however, there are so many odd names and so
many mumbled lines thrown at you so quickly, that you&#x27;re easily
confused. At many points in this film I was confused, and even when the
killer was revealed, my reaction was &#x22;which one is that?&#x22; Besides being
confusing, the film has about an hour of footage that has nothing to do
with the main story and just adds to the overall confusion of the film.
Like I said, the story is really good, the actors were really good
also, but the film was just very long and confusing, and to be honest,
I really wasn&#x27;t all that impressed by it.
