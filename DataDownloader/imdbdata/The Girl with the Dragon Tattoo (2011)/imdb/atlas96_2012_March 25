The Swedish film was more visceral and grisly. I see that as a neutral
element in the comparison of the two, which shouldn&#x27;t really exist but
does. Anyway with exception to a few minor plot ideas that is the main
difference in both movies, disregarding that, this movie is very good. <br /><br />The atmosphere itself, presented in Finch&#x27;s dark and stylish
cinematography usual to his movies is a testament to the use of digital
camera-work. Fascinating is the modern feel and brisk pace presented
and dispels any notion that digital is another death in cinema. This
dark, cool style was also used in the recent Drive which was really
suburb. Both also used the tech-no beats that support the quick action
the way no generic melodies or tunes really could. Another comparison
in style is between once again the Swedish and American versions. The
Swedish felt more raw, lending to its brutality. This had a certain
hyper-realism about it that is also common in Finch&#x27;s movies. <br /><br />Moving into the heart are the characters the style and story revolve
around, and are quite notorious at this point. Lisbeth Salander has a
brilliant amount of depth to her that is truly rare. While I find the
books to be not particularly well written, I must give credit to the
author for creating a character with complexities that are well worth
discussing. Her life is full of deep emotionally scarring tragedy as
are most of the women in this movie. <br /><br />The story itself is a traditional mystery with a dark and unnerving
atmosphere. In truth the basis of the plot, while interesting, is
really simple, making the real interest and complications lie in the
characters themselves. This isn&#x27;t really a problem however, as said
before the mysteries regarding the leading lady are fascinating, and
Daniel Craig is a respectable enough journalist/detective. The
notorious rape scenes are brutal but yet toned down slightly for the
American audiences, which is understandable given our trigger finger
ratings board. <br /><br />The only real problem I had with the movie itself was during one of the
sex scenes, (voluntary, not rape) Lisbeth lets the man get on top
halfway through. Why would a woman, who was raped recently, possible
molested as a child, and treated awfully by men on a regular
basis,relinquish dominance in sex? This bothered me for a while
throughout and seemed inconsistent with the rest of the characters
actions. Despite this minor character flaw, it really is and excellent
work. In fact I could see this being a far better series overall than
the Swedish trilogy, the endings slow release as characters settle and
move on lends greatly to a transition to a sequel. Say what you want
about the Swedish version, but it worked far better as a singular piece
rather than a series and the following movies felt slightly disjointed.
I have doubts of that in this case, and hopefully, the second will have
the same visceral brilliance this one maintains throughout.<br /><br />Certainly worth mentioning is the fact that this is a remake, which
inherently loses credit by nature that it is&#x27;t a completely original
work, however well made it really is. It is however a very good remake,
and unlike the remake of let the right one in, it never simplified
already obvious plot points or removed uncomfortable things altogether.
For that, and the the performances which earned well deserved praise,
it should earn respect as an independent piece.
