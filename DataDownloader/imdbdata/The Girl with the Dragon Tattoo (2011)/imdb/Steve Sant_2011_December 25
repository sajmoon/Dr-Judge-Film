I came across an interesting review of the Swedish version of &#x22;The Girl
with the Dragon Tattoo&#x22; here: http://4thdimensionfilms.wordpress.com/
The Swedish version is less annoying than the American version which
unfortunately is formulaic. The review I read is spot on in reviewing
character analysis and other artistic aspects. The American Dragon will
undoubtedly appeal to newbies to the trilogy or those who don&#x27;t like
the pacing of foreign films. Still the Swedish original is usually the
best place to start and the review that I suggest could get many more
people interested in bothering to see the American version or even get
people to take another look at European and other foreign films which
are currently experiencing a renaissance. This will provide a good
synopsis: http://4thdimensionfilms.wordpress.com/
