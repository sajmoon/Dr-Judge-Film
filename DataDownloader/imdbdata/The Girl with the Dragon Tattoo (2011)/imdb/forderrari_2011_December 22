ALERT: THERE IS CURSING, NUDITY, SMOKING, AND A FAST MOTORCYCLE.<br /><br />GO SEE IT!!<br /><br />I know about the books. I know about the Euro-films. I paid no
attention to them.... I went in cold, wanting an unbiased opinion to
the Hollywood version.<br /><br />1) Craig played this roll brilliantly. His 007 &#x22;stereo-typing&#x22; is no
longer in question.<br /><br />2) This flick is l-o-n-g. 2.6 hours. Yes, my butt told me it needed
shifting. But, this flick kept me wanting more, and I got it.<br /><br />3) Thinking. There are places in this flick where you must think on
your own, making your own conclusions. I love this in a drama, I get to
play a part, I&#x27;m also an investigator.<br /><br />4) Next: THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE. This is a trilogy, ya know.<br /><br />5) Get the LARGE popcorn.
