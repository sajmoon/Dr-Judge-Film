From the terrifying , but fertile mind of Stieg Larsson, arrives this
unusual, dark Gothic story from which the strange black novel was
created. Having read the book, then seeing the visual adaption, one can
see why director David Fincher did not adhere too closely to the
murder/mystery story. This is one of those interesting films which
attracts you because of the main star, Daniel Craig who plays disgraced
novelist Mikael Blomkvist, then entertains you with scenes which are
not for the faint of heart. The story begins as a film of a writer who
writes an expose on a wealthy individual and fails, only to have
himself dragged through the courts and ruined. He is soon recruited by
a wealthy industrialist who hires him to write a biography of his
strange family, and in doing so, to investigate a 40 year old mystery.
When he needs help Mikael employs a superb cyber hacker who furnishes
him with information which takes him far beyond where he began.
Although a mystery movie, the film becomes a journey through a
nightmarish world of intrigue and murder. Rooney Mara is superb as
computer hacker Lisbeth Salander. Christopher Plummer and Stellan
Skarsg&#xE5;rd and Martin Vanger add mystery and intrigue to an otherwise
great movie. Indeed, in time this could very well become as Classic!.
Well done. ****
