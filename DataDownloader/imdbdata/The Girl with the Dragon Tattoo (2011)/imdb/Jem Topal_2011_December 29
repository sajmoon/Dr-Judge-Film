The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is chilling, haunting and relentlessly
thrilling. This is everything fans of the books could have hoped for.
David Fincher, arguably the most talented director of his generation,
is different in every way. It&#x27;s a tour de force of excellent writing,
directing and acting. You will either love it or hate it. <br /><br />You could say I&#x27;m biased towards David Fincher - I stand that he and
The Social Network were robbed last year of the best director and best
picture Oscars respectively, and I count Fight Club among my all time
favourite films. Even though I had read the book and knew pretty much
every major plot point, I still found myself getting sucked into the
story. I was watching this film late at night, so naturally there was
going to be a lot of sound; people on their phones, having
conversations and so on. However, when the film was cross cutting
between the two main characters before they met, they started to shut
up and concentrate, it was basically that good. <br /><br />The opening credits were very sleek, very stylish, and very David
Fincher. The cinematography was just brilliant; it&#x27;s just visually
great to watch. Fincher&#x27;s attention to detail to the source material is
practically Kubrick-like. The soundtracks in the film was nothing short
of magnificent, they were constantly setting the mood and atmosphere of
a scene. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross create perfect, eerie and
unsettling music. It is as good as their Oscar winning score last year
if not better. Fincher manages to reach a whole new level of art with
his version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, his vision to the books
is the same way i saw it, especially with the characters. Rooney Mara
is an amazing Lisbeth Salander she is the next Natalie Portman. She
does more with one look than the entire cast of Twilight have through
four entire films. Daniel Craig did a superb job as the charismatic
Mikael Blomkvist. Robin Wright was excellent as Erika Berger. Stellan
Skarsg&#xE5;rd a totally terrific Martin Vanger is just wonderfully
demented. Christopher Plummer nails the sad, mourning old man. Then
there&#x27;s Yorick van Wageningen that&#x27;s just downright despicable as Nils
Bjurman. <br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is obviously not for everybody. It
relies on extremely long discussions to drive most of the two and a
half hour duration of the film, and very graphic scenes where some
people might be too uncomfortable with it - i had no problem with that.
With a phenomenal cast, incredibly rich cinematography, a brilliant
score, and Rooney Mara&#x27;s best performance to date, The Girl with the
Dragon Tattoo is not only an improvement over the original but easily
one of the best films of the year. This is must watch. <br /><br />10/10 &#x96; Masterpiece
