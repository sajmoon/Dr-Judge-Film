If you saw and liked the original Swedish film based on Stieg Larsson&#x27;s
novel &#x22;The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,&#x22; you might be pleased or
disappointed with David Fincher&#x27;s English-language remake for the same
reason: this is a pretty straight-forward remake with few surprises for
fans of Neil Arden Opley&#x27;s 2009 adaptation of the same material. Even
the leading players, Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, seem to have been
chosen because of their resemblance to Michael Nyqvist and Noomi
Rapace.<br /><br />Despite its familiarity, I found this version as engrossing as the
first with the cast more than equal to the challenge of bringing these
characters to life. And if you&#x27;re looking for a great insult to direct
at an enemy, the phrase on Mara&#x27;s T-shirt in one scene is a masterpiece
of raunchy perfection. I think Leo the Lion, M-G-M&#x27;s mascot, may have
read it, too, which could explain why his roar was silent for a change
when the company logo appeared on screen before the movie.<br /><br />Be sure not to miss the opening titles which reminded me of the opening
of a Bond film as it might appear in a nightmare.
