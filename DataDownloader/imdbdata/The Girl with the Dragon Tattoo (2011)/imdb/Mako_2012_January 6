I had no idea what this movie was about. I remember seeing a short
preview, and thought it looked interesting. My family saw this on
Christmas Eve, instead of watching Tom Cruise in MI4. I seriously wish
I had voted for Tom Cruise. At the end, there was the most awkward walk
out of at the end, because everyone shuffled out in total silence.<br /><br />This movie only has an R-rating, but that should be put into
perspective. <br /><br />The first R-rated movie I ever saw was &#x27;The Faculty&#x27;. My cousin and I
were 12, and we convinced our Grandma that our parents totally said we
could watch it (they didn&#x27;t). It was a little scary, and I think there
was some shadowed nudity and decapitation. We had so much fun!<br /><br />&#x27;Dragon Tattoo&#x27; is way more intense. Way more. I&#x27;m 24 now, and I was
incredibly uncomfortable watching many of the scenes in this movie. The
content is challenging as a topic, but the gruesome depiction is so
much worse to deal with. You can&#x27;t just turn it off and walk away. If
some of it had been left to the imagination, I would have been much
happier, and the story would not have suffered, in my opinion.<br /><br />To sum up:<br /><br />1) This movie is not going to be enjoyable for children (and some
adults).<br /><br />2) If you can get past that, the acting is good and the story is
interesting.<br /><br />3) If you can&#x27;t get past that, but you still really want to see it,
wait for it to come out on DVD/netflix/redbox, and just fast-forward!
