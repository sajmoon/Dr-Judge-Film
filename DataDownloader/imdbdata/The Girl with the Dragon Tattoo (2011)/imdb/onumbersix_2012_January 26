A Swedish cinematic trilogy which was a great hit in its country and we
can understand why. Americans feel obliged to remake these foreign gems
with often unfortunate results, but not this time. My state of mind
after seeing this film in one word: WOW!<br /><br />An extraordinary film on so many levels. A mysterious modern whodunit
in which the story is peeled away one layer at a time, without
revealing the rest to come. An almost futurist thriller, where the new
information technologies are center stage. An imagery of reality in the
raw. Complex and vulnerable characters. Fast paced action which keeps
you riveted to the screen for more than 2 hours. And what can be said
of this resilient character, Lisabeth, the girl with the dragon tattoo
who dominates all her scenes in a role which surely will mark cinematic
history for years to come, no less. Even Daniel Craig earns my kudos
for his role. There are so many ways to appreciate this film that I&#x27;ll
probably go back for a second viewing while it is still in the
theatres. It&#x27;s really that good. Six weeks after its release and the
theatre is sold out, a rare feat nowadays. Truly a standout film.
