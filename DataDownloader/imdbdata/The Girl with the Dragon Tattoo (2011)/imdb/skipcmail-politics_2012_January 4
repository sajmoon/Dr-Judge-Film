I highly recommend passing on this garbage. It lowered the bar even
further for an industry that continues to demonstrate NO morals or
integrity.<br /><br />This movie was well made. The actors did a great job. But, this movie
was the most vile, despicable, and disgusting piece of work I have ever
seen. It attacked religion, portrayed adultery as normal and OK, and
displayed true X rated sex in an R rated movie. If it had been labeled
correctly I would have chosen NOT to have seen it. Watching one of the
key players sodomize another human was a disgusting act that
demonstrated the values of those who produced it. I wish I could erase
the memory of it and I will be seeking legal redress the trauma it did
to me.
