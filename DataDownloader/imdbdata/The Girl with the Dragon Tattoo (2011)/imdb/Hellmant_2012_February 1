&#x27;THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO&#x27;: Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br /><br />David Fincher&#x27;s English-language adaptation of the popular Swedish
novel &#x27;Men Who Hate Women&#x27; by Stieg Larsson, the first in the
&#x27;Millennium&#x27; series trilogy (which were first adapted in to films in
Sweden in 2009). Fincher&#x27;s remake stars Rooney Mara in the lead role of
Lisbeth Salander, A.K.A. &#x27;the girl with the dragon tattoo&#x27; (which is a
performance she&#x27;s received an Academy Award nomination for), and Daniel
Craig as Mikael Blomkvist. The screenplay was written by Steven
Zaillian.<br /><br />The story in this first chapter revolves around journalist Mikael
Blomkvist taking on a missing person&#x27;s case in which he&#x27;s asked to
travel to a remote island and solve the disappearance of his employer&#x27;s
niece, who went missing over 40 years earlier. Blomkvist just had his
reputation tarnished by a corrupt businessman and is looking to clear
his name, which his new employer, Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer),
promises he can help him do (if he works on his niece&#x27;s case). Mikael
believes the disappearance of Vanger&#x27;s niece has to do with a series of
serial killings and enlists the help of a computer hacker (Lisbeth
Salander, who was hired by Vanger to research him) to help him catch
the maniac.<br /><br />I&#x27;d rate the movie about equal with it&#x27;s Swedish counterpart. Once
again I loved elements of the movie and really wanted to love the
entire film but found it just a little too long and dragged out.
Fincher&#x27;s directing, editing and entire visual style is once again
superb, Mara is outstanding and the score (by Trent Reznor and Atticus
Ross) is mesmerizing but the pacing is just a little too slow (at least
at times). Probably due to the filmmakers once again staying just a
little too faithful to their source material. Lisbeth Salander is an
all time classic 5 star action heroine role though and I look forward
to seeing more of her in future American adaptations.<br /><br />Watch our movie review show &#x27;MOVIE TALK&#x27; at:
