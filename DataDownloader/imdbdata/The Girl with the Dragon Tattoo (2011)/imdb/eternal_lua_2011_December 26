If you are going to watch The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo film, watch
the Swedish version that came out in 2009. The Swedish version is much
better, with a good plot development and character development. If you
go for the U.S. version expect to be bombarded by Coca-Cola and
McDonald product placement. It&#x27;s pathetic that U.S. audiences have to
endure all this advertising. The U.S. version also seemed to add all
the very violent and sexually-exploitive scene without developing the
plot. The Swedish version has better suspense. Also the U.S. version
did a horrible job of developing the story of Harriet. In the end I
can&#x27;t believe I paid money to see this movie again, as the U.S. version
was truly of lesser quality than the Swedish version. Also the U.S.
version was a bit less gory and sexually explicit.
