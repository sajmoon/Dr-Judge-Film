Here is a rundown of the differences in the two movies:<br /><br />-MIKAEL BLOMKVIST-<br /><br />American - Blomkvist is played as more of a tough guy and not a good
guy. His flaws are laid bare and he shows himself to be much more
detached than emotional.<br /><br />Swedish - This is the &#x22;good guy&#x22; side of Mikael. He is sensitive,
caring, and smart. He shows a protective side when it comes to Lisbeth.
Physically speaking the Swedish Blomkvist doesn&#x27;t look as sturdy as his
American counterpart. He has a gut and appears to be quite a bit older
than Lisbeth which can make the relationship between them more shudder
inducing and probably accounts for why there are fewer sex scenes
between them in the Swedish version. <br /><br />-LISBETH SALANDER-<br /><br />American - Perhaps because Blomkvist was made into such a strong
character Lisbeth was then morphed into a more withdrawn and vulnerable
girl so as to complement the new Blomkvist. She still has attitude,
aggression, and rage but she also exhibits a quiet shy side that was
not in the original as well as more of a romantic side.<br /><br />Swedish - In this version Lisbeth is not shy, not gentle, and not nice.
She doesn&#x27;t chase Blomkvist - he chases her. She perfectly embodies
everything you think of when you think of a strong female lead and has
an unpredictability and edge to her that is exciting to watch.<br /><br />-OVERALL- <br /><br />I liked the American Mikael and the Swedish Lisbeth. <br /><br />While I may prefer a scene or two from the Swedish version, such as the
ending, overall I enjoyed the American version more. Primarily that was
due to the more polished feel and the way in which the film was shot as
the 2011 version never felt slow. On the flip side, I can understand
why some may hate this version because Lisbeth was their favorite
character and she&#x27;s been changed into something they don&#x27;t like. For
me, the modifications to Lisbeth&#x27;s character weren&#x27;t severe enough to
put me off.<br /><br />The Swedish version captured a cult following for a reason and I would
recommend both to anyone who has an interest in darker gritty movies
that have a raw intensity to them. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
isn&#x27;t for the faint of heart and that&#x27;s what I love about it!
