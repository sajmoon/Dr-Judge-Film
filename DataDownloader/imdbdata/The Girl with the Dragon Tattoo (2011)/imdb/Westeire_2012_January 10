I thought the Swedish Movie was outstanding. Wanted to see what
Hollywood could do to make it better. Well I was surprised. I still
think Noomi Rapace who plays Lisbeth in the Swedish version did a great
job. However the US version is a great work, very close to the book,
well directed well edited. Mara Rooney transformed Lisbeth into the
Lisbeth of the book. So if you have read the book and seen the Swedish
version and you like both of them then you will like the movie. I can
see this being a classic and I can&#x27;t wait to see the next 2 movies.
Craig does his part very well.. But the star of the movie and the
leading person really has to be Mara.
