David Fincher...Best Director, Rooney Mara...Best Actress, Daniel
Craig...Best Actor. Oh yes, and whoever the editor was......Best
Editing! From the opening credits, which grabbed me into the mystery to
the incredible editing (the movie could have been 4 hours long were it
not for the editing) and the incredible story (thank you Mr.
Larsson)this is one hell of a movie. I don&#x27;t think I have had such an
experience as this movie gave me....EVER! (and that&#x27;s saying a lot,
because I have been a movie buff all my life, an actor, writer and
director) and a play reviewer for the past 5 years. This movie is
probably not for everyone, but I suspect, a few million people will. Oh
yes, Rooney Mara, I was blown away by her performance!
