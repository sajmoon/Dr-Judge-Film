I had heard many things before going to see this movie. I am a film
critic as a hobby, and I knew that the critics all loved this movie,
however, many people I know who went to see it absolutely hated it. If
you go to the movies to socialize and eat popcorn, then this movie is
probably not for you. However, if you look for near perfection in a
deep, dark, yet tormentingly beautiful movie, then you will love &#x22;The
Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.&#x22; <br /><br />I always appreciate when movies are deep, and even when there is a main
story, there are messages throughout about different subjects. Although
this film is essentially about a murder mystery, it is SO much more
than that. As you progress through the story with these characters that
you become hopelessly attached to, there are many symbolic scenarios
that say a lot about human emotion, relationships, and victims of
violence.<br /><br />I know that this is a short review, but it is mostly because I could go
on for weeks about how masterful this movie is. With excellent acting,
a gripping story, interesting characters, and symbolism, &#x22;The Girl With
The Dragon Tattoo&#x22; is not for the weak minded, and certainly not for
people who can&#x27;t see past what is on the screen. This film has made its
way on my top 5 movies of all time - It sucks you in and doesn&#x27;t let
up, and even being over 2 hours and 30 minutes, it will leave you
craving more.
