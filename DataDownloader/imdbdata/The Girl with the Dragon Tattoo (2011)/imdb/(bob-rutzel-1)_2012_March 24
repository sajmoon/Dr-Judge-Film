Part owner of Millennium magazine, Mikael Blomquist (Daniel Craig) is
convicted of libel, but has some time before sentencing and is hired by
Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to find out what happened to
Harriet, his niece, who disappeared 40-years ago and is believed
deceased. Mikael hires Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) to help with his
investigation. <br /><br />I believe most movie goers have seen the Swedish version of this movie
and are busy comparing notes of what was similar, different and so on.
So let&#x27;s get to it.<br /><br />For my part, I have also seen the Swedish version and it was excellent
having watched via sub titles, but I must go on record as saying the US
version is just as good but perhaps, more clear regarding the story
line. The Swedish version had too many sub plots that had one
memorizing them to see what impact they would have on the main story.
None is the answer. <br /><br />Differences......there are some. The setting is Sweden, but the
currency is not touted in Swedish Kronas, but USD; no accents were
heard and they were clever enough not to show us traffic direction
signs that were in Swedish. In the Swedish version I do not recall
Henrik Vanger purchasing controlling interest in Millennium magazine.
Where Harriet is discovered is completely different in this version.
Does it matter? No. There were no lingering shots of the landscapes as
were in the Swedish version. Pity, I missed them. <br /><br />One big difference is that in this version Mikael tracks down Lisbeth
to help in his investigation whereas in the Swedish version it is
Lisbeth who hacks into Mikael&#x27;s computer to give him clues re the
disappearance of Harriet as she knows what he was hired for by Henrik.
Then Mikael feels she can help him. Does this make any difference to
the story? No.<br /><br />Now for the question I just know you have: Who was the better Mikael?
Michael Nyqvist or Daniel Craig? They were both excellent and no one
outdid the other. <br /><br />But, let&#x27;s get to the real question: Who was the better Lisbeth
Salander? Noomi Rapace or Rooney Mara? Both were excellent, and could
have been interchangeable, but&#x85;&#x85;..this story made the Rooney Lisbeth
softer, more giving. But, we cared more for the Noomi Lisbeth because
we wanted her to be softer, more giving and she wasn&#x27;t. But we still
cared more for her. See? Also, the Swedish version had more story face
time with Noomi than with Rooney. <br /><br />Both versions had the sex scenes between Mikael and Lisbeth but the US
version showed them 2-times whereas the Swedish version only once. In
this version, Lisbeth orally servicing her Guardian was shown more
graphically and the rape scene seemed to go on longer here than in the
Swedish version. More total frontal nudity was shown in this version. <br /><br />Both versions are very good and quite engaging and the differences do
not hinder the story, but in the US version things become clearer
without the non-important sub plots that were in the Swedish version.
If you didn&#x27;t see the Swedish version, this version will do. But, if
you want to compare notes&#x85;&#x85;&#x85;..<br /><br />Now for the question that still remains: Is there another country that
will do a remake of this story? England? India? (hey, India makes more
movies than the US. Why should they be left out? Huh?) And, yes there
are two more stories to this trilogy. Any takers on the horizon?
