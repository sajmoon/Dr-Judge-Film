After reading all 3 books by Larson, I saw the movie yesterday and am
Pleased that the plot followed the book in almost all instances given
that there&#x27;s only so much time to follow the book in its entirety. I
thought it was well done, even though I would have been pleased WITHOUT
the intimate sexual scenes with Blomqvist. Photography was well done
and detail was attended throughout the movie. I would like to have seen
more dialog regarding Elizabeth&#x27;s computer skills as that was played up
well in the book. All in all I really did enjoy the presentation and am
looking forward to, hopefully, the next installment.<br /><br />I rate it 9+
