The book was engrossing. The film sticks reasonably close to the
original. So - good book, good film. BUT.... <br /><br />The soundtrack is really, really, really annoying!<br /><br />A movie is a careful combination of cinematography, editing, script,
acting, sets and location, costumes, score, etc. Invariably when one of
these sets out to &#x22;upstage&#x22; the rest, the entire production suffers.
Too often in this film the background noise - sometime music, more
often sound effects - overwhelms all other elements. Almost like a
small child screaming &#x22;LOOK AT ME! LOOK AT ME!&#x22; I found myself wanting
to shout at the screen &#x22;OK. I got it. Now go away.&#x22;
