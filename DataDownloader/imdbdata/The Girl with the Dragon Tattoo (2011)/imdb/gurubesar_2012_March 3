Trust the Hollywood to bring in the big guns, Daniel Craig, Christopher
Plummer to hopefully make a better movie. I admit the whole story run
quite smoothly, not to say that the original Swedish version is bad. I
would say they are comparable. If you read the novel and saw the
Swedish version, you get the chance to see and make comparison.<br /><br />Some of the minor details are really annoying. One example; I do not
think that a Swedish girl in has a diary entry written in English,
specially when you considered that the writer of the diary is a 14 or
16 years old girls. I know they have a good education in Sweden,
but.... come on, it is more logical to have a teenage girl writing her
diary in her own mother tongue.<br /><br />Of course I suspect there is a bit of commercialism on the movie. Apple
computer for one thing is shown so many times in the movie. Coincident
? I don&#x27;t believe so, but this minor details in my opinion ruins the
movie. I don&#x27;t remember seeing something similar in the original movie,
but you know Hollywood.... why not sell some advertising space if you
can....<br /><br />Anyway, if you have some free minutes to waste, this is not a bad movie
to watch.
