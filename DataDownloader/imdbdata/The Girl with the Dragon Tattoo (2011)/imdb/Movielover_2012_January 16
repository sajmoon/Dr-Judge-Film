I was ready to walk out of this movie but after a certain point I had
to see the perpetrators pay for their behavior so I had some closure.
With 6 million pedophiles in the U.S., whoever made this movie is
obviously one of them. If you are a sick, insensitive, monster then you
might like this movie. Nothing but &#x22;non-gratuitous&#x22; sex and violence,
with graphic, traumatizing scenes for any normal human being.<br /><br />It is not until you are halfway through the movie before you find out
the main female character&#x27;s age. Save yourself some stress and research
this movie before going. The trailers do not warn you.<br /><br />I heard others saying the same thing when I was walking out of this
movie so I am not alone in this.<br /><br />Please be warned! If you have ever been raped, tortured, or molested in
any way then you should avoid this movie.
