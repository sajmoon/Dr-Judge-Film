Why the venerable David Fincher would attempt a Hollywood remake of the
first-rate Swedish thriller &#x27;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#x27; may seem
perplexing at first, but just wait till you see what Fincher has
brought to his adaptation of the popular Stieg Larsson pulp novel.
Indeed, though Niels Arden Oplev&#x27;s film may have been the first out of
the gate, it is Fincher&#x27;s that proves to be the superior one, for the
auteur&#x27;s return to twisted serial-killer territory is an even more
heart- stopping, gripping and altogether exhilarating edge-of-your-seat
movie than its predecessor.<br /><br />As his work with &#x27;Se7en&#x27; and &#x27;Zodiac&#x27; will attest, Fincher is no
stranger to dark, disturbing material. &#x27;Tattoo&#x27; is no different; here
is a bleak and brutal story of crime and punishment that features
scenes of sadistic rape, twisted torture, and grotesque
religiously-inclined murders. It is a tale of uncompromising savagery,
and Fincher seems right at home, combining the lurid elements inherent
within Larsson&#x27;s tale with the sharp procedural rigour of his earlier
&#x27;Zodiac&#x27;.<br /><br />Following an edgy and utterly mesmerising title sequence set to Trent
Reznor&#x27;s rip of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &#x27;The Immigrant Song&#x27;, the remake opens
with Stockholm-based magazine journalist Mikael Bolmkvist (Daniel
Craig) losing a high-profile libel suit filed by corrupt businessman
Hans-Erik Wennerstrom (Ulf Friberg). Facing bankruptcy and the
reputational ruin of the magazine Millennium he co-publishes with his
married on-again/ off-again lover Erika Berger (Robin Wright), Mikael
accepts an unusual offer from industrial magnate Henrik Vanger
(Christopher Plummer) to investigate the unsolved murder of his beloved
niece Harriet 40 years ago.<br /><br />Henrik is convinced that Harriet&#x27;s disappearance was an act of murder
by a member of his sprawling family, which he describes as a collection
of &#x22;thieves, misers, bullies, and basically the most detestable
collection of people that you will ever meet&#x22;. Enticed by Vanger&#x27;s
reward of a hefty paycheck and payback against Wennerstrom down the
road, Mikael moves into a cottage on Henrik&#x27;s vast estate and meets
with his various family members under the guise of being tasked with
writing their family biography. <br /><br />Whereas the Swedish original wasted little time bringing together
Mikael and the computer punk-goth genius Lisbeth Salander (Rooney
Mara), Hollywood veteran screenwriter Steven Zaillian keeps them apart
for pretty much the first half of the movie. The parallel narratives
allow us to delve deeper into the Millennnium trilogy&#x27;s most compelling
character, whose startling physical appearance is simply an extension
of her troubled inner persona. That personality is amply expressed
through two of the film&#x27;s most unsettling scenes- the first, a brutal
rape by her legally assigned guardian Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen);
and the second, her coolly calculated act of revenge against Bjurman.
If those scenes left you squirming the first time round, you may want
to cover your eyes here, for Fincher stages them unflinchingly for
maximum shock value.<br /><br />Perhaps even more than Oplev managed to, Fincher evokes empathy from
his audience for Lisbeth. It is no easy task- how does one identify
with a teenage girl who lives on Happy Meals and caffeine and wears a
T-shirt that reads &#x22;F**k You, You F**king F**k&#x22;? But beyond her
tough-girl hard- as-nails exterior, Fincher guides Mara to tone down
her character&#x27;s feral nature and draw out Lisbeth&#x27;s vulnerabilities.
There is a fragility to Mara&#x27;s spellbinding portrayal of Lisbeth that
is missing from Noomi Rapace&#x27;s in the original, so even though Mara
doesn&#x27;t succeed in topping Rapace&#x27;s star-making turn, she too
disappears just as convincingly into the role. <br /><br />Mara also shares great rapport with her co-star Craig, and though both
hold their own on their own, the film truly sizzles after the latter&#x27;s
Mikael tracks her down to be his research assistant. Despite the
sombreness of the material, Zaillian injects some brief moments of
levity through Mikael and Lisbeth&#x27;s wry chemistry, bouncing theories
off each other like offbeat detectives while sifting through Biblical
clues and old photographs. Fincher has been infamous for being
extremely meticulous in his filmmaking, and that discipline pays off
with a crystal clarity he brings to the investigative procedural. More
so than the original, there is both paceyness and coherence to the
storytelling- with due credit to Zaillian for adroitly paring the
excesses of the novel into a lean and efficient cinematic adaptation. <br /><br />Despite the almost two-and-a-half-hour duration, you&#x27;ll find yourself
hooked the entire time, unable to pull yourself away from the
arrestingly intense atmosphere permeating the whole movie. Assembling
once again his &#x27;Social Network&#x27; team- made up of composers Trent Reznor
and Atticus Ross, cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth, as well as editors
Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall- Fincher uses their considerable talents to
construct a sense of forebodingness with a haunting score and evocative
cinematography of the frosty Scandinavian landscape.<br /><br />If there is one quibble, it is that the actors&#x27; accents (English with a
Swedish inflection) don&#x27;t always ring true- especially Craig, who
thankfully drops his sometimes indecipherable Swedish intonation early
on in the film in favour for a straight-out British one. And yes, it is
but a minor flaw in an otherwise pitch-perfect thriller, where
everything- from atmosphere to storytelling to casting to
characterisation- is done to a T and coheres so flawlessly to create a
taut, riveting and adrenaline-pumping movie experience. It&#x27;s not often
we say this- but even if you&#x27;ve read the books, and seen the Swedish
original, this superior first-rate Hollywood adaptation is a must-see.<br /><br />- www.moviexclusive.com
