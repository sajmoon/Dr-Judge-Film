There was such a high expectation of this film after being so
enthralled with the book. I found that the book had so vividly conjured
up strong images of both characters and locale that it might be
disappointing in how it was portrayed in film. So it was very
refreshing to see such a great book so well translated to the screen.
The casting was superb, each character very much true to the portrayal
represented in the book. Even though the book had a high shock impact
with the violence and sex, it was very sensitively and well presented.
In addition, the filming of Stockholm city centre and the Swedish
countryside was beautifully captured. Although a longer-than-average
film, I never found myself losing interest. What was cut and edited
from the book was expertly handled, without losing anything of
importance. Even the few changes to the book were handled well. I now
look forward to the next book being filmed!
