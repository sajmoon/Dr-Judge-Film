2011_December 19 
Your appreciation and enjoyment for this film mainly comes down to
whether you buy into the story or not and whether you are you a fan of
the original book (I should probably say books, since this is the first
part of a trilogy). Unfortunately my answer to both questions is quite
a drastic no: I know I am going to be quite unpopular with this
statement, but I&#x27;ve never really fallen in love with the book and I in
fact just don&#x27;t seem to be able to find the appeal for the actual story
itself. I find it quite derivative, exploitive, contrived and a bit
heavy-handed to be honest. These exact same problems are translated (in
fact even enhanced) into both film adaptations. It&#x27;s probably unfair to
draw comparisons with Niels Arden Oplev&#x27;s 2009 version, but also
unavoidable. There are of course similarities, but given the fact that
David Fincher is directing, the US version is a lot more slicker and
cinematic. It is also closer to the original book in many places, but,
as always in condensing it all into a movie, it has lost some of its
more polemical thrusts from Larsson&#x27;s story and some of the details
which made the characters so compelling. All for the sake of the actual
crime/mystery plot (which let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s pretty bland for today&#x27;s
standards and brings very little new to the genre). So in the end, not
only the film suffers from the same problems of the book but by
shrinking it all it has lost some of its more subtle subtext too. I am
not really saying anything new here: what works in books doesn&#x27;t
necessarily work movies. For example, the film spends a long time
setting up the two main characters who don&#x27;t meet until a good hour and
20 minutes into the story. And yet despite all this time Daniel Craig&#x27;s
character is just as elusive to the audience as it was at the
beginning. That is an ongoing problem with Fincher&#x27;s movies. His usual
cold approach to film-making and detachment from his characters makes
it always very hard for anyone to empathise with anyone on the screen.
Craig does bring some unexpected charm and a slight sense of humour to
his character (something which was completely absent in the previous
version), but it&#x27;s really not enough to make you care for his
character, let alone for making you want to watch him again for the
next couple of sequels (Fincher has recently announced his interest to
direct both sequels back to back&#x85; But no official announcement will be
made until this one get released, of course). It&#x27;s Rooney Mara who
really steals the show here (well, let face it, so did Noomi Rapace in
the previous version. It&#x27;s a great part to play!). This is one of the
performances of the year and there will certainly be nominations and
awards for her coming left and right over the next few months. She even
manages bring a certain realism to an otherwise over-the-top character
by convey both fragility and an incredible strength, sometimes with
pure simple looks. However, did we really need that 1 hour and 20
minutes of preparation before these two characters meet? Did we really
need to see the infamous rape scene? Yes of course, it&#x27;s that rape that
gives her the motivation for wanting to solve the crime, but why
couldn&#x27;t they just convey that with a quick flashback? Why was the
audience allowed inside that room watching not only the rape but also
her revenge to her rapist? Wouldn&#x27;t it have been just as effective and
less exploitive if we had been left outside the door, maybe listening
to the screams? The problem is, if you take all that preamble out of
the equation, you&#x27;re actually left with very little else because let&#x27;s
face it, as a mystery this is a fairly derivative film. As I said,
these are all queries with the book and the story itself . Given the
material Fincher has probably down the best he could. This is a
handsome film, with some solid acting (Plummer once again is at his
best!) but in the end you&#x27;re left with a sense of &#x22;&#x85;so what?&#x22;. I
couldn&#x27;t help feeling that everything that Fincher did in this film, he
had already done it before. The dark tones of Se7en, the seedy and
multi-layered atmosphere of Zodiac, the dark ominous music (if we can
call it that) by Trent Reznor from The Social Network. Finally it&#x27;s
probably worth mentioning the impressive &#x22;James Bondesque&#x22; title
sequence (again, Fincher has down beautiful title sequences before) to
the notes of the cover version of &#x22;Immigrant Song&#x22; by Led Zeppelin
which I found absolutely mesmerising and yet somehow seemed to belong
to a different film altogether. In the end this film adds very little
to the previous version, aside from giving us the wonderful Rooney
Mara, and certainly adds nothing to what I already know about David
Fincher. I just look forward to seeing him handling a script and a
story worth of his craft, because I do believe he&#x27;s one of the best
directors out there right now&#x85; Moviegeekblog.com
