Having seen the 2009 Swedish version of this film I thought it might be
interesting to see how Hollywood treated it. I have to say I was
pleasantly surprised. The location and key elements of the story were
kept the same, but obviously a bigger budget allowed for a more
cinematic experience. I will give you my thoughts after this brief
summary.<br /><br />When journalist and Editor Mikael Blomkvist is sued by a businessman he
had written a story about, he finds himself with no savings and a
reputation in tatters. Fortunately, an industrialist, Henrik Vanger,
wants him to investigate the disappearance of his niece, Harriet, over
forty years ago. Before engaging him, Vanger had Blomkvist investigated
by a security firm who had used the pierced, tattooed, punk computer
hacker Lisbeth Salander as the investigator. We follow Blomkvist&#x27;s
investigation along with events in Lisbeth&#x27;s life (which are sometimes
quite hard to watch). Eventually Blomkvist reaches a point where he
needs an assistant and Lisbeth is recommended to him. This is where
things start to get really interesting&#x85; and also the point I will stop
my little summary. I don&#x27;t want the Spoiler Police on my doorstep as
3AM (again).<br /><br />Beautifully shot and very well produced; David Fincher has a well
deserved reputation as a filmmaker and it shows. Great performances all
round; Daniel Craig did a great job as Mikael Blomkvist, as did Rooney
Mara as Lisbeth Salander, she had a very tough act to follow in Noomi
Rapace but I thought she acquitted herself well. Also worth of note
were; Christopher Plummer as Henrik Vanger, Stellan Skarsg&#xE5;rd as Martin
Vanger, Steven Berkoff as Frode, Robin Wright as Erika Berger and
Yorick van Wageningen as Bjurman.<br /><br />Having seen the original I cannot but fail to make comparisons and I
must say this version is just as good. I say that because I found this
one a lot easier to follow, the storyline has been streamlined
somewhat. Also, the production is far more elaborate; it obviously had
a much bigger budget. As far as performances go though I think the
original has the edge; to me Noomi Rapace played the part of Lisbeth
Salander so well that anyone else playing that part was going to
struggle to top it. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Rooney Mara did a fine job and
if I hadn&#x27;t seen Noomi Rapace in the role I may well have been singing
her praises. I have given this version the same score as the original
and I&#x27;m very happy to give it my seal of approval: Recommended.<br /><br />My score: 8.2/10.<br /><br />IMDb Score: 8.2/10 (based on 20,621 votes when this review was
