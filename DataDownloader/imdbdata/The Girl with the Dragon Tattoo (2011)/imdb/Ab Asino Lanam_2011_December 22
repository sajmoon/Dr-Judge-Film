I don&#x27;t understand why Hollywood wants to remake a perfectly good film
(http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1132620/). I don&#x27;t think anyone in
Hollywood is arrogant enough to think they can make a better version of
this film. It&#x27;s stupid to have this remake be set in Sweden but have
everyone speak English. It seems like a movie made for gullible
Americans (I am ashamed at what my compatriots deem to be quality
entertainment).<br /><br />Once again Hollywood dumbs things down, makes everything transparent
and easily digestible for 10 year-olds and expect a lot of people to
flock to the theaters to watch this junk.<br /><br />Just another cash cow for the Hollywood bankers.<br /><br />This film has got STUPID written all over it.
