Some would say that there are some quite dramatic scenes portraying
anal rape and oral sex, but its the role thats important as is the
provocative state of the female hacker with a dragon tattoo. Whats with
the girl hackers that&#x27;s so appealing to see in the movies? They aren&#x27;t
the weaker sex in any way, neither are here as an informant of the
digital age. Long story short, Craig is sent to investigate a long ago
missing of a young woman belonging to a rich Sweden family. He gets
help from an eccentric girl with a tattoo of a black dragon on her
back. She is a master hacker, estranged and weird in terms of regular
world. She doesn&#x27;t fit in, but she is so skillful in computers and
investigations. Sweden family keeps this dark secret hidden by all
means, except one member thats keen to find out the truth. I would like
to point out this masterful and very realistic acting of Rooney Mara,
that has thrown aside the whole effect of ancient &#x22;Hackers&#x22;, has earned
her a well deserved Oscar. Angelina Jolie, step aside, the new faces
are coming and they outshine you!
