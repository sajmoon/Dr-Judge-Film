For the most part, David Fincher&#x27;s new adaptation of The Girl with the
Dragon Tattoo is identical to the original film. A few minor
substitutions work their way into the script, most notably with
dialogue, physical characteristics, jobs, and bits of backstory that
are added or excised; but the essential plot is still present. The use
of spoken English is particularly helpful for American audiences
(despite fouling up the logical side of printed materials, character
nationality, and Epson/Mac product placement), and the use of familiar
character actors aids sorting out the extensive assemblage of suspects.
The sense of originality, uniqueness and suspense has diminished,
however, largely because of the sheer reach and popularity of the first
theatrical adaptation.<br /><br />Millennium Magazine journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is sued
for libel when he prints a scathing article about billionaire
industrialist hotshot Hans-Erik Wennerstrom. Even though Mikael&#x27;s
credibility is shot, the retired head of the Vanger Corporation
approaches the investigator to research the murder of his 16-year-old
great-niece, some 40 years earlier. Vanger is convinced it was someone
in the family, most of who still live unsociably on an unfriendly
island in Sweden. &#x22;I&#x27;m quickly losing track of who&#x27;s who,&#x22; Blomkvist
comments, as the family is large and reclusive; providing information
to a stranger is also not high on their priority list. Meanwhile,
Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a surveillance agent and researcher who
provided investigative materials on Blomkvist to Vanger, is recruited
by Mikael to aid him in his search for the culprit - believed to be a
serial killer targeting Jewish women and performing ritualistic
mutilations.<br /><br />While the actors all perform admirably, especially those with more
challenging, revealing roles (the striking character development and
raw power of their actions being a particular highlight of the series
of books), the unavoidable element that follows this take is the
severity and extremeness of the sexual violence. It&#x27;s no less potent,
even for viewers familiar with what happens, but more likely to incite
disputation for no other reason than its basis as an American film
(foreign films garner a certain leniency when depicting questionable
sexual material). The studio is even trying to push the envelope with
the poster art. While the novel is purposeful in its rendering and
authenticity towards rape, coupled with abuse of power (more evident in
the original title &#x22;Men Who Hate Women&#x22;), these moments are
overwhelming on camera &#x96; to the point that the controversial scenes
will likely take attention away from the murder mystery at hand. And
the dark, cryptic, intense unraveling of clues is where the real
thrills await. The white-knuckle climax is shocking, draining and
unexpected, wrapping up a thriller worthy of the cinematographic focus.<br /><br />Perhaps most puzzling of all is the opening credits, which demonstrates
a bizarre mixture of H.R. Giger&#x27;s art, Spider-man&#x27;s Venom, computer
components, thick black oil and the human body, resembling a James Bond
music video title sequence (James Bondage?). It doesn&#x27;t fit the rest of
the movie, and instead of setting up a more Gothic, disturbing, modern
twist on author Stieg Larsson&#x27;s epic, it builds a greater rift in the
deceptive normalcy of the initial settings. Trent Reznor&#x27;s accompanying
score, with pulsing, artificial sounds and electronic beats, is much
less sincere than the standard orchestral work more suited to crime
pictures. Although the character development, with two extremely
contrasting individuals and unrelated situations, is astounding
(chiefly with the strong female protagonist of Salander), the separate
nature of their stories feels even more distant. But that is
insignificant compared to the intrusive expansion of the film&#x27;s
denouement, which is noticeably longwinded, stuffed with details, and
drags out the satisfaction of the big reveal and resolution for the
killer. Whether or not this is more faithful to the novel, 2009&#x27;s
foreign-language version was smarter to keep the immediacy and energy
of the solution fresh by abridging the falling action.<br /><br />- The Massie Twins (GoneWithTheTwins.com)
