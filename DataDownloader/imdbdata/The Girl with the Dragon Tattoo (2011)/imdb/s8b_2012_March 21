I waited anxiously for the opportunity to see this movie because I
really liked the original, which I have seen three or four times
without getting bored. I was disappointed because this version is
vastly inferior to the Swedish version.<br /><br />Summary of just a few of the failures: Bjurman in the original was a
portrayal of psychotic evil. Bjurman in the remake indicates that he is
remorseful and that his bad behavior was an aberration. Boring.<br /><br />The revenge scene against Bjurman in the original was powerful and
riveting. The new scene is lacking the tension. It is more emoting than
acting. Boring.<br /><br />Lisbeth by Noomi was edgy, isolated, autistic, and thoroughly
interesting. It was one of the best film performances I have ever seen.
Lisbeth by Rooney is more like a Valley Girl gone Goth. She&#x27;s way too
close to being a normal, functioning person. Boring.<br /><br />Daniel Craig could have phoned in the performance (except maybe the sex
scenes, which were inferior to the original).<br /><br />Martin&#x27;s demise in the accident was much more interesting in the
original, where Lisbeth refuses to save him from the fire. In the
remake, Lisbeth approaches the car with the intent, we believe, to
shoot Martin, but the car disappears in a (boring) Hollywood fireball.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t think there was any reference to Lisbeth&#x27;s problems with her
father, which is the key to her behavior, in the new version.<br /><br />The pacing and editing intruded with, rather than propelled, the story
in the new version. Distracting and....boring.<br /><br />The artsy opening credits didn&#x27;t add a thing to improve the experience
of watching this bomb.<br /><br />Which begs the question I always ask in these circumstances: What is
the point of remaking an excellent movie?<br /><br />Or maybe it&#x27;s just me.
