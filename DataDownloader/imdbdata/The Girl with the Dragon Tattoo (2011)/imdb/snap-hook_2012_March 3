2012_March 3 
I will confess that I have not read the book. I tried to listen to it
on a cross country trip with my daughter of 25, but some scenes were a
bit sexually graphic and we jointly agreed to bag it. That said, I have
seen both the Swedish version and American remake. Give me the voice
over Swedish version, please.<br /><br />Is it just me or do others look at Daniel Craig and see him sitting
naked on a bottomless chair asking a man with a rope and ball to
scratch an itch down there. I&#x27;m sorry, but this was one of the worst
casting jobs of a starring role I have ever seen. Craig is simply not
believable in the role of a magazine publisher. Next is Lisbeth
Salander played by Rooney Mara. Though Mara does a fine job as Lisbeth,
there is so little depth to the character that I didn&#x27;t care about her
or what happened to her at all; OK I didn&#x27;t care about Blomkvist
either. The Swedish version provides clips of her past to partially
explain why she is as she is. I came to care for what happened to that
Lisbeth. Mikael&#x27;s character is also much more defined in the Swedish
version.<br /><br />The two plots follow along pretty much the same path, but this version
seems to be so utterly devoid of character development it feels like
Martin&#x27;s kitchen, sanitary and devoid of any decoration. Even
Christopher Plummer falls short, and he never does that. Without the
character development I felt like I was watching a movie instead of
experiencing it. There is no emotional attachment as there is in the
original.<br /><br />I rated it a six only by refusing a comparison with the original. In
comparison, I&#x27;d give it a 1. Watch the original and avoid this
substandard remake.
