Review The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.<br /><br />The English adaptation of the runaway success story of &#x27;The girl with
the Dragon Tattoo&#x27; was always going to be a large undertaking due to
the &#x27;best-selling&#x27; Stieg Larsson&#x27;s Novel and the highly rated Swedish
adaptation by M&#xE4;n som hatar kvinnor.<br /><br />Even for a director such as David Fincher, who can boast a career built
on many hugely popular titles such as &#x27;Se7en&#x27;, &#x27;Fight club&#x27; and &#x27;The
Social Network&#x27;, an undertaking of this magnitude and an inability to
produce a film that was deemed worthy of its attachment to the novel
would be disastrous. Although not doubting his ability, the undertaking
of this project could be seen as a bold but exciting move. Fincher&#x27;s
adaptation is every bit exhilarating and in depth as the base material.<br /><br />The intense intricacies of the novel are displayed well throughout the
film. These are an essential foundation for the trilogy but are
obviously detrimental the motion and speed of the picture. For a 2:40
hour film, these areas can slow the pace to a point where people around
me were nearly nodding off. Combined with an inability of many English
speakers to learn and follow the characters Swedish names, the opening
of film can be challenging for those seeking easy gratification and not
familiar with the characters.<br /><br />The numerous side-by-side narratives that permeate into the main plot
are very well constructed, shot and acted. It is through these vessels
that Daniel Craig and in particular, Rooney Mata shine.<br /><br />Mara&#x27;s transformation into the &#x27;cyberpunk-esque&#x27; hacker is flawless. I
often completely forgot her as an actress, a true testament to her
performance. I found that she breathed a greater sense of humanity into
her version of the character which was a great loyalty to the novel.<br /><br />Craig&#x27;s performance is obviously integral to the film but it is all the
better alongside the mesmerising Stellan Skarsg&#xE5;rd as Martin. His
performance is truly great and sits well alongside the strong acting
casts&#x27; offerings.<br /><br />The film displays the action and points of conflict in a heart racing
trance, you cannot help but be consumed by the intensity and realism
that&#x27;s pouring out the screen. Brutal, unflinching but not prosaic in
the slightest, these scenes bind the audience to the characters trails
and battles in a very close and personal way. We feel their pain, think
their thoughts and sympathise with their positions.<br /><br />Throughout the viewing experience you are held by that feeling that the
film you are watching is going to be something that not only will you
watch again, but champion it to your friends and colleagues. I have
already had discussions about this film with groups of people that some
may regard as outside of the typical demographic. Like the novel and
Swedish version this has the ability and power to mesmerise large
portions of the population. An excellent adaptation expertly
constructed and flawlessly acted.<br /><br />8/10 The_Frase
