First off I&#x27;d like to say that I neither read the original best-selling
books nor saw the original movie trilogy - my criticism of the story is
therefore more a critique of the screenplay and the idea of making such
a story into a movie in the first place.<br /><br />That being said: &#x22;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#x22; is definitely a good
movie, it&#x27;s certainly a lot better than most features that came out in
the last year. If the plot description interests you, go see it, and
you will be entertained.<br /><br />Fincher&#x27;s direction is pretty much flawless. He knows exactly what to
show when in what length and angle, and gives the film a stylistic look
without distracting the audience from the story by over-saturating it
visually. I was surprised to find out that the movie actually uses a
lot of CGI ( you won&#x27;t be able to spot it ). Check out pre-production
shots if you can find them online - I like that Fincher reserves CGI as
a tool for things you simply cannot do or find in real life. Looking at
the difference between pre- and post-production shots, it becomes
evident that he is a ridiculously talented director who has a detailed
picture of the scene he wants to film in his head, and then only uses
CGI to match reality to that brain-image if necessary.<br /><br />Judging from what he was dealing with, he probably brought the
story/screenplay out as good as you possibly can.<br /><br />That&#x27;s my main criticism though - the story: While I actually did like
it ( not that it&#x27;s too original ), I feel that it simply isn&#x27;t the kind
of story that works best in feature films.<br /><br />Telling the story of people investigating a family tragedy, in which
about a dozen similar-looking family members are involved, requires the
possibility to introduce us to at least said dozen minor characters in
the first place - but we&#x27;re talking about a single movie here, which
also extensively focuses on our two protagonists.<br /><br />This means, of course, that most of these characters, which would be
multi-layered and spark interest in books, become cardboard-cutouts
that are glimpsed through windows once or twice and never to be seen
again. The format of a single feature film reduces the number of
relevant characters drastically, and it hurts the story, as it becomes
pretty obvious before any plot twist who can and can not be relevant to
the case.<br /><br />I guess if I could unsee this movie I would - despite its overall
quality - because I can see how this is a story that would have been
more interesting in a book.<br /><br />What also bugs me though is the character of Lisbeth Salander:<br /><br />It&#x27;s painfully obvious that she&#x27;s the authors fantasy girl - this one
idea he has of a non-existing, idealized woman, because no actual
female has ever been like that. I found it annoying how much the
audience got manipulated into liking her : Lisbeth is a very poor (
relatable ) girl with a troubled past ( vulnerable ), who has horrible
things done to her on-screen ( injustice creates sympathy, triggers
protective instinct ), despite deserving so much more ( clich&#xE9; run-down
underachieving genius, more injustice ) and being able to do pretty
much anything : She can ride a motorcycle at MotoGP-level, hack into
anything in seconds and is the number one choice for high-risk
surveillance work, despite probably never having had any training in
that field ( her story suggests that ). <br /><br />If you hate me now for writing negatively about her ( many raving
reviewers seem to have fallen in love with her ), ask yourself one
simple thing : If the character of Lisbeth was instead a man with the
EXACT same abilities and characteristics, would you care about that
character? I know i wouldn&#x27;t, because it&#x27;s not her characteristics that
make her so interesting, it&#x27;s the fact that almost everything about her
triggers your male protective instinct, and I found it annoying and
tiring to be constantly manipulated.<br /><br />Good characters spark sympathy by doing something, not by having things
done to them.<br /><br />Rooney Mara&#x27;s acting is great though, and Daniel Craig delivers his
usual solid, albeit narrow performance, rounding an
O.K.-for-the-screen, but perfectly directed story up.
