The brutal violence of &#x22;Se7en&#x22;, the complex intelligence of &#x22;Zodiac&#x22;
and the gripping style of &#x22;The Social Network&#x22; are only the tip of the
iceberg in David Fincher&#x27;s ninth feature film, &#x22;The Girl With The
Dragon Tattoo&#x22;.<br /><br />As an avid reader of the novels and original Swedish adaptations, I was
skeptical of the American &#x22;remake&#x22;, but although the original Swedish
adaptations were well-acted, especially from Noomi Rapace, they
suffered from low budgets that prevented the lavish production on
display here.<br /><br />Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross&#x27;s score is haunting, suiting the feeling
of the film perfectly, as does the ominous cinematography of the cold
Swedish countryside. Rooney Mara is outstanding as Lisbeth Salander.
She is fierce, original and, on rare occasion, insecure. Daniel Craig
is impressive as Mikael Blomkvist, while Christopher Plummer is
first-rate as Henrik Vanger. <br /><br />&#x22;The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo&#x22; is a captivating film that will have
you on the edge of your seat, whether you&#x27;ve seen the original or not.
The shocking up-front violence will surely turn some viewers off, as
will the 2&#xBD; hour running time. However, for those who do stay for the
ride, it is an entrancing journey that leads to a stunning,
heartbreaking finale.
