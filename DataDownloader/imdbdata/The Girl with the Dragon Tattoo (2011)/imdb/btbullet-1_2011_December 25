After reading all the books, and seeing all the original movies, I was
worried that this movie would be disappointing. It Is Not. Filmography
Outstanding. Location Gorgeous. The opening credits are such a wild
ride they could win an Oscar on their own. Acting was superb. Mara,
Penn, Plummer, terrific. We all know how much I love Daniel Craig, he
was made for this role, not only is he sexy and talented, he plays the
best torture victim (remember Casino Royale? Ouch!). The movie left me
looking forward to the next installment.<br /><br />Nothing more to say. But this form is telling me there are not enough
lines. I don&#x27;t care for this restriction. I don&#x27;t know why IMDb puts it
in.
