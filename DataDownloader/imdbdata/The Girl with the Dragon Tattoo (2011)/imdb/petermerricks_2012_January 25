I know it is always difficult to be faithful to the book, but I viewed
it on the basis that if I hadn&#x27;t read the plot, would I have understood
everything. Both my wife and I agreed that it was difficult to follow
on that basis.<br /><br />I do give it credit for being better than the Swedish version which was
raved about at the time, but I&#x27;m afraid that that one was even more
confusing.<br /><br />In the Swedish version it did not explore enough the relationship being
built up with Lisbeth and Mikael.<br /><br />I felt the US version was better with the casting, and I found Lisbeth
very believable in this version, and truer to the book. Daniel Craig
was a good casting too.<br /><br />I feel that I need to watch the Swedish version again to reacquaint
myself.<br /><br />I suppose that the books were simply too good.
