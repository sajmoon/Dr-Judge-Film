When it comes to mystery/ crime genres i&#x27;m more of a visual kind of
type. I&#x27;ve never read the books, so i was completely unaware and
untroubled by the fact that i&#x27;d just experiment with watching another
movie without any expectations. And i think this is one kind of way to
enjoy a film.<br /><br />For starters, the cast was fantastic! I was only remembering Daniel
Craig&#x27;s playing in this movie, never looked for any information before.
And there&#x27;s, Christopher Plummer and Stellan Skarsgard, Robin Wright
and of course Rooney Mara (she was great). Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel
Craig) is a journalist who&#x27;s been assigned to do a research on a
missing woman. Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) is a hacker who assists
him. It&#x27;s a lovely mix of mind and science. It keeps you wondering
about the crimes and the connections and the psychology. Like,
everyone&#x27;s a suspect.<br /><br />The scenery was beautiful, gloomy, overcast, creating an additional
suspense especially with the foggy locations. Cold colors. You&#x27;ll have
to get cold to get comfortable (that means your emotions, too).
Director David Fincher did a great work, and i see that he&#x27;s bringing
up &#x27;20,000 Leagues Under The Sea: Captain Nemo&#x27; in 2013. Also, &#x27;The
Girl Who Played With Fire&#x27; is the second book adaptation of the trilogy
and it will officially start shooting back in Sweden at the end of the
year.<br /><br />Overall, it&#x27;s a very interesting mystery film with nice twists. I
enjoyed it very much. All 158 minutes of it!
