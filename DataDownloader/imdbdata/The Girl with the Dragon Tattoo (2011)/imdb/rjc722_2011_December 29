A film of this magnitude always runs the risk of over-hype.
Fortunately, TGWTDT lives somewhat up to it. I can&#x27;t say that all its
158 running time is worth it, but enough of it is. Of course films
based on books always come to the screen with pre-conceived notions. In
this case there&#x27;s not only a book written by Stieg Larsson&#x85;but a
previous film to follow. This is never an easy challenge but director
David Fincher seems to have welcomed it with open arms.<br /><br />The film&#x27;s basic plot centers on the forty year old disappearance of
the niece of rich and eccentric industrialist Henrik Vanger played
handsomely by Christopher Plummer. After hiring recently humiliated
journalist and amateur sleuth Mikael Blomkvist, played by Daniel Craig,
we learn little by little about Plummer&#x27;s family tree&#x85;filled of course
with weird and rotten apples. Intercutting nicely with the detective
portion of the film is the parallel story line of the title
character&#x85;Lisbeth Salander played by an unrecognizable Rooney Mara.
After finding out Salander was initially hired to do a background check
on Blomkvist before being hired by Vanger, we follow her life which
includes computer hacking, beating up street punks and reporting to her
new court appointed guardian. This of course leads to the films most
graphic and talked about scenes which include forced sexually favors
and rape. While this is going on Blomkvist soon discovers that the
missing niece may in fact be the victim of a serial killer and requests
a research assistant. Naturally who better then the girl who researched
him and the meeting of the two main characters finally comes full
circle. Once together Blomkvist and Salander work well as a modern day
and unconventional Nick and Nora Charles to both find the serial killer
and discover the mystery of the missing niece. Along the way they also
find some sexually affection and even have time to give another
industrialist his comeuppance. Craig&#x27;s performance shows intelligence
coupled with a vulnerability that makes us forget that he&#x27;s James Bond.
Equally good is Rooney&#x27;s Salander who obviously makes us forget she&#x27;s
the beautiful girl who unwittingly launched Facebook in Fincher&#x27;s The
Social Network. Speaking of Fincher, his style here is evident
throughout with realistic violence balanced with beautifully shot
flashbacks. The ending of the film is satisfying and naturally leaves
itself open for a sequel&#x85;I just hope it will be a little shorter.
