I have watched the original one but have not read the book. I&#x27;ve also
lived in Sweden. I was apprehensive that it will be an English-i-fied,
the way that you expect when Hollywood tells stories of various
European epics, stories etc. Well this was not, Daniel did not have to
have an affected Scandinavian accent -- except for Rooney and Robin
Wright maybe. Nevertheless, the story was really told well.<br /><br />This rendition is more dramatic because Rooney evokes more
vulnerability than the original actress Noomi and maybe because it is
in English it is easy to internalize the plot. I think the opening
montage is ridiculous. Totally out of context for the movie, very James
Bond 007 like and stupid but of course does not take away from the
performance of everyone in the film. personally - I&#x27;d rather have the
original actor Michael Nyqvist than Daniel.<br /><br />It is worth seeing even though it is not as stoic as a you&#x27;d expect in
a typical Swedish movie but has the direct yet complex undertone of the
Scandinavian psyche.
