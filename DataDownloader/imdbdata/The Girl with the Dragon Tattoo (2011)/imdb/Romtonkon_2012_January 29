Niels Arden Oplev (the director of Swedish version) took the best from
Stieg Larsson&#x27;s big and mostly boring (imho) novel and made a good
thrilling movie with dumb ending which brought me a lot of questions.
Contrary to many viewers and movie critics, David Ficher just re-shot
the Swedish movie with no originality. It was made for one goal: to get
your money. Seriously, where the difference between American and
Swedish versions? Yes, remake is well made and interesting in some
parts but the same plot, lack of ingenuity and almost the same idiotic
ending make this movie an ordinary popcorn thriller which is suitable
for passing a Sunday evening in local cinema. Nothing more. Calling
this movie an Oscar snub just ridiculous, it has no material suitable
for Best Picture Nominee. Or Academy Award members should include any
entertaining blockbuster? Rooney Mara who plays Lisbeth Salander did a
very good job. This girl really tried hard to portray her character as
good as screenplay allows. But again, the writing is not original, so
Mara portray Lisbeth exactly as Noomi Rapace, maybe a little bit worse.
So, why she got a nomination for Oscar but Rapace is not?
