***1/2 out of (****)<br /><br />After waiting an impeccably long time for &#x22;Tattoo&#x22; to get the ball
rolling into cinemas, a strong critical reception was promised. And I
got that, but something was odd. Fincher&#x27;s films typically are
critically acclaimed with a solid praise, almost promising it&#x27;s THE
movie of the year (&#x22;The Social Network&#x22;, &#x22;Benjamin Button&#x22;, and
&#x22;Zodiac&#x22; anyone?). This..., this just got some solid word-of-mouth but
strangely enough, no actual hoopla. With a more than prosperous book
trilogy and Sweden film collection, how does Fincher&#x27;s glossy and more
polished, Americanized version stack up?<br /><br />&#x22;Tattoo&#x22; revolves around our central protagonist Lisbeth, played by the
iconic Rooney Mara teams up with the co-star of the show, Daniel Craig.
Together, they are on the hunt for the missing Harriet, who vanished
nearly half a century ago. <br /><br />Clocking in at an excessive 158 minutes, never once does this film drop
the ball or lose its steam. Boasting an elaborate and rather oily
opening credits sequence, what a way to kick off such a mesmerizing
movie-going experience. First off, the performances here are just
astonishing to say the least. Craig and Mara are the pitch perfect
detective duo and give it their all. I can smell some Academy
nominations. Moreover, the script of this film is extremely well
written, with various amounts of attention to detail. And how the
script is executed? Very competent, with every ounce of the script
being projected in its fullest potential. <br /><br />Now where this film shines is rather in the star power. Throughout the
film, Lisbeth and Craig&#x27;s character undergo this intimate love triangle
(if you want to even call it that) and makes things especially
interesting. But, speaking of intimate and personal, how is the much
talked about rape scene? With all the buzz revolving around the three
minute tragedy, I can definitely say I&#x27;ve seen worse, but this was
still pretty brutal to watch. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, rape is never an easy
subject to touch on, but the execution here was just disturbing and
gut- wrenching. <br /><br />What about the score? Just the cherry on top. Trent Reznor fails to
disappoint with this eerie and mostly engaging soundtrack. It
definitely enhances this film on all levels. And last but not least,
the cinematography is some of the best I&#x27;ve seen. The shots are simply
beautiful and when there isn&#x27;t your fair share of sex, rape, or
violence going on, the atmosphere is definitely one to suck you in. <br /><br />If there was a complaint I would have, it would be the pacing. The
first two hours are paced brilliantly, with Fincher directed a very
evenly paced and coherent picture. But those last 30+ minutes are
edited just very choppy and it goes off the rails a bit after a smooth
transition between the hours. <br /><br />All in all, Fincher has another winner on its hands. The acting, the
visuals, the plot, it&#x27;s all there and it&#x27;s all quite extraordinary. Is
this movie as mind-blowing and earth-shattering as the hype persuades
you to be? That&#x27;s up to you, but personally, it didn&#x27;t. But what we
have here is still a solid picture that is more than deserving to be on
a Top 10 list or two. We shall soon meet again Fincher.
