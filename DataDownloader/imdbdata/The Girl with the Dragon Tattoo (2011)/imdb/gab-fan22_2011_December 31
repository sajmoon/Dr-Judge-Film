Not since The Silence of the Lambs have I seen a movie give me as much
chills,suspense and thrill than the Girl With A Dragon Tattoo. The
story of uncovering layer after layer of a serial case is told
flawlessly by David Fincher along with excellent cinematography that
adds to the cold, bleakness of the story. But despite the bleakness,
the thing that really shone through was the performance by Rooney Mara
as Lisbeth Salander. She brings total passion, fear and strength as she
struggles with her own demons of social flaws and insanity to solve
this horrifying case of a WW2 type serial massacre of people. The other
thing i loved that we didn&#x27;t see the gore and violence that doom other
movies of this genre, but PSYCHOLOGICAL horror which is essential to
movies like this and makes them an amazing experience to watch.This
film kept me at the edge of my seat which is a very good thing
considering some of the &#x22;thriller/horror&#x22; movies made by the industry
today and i hope Rooney Mara gets an award for her extraordinary
performance.
