Utterly boring. If you thought Zodiac was slow prepare for a very
shifty/sleepy movie experience. The plot never develops or concludes it
just fizzles and the gaps in logic you can drive a truck through. The
romance between the two leads makes no sense. You can see the identity
of the killer coming since their introduction. There&#x27;s surveillance
equipment, internet and cell phones everywhere in Sweden (also everyone
in Sweden speaks English) but apparently forensic investigation doesn&#x27;t
exist nor do rape kits. Speaking of which, if we must have a
rape-revenge fantasy is a buck knife just too old fashioned nowadays?
Apparently so, because when you expect the characters to do the right
thing or at least the wrong thing for the right reasons they do the
worst thing. All you can really do is pity every character involved in
the story. There are no iconoclasts here. No matter how many tattoos
and piercings these people are the system and they exploit it to keep
the cogs turning like clockwork. But neither is this movie about
murderers. If you&#x27;ve come for grim grinning ghouls zealously plying
their trade look elsewhere, this is standard movie serial killer stuff,
the assailant has no motive and their crimes mean little more than a
plot point. Just when the audience needs catharsis and characters
pupils should turn red and the primate has to come out nothing happens.
The whole movie just lingers. &#x22;Fetish whank&#x22; would be a pretty apt
description of the whole mess. And considering the director defined the
serial killer movie both fictionally in Seven and non-fictionally in
the aforementioned Zodiac this film really is a leap backwards. Just
what exactly did another adaptation of this book accomplish save for a
paycheck?
