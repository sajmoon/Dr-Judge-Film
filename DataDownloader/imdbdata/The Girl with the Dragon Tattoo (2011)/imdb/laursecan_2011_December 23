2011_December 23 
I can&#x27;t say that there are many films where I find myself hooked before
the movie ever begins.....but, this one &#x22;got me&#x22; as soon as the lights
dimmed and the title credits began to flicker on screen. My litmus test
for judging films is based upon how long after the film I am still
thinking about it. I won&#x27;t keep you in suspense. When it comes to that
test, this film not only passed with flying colors....but totally
NAILED it! I will be thinking about &#x22;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#x22;
for quite some time and, most likely, I will see it again during my
holiday vacation. There is so much I want to pay more attention to
during the next viewing; even though there are portions in which I will
cover my eyes, as well. This is not an easy film to view. There are
some pretty graphic sexual and violent scenes. If you are considering
whether to see it now, or wait for cable - I assure you, this film is
meant to be seen on the big screen. And, this isn&#x27;t because it is in 3D
or some other campy fad...it is because it is an excellent,
suspenseful, white knuckler.<br /><br />It would be very easy to say that the one reason to see this film is
Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander (the title character) - but that would
be too simple....too obvious.....too benign. While this role is pretty
much one of the most fascinating characters I&#x27;ve seen on screen for
some time, I can honestly say that there are many, many more reasons to
view this film. &#x22;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#x22; is a thriller that
just doesn&#x27;t stop. Just when you think it&#x27;s over and the story is
done....it keeps going......as you sit in the theatre on the edge of
your seat, as if you are riding the wildest, scariest, most exciting
roller coaster you&#x27;ve ever been on. There are times during the film
that I found myself squirming in my chair, completely uncomfortable
with what was being projected, but unable to look away. I never knew
where this film was going; it surprised me....shocked me......thrilled
me.<br /><br />I borrowed the book quite a while ago, and I had resisted reading it -
as I knew the film was coming out and I purposely didn&#x27;t want to know
very much about the storyline. I could see from the coming attractions
that this movie was going to be an adventure and I wanted to ride that
adventure.....not knowing the final destination. I am pleased to say
that I do not regret that decision. (I will, by the way, read the book
now).<br /><br />I will not give away very much of the plot. The film is meant to be
experienced. Too much knowledge of the storyline.....would ruin it, in
my opinion. Daniel Craig portrays Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative
reporter and Rooney Mara portrays the mysterious Girl with the Dragon
Tattoo. During the first portion of the film, the plot follows these
characters separately....while the viewer is left to consider and
wonder what, where, and when the dots will be connected. Both story
lines are riveting....as each time the film cut from Craig&#x27;s character
to Mara&#x27;s character (or vice versa), I found my mind still focused on
the previous scene, wondering what was going to happen next.<br /><br />There are quite a few name stars in the film.....(Christopher Plummer,
Robin Wright, Joely Richardson)...but the star is the film. I loved the
camera work, the direction, the editing...the acting. &#x22;The Girl with
the Dragon Tattoo&#x22; is just really, really good film making.<br /><br />There is one particular scene, when an extremely heinous character was
figuratively hit with the Karma bus that I actually found myself giving
a loud cheer right there in the movie theatre.<br /><br />For the younger crowd, with the short attention spans - you may find
yourself having a difficult time getting into the film, as you may be
used to multiple car chases and lots of action within the first few
minutes of a film. I am going to plead with you to have a bit of
patience and allow the story to unfold. When all is not revealed in the
first 15 minutes, it is actually plain old good story telling. I know
in these days of instant messaging and pop-ups - you may not be used to
that....but do give it a chance. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!
