The original &#x22;Men som hatar kvinnor&#x22; movie was more suitable for the
plot, because the writer did write it in Swedish NOT in English. From
the beginning when the rumors of a English version of &#x22;Men som hatar
kvinnor&#x22;. I thought to myself: Is Hollywood out of idea, for a movie?
Why most they ruin a good book and a good movie? I know that I had to
see this movie, because I am such a huge fan of the original. The movie
started by giving me a feeling like I was watching a James Bond movie.
All the characters, places and things was in Swedish of course, that
made the movie fake because they spoke English throughout the whole
movie. This movie was a disappointment for me. I suggest that you buy
or rent the Swedish movie &#x22;Men som hatar kvinnor&#x22; and watch it. I hope
they don&#x27;t make the second movie at all.
