David Fincher, known for his intensely gloomy films; directs the
American adaptation of Stieg Larsson&#x27;s book.<br /><br />Having not read the book or having seen the Swedish film I wasn&#x27;t
entirely sure what was coming, but held high expectations because of
the cast and director. With established greats like Christopher Plummer
and Stellan Skarsg&#xE5;rd acting was bound to be good, however, Rooney Mara
is the one who steals the show.<br /><br />Rooney plays the role of Lisbeth Salander, an anti-social hacker with a
hate for men who abuse women. She helps Mikael Blomkvist research the
Vanger family history in hopes to reveal which family member was
responsible for the disappearance of another 40 years earlier.<br /><br />The film has a great flow to it and kept my full interest throughout.
Everything about the film was flawless. The score, cinematography,
direction, acting were all brilliant, but nothing comes close to Rooney
Mara&#x27;s breakthrough performance.<br /><br />Rooney Mara&#x27;s portrayal of Lisbeth is one that can&#x27;t be missed and one
you won&#x27;t forget. She has now proved herself as an elite actress.<br /><br />With Fincher&#x27;s magic and Mara&#x27;s acting this is easily the year&#x27;s best
film.
