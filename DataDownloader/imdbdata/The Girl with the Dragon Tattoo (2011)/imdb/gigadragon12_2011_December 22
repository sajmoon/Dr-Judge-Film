Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is essentially a whodunit layered by a
story about an investigative journalist getting his professional
dignity stripped from him and then reaffirmed. It&#x27;s central focus being
that the title character Lisbeth, is a bad ass never back down girl who
is stuck in between a rock and a hard place and performs several lewd,
violent, and otherwise &#x22;bad&#x22; acts in order to get what she wants. Where
the movie loses its center is in emphasizing the seemingly usual
whodunit plot line that is the heart of this story, but not its soul,
which lies in the personal stories of its characters.<br /><br />Before the bad stuff, let&#x27;s talk about the good stuff. The stories of
Lisbeth and the whodunit are both crafted superbly. While I can&#x27;t say
either of them are different or challenging the mainstream craft of
these types of story lines, it doesn&#x27;t change how visceral the scenes
within are. I don&#x27;t want to give anything away, but I want to say that
there are a minimum of three scenes in this movie that made my skin
crawl and my seat feel physically uncomfortable, but in a great way
that only movies can manage. Note: This movie is really not for the
weak of heart.<br /><br />Both lead actors do well with their roles. Lisbeth is brought to life
in every blank stare and movement, yet something about the whole
character seems very statue like, I can&#x27;t figure out if it&#x27;s good or
bad, but it was believable in any case. As for Daniel Craig, I&#x27;ve
enjoyed his turns as James Bond, and this role is like a less secret
agent version of that role.<br /><br />In all reality I look at this movie and I believe that what&#x27;s been done
here is very good, possibly the best film of this year, but I would
assert that that statement is not saying much. This has not been a
great year at the movies.<br /><br />However let&#x27;s address what I was alluding to about the heart of the
movie and the soul of the movie. Where the movie spends much of its
filming genius and storyline is in the whodunit plot line. Intricate
set pieces with perhaps one too many family members and flashbacks and
pictures all lend themselves to a formulaic mystery plot line that
serves as the driving point of staying with the movie. However, before
starting that plot line and for about the last thirty or so minutes of
the movie, that&#x27;s not what this movie is about.<br /><br />While the movie spends so much time working the whodunit, several other
more interesting things have happened and eventually happen that get
skated over because the biggest part of the running time was spent on
David Fincher&#x27;s version of noir, without all the pulp that comes with
the cop drama. Just about every moment of the film that doesn&#x27;t have to
do with this central theme has more interesting elements, but none of
them are spent with much time, its almost like they were put in the
movie just so people couldn&#x27;t point and say, &#x22;You left this this this
and this out of the movie when they were in the book,&#x22; but they are
thrown together so fast and recklessly that it leaves me wondering if
the book truly skated over these plot points with such abandon or if I
have to go read it to get what feels like the actual story.<br /><br />The biggest issue comes from its central characters only participating
in the whodunit because there in lies something they want. For all the
time the film spends making Lisbeth a bad ass new age woman that gets
what she wants for herself, they spend a lot of the film showing that
she really is just a dressed up girl, who makes her self out as a vamp.
None of this is more painfully shown than in the last shot of the
movie, which I&#x27;ll let all of you experience for yourselves.<br /><br />While I like this film, something about it is just unbalanced from the
story perspective. Why in a story rife with intrigue into the inner
ties of corporate leaders and secrecy and shadows and computer hacking
type activities must the plot butter up the seen a thousand times
whodunit and skip the icing with the stories centered around these
overarching elements? It doesn&#x27;t make sense, and I firmly believe this
film misses something from the book. Maybe I am wrong about that, but
it makes the film seem unbalanced in that aspect.<br /><br />And yet it is a good film. I will give it an 8 out of 10.
