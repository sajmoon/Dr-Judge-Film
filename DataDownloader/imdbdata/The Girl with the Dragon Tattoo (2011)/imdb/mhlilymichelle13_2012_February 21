I love this haunting, beautiful movie, it is one of my all time
favourites and I can&#x27;t wait until it is available on DVD. Having
watched the Swedish version first, I was very impressed and surprised
by how good this American adaptation actually is.<br /><br />Daniel Craig is excellent as the journalist Mikael Blomkvist and plays
the understated leading man role to perfection. Rooney Mara is
compelling as the dangerous and damaged computer hacker and, strangely
for an American movie, plays the role with even more perversion than
her Swedish counterpart, something I didn&#x27;t think was possible. <br /><br />The opening credit scene and score is amazing and will stay with me for
a long time.
