If I knew what I know now before I saw this movie, I probably would
have waited until it came out on video and here&#x27;s why...... I found
much of the dialog hard to understand. Many times I found myself asking
my girlfriend &#x22;what did he (or she) say?&#x22; I don&#x27;t know if it was due to
the theaters speaker system or if it was the quality of the sound
recording but much of what I heard was not much more than a mumble. It
would have helped if the actors could have spoken a little slower
and/or clearer. With that being the case, I missed a lot of some key
parts of the movie, thus losing track of what was happening. The other
thing that affected my understanding of the movie was the fact that
there were too many people/relatives to keep track of......who they
were and how they were connected to the plot. In my opinion, this is
the type of movie that requires seeing it two or three times to get a
good understanding of what is actually happening. At least if you rent
the movie, you can always rewind it and play it back if you didn&#x27;t
understand what the person was saying.
