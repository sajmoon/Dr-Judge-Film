2012_January 7 
i went to this movie after awesome word of mouth and i was not
disappointed..the acting and direction of movie is dead on and the
nuances had me engrossed for the total movie which went fast even
though it is quite long..the movie is not for the faint of heart but at
the same time how it is laid out in format there were two stories that
came together and it clicked on all levels..would recommend to anyone
to see this terrific movie..and i will add in the hands of a less
talented director unlike fincher this could have been a disaster and
this is why when he makes a movie i go and see for he is the best
director right now in my opinion
