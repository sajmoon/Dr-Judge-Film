The Swedish original of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Dir. David
Fincher, 2011), M&#xE4;n som hatar kvinnor (Dir. Niels Arden Oplev, 2009),
methodically followed the plot created by Stieg Larsson to almost the
exact word. This Hollywood remake did choose to leave out a few scenes
that had been included within the original, but with the film already
stretching at 2 hours 45 minutes I can forgive Fincher, as a fan of the
novel, for cutting out some of the final scenes from the film. <br /><br />The most unusual and off-putting part about the whole film were the
opening titles. They used a very James Bond-esc animation style where
both Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) and Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara)
are born from oil. Thankfully, the heavy metal soundtrack accompanying
the animation appeared to be the sort of music the character of Lisbeth
would enjoy. My opinion of the film was redeemed, as for a brief second
I had feared that Hollywood producers had taken control of the film and
created an action filled mystery; this was not the case. <br /><br />Every single actor within The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo created
individuals so similar to my imagination of the characters within
Larsson&#x27;s book that the film almost became a visual playback of my mind
when reading the novel. Daniel Craig played an excellent Mikael
Blomkvist but was unfortunately the only person who wasn&#x27;t seemingly
putting on a Swedish accent. The lack of accent wasn&#x27;t that noticeable
but it did make me raise questions as to Mikael Blomkvist&#x27;s origin.
Rooney Mara, in her protagonist debut, portrayed the girl with the
dragon tattoo with such charisma that any problems I&#x27;d had with Daniel
Craig&#x27;s character were forgotten while she was on screen. David Fincher
doesn&#x27;t always produce films of a high standard, but this one is one of
his greats. This movie has unusual protagonists, detestable villains
and a mystery that keeps people who haven&#x27;t read the book gripped till
the end. <br /><br />The only warning I have for anyone watching this film who knows nothing
about it is that it does include multiple uncomfortable scenes where at
least one of the protagonists finds themselves in a situation which is
difficult to watch. These said scenes are extremely well edited in
Fincher&#x27;s version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. They are abridged
in such a way to make any of the grotesque scenes within the film more
foreboding and uncomfortable. As an example, the first one of these
scenes cuts between Lisbeth and her guardian in his bedroom, and a slow
backwards zoom away from the door and down the corridor, making the
scene more ominous than it already was. <br /><br />Finally, the film does extend to 2 hours and 45 minutes. For someone
who enjoyed the novel it wasn&#x27;t quite long enough as the final scenes
within Australia have been cut to reduce time. But, I have been told,
that for someone fresh to the franchise the film does last too long, as
after the main plot has ended the film stretches on for 20 minutes into
a detailed conclusion, similar to the book. <br /><br />In conclusion, this film was definitely better than the Swedish
original as it had more personality, fantastic editing and a strong
cast. Many will question whether there was a need for a Hollywood
remake at all; and while the answer is no, I still believe that when
watching this film it provides a more Swedish vibe than the Swedish one
itself. The intoxicating acting of Rooney Mara keeps one engaged
throughout the whole film, and despite the accent, this film has
widened my eyes to the acting ability of Daniel Craig.
