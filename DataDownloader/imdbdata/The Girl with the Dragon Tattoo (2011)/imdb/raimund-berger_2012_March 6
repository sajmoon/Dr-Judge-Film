and even if they like to use a rather neutral term like &#x22;product
placement&#x22; it&#x27;s still just dumb advertising. So here&#x27;s some of the
companies I identified to have paid money for having their products
shown or names dropped ...<br /><br />Computer &#x26; Telco: Sony, Epson, Google, Apple, Nokia, ...<br /><br />Food, beverages and stuff: Coca Cola, Marlboro, some vodka brand I
couldn&#x27;t identify, Clinet wines, ...<br /><br />and the list goes on and on, of course.<br /><br />There&#x27;s some puzzlers though. Like why doesn&#x27;t her motor bike show a
model and company logo? Really confusing. Until Craig comes to drop his
obligatory line of course: &#x22;I used to have a motorcycle ...&#x22; - what? -
&#x22;... a ... Triumph.&#x22; YES!<br /><br />Thanks for meeting the expectations. And have fun counting all the
money.
