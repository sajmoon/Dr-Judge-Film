To the Book and Swedish Film fans, If have the ability to forget the
book AND the Breathtaking performance of Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth
Salander in the Swedish version of the movie you will ABSOLUTELY LOVE
this adaptation. I&#x27;m a HUGE fan of both but was able to quell the
inevitable comparisons and in doing so I was treated to a movie
experience not equaled since The Black Swan. David Fincher&#x27;s version is
beautiful, haunting, disturbing and altogether brilliant. And Rooney
Mara does an excellent, EXCELLENT job as Lisbeth Salander. Add on the
exceptional acting talents of Daniel Craig, Christopher Plummer and the
rest of the cast and it was definitely worth the price of admission.<br /><br />For those not familiar with the book or Swedish movie IT IS A MUST
SEE!!!!!!!! 5 stars!!!!!
