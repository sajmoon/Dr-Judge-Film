Strange thing, this Stieg Larsson-hype abroad. His books are very
Swedish and you have to live here to understand the social criticism
and the satire, which is also in them. Besides, Larsson writes from a
clearly politically left perspective. You find nothing of that here.<br /><br />Anyway, this is lame and stiff. It&#x27;s like just any average filmed crime
story and there are many like them. The actors certainly don&#x27;t behave
Swedish in any way, except for Lisbeth Sallander, who really hasn&#x27;t any
typical nationality at all. Not in the books and not here.<br /><br />It&#x27;s all made for the international market, which doesn&#x27;t stop the
Swedish version to be the better adaptation.
