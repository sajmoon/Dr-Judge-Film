First of all all the hype created around The Girl with the Dragon
Tattoo is nothing other than a waste of time and money. The Girl with
the Dragon Tattoo doesn&#x27;t live up to the high expectation of the people
. Rather it falls flat . As the promos and the preview suggest , th
story is about Lisbeth Salander. A con artist ,a thief who is capable
enough to open any lock , in any place of the world, let that be on a
flying plane or a running train. the story revolves around how she
undertakes a job to rob a running train containing 10,000 kilograms ,
worth antiques.<br /><br />well , routed to be as one of the biggest hits of 2011, The Girl with
the Dragon Tattoo turns out to be one of the biggest flops of the year
joining Ravaan and Kites.With silly one liners and awful con tricks The
Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is one of the worst con movies i have ever
seen till date. With a little or no use of the acting skills of Rooney
Mara and Daniel Craig , David Fincher wastes them totally.the only
interesting part of the movie is the rape issue that might drag the
audiences to the theaters but if you take my opinion friends don&#x27;t go
for it if you have no intentions of wasting your money and time on one
of the awfully scripted,directed movies of all time.Trust me, it
doesn&#x27;t live up to it at all.<br /><br />verdict: An insult to the original classic and utter mockery of loved
characters of the Original Novel. it is acceptable to watch it only if
you have free time in abundance. I give it 3/10
