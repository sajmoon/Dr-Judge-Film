2012_January 17 
Admittedly, 2011 did not have much to offer in terms of outstanding
movies. There were some decent titles, but the majority of the movies,
actors, actresses, etc nominated for Golden Globes and rumored Oscars
simply felt undeserving. In order to be appreciated for such awards, I
always used to think something extraordinary needed to be produced, and
unfortunately this year, I felt like that was not so.<br /><br />The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is the only extraordinary film I have
watched of 2011. It delivers superb acting, brilliant storytelling and
script, and unprecedented directing.<br /><br />David Fincher has long been a favourite director of mine, with
classical titles such as Se7en, Fight Club and Zodiac to name a few.
After a rather over hyped Benjamin Button, I felt like Fincher really
redeemed himself here. Dragon Tattoo manages to capture the suspense
and thrill of Zodiac, but through a different perspective in a
different world.<br /><br />Probably the best part about this movie is that you can have zero
knowledge about the book and the previous Swedish version and still
walk out amazed.<br /><br />For whatever unknown reason, I believe Dragon Tattoo is just short of a
masterpiece, the only reason being why I didn&#x27;t give it a 10. However,
as stated before, it is easily the best of 2011. If it was up to me, it
would get the directing, script and actress Oscars without question.
I&#x27;m disappointed to see this movie merely as an underdog at the Oscars
as opposed to an &#x22;expected&#x22; nomination/prediction. It deserves much
more credit given the mediocre standard of movies produced in 2011.
