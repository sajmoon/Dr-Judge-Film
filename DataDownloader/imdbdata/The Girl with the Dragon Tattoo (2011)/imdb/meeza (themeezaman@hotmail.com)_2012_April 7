2012_April 7 
I wish I could start my review of David Fincher&#x27;s &#x22;The Girl with the
Dragon Tattoo&#x22; as riveting as the film&#x27;s infamous &#x22;Immigrant Song&#x22;
opening. But I am foreign to those type of stellar intros unless there
are plenty of corny puns on the menu. Many, including yours truly,
thought there was no need to make American versions of the 2009 Swedish
film franchise which was adapted from Stieg Larsson&#x27;s best-seller
Swedish novels. But since it would have the Fincherprints of the master
auteur David Fincher, I thought maybe it would turnout alright; and it
sure did! At least, the first installment did. David Fincher&#x27;s version
of &#x22;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#x22; is simply one of the best films of
2011. For those of you who are not familiar with the premise, I will
ink it for you. It is about a disgraced Swedish journalist named Mikael
Blomkvist who gets hired by a wealthy Swedish geriatric billionaire
named Henrik Vanger to investigate the 40-year-old mystery of the
disappearance of his granddaughter Harriet; her case was unsolved and
her body was never found, so Vanger wants someone to do a bang-up job
and finally solve the mystery. Henrik is even suspicious that someone
from his Vanger familial bunch was responsible for Harriet&#x27;s
disappearance. In return, Blomkvist gets mucho cashola and undisclosed
information from Henrik about the corporate magnet that Mikael has been
trying to pin for many years. So how does that chic with that dragon
pic in her skin fit into the picture? In mucho ways! Lisbeth Salander
is the name, computer hacking is the game, and her Gothic fashion is
not lame. And by the way, you don&#x27;t want to make a sexual move on a
first date with this Salander Girl, or else you will be sorry; just ask
her monstrous welfare officer Nils Bjurman. I will just leave it at
that, and if you have not seen it, I will be hush about Lisbeth&#x27;s
vengeful show on not-Nine Inch Nils (a little kudos there also to Trent
Reznor of Nine Inch Nails and movie composer pal Atticus Ross for
another mesmeric score to a Fincher flick). Lisbeth who knows all about
Blomkvist due to her hacking ways, eventually teams up with him to try
to solve the Harriet disappearance. Fincher&#x27;s well-tuned directorial
techniques were very pulsating throughout the Tattoo picture, and
Oscar-winning screenwriter Steven Zaillian&#x27;s Tattoo scribe read very
well in its verbal intercourse. As much as I loved the Fincher and the
Zaillian&#x27;s labor efforts to the Tattoo, my favorite contributor to this
movie was that of Rooney Mara&#x27;s tour-de-force starring performance as
Lisbeth Salander. Let&#x27;s just say that Rooney Mara was a giant among
scene- steelers throughout the movie. Daniel Craig&#x27;s performance as
Blomkvist was spectacular and there is nothing to libel about that
sentiment. Christopher Plummer turned out another great performance as
Henrik Vanger from this now Oscar-winner veteran thespian. The steady
Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgard was stellar as Harriet&#x27;s brother Martin
Vanger. Kudos also goes out to Robin Wright&#x27;s right-on work as
Blomkvist&#x27;s lover and boss Erika Berger. And this Joel has to commend a
Joely of course; because Joely Richardson turned out a genuine
supporting performance as one of the Banger women, Anita Banger; say
Anita Banger five times real quick; just saying. I see now why Kirk
Baxter and Angus Wall picked up yet another Best Film Editing Oscar in
a Fincher movie; because just from the film&#x27;s opening, you know they
were going to be immigrating to the Oscar stage. &#x22;The Girl with the
Dragon Tattoo&#x22; might not fully- capture you in its initial viewing
(especially if you have read the novel or seen the Swedish film version
since you know what is going to happen), but this Fincherpiece will
stay in your mind and there is Mara of where that came from. *****
Excellent
