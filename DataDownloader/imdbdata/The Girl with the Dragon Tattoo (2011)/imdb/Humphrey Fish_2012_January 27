I saw able to see this movie in the theater, and now I am going to
review it. Before I get going, I&#x27;ll have you know that I saw the
Swedish version after I saw this. Now what&#x27;s my opinion on this film?
Here it is, this movie is one of the best movies of 2011! That&#x27;s right,
I enjoyed this movie a whole lot, I enjoyed it all the way through from
start to finish, I enjoyed all 153 minutes of it! This movie is top
entertainment, it is electrifying, and it is just as good as the
Swedish version, it&#x27;s a great time! When the movie was over, I felt
like paying for another ticket, getting more popcorn and soda, walking
right back into the theater, and watching the movie all the way through
a second time. This movie is as good as it gets, the action is fast
paced, there is a lot of excitement, not to mention a lot of thrills as
well! This movie is one of the best movies that I have ever seen in the
theater, it is a thrilling, suspenseful, and not to mention, an
exciting masterpiece! This movie is also one of the best movies I&#x27;ve
seen in quite a long time, repeating what I said, it&#x27;s a thrilling
masterpiece!<br /><br />Daniel Craig (of James Bond fame) plays Mikael Blomkvist a journalist
who is aided in his search for a woman who has been missing for forty
years by Lisbeth Salander (played by Rooney Mara), a young computer
hacker. I was so surprised to see Daniel Craig in this movie, as I have
only seen him two other movies, Casino Royale and Quantam Of Solace.
Well I&#x27;m glad that he&#x27;s in this movie, because he certainly did a great
job! But the biggest praise goes to Rooney Mara, her performance was
something else. Her performance is probably one of the best
performances that I have seen from a young actress, that part was
perfect for her, she played it so perfectly. Not to mention that David
Fincher did a fabulous job at directing this movie, he directs this
movie was perfection, nobody could have done a better job at directing
this movie than him, not even Martin Scorsese could have done a better
job. The great acting and directing are major benefits of this movie,
not to mention the plot is something as well!<br /><br />Well all in all, this movie is one of the best films of 2011, and
another one of the best films that I have seen at the theater. Am I
glad that I watched this movie? Oh yes I am glad that I watched this
movie, because I certainly had a wonderful time watching it and being
thrilled by it! If you loved the Swedish version, then you will also
love this movie, it&#x27;s an action-packed thrill ride that will really
electrify you! I have seen both this version and the Swedish version,
and they both are movies that are among some of the best I&#x27;ve seen
recently, they are both modern film masterpieces! This movie is
exciting, thrilling, electrifying, and not to mention, unforgettable. I
am probably going to have to watch this movie a few more times just for
the sheer entertainment! So in short, this movie is a very fabulous
movie and is one of the best films of 2011, don&#x27;t miss it, because the
results are really something to see!<br /><br />10/10
