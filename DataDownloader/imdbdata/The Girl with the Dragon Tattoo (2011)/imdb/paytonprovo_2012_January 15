Where do I start, the movie was amazing. Daniel Craig was great and
Rooney Mara put on one of the best performances I&#x27;ve seen in a while.
The plot was great, David Fincher is my favorite directors. There were
many subplots that made the characters what they were and who they
were. It definitely was a detective movie that showed how they found
information. I think that how they had the family made a comical touch.
I believe this is a best motion picture and it should win. There was
good suspense and action and I love the part where the serial killer is
revealed. I&#x27;m not going to spoil the movie for anyone because this is
worth going to the movies and then buying it on DVD. I want to see
David Fincher make the other 2 movies because this was fenominal.
