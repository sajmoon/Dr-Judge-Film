(Spoiler alerts throughout) This film appears to offer a story of
consequences and revenge; at least that is how it first appears. What
it really offers is a platform for relentless gender assaults against
men. (Spoiler Alert)For instance: after experiencing sexual
molestation, the girl with dragon tattoo then visits the molester&#x27;s
home and when that turns out to be a mistake, returns a third time to
affect revenge and to brutalize the molester. Does she see that justice
is done? No. What she does is return to torture the man and release him
right back out into the world where he can continue his behavior where
she can then continue to brutalize him. The first time made him a
villain and a fiend. I get that. The second time makes HER stupid and
reckless while the third, premeditated visit, makes her a villain as
big a villain as him.<br /><br />A short time later she comes onto Daniel Craig&#x27;s character and then
literally jumps on top of him against his wishes. No means no. Right?
Not if your the girl with dragon tattoo. That&#x27;s a double standard
folks. Be smarter than this movie. <br /><br />Through the course of the story there were no men who were not
emasculated or vilified. Frankly, I was horrified, as much by the
gleeful reactions of some viewers as I was by the piteous actions of
the story&#x27;s unlikely protagonist.<br /><br />A far as the actual story telling. It was uninspired, milling back and
forth between TGWTDT looking at her lap top and DC staring at photos.
The problem is, who really knows what they were looking at and seeing.
It was just boring. I know, you will say it was clearer in the book.
But you know what? I didn&#x27;t drop $10 to watch the book. I dropped the
cash to see the film. I wish I didn&#x27;t. I hope you don&#x27;t either. If
given the choice, watch Sharktopus instead. At least you will not be
surprised by the quality.
