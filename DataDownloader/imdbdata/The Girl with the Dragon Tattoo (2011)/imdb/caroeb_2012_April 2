David Fincher (director) and Steven Zaillian (screenplay) accomplish a
solid, if limited, vision of Stieg Larsson&#x27;s internationally acclaimed
novel. If that required making a dark cartoon of the title character,
she&#x27;s an unusually interesting one that apparently appealed to the
filmmakers: the underdog/heroine with ready-made (by Larsson) makeup,
wardrobe, and &#x22;attitude.&#x22; With a personal story that could be tweaked
to &#x22;keep it simple&#x22; but is, by its nature, compelling. No worries about
a sequel; &#x22;Lisbeth&#x27;s&#x22; story is tweaked into movie-style completion in
this film. Something about international high finance to gratify
&#x22;Lisbeth&#x22; before she rides into the sunset on her motorcycle.<br /><br />If Rooney Mara&#x27;s acting struck me as robotic, where&#x27;s the harm?
&#x22;Lisbeth&#x22; = &#x22;tough;&#x22; robots = &#x22;tough.&#x22; To add a little - realism, is
it? - she doesn&#x27;t have to act just a little &#x22;vulnerable,&#x22; she just
moves through the plot element emphasized by the filmmakers to imply
that she is, a little. Within their vision, a glaringly unrealistic
element, in my opinion. And her halo slips while she viciously performs
an unnecessary cruelty. But we suspend our better judgements when we
are watching a cartoon, anyway. No big deal.<br /><br />Tweak the internationally acclaimed plot a little more, and the
respected investigative reporter, &#x22;Mikael&#x22;/Daniel Craig becomes the
(surprisingly well acted) perfect foil, an absent-minded professor type
who bumbles his way through his part in an investigation while our
heroine saves the day. (To make sure we don&#x27;t miss his bumbling,
Stellan Skarsg&#xE5;rd&#x27;s character calls attention to his idiotic behavior,
chalking it up to human foibles). No point in throwing out the
investigation of a decades-old mystery completely, as it adds its own
&#x22;spice&#x22; to the titillating mix. Besides, it&#x27;s a ready-made (by Larsson)
way to bring in &#x22;Mikael&#x22;/Daniel to elicit &#x22;Lisbeth&#x22;/Rooney&#x27;s
&#x22;vulnerability.&#x22; But no need to dwell on any details of why/how two
seemingly unlikely, previously unacquainted people manage to solve an
&#x22;unsolvable&#x22; mystery. (BTW, Chris Plummer overacts his part: he brings
poignancy and gravitas to this throwaway &#x22;sub&#x22;plot).<br /><br />I did mind the film editing, which unbelievably won the 2012 Oscar. But
if you&#x27;re already familiar with this story and you keep your wits about
you, or if you use mind-enhancing drugs, you should be able to follow
along some of the rushed through, chopped up plot elements chosen by
the filmmakers to sort-of-include in this tale.<br /><br />Overall, if you don&#x27;t find the caricaturization of a punk &#x22;tough
cookie&#x22; to be offensive, you should find this movie enjoyable. Sort of
like a &#x22;real-life&#x22; Batman ensemble, with very nasty sex. If you might
prefer characterization over caricaturization, and a story of two
excellent and complementary detectives, the Swedish film of TGWTDT is
for you.
