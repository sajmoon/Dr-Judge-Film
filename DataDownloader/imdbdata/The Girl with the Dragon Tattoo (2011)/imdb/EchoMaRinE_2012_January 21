As a person that read the book and watched the Swedish version of the
movie, my first conclusion is people rated this movie without watching.
I am not saying the movie is bad but considering the book, it is just
fine (even at the edge of fine). The character development phase is
ultra lame. I watched the movie with couple of friends and at the end
they had a lot of questions in mind. Considering the length of the
movie, one can easily judge how bad the script was. There were so many
useless details (and yeah, I read the other two books as well. I know
what I am talking about). If you sum up the time spent on details
neither necessary for this movie nor the rest of the series, one could
use that time to tell the story properly. Lets talk about the positive
sides as well. The script follows the book in an OK manner (but towards
the ending I guess the script writer got bored). On the other hand,
everything is so rushed. I must say, the scenery is well portrait.
Lastly, I need to warn you about the adult content as well. This is
simply not a family movie. As a conclusion, an OK movie but not a
masterpiece or what so ever.
