The Girl with a Dragoon Tattoo is another best-seller title taken by
US/UK filmmakers and adopted for Hollywood standards. High budget,
celebrity actors and big big commercial campaign to pump up cinema
views. I am a big fan of the whole trilogy and beside second part I&#x27;ve
drown completely in the story and in the characters. Being curious of
new, commercial adaptation I wanted to check by myself if all these
critic&#x27;s reviews aren&#x27;t just another cinema campaign. And sadly I can
say- they are... which is really frequent nowadays.<br /><br />First impression- main plan characters:<br /><br />Daniel Craig as Mikael Blomkvist- I didn&#x27;t like him as a new James Bond
for that, that he looks like and act like Russian gangster not a
British spy-gentlemen and I can say that also in GWDT he lacks of a
style and doesn&#x27;t fit for a soft role of journalist. Couldn&#x27;t really
feel his pain for loosing trial, nor even his fear to die at the last
scene. He really is a great fit for relentless characters (eg. Cowboys
and Aliens) but not for a emotional ones. Mikael Nyqvist was much much
more natural in his role.I think even Sean Bean would fit better here. <br /><br />Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander- gosh, when I first seen her I thought
she&#x27;s a ghoul. Noomi Rapace beside that she was self-confident
outsider, angry on whole world, hating all the man for what she came
through in her childhood- she was also dragging attention- pretty hot
punk girl. Full of emotions, building interest and questions who she
is. In Fincher&#x27;s film- Rooney Mara looks unnatural and not attractive
at all so I simply don&#x27;t care (maybe it&#x27;s chauvinist point of view but
it is how this world works). With all this punk-sadomasochism style-
yet again she lacks natural expression and her role looks a bit
artificial and flat. <br /><br />Scenes: Like a characters- whole film looks for me artificially- I
think the reason for that is that makers were following a Swedish
script and were interlacing English actors with Swedish ones and
Swedish world. I really would much more appreciate a brand new story
based on the book but in the new realities and new world (for sure
watching Swedish version strips the film of novelty). Film seemed to be
a cover of a popular album- playing the same song with a new, foreign
artists. All like original but without a freshness and with dose of
exotic accents. Background music was really pompous and was only
covering the silence. Couldn&#x27;t feel that it was building emotions to
the scenes. <br /><br />Was it worthy going to cinema then? Yes. Despite all the acting and
photography, script- it&#x27;s still a good movie- emotions are rather built
on the investigation progress- and even if it feels like the action
goes too quickly ahead (because of lack of &#x22;interaction&#x22; with a
characters) you still feel excitement with a new discoveries. It is
definitely not as good as an original and not as good as you can read
on the other reviews... but I don&#x27;t regret going to cinema- rather
because I have seen another adaptation of very good film, not because I
have seen very good film.
