I saw the movie last night. First of all; I admit I was biased going in
( in favor of the original Swedish film; why remake a movie made only 2
years ago? ), but they seemed torn between the native language for the
scenery, and English for most of the computer screens. And I admit it
has been a while since I read the book, but they could have spent a
little more time on how Lizbet go they way she was.<br /><br />Like the book ( and the Swedish original ) it was a little distracting
bouncing back and forth between Blomqvest&#x27;s story and Salander&#x27;s until
they merged, but the plots ( plural ) were very well done.<br /><br />And other than to save a little money, I&#x27; not sure why they left out
the part about Australia ( I&#x27;m putting this intentionally a little
vague to prevent a spoiler for those who have not read the book ). <br /><br />Others seem to prefer this to the original; I am not convinced the
acting was any better. I have to recommend the original Swedish film on
DVD.
