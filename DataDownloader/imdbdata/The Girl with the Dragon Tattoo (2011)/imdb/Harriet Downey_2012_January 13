I have to say, and I am ashamed for doing so, but I haven&#x27;t seen the
original trilogy or even read the books. I know, slap on the wrists, if
not a slap on the face. Yet after seeing this film, I&#x27;ve been looking
at buying the box-set of the Swedish version, I&#x27;m hooked.<br /><br />The title sequence seemed to me like a more disturbing Bond, especially
with Daniel Craig appearing. I suppose the fact that they were a tad
disturbing, should have set me up for a couple of hours of me shying
away from the screen, to be honest, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve got the stomach
for it. The acting from both Craig and Rooney Mara along with the
impeccable story line made me stay.<br /><br />Apart from the few unsettling moments, it is very frank and candid,
creating a funny repartee between Craig and Mara. There&#x27;s so many
questions and so much going on but I never once found myself bewildered
by any of it, that&#x27;s good storytelling.
