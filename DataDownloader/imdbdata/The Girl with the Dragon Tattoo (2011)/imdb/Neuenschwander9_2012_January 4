Oh dear. I know democracy is good, is something positive even if not
perfect. Nevertheless, when I see here all the shinning comments about
this abnormal movie I just want to putsh over IMDb and play Pinochet
for a while until all those stars are wiped out for good.<br /><br />Fincher, Fincher, Fincher... not even your genius, not even your
brilliant insights can save this aberration. Why to take part in such a
stupid project? Please, I want to know why??? I demand to know!
Absolutely below all B movie standards. They probably thought &#x22;let&#x27;s
mix Fincher with some pretty faces and asses and with some crazy
directing moves and we got ourselves a movie&#x22;. Instead, what we got was
something to throw in the nearest trash bin. What he got was a complete
failure, a mess without plot, without decent actors, without ideas,
without consistence. What he did was to copy the traditional teen
horror movie already seen ten thousand times before, arrange some fancy
scenarios with lots of dolls, kidnap Rooney Mara until Daniel Craig
agreed to jump into the project and VOIL&#xC1;! You got yourself the
bullshit movie of the year.<br /><br />Avoid this movie with all your strengths, even if you adore the
sell-out phase of Fincher&#x27;s career, like me.
