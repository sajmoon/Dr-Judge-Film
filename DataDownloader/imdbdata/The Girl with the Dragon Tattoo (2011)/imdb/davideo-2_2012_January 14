STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning
** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Swedish journalist Mikhael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) has had his
credibility shattered after losing a court case brought against him by
a giant corporation for printing an alleged in-truth. With his career
hanging in the balance, Mikhael accepts an offer from an eccentric man
named Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to locate a girl who went
missing over forty years ago. As he digs deeper into the case, he
uncovers a pattern of serial killings that may hint at the girls
disappearance, as well as a dysfunctional family that want to tear each
other&#x27;s throats out. Mikhael finds he must join forces with troubled,
socially awkward freelance journalist Lisbeth (Rooney Mara) who was
involved in gaining insider information about him to his enemies in
court, in order to get on top of a deadly net that&#x27;s closing in on him.<br /><br />Not a town known for it&#x27;s creativity and original ideas (and, with a
recession blazing, even more so) Hollywood has a history of adapting
foreign films that have gained a cult status (that it&#x27;s dubious whether
they&#x27;d have got had they actually been from there originally) and
turning them into bigger budget productions that are often, to say the
least, not as good as their source material. Thankfully, this is not
the case with David Fincher&#x27;s adaptation of Sieg Larson&#x27;s The Girl With
the Dragon Tattoo, the first of what promises to be a trilogy of
adaptations of novels in the series.<br /><br />Having seen the original film, and been impressed with the visceral way
it gets under your skin, there were few genuine surprises in store for
me here in the way the story pans out, but it remains a compelling
murder mystery, as well as a dark, unflinching glare into the heart and
mind of a serial killer, which Fincher handles the way he&#x27;s handled
similar themes before in films such as Zodiac and Se7en. The Hollywood
style has naturally granted it a sleeker, glossier look than it&#x27;s
Swedish inspiration, but it still maintains a dark veneer through out,
which is matched by the style and the soundtrack.<br /><br />Performances wise, Craig is an inspired choice in the lead role, his
intense acting style perfect for the role, while Mara is a revelation
as the unfriendly, unsociable but troubled and sympathetic young woman.
Since they&#x27;re the main driving force of the story, it&#x27;s fitting they&#x27;re
all playing related characters, but as the support cast the likes of
Plummer, Stellan Skarsgard and Joely Richardson are a credit too,
really creating the impression of a family where everyone hates each
other&#x27;s guts and each are holding secrets from each other that could
serve to shatter.<br /><br />With a 158 minute running time, and having to live up to the standards
of such great source material, Fincher&#x27;s film would have to pull a real
cat out of the bag to work and, thankfully, it&#x27;s done it, the first
Hollywood slant on a series of works that will hopefully set the tone
for the rest. ****
