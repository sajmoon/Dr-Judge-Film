First of all let me call Lizbeth the Wild Wonder Woman. She is
certainly wild with the hair, clothes and stainless steel and she is a
bit of a wonder with her ability to take over any computer on the
planet. Also all the computers that she takes over belong to people who
keep their whole lives on their laptops including their banking
records, their life&#x27;s history,the codes to their accounts in the Cayman
Islands etc.It&#x27;s all there waiting for WWW. Also she has a wonderful
relationship with various police forces, all she has to do is walk in
and ask for what she wants and she gets it. Certainly a WWW.<br /><br />Christopher Plummer&#x27;s offspring disappeared 40 years ago and he has
decided that she is dead and not only that but murdered by a member of
the family and he has devoted the 40 years to unmasking the killer
without result. So he calls in Daniel to solve the mystery.<br /><br />The problem with this is that there is no reasonable cause or rationale
for making this assumption. So you have to see it as a plot facilitator
and a poor one.<br /><br />Daniel&#x27;s investigation proceeds with Lizbeth&#x27;s help and seems to
consist mainly of looking at old photos. <br /><br />No divulging of the ending but there is the identification of a couple
of serial killers which makes as much sense as Curly did in the Three
Stooges. All together way too long and a waste of your time.
