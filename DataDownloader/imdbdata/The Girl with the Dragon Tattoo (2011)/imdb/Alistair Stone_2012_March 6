Okay but nothing compared to the original. <br /><br />Whilst watching this American version I kept finding excuses to go make
a cup of tea or toilet or something. This never happens in the original
and I have watched it countless times for its sheer brilliance. <br /><br />Once you watch the original, you will find it hard to like this
version. I don&#x27;t blame the cast. They tried. But I found it hard to
believe they were Swedish. They spoke quickly and the new scenes just
didn&#x27;t work for me. They didn&#x27;t fit into their roles. And i&#x27;m not just
talking about the lead characters. The only good character was
lisbeth&#x27;s guardian as he didn&#x27;t talk. It just lacked the finesse of the
first film. <br /><br />If you haven&#x27;t yet watched the original then you are missing out on a
great film.
