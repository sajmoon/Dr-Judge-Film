David Fincher never fails me, even including the underwhelming THE
CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON (2008) (which I think I seriously need
a re-watch), the American remake of THWTDT is as excellent as its
Swedish archetype if not excels in every aspect. <br /><br />Karen O&#x27;s Led Zeppelin cover Immigrant Song serves as the explosive
opening track and dovetails with Fincher&#x27;s surreal MV-esque opening
credit, instantly enhancing the thrill upon to an adrenaline-driven
index, eye-dashing, jaw-dropping, so up-to-the-minute yet bespeaks its
own attitude, a thriller hipster for this age. <br /><br />The storyline slightly differs from the original Sweden version (the
ending is more agreeable for me, a sympathetic outline of Lisbeth
plainly strengthens her character with additional authenticity and
pathos. I also prefer the cast in this American version, Daniel Craig
manages to embellish his rugged complexion with an anti-Bond
vulnerability and a morally passive average-Joe journalist,
subjectively I opt him over Michael Nyqvist. As for Rooney Mara, under
Fincher&#x27;s guidance, her Tomboy bent (inwardly in particular) has been
exploited to an uppermost bloom, the rape-and-vengeance scenes are the
aces in the hole (with a more genial appearance of the pervert by
Yorick van Wageningen), compared to Noomi Rapace, I just admire Mara
more and it&#x27;s super to see her to re-enact such a ground-breaking
female role fervently and sparks dynamically in just 2 years. I must
say she is a more attractive girl to any extent . Among the supporting
group, Stellan is creepily swell and happy to see a Penn-free Robin
Wright with her new look, fringe does make a difference! <br /><br />Trent &#x26; Atticus Ross&#x27; score is another feat (after a victory foray in
THE SOCIAL NETWORK 2010 with new buddy Fincher), the pervasive,
humming, quasi-vibration background soundtrack is like a prolonged
Post-Rock/Experimental album, highlights the narrative turbulence along
the way, until the notoriously basement scene about slaughter fetish.
Also Jeff Cronenweth&#x27;s stunning cinematography is another Oscar-bait,
good luck on the Oscars, after snagging a surprising DGA nomination for
Fincher and a steady Box Officer implementation, I hope it could make
some upheaval in this year&#x27;s languid Oscar race.
