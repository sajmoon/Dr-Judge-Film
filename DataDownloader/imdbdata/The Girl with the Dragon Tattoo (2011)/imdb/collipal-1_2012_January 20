I don&#x27;t know how necessary this remake was, but something is true about
it: the perfect director was chosen to take to the big screen author
Stieg Larsson (1954-2004)&#x27;s famous book The Girl With the Dragon
Tattoo, whose sordid elements could have degenerated into a feast of
excesses; but under David Fincher&#x27;s brilliant direction, The Girl with
the Dragon Tattoo (2011) keeps a sober and controlled tone which slowly
increases the tension until leading to a memorable ending.<br /><br />As the first part of a trilogy, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)
takes its time to establish the characters, not only in their attitudes
and nature, but also on the very different contexts which round them;
and even though the central mystery is very interesting, the best thing
about this film is gradually meeting the main characters, contrasting
their methods, personalities, and the reactions they have in front of
the discoveries of the investigation. And then we have the excellent
performances from the cast, starting by Daniel Craig, who displays the
ability to &#x22;think on camera&#x22;, letting us to see in his eyes and
expressions all the things that are going through in his character&#x27;s
mind. Rooney Mara makes an extraordinary work as Lisbeth Salander,
which is in my humble opinion, as intense and credible as the one
brought by Noomi Rapace in the original film. The supporting actors
also bring perfect performances, highlighting Steven Berkoff, who makes
a simultaneously subtle and detailed work; and Yorick Van Wageningen as
Lisbeth&#x27;s legal guardian, a disgusting character the actor could
humanize despite his horrible actions.<br /><br />As for Fincher, I hugely enjoyed the way in which he displays
meticulously planned scenes, but without extinguishing the spontaneity
of the performances nor the tension from the story. For fans of the
book or the original film (like me), I have to say that there are some
substantial changes in this new interpretation, but that does not make
this movie bad at all; it just makes it different. And I also have to
warn that the film might feel excessively slow for the people who
expected a typical Hollywood thriller full of action and violence. I
admire the fact that Fincher had the conviction of showing the
characters in a passive reflection, or thoughtfully looking at the
computer for long whiles...but all the audiences might not accept the
challenge of paying attention to every single detail from the
investigation, and they might be disappointed by the fact that the
movie refuses to present us the story pre-digested to our comfort.<br /><br />In conclusion, I enthusiastically recommend The Girl with the Dragon
Tattoo (2011) because, independently from the book and the original
film, I think it is an excellent film on its own right, which kept me
fascinated and very entertained the whole time because of its big
number of attributes.
