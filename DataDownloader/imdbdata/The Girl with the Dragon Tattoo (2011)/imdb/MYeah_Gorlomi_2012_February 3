The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is David Fincher&#x27;s follow up to The
Social Network. It had some serious hype behind it, and for the most
part, lived up to it. The movie begins with promise in the form of a
stellar opening credits sequence (They had me at Karen O.), and leads
into a very unnerving two and a half hours of suspense and mystery.<br /><br />The movie has to juggle together the narratives of Mikael Blomkvist and
Lisbeth Salander. This type of back and forth cross cutting between the
two is a bit on the uneven side, but when David Fincher&#x27;s involved,
such a thing can be expected, and forgiven. From head to toe, this is a
Fincher film, and it&#x27;s probably his most brutal film since Fight Club,
so it&#x27;s never an easy watch. He&#x27;s enlisted expert crafts people that
nail his style, including Jeff Cronenweth&#x27;s brooding, sometimes
claustrophobic cinematography, and a moody (if at times grating and
overplayed) score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross that works nicely in
the film (Thanks more to Fincher and his music editor than the
composing duo), but makes a hideous listen as a stand alone.<br /><br />Though I praise Fincher&#x27;s direction, I still have issues with the
script and with the pacing. I don&#x27;t always think the script quite ties
everything together as well as it should, but that may have a bit more
to do with the editing. It&#x27;s not that Angus Wall and Kirk Baxter&#x27;s work
is bad, In fact, it&#x27;s actually good stuff. But the second hour of the
film tends to drag, as does the ending, which goes on much longer than
it needs to. I&#x27;m willing to be forgiving up to a certain point, but
Fincher was really trying my patience.<br /><br />Oh well, you can at least say that it wasn&#x27;t a wasted experience, if
only because Rooney Mara is spectacular in this movie. She not only
looks the part for Lisbeth Salander (complete with excellent makeup),
she vanishes into the role. This character is troubled, sexual,
intelligent, and completely scary. Mara manages to convey subtle,
filtered emotions, also topped with the occasional humorous sprinkle,
to the point that I forgot that she was even acting. Undoubtedly one of
the best characters of 2011.<br /><br />*** out of ****
