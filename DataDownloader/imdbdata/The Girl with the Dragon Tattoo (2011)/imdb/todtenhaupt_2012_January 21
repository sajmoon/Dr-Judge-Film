This is a very fine movie by David Fincher. It does live up to the
medias expectation. The movie greets you with an extraordinary intro,
the kind of high octane pictures one expects from a Bond movie.
Beginning and end, a cliffhanger in the emotional sense are both finely
crafted. Once the participants are established the plot runs its
underailed course. Craig displays the curious but tarnished
investigator on a limp, Mara is the taciturn girl genius tipping the
scales. <br /><br />This movie can be looked at from two perspectives: an American and a
European. While the American version is honed to please the semi-savy
blockbuster crowd, another Fincher that regurgitates Larsons book One
in a digestible way, the ever depressed Europeans might find it
lacking.<br /><br />Marrow and grit where leached from the deep-set reality that middle
class is craving for when they commit to an evening of crime. Don&#x27;t
complicate your life watching the original, it will leave you even more
distressed.
