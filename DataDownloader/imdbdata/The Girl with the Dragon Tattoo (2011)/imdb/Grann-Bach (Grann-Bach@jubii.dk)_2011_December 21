Mikael Blomkvist has been convicted of libel against Wennerstr&#xF6;m(whose
pretty much only perceived as a villain in this, one of the few
arguable failures of this) and the fee he has to pay costs him his life
savings. So when he is offered a large pay, as well as the inside scoop
on his nemesis, he agrees to, in return, try to solve the 40-year-old
disappearance case of the daughter of Henrik Vanger, the retiring and
dying leader of the concern named after him. The suspects? His entire
family. The wealth and power is alluring, after all. He is aided by the
Goth hacker, Lisbeth. I didn&#x27;t think I was going to say this,
especially because I loved Rapace&#x27;s performance, but Rooney Mara *is*
Salander. The mannerisms, the anti-social behaviour, the voice,
everything, spot-on. This is the far more interesting(and emotionally
involving, both her to us and her with others) take on her(like other
things in this, it&#x27;s deeper), such as the clear Asperger&#x27;s Syndrome
aspects to her(not present in the other one). These are not hammered
home, they are there and if you know what they are, you&#x27;ll see them.
They come naturally to this, as many other things in this. This is not
a remake or Americanization of the Swedish film, it is a fresh
adaptation of the novel, and without having read it, even I knew things
that that one missed, and they are in this, and this is all the better
for it. This is far superior to that one; while not in every single
respect, the things where they match or this is lesser are
insignificant in amount and/or scope. One negative that is perhaps
noteworthy is that not only was this shot where it&#x27;s set, no, they went
the extra mile with Swedish pronounciation and poorly attempted
accents, and this is awkward and requires getting used to. This doesn&#x27;t
convey the isolation, however, in its place is the freezing cold. The
theme of men of authority who hate women and make them suffer is
explored well. This doesn&#x27;t remove anything that was extreme in the
original, rather, it makes them even stronger. It is a brutal,
disturbing, sexually perverted tragedy with a moderate amount of
swearing. The ending and opening(reminiscent of that of Fight Club) are
infinitely greater, and leave an imprint on you. I don&#x27;t know how,
since this isn&#x27;t much longer, though this definitely fits in a lot
more, and has a richness of detail that the &#x27;09 one lacks(and while I
know that those were meant to be a mini-series, I&#x27;d say this is the
better approach, separating the installments and not making them all at
once). This has a good mystery, if I&#x27;m unsure if the hints towards the
solution are excessive or not. I recommend this to anyone who might
like it(be sure to know what you&#x27;re in for, this pulls no punches).
