Having just seen the film I am at a loss as to why so many critics have
given it a positive review.<br /><br />I hated the product placement........Rooney Mara was way out of her
depth.............the script buried the story with a who&#x27;s-who of the
family........it also included some of the original book&#x27;s sub-plots
(which the Swedish version quite rightly left out)...I thought the
&#x27;jokey&#x27; chat between Lisbeth and Mikael laboured............the title
sequence would have been better attached to an &#x27;Alien 5&#x27;...I could go
on..as for the changed end, actually I missed it as I walked out while
Lisbeth and Mikael were following someones computer activity....another
attempt at humour (Amazon,Solitaire) (I have seen the original
(Extended Version) and can honestly say that it is far better.)<br /><br />PS 04/01/2012 Watched the original again tonight....No contest :-)
