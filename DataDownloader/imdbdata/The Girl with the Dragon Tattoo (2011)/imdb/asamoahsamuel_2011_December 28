I haven&#x27;t read the books. I have seen the original Swedish film series
and loved every single one of them. Especially the first film which I
thought was brilliant. Knowing David Fincher was up to direct this
version had me waiting with baited breath at the outcome. I&#x27;m more than
happy to say that Fincher&#x27;s version is equally as brilliant. Whether or
not he&#x27;ll direct the rest of the series (if approved) we&#x27;ll just have
to wait to wait and see. If yes, then this is a fantastic opener from
one of the best directors in the business.<br /><br />Daniel Craig gives a solid performance as Mikael Blomkvist, the
disgraced journalist. Had my doubts about Craig after watching the
dreadful Cowboys and Aliens. Watching Craig struggle with an accent is
almost torturous. But here he uses his English accent and does a great
job. Christopher Plummer as Henrik continues to play characters with
such ease and conviction. No wonder he&#x27;s getting plaudits and
nominations for his role in The Beginners. A wonderful actor who
continues show how it&#x27;s done. Stellan Skarsgard who plays Martin, plays
his role with a deceptive menace and puts in an impressive performance. <br /><br />Others, Robin Wright, Steven Berkoff, Joely Richardson and others,
perform wonderfully. Now, Rooney Mara. There&#x27;s no point comparing,
because Noomi Rapace&#x27;s Lisbeth was electric on the screen. Couldn&#x27;t
take your eyes off her. She had attitude, sex appeal and brains. A
great fictional character, who eventually becomes the feisty
protagonist we all know an love.<br /><br />Rooney Mara is all that and more. She is Lisbeth Salander. Just
mesmerizing on screen, by no means a copycat or an imitation. It&#x27;s a
simply brilliant performance. Say what you want about Noomi Rapace.
Rooney Mara is just phenomenal as Lisbeth. It&#x27;s a performance you&#x27;ll
talk about for days and rightly so she&#x27;s been recognized with
nominations. If a Foreign Press Association know what&#x27;s good, she&#x27;ll
get the Golden Globe award. Yeah yeah there are other performances to
consider, but I rooting for Rooney. Shame her sisters not as good,
pretty girl though. Anyway, Fincher mark is all over this. Obviously
because it&#x27;s his film. But I consider this his darkest film since
Se7en. It&#x27;s sub dark. Recreating the infamous rape scene, which is a
terrifying scene but still watchable, as is Lisbeth&#x27;s revenge against
her rapist.<br /><br />The tone of the film does change, but never hinders the consistency of
the plot and story. Both of which are faithful to the Swedish original.
I also liked the intro. Stylish and sexy techno music with a with great
visuals. Quite a few humorous moments and quite a few sex scenes in
this. Neither of which stopped me from loving a well written,
brilliantly adapted, visually wonderfully thriller. Best Director,
Actress, Screenplay and Cinematography nominations will follow. One of
the films of the year. Anyway, Fincher mark is all over this. Obviously
