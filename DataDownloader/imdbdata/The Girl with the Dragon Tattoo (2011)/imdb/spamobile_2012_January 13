Having seen all the Swedish movies of the series I was a bit
apprehensible on seeing this as I really really like the Swedish ones.
I was not disappointed! What a good well made movie! At least it&#x27;s not
Hollywoodised, it&#x27;s a proper movie of a believable story with good
actors that are very much the person portrayed. It&#x27;s set in stunning
landscapes, in real snow, in real towns, just very real. That all adds
up to being in the movie if you watch it, you&#x27;re there, in it. Praise
to the main characters, well played by both. It&#x27;s very worth while
watching, can&#x27;t wait till the 2 follow up movies are made to, and maybe
the 4th unfinished one as well. Watch it !
