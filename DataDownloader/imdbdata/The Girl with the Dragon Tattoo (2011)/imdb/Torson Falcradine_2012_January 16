There is only one word for this movie and it is brilliant - no, utterly
brilliant.<br /><br />Loved the story ,location , acting, filmography and could not find
fault Loved Rooney Mara too.<br /><br />Daniel Craig surpassed himself and was so much better than his role as
Bond.<br /><br />Scandinavia is wonderful to see and is definitely the future trend for
movie goers.<br /><br />The brutal scenes are brutal but the film would not be the film without
them.
