From the very Bondesque intro onwards I felt a sinking feeling...<br /><br />Simply put, Fincher has tried to Hollywoodise a classic film and failed
really quite horribly. Hate to think he&#x27;ll be doing the other two a
similar disservice.<br /><br />I&#x27;ve read various reviews from Empire to magazines - who is paying them
to give this 4 stars out of five? The plot is spoon fed so you know
what&#x27;s going to happen from a very early stage of the film, and who the
main protagonist is. It&#x27;s so blatant it&#x27;s incredible the script got
past the final draft.<br /><br />Full of plot holes, the acting is lacklustre and the cinematography
that people have been talking of is over rated I think.<br /><br />It was really very predictable that this would be the outcome - I&#x27;m a
massive fan of Fight Club and Se7en but Fincher didn&#x27;t cut the mustard
with this.<br /><br />It&#x27;s clearly been done for a North American market - OK fair enough -
but when the original is so much better to remake it barely a year
after its original release is madness.<br /><br />Daniel Craig doesn&#x27;t even attempt a Swedish accent making him seem
totally out of place. The Salander character is made too confident and
in the end it was hard to really care for her because there was no
background information.<br /><br />A seriously disappointing but expected Hollywood mutilation of a far
better film by Niels Oplev.
