The movie was simply annoying. I wanted to skip forward so badly, but i
didn&#x27;t and now regret it. You people can talk your philosophical crap
about how amazing were the actors, sound or whatever you&#x27;re talking
about, but it is what it is. The first 90 minutes are awful and boring
as hell. The only interesting scenes were the rape, the blowjob scene
and the blackmailing one and i say interesting only cause actually
something was happening (the people on screen were moving and others
even running!!!). And for God&#x27;s sake stop being fanboys. I don&#x27;t care
what book or comic this movie came from or if it&#x27;s a Swedish or
Romanian remake, trilogy or else. The fact of the matter is that this
movie is boring. The only good thing was Daniel Craig and the acting
and if you like a boringly annoying plot and good acting, well....this
movie is for you and you will enjoy it. I&#x27;ve waited 2 hours while
watching this movie, just to see a boring TV show &#x22;twist&#x22; at the end,
something like CSI or else.
