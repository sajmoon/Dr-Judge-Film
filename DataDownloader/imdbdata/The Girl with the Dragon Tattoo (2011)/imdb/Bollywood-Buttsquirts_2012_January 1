How could anyone give these people money to make a film ? What a poor
excuse for a bunch of morons to waste some footage. This is really
rock-bottom movie-making, amateurish, trashy and offensive, degrading
in the way it treats women, really ugly in the worst sense, without any
redeeming features. Compared to this, Saw 3D is a masterpiece among
horror movies. This has just a sorry excuse for a plot, no direction,
no actors trying to act, it&#x27;s just total rubbish. Seeing this is really
such a painful experience I even shiver at remembering it... It seems
unexplainable to me that any producer would hand over some cash to a
bunch of idiots like this in order to have them put together such an
awful mess. Avoid it and you&#x27;ll thank yourself for it.
