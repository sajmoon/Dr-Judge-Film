One of the biggest things with this remake, was if Mara could play this
role made iconic by Noomi Rapace. You&#x27;ll have to answer that one for
yourself, if you&#x27;re even willing to watch both versions. If you ask me,
it was tough watching Mara at first, because she went in a completely
different direction with it, than Noomi did. But as the movie
progressed, I started digging what she was doing with the character. It
still would be tough to name a &#x22;winner&#x22;, I&#x27;d say I like both women and
both characters they showed on screen.<br /><br />Overall and after watching the original Swedish movie again, in the
longer TV cut this time, I have to admit, I think Fincher improved on
the Swedish film. Of course you can always try to argue with his
choices (like why not change location, why let the main actors talk
English most of the time and other things), but that wouldn&#x27;t be a good
way to spend your time. It&#x27;s better to watch it and enjoy his version
of the movie (though &#x22;enjoy&#x22; might stretch it at times, because the
movie does not pull any punches!).<br /><br />Having said that, I&#x27;m curious why there is no connection to the
original movie showing up here on IMDb. Is it that obvious that no one
thought of putting it in the details? I&#x27;m not sure what happened there,
though I&#x27;m sure someone will change it (it&#x27;s almost April 2012, let&#x27;s
see how long it&#x27;ll take).<br /><br />Comparing the two adaptations of the novel (which I haven&#x27;t read), I
can tell you that there are differences. Smaller ones (plot points and
other things), but also time framing and character points. I can only
recommend this, because it is a great thriller indeed!
