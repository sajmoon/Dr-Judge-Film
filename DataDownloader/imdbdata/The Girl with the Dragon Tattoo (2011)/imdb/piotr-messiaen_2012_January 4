Could we stop these endless debates about remakes? This latest version
is not a remake, it is another interpretation of a book. Any work of
art (high or low) can be re-interpreted, and there is no reason why a
talented director like Fincher shouldn&#x27;t present us with his version.
(We don&#x27;t whine about new interpretations of Shakespeare.) There are
two criteria for evaluating whether a remake is justified: financial
and artistic. I doubt the producers will be disappointed if it isn&#x27;t a
blockbuster - they could have avoided the R classification - and
artistically, it seems perfectly valid: the direction, cinematography,
soundtrack are superior, and the performances are at least as good as
the original.<br /><br />Again, it is pointless to try do compare Rapace and Mara: each offers a
powerful perspective on the character. Craig, has been rightly praised,
but for those who felt him subdued or &#x27;blown away&#x27; by Mara - please
recognise that acting is an ensemble activity - he has been praised by
Mara for his generosity - and his role was not only that of a somewhat
insecure journalist, on the skids, but also a complementary foil to
Mara&#x27;s. The role and the interests of the film required him to tone
down the charisma and &#x27;act&#x27;.<br /><br />All in all, an invigorating and stimulating new take on the book.
