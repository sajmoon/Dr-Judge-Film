I had just watched the trilogy with the English translation subtitles
last weekend, then I rented this on Zune yesterday and I think I may
watch it again tonight! I don&#x27;t know what it is about this movie, but
it just captivates me and draws me in deep. There definitely is a lot
of depth to this movie. It is odd in that just about every movie you
watch at some point something happens and it snaps you out of the
trance and makes you realize you are just watching a movie. From start
to finish this movie has you there, deeply involved in the events. <br /><br />- Cinematography is incredible- even thought much of it is focused on
the bland harsh conditions of the Swedish winter it still was just very
visually appealing.<br /><br />- Characters/two movie versions even though I had just watched the
original version I enjoyed both of them immensely. I thought I&#x27;d find
myself really siding with one of the movies or the other and basically
considering one rubbish and one great but I think they both are so well
done that you can easily take away a good deal of enjoyment out of both
of them.<br /><br />- Specific characters. It was extremely interesting to me to see what
must be a tough character to play done apparently so effortlessly and
done so well by both.<br /><br />- Story line there is a rather large difference in the overall story
line for both of the versions I don&#x27;t go in to detail obviously but I
enjoyed both versions.<br /><br />I guess I am probably not the type of typical person who would enjoy
these movies. I am guessing I am not the typical demographic but I
really do think both movie both sets of actors did an incredible job. I
can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t choose one over the other.<br /><br />I think only 2 types of people would not enjoy this- 1 is the type who
just isn&#x27;t in to dark movies with some really horrific scenes and the
other group are those kinds of people that insist the movie must be
exactly like the book (I haven&#x27;t read it).<br /><br />Overall, I loved it and this has become one of my favorite all time
movies. Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara you both really did an incredible
job. I really hope you guys do the trilogy!
