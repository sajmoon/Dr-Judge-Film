I have always read reviews and not taken the time to actually write my
own, but for this film Ill make the exception.<br /><br />For a fan of the books, I have seen the first Swedish film and now
living in Sweden, working where it was filmed in Uppsala. I had a huge
interest on how this film would reflect the book and more importantly
Sweden.<br /><br />Without giving too much away, I think this film has done an excellent
job, I have abstained from giving a full 10 due to the slight change to
the ending.<br /><br />For me, the level of detail, subtleties of how we eat Sandwiches with
cheese on the single slice of bread, the Swedish response when Mikael
couldn&#x27;t get a signal on his phone and much more. I loved this film and
has truly put Sweden back on the map, its not all ABBA you know.<br /><br />Rooney Mara in my opinion played Lisbeth better than Noomi as I thought
Noomi Rapace was too old. The Swedish film didn&#x27;t really mention the
Wennerstr&#xF6;m affair and the money, which is a major platform for the
next 2 books.<br /><br />For a solid cast, great setting, I highly recommend this film.
