&#xA8;You will be investigating thieves, misers, bullies. The most
detestable collection of people that you will ever meet - my family.&#xA8;
The American version of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo has finally
arrived and it was as good as I expected it to be considering David
Fincher was at the helm of the project. Fincher has made some excellent
movies and this one will rank among my favorites along with Seven,
Zodiac, The Social Network and Fight Club. I really wasn&#x27;t a big fan of
having this movie remade since I considered the Swedish version was
great, but when I heard Fincher was going to direct it, I didn&#x27;t doubt
going to see it. I was hooked from the beginning although I expected
this movie was probably not going to be as dark as the original. I was
surprised this Hollywood production actually went to those dark places
the original one did and that the Lisbeth Salander character was played
so well by Rooney Mara. The best thing about the Swedish version was
Noomi Rapace&#x27;s performance as the girl with the dragon tattoo, but in
this film Rooney Mara really performs at the same level and reaches
that same intensity bringing to life once again one of the most
memorable female roles I&#x27;ve seen. The movie is not easy to watch, it
has some dark and raw scenes, but the story is so well written and
Fincher&#x27;s direction is just brilliant that it makes the film worth
seeing all over again despite haven seen the original films or read the
Millennium novels by Larsson. Despite knowing what was going to happen
I really enjoyed the performances, the scenery, and the sound editing
of this film. It might not be better than the Swedish film, but it does
live up to it and perhaps now a broader American audience will actually
become familiar with this bestselling novel. I still recommend the
three original Swedish versions as well.<br /><br />Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is a journalist who works for
Millennium magazine in Sweden and has recently been sued by a business
tycoon named Hans-Erik Wennerstrom (Ulf Friberg) for libel against him.
The truth is that Blomkvist has been framed and the proof he had
against Wennerstrom was false so he loses a lot of money in the
lawsuit. It&#x27;s during this time that he receives a job proposition from
Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), a former CEO of the Vanger group,
who lives in an isolated island along with the rest of the members of
the wealthy family. Henrik has hired Mikael because he wants him to
investigate what happened to his disappeared niece, Harriet, who he
believes has been murdered by someone in his family forty years ago,
although police officers haven&#x27;t been able to find any clues over the
years. The reason Henrik hasn&#x27;t given up looking for the killer is that
every year on his birthday he receives a portrait with a flower as a
gift from different parts of the world that he presumes is from the
killer. He says that the killer has to be someone from the family
because there was an accident on the bridge the day Harriet disappeared
and no one could get in or out of the island on that day so it couldn&#x27;t
be an outsider. Henrik&#x27;s brothers were all Nazi sympathizers during the
War and he suspects any of them could be the killer. Lisbeth Salander
(Rooney Mara) is a computer hacker who is pretty good at what she does,
but is a very troublesome teenager who has very poor social skills. She
dresses like a punk, has several piercings, and a dragon tattoo on her
back. She was hired by Henrik to follow Mikael during the trial and
make sure he was clean. When Mikael asks for an investigator to help
him solve the mystery, they recommend her to him and they begin working
together forming an unlikely alliance. They soon discover however that
digging up the past could bring them trouble.<br /><br />The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo has several good things going for it
beginning with the excellent story written by Larson. It has a lot of
suspense and thrills, it works better than most mystery films. Zaillian
really does a great job with the adaptation of the novel. The second
thing it has going for it are excellent characters and good actors
playing them. Rooney Mara, Daniel Craig, Christopher Plummer and
Stellan Skarsgard are all excellent in this film and they have rich and
memorable characters to interpret. Lisbeth Salander has to be one of
the best female characters I&#x27;ve seen in an action film in a long time.
Her side story is a nice compliment to the murder investigation, and in
the next two sequels the film shifts its focus mainly back to her. I
still think this first novel is better than the next two so I don&#x27;t
expect the next movies to be as good as this one (at least that&#x27;s how
they played out in the Swedish films). The cinematography in this film
is also great, setting the dark tone of the film. The film has recently
been nominated for 5 Oscars including Best Cinematography and a Best
Actress nod for Rooney Mara. I think it got snubbed for a Best Picture
nomination (it was better than some of the movies nominated). This
isn&#x27;t a movie for everyone: it is dark, it has some strong scenes (a
difficult to watch rape scene), but it is a well made thriller and
among the best films of the year.<br /><br />http://estebueno10.blogspot.com
