First of all I have to say that I didn&#x27;t read the book or saw the other
films. To me this was a first hand experience into a story I tried not
to read about. This movie is an old fashion thriller. The story is
really good and really dark but most of all, intense. With the prices
of tickets getting higher and quality of films getting lower this one
breaks the rule.<br /><br />I advise people to go watch this. It tells an very good and gripping
story. The acting is amazing, especially Rooney Mara (Lisbeth), however
everyone does an awesome job. <br /><br />We all know there are three books and we assume that they will be doing
a second and a third movie and I can&#x27;t wait.
