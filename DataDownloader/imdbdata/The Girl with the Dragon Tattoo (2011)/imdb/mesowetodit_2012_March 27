This is my first review, as it is my first complete going over of the
three items related to this story; The book, the Swedish film and the
American film, and in that order of consumption. The book was
absolutely a blast to read. Highly recommended to read the book, skip
either of the movies, unless you are curious to put the face to the
characters like me. Great intrigue, details, character development,
etc. <br /><br />The Swedish film was dry, perhaps the subtitles? The actors did not
portray the characters as well as the American actors. For the American
version, I felt as if it was incomplete altogether. The film left
out/skipped a lot of details, although it was not important for the
over all story, I felt the parts skipped was important for background
and character development. If you did not read the book, one would find
it strange why Lisbeth can warm up to Mikael so quickly. There were
many parts like this that would confuse a person who did not read the
book, and leaving little room for a movie viewer to feel any emotions
towards the character. Mikael and Lisbeth were my favorite characters
in the book, but I did not get the same reactions from either movie.
They were just empty vessels carrying the story along. <br /><br />Perhaps there were too many details and it would make the movie too
long...unfortunately I do not see a directors cut in the release, so
its clear to say for movie goers, this is pretty much it. As for the
actors, the most impressive of them all was Rooney Mara. She portrayed
Lisbeth much closer to the book character than the Swedish film&#x27;s
actor, Noomi Rapace. Rooney was pale, skinny, dark, sad. Daniel Craig
and Michael Nyqvist(Swedish) was just plain old boring, with Nyqvist a
bit more emotions displayed, where as Craig&#x27;s acting was the same old
007 look throughout the entire movie. The other two American actors
that made great contributions to this version was Christopher Plummer,
splendid as always in his role, and Stellen Skarsgard, whom always fit
the villain part deliciously.<br /><br />Each important part of the movie was well done in both movies. The
information necessary for the viewer to understand how the resolution
of the mystery came about was filmed well. However, the ending of the
American version did NOT follow the book, for which I was a bit
disappointed. Steven Zaillian, screenwriter for this movie felt: &#x22; &#x22;I
wasn&#x27;t trying to do something different or trying to fix something,&#x22;
says Zaillian. &#x22;I just thought it was a good idea. when I read the
book, I thought, &#x27;Why are we going so far afield for this mystery to be
resolved? Might it be a little more interesting if it&#x27;s solved a little
closer to home?&#x27; That&#x27;s all there was to it. I kind of felt it was
right for the character.&#x22;<br /><br />(from: http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/12/25/dragon-tattoo-movie-

continue with the filming of the next two books. Personally I thought
it was rather important how the booked ended it. The Swedish version&#x27;s
ending kept with the book. Thanks for reading, hope this helps.
