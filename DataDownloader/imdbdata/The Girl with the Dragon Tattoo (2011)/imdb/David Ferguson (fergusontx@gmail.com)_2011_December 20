Greetings again from the darkness. The character of Lisbeth Salander
absolutely fascinates me. That&#x27;s true whether we are discussing Stieg
Larsson&#x27;s Millennium trilogy novels, the Swedish film versions, or this
latest film version from director David Fincher and a screenplay from
Steve Zaillian. It&#x27;s also true whether Lisbeth is played on screen by
Noomi Rapace (Swedish films) or Rooney Mara. She is a brilliant
character hiding in plain sight from a world that has fiercely
mistreated her, and now misjudges and underestimates her. She is the
oddest heroine I can recall ... and I can&#x27;t get enough of her.<br /><br />Let&#x27;s start with the source material. Stieg Larsson&#x27;s books are far
from perfect, but addictive just the same. The first book (on which
this film is based) is, at its core, a simple who-dunnit presented in a
manner that is claustrophobic, paranoid and eerie. Moving on to this
particular film, we find the director and screenplay holding the basic
tone while making a few changes ... some minor, others more
substantial. These changes may irk those fans who are a bit more loyal
to the books, but Fincher surely wanted to offer more than a simple
re-telling of the story.<br /><br />Daniel Craig plays Mikael Blomkvist, the journalist hired to solve the
40 year old mystery of the disappearance/murder of Harriet Vanger,
niece to Swedish millionaire Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer). To
research, Blomkvist must dig into the Vanger&#x27;s rotten family tree of
Nazis, anti-Semites, sexual predators, anti-social fanatics, and a few
just plain loony birds. You can imagine how excited this rich and once
powerful family is to have someone uncovering long buried secrets.
Circumstances allow for Lisbeth to assist Blomkvist in researching
this.<br /><br />Unlike many mysteries where assembling the clues is the most fun, the
real heart of this story is the odd, somewhat uncomfortable developing
relationship between Blomkvist and Lisbeth. This latest version allows
this to develop relatively smoothly, but it nonetheless rattles our
senses. We see the subtle changes in Lisbeth as she slowly opens up to
the idea of a real friendship based on trust. Fear not mystery fans,
the Vanger clan still provides more than enough juice to keep any film
sleuth happy.<br /><br />It&#x27;s truly impossible to avoid comparisons between the two movie
versions and the respective casts. It&#x27;s quite obvious Mr. Fincher was
working with a substantially greater budget than Niels Arden Opler had
for the first Swedish film. While they are both enthralling, I actually
lean a bit towards the rawer original. That takes nothing away from
this latest version. Same with Noomi Rapace vs. Rooney Mara. Ms. Mara
is excellent in her performance and I was fully satisfied, but Ms.
Rapace brought a rougher edge to the role ... one that made it even
tougher to crack that shell. The biggest difference in the casts is
Daniel Craig against Michael Nyqvist. Mr. Craig is just a bit too cool
for the role, while Nyqvist captured the insecurity and vulnerability
that Larsson wrote about.<br /><br />All of that is nit-picking. Both film versions are sterling
entertainment and hopefully the Fincher version will bring the story to
a much wider audience. I would encourage those that are interested to
check out the Swedish version, as well as the Larsson books. Maybe that
will explain my fascination with this creature known as Lisbeth
Salander.
