...or you&#x27;ll get lost as to what is being investigated in such great
detail in a 40 year old missing?/murdered? person who done it case.<br /><br />Didn&#x27;t read the books but it did remind me of a really good Agatha
Christie novel I used to read back in the late &#x27;70&#x27;s in high school
except without the sadistic torture and provocative sex scenes.<br /><br />You&#x27;ll appreciate the dark, cold and cozy ambiance of the entire movie
that gets you to want to curl up in a warm bed with a hot toddy to read
the very great mystery novel you&#x27;re now watching as the movie unfolds
to get you to focus on every character&#x27;s quirky behaviors as a means of
finding out who done it. <br /><br />Pay attention to the sidetrack hacking shenanigans presented as a
clever way of getting back at someone through their bank account. Pay
attention! It&#x27;s really cool how it&#x27;s done!<br /><br />This movie also has that sophisticated European foreign film feel
that&#x27;s so unlike the pacing of American movies. I kept asking is this
what it&#x27;s like in Sweden? Geez! Their welfare system really sucks as
well. You&#x27;ll see what I mean.<br /><br />This movie DOES take you to an alternate unsettling world of daily
dysfunctional and abusive family life in another country with a history
dealing with its own serial killer who&#x27;s never been found for 40 years.<br /><br />I&#x27;ld have to say without a doubt Rooney Mara&#x27;s performance is on line
with Batman&#x27;s Heath Ledger&#x27;s &#x22;Joker&#x22; in the way they completely and
totally become another person never seen before but is made to look
quite real and unsettling. They both out do Brando and Dean in this
respect. It&#x27;s fascinating to watch an actor go that deep into a
character with such realism. Don&#x27;t know how they do it. <br /><br />Just watching that is worth the price of a movie ticket on top of the
surprise ending to the who done it mystery.
