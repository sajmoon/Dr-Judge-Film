Loved the movie, and I have read all three books and seen the Swedish
versions. As one reviewer already mentioned, I wanted to clear
something up: this is not a remake, but an adaptation of the book.
People take away different thing from the book, hence why the movies
have slight differences. Its fine to like one over the other, but
reasons shouldn&#x27;t be &#x27;it&#x27;s an American remake.&#x27; Both films took away
different parts of the book, which on both films, can be disappointing.
However, the book is written so in depth that some cuts had to be made.
People cannot compare or say how Lisbeth is portrayed between the films
without knowing her character in the book. Side note, I could have done
without the beginning. A little too stylized for me. However, the
performances were brilliant. And the score was great. This movie makes
me want to watch seven again.
