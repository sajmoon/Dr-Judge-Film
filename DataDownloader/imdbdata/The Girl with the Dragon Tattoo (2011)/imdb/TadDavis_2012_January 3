Isn&#x27;t it nice that you don&#x27;t actually have to choose which version is
&#x22;better&#x22;? They&#x27;re both outstanding. They&#x27;re different. They have
different strengths. The Swedish version does a better job showing
Salander&#x27;s background; the American version does a better job showing
the relationship between Salander and Blomqvist. The Swedish version
does a better job handling the Wennerstrom subplot; the American
version does a better job handling several aspects of the central
Harriet Vanger mystery. <br /><br />As far as the ending is concerned, neither version follows the book
completely; the book&#x27;s ending is a kind of composite of the two. Or,
more accurately, the two directors chose to emphasize different aspects
of the book&#x27;s ending.<br /><br />Take my advice. Don&#x27;t choose between them and don&#x27;t waste time arguing
which is better. Appreciate the strengths of each. And while you&#x27;re at
it, read the novel AND listen to the excellent audiobook version
narrated by Simon Vance.<br /><br />And keep all the versions away from your kids.
