This movie -most certainly- should be a joy to watch for those who read
the book. But for those who didn&#x27;t, it does a poor job of reaching out
to the viewer and making them feel the atmosphere of the story.<br /><br />The book was covered good enough, the plotting was satisfactory but it
certainly didn&#x27;t drag me, as the story evolved and came to an end.<br /><br />The ending was poorly covered and it felt like skipping tens of pages
of a book and reading the end pages. The story told on the screen, went
too fast, just as the director was trying to squeeze a tale of hours
into just 2.<br /><br />Acting was definitely good. Everything-cinema was very good, except the
story telling.<br /><br />Overall, it was nice entertainment. But it doesn&#x27;t live up to the buzz
created.
