2011_December 26 
I went to see this film today and just knew that I was going to be
disappointed. I&#x27;ve seen the original at least five times...in both
languages. To my delight and surprise each film is better than the
other. Where one version lags the other takes over...they should be
seen as companion pieces.<br /><br />The acting is superb in every character! The scripting has some new
twists and turns.<br /><br />When the academy awards take place this 2012:<br /><br />Best Picture<br /><br />Best Actress<br /><br />Best Soundtrack (I didn&#x27;t hear a note, that means that I was had)
