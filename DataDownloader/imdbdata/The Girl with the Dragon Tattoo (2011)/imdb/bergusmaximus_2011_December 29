I loved the story line. Very interesting plot. But there were more than
one vulgar rape scenes that were completely unnecessary. It could have
eluded to the fact but instead, showed lots of disgusting details. I am
a fan of the director. I loved Se7en and Fight Club is my all time
favorite movie. I don&#x27;t usually get offended when I see violence or
sex, but this was horrific! I hope no one brings a child or teen to see
this. Seriously, the movie would be a 9 or 10 if they had skipped over
the 10 minute scenes of torturing rape!!!! Daniel Craig was awesome.
The movie was long but I was very interested in his case he was working
on, lots to think about, a who done it. I like Mikael and Lisbeth
together, I thought they worked well together.
