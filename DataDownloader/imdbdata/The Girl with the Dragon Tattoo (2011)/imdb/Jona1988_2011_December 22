I have read all three of Stieg Larsson&#x27;s books and seen the Swedish
movies. The Swedish version of The girl with the dragon tattoo(M&#xE4;n som
hatar kvinnor) was very good but it is somewhat overrated. Not bad in
really any way but still not as good as some claim, which has clearly
been shown by comments about this new version. When word came about
that David Fincher would direct the new one I was just overwhelmed.
Maybe cause it was my maybe favourite director working right now
filming one of the best books I had read in years. With thrillers like
Se7en and Zodiac to his credit he was the perfect choice. And if one
asks me he doesn&#x27;t disappoint with this one either.<br /><br />The big question for many have been will Rooney Mara live up to Noomi
Rapace as Lisbeth Salander? The answer is She does! Who is better is
difficult to say because they actually play the character quite
different. Noomi is older and seems more secure while Mara feels more
fragile and emotional. I feel Mara is more like how Lisbeth is
described in the book. Since I like this movie better I feel stronger
for her but Rapace is also great. It&#x27;s a draw. Daniel Craig is great as
Blomkvist, and it&#x27;s good that even if he is a big star(James Bond) he
plays the role really down to earth, kind of this simple person the
character should be. It is and should be Salander who is the main one
and he lets Mara be the star. One actor who really surpasses his
predecessor is Stellan Skarsg&#xE5;rd. Considering his character has such a
big role this is a big plus for the American version. Christopher
Plummer should also be mentioned as one who really creates the
substance in the movie. As I&#x27;m now on the actors I should also mention
the relation between Salander and Blomkvist. Craig and Mara are
brilliant at creating chemistry. Not only does one focus on the mystery
but at the end maybe even more about them. Do they really speak with a
Swedish accent? Some of them yes and I admit it felt a bit strange a
first but one gets used to it like with most other things so some time
later in the movie I didn&#x27;t mind anymore. <br /><br />Steven Zaillian deserves praise for the script. The original movie,
even though it was not much shorter the plot felt extremely rushed.
Especially the ending were it went so quick and simple it just felt
like it made no sense. Zaillian succeeds in fitting the story without
making it to fast or simple. Even if one hasn&#x27;t read the book you can
follow what is going on. Very impressive and perhaps what lifted this
movie so high above the Swedish. So like Fincher said there are some
changes but for me, unlike how some feel about adaptations, the book
isn&#x27;t something holy and changes don&#x27;t have to be wrong. Stieg
Larsson&#x27;s novel was not without flaws and the changes they made are
actually for the better, it feels more believable. Fincher is a master
of suspense and shows it again here. The atmosphere and tone of the
settings fit the story perfect. The movie is brutal just like the book
and also that is handled great. Neither reduced or overdone. <br /><br />The music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is as expected amazing.
Almost as great as for The Social Network. I loved the opening credits
set to the tones of the Immigrant Song cover. Some may feel it&#x27;s a bit
out of place but personally I loved it. <br /><br />So are there any weak points in it? Well the last parts of the movie
the story slows down somewhat but thats because Stieg Larsson&#x27;s novel
was like that and those parts are also needed for the continuing of the
series. And even if I really like the Millennium trilogy, the story is
not perfect not as complicated as some might expect. Doesn&#x27;t mess with
your head like Se7en. <br /><br />If I&#x27;m to rank David Fincher&#x27;s detective thrillers The girl with the
dragon tattoo is below Se7en and Zodiac but it doesn&#x27;t mean it is a
weak movie, definitely not! I don&#x27;t think I can find much they could
have done better. The Swedish movie was good but this is much better.
It lives up to my expectations as a fan of the book. Also works great
as a thriller on it&#x27;s own.
