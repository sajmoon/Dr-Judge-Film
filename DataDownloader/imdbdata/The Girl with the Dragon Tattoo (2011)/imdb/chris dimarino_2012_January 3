The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was a hit that fired on all cylinders.
It has deep and interesting characters and a great, thorough story. The
movie is very mature and can not be watched lightly, it requires full
attention and will shake you will disturbia at time. However, this all
attributes to the mood which is set beautifully with imagery and a
great musical score. I think that Daniel Craig did a great job in a
more vulnerable and educated role and Rooney Mara does a great job
making us marvel and fear her character. All of the secondary
characters in the movie add to an extremely complete and thought out
executed movie. Overall, it is a mature movie that should be enjoyed by
all, of the sufficient age.
