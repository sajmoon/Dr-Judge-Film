Though you might have read synopses, I&#x27;ll give it in brief: the movie,
like the book, is set in Sweden where a disgraced reporter, Mikael
Blomvist (Daniel Craig) is hired by a wealthy family to investigate an
unsolved murder in their history, and is then teamed with the
investigator who shamed him, an eccentric, antisocial young woman
Lisabeth Salander (Rooney Mara) .<br /><br />I have to hand it to director David Fincher. Though not overly
suspenseful, the movie also isn&#x27;t boring, and the plot is never
confusing, though it&#x27;s complex with a lot of characters. This is no
small accomplishment for Fincher because it&#x27;s also bloated with many
unnecessary scenes. It could have lost close to an hour&#x27;s worth without
losing anything on plot or characters.<br /><br />The story starts with a parallel structure, Mikael&#x27;s being one,
Lisabeth being the other, then they converge. At least four scenes at
the beginning seem to serve only as back story for a rape, which means
that scene can accurately be called gratuitous, and not from being
graphic, which it is. They could have easily dropped it and instead
started with the next encounter between those characters, which told
you everything you needed to know about Lisabeth and what previously
transpired. Mikael&#x27;s side of the plot similarly belonged in the back
story that should have been started later.<br /><br />Then at the end, the movie continues for another twenty minutes after
the story is over. The whole point of this seemed to be to set it up
for the sequels, but it was so rushed. They could have made a whole
sequel based on those scenes alone. Abbreviated like that, it&#x27;s pretty
unsatisfying, especially to an audience waiting to leave.<br /><br />Despite the title, Mikael is in so many of the opening scenes where the
story takes shape it&#x27;s easy to think he&#x27;s the protagonist, whereas
Lisabeth is. The title should have tipped me off, but I knew nothing
about the story coming in, and didn&#x27;t know if The Girl would be the
murder victim, MacGuffin, the protagonist, the antagonist, or part of
the set decoration.<br /><br />A lot of the other things in the movie were very standard. I not only
called the final plot twist twenty minutes into it, but I called it as
the least satisfying conclusion that wasn&#x27;t downright dumb.<br /><br />Also, and this is not a spoiler as much as a general observation that
every movie-goer knows: when a family has Nazis in it, it does narrow
down the list of suspects considerably. I was hoping this part of the
film would be a tease, or background. I know Nazis were 20 million
lives worth of evil, but the Hitler mustache has also been out of style
for close to seventy years. Surely there are more modern brands of evil
writers can think of. Like even Neo-Nazis? Though that does require a
movie to be original, relevant, topical and clever, things Hollywood
definitely won&#x27;t go near.<br /><br />Making Lisabeth a neo-punk with her tattoo doesn&#x27;t ring true for a
Asperger&#x27;s savant and social outcast to me. Not in an age where seventy
percent of people under thirty have tattoos and piercings, but it&#x27;s
Hollywood&#x27;s perception of what an outcast looks like. A much more
accurate, if comical, portrayal of an outcast was, ironically, in
Fincher&#x27;s earlier movie, &#x22;Fight Club&#x22;: Helena Bonham Carter as Marla
Singer.<br /><br />The whole cast is good. The only one that looked questionable is the
rapist, but that&#x27;s because he&#x27;s stereotype only in retrospect. Rooney
Mara has received a Golden Globe nomination for her portrayal. Problem
is, for most the movie, she isn&#x27;t supposed to show any emotion. I&#x27;d
have to watch a few scenes again, but I&#x27;ll say I&#x27;m not sure it was that
good unless GG were grading on a curve. She did well at the parts she
was required to show range, but, for me, she also didn&#x27;t steal any
scenes.<br /><br />Hollywood, and apparently the book&#x27;s author, have a very exaggerated
picture of what hackers can do. At one point Lisabeth sneers at
Mikael&#x27;s encryption like it was no problem to crack. And I thought, as
the Lisabeth said, &#x22;Oh, plu-ease!&#x22; The reality: even with inexpensive
encryption programs, it&#x27;s not possible cracking it was easy unless he
had a weak pass-phrase. Otherwise, does she carry a pocket quantum
computer? <br /><br />Finally, just how much money did the tobacco industry plow into this
movie? I know it sounds like an unfair criticism or pet peeve, but it
isn&#x27;t. It effects the way the film is handled. An opening scene goes
out of its way to show a character buying cigarettes and asking for a
brand name (not a fictional one, as movies usually do). I wouldn&#x27;t
object, except the scene had no other point. From then on, characters,
especially the protagonists smoked in about 75% of the scenes, and
Fincher starts at least two scenes, not with dialog, but with a
character lighting up. At the end, Mikael says he has quit (just like
that, because anybody can quit smoking just like that at any time). I
know realistically, people smoke, but this was something other than
adding realism, and it was very distracting. It&#x27;s a fair question to
ask whether sponsorship and product placement weakens this film,
tobacco being a bit more insidious than most.<br /><br />Fincher did much the same thing in &#x22;Fight Club.&#x22; But if it were paid
for there, and it likely was, it did fit. The characters were hardly
heroic, and it added just enough realism without making me too
suspicious that the movie was made as a cigarette commercial.<br /><br />This all being said, I did enjoy the movie enough, though I&#x27;m not going
to recall it frequently my whole life. It&#x27;s competent, but nothing
great or original. It&#x27;s standard, and not stupid. However, it is far
too long, and you should bring your nicotine patch.
