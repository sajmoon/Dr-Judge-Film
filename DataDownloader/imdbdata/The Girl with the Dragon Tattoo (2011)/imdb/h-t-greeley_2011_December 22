&#x22;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#x22; is poised as an enigmatic
mystery-thriller of real cinematic and storytelling potential, with a
superb cast and gripping performances to bet on. Filmgoers used to
David Fincher, with similar titles such as &#x22;Seven&#x22; and &#x22;The Game&#x22; to
his name, are all in a fuss to see what is next in the Fincher oeuvre.
What we know of David Fincher, is that although he&#x27;s created such
classic films, he&#x27;s always done it with a paintbrush not so famously
modest. While we&#x27;ve always appreciated this granular and physical
realism of his films, whether it was the violence in &#x22;Fight Club&#x22;, or
the crime scenes in &#x22;Seven&#x22;, its appreciation was only served by its
storytelling. Out of context, many scenes appear as almost manufactured
gratuity, seemingly made just to shock audiences. Unfortunately what
has happened in the &#x22;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#x22; is just that. The
storytelling, narrative, and dialogue from the onset, follows through
the film in a clumsy, nebulous, and poorly-written mess, making
everything written seem just as bookends to a number of highly shocking
scenes. These scenes, while may be factual to the original story, are
what the director seems to have focused his creativity on. And all that
comes out of it, not mincing words, is purely shocking
rapist-pornography. If I were to write off the film for these scenes,
which I think is enough, it would be too easy. Lisbeth, one of the
central characters, whom is the victim in these disturbing scenes, is
depicted from the onset as an almost completely unsympathetic
character. She&#x27;s introduced as an antisocial, mute, even creepy prodigy
of her investigative craft and leaves the film just as cold as she came
in (The last scene, although narratively intended to be sympathetic,
didn&#x27;t change the character&#x27;s complete lack of pathos) Her emotions,
even though apparently warm for Mikael (Daniel Craig), are not
particularly warming for the audience, as her emotional depth,
personality, and sexuality on screen seems more dark, twisted, and
expressionless as the man who rapes her. The film successfully depicts
her as a &#x22;mute creep&#x22;, and a completely unlikable and unsympathetic
character. While you may hear groundswell rumblings for a best-actress
nomination for Lisbeth by passionate fans of the film, it&#x27;s my impulse
to remind that those usually nominated, and those that win, normally
have one of two things in common: Sympathy or Empathy. Many &#x22;heroes&#x22;
may have Sympathy. And many &#x22;villains&#x22; may have Empathy. We don&#x27;t feel
fellowship or pathos for a &#x22;villain&#x22; (i.e.: Sympathy), but we might
understand their motivations and emotions (i.e.: Empathy), as however
their successfully displayed (i.e.: Macbeth). The tragedy of Lisbeth is
that she&#x27;s depicted as a &#x22;hero&#x22; under the guise and manner of a
particularly mute &#x22;villain&#x22;, with the result being that she lacks
either really any Sympathy or Empathy. The film, luring audiences as a
potentially great and classic Mystery-thriller, with Fincher&#x27;s
exquisite eye and style, is nothing but barely a facade to shock
audiences. <br /><br />I feel personally terrible for all the families and children who could
be going during this Christmas season to see it, under the impression
that whatever R-rated scenes in the film will be negligible for what is
successfully advertised as a possible classic-in-the-making of a very
well-written Mystery. These scenes are X-rated material, I personally
find it hard to believe they&#x27;ve received just an R rating.
