The ultimate contemporary film noir was created as modern information
gathering and communication techniques took us through an evolving
mystery that was filled with interesting characters. <br /><br />The dark story and Gothic style created an edgy moodiness that enhanced
the intrigue and made an exciting experience. The mystery was
multi-layered, well thought out and although a bit horrifically
fantastical was still absorbing. There is a tremendous level of
decadence and perversion in this mystery which had similar overtimes to
the classic Silence of the Lambs. It focuses in on, what I heard was an
alternative title to the novel, violence against women. And one of the
most intense revenge sequences that not only menacingly satisfies but
at the same time smartly adds a level of momentum created one of the
best individual scenes of the past year.<br /><br />Even more than the intriguing mystery, the creation of one of the most
mesmerizing, interesting characters enhanced the experience. A
thrilling character to get to know, the &#x22;Girl&#x22; became the ultimate
strong anti-hero/feminist even more so and more developed than &#x22;the
Bitch&#x22; in Kill Bill and Sigourney Weaver&#x27;s character in the Alien
movies. Richly dark and edgy her Gothic anti-society appearance blended
well with the way she holds herself; angst ridden and moody. Despite
the evilly rebellious exterior she is incredibly technologically savvy,
brilliant, tough, and nearly fearless. She has a fiercely independent
sense of self. The sense of self made her confident and self-actualized
sexually yet adding a layer to this greatness was a level of
vulnerability. Her vulnerability was not only the traumatic kind, but
simply the minor kind which we all have in our lives and can relate to.
The kind where minor imperfection and mishaps occur, the kind where she
can&#x27;t get exactly what she wants, the stuff which we all experience.
This created a relatable individual despite her renegade appearance,
and almost supersonic abilities and therefore she is a character we
feel for and understand. We got to know this soul as she merged with
the intriguing mystery.<br /><br />There was an initial switching back and forth between the mystery and
the character creation. This blended well together so that there was
never a dull moment.<br /><br />The story was a bit horrifically over the top and the abilities, almost
powers of the &#x22;girl&#x22; put the movie on a borderline reality/fantastical
realm. The character&#x27;s strength and sexiness will be hard to forget.
