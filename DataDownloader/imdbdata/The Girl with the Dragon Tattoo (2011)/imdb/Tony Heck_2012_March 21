&#x22;I want you to help me catch a killer of women.&#x22; Disgraced journalist
Mikael Blomqvist (Craig) is asked by a man named Henrik Vanger
(Plummer) to find his nieces killer who committed the crime 40 years
ago. He receives help from the eccentric Lisbeth Salander (Mara) who
has her own motives. I had contradicting feelings going into this one.
I really loved the original (I haven&#x27;t read any of the books though)
but I was worried about how this one would be but was very excited to
see it. I though the casting was perfect but the original Lisbeth was
so tremendous that I couldn&#x27;t see how this could be as good. One of the
first things I noticed was how similar Mara looked to the original
actress. As the movie went on I started seeing more and more
similarities to the original. I realize that this is based off a book
so they will be similar but this to me felt like almost a shot for shot
remake. It&#x27;s been a while since I saw the original but it felt like
almost the exact same thing. All that said though the original seemed
better to me, I don&#x27;t know what this was missing but I don&#x27;t think it
was as good. I did like this movie though. Overall, not as good as
original but very close. I give it a B.
