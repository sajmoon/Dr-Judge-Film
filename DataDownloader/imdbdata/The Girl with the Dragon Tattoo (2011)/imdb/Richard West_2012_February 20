When I read the books I felt compassion for Lisbeth and what she had
endured. The same was true of the Swedish films despite the handicap of
subtitles. Consequently, I was really looking forward to this version,
but somehow the edge had gone.<br /><br />The actors were fine. I am unsure whether the problem was the script or
the production, though I suspect the latter. There there was a gloss on
the film that, for me, deprived it of bite.<br /><br />If you had not seen the earlier version, no doubt viewing this will be
enjoyable, though uncomfortable in places. I shall stay with Noomi
Rapace and company.
