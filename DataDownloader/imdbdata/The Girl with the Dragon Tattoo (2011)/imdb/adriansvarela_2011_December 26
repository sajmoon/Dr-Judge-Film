A true masterpiece.....was starting to lose faith in the American movie
industry...until i saw this tonight leaving the theaters at
1am...completely blown away...so many say the &#x22;swedish&#x22; version is
better....i&#x27;ve never seen that version...and don&#x27;t intend too...i plan
to read the novels...it is a very dark film and showed me everything i
wanted to see. quite beautiful in my eyes really.. the actors were
superb...camera angles...everything...i found no flaw in this
movie...sure..i&#x27;ve only taken a film class in college...but i consider
myself to be of higher movie critique in the average joe community...Go
see it...
