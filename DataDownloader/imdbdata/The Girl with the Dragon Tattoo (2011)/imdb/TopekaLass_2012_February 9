This version of Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (the original released in
2009) adopts its own look and feel. The actors bring different
variations to their roles and didn&#x27;t copy what the original cast had
done. This was no easy task and they pulled it off. <br /><br />The same could be said for David Fincher as the director of this recent
version. He took the original and made it his own. Fincher is really
good at this stuff. He did a great job of giving the look a dark,
cloudy foreboding feeling, thanks to the phenomenal photography of Jeff
Cronenweth.<br /><br />It seemed like he brought in the Zodiac style, and that&#x27;s a good thing.
The music is by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross constant and foreboding
and blend very well with the style and pacing.<br /><br />Daniel Craig, Rooney Mara and the rest of the cast were all well
underplayed. A special nod to actor, Christopher Plummer, who seems to
keep your eyes on him in every scene that he is in.
