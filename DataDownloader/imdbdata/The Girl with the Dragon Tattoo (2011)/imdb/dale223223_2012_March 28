Because if I had then I would have spoiled the remake.<br /><br />Honestly, the original movie was one of the few movies I became too
bored with to finish... no matter how attracted I was to the Lisbeth
character. I just thought the whole affair was somewhat over-rated and
was very skeptical of any remakes.<br /><br />Thankfully David Fincher created a wonderful film in this recreation. I
had loved Fight Club and, to my surprise, was quite enthralled by his
film about an otherwise boring subject matter about a social networking
website. Indeed I was very happy to watch what I wished I had been
watching when I saw the original film. David Fincher adds the much
needed nuance to the film and arranges the components into a wonderful
and dynamic composition that is not boring or predictable. When most
movies would end this one continues for a second and third climax,
without feeling drawn out... it&#x27;s so well crafted.<br /><br />This film has truly made me a David Fincher fan in that it solidifies
in my mind how great of an artist he is as a director.
