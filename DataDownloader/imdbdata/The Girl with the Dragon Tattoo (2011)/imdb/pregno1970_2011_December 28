A bizarre movie to open at Xmas TGWTDT is an overlong adaptation of the
novel. Unfortunately it follows a very successful recent Swedish
adaptation which seems to have satisfied the fanbase.<br /><br />However given that this is a depressing and relentlessly bleak tale
involving graphic non consentual sexual acts I&#x27;m not sure who that
fanbase would be,<br /><br />Fincher is the most overrated director ion the World ( the game and
alien3 are cinematic masterpieces?really??) and I had begun to resent
the fact that this monstrosity has been promoted as a work of genius
for over a year.<br /><br />The movie is painful to watch- but not in a good way. It doesn&#x27;t feel
like a cathartic attempt to relieve a tortured soul, more a pretentious
director throwing in all sorts to live up to his own hype.<br /><br />The cast do their best with Mara towering above everyone else.
Astonishingly this is Daniel Craig&#x27;s fourth big budget flop of 2011 (
and how did this cost so much anyway?) Avoid like the plague.
