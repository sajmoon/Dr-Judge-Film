I thought the story line was very interesting, but the rape scenes were
too disgusting for me! I feel it would have been better with less. I
almost walked out after the rape scene. The mystery was great and the
acting very convincing. I like that the main character was strong and
finally fought back against her rapist, but wished she would have done
so in the second scene. I was just way too uncomfortable watching her
be abused. It did not help that a person next to me brought a young
child who watched it all! Not a child movie which anyone should be able
to figure that out! I would have liked the character more if she was
less easy and did not have sex with everyone in the movie. It seemed
like sex scenes were just put in out of context. I understand that the
sex scene with the woman showed that she had an abusive history with
men and turned to woman, but all the others I felt were a bit much. I
would not watch it again and wish I had not gone to see it.
