I did not read the books nor did I know anything about the movie. And I
was only made aware just recently there is an original Swedish version,
which some people comment that it was better or the American version
was better. I will wait to see all then see the Swedish and make the
determination for myself which is the best.<br /><br />That said, I completely loved it. It goes without saying this movies
isn&#x27;t for the weak minded or those who do not want to be shocked at
what they are seeing. It&#x27;s pretty graphic and inexplicable, but that
made the movie interesting. Yes it was a little long and I didn&#x27;t so
much care for the ending, but those are minor details that did not sway
my opinion about the movie. I suggest you see it and form your own
opinion, keep an open mind!
