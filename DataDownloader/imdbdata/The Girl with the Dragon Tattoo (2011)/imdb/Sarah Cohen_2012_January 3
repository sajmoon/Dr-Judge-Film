Excessively long. Could have been 60 minutes shorter and not lost much
of the story. I liked the lighting, and the costumes/clothing were
right on target. The acting performance of the girl with the dragon
tattoo was good. However, the development of her character and many
other supporting roles were excessively OVER-developed. The carving was
too much and added nothing, as were the 4 or 5 interactions with &#x27;the
pig&#x27;. The film was more focused setting an agenda then telling a a
better story. The technology and budget were there, as was a desire to
include an excessive amount of purposefully pandering details that
added nothing to the storyline, but trying to appease small audience
groups made the film too long and caused the final product to fall far
short of the what it could have been. Given his work on Seven, I
expected more, but will not be paying for this director&#x27;s films
anymore.
