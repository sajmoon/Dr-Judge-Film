In 2005, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, the first book in Swedish
journalist and writer Stieg Larsson&#x27;s &#x22;Millennium Series&#x22;, was
published; unfortunately, Larsson died without ever having the
opportunity to see his books published, let alone how popular they
would go on to become. The novel went on to become a worldwide best
seller, as did the two sequels: The Girl Who Played with Fire and The
Girl who Kicked the Hornet&#x27;s Nest. As the books grew in fame, and
Swedish film adaptations of the series were successful, so did the
likelihood of Hollywood film version.<br /><br />In order to meet the complexities within the novel, a director proved
capable of handling such complexities was needed; there was no better
choice than David Fincher. Fincher, whom in prior years had been
nominated for Academy Awards in Directing for The Curious Case of
Benjamin Button and The Social Network, was tailor made based on
previous films, such as Se7en, The Game and Zodiac. The decision to
film the movie on location in Sweden was an intelligent choice, as it
allowed the natural elements and locations to set the backdrop. The
biggest decision Fincher made, and one that would make or break the
movie, was casting choices. Daniel Craig, best known for playing the
latest incarnation of James Bond, does a fantastic job as
journalist/investigator Mikael Blomkvist. Craig&#x27;s best attribute is his
ability to play up to the strengths of his character, and with
Blomkvist it&#x27;s his charisma and submissiveness. Although Blomkvist is
one of the central characters of the film; without question, the star
is Lisbeth Salander, played by Rooney Mara. Mara gives an Academy Award
worthy performance as the socially awkward Salander. Mara commands the
screen in everything she does. Mara provides the character with such
depth, that you sympathize with Lisbeth and understand her need to not
attach herself to anyone. If an Oscar Nomination doesn&#x27;t come her way,
it would be disappointing. The rest of the supporting cast is also
impressive; Christopher Plummer continues to get better with age, as
Henrik Vanger, Stellan Skarsg&#xE5;rd is wonderful as Martin Vanger, and
Yorick van Wageningen gives one of the creepiest performances of
all-time as Nils Bjurman. <br /><br />No film is without flaws, and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has a
few. The one issue I had with the film was the opening credits; it
played like a music video and was entirely unnecessary and there&#x27;s one
sex scene near the end of the film that wasn&#x27;t needed. Aside from that,
I thought the film stayed very true to a book with approx. 480 pages.
With a book of that size, certain parts must be left out of the movie;
I truly believe that what wasn&#x27;t included, wouldn&#x27;t have improved the
film. Without a doubt, this film is one that merits a lot of
consideration come Awards season. Rooney Mara&#x27;s star has begun to blaze
ever so brightly and deservedly so. The transformation into her
character alone was impressive, but to look the part and be the part
are two entirely different things and she was able to achieve both.
David Fincher accomplished what he set out to do, to make a brutal,
mysterious and brooding film and I enjoyed the end result.<br /><br />Grade: A+<br /><br />visit our site at www.twodudereview.com
