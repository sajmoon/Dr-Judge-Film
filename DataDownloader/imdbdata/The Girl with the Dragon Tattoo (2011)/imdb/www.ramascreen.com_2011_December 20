faithful this film is to the original material, but I am a big fan of
the Swedish adaptation by Danish filmmaker Niels Arden Oplev. Now, I
know the fact that Hollywood is obsessed with remakes annoys the hell
out of us, but I think there can always be room for different
interpretation, different vision and approach and that&#x27;s what David
Fincher&#x27;s version excels in. It&#x27;s more detailed, more curious, and more
unafraid. It&#x27;s a superb and chilling thriller with an astounding
performance by Rooney Mara. Whether or not this version is better can
be argued but it certainly is a solid film&#x85; <br /><br />Rooney Mara, with her skinny body and goth hairstyle and excessive
piercings and tattoos and her attitude, I think Mara manages to give a
more complex Lisbeth Salander than Noomi Rapace&#x27;s portrayal. But it&#x27;s
mostly thanks to screenwriter Steven Zaillian who covers information
that the previous adaptation would simply skim or just talk about
instead of exposing it. Fincher and Zaillian want to seriously show how
dark, troubled, but motivated Lisbeth is. And some may consider this
approach to be too brutal or unnecessary but I think it&#x27;s no more
brutal than Fincher&#x27;s previous thrillers like Se7en. This is after all,
in its essence, a movie made solely for Fincher&#x27;s fans or those who are
comfortable with his style. Jeff Cronenweth&#x27;s cinematography work is
fantastic by the way, it plays on how much you can handle. It goes
along with the script that tends to be explanatory. Whatever loopholes
or gaps that the previous adaptation had, Fincher&#x27;s film fills it and
explains it in its own way.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander to me is a rebel, she lives by her own rules, but
she&#x27;s also by herself, this version wants to instill in her mind the
idea that perhaps she could be sociable or she could be considered
normal if she just gets that attention that she never did, and that&#x27;s
what warrants a different ending. Mara is absolutely phenomenal as
Lisbeth, it&#x27;s a defining role for Mara, she&#x27;s made it her own. She&#x27;s
fierce, highly driven, but there&#x27;s a sense of innocence to her as well.
She thinks her anger and actions are justified and the film
successfully encourages us to agree.<br /><br />All those tattoos and piercings are like &#x27;keep off&#x27; or &#x27;stay away&#x27;
sign, perhaps because of years of rough background, going from one
guardian to another, so when somebody genuine like Mikael Blomkvist
(Daniel Craig) comes along, he represents the safety that desperately
longs for but would never admit to. I think it&#x27;s smart that Fincher and
Zailian shows the estranged family side of Blomkvist, they see it as
important for Blomkvist to be able to relate to Henrik Vanger&#x27;s
(Christopher Plummer) dilemma and I think that&#x27;s a smart move. Craig is
the weakest link because his accent keeps going on and off, I&#x27;m not
sure if he even tries to sound Swedish at all, it&#x27;s quite the
distraction. But he works with what&#x27;s given to him, keep in mind that
the title is not Blomkvist with the dragon tattoo.<br /><br />Of course nowadays you can&#x27;t talk about Fincher&#x27;s movies without
talking a bit about the unconventional score by Oscar winners Atticus
Ross and Nine Inch Nail&#x27;s Trent Reznor. In fact, the movie pays an
amusing homage to NIN. Those of you film score aficionados would
probably find Ross and Reznor&#x27;s tunes for this film rather eerie and
chilling, which it then pretty much serve its purpose. Having said
that, at times I find the score a bit forceful and it&#x27;s like the same
soundwave echoing over and over again with the intent to hypnotize. I
don&#x27;t think the opening graphic credit is all that impressive, it&#x27;s an
interesting take but it looks out of place, it looks like it should be
a separate music video and it doesn&#x27;t necessarily introduce the tone of
the film that you&#x27;re about to see.<br /><br />THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is definitely not a movie for the faint
of heart, it&#x27;s a movie that would rattle your comfort cage, and I think
audiences will be divided, you&#x27;ll either truly love it, or truly detest
it, but there will hardly be a middle ground.<br /><br />-- www.Ramascreen.com --
