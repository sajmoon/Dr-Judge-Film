In re-reading my other reviews at stusblogs, it occurs to me that I
have very few words of praise for the movies I write about. I realize
that the rule of &#x22;Nothing good to say, then keep your mouth shut&#x22;
doesn&#x27;t apply in politics or film critiques, but I&#x27;m not sure the
opposite - &#x22;Nothing bad to say, then keep your mouth shut.&#x22; - is true
either. So in the interest of a more balanced approach, I offer this
review of a movie I thoroughly enjoyed.<br /><br />Full disclosure - I have not read the Stieg Larsson novels that serve
as the foundation for this movie. I once tried to listen to one of his
novels in a books on tape format and had to turn it off before I fell
asleep and crashed into a tree. I am sure that curled up in front of
the fire and diving into Larsson&#x27;s slavish attention to minutia is a
pleasant alternative to slogging around outside in the dead of a
Swedish winter. But I&#x27;m a Robert Frost kind of guy with miles to go
before I sleep and promises to keep. So unless you are candy for my
consciousness and swift on your predicates, I really don&#x27;t have time to
indulge.<br /><br />I went to the movie with my wife on a day off kid duty. The
grandparents were pinch hitting so we were able to see an adult movie
in a real theater for a change instead of renting one at the video
store and waiting until the kids were in bed and we were too tired to
watch and enjoy it. She had tried to read The Girl with the Dragoon
Tattoo and got bogged down about a third of the way in. Her one
hesitation when I suggested the Girl over the Ghost was her
apprehension that the movie would mirror the book&#x27;s plodding pace.<br /><br />Not to fear. In spite of it&#x27;s length - 140 minutes which is almost two
movies in today&#x27;s Hollywood - the movie holds your attention and keeps
you waiting for the next twist as any good suspense should. I won&#x27;t
belabor the plot. If you&#x27;re one of the brave ones who read the book,
then you know the story. You can enjoy the editing and decide if the
essential elements of the narrative were preserved in the film script.
If you haven&#x27;t read the book, then enjoy the mood and measure of a tale
that probes the dark side of human nature in a way that few films dare
to do anymore. Be prepared to glimpse the heart of darkness as much as
a film can show and not cross the line into the grotesque and prurient.<br /><br />And while you are swept up in the mystery and revulsion of serial
murder and family violence, take time to celebrate the actors and their
performances. Christopher Plummer will probably get a supporting actor
Oscar nomination for his portrayal of the guilt ridden patriarch.<br /><br />I have no doubt that Rooney Mara deserves an Oscar for her rendition of
Lisbeth Salander, the tattooed lady who bears no resemblance to
Groucho&#x27;s Lydia. I suspect Streep will get the nod for her Margaret
Thatcher interpretation since the Academy loves to pat itself on the
back for bringing history to the screen. But my non-vote goes to Rooney
who has made an incredible transition from professional football
royalty to silver screen artist.<br /><br />If you are passing out awards, I think you can skip Daniel Craig. I
still fault him for reducing Bond to a one dimensional cut out
caricature. Craig&#x27;s range as an actor starts at A and ends at A. This
approach doesn&#x27;t work for Bond but it is perfect for Mikael Blomkvist,
the disgraced, womanizing journalist who retreats into an historical
Who Done It to find redemption and a way back to his soulless,
philandering ways. Blomkvist really is the hero you love to hate.<br /><br />Bottom line - if you are in the mood for a grown up movie that will
leave you with something to talk about once you leave the theater, skip
the Ghost in the Protocol and give the Tattoo Lady named Lisbeth a
chance to entertain you.
