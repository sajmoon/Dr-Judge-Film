Loved both the Swedish and English versions. It is of course always
easier to improve on a previously built foundation and that was
certainly the case here. Though I am a fan of Danial Craig&#x27;s, the lead
could have been played by any number of males but Rooney Mara and
Noomey Rapace were both brilliant in their respective roles as Lizbeth.
The rest of the new ensemble was outstanding as well. The sexual aspect
was more vivid and emotionally charged. The biggest problem we had with
the latest version was that the musical soundtrack and ambient noise
were so intense that they drowned out a lot of dialog in a dialog
important movie. Should win no awards for the mixer.
