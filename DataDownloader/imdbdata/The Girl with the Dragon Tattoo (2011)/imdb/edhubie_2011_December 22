The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is brilliantly done in ways better then
the book and way better then the 2009 version. Though I didn&#x27;t dislike
the 09 version I thought they left out parts from the book that I
thought should&#x27;ve been shown. David Fincher&#x27;s version you pretty much
don&#x27;t have to read the book. Follows it amazingly. Took parts out that
could and needed to be taken out and shorten parts of the book with
beautifully done shorter scenes to get the point across which was
better then the books longer sequences. Even put a little twist at the
end that didn&#x27;t effect the story and was in my opinion better then the
book original. Best Fincher opening sequence movie title which he&#x27;s
been known for in the past with Trent Reznor and Karen O&#x27;s remake of
Led Zeppelin&#x27;s Immigrant song. Reznor does a great job with subtle
music that sets the mood and matches exactly the emotion you feel in
the scenes in the movie and story.<br /><br />Daniel Craig of course is great as Mickael but Rooney Mara easily
steals the movie in her performance as Lisbeth Salander. How she played
Lisbeth is exactly how I pictured her. The way the book describes her
quirks and how she holds and smokes her cigarette Rooney did perfectly.
She plays the blend of toughness and vulnerability that is Lisbeth
Salander in perfect blend. Making herself beautiful behind the tattoos
and piercings that Lisbeth is known to be in the books. I want to see
at least an Oscar nod for her role. As much as I love Keira Knightly
and Natalie Portman I can&#x27;t see them in that role after seeing Rooney
Mara play her. That&#x27;s how perfect she played her.
