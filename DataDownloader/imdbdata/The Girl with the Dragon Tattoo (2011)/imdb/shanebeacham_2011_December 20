I was really looking forward to The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo ever
since I learned that David Fincher had been attached to it. Now
normally I&#x27;d be angry at the fact of a foreign film being remade,
having seen and loved the Swedish version of the film, but I made an
exception with this one because of the cast and crew for this film.
Fincher, who directed films such as Fight Club, The Curious Case Of
Benjamin Button, and most recently The Social Network (my favorite film
of 2010 and what I thought should have won over The King&#x27;s Speech), has
a fantastic eye for filmmaking and has always impressed me with his
movies, save for Se7en which I wasn&#x27;t as huge a fan of as everyone else
was and even on that film I enjoyed a good bit. You throw in the writer
of Schindler&#x27;s List and Gangs Of New York, add actors like Daniel
Craig, Rooney Mara, Christopher Plummer and so many others, a score
from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (who also scored The Social
Network), and base it off the best selling book by Stieg Larsson
(that&#x27;s right, this isn&#x27;t a remake but rather a re-adaptation), it all
equals out to, in my opinion, the best film of the year by far.<br /><br />Now the first thing I want to say about this movie is Rooney Mara&#x27;s
performance. She knocks it out of the park portraying Lisbeth Salander.
She captured the mystery, the strangeness, the darkness, the
out-of-the- norm personality that this character had. She was
absolutely fantastic and I&#x27;m gonna be shocked as hell if she does not
get an Oscar nomination. And she really makes you feel for her in the
darker parts of this movie, which we&#x27;ll get to in a moment. And all the
other performances are great as well. Daniel Craig is great as usual
and there is great chemistry between him and Mara. Christopher Plummer,
as little as he&#x27;s in the movie, does a great job as well, in fact all
the actors do. This is a really well acted movie.<br /><br />Another thing that a lot of people have been talking about with this
film, as it was with the book and the Swedish film, was the moments
where sexual violence appears on screen. And while there are some
really uncomfortable moments in the film, that&#x27;s the reason why these
scenes succeed. They shock you and make you want to look away. And
that&#x27;s good, especially when the themes of this movie as well as the
source material were about this sort of thing, and the movie conveys it
perfectly. And while these scenes do linger in your mind, they never
distract you from the basis of this movie, which leads into my next
praise for the film.<br /><br />The story is really engaging. Even though I had seen the Swedish movie
and knew how the story as a whole was going to play out, I was able to
be really engaged in the movie and not focus on other things. It really
sucks you in, and Steve Zaillian, the writer of this movie, structures
the film in a way that is both similar and different to the Swedish
version, therefore doing what I hoped this film would do, which was
taking something that I already knew about and had watched before and
made it to where it was still interesting and there were changes made
to where I didn&#x27;t know how it was going to turn out. And that&#x27;s great.<br /><br />And everything technical about this movie succeeds. The score by Trent
Reznor and Atticus Ross is fantastic and really sucks you into the tone
of the picture. Jeff Cronenweth, who worked with Fincher on both Fight
Club and The Social Network, delivers fantastic cinematography. The
editing, the direction, the shots, everything about this movie
succeeds, making it a near perfect film.<br /><br />Now one small complaint I have about this film stems a little bit from
me viewing the Swedish version, in which they reveal a little more
about who Lisbeth is and one of the things she did in her past that
made it so troubled. And they didn&#x27;t use that here which kind of threw
me off a little. However, the more I think about it, the less it
becomes a concern because 1.) You can&#x27;t compare the two films and 2.)
there are bits and pieces shown in the films climax that shows that
Lisbeth deep down does have a soul. So the movie manages to overcome
that obstacle, and overall, I have nothing to say bad about it.<br /><br />Overall, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is a masterful film, it&#x27;s one
that you should definitely check out and I&#x27;ll definitely be checking it
out sometime soon. It&#x27;s directed, written, and acted well, and succeeds
in all that it sets out to do. You feel the emotion and darkness of the
film, Rooney Mara blew me away with her performance (and that body,
damn), and overall it lived up to my expectations. So out of ten, I got
to be honest, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is a 10. Go see this
movie NOW.
