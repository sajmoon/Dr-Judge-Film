I had not read the book, but I had expected the movie to be quite
violent in its treatment to women. It starts out quite slowly, but
picks up the pace and story quite soon.<br /><br />Rooney Mara plays her role quite extraordinarily well and so does
Daniel Craig. It is quite amazing how she plays out her role. She does
a splendid job to portray the girl with the dragon tattoo.<br /><br />Story was not as mysterious as I expected, but the suspense plays out
well through the movie. <br /><br />If you see the movie, you will definitely enjoy it. Waiting for the
rest of the series to be made soon.
