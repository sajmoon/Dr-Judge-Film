I have read the books and seen the Swedish movies.<br /><br />you know when i first heard that there would be an American remake i
thought it would be an action packed crap movie so i am a bit surprised
that it isn&#x27;t.<br /><br />There are some extremely disturbing scenes in the movie and i feel that
the Swedish version captured those a bit better. Overall acting was
good, i thought Mara did a good job as Sahlander although Naomi Rapace
was excellent and she will always be Sahlander.<br /><br />I know some complains at the disturbing scenes in the movie and i feel
they are even more disturbing in the Swedish version, but a movie that
moves you in any sort of way, whether its disturbing, funny, romantic
or in an angry way i think is reaching its goal. There are to many
movies today where you can just sit and watch and it doesn&#x27;t affect you
at all in any sort of way.<br /><br />Good job guys!
