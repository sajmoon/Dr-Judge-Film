OK. This movie was awesome. Go and see it now! <br /><br />My opinion as far as the Swedish version vs. the US version: The US
version is superior. The Swedish version was made on a &#x22;made for TV&#x22;
budget, and this one has the big budget in addition to top-notch actors
and a top-notch director. <br /><br />Believe it or not, my only complaint about the US version is Daniel
Craig. It was hard to accept him as being so helpless in some scenes.
Plus, at one point he is having a hard time hiking up a hill and he
states that he is really out of shape. That&#x27;s kind of silly in a movie
where the very obviously in shape Daniel Craig does a sex scene a few
minutes later. His performance wasn&#x27;t bad, but they should have done
more to separate him from his Bond image. Any scene where he is wearing
a suit, it is fitted just like Bond. I think a more &#x22;frumpy&#x22; wardrobe
would have helped....<br /><br />And Rooney Mara owned the role of Lisbeth. She had some big shoes to
fill after Noomi Rapace&#x27;s performance in the Swedish version. She was
equal to the task. Both were really good in the role, but if I had to
choose, I&#x27;d say Rooney was slightly better. Her performance was a
little more emotional, and her younger look really sold the character.<br /><br />Storywise: there&#x27;s not much new here. I&#x27;ve heard that this version is
supposed to be closer to the book (which I have not yet read), but
there wasn&#x27;t much difference here to make me believe that.<br /><br />If I had to point out one thing I liked better in the Swedish version,
it was Lisbeth&#x27;s parole officer (or whatever he&#x27;s called as far as
Swedish law goes). The actor was just a much creepier fellow in that
version (in my opinion). The dude in the US version was good and he
sells it. He&#x27;s just not as good by comparison.<br /><br />Overall: see this even if you loved the Swedish version because this
one is just as good, if not better.
