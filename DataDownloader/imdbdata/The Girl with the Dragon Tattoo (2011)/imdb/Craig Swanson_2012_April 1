The IMDb rating for this is higher than the Swedish version? What a
travesty. I admire Rooney Mara&#x27;s very different portrayal, but this
film is otherwise a sad shade of the remarkable first installment of
the Swedish series. I pity the fool who thinks otherwise. Plot elements
resonant with meaning in the original are here passed over or utterly
dissociated. I&#x27;ll not provide examples in this forum for fear of
displaying too much information. Viewers can decide for themselves. I
see nothing in this movie but greed. People can&#x27;t be bothered to read
subtitles? I suppose with a film of this popularity we can look forward
to versions in all major languages. If it&#x27;s released in Latin, I
promise to go see it.
