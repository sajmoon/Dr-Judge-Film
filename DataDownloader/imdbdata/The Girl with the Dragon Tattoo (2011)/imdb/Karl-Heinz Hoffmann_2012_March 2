As much as i respect, and in fact appreciate David Fincher&#x27;s work, this
film was really disappointing.<br /><br />This film is disrespectful to the people from Scandinavia who really
did a great job with the adaptation of Stieg Larsson&#x27;s books. And
disappointing because i expected a different and necessary adaptation,
once this is a film made shortly after the Scandinavian.<br /><br />Excellent interpretations from almost everyone in an extraordinary
cast. But scene after scene, the feeling of d&#xE9;j&#xE0; vu is intense and
unfortunately accurate. All the key scenes are desperately similar to
the &#x22;older&#x22; film.<br /><br />If there wasn&#x27;t the other film, this would be a masterpiece.
