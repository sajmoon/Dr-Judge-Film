Bonnie &#x26; Clyde get a twist in this futuristic/sci-fi thriller.<br /><br />The starting of the film felt a bit weak, the establishment of the
movies world was a little faded for me.<br /><br />But ounce it got to the middle of the movie and the action started,
then it become a much more enjoyable film.<br /><br />It&#x27;s a fantasy world where there are only 25-year-olds or younger
people - funny how that translates to only good looking young people.<br /><br />Anyways, the acting was decent, Amanda Seyfried (Sylvia Weis) also did
a pretty nice job, imo.<br /><br />Overall, it&#x27;s a very watchable and enjoyable sci-fi thriller. And it is
worth watching for its unique concept.
