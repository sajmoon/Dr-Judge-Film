Cool concept of a movie and Timberlake is pretty good in it, but the
dialog is clunky at best and there isn&#x27;t any chemistry between the co-
star. Justin lives in the ghetto, Amanda lives in upper society. The
only currency is time itself. Having time, keeps you alive. They never
explain how people are engineer that their lives are measure by a
timer, it just is. With everything you do, you have to pay for it in
giving up time on your life. You can get time back by borrowing it,
stealing it, or being super rich. Rich guys comes into the ghetto,
tired of living, he gives all his time (a century) to Timberlake.
Justin, having all the time in the world, goes to see where the rich
lives. He meets Amanda and bada bing, they are being chase. The whole
premise of the movie is based on people running out of time and
controlling time Like I said, good concept, but not so good execution.
It just flat in a lot of places, A LOT. Amanda isn&#x27;t ask to do a whole
lot and she doesn&#x27;t to include deliver her lines with any convictions.
The movie should be called &#x22;Justin Timberlake gets chased&#x22; Because is
on him 90% of the time. Everyone else is just cardboard background
people, to include the guy playing Amanda&#x27;s dad and the cop that chases
Justin. And the end of the movie is so anti-climatic and boring and it
makes no real sense. Still, if you must see it, Rent it from Redbox for
a dollar or wait for it on Netflix or HBO.
