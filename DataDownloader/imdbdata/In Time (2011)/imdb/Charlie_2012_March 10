In the future the world will be composed of a demographic that is
critical to the enjoyment of 18-34 year old movie goers. Just like beer
commercials, there is no one over 25 years old to gum up the works.
Everyone&#x27;s mom is a milf. Science has figured out how to make people
immortal, but has evidently forgotten how to make a car manufactured
after 1985. Most of the world looks like either Century City or the Los
Angeles river basin.<br /><br />Just like today there is the 99%, who live literally day-to-day, and
the 1% whose luxury is predicated on inequality. Hopefully the movie
viewers (the 99%) will not notice that the actors, the writers and the
studio are trying to get into the 1% by make the others pay for the
privilege of watching this dreck.<br /><br />Ah, it&#x27;s not THAT bad. I just get sick of future dystopias where the
writers stopped after pitching the concept and didn&#x27;t bother creating a
world (or characters for that matter) that have any nuance. Think of
all of the visual detail in a movie like Blade Runner. That is what
this movie lacks.
