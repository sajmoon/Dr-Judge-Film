It&#x27;s not as flashy in terms of effects as other sci-fi movies but I
believe &#x27;In Time&#x27; has successfully conveyed the message it was suppose
to deliver: To appreciate the NOW - and spending it on Quality Moments
that has real value in our lives. It gives us a view of &#x27;time&#x27; in a
different angle, from one that we casually dismiss or take for granted
in our daily lives - to one that means starvation, losing all the
comforts in life even Death. From a luxury to a necessity. <br /><br />The actors are apt for their roles and are well chosen.<br /><br />I must admit though it had become like a futuristic &#x27;Bonnie and Clyde&#x27;
gig towards the end. <br /><br />Other than that it is a very good movie to watch without making you
feel you wasted time or money.
