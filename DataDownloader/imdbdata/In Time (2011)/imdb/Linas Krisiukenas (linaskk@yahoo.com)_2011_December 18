Justin Timberlake is quickly becoming one of the most popular Hollywood
actors of 2011. After performing in two romantic comedies (Friends with
Benefits, Bad Teacher), he finally got leading role in Andrew Niccol&#x27;s
sci-fi movie In Time, where he has to do a bit more than just be
handsome. In In Time Andrew Niccol (writer of great movies like The
Terminal and The Truman Show) presents the idea of people stop aging at
the age of 25 (50 years old woman is played by Olivia Wilde, God bless
this technology). But everything is not as idyllic as it sounds, after
reaching 25, your time is limited to only one more year, after your
time expires you are simply shut down because there is no space left on
the Earth. Time is a currency, a key to get everything from cup of
coffee to couple of prostitutes, so logic is simple &#x96; the less you
spend, the longer you live.<br /><br />The story is quite simple: Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) was ordinary,
but exceptionally honorable Ghetto boy counting his last days and one
night he accidentally got rich, at the same being accused of murder. He
runs away from Ghetto, becomes a rebellious fugitive and tries to make
world a better place. Oh, he also grabs attractive rich man&#x27;s daughter
as hostage on his way.<br /><br />In Time tries to be action thriller and has enough elements to be
considered as such &#x96; racing cars (ugly modified, weird sounds making
American muscles, I must mention), hiding, running, chasing, shooting
scenes &#x96; but its social aspect rises above them all. Relationship
between rich and poor, drama of both sides, different views to life
(immortality and 25 years long insecure life; living free and living
surrounded by bodyguards and high walls), finally, an allusion to
importance of time and money in our real lives.<br /><br />The main idea of not aging after 25 made whole cast choice a bit
limited; all the actors had to be really young, sometimes lack of
experience can be felt, especially when the lead actor is not a real
professional. However, J.T.&#x27;s acting was not bad, so as it was not very
impressive. Age restrictions didn&#x27;t prevent Cillian Murphy from showing
good performance, even though he is a whole decade older than his bad
guy character &#x96; Time Keeper.<br /><br />Besides really unique main idea, In Time sometimes might feel like a
sci-fi flavored Romeo and Juliet&#x27;s love story, with Robin Hood&#x27;ish
elements at second half. It has interesting and believable environment,
scenes are filled with catchy dialogues, which only improves atmosphere
(&#x22;Will: Four minutes for a cup of coffee? Will&#x27;s Friend: Yesterday it
was three! Coffee worker: You want coffee or you want to reminisce?&#x22;).
Sadly, this movie manages to keep interest only for the first half,
later on it becomes chaotic and predictable at the same time.<br /><br />To end with, In Time is not a bad movie, but it probably won&#x27;t make
people who do not like sci-fi change their opinion. Unique ideas like
this do not come very often, it had a lot of potential, but, I believe,
not all of it was used. Anyway, it still remains pretty interesting new
experience, when everything in cinemas starts to give sense of
repeating.
