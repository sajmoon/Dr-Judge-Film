A very unusual film screen-play, well written and shot, don&#x27;t expect
any CGI effects here, this is a very down to Earth sci-fi that bears
more than a passing resemblance to our current problem with world
banks. Surprisingly Justin Timberlake puts in a very professional
performance, and not a song in sight, Timberlake carries the part with
a very grounded performance being so laid back that he is almost
horizontal. Amanda Seyfried submits a polished performance although her
make-up makes her look like one of those Japanese animations of what a
European looks like, complete with over-sized eyes. The film holds the
attention from the first to the last frame and provokes some emotion
from the viewer on several levels. Certainly worth a watch, not quite a
Rolex, but much better than a Timex.
