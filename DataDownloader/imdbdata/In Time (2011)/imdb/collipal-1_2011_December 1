14 years ago, the film Gattaca revealed director and screenwriter
Andrew Niccol as a filmmaker interested in genuine science fiction,
based on fascinating ideas and not on simple scenes of futuristic
action. Later, Niccol made the interesting Simone and the excellent
Lord of War. However, I think that In Time, his most recent film, is
the first misstep in his filmography, because its vaguely creative
premise crumbles due to a poorly built and executed screenplay.<br /><br />The main problem from In Time is that the universe built by Niccol is
excessively improbable, absurd and full of arbitrary and
incomprehensible rules. In other words, the premise from this film does
not work as the livelihood of a narrative at all.<br /><br />And besides of that hard-to-swallow premise, we have weak narrative
mechanics, the inscrutable motivations from the characters (the heroes
as well as the villains) and the failed dramatic moments (not to
mention the romantic ones) which are not able to provoke even the
slightest level of emotion (except for involuntary laughs, in the worst
of the cases). In general, In Time left me with the impression of
having been conceived during a drunken night from Niccol, in which he
said: &#x22;What if we had to pay with our remaining time of life instead of
with money?&#x22; And a friend of his (who was equally intoxicated) replied:
&#x22;Hey! That&#x27;s really deep! You should write a movie about that&#x22;.
However, Niccol refused to hear the opinion from the friend of his who
was not drunk, who asked: &#x22;But, how would that economy work? What
society would accept to receive an absolute time of expiration? And how
would that be possible from the organic point of view?&#x22;. Then, Niccol
made the fatal mistake of answering like this: &#x22;What does it matter?
It&#x27;s science fiction...I can do whatever I want!&#x22;.<br /><br />I think that that arrogance made In Time to sink. Its development is
composed by &#x22;cool&#x22; scenes which do not resist even the slightest
logical analysis. As examples, I can mention: the poker game (or
whatever it is), in which the life is literally played (The hero&#x27;s big
plan is based on an impossible luck strike?); the ride through &#x22;time
zones&#x22; which goes from ghettos for poor people to elite enclaves for
the rich ones (Where the hell do the cooks, gardeners and stylists from
the powerful ones live?); the car chase between two beautiful classic
cars (How can the hero drive on such an expert way when he could barely
pay for his bus ticket a few hours before?). All those elements are
combined in order to make In Time a movie which is the exact opposite
of the genuine science fiction...stupid when it pretends to be smart,
conventional when it pretends to be innovative, and lacking of any
emotion during its &#x22;exciting&#x22; moments.<br /><br />As for the leading actors, Justin Timberlake feels absolutely forced,
while Amanda Seyfried brings a credible performance. However, despite
her competent work, I cannot recommend In Time, because it is a boring
and poor sci-fi film.
