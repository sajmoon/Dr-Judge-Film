IN TIME is not a complete waste of your time. It&#x27;s just... so...
disappointing. And it was really close to being good.<br /><br />The writing is just awful. I can&#x27;t believe this was scripted by the
same person who wrote GATTACA (one of my all-time top 5 favorites).
Justin Timberlake is a good actor, but there&#x27;s only so much that can be
done when starting from poor dialogue. If IN TIME is your type of
movie, but you were disappointed, try GATTACA.<br /><br />Terrible production. It&#x27;s supposed to take place in a slum, but really
felt sterile. Like a Dukes Of Hazzard episode shot on a Hollywood back
lot. The streets were too clean, everything was too quiet and
organized. Just throw in a couple bland extras in the background, have
the cast say &#x22;ghetto&#x22; a few times, and expect the audience to accept
it.<br /><br />The storyline, particularly the last 30 minutes, was pretty much what I
would&#x27;ve written for the ending - back when I was in the 7th grade.<br /><br />Unrealistic math. These people are living day-to-day - literally. It&#x27;s
just too close to believe. Some more thought into this really awesome
concept could have saved the idea.<br /><br />So you start with a bad script, silly caricatures, sad dialogue, then
direct the movie with no sense of excitement or tension, while not
doing any production to give the movie the correct look and feel, and
you have IN TIME, a neat idea, sadly disappointing. Just so close, but
really forgettable.
