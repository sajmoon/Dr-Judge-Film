In Time is set in the future where people stop aging at 25, but are
engineered to live only one more year, having the means to buy your way
out of the situation is a shot at immortal youth. Here, Will Salas
finds himself accused of murder and on the run with a hostage - a
connection that becomes an important part of the way against the
system.(IMDb). In Time is written and directed by Andrew Niccol. There
isn&#x27;t really anything too impressive in this film direction wise. It
looks a typical action film and is pacing is a typical action pacing.
What really holds In Time together is the intriguing story. I think it
is a good Sci-Fi story that is entertaining throughout.The writing is a
bit eh, there are cheesy lines and action clich&#xE9;s. In Time has pretty
good cast with: Justin Timberlake, Amanda Seyfried, Olivia Wilde,
Cillian Murphy, &#x26; Vincent Kartheiser. The performances are what you
expect; they&#x27;re good, but nothing special. Timberlake has always stood
out as a good actor and I really enjoy seeing him as an actor. Seyfried
still sucks as an actress and I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;ll ever be good. The
best performance in In Time is by, Vincent Kartheiser. Kartheiser is an
extremely talented actor and his talent shows in this film. In Time may
lack in many aspects to be a good film, but it didn&#x27;t stop me from
being entertained. Overall In Time is an OK film and can be a skip for
some.
