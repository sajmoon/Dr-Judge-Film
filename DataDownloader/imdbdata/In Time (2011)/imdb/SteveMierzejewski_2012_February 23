I suppose there are hard core science fiction fans who may pick apart
some of the premises in this movie, I don&#x27;t think it would be hard to
do so, but, just accept the idea and enjoy the ride. The concept is
interesting enough and the story is compelling enough to keep most of
us entertained.<br /><br />I have been quite critical of Justin Timberlake in some of his recent
performances, but he is credible here, perhaps just one step away from
a serious lead role. In fact, most of the acting is up to par. The
movie is true to itself in that it is guided by the concept and not by
what they think the audience expects. This is made clear in a scene in
a hotel room where I expected the obligatory sexual encounter, despite
the fact that the two lead characters were in danger all the time.
However, adherence to realism triumphed over audience expectations and,
perhaps, even higher ratings. The director deserves some credit for
this.<br /><br />In short, this is a film worth watching that will give you much to
think about in the process.
