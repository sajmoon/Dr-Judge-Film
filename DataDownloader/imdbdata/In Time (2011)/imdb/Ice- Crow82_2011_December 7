Why all the hate? I thought &#x22;In time&#x22; was very good. Although I want
too hate Justin Timberlake, I can&#x27;t fault him as an actor, and too tell
you the truth, I&#x27;ve been impressed with most off the movies I&#x27;ve seen
him in (I have too say even his music, though not my kind off thing, is
good for what it is).<br /><br />I Believe that Timberlakes presence is perhaps what has cursed &#x22;In
time.&#x22; An otherwise original movie, that sci-fi fans should be lapping
up. Maybe it would off done better if it starred someone the average
bloke thinks is cooler, but for now it&#x27;s probably a film guys are
getting dragged too by their girlfriends. If my girlfriend had dragged
me along too see this though, I&#x27;d off been glad, because it&#x27;s
entertaining.<br /><br />Maybe I&#x27;m too overwhelmed with excitement when something is actually
&#x22;original&#x22; these days (it does cause me too dish out a high rating
straight away) but the unique premise off this flick is what people who
didn&#x27;t particularly enjoy it even admit too it having. Judging it by
everything else that&#x27;s in it though, I still think it&#x27;s good. It&#x27;s got
a good cast, some half decent (though small amount of) action, and even
uses the way clocks are always counting down in the movie too add some
extra excitement too it. Plus Amanda Seyfried looks great in it. Oooft!<br /><br />&#x22;In time&#x22; also doesn&#x27;t overdo it with the way the future that is
represented here looks, meaning it will age reasonably well. Even
though it hasn&#x27;t been that highly praised now (people complain that
it&#x27;s not explained how these people off the future are the way they
are, even though it clearly says that they have been genetically
engineered this way at the beginning) I can see it becoming a cult
classic off sorts in the future.
