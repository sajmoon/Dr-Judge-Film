I went into this one with the lowest expectations, and boy was I wrong.
For one thing, before I saw his name in the opening credits, I had no
idea this was an Andrew Niccol film, and since he is the stylish,
stylized genius who gave us GATTACA, suddenly things were looking up.
Then, wow, this cast! Sure, I knew about Justin Timberlake and Amanda
Seyfried, but check out the rest of them: Olivia Wilde, Cillian Murphy,
THE BIG BANG THEORY&#x27;s Johnny Galecki, WHITE COLLAR&#x27;s Matt Bomer and
genre-It Kid, Alex Pettyfer. I mean, come on! How can a movie be
directed by Andrew Niccol AND contain so much of the pretty AND also be
science fiction and NOT be completely, exactly, entirely the kind of
movie that I would love, love, love? <br /><br />Want to know why my expectations were low? I&#x27;d seen a snippet of the
trailer -- which just looked to me like a bunch of TRANSFORMERS-style
running around the place -- and had read the basic film synopsis sent
to me by Fox Studios&#x27; publicity department. So what I knew was this: <br /><br />&#x22;Welcome to a world where time has become the ultimate currency. You
stop aging at 25, but there&#x27;s a catch: you&#x27;re genetically-engineered to
live only one more year, unless you can buy your way out of it. The
rich &#x22;earn&#x22; decades at a time (remaining at age 25), becoming
essentially immortal, while the rest beg, borrow or steal enough hours
to make it through the day. When a man from the wrong side of the
tracks is falsely accused of murder, he is forced to go on the run with
a beautiful hostage. Living minute to minute, the duo&#x27;s love becomes a
powerful tool in their war against the system.&#x22; <br /><br />Why was I hesitant about this premise? Because, come on! How many
sci-fi tropes do you want to hit? Predetermined age-limit to combat
overpopulation: LOGAN&#x27;S RUN, among many others. Being able to
effectively purchase immortality: Elizabeth Moon&#x27;s Familias Regnant
series, among many others. Falsely accused and on the run in a future,
dystopian society: hello MINORITY REPORT, THE ISLAND and who knows what
all else! But you know what? Much like he did in GATTACA, where he took
the already well-worn path of the genetically-superior being not
necessarily being superior and made it his own, writer/director Niccol
brings a freshness, almost a whole new sensibility to these and the
other trappings of classic sci-fi he offers up to us here. We also get
action, suspense, romance, humor, social commentary, gorgeous visuals
and, as I mentioned, bucket loads of the pretty -- I would pay good
money to see Matt Bomer and Olivia Wilde in anything; impossibly
beautiful doesn&#x27;t even begin to cover that blessed pair -- and wow,
what a thoroughly, unexpectedly fun, truly thought-provoking and
utterly engaging time this movie was. I am still flabbergasted at just
how much I dug this. I actually broke into spontaneous applause as the
credits rolled. And I can&#x27;t wait to see it again.<br /><br />But the big question: how was JT? He was, I will have you know,
excellent. I have long felt that there was something effortlessly
engaging about his whole persona, whether in interviews or on SNL or in
roles as diverse as beleaguered rookie cop in EDISON, Napster hipster
Sean Parker in THE SOCIAL NETWORK or squirrelly substitute Scott in BAD
TEACHER. He doesn&#x27;t really seem to act: he just IS. Here, he is an
unlikely action hero, but somehow, he pulls it off in grand style,
looking simultaneously earnest, dangerous and adorable, and easily
holding his own even alongside someone the likes of Murphy, whose
hypnotic eyes can convey more in one blink of an eyelash than many a
lesser actor can get across in an entire soliloquy.<br /><br />All of the other performances are top notch, particularly from Wilde
and Galecki -- who brings most of the funny in the film -- and hey, you
know who else is in here! Vincent Kartheiser, AKA Connor from ANGEL!
And he&#x27;s not bad at all, either. In fact, he and Pettyfer are our main
bad guys, and both pull of criminal cool pretty damn well.<br /><br />The long and the short of it? See this film. It&#x27;s entertaining, it has
a message, it is a feast for the eyes, and we definitely need to be
encouraging more of this kind of genre filmmaking. True, it&#x27;s not a
truly original piece of work. In fact, in addition to all of the other
things it reminds me of, it also brings to mind EQUILIBRIUM -- not so
much in its content but in the way that it is essentially a mashup of a
whole bunch of established ideas out of speculative fiction, but gives
them new life (Equilibrium went with BRAVE NEW WORLD, FAHRENHEIT 451,
1984 -- and also LOGAN&#x27;S RUN as its inspirations). But that&#x27;s okay; I
really like EQUILIBRIUM, too. <br /><br />In doing a little research for this review, I discovered that the
ever-litigious SF luminary Harlan Ellison is suing Niccol and various
studio-types for plagiarism, given this movie&#x27;s similarity to his 1965
short story &#x22;&#x27;Repent, Harlequin!&#x27; Said the Ticktockman.&#x22; Having not
read the piece in question, I can&#x27;t comment, but considering Ellison&#x27;s
unrelenting pursuit of copyright infringers, one would think that if
Niccol WAS to knowingly steal from anyone, he&#x27;d have picked a safer
target. After all, most of the ideas in this movie can be found all
over Sci-Fi, not to mention in Action, and Drama and Crime, as well.<br /><br />But sometimes it&#x27;s not about the provenance of the ideas, it&#x27;s what you
do with them. And here, Niccol has done wonders. (As long as you
suspend your disbelief and go with the fact that Timberlake, Seyfried
and the rest are, biologically, only 25. Luckily, Hollywood&#x27;s been
conditioning us to do just that for years.) <br /><br />-- Rachel Hyland, Geek Speak Magazine
