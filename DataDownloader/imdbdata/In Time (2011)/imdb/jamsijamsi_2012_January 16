Allowing an idea to govern - inside one on beforehand astute and
innovative script - weakens the end result considerably.<br /><br />I realise one cannot expect Oscar winning achievements of a cast
consisting of teens barely entered puberty. But it all feels so
high-school-drama-class as you TRY to believe statements from one youth
after another claiming to be, and trying to act, as humans with
immanent experience of 75-year olds...<br /><br />Perphaps the casting crew should have focused more on skilled and
talented young actors, rather than pulchritude alike, the latter - in
modern media - often infesting and eventually diluting any kind of
production line hoping for sustaining exceptional and widespread
popularity and achieve enormous sales; a blockbuster.<br /><br />This is sad, since this production has the very basics of a potential
sci-fi classic: A fresh and clean idea of future aesthetics, fitting
the physical and psychological environment.<br /><br />I&#x27;m sure this entrance in the movie history books wan&#x27;t be a total box
office bomb (the target group being easily persuaded teens will
guarantee expense coverage, at least), but I&#x27;m equally certain the
producers will have hoped for more than that. In time.
