Very nice sci-fi thriller starring Justin Timberlake and Amanda
Seyfried. The plot is quite unique, you age clock is the currency. You
can earn it and spent it very quickly. Simple to follow and although
this seem a fairly low budget affair, the whole thing always seem
fairly plausible apart from people wandering the street in almost
zombie like fashion.. With interest in the plot the rest of the film
seems to fall into place very well - there are parts however that may
have been improved by the script or simple editing.. A quaint vision of
the future that keeps its feet firmly on the ground.. and that is a
rare thing these days..
