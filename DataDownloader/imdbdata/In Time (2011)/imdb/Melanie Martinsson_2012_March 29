If you watch this, you are going to watch a really cheesy movie, which
I myself felt like watching at the time, so why not?<br /><br />But you were warned.<br /><br />Firstly, the script is actually really good, by an obviously talented
screenwriter.<br /><br />Secondly, the director seems ambitious but completely fails to deliver,
and I respect that though, there is not much to work with here, because
of;<br /><br />Thirdly, in each and every shot of this movie Justin Timberlake makes a
duck of himself as an actor in my opinion, and pretty much the rest of
the cast is obviously ambitious, which I respect, but totally fails to
deliver in exactly every shot. <br /><br />And then enter: Cillian Murphy. Always nice to have him given screen
time. He pretty much makes the whole movie. Gotta love him.<br /><br />The rest is just not good, if you ask me. I did not have a pleasant
viewing with my girl tonight. Probably wouldn&#x27;t have by myself either.
