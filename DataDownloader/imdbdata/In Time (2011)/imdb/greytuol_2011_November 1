Looking at this film and its concept I was intrigued. With this said
the film does fail to live up to the potential of its concept. One of
the few major issues i have with this film is the lack of back-story
with regards to the implementation of the &#x27;body clock&#x27;, along with the
lack of true quality acting and a well written script. As a result of
this what the viewer will get from this film experience are moments
(and i mean moments) where you are enjoying the film, but by the end of
it all you can reflect on what you have seen and notice that you could
have done a lot more with your money if you had not gone to watch In
Time.<br /><br />...What a pity
