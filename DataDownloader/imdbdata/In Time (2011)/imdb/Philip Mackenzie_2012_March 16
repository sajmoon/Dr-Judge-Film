In Time<br /><br />I watched this film with friends not knowing anything about the
plot,found it was a great way to spend a couple of hours.<br /><br />The cast are an interesting bunch each with a strong screen presence.
Having seen Justin Timberlake in the Social Network,i knew he could act
but in this film he provides a polished performance.<br /><br />The actor Cillian Murphy who reminds me of Tom Hardy in Inception plays
the head timekeeper holds you to the screen with his unwavering
dedication to his employers .<br /><br />Amanda Seyfried who plays Sylvia Weis and Justin Timberlake grow to
have a believable on screen chemistry.<br /><br />Another larger than life character played by Alex Pettyfer is Fortis
who plays a bad guy but with an upmarket presence.<br /><br />In a nutshell i would say this film has more to it than you first think
It raises some moral issues which i am not going to go into as it would
spoil the film for you.I am a sci fi fan so may be biased here but
ignore the negative reviews and go and enjoy a sci fi classic I feel
there are a few similarities to Logans Run but maybe that is just me.<br /><br />Phill Mackenzie
