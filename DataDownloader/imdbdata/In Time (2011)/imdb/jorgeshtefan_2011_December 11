Too many people are missing point in splitting hair looking for plot
holes. And movie IS full of that, but thats not why this movie is worth
to watch.<br /><br />Point is world is *beep* place with 100 billionaires and 7 billion poor
people who live just like protagonist in this movie, from day to day
struggling every day for food, clothes, mortgage... Life.<br /><br />Movie is about injustice and poverty imposed by parallel &#x22;Time (life)
owners&#x22; which in real world would be : Bilderberg group, FED, EU, USA,
G8, IMF, Banksters, WTO, WB, London Club and other global institution
whose purpose is to indirectly kill as many as they need just to make
few people immortal. Just like in movie.<br /><br />This film is pure reality, obviously written and produced in a hurry to
support &#x22;Occupy movement&#x22;.<br /><br />Never the less I gave it 10.<br /><br />I didn&#x27;t watched just to find some plot holes, or to say Justin is bad
actor, which i think he is. I watched cos it was interesting and true.
