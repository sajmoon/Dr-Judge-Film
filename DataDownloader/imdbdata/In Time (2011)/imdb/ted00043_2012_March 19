This Is A Movie Where As I Said Above It Had Good Ideas But It Fell
Short. The Biggest Example Of This Is The Character Of Henry Hamilton
Being Tired Of Life And Giving All His Time To Will Salas And Killing
Himself, That Is Something That I&#x27;d Imagine Most People Would Do If
Ever This Film Became A Reality. I Also Think For The Information That
This Film Tosses At You It Is A Bit Short, It Could&#x27;ve Explained How
Humanity Got From - Well - What It Is Now To A World Where Everyone
Only Lives To Be 25 Physically And Mentally People Can Live For A
Million Years, And How They Got A Clock Inside Their Arm. If They Spent
A Bit More Time On This It May Be Better Than What It Was. I Hate
Sounding Like Other Reviewers But This Time Everyone Was Right.
