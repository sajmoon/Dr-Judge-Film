2011_November 4 
I saw a trailer of the movie some time ago, and I waited it since. I
found the whole &#x22;time&#x22; idea interesting and philosophical, simple and
yet so innovative. So I went to see this movie with very high
expectations. But all that changed after watching the first ten minutes
of the movie. My fist disillusion was the acting, which was poor to say
the least. No one gave me the impression that they really care about
the time they have, the actors were rather like the characters of a
computer game. There was no attraction between the two main characters
and the director tried to save the most dramatic scenes by choosing
large angles rather than focusing on people. But maybe all that was
because of the poor script. I don&#x27;t understand how can you fail
starting with such a good idea, but Andrew Niccol did. He tried very
hard to make the life of his characters miserable and they concentrated
so much on how to survive one more day that the denouement seemed
random. Maybe it should have remained just a trailer. After all, Justin
needs just four minutes to save the world...
