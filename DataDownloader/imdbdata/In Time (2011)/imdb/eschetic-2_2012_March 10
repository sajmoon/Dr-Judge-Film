The idea of taking the basic idea behind the classic LOGAN&#x27;S RUN, where
in order to stretch limited resources to the maximum an earlier
generation had limited all life expectancy to a set maximum (around the
age of the average movie-goer), and giving it a more complex and
&#x22;sophisticated&#x22; extension (some half thought out clap-trap about the
potential for and downside of immortality based on the shorter lives of
others is a late afterthought) was not a bad one, but positing a
society where all aging stops at 25 *without* offering an explanation
of how society got reorganized on these lines also presents certain
problems which these film makers proved unequal to.<br /><br />With no &#x22;character&#x22; actors available under the concept (the closest we
are allowed is The Big Bang Theory&#x27;s excellent Johnny Galecki, wasted
in a small role as Timberlake&#x27;s sidekick in the film&#x27;s early scenes),
the film has a real problem finding characters the film goer finds
interesting enough to care about. Timberlake and his co-star, Ms.
Seyfried, have the requisite charisma and, in Mr. Timberlake&#x27;s case, a
growing acting ability, but the other twenty-somethings all tend to
blend into each other with only Cillian Murphy&#x27;s latter-day &#x22;Javert&#x22;
and (thanks to his TV personality) Matt Bomer as a suicidal &#x22;century
holder&#x22; making much of an impression - and the film&#x27;s extremely cold
heart has too weak a beat to sustain interest even when it leaves its
original concept and enters &#x22;Bonnie &#x26; Clyde&#x22; territory.<br /><br />When you can&#x27;t care about the characters and you give up on any hope of
a &#x22;happy ending&#x22; near mid-film (having failed to say how &#x22;the system&#x22;
came into being, they can&#x27;t make us believe in the financial principles
it would take to bring it down - let alone return the leads to a safe
life) and worst of all, when the journey ceases to strike the viewer as
credible, the film which pretends to concentrate on time as a metaphor
for money risks leaving the audience resenting the time it&#x27;s taken from
IT - and at movie prices these days, that&#x27;s a pretty fair parallel -
long before the silly ending.<br /><br />What a pity. I had really been looking forward to this one.
