Taking off horrible car actions scenes and the unstoppable message of
&#x22;time is money&#x22;, In Time is a brilliant movie, with an original idea
(at least I haven&#x27;t seen a movie treating the &#x22;life span&#x22; like this one
before).<br /><br />Timberlake does a good job on his character, and its impossible to see
Johnny Galecki and do not remember him on The Big Bang Theory. Because
his laugh is exactly the same, haha. Apart from these two, there is
some bad actors doing poor acting. Something to take care of, if
someone intent to make a sequel (or prequel, because how science
evolved to the point on put a clock on people&#x27;s arm and make them share
life time like a USB cable from arm to arm is still a mystery).<br /><br />Right in first 10 minutes we can see we&#x27;re about to get bored about how
many times they will spend talking about time and enjoying life, and
bla bla bla. Really, this was supposed to be subjected, and not
repeated throughout the whole plot.<br /><br />Another issue is the car action extremely slowly moving scenes. Is this
the best stunt man can do? They&#x27;re clearly the worse part of the movie.
They&#x27;re so bad produced that we can see when the car is &#x22;running&#x22; 5
miles per hour. Really, they suck.<br /><br />What salves In Time is photography and the fact producers used old
muscle cars instead of prototypes in a futuristic scyfy movie. That was
really a well though idea! Amazing! it gives a kind of retro atmosphere
to it. Thumbs up! Apart for some mistakes, In Time is really a great
movie. To bad it doesn&#x27;t make you think like one.
