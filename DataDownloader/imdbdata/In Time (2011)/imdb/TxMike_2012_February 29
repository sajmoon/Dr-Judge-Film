It is a time in the future when genetic refinements have allowed human
bodies to age to 25 and no further. However as you reach exactly 25,
your timer kicks in and, unless you earn more time, you have exactly
one year, only 52 weeks, to live. However if you can earn (or beg or
steal or borrow) more time then you can potentially live forever. Your
own time is cleverly displayed in yellow-green glowing numbers on your
left arm, constantly counting down the seconds. This can get very
dramatic, and several times does, as the few remaining seconds count
down to zero.<br /><br />To me this is an allegory using time instead of money to comment on our
social issues. Where the powerful may have thousands or millions of
years, while the ordinary citizens live from day-to-day. Instead of
wondering where their next meal is coming from they wonder where their
next 24 hours of time will come from.<br /><br />Cillian Murphy is Raymond Leon, a &#x22;time keeper&#x22;. He has been doing it
for 50 years and it is not at all clear how old he actually is, but it
certainly is at least 75. But he looks 25. He chases down those
suspected of gaining time by criminal activity.<br /><br />Justin Timberlake is arguably in the lead role as Will Salas. He lives
in Time Zone 12 which is their ghetto. When he comes upon a man who is
over 100 years old (he looks 25) and with over 100 years of &#x22;time&#x22;, and
just tired of living any longer, when they both fall asleep gives Will
all his time except 5 minutes, which allows him to walk across the
street to a bridge over the Los Angeles River and when his time counts
down to zero he falls dead into the river. This leads authorities to a
manhunt and a convenient street camera identifies Will as a suspect.<br /><br />The movie is novel and entertaining, we enjoyed it. As I watched
fictional characters trying to figure out how they would get their next
time increment, I naturally thought of all those people in our real
world not knowing for sure how they would get money for next month&#x27;s
rent or for food. It really is an issue, the small % of very wealthy
people having more than they will ever need while so many are starving
and homeless.<br /><br />Amanda Seyfried is Sylvia Weis, the daughter of a time-wealthy man who
owns a number of businesses. She and Will become unlikely fugitives and
eventually love interests.<br /><br />SPOILERS: After overcoming the time-keeper&#x27;s hunt, and almost running
out of time, Will and Sylvia bond emotionally and become a team. A sort
of Bonnie and Clyde, destined to knock off all the big time-keeping
banks and redistribute time to those who don&#x27;t have much left.
