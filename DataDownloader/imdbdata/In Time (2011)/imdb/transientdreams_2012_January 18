Damn fine little movie that gives a new perspective on currency and
trade. It keeps a decent tension throughout while offering slightly
more than an above par &#x27;B&#x27;+ movie, yet with added twists that pervade
the film. Damned original in how it approaches the subject of universal
exchange and certainly well executed from a cinematic perspective. Much
as I don&#x27;t care for Justin Timberlake, he always impresses me in film.
It&#x27;s truly an emotional ride in many ways by way of an improbable
future, &#x27;Logan&#x27;s Run&#x27; being an obvious inspiration to this visage. I do
recommend it for its ease of delivery and entertainment, as well as the
current, socio-reality aspects alone.
