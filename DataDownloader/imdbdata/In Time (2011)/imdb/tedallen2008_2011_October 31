In a time when time is money and you can literally pay with your life,
murder is rampant, death common by theft of time and life truly day to
day and hour to hour and .. If you have the guts to take life to the
second, you could win eons. But, the real question of life is how much
are you willing to give to the ones you truly love? This is a true
Robinhood adventure and only time will tell whether or not anyone
really ever wins. The cars are the only draw back for me. I know cars
pretty good and old 1968 Camaros and Lincolns don&#x27;t quite do the movie
justice. The acting is beyond phenomenal. Olivia was truly the perfect
25 year old mother to a 25 year old Justin. Even the oldest Time Barron
was depicted as just that but 25 years old, worth millenniums.
Excellent, by far the best movie I&#x27;ve seen this year.
