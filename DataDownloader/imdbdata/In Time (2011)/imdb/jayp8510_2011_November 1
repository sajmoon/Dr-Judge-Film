2011_November 1 
OK, so I had high hopes for this movie. I saw the trailer and as a
closet socialist loved the clear underlying theme of the rich having to
keep many people down in order to maintain their power. So as I sat
down in the theatre I was hoping that even if the movie wasn&#x27;t up to
scratch at least the underlying message would make it all worth while. <br /><br />But from the very beginning there are so many flaws with this movie
that I could not bring myself to enjoy it. The concept itself is so
flawed that I could not bring myself to see past it. <br /><br />The idea is that in the society of the future (which looks strangely
like today but with slightly modified cars) there has been a
breakthrough in medical science that stops people aging at 25. This is
somehow achieved with the price tag that everybody must have a time
display on their arm that counts ever down to zero. When you get there,
you die. An interesting idea which brings up many good questions such
as &#x22;is time rationed or is it being hoarded by the authorities?&#x22;. Sadly
these questions are lightly glossed over rather than any in depth
exploration. <br /><br />JT is a character in the ghetto and lives his life permanently &#x22;broke&#x22;.
This means he rarely has more than a day or two of life left. And here
we come to the first major flaw of the concept. Everybody around JT is
the same. They all have almost no life, &#x22;in the bank&#x22;, all the time.
And yet these people walk around casually drinking coffee (costs 4
minutes) and drinking in bars (also costs time) when they are just
hours from death. Thinking about this for even a second it becomes
clear that people this close to kicking it would be doing anything in
their power to try and get more minutes. There would be no semblance of
society as any body who was prepared to steal time off others would,
and very quickly they would be the only people left alive. JT casually
gives time to a girl on the street, a very nice gesture to be sure,
however completely unrealistic given that at the time he had less than
a day to live. Its all very well to give away money when you are broke
but to give away time when you are about to die, that is a very
different story. People this close to the edge all the time would act
very differently from you and me, something this film does nothing to
explore. <br /><br />There are many many more flaws in this film but I won&#x27;t go on about
them. But the thing that finally tipped it for me was when they started
trying to expand on the commentary of the capitalist system in the US
by having outlets that lent time to the poor people in the ghetto for
extortionate interest. These are the same people that seem to
constantly have less than a day of life to their name. Once again this
does not stand up to any real scrutiny. There is no way that a person
who has allowed themselves to get down to less than a day of life is
going to have any assets. If I was going to be dead in a day I am
definitely selling my TV to try and get more time. I am certainly not
likely to have anything that a loan shark considers capital enough to
back a loan. <br /><br />But enough of my whinging. In the end because this movie could have
been so good I couldn&#x27;t enjoy the aspects that where well done. I have
focused on the story flaws because they are what annoyed me the most. I
am prepared to look past JT&#x27;s bad acting, I am prepared to look past
the fact that the future looks just like the present but with cars that
have slightly strange lights, I am prepared to look past all the poorly
thought out and completely unnecessary action scenes and I am prepared
to look past whatever was going on in that hand of poker. But in the
end this movie is flawed from the very beginning when the society they
create could never exist due to basic human nature. Very few people
would ever allow themselves to be just days from death when so many
opportunities exist around them to gain by taking advantage of others.
This movie had so many interesting areas it could have explored but in
the end it is just disappointing. <br /><br />In the end if you are prepared to look past these things and you just
want to see JT without his shirt drive round in a damn sexy old school
E type jag and just generally be cool then you will probably enjoy this
one. However if you are like me and have trouble ignoring the big holes
in the basic concept and can&#x27;t watch such an interesting idea be
butchered then best to save the time this movie will take for something
else.
