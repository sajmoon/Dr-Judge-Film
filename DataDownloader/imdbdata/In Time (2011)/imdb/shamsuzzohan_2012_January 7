The dumbest science fiction ever. The story line tried to replace money
with the time. Everyone has an allocated amount of time for their
living. They can earn, lend or borrow times from and to others. That is
the whole idea of the film. The second half of the film tried to
develop a concept of digital robin hood. However, the idea that totally
failed in this film is that the time transaction cannot be compared
with that of the money. Because, in real life, money is being safely
protected everywhere but in this film, anyone could have stolen money
from others without any effort. Bank robbery was so easy that just one
truck could have broken a whole bank vault and stolen all the money
kept. The core sci-fi base of this film along with the concept of
establishing a robin hood are total failures. Except Amanda Seyfried,
everyone was pathetic in their acting. Nevertheless, I have written
here about my opinion, hope mass viewers will like the film as a whole.
