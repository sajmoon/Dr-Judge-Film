This movie owes a more than a small nod to &#x22;Logan&#x27;s Run&#x22;. It may point
the way towards a solution to the exponential population explosion that
we are currently witnessing globally. Over the centuries, there have
been many disasters, natural or man-made, that have culled world
populations, the most recent being WWII. However, disease control and
good health services tend to legislate against another plague and,
despite the current situation across the Middle-East, it seems unlikely
that a catastrophic world conflict will break out in the foreseeable
future.<br /><br />The premise of &#x22;In Time&#x22; and indeed &#x22;Logan&#x27;s Run&#x22; is at once both
interesting and terrifying. Let&#x27;s hope that our so-called &#x22;governments&#x22;
don&#x27;t start to get ideas!
