Well, I&#x27;ve read a few movie reviews, but I don&#x27;t think that people
understood what the director wanted to achieve with this one.<br /><br />Clearly, it&#x27;s hard to see the inequality of the world (in money, life
quality, resources etc.) if you&#x27;re born in the USA with a silver spoon,
but the Occupy Wall Street movement to be anything significant.<br /><br />The rest of the World got the point of the movie.<br /><br />In order for people in the USA to more clearly understand this growing
issue, Niccoll had to put in a lot of young, beautiful and famous
people, and make the dialogs very simple so that the Americans could
get the point.<br /><br />Not trying to offend anyone living in the States who don&#x27;t think this
refers to them, you surely know who you are.<br /><br />So, kick back, enjoy the gun chasing and sexy scenes with Justin
Timberlake, and then talk about the very core of the plot with other
people, and see what ideas will come out of your or their heads.<br /><br />I&#x27;ve rated it 9 out of 10, it&#x27;s higher that I&#x27;d usually rate it, but
it&#x27;s gotten pretty low grades, and it would be too bad if people didn&#x27;t
get to see it just because of that. <br /><br />If you spared time to watch a useless Twilight saga, then you can
really watch this movie, it will be worth your time.
