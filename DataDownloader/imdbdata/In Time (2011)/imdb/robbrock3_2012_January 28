Due to a bit of a dearth of sci-fi releases around the release of &#x27;In
Time&#x27;, I think it will unfortunately be labelled a sci-fi flick that
never held down enough sci-fi to grip fans of the genre. It&#x27;s in the
future, yes, and it creates a new concept for humanity, but I would
only put it on the sci-fi shelf along with Equilibrium, Minority Report
etc. A near-future, &#x22;wouldn&#x27;t it be terrible if...&#x22; kind of a setting.<br /><br />The main draw of the movie is its concept. That of perfected
capitalism, where money has been done away with and instead people are
faced with the choice of living long but frugal lives, or living to the
full and dying very young.<br /><br />The result is plausibly shown as somewhere in the middle, and whilst
the true capitalist fat cats at the top are basically immortal, the
majority get by from day to day, month to month, as we do anyway in our
time.<br /><br />What I like about In Time is how it sticks to its concept and really
explores it. I thought I had grasped the idea early on and thought &#x27;ok
got it, now get on with the movie&#x27; - but what it does is constantly
throw up new ways in which this system might affect your life, and
(hopefully) in ways you hadn&#x27;t thought of.<br /><br />Timberlake has proved himself an actor in this movie, and I was
pleasantly surprised by that. Seyfried is also very likable in her role
and plays the part well. Cillian Murphy is again excellent, and I would
love for a director to hire him in a really challenging lead part so we
can see his true potential.<br /><br />Overall, In Time covers a lot of bases, different audiences will take
different things from it. Some futuristic shenanigans, some relieving
fast-paced action scenes, some tense set-ups and a good idea that runs
through all of it. The plot might not grip you for the duration but at
least it never goes totally AWOL.<br /><br />7/10 and well worth a watch.
