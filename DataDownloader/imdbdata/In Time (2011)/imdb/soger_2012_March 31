I read some reviews and it seems to me that the people who like this
movie are the ones that actually understand that this movie is not a
sci-fi but a real life description dressed as a sci-fi.<br /><br />In many ways the movie is similar to Eagle Eye although it addresses a
different issue. Eagle Eye talks about the problems with the
politicians and the government while this movie is all about the
problems with banks, inflation, money in general. Eagle Eye is also
more subtle while this movie is a direct reflection of our current
society in a futuristic sci-fi mirror. To say only one example: people
die on the street because they &#x22;time out&#x22;. Well, of course we don&#x27;t
have clocks built into our arms but people do die on the street because
they have nothing to eat or they freeze to death etc. If you did not
see this parallelism it&#x27;s probably because you wanted some mindless
entertainment with plasma rifles or something.<br /><br />So people, read between the lines.
