This movie is exactly like &#x22;The Price of Life&#x22;<br /><br />description of &#x22;The Price of Life&#x22;: The hours of your life as a
currency you can buy or sell, trade or squander.<br /><br />Director: Stephen Tolkin Writers: Stephen Tolkin (screenplay), Stephen
Tolkin (story), and 1 more credit &#xBB; Stars: Dana Andersen, Diana Bellamy
and Roy Brocksmith<br /><br />The problem I have with this movie is they did not add much originality
to the previous movie that was invented, and in my opinion, not as well
done. The only real difference is that there is a direct antagonist in
the movie &#x22;In Time&#x22; where the antagonist is the &#x22;old ones&#x22; in &#x22;The
price of Life&#x22;<br /><br />I liked both movies, but I would have liked to see some more building
of the concept of &#x22;time and money&#x22; relationships and character meaning,
where as the previous movie in 1987 does a better job of that.
