It is a paradox that blockbuster American movies are so well made in
terms of acting, directing, editing and overall resources, but they
often suck where it matters most: the script! This is one of those
unfortunate cases where an intriguing idea is utterly destroyed by a
childish story.<br /><br />Imagine Bonnie and Clyde in an overly capitalistic world that looks a
lot like Equilibrium. People are immortal, biologically frozen at 25
years, but they have this ridiculous green glowing clock on their arms,
counting down to a moment when they die. They use time as a currency,
earning it, stealing it, buying with it. A very interesting concept, an
abstractisation of reality. But they botch it up!<br /><br />A society that can genetically engineer humans with a glowing clock on
their hands can also insure some cryptographic safety in the mechanism,
so that people don&#x27;t steal it away. The cars sound electric, but they
are normal looking. People work in factories doing meaningless tasks,
computers seem to do only voices and almost anything can be done with a
single gun and a bit of determination. It makes no sense.<br /><br />Some of the scenes are so bad that it makes teeth ache. Such an
interesting idea and such a poor job implementing it. This is barely a
6 movie and I was very close to a 5. One should avoid it.
