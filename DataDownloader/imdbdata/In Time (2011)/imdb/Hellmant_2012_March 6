&#x27;IN TIME&#x27;: Three Stars (Out of Five) <br /><br />A futuristic dystopian science fiction film that starts out with a
great premise but loses all of it&#x27;s creativity and originality to
routine by the numbers action scenes. It&#x27;s written and directed by
Andrew Niccol, who also helmed the similar themed &#x27;GATTACA&#x27; which was
quite good. Niccol also wrote &#x27;THE TRUMAN SHOW&#x27; which was a very good
film as well so it&#x27;s a little surprising that he handled this one so
ham-handedly. The film stars Justin Timberlake, Amanda Seyfried and
Cillian Murphy and Murphy is the only one who brings anything to the
table. The film as a whole is very clunky and disappointing.<br /><br />It&#x27;s set in a world where people stop aging at 25 and will die a year
later if they don&#x27;t earn enough currency to prolong their lives. Time
is traded as money and the rich live as immortals while the poor scrape
by what ever they can just to make it another day. Your remaining time
is worn on your arm, in a digital readout, and scanned to pay all
monetary transactions. Prices and taxes are raised all the time without
warning in order to keep the weak majority at bay. Timberlake plays
Will Salas, who lives with his mother (Olivia Wilde) in the ghettos and
never has a full day&#x27;s worth of hours. One night he helps a rich man,
Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer), from being mugged and killed in a bar by
gangsters known as the Minutemen. Hamiltion repays Salas by giving him
all his remaining time, 116 years before committing suicide. He passes
on some words of wisdom and lets Will know that everyone could and
should live a happy natural life and then die. Will is then suspected
of murdering Hamilton and goes on the run with a millionaire&#x27;s
daughter, Sylvia (Seyfried), he meets while flaunting his new money.
The two begin robbing from the rich and giving to the poor while trying
to disrupt the system and avoiding the Timekeeper (Murphy), who polices
time.<br /><br />The idea behind the film is the perfect social commentary and is
especially relevant to our times and modern economy. Life in the film
isn&#x27;t really that much different from modern reality. It&#x27;s a shame that
such a great idea was wasted though. It could have been the perfect
Philip K. Dick type sci-fi film and instead we get a weak action film
starring Justin Timberlake! His casting was the first way the movie
went wrong but there&#x27;s a lot more at fault to it than just that. Every
word of dialogue seems forced and every scene seems like nothing more
than the plot and action formula just pushing itself forward. There&#x27;s
no heart or character to it at all. Most of all the film is just
disappointing, considering all it had going for it.<br /><br />Watch our movie review show &#x27;MOVIE TALK&#x27; at:
