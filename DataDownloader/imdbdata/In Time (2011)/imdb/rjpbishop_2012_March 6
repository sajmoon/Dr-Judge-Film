I must admit, I was a little apprehensive when I saw that Timberlake
was starring in this. <br /><br />However, I was really impressed with the film, it intrigued me and the
plot was actually plausible, it kept me interested throughout, edgy,
gritty in places a good cast and superb acting, except for the British
guy, shame.<br /><br />Timberlake played a convincing character with conviction, really
enjoyable.<br /><br />I&#x27;d recommend this film to anyone, the ending was pretty cool as well,
almost like there was so <br /><br />other way it should end and not many films these days accomplish that!!
