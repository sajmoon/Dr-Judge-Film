Aping the opening of Manhattan, with a number of street-level shots of
Paris cut to European traditional jazz sets this film apart - slightly
- in Woody Allen&#x27;s oeuvre. It certainly sits apart from the recentfilms
which are a bit aimless. This is funnier and more purposeful. A lot of
this is to do with Allen substituting Owen Wilson for himself as the
romantic, or rather impetuous writer lead, Gil. Wilson adopts the same
charming, untidy stream-of-consciousness approach as his character&#x27;s-
sake, breezing past the pedantry of his peers and the tunnel-visioned
Gallophobia of his in-laws-to-be.<br /><br />It also means that we can accept the sci-fi/magic realism of the second
and third acts of the film, post midnight time-travelling, without much
mental trauma. If I had one criticism of the film its that it pays
Wilson too much attention and doesn&#x27;t quite pay its respects to the
capital (specifically the 1920s) as it might. Still it is a lovely,
coherent film, wearing its philosophy lightly for charm&#x27;s sake. It
works a treat. 6/10
