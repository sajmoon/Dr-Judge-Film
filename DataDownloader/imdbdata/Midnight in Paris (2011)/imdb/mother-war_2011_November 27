2011_November 27 
There could be different reasons why this movie made me cry - the first
reason- the collaboration between my favorite movie director and my
favorite actress ( Marion Cotillard ). The second reason - that I am
completely in love with Paris and magical 90 minutes in it are all I
could ask for right now. The third reason - as a writer, I really felt
Owen&#x27;s character close. The fourth reason - every.single.quote from
this movie. Woody Allen is more than a director - he&#x27;s an artist,
lover, Parisian, etc. The fifth reason - the plot was absolutely
perfect. Beautiful. Extraordinary. I could go on, you know... So, one
of these could be the reason why this movie made my cry, but I guess
the truth is that the symbiosis between all of the reasons makes this
movie the best 2011&#x27; film in my personal chart.
