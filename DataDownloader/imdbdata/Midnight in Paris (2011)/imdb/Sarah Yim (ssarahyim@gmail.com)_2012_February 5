The title speaks for itself. Midnight in Paris (2011) discovers Paris
through a man&#x27;s troubles, not the other way around.<br /><br />The plot is original and the message around the theme of &#x22;nostalgia&#x22; is
delivered clearly. Nevertheless, it is disappointing that the movie
itself isn&#x27;t particularly exciting - no mystery or suspense, no moments
of intensity, and no obvious comedy. Thankfully, the beautiful setting
and gorgeous music make up for the shortcomings. (Even as I am writing
this review, I am listening to the soundtrack.)<br /><br />I think most people watch for the visual and auditory appeal; the movie
isn&#x27;t a head-scratcher or a shock.
