One of Woody Allen&#x27;s best. <br /><br />An ostensibly simple tale of an engaged American couple (Owen Wilson
and Rachel McMadams) holidaying in Paris with her parents. Of course,
they are unsuited. Of course, Wilson&#x27;s character is a writer. He would
like nothing better than to retreat into another world, another time,
and maybe to live in Paris. Cinderella-like, at the stroke of twelve
each night he finds what he is looking for in an imaginative,
Spielberg-esque way. <br /><br />This is a clever allegory into the essence of dissatisfaction, and
Allen does not hesitate to name-drop (and character-drop) in the most
delightful way throughout the film. <br /><br />Michael Sheen is good as the professor you love to hate, the
know-it-all to whom Owen&#x27;s fianc&#xE9;e appears very much in thrall. <br /><br />One of Owen Wilson&#x27;s best performances in any film, this shows his
softer more human side. And watch out for a superb cameo appearance by
Adrien Brody...the word &#x27;rhinoceros&#x27; will never sound the same ever
again. <br /><br />Simply outstanding. I didn&#x27;t actually want the film to end. <br /><br />Nine stars.
