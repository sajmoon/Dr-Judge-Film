I really don&#x27;t get the hype with Woody Allen. I really do feel that
it&#x27;s a case of &#x22; The Emperors New Clothes&#x22; with his films. Actors and
critics alike fall over backwards to praise his work yet i find it all
very bland.<br /><br />Midnight in Paris is an odd film about a writer who , while on vacation
in Paris with his wife to be, finds a way to go back in time to meet
famous artists , writers and musicians and he soon realises that this
world is far better than the one he currently lives in.<br /><br />As is any Woody Allen movie , Midnight in Paris is very dialogue
orientated , and i have no problem with that but what i don&#x27;t like is
the pretentiousness of it. Allen presumes the audience is aware of the
characters on show and their history and that everyone is in love with
their work. It&#x27;s not the case with me. Owen Wilson is irritating ( as
usual) as is the totally unbelievable Rachel McAdams. You never get the
feeling that these are a real couple. <br /><br />This film is not terrible , just boring and that really is not a trait
i want in a film
