This movie is great, begging to end. It&#x27;s an original movie, it has
themes like: Golden age thinking, denial and the real definition of
success, which is not happiness.<br /><br />The cast is so wonderful. You would like to kill Rachel McAdams, or at
least scream at her. Marion Cotillard is such a wonderful muse, Owen
Wilson plays the lost dreamer perfectly and the 20&#x27;s characters are so
good too, they not only look like their parts but also act it very
well. I saw an interview with Corey Stoll (Hemingway) and he said it
was hard to play the confident macho surrounded by winning Oscar
actresses. At least, he fooled me. I thought he was confidence
personified.<br /><br />I read some reviews that said it wasn&#x27;t funny. The only explanation I
can give to that is the fact that it is a nerd movie. If you don&#x27;t know
who is Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Picasso and Dal&#xED;, don&#x27;t watch it. It is
impossible to relate to Gil (Owen Wilson) if you don&#x27;t get the
greatness of the people he is meeting. The first time I saw it I felt I
was going to faint if I found Hemingway in a bar, and he is not even my
favorite author, or how practical it would be to have surrealists as
confidants. To really enjoy this movie, you need some background. I
didn&#x27;t know everyone, but the main characters of the 20&#x27;s.<br /><br />Another warning, don&#x27;t expect the Hollywood ending.
