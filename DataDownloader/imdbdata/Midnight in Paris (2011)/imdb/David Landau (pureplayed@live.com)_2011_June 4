&#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; is the best Woody Allen film I know, by several
miles. The night before seeing it I happened to see another of Woody&#x27;s
films, &#x22;Deconstructing Harry,&#x22; and the proximity was convenient for
telling the difference. &#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; is based on an act of
imagination, with Allen&#x27;s quirky humor placed at the service of it.
&#x22;Deconstructing Harry,&#x22; like pretty much everything else Allen has
made, is a long string of one-liners inspired by Woody&#x27;s
self-regarding. It seems that Woody has finally learned to take himself
out of the frame and to create a structure that gives something of
value to the viewer. <br /><br />Is it a great film? Let&#x27;s see how it plays in the memory. I knew I was
hooked when I felt the wonder experienced by Owen Wilson&#x27;s character.
That moment breathes authentically; and Woody&#x27;s persona is nowhere
near. The film has its share of flaws but many more beauties. I
especially respect the film for ending at precisely the place it
should. How many of today&#x27;s films or fictions can make that claim, or
would bother to?
