What a coincidence: two of the films nominated for the 2012 Academy
Awards Best Picture award--The Artist and Midnight in Paris--are
magic-realism tributes from France to America and vice versa. The
Artist does this elegantly, with a brilliantly original take on the
classic riches-to-rags-to-riches redemption motif. Ironically, while
fawning over Paris, Woody Allen had to spoil his movie by larding it
with clich&#xE9;s about superficial, materialistic Californians. While The
Artist was a pure and innocent celebration of Hollywood, Woody Allen is
a typical young American effacing himself before superior European
sophistication. Really quite sad, because the premise was clever, and
charmingly carried out during those segments when the hero was
soir&#xE9;eing with historical cultural greats. I also love Paris, and also
suffer the recurring fantasy of just simply...staying, maybe to write
my book. My experience has been that haughty Parisians really are
disarmed by Jerry Lewis-like Americans like me and Owen Wilson. ;) Call
me another self-effacing young American, but a French director could
have pulled off Midnight in Paris with grace and subtle humor while
retaining his dignity. Irony noted.
