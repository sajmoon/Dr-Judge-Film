Most certainly, &#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; DID blow me away because Woody
Allen&#x27;s a proved genius; Owen Wilson is far better than the kook seen
in his other films; the melodies &#x22;Si tu vois ma m&#xE8;re&#x22; and &#x22;Bistro Fada&#x22;
were haunting and the entire story line was so unique and mesmerizing,
I&#x27;ll see it again next week. Even though we are close to four months
away from Jan.1st, this mid-summer release will win for Mr. Allen
either or both the Best Director of the Year and Best Original Screen
Play Not Based on a Book. Are you a nostalgiaphile as I am? If so,
you&#x27;ll go ape over this movie--totally bonkers by the way Mr. Allen
weaved the past into the present and it happens so unexpectedly, the
viewer is taken by storm and held until the end. Its the best picture
I&#x27;ve seen thus far in &#x27;11 and say it&#x27;s one of the best, if not the best
film Allen&#x27;s ever done. And let&#x27;s not forget about &#x22;Match Point&#x22;
either. The film is a pleasantly eerie fantasy adventure into a new-old
dimension that&#x27;s whimsical and far better than clever. An absolute
DON&#x27;T MISS.
