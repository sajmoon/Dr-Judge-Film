For anyone who has romance in his/ her soul then you want to see this
film. The casting is very good and Owen Wilson makes for a very
engaging lead character. The scenes after Midnight are a delight and
there are stand-out performances, particularly Adrien Brody as Salvador
Dali. Paris is made to look like a place you would long to be in,
ignoring the horrendous traffic. There are some great one-liners and
casual asides - watch out for the riff on Matisse. It is always said
that if a film seems to pass quickly, its a hallmark of a good,
engrossing film. This one seemed to last for an instant and yet lasted
in the memory for hours. Woody has rediscovered his mojo in Paris and
the after Midnight club is the best place to be.
