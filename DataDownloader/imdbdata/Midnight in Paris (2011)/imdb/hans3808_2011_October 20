I had not particularly looked forward to this film as I am no fan of
Owen and especially not in a romantic comedy as I thinks he is not
suitable for comedy or romance. But that&#x27;s my view, I&#x27;m elderly and
grew up with Woody Allen so I&#x27;m biased. To make this film a much
greater success Woody should have found a guy of similar build and
personality like himself. I loved the music and the settings, the
general conversation and I ask myself, once Woody Allen is gone what is
left to enjoy.Woody is the only one who can make an everyday comedy
stand out and it&#x27;s sheer lunacy that he has not been showered with
Oscars, the guy is a genius. So go and enjoy this latest masterpiece by
the one and only Woody Allen.
