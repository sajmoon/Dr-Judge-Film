Woody Allen takes Paris and bathes it within its own glory all the
while making one of his most entertaining films in decades. Great
cinematography, classic music, french food, french culture and Allen&#x27;s
trademark humor are pure magic. You may see some of the familiar
character types from other films, but they only add to the mixture. Odd
man out is Owen Wilson, but somehow he sheds his B-movie past and
encompasses the Woody Allen humor without mimicking Allen. The
ever-evolving plot twists will have you laughing as well as entranced.
This is the first Allen film (in a long time) where he doesn&#x27;t
pontificate about life and death, but only celebrates the present while
ironically, living in two eras. This is beyond Oscar material.
