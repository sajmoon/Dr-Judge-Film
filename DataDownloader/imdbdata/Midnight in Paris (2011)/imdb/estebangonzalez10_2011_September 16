&#xA8;That Paris exists and anyone could choose to live anywhere else in the
world will always be a mystery to me.&#xA8; Woody Allen has directed more
than 40 films in over four decades and I can honestly say that his last
film is one of my favorites. If you think otherwise then you are just
probably living in nostalgia and trying to remember the past as being
much better than the present. Like Micheal Sheen&#x27;s character would say:
&#xA8;Nostalgia is denial - denial of the painful present&#x85;the name for this
denial is Golden Age thinking &#x96; the erroneous notion that a different
time period is better than the one ones living in.&#xA8; Woody Allen has
directed numerous great films and this is one of them that will be
remembered nostalgically in years to come. It is not a romantic film as
we are used to seeing, it is more of a nostalgic film; the true romance
isn&#x27;t between Wilson and McAdams, but between Wilson and Paris, between
Wilson and art. The romance is in the city, in the art, in the past.
The central theme of this film is clear: nostalgia. Woody Allen manages
to deal with these issues in a very comedic way and the dialogue and
story is just great. Midnight in Paris is a very funny and nostalgic
film. The city of Paris may have never looked as great as it does in
this movie. The characters are memorable and it is interesting how
Allen intertwines the present with the past and makes fun of some of
the stereotypes these artists have. I had a great time with Midnight in
Paris; Woody Allen has done it again! Gil (Owen Wilson) and Inez
(Rachel McAdams) are an American engaged couple who are visiting Paris
with Inez&#x27;s parents, John (Kurt Fuller) and Helen (Mimi Kennedy). Gil
instantly falls in love with the city and the rich story it has to
tell, while Inez on the other hand doesn&#x27;t like Paris that much. Gil
insists they should move to Paris once they get married, but Inez would
rather stay in Beverly Hills where Gil has had success writing scripts
for Hollywood films. Gil is unhappy with his Hollywood life and has
decided to try his luck on writing a novel. Inez insists he should
stick to what he does best. In Paris, Inez runs into some friends: Paul
(Michael Sheen) and Carol (Nina Arianda). Paul is a very pedantic sort
of guy who always has an opinion on everything and is showing off his
great knowledge. Gil can&#x27;t stand him, but Inez insists on hanging out
with him and his wife Carol, and asks Paul to critique Gil&#x27;s novel for
him. One night the couples decide to go out and dance, but Gil says
he&#x27;s too tired and decides to head back to the hotel on his own. While
wondering the streets of Paris the clock strikes midnight and a group
of French partygoers invite Gil to a party. In this party, Gil runs
into Zelda (Alison Pill) and Scott Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston), and
Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll). Gil realizes that somehow he has
travelled to 1920 and is meeting all these artists who he&#x27;s admired all
his life; he&#x27;s in the decade he considers as being the Golden Age.
Ernest tells Gil that he can get Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) to
proofread his novel for him; but when Gil goes to get his novel he is
back in 2010. Gil realizes that he can only travel back in time when
the clock strikes midnight, so the adventure begins every night where
he meets interesting people like Picasso (Marcial Di Fonzo) and his
mistress Adriana (Marion Cotillard) who he falls for, and other great
artists such as Salvador Dali (Adrien Brody) and Luis Bu&#xF1;uel (Adrien de
Van), among others.<br /><br />The true heart of the film relies on Owen Wilson&#x27;s performance. He is
great in this movie and reminded me a lot of the younger Woody Allen
who used to star in his own movies. The funniest moments of the film
have to do with these stereotypes that these great artists of the past
have been given. Adrien Brody is great as Salvador Dali, and the
rhinoceros scene is extremely funny; Corey Stoll is equally great
playing the courageous Ernest Hemingway. His dialogue with Wilson&#x27;s
character about love and death is powerful and funny at the same time.
Marion Cotillard and Owen Wilson also had great chemistry together and
it was fun to watch them on screen. McAdams is one of my favorite
actresses, and this time she plays sort of the villain, instead of the
sweet role she is used to playing. This is a much different role from
the one Wilson and McAdams played in Wedding Crashers. Midnight in
Paris is just a terrific movie, with a lot of heart, and Woody Allen
proves once again that he is a great director and writer. I absolutely
recommend this movie as one of the best the year has had to offer.<br /><br />http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/
