We felt like driving to the airport to get a flight to Paris after
seeing this gorgeous, funny and poignant film. For Woody Allen fans
there are numerous characters, scenes and lines that relate to his body
of work. However, he puts them together with a fresh approach, and Owen
Wilson is surprisingly perfect as the conflicted first time novelist.<br /><br />In fact, ALL the cast are just spot-on perfect in their roles, and the
sets and costumes are fantastic. It&#x27;s doubtful that a &#x27;small&#x27; movie
like this will get Academy consideration, but it should at least for
the costumes and set design. The main plot line dictates a LOT of
demands on these crafts.<br /><br />I urge you to see this movie on the big screen to drink in the full
body of Woody Allen&#x27;s vision.
