Woody Allen&#x27;s &#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; is a sweet and charming examination
of romance&#x97;not only romance of the heart but also romance for the past.
Owen Wilson plays Gil, a hack Hollywood screenwriter who longs to write
serious literature. He and his fianc&#xE9;e, played by Rachel McAdams, are
visiting Paris to spend some time with her parents before they get
married. Gil obviously adores Paris&#x97;as does Allen, who shoots it as
lovingly as he shoots his own beloved Manhattan&#x97;and wonders whether he
and his fianc&#xE9;e should move there permanently. As he escapes his
insufferable soon-to-be in-laws, Gil stumbles upon the Paris of the
past he has romanticized so thoroughly and encounters F. Scott and
Zelda Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Picasso, and a host of
other literary and artistic figures. He falls for the lovely Adriana,
played by Marion Cotillard, and he is ultimately forced to reconcile
his romances with his reality. Allen&#x27;s script is, as we have come to
expect, witty and insightful and intelligent, and the film itself will
win you over with its charm and its honesty.
