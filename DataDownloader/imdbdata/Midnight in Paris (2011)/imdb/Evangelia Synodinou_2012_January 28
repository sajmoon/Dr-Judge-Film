I was almost convinced that it would be just another Woody Allen&#x27;s
weird movie, but gladly i proved myself wrong. It&#x27;s a beautiful and
inspiring story about an engaged couple and their own -different-
expectations that are being exposed during a trip to Paris, France. Gil
(Owen Wilson) seems to be drawn by the beauty of this city and needs
more time to enjoy the experience while trying to finish his novel.
Inez (Rachel McAdams) doesn&#x27;t share the same enthusiasm. Between their
opposing viewpoints and quarrels Gil experiences a personal faerie
tale, through epochs where art was flourishing.<br /><br />The location itself takes you back in time. Most of the scenes where
shot at night where the Paris atmosphere is magical and nostalgic. It
slowly takes you back to the Roaring Twenties, the Golden Age -and
beyond- introducing you to some very interesting characters. In this
film i found the supporting actors performances far more interesting
than those of the protagonists. Very talented Marion Cottilard, Tom
Hiddleston, Alison Pill and, of course the lovely Kathy Bates and
Michael Sheen.<br /><br />Judging by the eras, you ought to expect a beautiful music compilation,
from 1890s Jacques Offenbach to 1920s Ben Bernies orchestra and Nat
Star. I&#x27;d give kudos to Mr. Allen for this one.
