Its Woody Allen shooting a movie about the struggles of &#x27;the artist&#x27; in
Paris. It can&#x27;t be bad, and it isn&#x27;t bad. But just how good is the
film? My answer: pretty good, but far from great.<br /><br />Allen fixates upon the city as the muse of artists both past and
present. His opening shots of Paris set the stage for the ongoing love
affair his protagonist Gill (Owen Wilson) has with the city and the
city&#x27;s rich history as fertile ground for artistic endeavor. Owen as
Gill, succeeds in playing a struggling writer who is trying to escape
his success as a Hollywood actor in cookie-cutter movies. He waxes
poetic to his fianc&#xE9;e, Inez (Rachel McAdams) about his desire to leave
Pasadena and relocate to Paris permanently. This is where Allen creates
the initial tension for our protagonist. Gill wants to walk the streets
that Fitzgerald and Hemingway and Picasso walked. He wants to be a real
artist, and he is confronted with this growing realization while trying
to plan a life with Inez, who is the rich, soulless American caricature
of Hollywood emptiness.<br /><br />On his midnight walks, Wilson delves into the Paris of the 1920s and
with each evening he is pushed away from the reality of a life with
Inez toward a life of Parisian wistful inspiration. Allen juggles some
difficult plot devices that are wholly unbelievable but nonetheless
enjoyable. To say that the 20s &#x22;come to life&#x22; for Wilson would be both
physically and psychologically accurate. All the while, his fianc&#xE9;e and
her Republican parents and snooty friends question his actions, spurn
his artistic flightiness and serve to establish the materialistic
sadness that blinds people from the sights that Gill cherishes, the
beauty and inspiration of Paris that can&#x27;t be discovered in the Museum
but, instead, must be sought out on its streets, preferably in the
rain. <br /><br />The theme of the present day artist yearning for the past glory periods
of art whether it be the 1920s or 1890s is force fed to the viewer.
Allen builds this theme up and slowly questions it as the movie drifts
onward, but in delivering a verbal and concise conclusion on the issue,
I felt he left little to the audiences imagination. <br /><br />Additionally, the conflict we want from an Allen movie, the inner
turmoil, the multiple plot line craziness, the sexual and sensual
aspects, all of these cinematic fingerprints that identify an Allen
movie are largely washed out in this film. There is a growing sense of
flow to the film that allows the viewer to know which way the wind is
blowing and how things will conclude, and when they finally do, it
makes for a nice story of art winning the day, but it lacks the
whirlwind emotions so frequently associated with a Woody Allen movie.
For literature fans, for Allen fans, and for general movie fans, its
worth a viewing, but its not a mind blowing film.
