&#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; was a massive disappointment.<br /><br />The film is full of beautiful shots of Paris and perhaps this may
distract viewers from the fact that this movie is void of any real
meaning whatsoever.<br /><br />The &#x27;story&#x27; is about a writer Gil (Owen Wilson) who wants to stay in
Paris and write. His fianc&#xE9; (Rachel McAdams) and her family are wealthy
superficial socialites. Every night, Gil &#x27;time travels&#x27; back to Paris
1920s where he meets all his artistic and literary idols. This is
little more than an exercising in name-dropping and talent-wasting. He
meets a non-superficial woman (Marion Cotillard).<br /><br />I can&#x27;t spoil the storyline because nothing happens. In what I suppose
could be called the &#x27;climax&#x27;, the character Gil himself experiences
what he describes as a &#x22;minor epiphany&#x22;. It barely even qualifies
minor. It&#x27;s meaningless.<br /><br />The &#x27;characters&#x27; are woefully under-developed, completely
two-dimensional.<br /><br />Woody himself as described his film-making style as &#x22;lazy&#x22; and I have
to say this is Woody at his laziest.
