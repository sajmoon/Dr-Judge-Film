MIP has some delightful moments but for the most part it&#x27;s a
disappointment in several ways. Woody Allen&#x27;s earlier films, notably
Love and Death (his best) were truly funny. He blended Marx Brothers
slapstick with some genuine wit and gag humor and biting satire.<br /><br />Now we have the &#x22;new&#x22; Woody, somewhat pretentious in his gray days,
trying to mine old territory -- angst, neuroses, etc. -- but failing by
not being very funny. Comedy is what reveals the human soul but here in
MIP we merely get character sketches that may look good on paper but do
not translate well to celluloid. Speaking of which, the camera Woody
used to shoot this movie was terrible, producing artificial colors and
failing to capture the charm of Paris, though he tried hard in the
opening sequence. Soft pastel, less vivid imagery would have worked so
much better.<br /><br />Further, Woody badly misses the mark by pining for a &#x22;Golden Age&#x22; that
was mediocre at best. Hemingway, Fitzgerald, et. al. were all
second-raters (even Hemingway wrote bad Hemingway and is parodied to
this day, which denotes his second-tier status). The 1920&#x27;s may have
been the gilded age in terms of wealth but when it comes to art, Woody
was off by at least 30 years and might have found more inspiration from
the Victorian Era and 19th Century when the true greats of literature
and the other arts -- i.e., Dickens, Hardy, Eliot, Beethoven, Verdi,
Goethe to name but a few -- stood well above anyone who lived and
worked in the 20th Century.<br /><br />As for the lead, Owen Wilson is all wrong for the part, but it&#x27;s not
his fault. Woody reworked the script to flesh out Wilson&#x27;s character
and therein lies in the problem. In his earlier films, Woody played the
protagonist as financially struggling, angst- and guilt-ridden, a
neurotic nebbish who knows that 2+2=4 but nonetheless worries about it
constantly. Here, Wilson is rich, has rich would-be relatives and
therefore has no money or status concerns. He&#x27;s just a romantic,
WASPish, hardly sympathetic or interesting, and he does not invite
empathy. We don&#x27;t really care about him like we did with Woody&#x27;s
earlier main characters who tried to come to grips with &#x22;the meaning of
life.&#x22; As for the other characters, they come off more like caricatures
rather than real people. Hemingway is played strictly as parody
(perhaps there is no other way to play him), and the Fitzgeralds were
neither interesting nor likable. Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) is
largely wasted.<br /><br />Woody won an Oscar for a screenplay that was occasionally witty and
clever but wit and cleverness are not enough. What was needed was more
whimsy, drollery and belly laughs. MIP instead pokes you in the ribs
now and then but not enough to elicit more than a smile now and then.
