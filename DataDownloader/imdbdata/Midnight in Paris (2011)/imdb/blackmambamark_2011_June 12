Something very surprising about Woody Allen films is that you never
even know when they&#x27;re released......let alone even know he&#x27;s directing
them. The past three Woody Allen movies i have seen have all been
great, and it strikes me as odd to see that his movies are not highly
publicized. I mean, the guy has been directing movies for almost 30
years now. You would figure that his movies would be everywhere.<br /><br />Once again, Woody Allen has impressed the hell out of me. He does such
an amazing job of taking something so simplistic, and making it
beautiful and extraordinary. The main character Gil, played by Owen
Wilson (who i normally hate, but actually liked in this movie), is a
struggling writer who walks the streets of Paris at night, and is
somehow thrown back in time each night and has chance encounters with
some of the most notable artist and writers of that time period. I know
it may sound somewhat bazaar, but Allen sells it in the most
entertaining fashion.<br /><br />Confronting Dali, Hemmingway, Picaso, Scott Fitzgerald, T.S.
Elliot.....these are all people who appreciate the arts dream of
conversing with. Allen knows this, and creates this romantic yet
humorous cloud around each of these chance encounters. If you have any
appreciation for the arts or fine literature, you will love the set-up
of this movie.<br /><br />As far as acting, it&#x27;s pretty damn good. I know earlier i said how i
normally hate Owen Wilson but i loved him this picture. But the real
bread winner in this movie is Marion Cotillard. In the past, Woody has
always done a fine job of making his lead female &#x27;oh so&#x27; very seductive
and erotic. The writing for her character is there......but Marion took
it and did something truly incredible with it. Every frame she was in
made my mouth fall flat to the floor. The way she spoke and the way she
evoked emotion with her eyes......it was almost too much for me to
handle. Im my opinion, she is the front runner for best actress so far
this year.<br /><br />Bottom Line.....it was a very enjoyable piece of work. One of the best
i have seen so far this year. Since this movie wasn&#x27;t heavily
publicized, it felt like discovering a little gem that not everyone
knows about, and it makes it a little more fun. And in the long run, i
think that&#x27;s why Woody doesn&#x27;t go for the main stream theater.....he
goes for the romance of watching a movie. And this movie definitely
proves that point.
