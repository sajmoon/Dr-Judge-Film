With some films in you, you should probably now by now how to handle
Woody Allen, what is or isn&#x27;t worth your time; the visual imagination,
beautiful or borrowed; the snarky wit, acerbic or whinging; the nervous
tics and anxieties, relatable or complacent.<br /><br />I happen to not be attuned at all with him, and have only moderately
enjoyed a few films a long time ago. He looks up to Bergman, I am an
Antonioni person. So I will always resolve in favor of cessation,
concentrated mind, detached perception, and the idea that the content
of the mind does not matter one bit - which both him and Bergman
anxiously probed about - so long as we get to understand the mechanisms
that give rise to it and give rise to images. With an eye on an
awareness that liberates.<br /><br />Here we have one such film about internal mind, and in a form that
appeals to me; the look from inside the mirror, in an effort to give us
actual in-sight of the mind weaving stories.<br /><br />For this to work, we need to be able to make concessions. We also need
to be nostalgic for the golden afterglow to warm us. We need to be
willing to be transported to where not everything makes sense. We need
to give in a little to the fantasy as though it was our own.<br /><br />So for most of the film we get to wander around a dreamy 1920&#x27;s Paris
all in an effort to apprehend the circumstances that would provide
inspiration and strength to overcome insecurities back in the waking
world. Back where an airheaded blonde wife waits for us to have dinner
in the fancy restaurant, the disapproving parents, the suave sexual
antagonist; a cast of shrill stereotypes out of a Woody Allen film.<br /><br />The lesson that we fish inside the fantasy is the expected, the only
one that can be valuable. It is a dangerous chimera to indulge the
mind; now matters, there was never any other world, any world more
beautiful.<br /><br />But it does remain on the whole a film where the fantasy is a
superficial romp, with the important realization merely tucked at the
end of a good time. As it turns out, there was nothing in the bottoms
of this mind that is a shadow from the surface, or a particularly deep
encounter, beyond of course getting to meet the woman of one&#x27;s dreams.
How poignant it would have been for example, if the anxieties above
were recast inside the fantasy in forms that we know from movies? What
Lynch has done so ingeniusly. There is none of that here, just the love
letter already stamped.<br /><br />In the middle of so much art and so many encounters with the people who
made it, the greatest art however remains this city of lights. It is
truly a cinematic jewel, and Woody&#x27;s virtual wandering is the best
thing next to living in it.<br /><br />If the premise here appeals to you, I recommend that you seek out films
by the filmmakers who inherited surrealism as the means to re-invent
cinema. The journey from that short with the sliced eye from the period
referenced here that Bunuel did with Dali to Welles who parodied that
stuff at the time but used that eye to slice narrative, to how Raoul
Ruiz transfigured Welles. Start with Ruiz, who recently passed away.
Woody&#x27;s film is breezy but decorative.
