While I&#x27;ve caught most of Woody&#x27;s last few films on NetFlix (I think
the last one I saw in the theater was Match Point), I wanted to make
sure to see Midnight in Paris on the big screen for the full effect. I
was not disappointed -- I had tears streaming down my cheeks within the
first two minutes, feeling as if I&#x27;d been transported to beautiful
Paris for a couple of hours.<br /><br />I think this is a fine film, and it was certainly entertaining -- with
a core message that I can understand and relate to. When you&#x27;ve seen
most of Woody&#x27;s films over the years, you immediately recognize the
character &#x22;types&#x22; reappearing in slightly different situations with
other actors in the rolls. That&#x27;s a double-edged sword in that there&#x27;s
something familiar about the ebb and flow of his films, but it can also
be somewhat trite and annoying. Fortunately, that didn&#x27;t seem to bother
me as much in this film because the historical characters helped to
draw some attention away from the more formulaic ones, and really added
a lot of spice. <br /><br />I don&#x27;t think this is one of Woody&#x27;s top five films, but it&#x27;s certainly
the best (and only) 2011 summer release I&#x27;m planning on seeing . . .
it&#x27;s slim pickings in the theater these days for people with a brain.
