Woody Allen is known for his love of schmucks. Every film he&#x27;s ever
made has the world&#x27;s biggest schmuck as a protagonist. Midnight in
Paris is no different, but it&#x27;s the freshest that Allen has felt in
years.<br /><br />Gil (Owen Wilson, in his best role in ten years) is this film&#x27;s
resident schmuck, this time a screenwriter who feels the Hollywood
scene is a bit hackey and overdone. He aspires to be a novelist in the
likes of Fitzgerald or Hemingway. When he travels to Paris with his
fianc&#xE9; Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents he falls madly in love
with the city, much to his materialist girlfriend&#x27;s dismay.<br /><br />Gil and his fianc&#xE9; find themselves walking around with an old friend
and fellow schmuck - a self-absorbed schmuck, but a schmuck none the
less - Paul (Michael Sheen, sporting an American accent) and his
girlfriend. They go dancing, to art museums, and are forced to listen
to Paul&#x27;s windbag ramblings on Monet and Picasso &#x96; much to Gil&#x27;s
dismay.<br /><br />One night Gil decides to skip out on the group and take a walk, he then
stumbles into the world of the 1920s where he meets the writers that he
loves and admires along with some of the other great artists of the
time (including multiple hilarious run-ins with Corey Stoll&#x27;s Earnest
Hemingway). Gil comes to love the Paris of yesterday along with Pablo
Picasso&#x27;s girlfriend, Adrianna (Marion Cotillard, always a welcomed
guest).<br /><br />Gil finds himself torn between past and present, Adrianna and Inez,
nostalgia and reality.<br /><br />This is film really took me by surprise. It was very light and breezy,
yet maintained my interest and held onto its integrity. For a plot that
seems rather gimmicky it manages to surpass its own flaws and manages
to be a really fun time.<br /><br />Owen Wilson gives his best performance in maybe his entire career with
this film. Wilson handles Allen&#x27;s comedy well and I hope these two
schmucks find it to their liking to collaborate again.<br /><br />As always Marion Cotillard does fine work. She&#x27;s an actress I&#x27;ve come
to expect nothing less of. There&#x27;s a vintage feel to all her
performances that manages to never feel stale and that&#x27;s a big help to
her role as a Parisian flapper girl.<br /><br />McAdams is the real dud of the cast, though she isn&#x27;t given much to
work with. Her parents, played by Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy, don&#x27;t
do much either &#x96; although Fuller&#x27;s character does provide an
opportunity for some left-wing/right-wing humor between him and
Wilson&#x27;s character.<br /><br />Kathy Bates, Adrien Brody, Corey Stoll, Tom Hiddleston, and Alison Pill
all supply hilarious, if not sturdy supporting performances that really
make this film quite a gem.<br /><br />However, Midnight in Paris is tremendously reference heavy and I got
lost a few times in the names of the artists. I&#x27;m not an art enthusiast
(unless you count film), but Allen is smart in making the artists funny
enough without needing to know their names or their works (much to this
critic&#x27;s delight).<br /><br />Despite some minor stumbles, Midnight in Paris handles itself
beautifully and creates a certain prestige of the Hollywood of
yesteryear. A nostalgic film for nostalgic folks.<br /><br />RATING: A
