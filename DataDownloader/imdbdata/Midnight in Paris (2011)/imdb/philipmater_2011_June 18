This film is a very enjoyable and whimsical little film that will
delight all ages. My wife and I had no idea it was a Woody Alen movie
until the credits at the beginning came on the screen and we had not
seen a film by Woody Allen since probably the 1980&#x27;s but it was very
nice and funny and romantic and creative. All of the actors did a great
job and I don&#x27;t want to give a way anything but there is a very
interesting turn of events during the film that makes it such a great
film. Everyone in the theater was laughing along and my wife and I
liked it very much. Will recommend to all our friends and all the
people reading this review because it will not disappoint.
