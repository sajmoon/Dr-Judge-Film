Subtle masterpiece and precise recreation of Euripides tragedy.<br /><br />Delicate art and science of light&#x27;s exploration. And a great casting.<br /><br />Same atmosphere of old Greek period, same taste of secret, duty and
sacrifice. And the splendid music.<br /><br />But the power of film consist in Owen Wilson&#x27;s Gil&#x27;s. A delicate acting
and form of cult . Noble homage for basic human values. And Rachel
McAdams- part of his character.<br /><br />Principal merit of film is gentle protection of skill. The tension of
silence, the deep force of gestures.<br /><br />So, &#x22;Night Time in Paris&#x22; is more of a beautiful movie. It is a
gorgeous &#x22;memento mori&#x22;.
