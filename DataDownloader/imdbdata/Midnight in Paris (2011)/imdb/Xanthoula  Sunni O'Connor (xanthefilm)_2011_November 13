Midnight in Paris is for me, one the best films that Woody Allen has
produced in a long time. The crux of the film encapsulates the need to
find escape from unhappy situations and for our protagonist writer, the
thought of a superficial existence in Hollywood, with wife to
be...leads him to escape into a wonderful fantasy. Amazingly, the step
from reality into fantasy is not to difficult after the first car ride.
As it is easy to join in on the journey - as we meet the talented, the
beautiful &#x26; charismatic. The production values of this film are
overwhelmingly wonderful. Allen&#x27;s mark as a director seems to be very
much on the American family, whilst it would seem the other actors have
a freedom to improvise.<br /><br />One for the girlz..move over Heathcliff ..Hemingway is here..lordy
