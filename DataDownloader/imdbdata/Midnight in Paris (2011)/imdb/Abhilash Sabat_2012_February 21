Well, just finished with Midnight in Paris. What can i say! Beautiful
Paris it is. All the pleasant and beautiful locations, colorful and
vibrant characters in the movie, romantically feel good fantasy filled
movie is what Midnight in Paris is. The movie has the usual Woody Allen
feeling.. the background score, the beginning and the end credits, his
direction and all the captivating and fascinating characters... But
this one&#x27;s a bit different than his other flicks and that would be
because of the story of the movie. Its quite different, interesting and
makes you want to know what&#x27;s gonna happen next. All good performances,
Owen Wilson&#x27;s best performance ever. If you wanna catch up with
something that&#x27;s visually beautiful and just need something that makes
you feel good and romantic... then this one&#x27;s for you. 7.5/10
