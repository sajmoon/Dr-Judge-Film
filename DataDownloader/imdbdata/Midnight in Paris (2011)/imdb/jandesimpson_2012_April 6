2012_April 6 
On two things Woody Allen&#x27;s admirers would agree, he is both a master
entertainer and a director of considerable technical accomplishment.
Most would also agree that his habit of producing one new work each
year has led him into the pitfall of unevenness, a fault he shares with
the French master, Claude Chabrol. But when it comes to identifying the
highs and lows of his over prolific career, the disagreement starts. Is
the &#x22;Annie Hall&#x22;, &#x22;Manhattan&#x22;, &#x22;Hannah and her Sisters&#x22; period really
his best? I have personal reservations about these and, at the same
time, I am aware that my own favourites are not always shared by
others. For me &#x22;Love and Death&#x22; is a comic masterpiece which manages to
sustain a stream of gags without ever becoming stale on repeated
viewings. &#x22;Radio Days&#x22; achieves that sense of nostalgia for a place and
time past that was the endearing quality of my favourite Fellini,
&#x22;Amarcord&#x22;. &#x22;Everyone Says I Love You&#x22; is a simply gorgeous musical
which takes the passing of a year framework adopted for &#x22;Hannah&#x22; and
improves on it. And what about the slyly wicked &#x22;Match Point&#x22; with its
echoes of Theodore Dreiser&#x27;s &#x22;An American Tragedy&#x22; - Woody at his
darkest and, dare I say, finest. And then there are those moments
particularly in his more recent career that get the critics saying
excitedly that Woody is over his self obsessed doldrums and has
regained something of his former brilliance. They said it with &#x22;Melinda
and Melinda&#x22; which I am afraid I found one great yawn. And now they are
saying it again with &#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; with perhaps rather more
justification. This is a quite charming film in the Woody Allen canon,
if, to my mind, a minor one. Not that it starts particularly
promisingly. In &#x22;Manhattan&#x22; the wonderful opening shots of New York
accompanied by a swirl of Gershwin, somehow conveyed the director&#x27;s
total immersion in his love of a great city because they were so
successfully subsumed into the context of the movie. A similar attempt
to do the same with Paris with little more than a set of picture
postcard shots is rather tame and conventional by comparison. Enter the
American visitors with their endless yakking in restaurants, hotels and
famous sites and I feared the worst, another one of Woody&#x27;s
conversation pieces going nowhere. But shortly into the film with the
stroke of midnight and the sudden appearance of the 1920&#x27;s car it all
changes and we are in that world of fantasy that Woody does rather
well. Remember &#x22;The Purple Rose of Cairo&#x22; and his contribution to &#x22;New
York Stories&#x22;! Here the hero first stumbles into the world of the 20&#x27;s
and then into La Belle Epoque meeting up with an assortment of the
great and famous, several of them rather good look-alikes. It&#x27;s all
enjoyable, clever stuff and if not quite one of his peaks, a
reassurance that even with just over 40 films behind him, Woody still
has the ability on occasions to delight and surprise.
