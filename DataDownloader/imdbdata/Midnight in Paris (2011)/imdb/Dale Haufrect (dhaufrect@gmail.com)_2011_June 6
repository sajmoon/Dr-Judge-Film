Yes, Woody Allen has written and directed another hit film that is
funny and nostalgic and socially meaningful. Indeed, &#x22;Midnight in
Paris&#x22; is so enticing that it outshines even some of his most recent
hits. Owen Wilson is a prince of a character as Gil, the present day
writer who is carried back to the years of the great impressionists and
interacts with them as easily as if he were transported by a time
machine. This is a romantic comedy that will entertain you while it
also brings to question relationships and the meaning of life: common
themes in Allen&#x27;s works. None of his fans should miss this masterpiece.
Don&#x27;t let it slip by unless you are home bound and wish to pick up the
DVD or Blu Ray at a later date. One may find that Vickie Christina
Barcelona was funnier, but this cinema is both clever and deep in
meaning. It is a top film of Woody Allen&#x27;s and a first class film of
quality and intellect.
