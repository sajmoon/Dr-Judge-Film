I wrote the other day that a mediocre Woody Allen comedy is still a
good comedy by any other standards (or something like that) and I stand
by that, but this is only part comedy. I mean, you wouldn&#x27;t call
Sleeper a sci-fi comedy, it&#x27;s a normal comedy set in the future, and
you wouldn&#x27;t call Curse of the Jade Scorpion a crime comedy (although
it parodies detective films) or Love and Death a historical comedy,
they&#x27;re very witty, mildly absurd, satirical comedy films with
different settings.<br /><br />Anyway, this isn&#x27;t just a comedy in a different setting, it&#x27;s a fantasy
romance with comic elements, a weak lead character and dependent to a
great degree on Americans&#x27; views of Paris. The comedy isn&#x27;t always the
main concern, the fantasy setting is a bit stereotyped but there&#x27;s a
twist or two, the romance is romantic enough, suspense is kept up well,
Owen Wilson is OK but not a good enough actor to make up for the lack
of snappy dialogue, the dullness of the character and being vastly and
madly outperformed by a certain Mr Hemingway and a Snr Dali, among
others. It seems to my European eyes that this is aimed again at US
viewers, rather than just being Allen&#x27;s personal vision. The &#x27;Americans
Abroad&#x27; perspective just doesn&#x27;t work outside the US.<br /><br />Worth seeing but don&#x27;t expect to laugh out loud more than 3 times.
