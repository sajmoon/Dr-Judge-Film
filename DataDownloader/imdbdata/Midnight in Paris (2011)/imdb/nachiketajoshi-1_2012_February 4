This is the height of solipsism! In the &#x22;extras&#x22; in the bluray, Woody
Allen mentions in the Cannes interview something about this movie that
gives a clue about why it is so lifeless and pretentious: he just
wanted to show the beauty of the Paris in a movie and shoot a movie for
that, story be damned! Why not just ask the Paris Tourist Bureau that
he would do it for them at a discounted rate, so he can indulge into
something he wanted to do in a proper context? I went to see this movie
hoping that it would be as decent as Vicky Christina Barcelona, with
Barcelona replaced by Paris and the rest of the charm intact. I was so
wrong! Oh well, I am not repeating the story etc. here, as plenty of
the reviewers did, but you are warned!
