Woody Allen has never made a film worthy of enshrinement in the
Pantheon. ANNIE HALL? Not quite. MANHATTAN? No. His early comedies?
Pretty close. PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO? The closest. However, no discussion
of late-20th Century film is complete without mention of his
personality, his formidable output, his Bergmanesque preoccupations,
and his style. Indeed, maybe he has made so many &#x27;nearly good-enoughs&#x27;
with such panache and duty that he will last forever. We look at
MIDNIGHT IN Paris, another movie that no one else could have made, and
the feeling is only strengthened.<br /><br />Allen must have been waiting to shoot the opening montage of this film
since he made MANHATTAN. It is a portrait of Paris no painter could
have done. Full, gorgeous, serene, textured, candid glimpses of the
great city of light. MIDNIGHT is undoubtedly the most visually mature
Allen picture. The deep and bold tones illuminate the magic and skin,
enough to make you yearn for Rachel McAdams&#x27; Inez (Sartre reference
anybody?) while she is terrorizing every scene she inhabits as the most
unforgiving witch of 2011. MIDNIGHT also makes clear that Allen has
matured so much as a writer, always his best skill. It is his most
visually expressive script after DECONSTRUCTING HARRY or possibly MATCH
POINT. I&#x27;ve often wondered how his writing might illuminate the work of
a director other than himself - a Coen or a Scorcese. <br /><br />As the Woody-Hero enters Golden Age Paris, we begin to discern the
obligatory fable. But in MIDNIGHT there is something else twisted in
from Owen Wilson&#x27;s performance. The look on his face before submitting
to the fantasy is striking; more striking is to what he eventually
submits. It&#x27;s exactly what makes MIDNIGHT the best Allen work since
CAIRO. Gil subdues himself to a will other than his own. He relents.
This is remarkable in the history of Allen stand-ins. Allen imbues
Wilson (a likely puppet) with his own jittery aimlessness, but also
commitment and less ego. Wilson takes these revolutionary Allen traits
and creates a Woody-Hero that is so fresh and so likable. Something we
have never seen before.<br /><br />The cameos inside of Golden Age Paris are magnificent, if fleeting.
Adrien Brody&#x27;s Dali is better than you can imagine and Hemingway is a
bright caricature. It is hard to describe the genuine treat of seeing
these wonderful heroes of the past in such color. One thing we can
always grant Allen is his steadfast ability to employ his fables for a
double meaning. Yes, there is joy in MIDNIGHT, joy is one of the new
and exciting characteristics. But his pessimism is not so far away. In
taking us one layer deeper into the Belle Epoque, we understand his
point. It&#x27;s impossible to be happy. Even our dreams of real happiness
are false. We imbue times and figures with an unquestioned brilliance.
Allen shows us that these feelings are no better than Paris in the
rain. Gil&#x27;s speech about a city being a work of art creates another
poignant conclusion. It is Allen reconciling the Hollywood Hack
(non-art) with the novelist (art), to understand that beauty is beauty.
A rhinoceros is a rhinoceros.<br /><br />There are flaws. Allen creates so many incredible characters and barely
employs them. His haste is his error. In some cases, it ends in crude
or abrupt plot developments. MIDNIGHT could have been 20 minutes longer
and it would have been a better picture, possibly one for the Pantheon.<br /><br />But Allen has created another work of wit, charm, and poignancy. It
doesn&#x27;t escape his obsessive pessimism, but it does show us a side of
him that we have never seen. One not cloaked in hateful sarcasm. One
not bleak or humorless. Not so relentless. MIDNIGHT allowed his humor
to be real. So maybe we will always remember Woody for his winding
career. As there are peaks and valleys, it is safe to say that here we
have a marvelous peak and perhaps the highest.<br /><br />91.443
