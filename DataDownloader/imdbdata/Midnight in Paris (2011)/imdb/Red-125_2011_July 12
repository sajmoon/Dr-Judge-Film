Midnight in Paris (2011) was written and directed by Woody Allen. The
bad news about this movie is that the &#x22;real&#x22; plot is ridiculous. We are
supposed to believe that Gil (played by Owen Wilson) would want to
marry Inez (Rachel McAdams) despite the fact that Inez is spoiled,
selfish, immature, and comes as part of a package that includes her
unpleasant parents and obnoxious friends. Yes, Inez is attractive, but
as a successful screenwriter, surely Gil could find other attractive
women with whom he&#x27;d be more compatible.<br /><br />The other part of the &#x22;real&#x22; plot that doesn&#x27;t compute is that Gil, a
handsome, strapping, Californian, would be channeling Woody Allen&#x27;s
nebbish character. When Gil whines, &#x22;That&#x27;s crazy,&#x22; in Allen&#x27;s singsong
voice, I just wanted to wince.<br /><br />The good news is that the &#x22;fantasy&#x22; part of the plot is great. Allen
knows how to present cities to us in the best possible light (in both
senses). Paris looks wonderful, the people in it look wonderful, and
the &#x22;conceit&#x22; of going back in time worked for me.<br /><br />So, I recommend that you see this movie, ignore the &#x22;real&#x22; plot, and
concentrate on Paris in an earlier era. As with most Woody Allen
movies, this film will work on a small screen.
