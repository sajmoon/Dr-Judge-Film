2011_July 1 
This is a lovely little film, extravagant in its visuals, with Paris
serving as another character in the story, looking glorious of course.
The photography alone is worth the price of admission. The premise is
charming and is executed in a believable way. The filming of it is
simple and effective, with no tricks, just as straightforward realism.<br /><br />The contemporary characters are out of Allen&#x27;s stock barrel of
characters. The two leads could be played by Allen and Diane Keaton,
but they are now too old to play them, so the young actors serve as
stand-ins for the two originals. Wilson has an interesting face but is
too good-looking and too WASP-y to play the &#x22;Allen character&#x22;. He does
a spot on imitation of Allan&#x27;s quirky mannerisms, vocal and physical,
in this role. I wish he hadn&#x27;t. I think a more original take on the
&#x22;Allen character&#x22; might have been more effective. Here, he just seems
like an imitation, and not a believable one.<br /><br />The writing is fair. The dialogue is Allen&#x27;s usual &#x22;realistic&#x22; way of
making his characters speak, which never seems like the way people
talk, just someones Idea of how they talk.<br /><br />The best part of this film for me are the time travel scenes, populated
by all of the main character&#x27;s heroes from the past. They could be a
dream, but they are executed with total realism. These roles are
written and acted with more success than the 2010 characters, which all
seem as if they actually belong in the 1970s, not the 2010s. All of the
great people the hero meets in these episodes are done quite well,
except for a stilted Hemingway (but how else could you portray a
character who was mostly bluster and defensive pretense in real life?)
Kathy Bates is the real standout as Gertrude Stein. She takes an
underwritten part and creates a portrait of the iconic figure not at
all as a caricature of her, but as real, breathing person, intelligent,
savvy and believable.<br /><br />The real problem with this charming film is that it&#x27;s too long for its
slight story. This might have been better as a short or as one episode
in a multiple-story film, which Allen has done before. Here, about
halfway through, it starts to drag and you begin to wonder...<br /><br />I think this is a fine little picture, but not a great one, and not one
of Allen&#x27;s best. I think it is garnering the praise it&#x27;s been getting
because it&#x27;s superb in contrast to most of the drek that&#x27;s being
released right now.
