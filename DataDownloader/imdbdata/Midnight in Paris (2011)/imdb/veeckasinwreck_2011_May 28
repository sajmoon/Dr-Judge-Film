Woody Allen plugs along decade after decade, stolidly churning out
films. Every once in a while, he catches lightning in a bottle. This
film is beautiful to look at, beautifully paced, beautifully acted, and
pure pleasure from beginning to end. The lead dresses like Woody,
although he has a physicality that makes his attraction to women more
plausible. Is it just me, or does he sound like Jimmy Stewart? The
women are absolutely gorgeous; Woody has not lost his knack for bathing
women in a transcendent light. The bad guys(a pompous professor, the
fianc&#xE9;e and her parents) are brutally sketched with perfect telling
details. And best of all is Paris itself, looking at least as beautiful
and magical as the New York of Allen&#x27;s classic films of generations
past. It is a movie about nostalgia, idealism, and those of us who feel
out of place in our own time, and it is nearly perfect.
