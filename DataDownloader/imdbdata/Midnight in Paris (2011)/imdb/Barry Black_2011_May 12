Woody Allen&#x27;s love affair with France, which goes back decades, finds
its finality with &#x22;Midnight in Paris,&#x22; the latest of Allen&#x27;s Parisian
brochures, which recently opened at the Cannes Film Festival on
Wednesday. The good news is that Allen seems to be paying attention in
a way he hasn&#x27;t always done in recent films, and has found a way to
channel his often-caustic misanthropy, half-comic fear of death and
anti-American bitterness into agreeable comic whimsy. The nominal point
of &#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; is that we&#x27;ve all got to make the best of life
in our own time while longing for a past that probably never existed.
If anything, Allen seems to be rebuking himself, ever so mildly, for
his compulsive romanticism, his obsession with the past and his
disconnection from contemporary American life. Allen has baked us a
sweet, airy Parisian dessert with just a sense of sentimental substance
in the finish. One of his better films in his latter years.
