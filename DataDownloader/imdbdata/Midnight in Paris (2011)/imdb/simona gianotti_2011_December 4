You have to be a little familiar with the golden age of the &#x22;roaring
20&#x27;s&#x22;, to be able to appreciate this dream-like movie: when Paris was
the centre of a brilliant and explosive cultural environment and people
like Hemingway, the Fitzgeralds and many other artistic geniuses
strolled around the city in search for inspiration as well as pleasure.
For me, it was one of the most charming literary period of all times,
that&#x27;s why I couldn&#x27;t but enjoy this lively picture, which gets to
render the enjoyable and intellectually brilliant atmosphere of those
times. Let&#x27;s admit that the subject and the setting could be enough to
make a movie appealing, but Allen reveals once again to be the best
director when trying to capture the spirit of a city: in this case, the
magic of the &#x22;ville lumi&#xE8;re&#x22; really springs out from every day-and
night framing, making the viewer feel like being there.<br /><br />There&#x27;s always the Allen character, Gil, partially neurotic but poetic
at the same time, but the characters I liked most are those magically
related to that literary past, in particular, Corey Stoll as Hemingway,
Marillon Cotillard as Picasso&#x27;s lover, but above all an extraordinarily
convincing Cathy Bates as Gertrude Stein. There&#x27;s some wisdom in the
dialogues, mainly focused on the perpetual human dissatisfaction for
the present, and the longing for a more intense and vivid past, and so
the contemporary Gil longs for the jazz age, the Jazz age longs for the
Belle &#xE9;poque, which in turn longs for the Renaissance.... to the
conclusion that the present is the only possibly vivid time, only if we
have the courage to live it. As I have already noticed in Allen&#x27;s
latest movie, the director is getting old and seems to be looking for
some final comfort, as if, once abandoned the caustic tone of the past,
he has turned to a more relaxed and peaceful one. With &#x22;Midnight in
Paris&#x22;, the story, and the way it is handled seems to confirm my
impression, and the result is a pleasant, enjoyable, lively comedy.
