I&#x27;ve never been a Woody Allen fan particularly but I found this film to
be one of the best I&#x27;ve seen in recent years. I am aware that people
think some of the references go over the heads of people but I don&#x27;t
think it mattered at all. Likewise, I didn&#x27;t think it &#x22;too guided&#x22;
(with the introducing by names of the characters). It&#x27;s a thoroughly
engaging story with great understated performances. A light romantic
comedy that I couldn&#x27;t take my eyes off. I watched it again very
quickly after the first time. Okay, Owen Wilson might be playing Woody
Allen but I&#x27;m fine with that. It might be what we need in the world.
Oh, and Michael Sheen is excellent.
