Am glad Woody Allen didn&#x27;t also act in it. Something about this guy and
the way he talks, doesn&#x27;t gel well with me. As for the movie, it feels
100% Woody Allen, too Woody Allen actually. My criticism is that, the
way the actors moved, posed, talked and even the camera pans, all felt
like something I&#x27;ve seen time and time again. Call it his signature but
I got bored in the end.<br /><br />The script was brilliant though, I really liked the concept. Am not a
big Paris fan but I can&#x27;t deny that it has a nice setting for making
movies. London (my city) in comparison feels grim and low quality.<br /><br />I hated the blonde actress (Rachel McAdams). She was terrible
(especially when she was stamping in and out of hotel rooms). I was
scared about having Owen Wilson in a Woddy Allen comedy but he was
great choice. No wonder the script had to be re-written to fit him,
haha.<br /><br />On a BBC Radio4 programme, Woody Allen asked &#x22;Why do People not go see
his movies?&#x22; (as in, his previous movies). My answer is that he should
either Direct or Write. Given his age and experience, I would lean on
the writing side. What I want to see from ageing actors or directors is
their take on the life that they&#x27;ve lived, boxed into a neat movie.
