Having recently purchased the DVD version of &#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; (2011)
an amazing great Woody Allen movie film - but the running time of the
received DVD is much less than the advertised running times as
specified at amazon.fr ---<br /><br />amazon.fr french version DVD running time is almost precisely just 90
minutes, and not the advertised 94 minutes as clearly stated on the
back cover of the french language DVD box ... ... DVD u.r.l. address
www.amazon.fr/Minuit-&#xE0;-Paris-Owen-Wilson/dp/B0054IQ5P2/ and not the
amazon.fr advertised 96 minutes ... ... BLURAY u.r.l. address
www.amazon.fr/Minuit-Paris-Blu-ray-Owen- Wilson/dp/B0054IQ5N4/ and not
the amazon.fr advertised 100 minutes ... ... <br /><br />- - - THE DETAILED EXPLANATION of the running time discrepancy is that
the whole movie is speed-up by about four percent on DVD. On the FRENCH
LANGUAGE DVD distributed by the Studio &#x22;TF1 Vid&#xE9;o&#x22; in France, when you
watch the original language version (English Language) the perceived
pitch of everyone&#x27;s voices has changed to a four percent higher pitch.
For unknown reasons the movie transfer from motion picture film stock
to PAL video for DVD was done at 25 frames per second, and worldwide
the original motion picture film was projected in cinemas at 24 frames
per second ... ...
