Charming latter-day Woody Allen film is crafted as a love letter to
Paris and nostalgia. Though Owen Wilson (not as bad as he could&#x27;ve
been) and Rachel McAdams (lovely but terrible as usual) are miscast,
Marion Cotillard is perfect again as a dreamy muse for a writer who
wishes he was living in the 1920&#x27;s.<br /><br />Though beautifully photographed and with a great soundtrack, this isn&#x27;t
as strong an entry as &#x27;Vicky Cristina Barcelona&#x27;, but should please
Woody Allen fans and anyone who has dreamed of going back in time to
more romantic and inspiring days - and nights.<br /><br />Check out full reviews at theschleicherspin.com
