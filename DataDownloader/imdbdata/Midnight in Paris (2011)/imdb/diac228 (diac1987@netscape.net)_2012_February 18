The world must be ending. It has to be. There is no other explanation.
All the signs of the apocalypse are there. I actually thoroughly
enjoyed a Woody Allen movie. I know, it&#x27;s absolutely crazy, but
nonetheless true. While most of your die-hard Allen fans will point out
the superiority of Annie Hall, Manhattan, and probably to a lesser
extent Match Point, I consider Midnight in Paris to be among his best
if not his best film. The writing was fluid without becoming
condescending or exaggerated, the acting is superb, the cinematography
nearly flawless, the editing was quite sharp and best of all it was
just a fun and unique trip through a city the medium of film has
explored so many times.<br /><br />Midnight in Paris follows a struggling writer Gil (Owen Wilson) as he
accompanies his fianc&#xE9;e (Rachel McAdams) and her family on a vacation
to Paris. Falling in love with the city far more than everyone else in
the party, the writer discovers that on a certain point in time in a
certain area, he inexplicably is transported into his favorite time
period and meets his favorite artists and influential individuals that
shape his taste in literature, art, and music. The deeper he dwells
into the 1920s, the further distance he feels from his life in the
modern time. Watching this movie is like being part of a great inside
joke; as you&#x27;ll get much more of a kick out of this plot if you know
most of the artistic geniuses that the main character runs into.<br /><br />Woody Allen&#x27;s script here is nowhere near as deep, complex, or as
thought-provoking as some of his works from 70s and 80s, but still
works like a charm because of the creativity involved. Allen creates a
dreamlike world that almost resembles artistic nirvana as we see our
protagonist embed himself into the universe of 1920s Paris, which has a
very different look, texture, and feel to the modern-day image of the
romantic city. It&#x27;s a lot of fun to see him bounce back and forth
through time and realize how different he acts, reacts, and behaves
depending on where (and when) he is.<br /><br />Owen Wilson is definitely a major player in the quality of this movie.
He plays his role with such glee, such happiness and respect towards
the subject matter involved that you can&#x27;t help but feel sorry for him
as he slugs his way through 2000s Paris with his disenchanted group.
The rest of the cast also contribute greatly, ranging from Marion
Cotillard as the beautiful and mysterious Adriana to Corey Stoll as the
charismatic and unique Ernest Hemmingway. Rachel McAdams plays a role
very different to her usual fare by being the mean-spirited and
ignorant antagonist that is slowly sucking the life out of Gil. Love or
hate Allen, he&#x27;s usually good at casting the right cast, and Midnight
in Paris is definitely no different. Keep an eye on the First Lady of
France having some screen time in the flick.<br /><br />What makes this movie special is that you can&#x27;t really dislike it or
hate it. There is this everlasting charm and bubbly personality brewing
in the film that makes it impossible for you to dwell on any of its
potential setbacks. From start to finish it was a quirky and engaging
adult fairy tale. This is a very fantasy-heavy film that never explains
the why or the how, it just places you in the passenger seat and takes
you on a wild entertaining ride.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Midnight in Paris is probably my new favorite Woody Allen
film as he crafts a very lighthearted and fun story that puts a twist
on the usual film about a vacation to Paris. The acting was wonderful,
the writing was better than Allen&#x27;s usual material (especially
recently), and the overall production value from cinematography to art
and costume design was above and beyond your typical low-budget movie.
This film never goes over-the-top, never dwells into muttered and
cluttered talk, and gives you a side of Paris you aren&#x27;t used to
seeing. One of the funniest and most unique films of 2011, you will not
be disappointed.
