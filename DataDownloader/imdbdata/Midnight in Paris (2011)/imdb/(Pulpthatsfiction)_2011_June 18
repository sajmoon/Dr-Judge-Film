Woody Allen does what very few filmmakers can do. He makes you fall in
love with the characters. All of his movies have been character driven
films and they all have a certain flare about them that separates his
films from everyone else and in Midnight in Paris it really shows. The
films stars just like all of his other films a huge cast of talented
actors. Owen Wilson, Rachael Mcadams, Marion Cotillard, Kurt Filler,
Alison Pill, and Tom Hiddleston. They all shine in this film and even
when some of the actors have small roles they leave a lasting
impression.<br /><br />If you love Paris you will differently love this love letter to the
wonderful city. Woody Allen continues to prove why he is considered one
of the best filmmakers around with this movie. Also Owen Wilson plays a
fantastic Woody Allen and gives the best performance of his career.
Alison Pill is wonderful with the southern accent and really shines in
her role as does Tom Hiddleston. Also There&#x27;s the always great Rachael
Mcadams who&#x27;s as talented as beautiful. Woody Allen shot Paris quite
wonderfully and makes want to live in Paris in the 20&#x27;s in the rain.
The script which was written in the mid 2000&#x27;s and Woody Allen tried to
get this film made but it was to expensive so he had time to work on
this script and it really shows because like some of his recent movies
like Cassendra&#x27;s Dream it probably would have been better with a little
more work on the script and here is prime example why.<br /><br />If this film does not get any accolades by the end of the year it would
quite shocking. Especially for the acting which everyone deserves
recognition. With its great acting and its wonderful writing and
directing this defiantly is one of the best films of the year.
