Unlike Allen&#x27;s many other films, &#x27;Midnight in Paris&#x27; has a more
surreal/dreamlike feel to it that couples well with the reality of it.
The film opens with some postcard shots of Paris and the visuals
continue to look stunning which adds to the dreamy feel (thanks to the
special effects, cinematography and wonderful jazzy score). It has that
same feeling of whimsy that most of Allen&#x27;s other films have. The
time-travelling theme has been marvelously explored in the story. This
film is especially relevant to those who think that life in so-and-so
year was easier, more exotic, more exciting more so and so than it is
in present. For Allen analyzes this theme through his protagonist who
is a writer dissatisfied with his novel and wishes he were living in
the 20s.<br /><br />This time Allen&#x27;s alterego is played by Owen Wilson who does a terrific
job here (one of his best). He reunites with the lovely Rachel McAdams
who is equally stupendous as the frivolous bitchy fianc&#xE9;e. Kurt Fuller,
Mimi Kennedy, Michael Sheen and Kathy Bates provide great support. And
what would &#x27;Midnight In Paris&#x27; be without the luminous Marion Cotillard
who can best be described as spellbinding? <br /><br />&#x27;Midnight in Paris&#x27; is colourful, elegant, surreal, funny and
delightful. It ranks among Allen&#x27;s best works. This is also his way of
showing respect to the artists and writers he pays homage to.
