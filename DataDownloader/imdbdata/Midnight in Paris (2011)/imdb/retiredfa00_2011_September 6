This is movie making at it&#x27;s best! Woody Allen has made a big comeback,
as far as I am concerned. I realize that some people may be unhappy
with this film because there is no automatic weapon fire, no ridiculous
chase scenes, very little CGI. It probably will be boring for those who
enjoy that sort of thing. There are no explicit sex scenes though
plenty of interesting adult situations. The scenery and music is
absolutely fabulous. I didn&#x27;t want to blink an eye for fear I would
miss some of the most gorgeous scenes that Paris has to offer. The
photography was great! Owen Wilson is absolutely fantastic, believable,
and lovable. The best acting I&#x27;ve ever seen him do. For those who enjoy
real life situations, and intelligent dialog and music, this is a movie
not to be missed.
