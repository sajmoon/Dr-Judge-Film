I must say that I felt a bit out of my element. I don&#x27;t know much about
European authors/painters/etc! There were a lot of names I didn&#x27;t
recognize. But it made me want to learn about who they were. My
partner(from UK) on the other hand wasn&#x27;t familiar with Fitzgerald so
that made me feel a bit better. I loved the cinematography! Paris is
such a beautiful city and I feel much like Gil, I could live there &#x26;
walk in the rain! It was very funny. Very entertaining. My family all
loved it ages 16-60! I almost expected to walk out of the theater into
the 1920&#x27;s! :) The theater we saw it in was VERY small. The smallest
movie theater I have ever been in, yet it was sold out &#x26; absolutely
packed. We couldn&#x27;t even sit together!
