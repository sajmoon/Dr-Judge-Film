2012_January 29 
Modern-day Hollywood screenwriter and novelist, on vacation in France
with his fianc&#xE9;e and her parents, travels back in time to Paris in the
1920s via a magical taxi-cab, meeting legendary literary and artistic
figures who help the writer put his work and his love-life into focus.
Writer-director Woody Allen, seemingly in love with Paris himself,
appealingly uses fantasy to both confuse and clarify reality...but
without interesting, disarming central characters, the confection seems
to cool early on. Stepping in for Woody, lead Owen Wilson doesn&#x27;t have
a dynamic screen presence (he fades into the foreground), and even the
comedic scenes that should work the smoothest--such as a bit involving
Rachel McAdams&#x27; missing earrings--have a bland denouement. Allen&#x27;s
nostalgia for the past is fun for awhile, but he doesn&#x27;t use it to
build momentum; fairly soon, we&#x27;re stuck in a revolving door of
personalities and romantic couplings, sequences which have an
attractive sheen but ultimately feel a little underwhelming. ** from
