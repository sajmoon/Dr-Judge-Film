This movie is funny, charming and clever. But perhaps more
surprisingly, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it has to balance that charm with
ponderous, grim, philosophy. Light and frivolous, although with an
interesting central point, the movie is Woody Allen in a good mood. A
friend of mine called the movie superficial, which I disagree with, but
it is certainly not Woody Allen trying to be deep, and I think that&#x27;s
great, because for me, the more profound Allen tries to be the more we
see the limits of his artistry. But here, he makes a funny movie with a
clever premise, good performances, absolutely gorgeous cinematography
and some wildly funny moments (the scene with the surrealists is so
wonderful).<br /><br />Definitely worth seeing.
