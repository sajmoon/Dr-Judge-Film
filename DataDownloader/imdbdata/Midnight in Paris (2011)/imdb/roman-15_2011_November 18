I&#x27;m a great fan of Woody Allen. That being said, I recognize that his
filmmaking is irregular. Some films are very satisfying, will others
seem like simple cinematic exercises (&#x22;Small Time Crooks&#x22;, has a scene
almost literally copied from an early 1960&#x27;s movie with Marcello
Mastroianni).<br /><br />If for some people Allen seems a bit too bland, movies like &#x22;Match
Point&#x22; show that he has a surprising and almost nasty streak.<br /><br />I first started reading of this film while it was still in the final
phases of production. Then was very surprised by the great reception it
had in this years Cannes film festival. So I really, really wanted to
see it: on the one hand, I love Paris, and also (mostly) love Allen&#x27;s
films, so it seemed promising.<br /><br />My first screening was on a flight from Madrid to Santiago a couple of
months ago. Even on the tiny plane screen, I loved the atmosphere, Owen
Wilson&#x27;s acting and the whole premise of the film.<br /><br />As soon as I got home, we went with my wife and *really* enjoyed the
film on the widescreen.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Because this film is mostly about an atmosphere and feelings. The idea
of perfection, the idea of the artist and the reality that perfection
can&#x27;t truly be achieved...<br /><br />And Paris is that: a city of ideas, atmosphere and feelings. A city
that has been a Mecca for artists for over 200 years. A city to walk
around in and discover the most amazing places (and people).<br /><br />For Woody Allen, a complete New Yorker, the idea of Paris (and Europe)
is certainly that: an ideal.<br /><br />That being said, the acting&#x27;s great. Minor members of the cast really
stand out (the detective with the distinctly &#x22;Bogart&#x22;, film noir air)
and the major members shine.<br /><br />It&#x27;s great to see Owen Wilson in the role of Allen&#x27;s alter-ego. Very
vulnerable.<br /><br />And the actor&#x27;s that portray the artist in the 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s are
incredible: Luis Bu&#xF1;uel, Salvador Dal&#xED;, Pablo Picasso, Gertrude Stein
and so many others...<br /><br />So if you&#x27;re a fan of Woody Allen, and of Paris, don&#x27;t miss this film.<br /><br />And if you&#x27;re *not* a Woody Allen fan, also try to see it, because
it&#x27;ll show you aspects of humanity that shouldn&#x27;t be filmed.<br /><br />I guess the only people who shouldn&#x27;t see the movie are those that
actively dislike *both* Woody Allen *and* Paris.<br /><br />And certainly there aren&#x27;t many of those...
