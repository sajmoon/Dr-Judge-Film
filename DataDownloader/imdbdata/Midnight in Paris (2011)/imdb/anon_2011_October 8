I worried a bit in the beginning that I might find it a bit &#x22;banal&#x22; as
I live in Europe and Paris is not exactly &#x22;exotic&#x22; to me. But -Oh My
God- the plot was fantastic! Deep, meaningful and real. Owen Wilson at
his best; I always loved his voice, natural talent and general style
and in this movie his voice and general style is a unique asset. The
casting was very spot-on! I would have hated to see any other main
actor for this movie and the same goes for Carla Bruni&#x27;s role, and most
of the other smaller roles. The humor, the unexpected turn of events,
the mystery, the romantic turn to the literary past of an old city, the
beautiful people and gorgeous Paris scenes by day and by night were
just &#x22;rich&#x22;. I would see it again at the drop of a hat. Great job!
