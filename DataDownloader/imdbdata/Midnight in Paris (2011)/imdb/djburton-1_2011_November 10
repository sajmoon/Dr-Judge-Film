So, what&#x27;s a once brilliant but now soggy and complacent director to do
when the only people crazy enough to lend him money anymore are
European financiers who insist on one dimensional, flattering,
sycophantic depictions of their capital cities ? The answer to this
question can be most clearly appreciated in the over-hyped, lazily
scripted &#x27;Midnight in Paris&#x27;. It is an indictment of the quality of
Allen&#x27;s output over the past 20 years that this film is garnering such
positive reviews, but also speaks to the desire of many to see this
former great of American filmmaking fire up his old magic. The central
conceit of this movie is whimsical enough but quickly evaporates as it
becomes apparent the excruciatingly contrived dialog and poorly written
characters are only getting worse. Owen Wilson acquits himself well,
but can&#x27;t really rise above such weak material. It begs the question -
why do A-list actors willfully submit themselves to appearing in
Allen&#x27;s increasingly lazy movies for far less money they could
otherwise earn for their time ? There is no cachet in appearing in a
Woody Allen film anymore. People should stop indulging him. Audiences
would be best served re-visiting his work pre-1992.
