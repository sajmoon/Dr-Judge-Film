ONE LINE REVIEW : Light romantic comedy as told by the master. RATING :
Wait for the Instant Download (Ratings: &#x22;See it in the theater&#x22;, &#x22;Wait
for the Instant Download&#x22;, &#x22;Don&#x27;t Bother&#x22;)<br /><br />NO SPOILERS<br /><br />&#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; finds Gil (Owen Wilson), a successful screenwriter
and script doctor, on vacation in Paris with his fianc&#xE9; Inez (Rachel
McAdams) and her parents (Kurt Fuller, Mimi Kennedy). Gil is taken with
the city and contemplates living there and finishing his novel. (He
imagines that he was born in the wrong time and should have been in
Paris when the great writers lived and worked there.) Opposed to Paris,
his fianc&#xE9; wants to live in Malibu while Gil works in Hollywood. Gil
likes to take long walks in Paris. During one of his walks he is picked
up by an antique motor car that whisks him back to the 1920&#x27;s where he
meets his idols and a fetching young woman, Adriana (Marion Cotillard).<br /><br />This is a Nice Little Picture. Owen Wilson is basically playing Woody
Allen, talking out loud what goes on in Allen&#x27;s head, I presume. The
jokes are mild (fair and balanced jabs at Republicans and retorts about
Democrats). The characters are cartoonish, even stereotypical. And it
is all very charming. Gil meets F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda
(the adorable Alison Pill), Picasso, Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates),
Ernest Hemmingway, and many other colorful characters. They all give
Gil advice on what it is to be an artist.<br /><br />About the only thing I actually hated was Allen&#x27;s explanation of the
point of the film. We get a close up of Gil&#x27;s face as he reasons it all
out for us. I think most people who watch this film will be able to do
the reckoning that is necessary to appreciate the message. My good
friend Martin Bennett taught me the phrase &#x22;on the nose&#x22; &#x96; which is
used when a writer has a character express their emotions for the
audience. I hesitate (twice) to judge Woody Allen (who puts out a film
about once a year), but I really think he should have let us take the
message home ourselves, rather than dishing it out in stark terms.<br /><br />I liked this film, and I recommend it as a home viewing because it is
classic Woody Allen. He plays here with time travel and gives no
explanation of how it works &#x96; it is just the magic of Paris. And that
is fine with me, and I think it will be fine with you as well.
