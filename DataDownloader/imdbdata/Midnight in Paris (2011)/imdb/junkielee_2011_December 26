I&#x27;m not a firm buff of Woody Allen&#x27;s films and also unable to catch up
with his prolific filmography, I skipped his last two features YOU WILL
MEET A TALL DARK STRANGER (2010) and WHATEVER WORKS (2009) after a
delightfully absorbing VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA (2008) <br /><br />MIDNIGHT IN Paris has been hyped to be a new pinnacle of Allen&#x27;s late
career (a career peak in the North American box-office too) since its
release, maybe even nourish a slight chance for a BEST PICTURE Oscar
nomination, which has been long overdue for any Woody&#x27;s pictures since
HANNAH AND HER SISTERS (1986), but after my viewing, I find it not so
rosy on its Oscar path, I presume the sole possible chance is still
Allen&#x27;s strong suit, the screenplay and that will be all!<br /><br />I like the film by and large and I find the back-from-the-future plot
is intriguing at first, then after the unorthodox Cinderella-esque
midnight wander becomes the the inscrutable linchpin, the arrest
deflates bit by bit while an intense concussion of bathos becomes
presiding. Clearly the film is a love-letter (maybe a love-postcard) to
Paris from Allen (strangely there is no French funds for the film,
which is indeed a Spain-USA concoction), maybe I have no such
approbation for Paris (a city doesn&#x27;t tempt me for a must-see visit),
so I feel neutrally immune to the cameos from those prominent artists
of1920s (the only memorable presence is none other than Corey Stoll&#x27;s
chivalric Hemingway, who manages to exude a few wisdom from his
sidelined character, his remark about a true hero&#x27;s
not-afraid-of-death-status is biased but contains Woody Allen&#x27;s own
sullen wit). Basically speaking, there is no single performance is
outstanding like Woody&#x27;s previous works (notable for its notorious
hotbed for BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS nominations), but female characters&#x27;
overpowering poise is always there, my personal penchant leans to
Rachel McAdams&#x27; stereotypical mean woman caricature, repelling enough
so as to that I adore her more, not the character but the acting per
se. Marion Cotillard is being squandered drastically, but it will not
hurt her charisma; other numerous secondary characters are all nothing
but linear. <br /><br />The film proposes a contentious subject matter, a nostalgia addiction
of the Golden Age, but in my opinion, why don&#x27;t we just treasure art
itself without encountering the artists (or asking yourself before make
the move, &#x22;am I sure I can handle a true artist?), but if you are
aiming for a sizable discount, it would be a different cup of tea then.
