I love Woody Allen, so already I&#x27;m biased. But even I will admit that
he&#x27;s been spotty for the last...my God!...twenty years or so. &#x22;Curse Of
The Jade Scorpion&#x22; will forever be his lowest moment, and in his later
phase &#x22;Match Point&#x22; and &#x22;Vickie Christina Barcelona&#x22; remain the
highlights. Well, we can add another to that list. By no means is this
movie an &#x22;Annie Hall&#x22; or a &#x22;Manhattan&#x22;, let alone a &#x22;Husbands and
Wives&#x22;. But if you&#x27;ve been bored by what you&#x27;ve been seeing at the
Multiplexes lately, if you think &#x22;The Hang-Over 2&#x22; sucked and you&#x27;ve
despaired that the romantic comedy is dead...than I&#x27;m delighted to tell
you to go see this movie right now. See it on a big screen! It&#x27;s
gorgeous to look at, fun to watch, romantic, sweet, smart, and
pleasantly old-fashioned. This movie is not a masterpiece, and yet I&#x27;m
giving it 10/10 because it was perfect for what it was -- a modest
pleasure that left me in a great mood, and even a little inspired.
