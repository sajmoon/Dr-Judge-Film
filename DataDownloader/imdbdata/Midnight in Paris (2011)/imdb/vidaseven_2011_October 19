at first I can say that the idea of the poster is really great , you
can feel the movie even by seeing its poster. I liked the way this
movie pictured Paris , as a city to fall in love , as a city that you
won&#x27;t like to leave ! as you watch the movie you will say : wow can I
see this beautiful and amazing city once ( of course if you haven&#x27;t
been there before , like me ). but somehow I wanted it to seem more
real , not the story , the acts. I somehow think that Owen Wilson
wasn&#x27;t the best chance to act this role although I believe he really
did it great. I don&#x27;t know maybe I&#x27;m wrong but I expected them to be
more surprised in some parts or even see happiness in their faces.I was
going to forget to mention the exceptional music which really makes you
feel that you&#x27;re not in this world .
