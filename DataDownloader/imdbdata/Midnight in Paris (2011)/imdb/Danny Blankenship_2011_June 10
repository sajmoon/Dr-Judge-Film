I&#x27;m not the greatest Woody Allen fan in the world, yet I must say with
his latest &#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; it&#x27;s offbeat, funny and strange enough
to prove life can be interesting and misleading. It&#x27;s showcase of
wanting to dream and the wish for a change can lead to an illusion to
prove that your current fate wasn&#x27;t meant to be! Also a nice eye candy
treat is the work and performance from the sexy Rachel McAdams(one of
the big screens most enjoyable pleasures to watch). As with typical
Allen he keeps it offbeat and funny, he proves that life, love and
relationships are complex, and most of all fate is unexpected and life
can start anew.<br /><br />Set in the capital of France the to be married young couple Gil(Owen
Wilson)and Inez(in a sexy performance by the hot and cute Rachel
McAdams)have came along with Inez&#x27;s parents to adventure the city and
take the French culture. And one by one the arts and buildings,
museums, galleries, and fine wine eateries are a delight. Yet as Inez
aside from being a hot and sexy lady enjoys the material side of
France, her love Gil an author falls in love with the setting he wants
to live in France! He doesn&#x27;t want the California rich sun life that
Inez does.<br /><br />So one night while strolling the city Gil has an illusion he&#x27;s taken
back to 1920&#x27;s France! It&#x27;s with this strange meeting and with many
more trips back in time he sees France is more and more meant for him
and the love thing with Inez just wasn&#x27;t meant to be. Overall a film of
escapism and it proves dreams and illusions can wake you up to your
present world showing that past history can lead you to a new setting
and a chance to a new start of life and possible love.
