&#x22;Do you think it&#x27;s possible to love two women at the same time?,&#x22; asks
our protagonist Gil Prender to a tour guide discussed Auguste Rodin&#x27;s
love for his mistress and his wife. Like that&#x27;s the first time we&#x27;ve
heard that question in a Woody Allen movie. Infidelity, gorgeous women,
and neuroticism are some of Allen&#x27;s favorite motifs, so it&#x27;s really not
too much of a surprise that they all appear in Midnight in Paris.<br /><br />That said, Allen&#x27;s rendition of those ideas feels fresh this time.
Midnight in Paris is a sweet, fun romp through the art world of France.
This light comedy may not have some of the heavier messages about
adultery and art that previous Allen films have had, but Midnight in
Paris is, nonetheless, an enjoyable exercise in allusion to the Lost
Generation and artists of the 1920s.<br /><br />Midnight in Paris begins with the same idea of a man, in this case a
screenwriter named Gil played by Owen Wilson, searching for connection
with the real world. The protagonist is clearly a projection of Allen&#x27;s
self, but no matter. Gil is engaged to the Inez, played by a blond
Rachel McAdams who coincidentally (or is it?) looks like Scarlet
Johansson from Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Inez bores Gil with her
pretentious friends and spiteful parents, which ultimately causes Gil
to seek inspiration on his own time by drunkenly wandering that streets
of Paris. One night, he is invited into a car that takes him back to
the 1920s where he meets his favorite writers and artists, something
that eventually leads to a breakthrough in his work. A large supporting
cast includes Kathy Bates, Allison Pill, Adrien Brody, Michael Sheen,
and Marion Cotillard.<br /><br />Allen&#x27;s conception of Paris is just as romantic as the story itself.
The film&#x27;s physical look matches some of the complexities of the women
in that it appears to be almost splashed in gold. It is, after all, the
City of Lights. It&#x27;s a beautiful movie that matches the pretty faces of
its starring women.<br /><br />Allen&#x27;s screenplay leaps right off the page thanks to his cast, but
this too is something that isn&#x27;t unusual for a Woody Allen film. At his
best, Allen picks actors that play their parts with a sense of realism
that, when combined with some elements of the fantastic, charm the
audience. Just about everyone here manages to do just this, with the
exception of Rachel McAdams, who tries her hardest with an
underdeveloped character. Marion Cotillard is the best of the cast (as
per usual) in her role as Picasso&#x27;s mistress. She&#x27;s bursting with
sexuality yet she&#x27;s grounded in her ability to deliver her dialogue
with her natural French accent.<br /><br />Midnight in Paris is fantastique. In comparison to Woody Allen&#x27;s
previous tales of lust and spite, his newest film feels like a dessert
rather than a filling entree, yet this is exactly how a good, highbrow
summer movie should be. The cast shines just as bright as the lights at
the top of the Eiffel Tower and Allen proves himself worthy of his
place in society as a master director once again. By no means a
classic, Midnight in Paris is a pretty little diversion, one that is
grounded in a theatrical gimmick that totally works every time. This,
along with The Tree of Life, will be one of a few summer movies that
will dazzle visually (without explosions) and somehow manage not to
insult the viewer&#x27;s intelligence.
