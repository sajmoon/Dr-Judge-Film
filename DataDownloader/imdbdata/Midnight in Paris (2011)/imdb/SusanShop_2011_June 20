2011_June 20 
I have never been a fan of Woody Allen or his films, BUT Midnight in
Paris was so amazing!! Paris is wonderful, the characters are
wonderful, the lessons learned are wonderful probably because of their
simplicity, and their in your face common sense. The 1920&#x27;s in Paris
was a highlight of that city&#x27;s history, although Allen presents history
in the most delightful way possible. The only point I found jarring was
seeing French women wearing blue jeans in public. That was a new one
for me, as all the French women I have ever seen, even the ones working
in small shops, dress. The blue jeans had to have been some sort of
attempt to make the film palatable to Americans. I am going to go see
the film a 2nd time.
