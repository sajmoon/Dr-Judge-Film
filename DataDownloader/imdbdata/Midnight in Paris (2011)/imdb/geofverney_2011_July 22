I was about to write in the summary the following qualification for
this magical movie: &#x27;intellectual orgasm&#x27; but I was afraid of both
words. The word &#x27;intellectual&#x27; might scare some people away when it
simply means that watching this film is a dessert for the brain and a
visual orgy (Paris of today, Paris of yesterday) and the word &#x27;orgasm&#x27;
would scare the other people away because of its sexual connotation.
However, the qualification refers here (once again) to the brain. We
share the same astonishment as Wilson&#x27;s character as he meets Legends
of the Arts and we just go along the ride with an exhilarating feeling.
You can feel that Allen has a deep knowledge and passion for both these
luminaries and Paris and we are happy to share it with him. He also
make us think about the respective values of one&#x27;s fulfillment through
materialism or spiritual (through literary inspiration). And that&#x27;s
probably why he is more popular in Europe and particularly in France
than in the US...<br /><br />And I have to say that Marion Cotillard is once again a treat to watch
and for me she might be one day compared to the best actress in the
world: Meryl Streep! In this movie, she is literally the incarnation of
the City of Light.<br /><br />I got out of the theater very thankful to Woody Allen for producing
such an inspired and funny intellectual and visual treat.
