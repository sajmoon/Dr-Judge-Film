I must admit that I have been a fan of Woody Allen for many years and
that his works in many way reflects the how we aspire to live. With
beautiful settings in the early 1920&#x27;s and late 1800&#x27;s, the movie gives
a cinematic taste what would a night-out be like (dancing, spirited
dialogues, and perhaps an emphasis on creating of era-changing
artworks). The message is clear: disliking the present leads to
nostalgia; Allen did mention earlier in the movie &#x22; nostalgia is the
denial of painful present&#x22;. But how far- back can one go to find
his/her &#x22;perfect&#x22; place/time to live life. Audience may be faced with
choosing the story to be taking the short-cut (not braving to tackle
present&#x27;s challenges) or go along with a worry-free lifestyle that fame
and fortune are not priorities.<br /><br />Arts and not science, religion, nor even philosophy can provide some
help as we &#x22;all fear death and question our place in the universe&#x22;;
perhaps arts can salvage us from our own &#x22;despair and emptiness&#x22;.
