Woody Allen&#x27;s charm is here in full effect. Watching Owen Wilson
walking down the beautiful streets of Paris and transport back in time
is very &#x22;Allen-esque.&#x22; Owen Wilson plays Gil, who is soon to be
married. He wants to stay in Paris, but his fianc&#xE9;, Inez, doesn&#x27;t which
causes Gil to wander the streets at midnight, where he is taken to the
1920&#x27;s, where he always wanted to live. It is a simple plot, with a
simple, and can I say cute, message. Owen Wilson is on the top of his
game here, and he contributes to the funny moments of the movie. The
rest of the cast was fine, playing the roles to predictable. The
characters that Gil are introduced to us are each unique, and
interesting. Especially Brody&#x27;s cameo, which was done very well.<br /><br />The best part apart this movie is the cinematography. Every shot is
beautiful and Woody picks some perfect locations, and there are a lot
of famous landmarks. A lot of the shots contain a lit up Eiffel Tower.
