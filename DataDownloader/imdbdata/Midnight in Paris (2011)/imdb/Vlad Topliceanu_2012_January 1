2012_January 1 
OK, how about I start this review in a classic way, by promoting the
film. Ladies and gentleman this is a movie directed and written by none
other than Woody Allen. Just to give you a short resume of his, he has
won an Academy Award for Best Director for Annie Hall and has earned
another 5 nominations for Best Director. He has won 2 Academy Awards
for Best Original Screenplay for the movies Annie Hall and Hannah and
Her Sisters. He has been nominated another 12 times for this award. He
also has a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading
Role, also for Annie Hall. I think you can figure out a conclusion from
all I just mentioned in this paragraph.<br /><br />Now to get into the film. This is a beautiful romantic comedy, and
probably the best I&#x27;ve seen all year. Owen Wilson gave one of his best
performances ever, but I still do not consider it Oscar material.
Michael Sheen as Paul Bates probably gave his best performance of the
year. But, to be honest, all of the actors that worked on this project
were great in their roles. Also I thought the script was great,
beautiful and is probably going to gain Woody Allen his 15th Academy
Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay. For me, it is the best
screenplay of the year so far.<br /><br />OK, now I usually don&#x27;t say this but Owen Wilson does not deserve
Rachel McAdams(talking about the characters). He deserves better than
that broad. Just wanted to mention this.<br /><br />One of the things I really liked was Adrien Brody&#x27;s cameo appearance.
What, his name is written alongside the other main characters of the
film?! NOPE. His screen time was exactly 3 minutes and 25 seconds. But
I have to say, he was one of my favourite things about this film. I
just laughed the whole time he was on screen.<br /><br />To sum up this is a great film and surely one of the best of 2011.
