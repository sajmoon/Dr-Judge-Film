Woody Allen just gets better. He really seems to have come into his own
as a director during his European odyssey. A year ago we were all
thrilled by Vicky Christina Barcelona which also got Penelope Cruz a
deserved Oscar nod. He is certainly a better director than he is an
actor. As an actor he brings a little too much of his hyper self-
examination which can become tedious. <br /><br />Midnight in Paris is sweet and lively. It is full of pretentious
characters but is an unpretentious film. The message is simple and
delivered with consistent light humour. &#xA0; Owen Wilson fits in
perfectly, just as he does in Wes Anderson material. &#xA0;Marion Cotillard
is suitably beautiful and enigmatic. The rich Americans are
pitch-perfect characters. Particularly fun is the agonising cultured
intellectual who you just want to throttle, particularly when opining
on wine, Monet and Versailles. There is also a great little semi- cameo
turn from Carla Bruni. <br /><br />Allen doesn&#x27;t try to be clever about Paris. All the clich&#xE9;s are there -
the sights, the caf&#xE9;s and the romance but the French characters are
cast in a favourable light. You really get the sense that he likes the
French, even if he doesn&#x27;t quite understand them.&#xA0;<br /><br />The basic premise of Midnight in Paris will make some wince. The way
the starlets of the 20s are forced into the narrative is not all that
natural and perhaps contrived. But for me it works and it is a
necessary part of the concept. It does rely on the viewer knowing these
characters from the 20s and &#x27;getting&#x27; the joke about who they are
portrayed.<br /><br />I think Woody Allen is one of the great auteurs. He doesn&#x27;t create
grand masterpieces but he does have an absolutely unique and consistent
voice. The world would be a poorer place without him. for me the only
other directors who are so instantly recognisable for their style are
Almod&#xF3;var, Bergman and Spike Lee. Thirty seconds into a blind viewing
and you can name the director. Roll-on more of the &#x22;Woody Allen does
Europe&#x22; era!
