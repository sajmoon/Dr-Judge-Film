midnight in Paris is a fantastic movie about generations upon
generations of nostaligic regret, and the contrast with the dismal
present, because life itself is unsatisfying! yes its unrealistic and
coincidencially romantic at times, but thats the point! its a movie
about the movies, and a fabricated era filled with wonder and insight
into the past... man... i mean i know the movie takes notions from
older movies, like Les Quatre Cents Coups and it&#x27;s description of
France&#x27;s failing generation, but it does it well and im glad such a
good movie has been made in the 21st century with such great
inspirations from the past.
