A lot of us go about our lives wishing that things were different. Many
people become so accustomed to the lives their leading that they wind
up being easily bored after awhile and dream of living in the past,
especially since the world seems to be getting worse and worse.
Midnight in Paris deals with themes of nostalgia and what makes us want
more out of life. Woody Allen opens the film with beautiful shots of
Paris, showing us that this is a place we should be if we&#x27;re not
already there. Paris is more than a great vacation spot, it&#x27;s an escape
from the harshest places in the world and is a nice, classy environment
where very little goes wrong.<br /><br />The film is about a group of Americans visiting Paris, specifically a
couple. Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) is a writer who is both fascinated and
bewildered by Paris. He doesn&#x27;t seem to be completely happy in his
relationship with Inez (Rachel McAdams), so he goes out one night and
finds himself in the past, where he meets his favorite writers that he
looks up to, as well as many other familiar faces, and he goes back
every night from that point on, and sooner or later meets and falls in
love with Picasso&#x27;s mistress, Adriana (Marion Cotillard), who many
artists like to paint pictures of because of her stunning beauty. Gil
learns a lot more about himself and what he can do to improve his
writing and his life in the process of his nostalgic psychological
journey.<br /><br />The film is very charming and Woody Allen&#x27;s writing is just as clever
and witty as it&#x27;s always been. This is definitely one of the best films
he&#x27;s made in awhile, and it&#x27;s a beautifully shot and unique film with
strong performances, and one that makes us look inside ourselves and
think about why we so often yearn to venture backwards instead of
forwards. It&#x27;s one of the best and most enjoyable films of the year.
