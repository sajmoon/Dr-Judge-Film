Midnight in Paris is a very imaginative and entertaining film about
that you should appreciate what you have in the present. The film is
very nicely filmed and it shows much of the city&#x27;s beautiful
surroundings. It&#x27;s a really fun film filled with wonderful music and
the actors were really good. During the film there was a lot of funny
situations that Gil (Owen Wilson) ended up in and I could identify
myself with the character many times throughout the movie. Although I
thought the movie was predictable I didn&#x27;t think it was any less
boring. I recommend the movie to anyone who just wants to watch a nice
and fun movie.
