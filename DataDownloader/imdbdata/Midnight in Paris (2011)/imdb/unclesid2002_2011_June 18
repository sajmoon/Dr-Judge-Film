Before sharing my reservations, let me note:<br /><br />1) Others in the theatre seemed to be enjoying this movie before I
walked out 2) I&#x27;ve enjoyed some of Woody Allen&#x27;s recent movies (Vicki
Christina Barcelona, Whatever Works), so I think I had pretty fair
expectations.<br /><br />I was looking forward to this movie based on all the reviews I read.
One of them noted that Owen Wilson was a surprisingly excellent choice
as the Woody Allen &#x22;character&#x22;/mouthpiece.<br /><br />After the seductive opening of scenes of Paris (think of the valentine
to NYC at the beginning of Manhattan), I found it incredibly jarring to
hear what were basically the words and thoughts of a New York Jewish
intellectual coming out of a lanky Texan (a problem which was not the
case with Larry David in the same role in &#x22;Whatever Works&#x22;).<br /><br />I tried to work with it when I ran into my second big problem with the
movie - the fianc&#xE9;. As written, the character is cartoonishly
unappealing - I found it impossible to buy that these two people had
gone on a second date, never mind gotten engaged. The problem really
seemed to be with the writing - not with Rachel McAdams portrayal.<br /><br />When I walked out at the 30 minute mark, the fantasy aspects of the
story had kicked in and I should note that most of the new characters
seemed very well cast and acted. But the acceptance of fantasy requires
the suspension of disbelief and the movie had squandered plausability
for me at that point on these first two problems, I couldn&#x27;t stick
around for the ride.<br /><br />YMMV, and maybe if I had stuck it out it would have worked its magic on
me. But since my assessment of Owen Wilson flies in the face of reviews
I&#x27;ve read (and a few comments I&#x27;ve read here), I just wanted to voice a
contrarian view to be considered by those thinking of checking this
movie out.
