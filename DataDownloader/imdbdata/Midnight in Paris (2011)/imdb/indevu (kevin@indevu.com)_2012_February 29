Midnight in Paris follows a young engaged American couple vacation in
Paris. Gil (Owen Wilson) is a successful screenwriter longing to write
novel, who falls in love with the city and its effect on his
creativity. His fianc&#xE9; (Rachel McAdams) becomes more and more
frustrated with him as he becomes ever more engaged in a fantastical
Parisian world he discovers after midnight.<br /><br />If you like Woody Allen films, or are drawn to romantic comedies, you
will likely enjoy this film. If you are like me and don&#x27;t fall into
either of those buckets, but you feel like expanding your horizons,
here is your chance to do it. Midnight in Paris is a fun and clever
film.<br /><br />Three reasons you should watch it: 1. Owen Wilson is awesome in the
role - very natural and believable. 2. It&#x27;s one of those movies that
just makes you feel good for no particular reason. It&#x27;s fun and
lighthearted. 3. Art and literary aficionados will will appreciate the
creative integration of famous writers and artists.<br /><br />One thing you might not like: 1. As the film progresses, it
unnecessarily beats you over the head with its message. A few of the
forced philosophical conversations between characters are unnecessary
and distracting.
