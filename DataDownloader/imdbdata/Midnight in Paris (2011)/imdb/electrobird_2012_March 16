I think Woody Allen is the greatest American screenwriter and director
of this age - That if you can call him a director&#x85; he admittedly does
nothing but let the actors free to do their work, which is probably his
greatest quality.<br /><br />He&#x27;s been honing his skills for a long time now and at this point in
his life has made countless works of art. He was close to perfection
with Vicky Christina Barcelona, but perhaps that movie was way too
passionate. The Purple Rose of Cairo was a great fantasy, but maybe too
sugar coated. I think this time he got the recipe right. The movie is
simple, but perfect.<br /><br />From the opening images you get the feeling he is up to some greatness.
Mr. Allen presents us with a very unique and intimate portrait of
Paris&#x85; he shows us the roofs, the caf&#xE9;s, the people walking on the
rain. All from very singular perspectives. A Paris I never seen on the
postcards&#x85; Images of the City of Lights that makes you feel you are
there.<br /><br />The movie goes on unpretentious as Owen Wilson&#x27;s character and adorable
as Marion Cotillard&#x27;s Adriana. A delicate masterpiece that I enjoyed
for every second and as some great actors played some of my favorite
artists in history, I slowly tasted every single little piece of it
like a delicacy, hoping it would never end. This one deserves 10 stars.
