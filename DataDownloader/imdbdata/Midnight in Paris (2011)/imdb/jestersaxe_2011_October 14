Totally beautiful movie, one Of Woody&#x27;s easiest to follow, and I feel
he&#x27;ll get an even bigger audience for this one.<br /><br />The old &#x22;dreams come true&#x22; has never been done so perfectly.<br /><br />Much more subtle than his other works, and I&#x27;ll def watch again soon.<br /><br />Owen Wilson is excellent, as are the characters from the past.<br /><br />I&#x27;m lucky in that I share the main characters love of Paris, but anyone
who longs for a better time, or who enjoys nostalgia will definitely
enjoy this film.<br /><br />I didn&#x27;t expect to enjoy the movie as much as I did, and I was
pleasantly surprised with the storyline, having only watched it
originally for the scenery.<br /><br />This film has forced me to look back at other Allen movies
