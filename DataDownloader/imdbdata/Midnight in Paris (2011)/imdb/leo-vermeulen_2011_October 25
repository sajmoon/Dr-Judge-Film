Woody does it again! This is to my opinion the best feel-good-movie
since his superb &#x22;Everyone says I love you&#x22;. Allen is at his best when
he is telling about music and musicians. Was it (surprisingly) the
players that were singing in ESILY, this time he uses the real thing.
All the artist pass by in a funny, yet respectful way. Even the mostly
irritating Wilson is good as WA. Cotillard and McAdams are fine
replacements for Lyonne and Portman.Michael Sheen and Adrian Brody
deliver as usual. The photography is firm and relaxed. The end might be
a bit superficial and predictable. But then again: This is Paris! And
it&#x27;s in the atmosphere of the movie. I&#x27;m looking forward to his next:
Rome antic?!......
