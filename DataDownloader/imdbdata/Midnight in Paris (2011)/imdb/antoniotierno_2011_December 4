&#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; is different from the most recent Allen&#x27;s stories,
such as &#x22;Match Point&#x22; (telling about class), or &#x22;Vicky Cristina
Barcelona&#x200B;&#x22; (as celebratory about being hit by a European city). It is
a well crafted fable about romance and the pleasures had when
idealizing another artist&#x27;s era. &#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; is truly charming
and intelligent. The pseudo-cultured and provincial are perfectly
rendered by Inez and her parents John and Helen. Actors Kurt Fuller&#x200B;
and Mimi Kennedy&#x200B; deliver excellent performances, as well as Inez&#x27;s
friend Paul (Michael Sheen&#x200B;). The filming location (Paris, first time
in Allen&#x27;s movie) gets to represent very effectively the magnificent
stroll.
