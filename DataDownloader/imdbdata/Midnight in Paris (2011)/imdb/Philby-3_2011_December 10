This was a movie both frivolous and serious &#x96; a profound fantasy. You
might say a typical Woody Allen movie, but this one is one of his
better attempts at serio-romantic comedy. Gil (Owen Wilson) is a Woody
Allen avatar as he explores two themes, nostalgia and the meaning of
love. Gil, a Hollywood screen writer who hankers to be a novelist is
engaged to Inez (Rachel McAdam) but when they go to Paris with her
parents Gil starts having doubts, fuelled by contact with various
famous literary figures of Paris in the 20&#x27;s who magically appear to
Gil as he walks the streets after midnight. F Scott Fitzgerald and
Zelda (Tom Hiddleston and Alison Pill), Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll),
Cole Porter (Yves Heck), Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) and numerous
others all put in an appearance, most of them surprisingly ready to
help Gil with his novel and his love life.<br /><br />Obviously you have to suspend your disbelief here &#x96; but the portrayals
of these figures by various actors, though uneven, mostly ring true.
Gil may well have been dreaming but he finds that the &#x22;golden age&#x22; of
Paris in the twenties is not necessarily better than today &#x96; &#x22;nostalgia
ain&#x27;t what it used to be&#x22;, and that love is what conquers death.<br /><br />Owen Wilson fits the Woody character like a glove, though Woody is not
really a Hollywood hack writer. He is complemented by Marion Cotillard
as Adriana, his guide through the twenties, from whom he learns about
love.<br /><br />There is a lot of fun along the way, and some minor characters to keep
us entertained such as Paul (Michael Sheen) a know-all friend of the
couple and a celebrity museum guide (Carla Bruni &#x96; President Sarkozy&#x27;s
spouse). Paris is also a character, photogenic, and presented in strong
light for the day bits and warm yellow tones after dark. The film will
certainly not discourage tourism there, at least at the deluxe end of
the market &#x96; the hotels are 5 star and limos are everywhere. The
scripts sparkles - Woody seeks to entertain as well as philosophise -
and here he succeeds at both.
