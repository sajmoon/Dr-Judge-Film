I don&#x27;t love Owen Wilson, but I think this role gets every good quality
out of him possible, and his charm really drives the film forward.
Midnight is the perfect Woody pic because it has lightness, comedy,
human neurosis, philosophical drivel, and hatred for the same
philosophical drivel, all wrapped up together. I love the more Apatow
sort of comedies that dominate today, but this was a more classic and
thought-provoking sort of film that I think raises the standard and
refreshes the palette. I think it is great when a comedy can be
nominated for best picture, and this one certainly deserves to be this
year. Go see it for date night, and if you are with the right sort of
woman when you do, you should marry her.
