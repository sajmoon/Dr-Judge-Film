2012_January 29 
I fell asleep half way through. No elegant review or justification. It
just sucked. Owen Wilson is a terrible choice as the protagonist. He
weasels (yes, Pauly Shore or Spicoli) his way through the film like a
surfer high on weed. He adds no debt to the film. If he would be quiet
for a while, I might just like it. His incessant talking is annoying
and distracting. His character&#x27;s introversion is another very annoying
factor in this film. Why people are fawning over it is just another
example of padding the imperfect. Sometimes I think the studio is
pumping up films. Jennifer Anniston being named as the sexiest lady for
2011 comes to mind, especially after she just jumped the shark (ie
stole somebody else&#x27;s man.)
