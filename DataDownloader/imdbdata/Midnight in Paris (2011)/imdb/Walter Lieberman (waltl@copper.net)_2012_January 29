If you can imagine a really rich person making a sit-com you&#x27;ve seen
this movie Don&#x27;t let Woody Allen&#x27;s fame waste your time. The only plus
is there are really pretty actresses, but even that&#x27;s not enough to
justify this waste of good film.An old premise, magically living in
another time. See &#x22;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&#x22; . No
character development. Big star cameos that add nothing except to
impress you with the drawing power of Woody Allen&#x27;s name. Allen is long
past his prime. The music is bad and too loud, did I say the actresses
are very pretty. Watch TV ,read a book or go for a walk just don&#x27;t
watch this movie.
