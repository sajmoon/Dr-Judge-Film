Midnight in Paris <br /><br />My experience of this film is of a beautifully presented love poem to
Paris, lovely, delightful, introduced at its outset through sensitive
cinema portraits of the City accompanied by Sidney Bechet&#x27;s
affectionate call and response duet, gently carrying us along, saying,
&#x27;Abide with me, Gentle Viewer - This is a love story&#x27;. <br /><br />I understand that the story-teller&#x27;s art may emphasize Plot, Character,
or Setting, in any combination of related qualities, with blend and
emphasis varying throughout the work. <br /><br />While there is sufficient plot in this narrative to carry the armchair
viewer along, I&#x27;m thinking that the story line in our film serves
mainly as a supporting vehicle, providing a milieu lending meaning to
the essential spirit of the piece: the author&#x27;s delight in Paris, his
desire to share his sense of wonder in the art, culture, history, the
spirit of the city and its people. Plot and Character are minimal
interests here; this is a work celebrating its Setting, the Social and
Cultural Environment of the City of Paris. <br /><br />As an artist&#x27;s purpose is through their craft to stimulate in the
viewer, listener or reader an experience sympathetic with their own,
our author and director was thoroughly successful with me; I come from
this experience now, in love with Paris. I am eager to share this film
with friends. Thank you, Mr. Allen.
