I am not a fan of Woody Allen, but I do watch his movies from time to
time. This particular movie is quite a gem, as it does not feature
Woody Allen&#x27;s needy Jewish guy character. But... Owen Wilson is not the
right person for the role. He made what would be a nice sophisticated
romance movie into a run-in-the-mill romantic comedy. At least romantic
comedies are funny... This is not. <br /><br />How can a movie with all the right elements: Great settings, great
story, great plot and plot devices, go so wrong? Because the central
character is wrong. I almost wished Woody Allen&#x27;s usual character is
the protagonist. I would have believed in the movie more.
