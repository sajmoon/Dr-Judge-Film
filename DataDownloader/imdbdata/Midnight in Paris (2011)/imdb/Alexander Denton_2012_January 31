I really didn&#x27;t expect that 80 years old Woody after 40+ movies would
be able to produce something like this, but he did. Without any
question - Midnight In Paris IS the best piece of his entire catalog
(and yes I&#x27;ve seen them all). I never even liked Woody&#x27;s movies that
much since they were mostly the same funny/relationship clones (with a
few beautiful exceptions like Cassandra&#x27;s Dream), but with this one he
topped himself, everything went right - smart and funny story,
beautiful Paris locations, great music, precise actors and magic
concept. If you are an artist, or at least you love art and you&#x27;re a
romantic soul you&#x27;re gonna LOVE this. I&#x27;m not surprised by all the
awards and by the fact that this became by far his commercially most
successful film because it&#x27;s all so alluring, you can watch this over
and over without getting bored. Some of the scenes like the first
meeting with Hemmingway, or the dialog with surreal guys are absolutely
priceless. Bravo Woody, as Gertrude Stein would say in this movie - If
you&#x27;re gonna keep on making films like this, you will have something of
value! 10/10
