The love between the French and the Americans has always been mixed
with an element of dismissal even contempt but the love is real. Woody
Allen walks that fine line in truly inspired fashion. &#x22;Midnight in
Paris&#x22; is a delight. This is he first time I actually loved Owen
Wilson. He is terrific as Woody&#x27;s alter ego. Rachel McAdams superb. Her
mean American girl is hilarious and frighteningly recognizably, so are
Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy as her parents. What a chillingly awful,
normal pair. I loved the moment in which Owen Wilson, in a great close
up, comes to accept what&#x27;s happening around him. I accepted it too.
Happily. Another stand out moment: the meeting with Salvador Dali,
played brilliantly over the top by Adrien Brody. Highly recommended.
