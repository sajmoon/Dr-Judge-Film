Of course, this is typical Woody Allen soul searching slop and it is
the first of his films I have watched (all the way through) since Annie
Hall.<br /><br />What made me watch this one then? The imagery! You MUST watch this film
from the very beginning to appreciate the wonderful images of Paris in
the opening credits. It has made me want to go to Paris, camera in
hand; and go and find the Paris that Allen shows there.<br /><br />Otherwise, Owen Wilson does well even though is character is a bit of a
burbler and the concept of going back in time is a bit twee.<br /><br />Duncan
