It&#x27;s so nice to see Owen Wilson back in his comfort zone. This is a
good Woody Allen movie and Woody seems to have found a new muse in
Owen. His speeches are much as you would expect Woody to speak if he
were to take the role himself. Owen plays a fianc&#xE9; experiencing Paris
while his future family seem to just want to get out of there. Owen&#x27;s
character seems more interested in writing a book and becoming a
Bohemian. It is these ideals that are explored and explored
well......but with a twist that is quite new. The movie also showed
that it is still possible to be good adult entertainment without smut,
sex, profanity or violence. Recommended ****
