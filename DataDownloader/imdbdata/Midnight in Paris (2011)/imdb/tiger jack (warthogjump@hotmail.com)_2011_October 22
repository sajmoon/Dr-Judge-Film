Woody Allen has done an excellent job in Midnight in Paris (MIP).<br /><br />There are a lot of special features about this movie. The dialogue
(script), the acting, the score, the cinematography.<br /><br />Midnight in Paris provides a lot entertainment without essentially
&#x22;going anywhere.&#x22; It isn&#x27;t an extraordinary story. It doesn&#x27;t provide
some deep meaningful message. It&#x27;s merely a bunch of interesting
dialogue mixed with outstanding acting put together to provide good
entertainment.<br /><br />The kind of entertainment I speak of in MIP isn&#x27;t the ordinary type of
&#x22;entertainment.&#x22; It&#x27;s a rare kind of entertainment and can only be
found in certain movies. Pulp Fiction is the other prime example that
springs to mind. Although very different in genre and script, there was
one broad striking similarity I noticed between the two movies. They
both have no purpose, no story (or at least, the &#x22;story&#x22; is used as a
scapegoat to present the desired script in the movie), there basically
isn&#x27;t any real &#x22;reason&#x22; to see the movie. It&#x27;s just about nothing. But
what both movies succeed to do is just make you watch the movie,
immerse yourself in it, provide you with a different kind of &#x22;comedy.&#x22;
It isn&#x27;t comedy that makes you laugh out loud (for the most part) and
it isn&#x27;t failed comedy. It&#x27;s the kind of comedy where you simply get
subtle enjoyment from, you let out an occasional smirk or smile, but
the smirk isn&#x27;t necessarily in relation to the a specific comment in
the movie, rather it&#x27;s a smirk signifying your quiet enjoyment towards
the film generally. You can sit there continuously for hours and days
following repeated viewings of the film and not get bored simply
because its so enjoying to watch. That&#x27;s the kind of entrainment MIP
offers and for the very same reason, it will attract negative attention
from certain viewers, but not from me.<br /><br />Next, the cinematography. Oh my gosh! I could have given this movie a
10 without the rest of the movie being so good. I, having visited
Paris, for unfortunately not too long a period, fell in love with the
city. It is the most romantic and beautiful city I have ever seen. It
really is the city of love and all expectations were not only as good,
but better. I hold this thought even though some friends I know of have
had, well, not as great an experience as myself.<br /><br />Woody manages to capture the beautiful presence of Paris like no other
director. I felt like I was back in Paris and it sometimes managed to
put a chill down my spine because of the amount of beauty I was both
witnessing and remembering. I really can&#x27;t say anymore about the
cinematography except that it is the best, it is flawless, it is
exceptional and if you have ever been to Paris and loved it, you&#x27;ll
definitely love this movie.<br /><br />Moving onto the acting, I&#x27;ll settle this briefly. Although MIP has a
lot of very solid small roles (Rachel McAdams was very average, but I
think that&#x27;s how her character was intended to be), Owen Wilson is the
complete stand out. Although I can&#x27;t quote statistics, I think this may
be the first movie Owen Wilson has been in which has scored and 8+ on
IMDb. To put this bluntly, I&#x27;m not an Owen Wilson fan. I generally
don&#x27;t like his comedy. But in MIP I have never met any other actor who
fits the lead role so perfectly. To put it metaphorically, Owen fits
into MIP like a glove. I have never seen such an flawless
representation of Woody Allen himself. Owen is Woody. And therein lies
the perfection of his acting. He barely needs to act, because I know
all he&#x27;s doing is being himself and dishing out lines given to him, but
it fits so perfect with a Woody image. All in all, MIP is Woody Allen
movie, with a Woody Allen touch, a Woody Allen script, a Woody Allen
cinematography and a Woody Allen leading actor.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t express a very specific audience to which I
would recommend this movie to. If you have been to Paris and loved it,
chances are you will love it. It captures the beauty, the fashion, the
culture and personality of Paris like it really is Paris. However, like
I stated before, the dialogue in this movie and the &#x22;story&#x22; and
&#x22;purpose&#x22; is something which will attract mixed feelings. I, for one,
absolutely loved it. All I can say is that, if you agree with my
comments above or if they touch an emotional nerve, then the chances of
this movie doing the same to you is very high.<br /><br />It is nothing too special. It doesn&#x27;t provide a great message. It
doesn&#x27;t have a extraordinary story. But it provides for a rare kind of
entertainment, coupled with exceptional cinematography and for these
reasons, I cannot give any less than a 10.
