This movie was pretty awful. Woody Allen would obviously have loved to
play the male lead but as he is nearing his dotage he seems to have
made Owen Wilson into a clone of himself. Obviously a problem for Owen
as he in turn tries very hard to be the 21st Century&#x27;s answer to Jimmy
Stewart. The movie as a whole was very predictable with lots of
silliness including time traveling back to the 20s and late 1800s and
being able to pay for dinner/drinks, I would love to see the face of a
1920s waiter when you offered to pay him in Euros! The saving grace was
the shots of Paris and Versailles which I enjoyed. However I think time
for Woody to hang up his directing boots
