Just enough of an intellectual angle to make it interesting, but really
just a fun movie. It&#x27;s fun to think of the what-ifs of meeting the
bygone&#x27;s famous, and to ponder the question: is life really greener on
the other side of the time-continuum? and does everyone of every era
feel this way? I loved the characterizations of past&#x27;s characters --
just the way I&#x27;d pictured them (except maybe Pablo). Marion Cotillard
absolutely devours the camera until there is no camera between you and
her. You are invited into her presence, and it is just her and you and
you are feeling and hearing what the receiving character is hearing and
feeling. She is luminous.<br /><br />Weaknesses: I thought Wilson&#x27;s performance was good, but there was no
reason for him to be in this role other than star-power. Someone else
could have given this role a new dimension, and perhaps the movie a new
dimension as well. Same with McAdam&#x27;s. I think she is a great actress,
but maybe only took this part for a chance to be in a Woody movie. Even
a one dimensional character needs more than one dimension, but still, I
don&#x27;t think the problem here was with her performance, as much as with
casting. Just my opinion.<br /><br />Overall, I liked it very much.
