How this film rankings so high must be a testament to the old Hollywood
marketing engine <br /><br />Loaded with cameos from well know and respected actors. It&#x27;s obvious
they&#x27;re having a good laugh at the audience as they rake in the money
for what is clearly a thin movie. Woody Allen has clearly exhausted his
creativity and snap. A sad moment to witness for what was a great
creative genius. <br /><br />The photography is indeed beautiful with various Paris scenes but the
story plot is weak not only unbelievable but absurd. The primary actors
are miscast and overplay their roles. The cameos are well done but
can&#x27;t save the drowning pool of this movie.
