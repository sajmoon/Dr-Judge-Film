Who wouldn&#x27;t love Paris! Who doesn&#x27;t love fantasy! And if you are in
love with both of them, Midnight in Paris would be the fantasy you
would hate to come out of. And i too felt the same, I never wanted to
come out of the dream I was in, i was sedated with sensuousness walking
along with Owen Wilson through the streets of Paris, meeting eminent
artists whom i always loved to meet, and finally getting someone whom i
could walk in the rain with, talking about everything which I love
about.<br /><br />Woody Allen was never my favorite until i saw &#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22;. Owen
Wilson was cute - I really would like to see more of him in meaty roles
like this rather than in silly romcoms, Marion Cotillard was sweet &#x26;
gorgeous. The casting was too good, that it would be hard to find
anyone misplaced. The music and background score did make the movie
experience merrier. I would love to watch this movie over &#x26; over again,
its hard for me to stay away from this fantasy..
