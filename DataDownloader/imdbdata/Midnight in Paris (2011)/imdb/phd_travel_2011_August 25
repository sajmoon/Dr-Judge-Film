Woody Allen is getting better and better. This is one of his best
preferred it to Vicky Christina and some of the London based ones. All
the historic encounters are so fascintaing it needs to be seen twice to
appreciate all the detail. Makes you want to know more details about
the different people he meets. It&#x27;s one of those movies you wish could
go on longer. Owen is typical Owen I think the role was made for his
laid back charm. Rachel is pretty and hilarious. Such a versatile
actress. The cameo actors are interesting to watch from Brody to a
slightly inexpressive Bruni. It&#x27;s not just about cultural differences,
it&#x27;s about the magical past of the city. My favorite Paris film since
Le Divorce. Can&#x27;t wait to see how Woody handles Rome in his next movie.
