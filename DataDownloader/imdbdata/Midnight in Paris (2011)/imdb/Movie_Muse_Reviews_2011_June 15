Nostalgia. Now that&#x27;s a word not uncommon around a Woody Allen picture.
His films have always oozed of it, and now that his filmmaking legacy
spans more than 40 years, to some people, an Allen film equates to it.
&#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; falls under both categories. Remarkably, only Woody
has been able to riff on the same themes, characters, ideas, etc. for
decades and manage to still churn out thoughtful, funny and
heartwarming pictures (when making a comedy, of course, not one of his
tragedies). Perhaps &#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; derives its warranted praise
and acclaim merely for freshly emulating Allen&#x27;s beloved past work.
Call him a cheater if you like for simply whipping up a new modern
context for the same shtick, but &#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; could charm a
tweed jacket and thick-rimmed spectacles onto almost anyone.<br /><br />A breezy summer romance, &#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; hearkens back to Allen&#x27;s
work in the early-to- mid &#x27;80s with films such as &#x22;Stardust Memories&#x22;
and &#x22;The Purple Rose of Cairo.&#x22; His trademark &#x22;intellectual&#x22; dialogue
functions in the capacity of what purpose it serves rather than a need
to understand what it means, and with exception of main character Gil
Pender (Owen Wilson), all the supporting cast members are role players
in this fairy tale of sorts rather than complex multi-subplot
characters.<br /><br />Gil Pender is your typical
Allen-would&#x27;ve-played-him-had-this-been-30-years-ago protagonist, a
screenwriter manufacturing soulless Hollywood material who hopes that
his planned novel will benefit inspirationally from a city that has
moved so many great artists before him &#x97; Paris. He travels with his
fianc&#xE9;e, Inez (Rachel McAdams), who yearns to learn from Paris the more
practical way and criticizes Gil&#x27;s lack of sociability. While Inez
spends her days learning Paris from uber-intellectual Paul (Michael
Sheen), a caricature of Allen&#x27;s most pretentious characters, Gil takes
to the streets at night for an intangible inspiration. What he finds in
Paris after midnight changes everything, including an alluring young
French woman named Adriana (Marion Cotillard).<br /><br />The only character other than Gil to receive any attention is the city
herself. Paris takes on this amorphous identity as defined by the
characters who perceive it. For Gil, Paris is magic, and as such that&#x27;s
what it becomes for the viewer. As we later come to learn, a city&#x27;s
ability to cradle the history of its impermanent people and absorb
their stories is what constructs its aura. This geographical
timelessness evokes the emotions of those who seek inspiration from
something greater than themselves.<br /><br />Without diving into the details of Gil&#x27;s late-night adventures, Gil
does learn something that challenges his desire to cling to nostalgia.
The challenge of any great writer or artist is to capture and express
the uncomfortable, troubling and intangible void that is the present.
To keep things simple in making this point, the other characters serve
to magnify Gil&#x27;s journey to enlightenment. Even, Inez, who we expect
more from considering McAdams&#x27; ability to turn fluff into substance,
becomes a deplorable and one-sided character quite rapidly. But despite
Inez being written so harshly, she does help convey the fairy tale feel
of the film, which Allen clearly aimed for and struck the bullseye.<br /><br />There&#x27;s definitely a sense that Allen purposefully sidestepped any
serious drama or consequences for Gil&#x27;s actions or those of anyone in
the film, frankly. Knowing Allen&#x27;s capability to add an a powerful
gravity to relationship conflict, it&#x27;s surprising he chooses to
exercise none of it when the film could&#x27;ve been better for it or at
least his ideas more resonant. Instead, he chooses to let the story
float about as this postcard from Paris, one signed with love and
addressed to his fans, those who&#x27;ve pined to recapture the Woody of
old. Yet with impeccable self-awareness as usual, the great filmmaker
adds a postscript in the form of a thematic reminder that dwelling in
the past constitutes nothing but an escape unless we use it to
understand and empower our present. That, of course, is what Woody&#x27;s
done with &#x22;Midnight in Paris.&#x22;<br /><br />~Steven C<br /><br />Visit my site http://moviemusereviews.com
