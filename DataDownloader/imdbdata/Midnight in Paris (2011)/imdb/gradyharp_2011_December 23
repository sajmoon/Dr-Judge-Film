MIDNIGHT IN Paris sounds good on paper and looks in ads. The film opens
with a long sequence of views of the sights in Paris - no actors, no
story, just the breathtaking magnificence of the City of Light. For
this viewer that section i the most rewarding of the entire film. Once
the film starts Woody Allen imposes an improbable story with stereotype
characters and with a few notable exceptions, it gets stuck in its own
cuteness.<br /><br />VERY briefly screenwriter wannabe novelist Gil (Owen Wilson playing
Owen Wilson) and his bride to be Inez (Rachel McAdams) are in Paris
with Inez&#x27; parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy) who in turn are on a
business trip. Inez is a bore: Gil wants adventure. As Inez sees the
touristy places with her friends, the hideously boring pedantic Paul
(Michael Sheen) and his flaky partner Carol (Nina Arianda), Gil escapes
to walk the streets of Paris and fall in love with the history and the
magic of the city. At the stoke of midnight he is picked up by an
elegant car and is taken to the 1920s where he encounters Cole Porter
(Yves Heck), Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll), F Scott Fitzgerald (Tom
Hiddleston) and his Zelda (Allison Pill), Josephine Baker (Sonia
Rolland), Alice B. Toklas (Th&#xE9;r&#xE8;se Bourou-Rubinsztein) and Gertrude
Stein (Kathy Bates), Picasso (Marcial Di Fonzo Bo) and his current
flame Adriana (Marion Cotillard who seems to have phoned in her
performance), Djuna Barnes (Emmanelle Uzan), Salvador Dal&#xED; (Adrien
Brody - in probably the only convincing performance in the film), Man
Ray (Tom Cordier), Luis Bu&#xF1;uel (Adrien de Van), TS Eliot (David Lowe) -
in other words all the famous artists of the 1920s. Gil is captivated
by the opportunity to share his work with these greats, though he finds
it difficult to understand time travel. He falls for Adriana who in
turn wishes she could live in the time of Le Belle Epoque so of course
Gil and Adriana time travel again meeting Henri Matisse (Yves-Antoine
Spoto), Toulesse-Lautrec (Vincent Menjou Cortes), Paul Gauguin (Olivier
Rabourdin), and Edgar Degas (Fran&#xE7;ois Rostain) at Maxim&#x27;s. Gil by day
grows less enamored with Inez and by night more infatuated by Adriana
and in the end there is a permanent schism between Gil and Inez and we
are left with the moral &#x27;Don&#x27;t wish to live in another time than your
own.&#x27;<br /><br />Sounds like a run through of famous names? It is. Wilson is inept at
romantic comedy, and Woody Allen&#x27;s script is fairly boring for Allen&#x27;s
works. BUT Paris is Gorgeous - and that is enough! <br /><br />Grady Harp
