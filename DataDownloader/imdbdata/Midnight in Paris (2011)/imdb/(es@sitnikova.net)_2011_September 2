As a big Woody Allen fan I haven&#x27;t missed any of his releases of the
past 10 years, however I must admit that some of his recent works have
failed to impress me.<br /><br />It is a completely different story with this one - mesmerizing and
magic, inspiring and inspirational, sad and happy, charming and
breathtaking - it is all of those and more. My only regret is that I
have waited so long since its release to watch it! Owen Wilson is
absolutely brilliant in the role and Adrian Broody as Salvador Dali
deserves a special mention.<br /><br />Mr Allen, that deserves a major round of applause. Thank you.
