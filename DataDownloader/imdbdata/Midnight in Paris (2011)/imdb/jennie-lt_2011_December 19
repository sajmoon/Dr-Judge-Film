If you don&#x27;t know some of the historic icons that deeply influenced art
and literature of our decade like Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway, Cole
Porter, or Gertrude Stein. . . than it really doesn&#x27;t matter. . . much.
To be honest I have not heard of half the characters in the film, i&#x27;m
not a literature junkie nor had i read any of their works in class, so
it was a bit hard to follow Gil&#x27;s state of astonishment when he met
them. I do however love Woody Allen&#x27;s films and this film is definitely
worth seeing. <br /><br />I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve read the synopsis and the movie is so much more than
that! I won&#x27;t include spoilers, but a hint: after midnight is when the
magic really starts happening. The film transports you to another time,
specifically the 1920s in Paris, and it is amazing. I am dying to go to
Paris after this movie because you really fall in love with the city.
The film showcases the best parts of Paris with great acting from Owen
Wilson, Marion Cotillard, and surprisingly Rachel McAdams. (I did not
like McAdam&#x27;s character in this movie but she did it nicely, a more
annoying version of Regina from Mean Girls)The actors that played the
Fitzgeralds were amazing, Alison Pill and Tom Hiddleston, though i
don&#x27;t know how they really acted but it was a good interpretation.
After seeing the characters you really understand Gil&#x27;s fascination to
learn more from them and just hang out with them. This movie has been a
great nostalgic learning experience and it&#x27;s something that I highly
recommend to every romantic out there. Cole Porter&#x27;s &#x22; Let&#x27;s do it,
let&#x27;s fall in love&#x22; is now my theme song. <br /><br />Midnight in Paris made me fall in love with old records, inspired me to
read the Great Gatsby and I admire Woody Allen even more. It&#x27;s a
definite must watch of the year.
