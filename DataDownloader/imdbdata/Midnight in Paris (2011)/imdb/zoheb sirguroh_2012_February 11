The Moment the reel starts rolling,what you are transported into are
the various exotic and picturesque locations of a city whose streets
and boulevards are nothing but an art form.In those 2 minutes at the
start of the film,you yearn for a visit to one of the world&#x27;s most
beautiful cities. The film is about a Hollywood writer Gill (Owen
Wilson) who has come for a business trip with his fianc&#xE9; Inez&#x27;s( Rachel
McAdams) family in Paris.Gill has decided to become a full-fledged
writer and has even written a manuscript of his 400 page novel.Gill has
been mesmerized by the beauty of Paris and persuades Inez to settle
their lives in this city which inspires Gill as a writer.However,Inez
is reluctant and prefers Malibu over Paris.Gill and Inez chance upon
Paul( Michael Sheen) who was a college buddy and crush of Inez.The
affinity of Inez for Paul obviously irritates Gill.Nobody considers his
decision seriously and Gill is one day alone in the midnight of Paris.
What happens that night and it&#x27;s further implications carry on the
brilliant,fast-paced narrative of this film.It boasts of brilliant
actors like Marion Cottilard,Corey Stoll and Tom Hiddleston.It brings
into life the 1920s Paris and the great artists like Scott
Fitzgerald,Pablo Picasso,Ernest Hemmingway and many others.The
performances of all the actors are top-notch especially Corey Stoll as
Ernest Hemmingway.He will have rolling on the floor with laughter in a
couple of scenes. After seeing her momentary appearance as Irene Adler
in the Game of Shadows,Rachel McAdams is a delight in this film.And it
seems that Owen Wilson plays excellent roles as a writer.&#x22;Marley and
Me&#x22; and this film are testimonials of this fact.Marion Cottilard is as
gorgeous and fantastic as a performer as usual. Woody Allen has not
only done excellent Direction,but has written a fascinating original
screenplay and gem of a dialogues.The narrative of the film is a
natural flow and the dialogues are one that will be remembered in years
to come. The cinematography is exceptionally well and the art direction
is successful at bringing the 1920&#x27;s Paris alive apart from the
wonderful locations. The music is brilliant.In fact,&#x22;The Let&#x27;s Fall in
Love&#x22; track takes the story further. There are just a few flaws in the
film.The main flaw is an abrupt end though satisfying.The chemistry
between Paul and Ineza is left to our imagination though Gill and
Ineza&#x27;s is brilliantly executed.Rachel McAdams and Owen Wison gel much
better than Wedding Crashers here.However,the friction between the two
is again left to our imagination.Carla Bruni&#x27;s appearance as the Museum
guide is pitiable.France&#x27;s first lady has been completely wasted in
this one.And then there is this notorious habit of Woody Allen.His
camera lazes around the butt of his main female characters.The constant
indirect implied focus on Rachel Mcadams butt is completely uncalled
for.Another flaw is that you have to be well aversed with English
literature to understand the characters.This is for avid
readers,writers and novel enthusiasts. Finally,Woody Allen has again
given a visual and intellectually stimulating treat.In fact,you will be
forced to Google the famous personalities portrayed in the film after
watching it.Luckily,I did know most of them while watching the
film.Just a couple were unknown to me and I just googled them later.But
then,it didn&#x27;t take away from the main plot of the film.This film is
way better than Allen&#x27;s last successful work in 2009,Vicky Cristina
Barcelona.It has already been nominated for four Golden Globes.This
hilarious,romantic comedy won the best original screenplay in the
Critics Choice Awards and now I see that it well deserved it. It&#x27;s a
very good film.I will go with 7.5/10 or 3.5/5 on this one.A must-watch
of 2011.Enjoy! =)
