Woody Allen&#x27;s 2011 contribution to cinema has been heralded as a return
to form by many critics, and for a few shining moments at the outset,
it looks like it might just as well be that way. Through a lovely
montage of Parisian images by cinematographer Darius Khondji, Allen
evokes the city&#x27;s unabashed romanticism set to Sidney Bechet&#x27;s
nocturnally soulful saxophone on his composition &#x22;Si Tu Vois Ma Mere&#x22;
much the same way the filmmaker captured the cosmopolitan energy of
Manhattan set to Gershwin&#x27;s grandiose &#x22;Rhapsody in Blue&#x22; in his 1979
masterwork. The camera finally lands on the lead characters as they
visit Claude Monet&#x27;s picture-perfect gardens at Giverny. From there,
Allen treads familiar territory following the adventures of Gil Pender,
Allen&#x27;s alter-ego, a successful but unfulfilled Hollywood screenwriter
on a trip to Paris with his fianc&#xE9;e Inez along with her wealthy,
xenophobic parents who are funding the trip with typical bourgeoisie
disdain.<br /><br />Longing to join the literary ranks of his heroes F. Scott Fitzgerald
and Ernest Hemingway, Gil, we discover, is working on his first novel
much to Inez&#x27;s chagrin. Enamored with the way Paris was during the
1920&#x27;s, Gil soon finds himself in an alternate universe after midnight
where he is rubbing elbows over martinis at jazz clubs with not only
Fitzgerald and Hemingway but also influential figures like Gertrude
Stein, Pablo Picasso, Cole Porter, and Salvador Dali. By the light of
day, however, he faces the mundane reality of Inez and her family, who
are completely indifferent to his flights of fancy. Matters get worse
when Gil and Inez bump into Paul, an old college crush of hers, who has
since become the type of intolerable pedant Allen skewered so well in
the movie theater scene in &#x22;Annie Hall&#x22;. Gil &#x96; as he toggles between
present-day Paris and his idealized vision of the city&#x27;s past - will
likely remind Allen&#x27;s fans of the shenanigans that occurred in &#x22;The
Purple Rose of Cairo&#x22; down to the introduction of an out-of-sync love
interest, this time a beautiful clothing designer named Adriana, who
was Modigliani&#x27;s mistress and has now become Picasso&#x27;s embattled lover.
Allen obviously enjoys regaling in Jazz Age-era Paris and presumes his
viewers will have more than a passing familiarity with the period.<br /><br />Thankfully, I just saw the Steins Collect at the San Francisco Museum
of Modern Art, so I received a primer on some of these seminal figures.
You can tell Allen is less interested in the contemporary scenes, which
are not as arresting with these characters coming across more like
stereotypes despite a game cast. As the hapless Gil, Owen Wilson is a
bit improbable as a writer with high literary aspirations, but his
sincerity in the role helps win us over. Back in &#x22;Mean Girls&#x22; mode,
Rachel McAdams isn&#x27;t given that much to do as Inez except to express
constant frustration. Usually playing sincere historical figures like
Tony Blair and David Frost, Michael Sheen has a field day as the
entirely unlikeable Paul. There&#x27;s a predictably no-nonsense turn by
Kathy Bates as Stein and an over-the-top one by Adrian Brody as Dali.
As Scott and Zelda, Tom Hiddleston (the malevolent Loki in &#x22;Thor&#x22;) and
especially Alison Pill play their archetypes quite well, but among the
real-life figures, Corey Stoll stands out as the pugnacious Hemingway.
As Adriana, Marion Cotillard makes the most of her fantasy figure role.
All in all, this is solid work from Allen but still a fair distance
from his most accomplished.
