Woody Allen&#x27;s latest film might be his most entertaining and rewarding
ever. Midnight in Paris is hardly new material for Allen. Many people
have long accused him of recycling old ideas. At the same time, Allen&#x27;s
newest creation touches on familiar ground but still seems refreshing
all the same.<br /><br />Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) is a successful Hollywood screenwriter
spending some free time with his fianc&#xE9;e Inez (Rachal McAdams) in the
French capital. They too are a classic mismatched couple familiar to
Allen fans. Gil an aspiring novelist hopes the inspiration of Paris
will help him complete his first novel. Inez on the other hand is
content spending time shopping and dancing with a &#x27;pedantic&#x27; old flame
named Paul played by Michael Sheen.<br /><br />Gil believes that he is wasting his talent at screen writing and dreams
up a story revolving around a nostalgic shop. He is particularly
fascinated with Paris in the 1920s when it was home to many great
artists, poets, writers and even filmmakers of that time. Michael
Sheen&#x27;s character Paul refers to it as &#x27;golden age thinking,&#x27; that your
personality is best suited in a specific time frame of the past.<br /><br />The film explores the idea that many people think that their lives
would be easier or more fruitful if they had been born at another time.
But in reality the people of any so called golden age likely long for a
different time frame. It is mostly found in people with a deep
intellectual curiosity. Perhaps the idea is erroneous like Paul says.
But Woody Allen&#x27;s film seems to say,&#x27;So what?&#x27; Perhaps it is not the
allure of Paris in the 1920s that is so engrossing Allen. Perhaps it is
the bleak pessimism of the present that is so troubling to Allen. Gil&#x27;s
materialistic fianc&#xE9;e, her right wing Republican parents and the
pretentious pseudo-intellectual played by Martin Sheen are clearly
archetypes of people in his own time.<br /><br />Midnight in Paris is typical of many Allen films. There are bad
romances. There are true romances that could never be fulfilled. This
film is not as multi-layered as Annie Hall and Manhattan, widely held
to be his best work. But you will not care.<br /><br />You will not really care to know why exactly he is picked up at the
same corner of Paris by a classic Peugeot every night at midnight
either. Midnight in Paris might just be the most entertaining Allen
film ever. It is as mesmerizing and full of charm as the people he
meets in his adventures.
