Oh dear. I know democracy is good, is something positive even if not
perfect. Nevertheless, when I see here all the shinning comments about
this abnormal movie I just want to putsh over IMDb and play Pinochet
for a while until all those stars are wiped out for good.<br /><br />Woody, Woody, Woody... not even your genius, not even your brilliant
direction can save this aberration. Why to take part in such a stupid
project? Please, I want to know why??? I demand to know!<br /><br />Absolutely below all B movie standards. They probably thought &#x22;let&#x27;s
mix Woody with some pretty faces and asses and with some crazy
directing moves and we got ourselves a movie&#x22;. Instead, what Woody got
was something to throw in the nearest trash bin. What he got was a
complete failure, a mess without plot, without actors, without ideas,
without consistence. What he did was to copy the traditional teen
romance movie already seen ten thousand times before, arrange some
fancy scenarios with lots of dolls, kidnap Rachel McAdams until Owen
Wilber agreed to jump into the project and VOIL&#xC1;! You got yourself the
bullshit movie of the year.<br /><br />Avoid this movie with all your strengths, even if you adore Woody
Allen, like me.
