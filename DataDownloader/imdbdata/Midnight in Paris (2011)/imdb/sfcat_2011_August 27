So, actually, I HATE Woody Allen films. just saying his name makes me
groan and roll my eyes. But I was taking my dad out for his birthday,
so we went. And a darn good thing too! The movie was lovely! Owen
Wilson was excellent in his role as a successful writer struggling to
change, and being too passive- or spineless- to do what he needed to
do. The family characters are a little one dimensional, but the heart
of the movie isn&#x27;t about them, but rather the amazing place he finds on
his walks at midnight. I was totally caught up in the fiction, and the
atmosphere was perfect.<br /><br />Still hate Allen, but the movie was amazing.
