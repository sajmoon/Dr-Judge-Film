I always want to like Woody Allen&#x27;s films. Unfortunately, a lot of
time, I&#x27;m disappointed. If I trace back the roots of this
disappointment, I find that it is tied to the vague endings that seem
to recall the attempts at being &#x27;artistic&#x27; that characterized films of
the 1970s. Woody Allen became enamored with this approach in his 1979
film, Manhattan. Okay, I admit, life sometimes gives us vague endings,
but if you&#x27;re going to tell a story, then give us the ending to it.
It&#x27;s like having a joke without a punchline, and remember, Woody Allen
got his start as a stand-up comedian. Say what you will about Woody
Allen, but he is a good story teller.<br /><br />And this is a good story. Yes, of course, you can delve into the
problems of time travel, but that&#x27;s not the point. Why waste your time?
True, the characters may have been caricatures, but that&#x27;s half the fun
of it. Because when Woody Allen is at his best, his movies combine
humor and truth. The relationships may seem exaggerated at times, but I
challenge anyone to find that they don&#x27;t contain an uncomfortable grain
of this truth.<br /><br />Owen Wilson does a credible job and I suspect he could handle more
challenging roles than he is usually given. In fact, I had no problem
finding any of the characters believable. All in all, it was a very
satisfying film to watch.
