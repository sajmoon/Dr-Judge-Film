If nebbish nerdy males and female partners who are shallow,
self-absorbed, and clueless strike your fancy, you obviously enjoy
films by Woody Allen. This is so much in the recycled Allen genre that
it does not warrant anything other than a nod to great Paris locations
and period costumes. Always a fan of period jazz, this film does not
disappoint either, but Cole Porter was done a few years ago with Kevin
Klein, so &#x22;Let&#x27;s Fall In Love&#x22; doesn&#x27;t have the unexpected flashback.
Even the introduction of La Belle Epoque, Maxim&#x27;s and the Moulin Rouge
with Lautrec, Gaugin and Degas, to Piccaso, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Dali,
Man Ray, and Gertrude Stein is nostalgia light. Allen&#x27;s retro-vision of
the past is still too convenient, too clean, too &#x22;golden&#x22; to hold
attention, or even want to invest a second viewing.<br /><br />Performances of Kathy Bates as third-eye Gertrude Stein and Marion
Cotillard are marvelous, but this is more a walking man&#x27;s tour of the
Paris cityscape than a story which hold the interest to the end, and is
ultimately formulaic and predictable. Equitable in irritation are the
performances of Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams as the mismatched couple
whose relationship is brought asunder by the city of romance and
lights. Sorry Woody lovers but other films are more intriguing at this
time.
