No one knows the American character like Allen, no one manages to bring
it on screen like him either. This film is his best, there are way too
many layers to bring everything here because there are several stories
going on and the audience can pick and choose which one they will
follow. They can be the American tourists in Paris &#x22;getting some art&#x22;
and shopping and consequently follow the little love story Allen has
utilized to tell his bigger story &#x96; that of Western thought and the
role of literature in Western civilization. Sad that one has to add
glitter to a film to convey a more meaningful story &#x96; but in this case
his managed it well in that it doesn&#x27;t take over the story. Nostalgia
is one of the central themes of the movie as something that Allen has
been consumed with always but now he manages to peal the onion more
academically by bringing in authorities in the field who he identifies
with from Hemingway (who he trivializes a little with his American
bravado) to Gertrude Stein &#x96; all of whom give their 2 cents on
nostalgia, life, art and existence in the terms that Allen has been
obsessing throughout his career. Why would anyone give this film less
than maximum points is beyond me, not because Allen is the greatest
living American thinker but because no other film, at least in the last
few years, has managed to capture what 21st century humans have become
in the context of time&#x85;neurotic, anxious and superficial.
