This movie is a whimsical fantasy that succeeds as a movie. The main
character, admirably played by Owen Wilson, is on a quest for something
that is a mirage, but to him is real. The movie deals with escapism and
its pitfalls. Yes, it can be fun to let our imagination take us to all
the beautiful places we crave to go to for happiness, but ultimately
we&#x27;re stuck in the present which sooner or later comes back to bite us.
Nevertheless, the world of make believe can seem so real that once
you&#x27;re there, you never want to leave and that is the start of madness.
This movie takes the audience to the brink of madness. The main
character is so open to suggestion and so desperate to be appreciated
and understood that he wants to flee present, which makes this movie so
appealing. For who doesn&#x27;t think about wanting to escape to a better
place? Who doesn&#x27;t daydream? The rest of the cast is excellent. As for
the cinematography, the opening shots of Paris are superb. Rarely has
an urban setting been more magnificently presented in a movie and for
those who like Paris, this movie will be a delight to watch.
