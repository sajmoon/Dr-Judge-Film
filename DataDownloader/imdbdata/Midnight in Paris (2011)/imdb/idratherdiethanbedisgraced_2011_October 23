Being a Woody Allen film, I entered this film with high expectations.
The beautiful cinematic beginning set the tone for this movie, with
about 3 minutes of beautiful music set to a back drop of the lovely
Parisian streets. The start set the tone for the relaxing yet
thoroughly engaging film, that enabled us to view he wonders of Paris,
that artists were privy to in the 1920s. The casting of Owen Wilson as
the main protagonist was wonderful, and he was able to redeem himself
for atrocity that was Hall Pass. His relaxed and &#x27;take it as it comes&#x27;
demeanor set the tone for the movie, and the casting of Rachel McAdams,
as the beautiful, yet extremely materialistic and self absorbed wife
made Wilson&#x27;s characters desire to move to Paris understandable.<br /><br />The introduction of the famous artists, that included Hemingway,
Picasso, T.S Elliot, and Scott and Zelda Fitzpatrick was remarkably
done. It was obvious that, Allen respected the audiences literary
knowledge, by not introducing the background to the characters, but
instead, slowing including their subtle nuances, which provided many
laughs, especially that Picasso&#x27;s erratic nature.<br /><br />Marion Cottilard was once again brilliant, as the beautiful and
enticing mistress of Picasso. The on screen chemistry between Wilson
and Cottilard was a redeeming quality throughout.<br /><br />The only negative thing I could say about this movie, is that it seemed
to finish with too many stories unanswered. The movie thoroughly
deserves its 8.0 rating as it is beautiful directed and written.
