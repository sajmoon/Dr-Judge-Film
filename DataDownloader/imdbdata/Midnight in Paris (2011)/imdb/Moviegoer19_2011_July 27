What a fantasy! Hiding in the dark of night on a round Paris stoop when
the bells ring Midnight; an antique car (identified as a Peugot) pulls
up out of a dark winding street and pulls you in and takes you back in

passing interest in art, and writing in particular, will just eat this
up and savor it. I just LOVED this movie and cannot wait to see it
again.
