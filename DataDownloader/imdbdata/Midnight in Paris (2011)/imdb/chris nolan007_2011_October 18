Human being has a nature that he can&#x27;t satisfy himself at any
condition. When a man think that there&#x27;s something missing in his world
than there&#x27;s always an unexpected event waiting down for him to change
his course of life. <br /><br />MIDNIGHT IN Paris is a simple story of a man named Gil(Owen Wilson) who
thought that his Hollywood world is not that quiet exciting and not
fulfilling his writer skills as he wanted to write novels. Than he gets
the chance to go to Paris with his beautiful girlfriend(Rachel McAdams)
and her family for a business trip. He always knew that Paris is the
land of LOVE and ART but he felt that when he encountered that place.
Beautiful views of streets, rivers, lamps, landmarks etc makes
protagonist fall in love with Paris. He decides to stay here forever
but not everyone feel good about that. His great love for Paris leads
him to some beautiful illusions which in the end makes him realize that
this is what he was missing in his life i.e. ART and LOVE.<br /><br />Allen&#x27;s cinematographers never compromised to show how beautiful Paris
is, every single view into the screen is in detailed form and showed
with spectacular camera work. Especially the ending scene when Eiffel
Tower was lightning beautifully. <br /><br />Whole screenplay is one the best part of the movie. Exciting Story-line
helps to meet some of the beautiful characters who keeps us engaged
till the end. Dialogues are good and written very well keeping a view
of French-France in mind.<br /><br />As expected, all the performers are superb. From leading actor Wilson
to supporting actor Adrien Brody all are superb. Special remarks for
Marion Cotillard, she is looking so beautiful and stealing every second
she is on the screen.<br /><br />First movie of the year which i felt is Technically natural. Filmed in
old fashioned style which is refreshingly cool. U have never seen Paris
that beautiful in any past Hollywood films. Movie takes place in my
year&#x27;s top 5. With Wonderful direction of the great Woody Allen and
comical-adventurous journey of Paris this movie deserves 10/10. Must
watch for those who respect and love ART.
