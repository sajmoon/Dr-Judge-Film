The trailer for Midnight In Paris is so deceiving, I saw the trailer
and thought oh great another film about Paris, the city everyone but me
seems to love, but the when I sat down to watch it I was so pleasantly
surprised at just how different this movie is to what you would expect.<br /><br />Firstly I have to say that the story of a man traveling to another era
after midnight is terribly clever, it took me a second to realize that
the main character has actually time traveled and hasn&#x27;t just run into
people who are dressed in 20&#x27;s attire for the evening. It&#x27;s even
different to the usual Woody Allen material, it&#x27;s highly original in
every way imaginable.<br /><br />The cast in this movie is exceptional, I&#x27;m not usually an Owen Wilson
fan but I found him wonderfully likable, he is so at home in this type
of film, it&#x27;s nice to see him in an intelligent comedy and not a cheap
silly one. The entire supporting cast are wonderful, Rachel McAdams
playing against character is great at making you dislike her character
almost instantly, the same can be said for Michael Sheen, the 2
supporting cast members who were the best were Alison Pill as Zelda
Fitzgerald, she&#x27;s hilarious and just plain fantastic, Marion Cotillard
is lovely and sweet as well, all of them are great, they all get a
great scene, another worth mentioning is Adrian Brody as Dali, another
hilarious encounter. Woody Allen sure knows how to write fir all his
characters, no one is left unmemorable.<br /><br />It&#x27;s kinda hard not to like this movie, I loved it in every way, I hope
you will too. The best Woody Allen film since Match Point. :)
