As embarrassed as I am to say this, this is the first Woody Allen movie
I have ever viewed. I have heard numerous amounts of good things about
his work and his directing, and his originality. I never really had an
interest in seeing this movie when it came to theaters, despite all of
the positive comments about the movie, but when it was nominated for
Best Picture I immediately added it to my Netflix list. I wasn&#x27;t sure
what to expect, but, I knew it was Woody Allen so I was pretty excited
to view this movie, even though I had no idea what the movie was about.
Boy, I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />First of all, the movie is about Gil (Owen Wilson) and Inez (Rachel
McAdams) on a trip to Paris before their wedding. Despite Inez&#x27;s rude
comments that made me just wanna scream at her, Gil tries to be the
best he can be to her, and that&#x27;s frustrating. So one night, he goes
wandering through the streets of Paris, and ends up getting lost. He&#x27;s
sitting on a flight of stairs, in the middle of nowhere, and when the
clock strikes midnight, a car comes and takes him on a little adventure
that sparks the plot of the whole movie. Along with Wilson and McAdams,
there are some special appearances from Kathy Bates, Adrien Brody, etc.
etc. This makes the movie even more enjoyable.<br /><br />The big reason why I love this movie is the originality to it. That&#x27;s
always a huge bonus to me when I watch a movie, is it original? I don&#x27;t
want some love story that&#x27;s been done twenty times to a point that it&#x27;s
just a clich&#xE9; in Hollywood. This movie is definitely original, and
right from the get-go I was very satisfied in the movie before I was
even thirty minutes in. A lot of the movies nowadays, and I&#x27;m sure
you&#x27;ve heard people say this over and over, lack originality. There are
a lot of retreads, sequels, and remakes. This movie, in no way, shape,
or form, represents another movie of any kind. And I loved that fact,
it just made me enjoy this film ten times more. All in all, I think
this movie well-deserves the Best Original Screenplay Oscar.<br /><br />Woody Allen has crafted a beautiful movie packed with amazing scenes
played off very well by the actors. The writing and directing is just
completely amazing. The whole movie is amazing, right from the
beginning, with the montage of Paris, to the very surprising, but not
unsatisfying, ending. I highly recommend this movie to anybody he
enjoys a good time in front of your TV, and who appreciates a good
movie when they see one.<br /><br />9/10
