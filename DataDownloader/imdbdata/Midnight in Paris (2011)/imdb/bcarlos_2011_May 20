Midnight In Paris follows a young writer in a visit to Paris with his
fianc&#xE9;e where he travels all nights ninety years back in time to get
advise and friendship from the literary geniuses of the time. Yes, it&#x27;s
another film from Woody Allen, but this time is not as routinary as You
Will Meet A Tall Dark Stranger or as cheeky as Vicky Cristina
Barcelona. This shows Woody Allen at the standard he should be at every
year. Original, funny, engaging and with some light meaningful message
that we all relate to; what else can you ask from a film?<br /><br />The colors and cinematography of the film are more of the same of the
post-Barcelona Allen, all beige and brownish, but he achieves a beauty
in his portrayal of Paris that has not come from him since he first
visited London with Match Point in 2005. It&#x27;s also the most original
screenplay he has written since, and the plot works and looks like one
of his short stories, as a crazy, illogic and absurd showcase of gags
and jokes.<br /><br />The performances are all fine, nothing stellar though, except for
Adrien Brody&#x27;s magnificent role as Salvador Dal&#xED;. Owen Wilson does a
very good job but he tries too much to be and act like Woody Allen. The
impersonations are all great -Hemingway,Picasso, Bu&#xF1;uel, Fitzgerald-
they all look exactly the same than in real life.<br /><br />This is a film that will surely not disappoint any moviegoer or Allen
fan. It&#x27;s true that it doesn&#x27;t come close to other of his better films,
but it is a step forward from Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Cassandra&#x27;s
Dream, You Will Meet... and even Scoop and Whatever Works. Still, if
you want to enjoy some true Woody Allen, go and see Annie Hall, Hannah
And Her Sisters, Crimes And Misdemeanors, etc. This is not anything
brilliant, but it is very entertaining, amusing and original; and it
its a great time spent at the movies.<br /><br />Midnight In Paris is a surreal and touristic romantic comedy with
clever comical gags, a creative story and a beautiful portrayal of the
City of Lights.<br /><br />Rating: 3.5/5.
