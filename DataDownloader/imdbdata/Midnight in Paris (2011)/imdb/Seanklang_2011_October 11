I had my own Woody Allen &#x27;moment&#x27; when going to see this movie early in
the afternoon. I arrived 30 seconds late &#x96; I always try to avoid the
ads &#x96; and in the darkness mistook an elderly gentleman&#x27;s groin for the
arm of my seat &#x96; twice! He did&#x27;nt complain the first time so I assumed
I must be in the right place. I groped my way to the seat in front of
him whispering apologies along the way and sat while the cinematic sun
rose. I left delighted at having seen - at long last &#x96; a marvellous new
film from Mr.Allen, delighted also at not having been jumped or beaten
up. <br /><br />I think it would be pedantic to fault historical inaccuracies regarding
the authors or painters encountered by Owen Wilson&#x27;s character,
begrudging to deny the pleasure of the turns given by Cotillard, Brody,
and others, and simply mean to ignore the love and intelligence
involved in the making of this film &#x96; that magic we recognise from
Annie Hall, through The Purple Rose of Cairo, to Deconstucting Harry.
Because this film, after all the dross since those great Allen films
that we admire (I assume) , has that quality that would (as somebody
said) &#x27;send you&#x27;.... And that&#x27;s all this film tries to be about,
sending, or &#x27;transporting&#x27; you &#x96; us. It&#x27;s marvellous. <br /><br />I&#x27;ll probably go and see it again, though I&#x27;ll arrive a little earlier
next time!
