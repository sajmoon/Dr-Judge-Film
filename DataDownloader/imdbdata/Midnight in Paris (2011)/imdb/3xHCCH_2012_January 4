When I first heard the lead character of &#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; talk, I
thought it was Woody Allen talking. But when I looked at the screen, I
saw Owen Wilson! I do not know if Owen was purposely doing it, but he
was channeling Woody Allen perfectly in intonation and diction. Maybe
it was the characteristic style Woody Allen wrote his script, I don&#x27;t
know but it was so uncanny and this added to my enjoyment of this film.<br /><br />&#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; is about a movie scriptwriter and struggling
novelist Gil (Owen Wilson) who was trapped in a stifling relationship
with his snooty fianc&#xE9;e Inez (Rachel Mc Adams). This becomes more
evident during their supposedly romantic vacation in Paris, when Inez
spending more time with her snobbish parents and her &#x22;pseudo-
intellectual pedantic&#x22; male friend Paul (Michael Sheen). To escape, Gil
takes a midnight walk in the side streets of Paris, and was magically
transported to the 1920s where he encounters his literary heroes like
Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll), and Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates). He
also meets and falls in love with Pablo Picasso&#x27;s muse Adriana (Marion
Cotillard). How Gil faces and resolves this unusual situation is the
unique premise of this delightful little Woody Allen masterpiece.<br /><br />&#x22;Midnight in Paris&#x22; is a very charming movie. It is about yearning for
something much better than what you have now. It had me from the get-
go, very interesting right away. The initial five minutes of beautiful
Parisian scenes and music will put you in the proper mood right away
and never let you go. People who loves literature and the arts will
certainly share Gil&#x27;s excitement and fascination about actually meeting
these authors in the flesh. Cameos by Dali (a funny turn by Adrien
Brody), Fitzgerald, Bunuel, Matisse, and even Toulouse-Lautrec, Degas
and Gauguin further add to the nostalgia. I have some quibbles only
about Gil finding Adriana&#x27;s book, but that is minor. Only Woody Allen
can make an off-the-wall movie like this and get away with it! A
definite must-watch!
