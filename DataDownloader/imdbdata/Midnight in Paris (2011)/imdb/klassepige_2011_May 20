Quite a lot of great lines carrying life&#x27;s wisdom; Profound reflection
and insight of living the precious present expressed in a light-hearted
touch! If you have your own &#x27;Golden Age&#x27; fantasy, you will likely enjoy
it. This movie seems to be relatively more straightforward in
communicating its message than some of Allen&#x27;s other works, such as
&#x22;You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger.&#x22; As a plus, lovely cinematography
of the city of Paris - Mr. Allen has apparently fallen in love with the
&#x27;good old (and charming)&#x27; European major cities; e.g., London, Paris,
Barcelona and etc. Very likely, you will leave the movie theater with a
big and warm smile on your face...
