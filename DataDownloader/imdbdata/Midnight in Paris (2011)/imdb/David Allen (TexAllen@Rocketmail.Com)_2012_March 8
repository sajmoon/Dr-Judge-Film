The following are comments about &#x22;Midnight In Paris&#x22; (2011) and also
(at the end of the comments) a brief memory of a time I met Woody Allen
personally.... from Tex Allen, SAG Actor.<br /><br />--------------------<br /><br />The &#x22;Midnight In Paris&#x22; (2011) movie is OK and interesting many
ways....movie making is very hard work, and Woody obviously went easy
on himself and the actors part of th movie....took a lot of
short-cuts....how to make movies at age 76 and not die from overwork,
it appears!<br /><br />The main character gets into a time warp and goes back to both the
1920&#x27;s and the 1890&#x27;s and talks with celebrities in Paris during those
two periods...quite a WHO&#x27;S WHO laundry list of famous people...maybe 2
dozen of them.<br /><br />Nice photography of present day Paris, too, which is very clean, clean,
clean and so scrubbed is lacks charm in contrast to older movie
depictions of Paris when it&#x27;s charming (AMERICAN IN Paris [1951],
etc.).<br /><br />The actors improvise a lot, and Woody&#x27;s script has about 3 very good
short sections with memorable writing, etc.<br /><br />The movie is no classic, but not bad, either. Young Owen Wilson has the
lead role, plays the part of a writer with girlfriend problems and job
problems...all comic ones...same as Woody when he used to star in his
own movies.<br /><br />Documentary part of the DVD I got shows Woody at a press conference in
2011 at Cannes, and his looks very fragile and unhealthy...his skin is
very yellow and pasty looking, and one eye looks bad, like a man who
had a stroke...and his speech isn&#x27;t clear at times......but...he keeps
on going like old man river.<br /><br />He really is one of the great figures in cinema....like D. W. Griffith,
I think. I met him face to face in NYC in 1972 at a place where he
played his clarinet several times weekly with the house jazz
band...called &#x22;Michael&#x27;s Pub&#x22; as I remember. I was living in Manhattan
then, selling educational movies....had a jazzy apt. in the easy 60&#x27;s
near the place where Woody played...went to see him one afternoon with
a girlfriend who knew about it. He talked about the Mets baseball team.<br /><br />Woody is very important...made 41 films since TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN in
1968...... Woody made that movie in SF CALIF on almost no money!
