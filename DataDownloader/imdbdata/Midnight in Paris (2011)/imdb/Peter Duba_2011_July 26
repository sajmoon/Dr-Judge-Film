Liked it a lot more than I thought I would as I am not really a Woody
Allen fan (probably a generation thing). <br /><br />The performance of Owen Wilson was most amusing as he plays in very
much the same way as Woody Allen would (I even though for a moment that
Owen Wilson is an anagram of Woody Allen, but it is not). <br /><br />Paris decor of the film is shown through the eyes of a foreign fan of
the city - which is not at all disturbing in case you are a foreign fan
of the city; there was only one place I did not recognise (the flea
market where Gil found the Cole Porter record). <br /><br />Overall, great acting, agreeably and continually humorous scenes and a
very nice evening spent.
