This movie was a very nice film to enjoy on a Saturday night. If you&#x27;re
watching this movie at home, I would suggest closing the shutters and
the lights in order to add to the experience of midnight in Paris. This
movie was a pleasure to watch, and I enjoyed a lot about it. I think
that overall it was well-made and the picture was very well done, with
really beautiful scenery of Paris and Parisian customs and all of that
kind of lifestyle. The script was also very nice, except I would
recommend adding more emphasis on the moral of the movie, that life is
not necessarily better elsewhere. The movie did touch upon that moral
when Gil was talking to Adriana near the end of the film. I felt that
the ending of the movie could have been completed more thoroughly than
it was. However, other than that, the script was quite captivating, and
though I expected it to be a little boring, it was not at all! <br /><br />The acting in this movie was gorgeous, especially Owen Wilson&#x27;s, who
really gave light to his character and made the film very enjoyable to
watch. Excellent performance! Marion Cotillard was also great in this
movie as Adriana. The other actors in this film also played their roles
well and all contributed to the greatness of the movie as a whole.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. I would definitely recommend this
movie. Good job Woody Allen on a great movie, and same goes to all the
stars in this film!
