This is a nice film. But. I would say highly overrated. When you notice
at this film database that films like &#x27;Manhattan&#x27; and &#x27;Annie Hall&#x27; only
get a few points more than this one, things are a little out of
balance. I take these films (Manhattan, Annie Hall) as the standard for
Woody Allen because they are his very best. I would personally give
these films a 10 rating because it has all Allen can give, in terms of
originality, Personal handwriting, Craftmanship, etc). Compared to
these great films &#x27;Midnight in Paris&#x27; only gets a 6 from me, perhaps
even a 5. It&#x27;s a nice film, but I&#x27;ll not remember it soon after now,
while I will always remember his best films. Also in the 80&#x27;s he made a
few nice ones, although not as good as before mentioned films.
