Fantastic movie, just as enjoyable as The Purple Rose of Cairo, or any
other better movie from him and they always have the following
ingredients: they are hilarious, serious, meaningful, intellectual,
neurotic, they have great story writing - and they are about two
problematic realities of life: relationships and the arrow of time. I
watched Midnight In Paris and what can I say? The next day it still
makes me happy, typing this, with the soundtrack on the background
(Cole Porter, You do something to me). This movie is utterly great
entertainment! Woody Allen does it again! This movie has intellectual
snobs, materialistic women, right-wing politicians, dreamy writers,
time-space mix-ups, all set in Paris. This is a wonderful trip in
cultural history about this greatest city of the world, furthermore
there is great jazz music (buy the soundtrack!), and, the acting is
great. So what more could one want watching this movie? One, to see
Paris immediately, second: a guarantee from above that Woody Allen will
live to a 100 to make many more movies like this. Thank you again Woody
Allen for another knock-out flick with substance! And of course, Owen
Wilson and Rachel McAdams for being such great protagonists!
