2004_November 10 
Before I ever saw this film, I heard it criticized for being
anti-intellectual, for proffering Forrest's limited IQ as a virtue to
be applauded. That was enough to dissuade me from actually watching it
for a long time. When I finally watched it, though, I found it deeply
moving, despite my negative expectations. Yes, it's practically an
exercise in non-stop emotional manipulation. Some of it is so
heavy-handed that even a softie like me could see it coming and
sidestep it. Still, there are other scenes that affect me every time,
even after many viewings. There are moments of pride, humor,
loneliness, gratitude, fear, heartache, and joy, moments that are true
down to the bone, even though the film is obvious fantasy.<br /><br />Still, it took me a long time to embrace this movie. Forrest did indeed
have a low IQ, and is indeed held up as an American hero, and at first
I had trouble with that, just as others did. Our culture has suffered
enough &quot;dumbing down&quot; without popular films promoting stupidity as a
positive thing. Also, the character of Jenny was problematic for me,
enough to keep me ambivalent about the whole movie; Gump's love for her
was almost pathetic and she never seemed to grow in understanding.
Forrest offers his heart each time they meet, and each time she leaves
him behind without explanation or apology, even after the conception of
Forrest Jr., when it seems that she has finally gotten her act
together. Ultimately, she only returns when she knew her time was
nearly ended.<br /><br />Through the years, I came across &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; occasionally on cable
and I would give it another try. I tired of the historical CGI,
inserts, and other pop culture jokes pretty fast; they were mildly
entertaining the first time around, but after that they seem like
they're just in the way, serving only to space out the really
meaningful scenes in order to let you catch your breath. But, oh, those
good moments... I knew I had to get past my reservations and figure out
why I loved this movie. And finally I have.<br /><br />First, I realized that the review I referred to earlier was wrong.
Gump's limited intelligence is not presented as his strength; it's
simply a fact of his life that allows the plot to develop in a certain
way. It also makes him a more balanced character, since everything else
about him is so exceptionally good; his low IQ is a device that allows
us to relate to him on a more equal level. The proof that intelligence
is not denigrated by this film is the very moving scene when Forrest
inquires about his son, fearing that he passed on his only source of
(unearned!) shame to his offspring. (IMO, this single scene is good
enough to justify Hanks' Oscar.)<br /><br />No, this film isn't about the thing Forrest lacks; it's about the
things that he has, and he has them in spades: honesty, generosity,
loyalty, honor, integrity.<br /><br />The most moving story line, for me, is that of Lieutenant Dan. Forrest
saves his life twice, first physically, by dragging him away from a
firefight in Vietnam, and then spiritually, by being a beacon for Dan,
a lighthouse leading him from a tempest of self-destructiveness to a
haven of sanity and peace. I cannot watch Dan's arrival in Bayou le
Batre, or walking at Forrest's wedding, without tears.<br /><br />Jenny? Yes, she fails to appreciate Forrest's better qualities too
often. But there is some explanation for her behavior towards the end
of the film, and in that light I've decided to cut her some slack.
Again, the film just isn't about Jenny's failings, but Forrest's
loyalty.<br /><br />So, after all this time, I'm happy to finally rate this film... 10/10.
