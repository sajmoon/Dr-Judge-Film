&quot;Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you are going to
get.&quot; Regardless of whether you believe it or not, it is certainly true
in Forrest Gump's case. This movie gives us a complicated adventure
story, which happened to a so-called stupid person and the simple
spirit he had. Sometimes, simplicity is far better than complexity.<br /><br />Forrest Gump, played by Tom Hanks, begins by sitting on a bench,
telling strangers his stories, which for them are too amazing to be
believed. He fights in the war, becomes a table tennis champion and
meets the president. Forrest Gump is so down-to-earth. Actually,
Sincerity helps him win everyone's heart. Speaking of sincerity, you
can totally feel it throughout the movie. But it is dying away to some
extent in our real life. The spirit of this movie always inspires me
and makes me feel good.<br /><br />Another impressive part I want to mention is the best performance of
all the cast, plus magnificent music with a perfect picture. My
favorite part is at the beginning of the movie, when a white feather is
floating in the air, with lovely background music, oh, you just can't
wait to see it.<br /><br />If you really want to choose a movie to enjoy, not just see, don't miss
Forrest Gump.
