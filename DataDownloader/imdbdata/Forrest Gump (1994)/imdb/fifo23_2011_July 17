With this movie Hollywood tried to create something like an independent
movie. In my opinion they failed. It&#x27;s like adding lots of elements
people like about independent movies and expecting something
meaningful. If you liked this one you should really have a look on some
serious movies.<br /><br />On the other hand it is a good thing they at least tried to create
something more meaningful. They tried to create something you could
really call art. Maybe they have been out of ideas, maybe they were
experimenting and the financial success and it&#x27;s board recognition are
good signs. Just please don&#x27;t create a movie if you don&#x27;t really have
anything to talk about.
