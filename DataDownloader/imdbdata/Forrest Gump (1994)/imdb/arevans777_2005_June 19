Forrest Gump is my all time favourite movie (shared with Pulp
Fiction!). And I'm not American. I don't know what the movie is trying
to achieve, and I don't really care. All I know is that it touches
every part of me. It's the perfect entertainment. If you ever feel
depressed or life is getting the better of you, watch this movie. For
all its pathos and sadness its the most emotionally uplifting,
good-natured movie ever made. And it achieves all this without an ounce
of schmaltz. It is a movie full of humour, profound wisdom and many
magical and memorable scenes. I love it. And unlike many it only gets
better the more times you watch it.<br /><br />There are some people here trying to load political baggage onto this
movie. I just can't agree. Every institution, belief and value system
is treated with exactly the same irreverence. While the world revolves
violently and tumultuously around Forrest Gump, he takes it all in his
stride with the simple application of his steadfast sense of decency
and love. If the movie tells us anything, it tells us that if we could
all act a little more like Forrest Gump and a little less like we know
it all, the world would be a far better place.
