Forrest Gump is a kind honest sweet movie with edges of real life
sadness.
Forrest takes us back to old days of movies when every other word did not
have to be cursing,Forrest is a simple man making his way through an
unsimple life,the entire cast was brilliant.
A wonderful movie and well deserved an oscar.
We will never see the likes of this kind of movie again.
9 out of 10
