This is a movie which can't be called good for no reason. it had to be
called good for a good reason. what's the reason? tom hanks. Sally
field. And a ton of good quotes.<br /><br />Forrest gump is a partially handicapped man, or so it seems. he goes
through many events of the 60 years, all the way back to the 1940's. he
goes through bullying in his school years, he goes through college
football, he goes to the Vietnam war, and a lot of other things.<br /><br />for all of you folks at home below the age of 14, this movie isn't for
you. nudity, gore, foul language, and a load of sex (you heard me,
sex!) so, if you're too young, step into the pg-13 or pg movies.<br /><br />10/10
