Forrest Gump goes a long way to prove that anybody
can be something, and he receives some help along
the way,when young Hanna Hall protects him from the
bullies, and then when he conquers handicaps to be
a football star. The one weakness is a chronological
inaccuracy--the former Alabama Governor George Wallace
tried to prevent the integration of the University of
Alabama in June of 1963 and then President Kennedy
receives Forrest Gump as an all American. But the
1963 season was still in progress when President Kennedy
was assassinated in Dallas,so he couldn't have met Forrest 
Gump at the White House as an All American the same year
