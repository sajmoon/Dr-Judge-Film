Winston Groom&#39;s novel was optioned to PAramount in 1986 and spent about
seven years gathering dust before Robert Zemekis wanted to option this
into a movie. Eric Roth agreed to pen the screenplay adaptation,and
with some fortuitous and shrewd casting(fortuitous=freshly Oscar-minted
Tom Hanks,shrewd=Gary Sinise,Sally Field,Robin Wright and Mykelti
Williamson)mixed in with clever CGI,a little novel that had a cult
following and was nearly forgotten became a Runaway Summer Box Office
success and a Academy Award winner. <br /><br />Such is the story of the making of Forrest Gump. I tell this,because
the actual story of the film is pretty well understood by now:
slow,possibly retarded Southerner Forrest Gump(Hanks,very un-Hanks-like
and probably why he drew a second Oscar)is waiting on a bus to visit
the love of his life,a troubled woman named Jenny(Robin Wright,nearly
unrecognizable from her days as a soap actress or even from Princess
Buttercup in The Princess Bride). While waiting,he--in his beguiling
and completely unaffected manner--begins to tell strangers who happen
by to wait on a bus about his story,and what a story it is! <br /><br />Born of a unwed mother(Sally Field),he overcomes a birth disorder to
become a champion runner, a college football star(at Alabama for
legendary coach Paul&quot;Bear&quot;Bryant!),a war hero in Vietnam,a champion
Ping Pong player and a successful entrepreneur. Along the way,he is
able to touch the lives(and one has to assume,IS touched by)of the
people who he works around and with,particularly his CO in &#39;Nam(Sinise
in arguably the most haunting performance of the show),his equally slow
bunk mate in the Army(Williamson,unfairly ignored for this
performance)and,of course,Jenny. But while Forrest leads a
Pangloss/Zelig type life through the turbulent period of time that
defined the Baby Boomer generation,he&#39;s still looking for the love that
Jenny seems so reluctant to give.<br /><br />To be real honest,the gild on this Lily for me has came off over the
years(I absolutely LOVED this film when I saw it in a crowded movie
theater on JUly 4th weekend,1994),partly due to the over-abundance of
publicity that this film received over the nearly seven months that it
was in first-run theatrical release. Also,I wasn&#39;t entirely convinced
that this movie deserved all the awards mantle ware that it received.
But I&#39;ve seen this movie at least twice in its entirety and probably as
many as seven or eight times in bits and pieces,plus I own the VHS tape
and may someday want to get the DVD,so I feel like for the most
part,this film is still special to me. I think that&#39;s because of the
summary line:behind the stars,the big-time production,the awards,the
frills,the publicity(Bubba Gump cookbooks,T-Shirts,etc.),lies what can
be simply put as a Southern Tall tale,meant to enchant and inspire the
imagination,set to a period of time(namely,the Western world,circa 1946
to 1981)that is generally regarded as anything but inspirational or
enchanting. This film is for anyone who wants to believe in
larger-than-life tales set in the real world. An unforgettable
film,indeed.
