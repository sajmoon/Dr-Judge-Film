THis movie plain and simply was stupid. There were a couple of laughs
here
and there, but it was carried by the soundtrack. It was like &quot;dumb and
dumber&quot; with better music. It tries to tackle every political and social
issue over the past 50 years. It is a slap in the face to anybody who
lived
through those years to try and bundle them all together. It was not only
corny but long, this movie is the reason that people smoke pot at the
theater!
