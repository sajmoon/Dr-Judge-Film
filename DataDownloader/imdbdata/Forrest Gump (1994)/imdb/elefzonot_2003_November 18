&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is about a one man's victory, that shows us that you can be a
winner all of your life even if you are not that smart...
Tom Hanks really shows here an academy award material by playing the lead
part of Forrest.
The film also shows us the history of the u.s and how Forrest always takes a
huge part of it...
great acting, wonderful story 9/10.
