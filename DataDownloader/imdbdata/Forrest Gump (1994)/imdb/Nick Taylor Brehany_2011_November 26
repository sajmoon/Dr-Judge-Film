Honestly, how can you hate &#x27;Forrest Gump?&#x27; The movie is packed with
comedy, romance, drama, action, and almost everything else! It&#x27;s the
tale of a below-average American boy, and his life growing up through
one of the craziest times in American history, with everything from the
birth of worldwide rock star Elvis Presley, to the Civil Rights
Movement of the 60&#x27;s, and the new technology in the late 70&#x27;s-early
80&#x27;s. Forrest as a character is so simplistic that you cannot help
yourself and love him. This movie should be on your top 10 MUST SEES if
you haven&#x27;t yet. I&#x27;m gonna watch it again tonight for the 8th time and
I&#x27;ll still love it!
