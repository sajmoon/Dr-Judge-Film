This film is got everything!!! Its got the comedy of tom hanks and his
part with him playing it brilliantly i don&#x27;t think anyone could have
played it better he bring out the seriousness of the situations hes in
but still plays them like a child would.<br /><br />Then there&#x27;s the story behind the comedy with it revolving around
Forrest love interest in the film and him trying to win her back from
the life&#x27;s shes chosen..<br /><br />The direction in this film is truly amazing with the war scenes being
intense and sad at the same time..<br /><br />A Classic!!!
