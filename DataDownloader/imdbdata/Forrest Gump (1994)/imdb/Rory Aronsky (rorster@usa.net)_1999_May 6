This is film is one of the best because of the content it has. Forrest Gump
is a dim-witted young man who goes through three turbulent decades
unknowingly while searching for his childhood friend, Jenny. What he goes
through will amaze and astound you. He goes through the Vietnam War,
Watergate, the 60s, and so much more. What is amazing in this film was the
special effects used to incorporate Hank's character into this film. ILM
(Industrial Light &amp; Magic) takes the credit for it and what they do is an
amazing job. <br /><br />Don't miss this film. Go out and rent it tonight.
