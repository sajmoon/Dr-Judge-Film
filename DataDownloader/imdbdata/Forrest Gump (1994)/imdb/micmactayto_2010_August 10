This movie has to be rated one of the best movies, if not the best of
all time. All this talk saying it&#x27;s overrated is nonsense. If it was
overrated how did it take the Oscar from &#x27;The Shawshank Redemption&#x27;.
Tom Hanks is amazing in this film, as is Sally Field. Forrest Gump is a
man with (i&#x27;d guess) an intellectual disability. Forrest witnesses many
famous events and achieves remarkable stuff. It shows that even if you
are not the brightest crayon in the box, you still have a future. Gary
Sinise plays remarkably well in the role of Lt. Dan. &#x22;Run, Forrest!,
Run!&#x22; is a very famous phrase, and yes, Forrest is a very fast runner.
Some scenes may be intense to some viewers, but this film must go down
as one of the very best films of all time. 10 out of ten from me.
Highly recommend.
