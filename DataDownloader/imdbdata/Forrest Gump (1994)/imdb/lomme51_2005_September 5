This is probably the best movie there is! ten points is not enough. I
would give it 100 if I could. If you haven't seen this one, you should
go out and rent it as fast as you can. Tom Hanks have never been
better, and the rest of the cast I have no complaints to make. I
haven't seen them so much before, but as far as I can see they should
all have won an Oscar for best performance! If it could be possible, my
biggest wish right now is that there could be a second movie coming out
soon. Then we would see how it has gone for Forest and his friend
Lt.Dan. If they have made more money or if they have lost it all. (Not
that I believe they would have lost it, with the luck that Forest has).
As i final comment, I have to say that this movie has given me so much
joy through the years. Whenever i'm sad I look at it and it just cheers
me up.
