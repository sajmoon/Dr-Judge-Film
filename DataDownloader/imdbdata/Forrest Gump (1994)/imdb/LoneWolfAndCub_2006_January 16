Forrest Gump, starring Tom Hanks, Sally Field, Robin Wright Penn and
Gary Sinise and directed by Robert Zemeckis, is a lovely tale of one
man who tells his life story at a bus stop while waiting for the bus
that will take him to the woman he has loved for most of his life.<br /><br />Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) has an I.Q. of 75 but has done so much with
his life. He has met three American Presidents, fought in the Vietnam
War, played for the American Football Team and the Ping-Pong Team and
has owned a shrimp-boat. While waiting at a bus top for the bust that
will take him to Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), a life-long friend, he
tells anyone who sits next to him the story of his life. From his
childhood, living in Alabama with his mum (Sally Field), to his battle
in Vietnam under Lt. Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise) and the multitude of
other things he has accomplished.<br /><br />Forrest Gump is a wonderful movie, with a great mix of everything, from
comedy to drama and even war. Forrest Gump is wonderfully acted and
directed. Zemeckis has made a lovely film that is very touching.<br /><br />It only loses half a star because I thought it was a little
over-sentimental.<br /><br />4&frac12;/5.
