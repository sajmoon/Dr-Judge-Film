2006_April 9 
At first I though that this film would be a drag. Like one of these
normal dramas e.g love story. ( not that I have got anything against
love stories)but every single part of it is pieced together
beautifully.<br /><br />There is nothing that you can criticize in this film except for the
fact that it is a tiny bit unrealistic. But it has everything, laughs,
sad moments, and those moments when you want to die with happiness. But
it just shows what one man can do with a powerful mind. I loved this
film.<br /><br />10 out of 10.
