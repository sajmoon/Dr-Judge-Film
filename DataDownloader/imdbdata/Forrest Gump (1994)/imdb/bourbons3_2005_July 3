This film is, in my opinion, one of the best films i have ever seen and
deserves at least 9/10.<br /><br />I agree with the previous comment - how can this film get such a low
rating of less than 9? This film is an epic. It shows that people who
actually care, who are nice people can actually make it in life and
that they can influence others to do good. This film shows that a good
guy like Forrest can be a successful, and i love the fact that he still
chooses to cut lawns for free.<br /><br />Forrest Gump is also hugely funny, and is full of hilarious moments,
like the list of ways you can cook shrimp. It also has a few famous
lines - &quot;Run Forrest run&quot; and &quot;Life is like a box of chocolates....&quot; -
which are instantly recognisable.<br /><br />Its also really impressive when he plays &quot;ping pong&quot; (or Table Tennis
as we call it in UK). Was that really him? If so - he&#39;s got two good
careers! <br /><br />This film is a classic, and everyone should see it either for its
meaning, its comedy or how touching it is. If you rate this film any
less than 9, you&#39;re obviously just trying to get another film at the
top.
