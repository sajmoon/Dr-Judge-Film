I rented this film and thought it was touching. It starts out with Forrest
talking to an Afro-American lady on a park bench and offering her a
chocolate and told her a story about his chldhood he told her a story about
a pair of magic shoes, how he constantly wore medal wires and had a pair of
crutches, and how a School rejected him. The last story he told the lady was
how he met his special friend Jenny on a bus. Forrest and Jenny tought each
other tricks and had to find ways to avoid 3 bullys. One evening Forrest was
hiding in somebodys car but Jenny found him and took him into her house.
Then Jenny was performing at a karaoke bar and he thought someone was trying
to attack Jenny. For help finding out the right thing to do Forrest went off
to join the army. When he returned home his mom and Jenny we're waiting.
Forrest and Jenny we're eventually married. Then a guy left him and Forrest
was in tears and said he would be the one to turn to if he ever needed
anything.
