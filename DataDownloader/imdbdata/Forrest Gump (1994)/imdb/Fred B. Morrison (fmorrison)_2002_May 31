I'm either the only person in the world who didn't get this movie, or the
only one who did. When I saw it I figured the only way to evaluate it was
as
a variation on the great &quot;Being There&quot;-a wicked satire. But then the
mainstream reviews began pouring in and it became clear that people were
taking this Charming Simpleton tripe seriously. Does anyone really believe
that the same Robert Zemeckis who directed one of the most scathing,
vicious
comedies ever (&quot;Used Cars&quot;) has suddenly gone simple himself and meant this
to be taken at face value? It's not a healthy sign when so many people seem
to regard a mentally challenged individual as a role model for all to
emulate.
