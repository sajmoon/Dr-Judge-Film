To say it with a clich&#xE9;: they don&#x27;t make &#x27;em like this anymore.
&#x22;Forrest Gump&#x22; is pretty much everything that was great about 90s
cinema and more. It&#x27;s incredibly long, but it isn&#x27;t boring for a
second. The dialogues are all things at once, one moment they&#x27;re
fast-paced and hilarious and two seconds later they&#x27;re slow and
horrendously saddening. The way the plot develops is truly beautiful,
because Forrest Gump is one of the greatest underdogs I&#x27;ve ever seen in
a movie. You can&#x27;t help but feel happy whenever he accidentally writes
world history, or just when he misunderstands things yet again and
shows his butt to the president. Everything just feels right in this
movie, the script doesn&#x27;t have a word too few or too many. If you
haven&#x27;t noticed, to me this is one of the best movies ever made.
