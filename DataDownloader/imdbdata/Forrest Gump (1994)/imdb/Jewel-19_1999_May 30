1999_May 30 

This movie has it all:  romance, action, family, drama, war, violence,
heroism, and, best of all, comedy.  It's not like Titanic and sappy all
the
way through.  It's not like Pulp Fiction and pure violence.  It's pure and
innocent.  Forrest Gump shows the most innocent way of looking at life
through the eyes of an idiot.  He sees beauty in its most natural form and
only sees with his heart.  He seems to find himself meeting famous people
but doesn't even know about it.  Gump just sees them as people.  He
doesn't
care if they're Elvis Presley or Lyndon B Johnson.  He sees through their
fame and sees the people behind the face.  This movie can be summed up by
a
quote by William Shakespeare:
Life is a tale
Told by an idiot.
And that is exactly what this movie has to offer.  Just remember to bring
the tissues...
