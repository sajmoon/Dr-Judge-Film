What more do you want from a movie than to be taken down emotional roads
where good values win true? What more do you want from a movie than a real
good laugh? What more do you want from a movie than spectacular scenery and
classic direction? (What spectacular war scenes!)<br /><br />The dream of what might be, depicted through fantastical events is pretty
good - isn't it? (a main theme here is the underdog winning and being
cryptically involved in world renowned events) What more do you want from a
movie than unpredictable twists and turns in a plot? All of these factors
keep us going to the movies.<br /><br />Forrest Gump fits and exceeds all of these moulds; it truly rates as one of
my top ten movies (of the last forty five years).
