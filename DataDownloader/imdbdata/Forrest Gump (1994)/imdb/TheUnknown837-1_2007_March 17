Most comedy films are pretty much the same: weak story lines, so-so
acting, pretty much pointless plots, and so on and so forth. However,
&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is a comedy film which is totally different. Because
it&#39;s not just a comedy. It&#39;s a very well-made drama. More than that,
it&#39;s just a well-made movie. Even if it wasn&#39;t funny, it would still be
great. That&#39;s my concept of a good comedy movie. A good comedy movie
needs not only to be funny, but it needs to be able to still hold out
even if you totally eliminated all of the humor in it. And &quot;Forrest
Gump&quot; is the perfect example.<br /><br />Tom Hanks, who won the Academy Award for Best Actor in this film,
pulled off what may be his finest performance on the big screen. That
and what he did in &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. While he&#39;s definitely not
unintelligent in real life, he is talented enough as an actor to make
himself appear to be one. Yet he can still make his character appear
not only to be a half-wit, but a real person as well. Like Forrest Gump
is an actual man and not an actor pulling off a spectacular
performance. Gary Sinise was also excellent in his role.<br /><br />Like I commented earlier, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is a well-made movie and it
would still be just as great even if it wasn&#39;t funny. The drama between
Forrest and Jenny can be at times, heart-breaking or just simply
powerful. Even if Hanks was playing just an ordinary, everyday person
with an ordinary, everyday life. And it also has many moments of dumb
luck.<br /><br />Of course, being a comedy, it must also be given credit for being
funny, which it is. Tom Hanks, again.<br /><br />If I ever had a choice to pick just one comedy film to ever see again
in my lifetime, I would choose &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; because it is not just a
good comedy film, but a good movie. And it&#39;s one of a rare few that I
can give credit for being both at once. It&#39;s one of the finest films
ever made. Worthy of Best Picture, which it won.
