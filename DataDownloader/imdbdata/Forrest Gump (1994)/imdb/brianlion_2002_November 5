Forest Gump is more than a movie. It is a documentary on the 1960's and
1970's. It is well directed, well scripted and well acted. The special
effects were ground-breaking at the time. The musical soundtrack and movie
score also were a perfect match to the various scenes in the movie.  Each
song was a perfect match for the visuals on screen. Tom Hanks became Forest
Gump. It was not so much that Gump made history or that he followed history
as much as he followed his destiny.  His story became history. Reading
history books, I have often wished I could be at some historic moment in
time. Of course, when you force a situation, you never find history. It's is
when you become like Forest Gump, genuine and as a little child, that life
becomes memorable. It is this &quot;be who you are&quot; attitude that drives &quot;Forest
Gump&quot;. This is not to say that this movie doesn't have its' faults. The
Robin Wright character has a tortuous and torturous connection with Forest
Gump. Forest never gave up his love for her, although maybe he should have.
Again, destiny brings them together. The same could be said for the Gary
Sinese character and Forest Gump. Fate brought them together, destiny kept
them together. It is the combination of great direction and Tom Hanks that
keeps the movie together.
