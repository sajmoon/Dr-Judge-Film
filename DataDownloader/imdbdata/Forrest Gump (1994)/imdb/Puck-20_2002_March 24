This movie was indeed like a box of chocolates. The problem is, I don't like
chocolate. I think I had more laughs reading the comments about this movie
[&quot;greatest movie ever!!!...Tom Hanks best acting job!!!&quot; etc.] than I did
watching the movie itself. I guess it was a great movie if all you are used
to are Adam Sandler movies...Of course, I don't think it's the total piece
of garbage that some reviewers called it, either. But I certainly don't
understand the accolades this mediocre comedy/melodrama inspires. Now, what
is funny are the people who thought Tom Hanks's hokey and uneven portrayal
of Gump was &quot;brilliant!!!, fantastic!!!&quot; etc. If you want to see someone do
some REAL acting, go watch Peter Sellers in the 1979 classic &quot;Being
There&quot;...a movie with intelligence.
