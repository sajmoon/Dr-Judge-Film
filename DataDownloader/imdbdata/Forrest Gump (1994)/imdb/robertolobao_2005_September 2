Forrest Gump is the most pretty and emotional movie I've ever seen.
There are many scenes with an intensity witch you car rarely watch in
the universe of the movies. The way Tom Hanks conduce Forrest make us
believe in a kind of behavior witch is very uncommon, but possible in a
human being. Besides, there are many beautiful scenes that make any
sensitive person in tears. <br /><br />Forrest Gump loves Jenny Curran since they were children, and she takes
years to understand it and even feel the same, but after she dies, one
day he goes to her splutter, and there is wrote &quot;Jenny Gump&quot;. The
poetry in this final scene is something that no other love story may
have. About the relationship between Forrest and his mother, the movie
shows the true perfection in every mother's love in the world.
