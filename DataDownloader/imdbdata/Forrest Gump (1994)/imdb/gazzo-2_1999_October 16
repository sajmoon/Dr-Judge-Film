1999_October 16 

This wasn't anything special, if you want to know my thinking-I really
thought they went over board in their putting Forrest the Dummox here into
Every significant historical event since '55,. So he saw Elvis, JFK, did
Vietnam, Watergate, started the jogging craze, had his slutty gal die of
Aids, etc. So what? The film shoulda ended before they started the whole
Forrest Running across the USA  bit; instead it got milked and milked even
farther than before.<br /><br />Gimme a break.<br /><br />I liked Hanks' work here, and some of the direction, but the whole film
struck me as being an overlong episode of either the Twilight Zone or
Quantam Leap. So Forrest was there for everything important in Western
Culture since Ike-so what???
Yawn.<br /><br />**1/2 outta ****, gimme Back to the Future or American Graffiti anytime over
this.
