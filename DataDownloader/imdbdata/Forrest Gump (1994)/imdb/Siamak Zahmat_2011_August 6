With this wisdom the movie takes off and Forrest Gump introduces
himself. He tells his life story to anyone who wants to hear it. And
what a story it is. Although simple-minded, following the advice of his
mother and childhood friend Jenny, Forrest gets places. His mother
tells him he&#x27;s the same as everyone else, and no different at all. And
she makes sure he goes to a regular school, no matter what it takes.
And on the school bus he meets his one and only girlfriend, Jenny.
Together they&#x27;re like peas and carrots. She tells him that whenever
he&#x27;s in trouble, he should run away. And she cheers him shouting &#x27;Run,
Forrest, run!&#x27;. He can run like the wind blows. It literally takes him
anywhere. During his travels, he also meets up with various interesting
people and gets involved in American history in the making. <br /><br />Tom Hanks puts up a great performance and definitely pulls it off with
flying colors. Robert Zemeckis, is a master of special effects, and
uses it very effectively to include Forrest Gump into historical
events. In the end, it&#x27;s a wonderful and inspiring movie. Highly
recommended. <br /><br />Rating: PG-13 or 12 (NL)
