Forrest Gump is one of my favourite movies and has to be one of the most
feelgood movies of our time. However I feel that people are unnecessarily
harsh on the film due to the success it recieved at the academy awards. It
beat Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption to the Best Picture Oscar
and
has been criticised since. All three films are superb movies in their own
right, ( Shawshank just shading it as my favourite), and should be enjoyed
on their own merits rather than on what they prevented others
doing.<br /><br />I may be wrong but I feel a lot of the criticism of the film is due to the
academy awards and that if Forrest Gump had won on a different year it
would
not suffer the criticism it does.<br /><br />Anyway on with the film. Hanks was brilliant as usual and the support
players especially Sinise, and Williamson will live long in the memory. OK
towards the end there are too manny references on how Forrest misses Jenny
(
e.g naming the boat )but overall I think Robert Zemeckis balances out the
emotional with the humorous and it is close to a perfect
film.<br /><br />1994 was truly a great film and the arguments about who should have won
will
go on and on, just be grateful that 3 splendid films came out together. It
has not happened since.
