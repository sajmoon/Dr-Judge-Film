After becoming increasingly disenchanted throughout this seemingly
endless film, I began to wonder what the message, if any, was. It
appeared to me that the theme was that it didn&#39;t matter if you were an
idiot, things would work out fine so long as you are American and your
hearts is pure. Some time after seeing the movie I read extracts from
the original book which was clearly of more satirical intent. Forrest
Gump is a modern day Candide living out a pseudo-panglossian idyll
where everything works out for the best (in this best of all possible
worlds.) While the book clearly highlights the absurdity of this, the
movie takes a superficial view that illustrates the situations without
any apparent understanding of irony.
