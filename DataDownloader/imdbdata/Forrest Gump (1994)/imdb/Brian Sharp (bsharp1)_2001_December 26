I have to comment on Mr. Ben Morgan's review of Forrest Gump.  He called
the
movie a dupe because of its over-hyped publicity and positive reviews, and
gave reasons why he felt the film was not great, but instead &quot;just above
mediocre&quot;.  However, his reasons did not prove to me that the film was not
great, it just proved that this is not the kind of film that he enjoys.
Using his logic, I could say that Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was not a
great film because I do not enjoy movies with sub-titles.  This of course
does not prove that the film is not great, but rather proves that it's just
a film that I wouldn't enjoy personally.<br /><br />Forrest Gump is not an exercise in mush and sentimentality, as Mr. Morgan
put it, but rather a well-directed, well-acted masterpiece.  It is a coming
of age story about a man who succeeds in each phase of life despite obvious
disadvantages.  It has a wonderful story, a top-notch soundtrack, and
fantastic images of war, post-war, and 1960's through 80's
America.
