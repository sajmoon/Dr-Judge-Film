I never saw Forrest Gump at the movie, for some reason just the title seem
to
turn me off, I can't tell you how wrong I was.<br /><br />I believe this is one the the most beautiful films I'm seen in quite a
while.  This movie will touch upon all your emotions, some scenes will make
you want to laugh, other scenes will make you want to cry and you will come
away with a little different attitude about what life is all about.  Its
like a box of chocolates you never know what you're going to get<br /><br />I applaud the characters and the actors, especially Tom Hanks he just did a
wonder job.<br /><br />I would highly recommend to film to people who just want a taste of life,
reality, just a simple but highly emotional film.
