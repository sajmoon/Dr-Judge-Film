Hollywood produces this kind of feel-good movie all the time: They're corny
and over-sentimental, they promote traditional family values and are an
example of how the little guy can live the American dream, y'all. And
Forrest Gump is guilty of all of this, but somehow it all fits together and
is an entertaining and genuinely moving film.<br /><br />Tom Hanks excels as lovable half-wit Forrest (kind of a cross between Homer
Simpson and Superman) and gets into all sorts of nutty adventures whilst
exploring America's recent social history. But essentially this is the story
of Forrest's fruitless pursuit of his childhood sweetheart Jenny. Forrest's
mental backwardness is never really taken too seriously in the film, but it
forms a constant and unspoken division between Forrest and the girl of his
dreams, and it is this subtle undercurrent throughout the whole film which
makes is so watchable.<br /><br />However, it's cringe-worthy and moving in equal measure - the scenes in
which Forrest meets Elvis and John Lennon are incredibly naff. But overall
it succeeds. Bizarrely, the film  won the 1994 'best picture' Oscar ahead of
Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption, and whilst it's clearly not in
the same class as either of those two, this is the best corny,
over-sentimental, feel-good  film I've ever seen! 7/10.
