Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump, a man with a low I.Q., but a good outlook
on life. He lives through many historical events and always seems to
run into his childhood friend/love interest Jenny.<br /><br />Where do I began to start describing this film? Tom Hanks is one of my
favorite actors, so he did a great job being Forrest. Gary Sinise also
did a good job being Lt. Dan. Sally Field did good portraying Mrs.
Gump, Forrest&#x27;s mother. I loved how the movie showed many historical
events, just to name a couple: the Vietnam War and the Reagan
assassination attempt. Some of the lines were pretty funny and even
heartfelt.<br /><br />Another thing I love about this movie is how some of the characters
talk about if we all have our own destiny or if we&#x27;re just floating in
a breeze. Something like that always gets me thinking about the life
God has given me. <br /><br />Overall, Forrest Gump is an amazing movie that anybody will enjoy and
that everyone should see. I watch it whenever it&#x27;s on T.V.
