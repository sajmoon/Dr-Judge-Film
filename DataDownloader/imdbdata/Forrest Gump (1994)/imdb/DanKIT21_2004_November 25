This is my favorite movie of ALL TIME. I don't understand why so many
people associate sentimentality with junk. Sentimentality is what makes
us human and what differentiates us from other species. Just because FG
revolves around a &quot;dumb&quot; protagonist, it doesn't mean that the movie is
&quot;dumb.&quot; In fact, Forrest's emotional IQ is much higher than most
people's even though he is intellectually retarded. We can all learn
from Forrest that big brains don't guarantee happiness. He is stupid,
yes, but he is probably the happiest character in this film because of
all the complexities of life he is unable to understand.<br /><br />A perfect example: when Jenny tells FG he doesn't know what love is
when they're standing by the bridge. She later finds out she is the one
who doesn't &quot;get it&quot; (i.e. when Forrest asks her to marry him and says
&quot;I am not a smart man but I know what love is.&quot; How can anyone NOT LIKE
this movie??
