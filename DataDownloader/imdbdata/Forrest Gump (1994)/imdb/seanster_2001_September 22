On the plus side, I think I saw this movie for free, or at the most paid $1
for admittance when I was in college and it was shown in the campus
theater.
On the negative side is everything else, most notably the movie's lack of
empathy for any of its character.  Every character, not just Gump, is
walking through this movie with no goal, no destination, and no clue, as to
what the other characters are doing.  Someone off-screen must've just
shouted &quot;move&quot; over and over again, and then filmed the result.  Gump goes
here.  Gump goes there.  Sally Field says this.  Sally Field dies.  And so
on.  The reasons behind the historical footage inserts is not to prove it
can be done but to distract one from realizing how badly the rest of the
film had come together up until the inserts.<br /><br />Anyone who cheers for this movie must also resemble a box of chocolates -
flat, consisting of cardboard, and soon empty of their contents.
