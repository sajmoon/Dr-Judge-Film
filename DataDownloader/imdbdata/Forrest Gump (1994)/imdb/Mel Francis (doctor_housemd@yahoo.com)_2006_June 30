Forrest Gump is one of those epic films, which .. like Donnie Darko is
not most exciting action film with amazingly skillful stunts etc, but
its got something special that nobody can take away from it, to stop
its being special. Tom Hanks is such an adaptable actor, ranging from a
relatively normal everyday role in &quot;Splash&quot; to his more intelligent and
formal role in &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; movie release. In FG, he inevitably
gives his best in the portrayal of Forrest, an individual whose IQ is
no greater than 75 - just over the borderline of appearing mentally
challenged. However, despite the fact that he has no real aspirations
in life, he does know one important thing, he loves Jenny and he enjoys
the simple things in life, mainly because he can understand and cherish
them more readily, and they are easily accessible too. He is a wholly
lovable character and the audience will remember this film for a long
time after first watching it. Watch it now. Mel x
