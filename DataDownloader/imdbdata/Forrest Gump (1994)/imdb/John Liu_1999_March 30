This movie is not about how time changes a person. It is about how time has
NOT changed a person. Regardless of the environment he was in, Forrest
remained loyal to his friends, and loyal to his beliefs.
An extraordinary story in an ordinary man. A profound message in a witty
plot. On top of these, attention is paid to every detail. The truth in
Forrest Gump makes all falsehood blush.
