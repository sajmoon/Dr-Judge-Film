1999_August 31 

First of all, I want to say that I'm really sick and tired
at all the immature idiots who note this film as only being about a &quot;retard&quot;
and quoting all of his famous one-liners such
as &quot;shot in the butt-ox&quot;, &quot;Jennay&quot;, etc. I saw this as a
film straight from the heart of the baby boomer generation
apologizing for their bad behavior in the 1960's and early 1970's and
showing as simple, uncorrupted man who happens to
meet every other famous person in that period and through
many social trends and changes in society and still the only
people who remain important in his life are his mother, son, Army
buddies, and Jenny, who drifts in and out of his life from
high school in the 1950's to the early 1980's, when finally
her destructive lifestyle of promiscuous sex and drugs cost her
life.<br /><br />By the way, the boy playing his son in the end was the boy
in &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;.
