One would think you would have to be 5 years old to like this movie.
Tom Hank&#39;s worse acting job ever. If you could call it an acting job.
&quot;Dah, I&#39;m a dumb guy, please have empathy for me.&quot; This movie begs for
your sympathy. But Forrest is a hollow shell, and as unbelievable as
the inane plot. How can anyone like this movie. Your more likely to
meet the Wizard of OZ in Emerald City than you are to meet an athlete
like Forrest Gump. It&#39;s not possible and it&#39;s not funny to pretend that
it is possible. How about a sequel where Gump becomes a heart throb
movie actor? Or a brain doctor? Or how about an investment banker? It&#39;s
not funny. It&#39;s not interesting. And poorly acted. Just plain stupid.
Puke...And it made a lot of money. And is one of the most highly rated
movies. Go figure.
