2002_December 5 

I originally gave Forrest 9 out of a possible 10.  But since then I have
seen the whole movie a couple of more times and parts of it on DirecTV
many
more times.  No matter which part it is in, that part can stand so well
by
itself and still be part of the whole.  I have just gotten to like this
movie more and more with time.  The only other movie that has affected me
in
this way is &quot;L. A. Confidential&quot;.  I gave it a 10 to start with so I
can't
raise my vote on it.  In a similar vein, I thought that &quot;The Shawshank
Redemption&quot; was one of the best movies I had ever seen.  I have also seen
it
again in whole and in parts.  It remains as high as ever, but I got that
feeling from the very beginning.  With Forrest and LA, they continued to
improve in my mind with time.  Perhaps, this shows how well done
Shawshank
was that I got it from the very start.
