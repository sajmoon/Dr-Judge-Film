What can&#39;t be said about this movie? It contains all the ingredients to
what life is all about in 2+ hours of film. A simple, loyal, courageous
man who, although thought to be slow by others, saw very clearly what
is right and what&#39;s wrong, while those around him struggled with the
concept and scoughed &quot;Oh, he just doesn&#39;t get it because he&#39;s slow.&quot; He
got it alright; Forrest was a pure person in pure form. Everyone should
be so lucky. Saving his fellow man during war time, saving his friend
from drowning, never, ever giving up on the one true love of his life,
and being an amazing father... he was all this and so much more.<br /><br />The music and scenery in the film of course, were simply staggering.
What a beautiful movie with a beautiful message.<br /><br />Along with Shawshank redemption, Forrest Gump these are my two favorite
movies of all time. No other movie comes close.<br /><br />-Tracy Milburn
