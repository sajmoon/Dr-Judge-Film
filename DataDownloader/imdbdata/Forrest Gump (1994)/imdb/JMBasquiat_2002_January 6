'Forrest Gump' is a wonderful movie. Forrest grows up as a mentally and
physically challenged kid who goes on to inspire others and represent
what is good and bad in American life, essentially embodying the idea
of 'The American Dream'. The wonderful and clever use of inserting Tom
Hanks (as Forrest) into the famous clips of notable people (from JFK to
John Lennon) is gimmicky but it works and makes for a marvellous film.
The period feeling of he times that Forrest moves through from meeting
Elvis to serving in the Vietnam War are so real. Forrest Gump is a kind
of biography of the USA from the 50's to the 80's and has a lot to say
about these times. This is a great movie!
