Forrest Gump would make the perfect Taoist; he cares about little<br /><br />except for love, and his handicaps (as seen by the audience) are<br /><br />actually strengths.  Forrest Gump has no &quot;direct&quot; control over his<br /><br />life, but still makes a fortune and has an adventure through<br /><br />goodwill and love.  Out of all his accomplishments, finding and<br /><br />loving Jenny is his top one and he knows it.  Everything else that is<br /><br />so monumental means little to him.
