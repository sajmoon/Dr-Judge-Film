Wow! was the first reaction I got when I first sat through Forrest Gump.
This movie has to be one of the top three movies for the 90's. After you
watch it, you have a whole new perspective on life and the trials it brings
to you. Tom Hanks gives an incredible performance, and he was without a
doubt worthy of the Oscar he received in 1995 for this piece of movie
magic.
The supporting cast is superb, which includes the young actors who play
young Forrest,Jenny, and the now famous Haley Joel Osmet, who plays Forrest
Jr. Watch this movie, and after you do, you will realize life is just like
a
box of chocolates...you never know what your gonna get!**** Stars.
