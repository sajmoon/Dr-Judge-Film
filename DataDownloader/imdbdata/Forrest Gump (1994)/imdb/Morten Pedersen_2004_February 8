Where shall I begin... This movie learned me to look at things on a new
way.
And not have the same look at all things, but look at things from a
different angle. Forrest's tragic life, where everybody he loves dies,
helped me to see that there's another opportunity. Clear it out. Don't
worry
about it, but go from the stage you stopped. It really touched something
in
me. And I appreciate that the director has made this movie. Thanks. Go and
see the movie, and think it over. It really helps you to wonder how
beautiful life is.
