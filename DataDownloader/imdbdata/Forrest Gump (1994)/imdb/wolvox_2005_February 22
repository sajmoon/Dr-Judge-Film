This movie is pure truth, love and innocence. This is kind of movie
that you can watch over and over, and you will always find something
new, something that you didn't recognize. Watching World trough Forrest
Gamp eyes, World will be better place to live! Simple, masterpiece of
Robert Zemeckis. Best movie that I ever see! I must say it again: This
movie is pure truth, love and innocence. This is kind of movie that you
can watch over and over, and you will always find something new,
something that you didn't recognize. Watching World trough Forrest Gamp
eyes, World will be better place to live! Simple, masterpiece of Robert
Zemeckis. Best movie that I ever see!
