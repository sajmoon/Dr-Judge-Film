I saw this movie, years ago, when it was first released, and am<br /><br />commenting on it now, years later, as it is and always will be one<br /><br />of my favorite films.  Everyone has a little, or a lot of Forrest in<br /><br />them. Though not all share his IQ, or his talents, I think all people<br /><br />share some of his heart. Forrest is the ultimate everyman.  His<br /><br />positive outlook on life, no matter the instance, and enjoyment of<br /><br />the small things,  is something that inspires. Also Lt. Dan is<br /><br />relatable for the rest of us, who have a more pessimistic outlook<br /><br />on things, but even in the end, he sees how to be grateful for his<br /><br />life, and live it, which is what most people want, I think.  The love<br /><br />story between Forrest and Jenny, is also one of the most beautiful<br /><br />in film history I feel, entirely pure to the core, yet not a perfect<br /><br />journey, or ending. The incredible acting by the entire cast, but<br /><br />especially the three leads, just cemente this beautiful story as one<br /><br />of the greatest films ever made. The score is also amazing, and<br /><br />helps us along the journey, to get lost in Forrest's world.
