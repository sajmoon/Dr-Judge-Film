Words cannot describe my amazement at the Oscars and the movie-going
public in general for rating this film highly.<br /><br />It features a passable performance from Tom Hanks, yet is nothing
special. The direction is insipid, whilst the schmaltz that Zemekis
seems to adore in his films is disgraceful.<br /><br />There are moments of comedy, and some interesting and fairly enjoyable
plot turns, yet none can really be taken seriously, so far removed from
plausibility, over-egged, and overlong this film is.<br /><br />In short, this is the most shocking display of public affection for a
mediocre film at best since Titanic.<br /><br />By all means go see, but do not expect anything resembling a good film;
this is passable TV film fare- watch, then forget.
