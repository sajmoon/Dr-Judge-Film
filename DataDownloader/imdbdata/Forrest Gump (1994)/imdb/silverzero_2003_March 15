Winning umpteen different Oscars in 1994 and constantly parodied, Forrest
Gump manages to live up to its `classic' status. Although it does become a
bit too manipulative and sometimes surreal in parts, it's also very witty
and joyfully nostalgic. <br /><br />Tom Hanks does the role of crippled hero Forrest Gump (the most parodied
character on the planet). He's ideal for the role but despite whoever takes
on the role, the character himself is very unconvincing. Gary Sinise is a
lot more convincing as a cynical Vietnam soldier. Sally Field (melodramatic
as usual) doesn't show us anything new but is good for the part nonetheless.
Robin Wright doesn't do much in the film, even though the plot kind of
revolves around her. A but more conviction would have been helpful.<br /><br />What the film is best for is its wonderful depiction of the rockin' 50's,
the swingin 60's and the sleazy 70's. This is accompanied by a soundtrack,
which is well suited to the times. However, the film falls way short on its
portrayal of the (glitzy?) 80's. The costumes, set designs and attitudes
seem very inappropriate and very little thought went into this part of the
movie. The other problem is the script. For the most part it is good but it
gets too inventive in some scenes and goes way too far. Some surrealism is
OK but having one man be involved in every major event in three decades is
crossing the line. <br /><br />Overall, `Forrest Gump' probably didn't deserve to win the Oscar for Best
Picture, but if you put all of the evident flaws aside, you have a great
movie. I give it 7.5/10.
