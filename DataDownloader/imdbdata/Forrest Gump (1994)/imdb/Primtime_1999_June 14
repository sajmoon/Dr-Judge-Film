1999_June 14 

Forrest Gump is pure magic to watch. How anyone could say that this film
is
lacking in any way or that the hidden messages within render it to the
garbage heap baffles me. Just the way that the film moves alone makes it
great, you can toss out the story, performances and direction and Forrest
Gump would still be miles ahead of the rest.<br /><br />Tom Hanks gives a great performance in the title role (although Morgan
Freeman was probably more deserving in the Shawshank Redemption). Hanks
portrays the man with an I.Q. of 75 like few actors could and maintains
this
throughout the film. Just the way that Forrest stumbles through all of the
great U.S. events from the 50's to the 80's and thinks nothing of it is an
accomplishment in itself.<br /><br />Zemekis did well making this film, just like the Back To The Future
series.
This film surely did not lack vision and all concepts are fresh and real
for
the time. Who would have ever thought that they could be placed in an
interview with John Lennon? Well now thanks to Industrial Light and Magic,
anyone can. Regardless what others may say about a weak or nonexistent
ending, did the other 1994 favourite have one? Not really. This film is
tied
up about as well as possible with yet another coincedence.<br /><br />I haven't a bad thing to say about this film and fully recommend to
all.<br /><br />9/10 stars.
