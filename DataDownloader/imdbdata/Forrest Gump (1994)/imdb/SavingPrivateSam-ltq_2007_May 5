One of the best movies in 1994. The best time I watched it, I was still
a teenager, so I couldn&#39;t understand it well. And once, I heard it was
on Top 250, I&#39;ve decided to watch it again. So, after I&#39;ve done
watching it, it was such an excellent movie. Forrest Gump, an idiot
from Alabama, has witness many historical things. And he even met those
presidents. And he even had his own shrimping company. And Tom Hanks
did such a great performance, he has never done such a great
performance in any other movie. And Robin Wright, played Jenny, which
was Forrest&#39;s girlfriend, did a great job too. This movie is
meaningful, it can give you a special message after you done watching
it. Don&#39;t spend times on those meaningless movies, this is the best
choice for watching. My vote is ten. Robert Zemickis is great.
