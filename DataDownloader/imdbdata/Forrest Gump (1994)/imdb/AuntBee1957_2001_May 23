After all the hype and promotion, I was disappointed at the lack of
content.
The scenes of nudity and sexuality were unnecessary and made a film which
could have been great an embarrassment for those of us who prefer to stay
out of other folks' bedrooms.  The acting by Mr. Hanks, however, was
superb.
(The only reason I gave it a &quot;3&quot; instead of a &quot;1&quot;)  He made me empathize
with, and love, Forrest.  His portrayal of this gentle man was the bright
spot in this fatally flawed movie.
