This movie is the best movie ever! It is so touching and you are
guaranteed
to be left with an excellent feeling after watching it.  Tom Hanks
delivers
an AMAZING performance, one of his best ever.  He plays Forrest so well.
Gary Sinise is scary as always. He did portray Lt. Dan very well. With
it's
actors and beautiful plot line this movie is one of the
best.
