This is a good film for Tom Hanks. He plays a good role as Forrest. I
never
read the book but I liked the movie though. It was funny, especially the
part where he drinks fifteen Dr. Peppers and has to go to the washroom
while
meeting John F. Kennedy. I liked it though, it wasn't Tom Hanks best films
but it was still good.
