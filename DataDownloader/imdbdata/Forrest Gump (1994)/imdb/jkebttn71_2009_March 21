Will be every man&#39;s excuse to cry at this film (I accepted the fact I
cried at this and I&#39;m a guy). What doesn&#39;t help is the music, so
emotionally moving and make you get a lump in your throat every time
you here it. who is forrest gump? Forrest Gump is the clear
representation that everyone can love, good or bad, smart or dumb we
all can find it. I&#39;m not gonna go on about the fantastic script,
directing, cinematography or musical score. But I will say that every
actor/ actress in the film &#39;is&#39; the character they portray. Tom Hanks
gives a performance which will make you laugh and cry (one of the top 5
greatest performances ever). the story is about his life and how he
happens to run into every major event of the past 50 years. A truly
moving story, one of the best films ever. so what if its very
Hollywood, still beautiful
