To tell the truth,I don't agree with certain views expressed in this movie
and I thought the characters were stereotypical.I have to admit Tom Hanks is
a great actor but this is not his best movie.That honour goes to The Green
Mile.But Forrest Gump was an overrated movie because it won the best picture
oscar among excellent and intelligent movies like The Shawshank Redemption
and Pulp Fiction.I thought the movie dragged on and the only high point of
the movie was Tom Hanks' excellent portrayal
of Forrest Gump.You can watch this movie once,not more than
that.
