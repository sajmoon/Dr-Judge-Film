This is my all time favorite movie, since the first time I saw
it!
before I saw this movie, people were telling me stuff like &quot;this is a very
serious movie,&quot; &quot;this movie is all about life, you have to pay close
attention to every word the characters said while watching it&quot;...etc.<br /><br />Well, so far I've seen this movie about 5 times.  Since the first time I
saw
this movie in high school, I don't really see how serious this story ever
gets (except for some of the really touching scenes, if you wanna call it
&quot;serious&quot;).  To me, this story is extremely entertaining, extremely!  I
can't stop laughing from the beginning till about the last 20 minutes (and
the part where Forrest's mom died), then I want to cry.<br /><br />My feeling is that... a lot of people are stretching it too hard to make
it
a serious, meaningful, deeply insightful movie.  It doesn't have to be
(although it can be in some ways).  Forrest Gump can just be a movie of
enjoyment.  Take a break, watch this movie; and take it easy while
watching
it, not every movie has to teach a lesson even when other people told you
so.  This is the most entertaining movie you'll find out there if you are
not spending all your time trying to squeeze out a profound meaning out of
everything in this movie.
