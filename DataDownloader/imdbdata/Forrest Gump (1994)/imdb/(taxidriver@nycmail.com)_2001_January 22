Whether or not Forrest Gump is an over-hyped, overrated film does not matter
to me; I find it to be an excellent film. By far Robert Zemeckis' best film,
and perhaps Hanks' best performance, the story of Forrest is one that
fascinates and inspires. Forrest's triumphs and struggles are all portrayed
so honestly and beautifully by Hanks that it's hard not to be manipulated by
a film of this stature. I found myself laughing and almost to tears several
times throughout the film, and only a few can do that to the viewer.
Although many believe that Pulp Fiction is better than Forrest Gump, I have
to disagree. Rarely does a fictional-biographical film come along that is
this good.<br /><br />As far as the film itself goes, everything is done almost perfectly. Great
writing, direction, amazing acting, good cinematography and a wonderful
score. See the film that many dislike, but a lot more appreciate.<br /><br />****1/2 /5
