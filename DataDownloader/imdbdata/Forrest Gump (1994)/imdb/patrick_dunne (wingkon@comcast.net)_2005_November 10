A mentally-challenged man is telling his life to random people on a
bench. Good idea? Sure, it doesn't sound too promising, but trust me-it
is! The film starts out with Tom Hank's wonderful performance of
Forrest Gump. He sits on a bench telling his about his life to people
that will listen. What exactly is his life? Forrest has lived a
dramatic, passionate life full of love, romance and laughs.<br /><br />Forrest Gump plays out in chronological order. We start out in his
childhood, which Forrest lives through without a father. When he goes
to school, he meets Jenny, the girl he is destined to fall in love
with. The childhood is a bit embarrassing- the kids are all very odd,
but luckily, that is soon over when Forrest goes to high school. He is
picked on for his low IQ, and only Jenny sticks up for him. When the
kids throw rocks at him, he runs. And thus, one of the most famous
lines in Cinema History: &quot;Run Forrest, run!&quot; So, Forrest lives through
life, often meeting historical figures, which are seen through
Forrest's eyes. (The tag line is &quot;Your world will never be the same,
once you've looked through the eyes of Forrest Gump.&quot;) Meanwhile, Jenny
goes in her own direction, having boyfriends, becoming a hippie,
prostituting, and much more.<br /><br />Through the thirty years Forrest lives, only a few moments are spent
with Jenny. Because of this, those moments are the sweetest moments of
them all. Well, they might be. There are so many moments; it's hard to
pinpoint just one.<br /><br />I know this film has some flaws such as some gross jokes, and
embarrassing moments. I cannot deny these flaws, but I also cannot deny
the warmth that was in my heart after the movie was over. <br /><br />The acting, witty humor, drama, creativity and romance will do noting
less than put a smile on your face.<br /><br />10/10<br /><br />Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.
