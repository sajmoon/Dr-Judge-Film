Well, i jus don&#x27;t know wat to begin with when it comes to this
particular movie, this is my first comment on IMDb and i wanted to
start with this. I saw this movie very late in my personal DVD, n had
no much expectations about it except my cousin saying its a great
movie. And to be frank this one turned out to be my most favourite
movie, and already i liked tom hanks and he became my most favourite
actor after this. That says it all, great movie, great acting, n great
everything. Life history of a person cant be said in a better way.
Folks do watch this movie, don&#x27;t miss it for anything.My rating is
10/10 for this. The best.
