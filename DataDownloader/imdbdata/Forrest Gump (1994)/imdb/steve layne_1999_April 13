1999_April 13 

i liked forrest gump. it was a very
smart,and well-crafted movie. it pretty much
has it all. i was pretty shocked by this
movie. i thought it was another big hyped-up
movie,but it wasn't. it was a good
movie. people can talk bad about this movie
all they want. they're maybe the same people
that believe movies like psycho,rocky,and
the texas chainsaw massacre are classics
please.now those movies are movies that are
over-hyped,and highly overrated.i give
forrest gump *** out of ****
