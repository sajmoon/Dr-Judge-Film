From start to finish this movie will make you laugh to you cry. Tom
Hanks is superb as Forest Gump. He is supported by a cast that pops in
and out of the scenes with unforgettable performances. As the movie
begins you think of Forrest Gump as simple country boy who is lacking
the intelligence to ever be more than a footnote to the human race. As
the movie progresses you find Forrest excelling in every endeavor but
public speaking and common sense. He seems almost autistic in his
endeavors. By the time the movie reaches its end realizing Forrest Gump
is not a smart man is not difficult, but his character gives us much
insight into why people, although not having a high IQ, can still make
important contributions to society... Forrest Gump obviously was never
at the many significant events that were the fabric of the movie but by
movies end you'll wish he had been... life would definitely have been
more interesting. I gave the movie a 10 not because the movie was
great, I rated it a 10 because it is great fun for the entire family!
