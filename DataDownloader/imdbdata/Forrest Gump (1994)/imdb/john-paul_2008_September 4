2008_September 4 
I first watched this film some years ago as a child growing up, as a
kid i didn&#39;t really understand the true nature of the film, i was far
to interested in the war scenes overall. its only years later that i
come to watch this film again...this film takes you on a ride, a ride
through another mans life, another mans point of view, and most of all
another mans innocence in a world so harsh and lack of understanding.
its a beautiful tale of love,happiness,heartache,war,death and also
chocolates...being a man myself, i didn&#39;t watch this the second time
with any caution what so ever, why would i need to ? well i wish i kept
my guard up because i find it impossible to not be reduced to tears
after such a movie, its the best few hours you will ever have when
watching a film, never disappointing always inspiring, i take my hat
off to a masterpiece.
