Just had the honor of revisiting simply one of the best movies ever made,
Forest Gump. What more can you ask for? Bob Zemeckis directs a film that
will, in some form, live forever. Tom Hanks gives, in my opinion, the best
acting performance since 1994. Alan Silvestri's music soars, while the songs
of the era remind us of the times of our lives. I make films and television
shows for a living. I wonder if I'll ever make a film as good as this. My
thanks to everybody who worked on this classic. As a lover of great movie
making you've moved me to tears.<br /><br />10 out of 10 - Any lower score means the viewer is brain
dead.
