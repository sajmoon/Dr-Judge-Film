In all my years and all the films I have seen in my life Forrest Gump was
truly one of the greatest. A simple minded Forrest Gump travels through the
60's. 70's, &amp; 80's and even though the times change Forrest stayed the
same. A college football star, a war hero, a ping pong champion, and shrimp
tycoon.
Tom Hanks pours out one of the finest acting performances in film history
and is supported by a tremendous cast, Gary Sinise, Robin Wright Penn and
Sally Field. Robert Zemeckis directs a true winner and the special effects
were flawless. Life truly will never be the same after you see Forrest Gump.
4 star classic
