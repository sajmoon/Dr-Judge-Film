1999_July 7 

i saw this movie for the first time in a long time a few
weeks ago. and i like it better now than i ever did. the
movie is just great. it's a movie that has it all. it's
funny at times,and very touching. in my opinion it's one
of the best,if not (THE)  movie of the 90's! tom hanks is
very great in this movie. to me it lives up to every bit
of it's hype it got. it's a remarkable achievement. the
movie just touched me so much when i saw it a few weeks ago for
the first time,in a long time. it's a truly unforgettable
movie. it's become one of my favorite movies of all time.<br /><br />i love this movie,and always will. i give forrest gump
