It you like poetry and philosophy,i assure you will like this
movie.Forrest&#x27;s being son,lover,friend,husband and father,it summarizes
the whole essence of life.The movie is narrated like poem with touch of
philosophy.Probably the only little boring part of movie is the
reference of American history during Forrest&#x27;s life.Tom Hanks has done
good justice to his role dedicatedly.His narration is good in the
movie.The most interesting and unique part of the movie is Forrest&#x27;s
innocence,which is the backbone and admiral part of this story.Its an
different feeling you will get after watching the movie,evethough the
movie is a bit emotional and sentimental,which is inevitable part of
human life.
