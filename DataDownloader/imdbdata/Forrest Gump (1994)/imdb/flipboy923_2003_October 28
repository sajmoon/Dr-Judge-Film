...Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump is a cinematic achievement.  Tom
Hanks
plays Forrest, a mentally handicapped man living through the turbulent
times
of American history.  Hanks gives an awe-inspiring performance; you can
literally see the naive innocence within Hanks' eyes while he plays a man
who only wants to do what's right and be the one that he loves.
Technically, the movie is a marvel to behold.  You see Forrest in these
situations with famous American icons, and for a moment you almost believe
that it really happened.  It'll have you laughing and crying almost at the
same time.  For anyone that loves movies, Forrest Gump is definitely
something to buy and keep for your own...
