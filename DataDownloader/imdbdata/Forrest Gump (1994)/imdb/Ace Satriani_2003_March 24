...with class, wit, and genuine pathos, instead of the mawkish
tripe of
mercenary weepfests like Men of Honor, A Beautiful Mind and (gak) Pearl
Harbor. While the creators of such movies meticulously contrive each scene
to be a tear-jerking, heart-rending epiphany into the human spirit, the
makers of Forrest Gump set out to tell what is simply a great story of one
man's life, where all emotion is merely an honest by-product and nothing
more.
The movie's unique sense of humor makes it clear early on how it doesn't
plan to take its subject matter too seriously, and when the occasional
sentimental scene does crop up, it's executed in a way that is
surprisingly
not cloying or embarrassing. At all. Very un-Hollywood.<br /><br />Cliff notes version: Well written, well acted, well done.
10/10
