FORREST GUMP may be the worst movie ever to win a Best Picture Oscar.
It is one of the most manipulative, insulting, patronizing, hateful,
repugnant pieces of celluloid garbage I have ever had the displeasure
of watching ooze across the screen.<br /><br />The message of FORREST GUMP? Always do what you're told and never think
for yourself and you'll get rich. But be individualistic and live an
anti-establishment life and you'll get AIDS and die. That's this whole
sickening movie in a nutshell. <br /><br />Let's be fair, though. The performances are what got this movie it's
acclaim, and nothing else. Tom Hanks is superb, as are Gary Sinise,
Mykelti Williamson and Sally Field. Robin Wright, as usual, appears to
be reading from cue cards. The movie is well shot and there are some
breathtaking moments, as when Forrest is running past the Rocky
Mountains.<br /><br />On a technical note, I would love to castrate the SOB CGI artist who
attempts to change people's lips to match new dialog written for them.
And placing Hanks in newsreel footage over and over and over and over
again. It's simply annoying, and serves no purpose other then to make
us marvel at what they're capable of doing with special effects these
days.<br /><br />According to this movie, Elvis couldn't come up with his own dance
moves and John Lennon couldn't write &quot;Imagine&quot; without a little help
from this brain dead moron. The only semi-positive aspect I can take
from the movie's running joke of Gump creating many of our pop culture
staples is that anyone who is amused by them must be as stupid as he
is. There's a nice (and probably unintentional) satirical touch.<br /><br />FORREST GUMP is a right wing conservative propaganda film disguised as
a heartwarming family film. It glorifies corporate greed, trivializes
both Vietnam and the peace movement, and demonizes and lampoons anyone
who tries to shake up the system. I despise this movie. What happened
to Robert Zemeckis? This is the guy who gave us USED CARS, ROMANCING
THE STONE, BACK TO THE FUTURE and WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT.<br /><br />I liked you a lot more before you sold your soul, Bob.
