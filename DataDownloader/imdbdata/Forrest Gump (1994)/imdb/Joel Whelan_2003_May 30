Zemeckis' power horse &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; remains one of the most
intelligent, beautiful, and luckiest films that I have ever seen.
Although it runs a fair distance away from being a forerunner in the
competitive pack of masterpiece films, regardless &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is
placed in a great position. Released in 1994, a very strong year for
Hollywood, Zemeckis found his film dominating the Oscars, overcoming
two great films, particularly Tarantino's &quot;Pulp Fiction,&quot; and making a
very firm place within the universal consciousness.<br /><br />Certainly, the film would not be so special had Tom Hanks turned down
the role. Hanks, playing 'Forrest' acts as the Catalyst for the film,
playing in my opinion, one of the greatest performances of all time
(although irrespective of my Love for film, I judge my opinion on the
few films that I have seen). His southern American accent, glazed
expressions and his hunched apprehensive body language and posture,
demonstrate a truly unforgettable performance, which simply, made me
want more. The film uses very subtle special effects; so subtle in fact
that many viewers will come away trusting exactly what they saw,
although no emphasis whatsoever should be placed on the effects. They
help guide the characterization of 'Forrest', and emphasize his ironic
and imperative persona, although it really is not that type of film.
It's an emotionally thrilling, humorous and yet sometimes ridiculous
picture, accentuated by a beautiful score (and soundtrack), wonderful
cinematography and direction that to some extent, acts somewhat as a
brilliantly decorated family film.<br /><br />It is a lucky film, somewhat over hyped, yes. But it's also an
excellent piece of fiction, an excellent blend of film technology and
storytelling, and presents the world with a great representative of an
American, and I mean that in a good way. It is one of the better films
I've seen, and its one that I'm glad to recommend to anyone.<br /><br />**** Out of ***** (4 out of 5 stars.) <br /><br />Joel Whelan.
