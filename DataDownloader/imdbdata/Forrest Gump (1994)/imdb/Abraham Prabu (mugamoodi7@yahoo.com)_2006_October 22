what an amazing movie to knock the minds of those who get satisfied by
the well known Hollywood gimmicks which includes devastating graphics
and supernatural stories... When i sat to watch this movie i never
thought that its going to take me to a different world , the world of
forrest gump. Special credits to the writer for some wonderful dialoges
that pierces the heart of every viewer. its very hard to express by
words the life of Forrest Gump but thats the significance of that movie
that makes it so special. A simple movie to speak about the life of a
normal man attaining different characters at different stages but one
of the best movies to entertain you. i would suggest all to make this
movie as a prominent one in their DVD library. &quot;life is like a box of
chocolates you never know what you will get next&quot; thats right the movie
is an extraordinary example for these words.
