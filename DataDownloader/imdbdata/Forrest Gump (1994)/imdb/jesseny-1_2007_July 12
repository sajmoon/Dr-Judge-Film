Hanks and Senise are brilliant along with the rest of the cast. From
start to finish, most everyone will love this flick. I can&#39;t find fault
with this movie, and I am shocked by some of the negative comments on
this forum because it is a truly great film. I&#39;ve watched this movie at
least 10 times and I just love it. This movie is filled with all the
emotions done with precision. Just sit back and enjoy it. In some ways
it is so light on the outside and so profound in other ways. Gump is a
wonderful movie for all ages and is so very deep. You will die laughing
and also cry your eyes out. All you need is a pulse and you will love
this movie for ever. 10 out of 10! One of the most memorable movies of
all time.
