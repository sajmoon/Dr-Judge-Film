I haven't any idea where to begin with this wonderful, beloved classic.
&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; ranks as my favorite film of all time, and for many, many
reasons. Everything about this beautiful fable is compelling, engrossing,
endearing, and absolutely classic. From its memorable &quot;feather&quot; opening
scene, we are instantly acquainted with the simple,remarkable story of a
simple,lovable man,wisked away into 
the eyes of Forrest Gump. We learn about individuality (&quot;Don't ever let
anyone tell you you're different&quot;), values (&quot;Stupid is as stupid does&quot;),love
(&quot;I'm not a smart man... But I love you&quot;), and so many more honest,
appreciative qualities to life, all in the tale of a man who has experienced
life for everything it is worth, yet lacking the intellectual capacity to
conceive the significance of his life. The story takes us from the childhood
days of Forrest on his uncertain first ride to school, where he meets the
love of his life, Jenny (&quot;I had never seen anything so beautiful in my life.
She was like an angel&quot;), to his first ride of recruitment in the Vietnam
war, where he befriends his &quot;best good friend&quot; Bubba, to finally, taking his
own son, Forrest, to the busstop for his first day of school. The story has
been covered; now for my evaluative assessment. Everything in this film,
from the brilliant, sensible direction, to the incredibly touching Tom Hanks
as Forrest Gump, in perhaps the best performance in the history of cinema,
to the compassionate, understanding score, to the unforgettable screenplay
(As I write this review I am constantly tempted to quote a line from the
film), to the realistic visual effects (One would believe Forrest Gump had
actually existed with fame), to such delightful performances as Lieutenant
Dan, played hysterically by Gary Sinise, and etc. etc. etc. I cannot praise
this classic, unequaled, monumental film enough; suffice to say, everything
here is perfect, this film is excellent on practically every level, and I
have not stopped loving &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; since the first time I heard the
line, &quot;Life is like a box of chocolates&quot;. This film is an absolute treasure
which shines more and more every time you watch it. **** out of ****
