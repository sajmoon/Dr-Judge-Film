What can i say, another movie which shines through. A movie which deserved
all the awards it got and brought us closer to the wonderful acting of Tom
Hanks. Forrest Gump is amazing. Everything you could want in a movie Forrest
Gump has, from the laughter to the tears to the brilliant acting and
brilliant story-line and MORE. Robert Zemikis is such a wonderful director
and Tom Hanks being the brilliant actor that he is, was yet again truly
wonderful in this movie. A must see if you haven't seen the fantastic
Forrest Gump yet. BRILLIANT! 10/10!
