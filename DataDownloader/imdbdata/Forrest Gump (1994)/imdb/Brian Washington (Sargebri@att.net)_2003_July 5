This film is such a great document of many events that happened during my
lifetime.  Forrest reminds me a little bit of the childlike innocence set
against the backdrop of the turmoil and cynicism that permeated the country
during the latter half of the 20th century.  He was a simple man that was
thrown into extraordinary circumstances and faced them with an innocence
that many people no longer have.  However, while Forrest represented the
innocence of that era, Jenny represented the harsh reality.  Jenny's
character was pretty much shaped by the sexual, physical and mental abuse
she suffered as a child.  We see her move from relationship to relationship
and become involved in drugs, all the time growing up a very lonely person. 
All this comes to a head as she contracts the black plague of the last 20
years, AIDS.  This film is a very touching document of the second half of
the 20th century and rightly deserves to be praised not just for the
technical achievements, but for the wonderful and heartwarming story it
is.
