Dear Friends , I read all of these comments on Forrest Gump. I respect all
these views . As for my opinion I think I have never seen anything like
that. This was a perfect masterpiece. It would be very unjustified if I
praise the movie as its virtue needs no mention. I would rather take up the
criticisms expressed. First, Tom Hanks played Gump too brilliantly. Many
think that playing Psycho or fool is simple. It is not. Forrest is not
stupid. He is just not a ''SMART MAN'' as he himself knows. Gump is an
innocent Simpleton. None but Hanks could have done the justice to this
character. Second , it is not celebration of stupidity. It is depiction of
our imperfect world through the eyes and mind of Forrest. Everyone around
him is imperfect ,especially Jenny (we will come to her later). Forrest is
the master of his own time and fate.<br /><br />It would be very wrong to find didactic messages in the movie. It is a work
of art and should be savored and enjoyed instead of being analyzed. There
are some unbelievable episodes and incidents...But why should we murder the
beauty only to dissect and analyze ??? Call such parts as Celluloid
licenses. This is the movie that makes you laugh and cry at the same time.
Forrest's quotes such as , ''Life is a box of chocolates..'' should not be
put under scrutiny like quotes from Shakespeare or T.S. Elliot !! He
himself
says that his mum always tells him things the way he understands them...<br /><br />Now we come to Jenny. She does not have to be goddess. She is one of many
imperfect persons showed in the movie. She does love Forrest but is
embarrassed and reluctant to share her life with him. She keeps on telling
him that she has a life very different from his. Any person in Jenny's
place
would have done the same. But she has always loved him from childhood to
adulthood. In the end when she meets Forrest with a kid and a most Possibly
AIDS ,She assures him that she demands nothing from him and can support her
child. She is reformed after making mistakes all through her life and
learning from them. Maybe she got AIDS after she made love to Forrest and
maybe after she gave Birth to Forrest Jr. ? Anyway , this is perhaps the
biggest Celluloid license in the movie and we could ignore it.<br /><br />I do not have any particular favorite scenes in the movie as I love the
whole movie . But still if I have to mention ....I would say that the last
one when Forrest talks to Jenny while she rests in peace in her grave was
very touching. Interestingly her Epitaph describes her as the Wife and
mother of Forrest Gump, Which is very sweet and touching and true. And
Forrest again made me cry when he shows Jenny a letter from Forrest Junior
but moments later he made me laugh when he says that he is not going to
read
or open it because Junior wanted him not to ! :-) I will always love this
movie and this is the story of our own imperfect world in contrast with
Forrest's near perfect and most innocent world....almost an Arcadia of its
own kind.....<br /><br />
