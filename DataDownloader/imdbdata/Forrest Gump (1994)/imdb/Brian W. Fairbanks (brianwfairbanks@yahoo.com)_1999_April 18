Some of its critics say that &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is little more than a right
wing
fable whose message is &quot;Vote Republican.&quot;  Yes, Forrest is the embodiment
of
&quot;traditional values,&quot; a simpleton who worships God, honors his mother,
does
what he's told, and never asks questions.  Good old Forrest succeeds in
life
by embracing the values of mainstream society while  Jenny, the girl he
loves with a blind passion, pursues the fancy-free lifestyles in vogue at
each time period portrayed:  In the 1960s, she joins the counterculture,
strumming a guitar, smoking dope, dropping acid, and protesting the war in
Vietnam in which Forrest courageously fights.  In the 70s, while Forrest
is
a successful businessman, Jenny is a fast living, sexually promiscuous
member of the disco set.<br /><br />Forrest represents America, or, rather, the America that right wing
propagandists want everyone to believe is the true America.  Do what
you're
told, never talk back, and you'll be successful and happy.  Jenny, on the
other hand, epitomizes rebellion and the rejection of the unthinking way
of
life that the government would prefer we pursue.  Forrest is good.  Jenny
is
bad.  Forrest further strengthens his image of goodness by always, always,
ALWAYS taking Jenny back whenever her latest flirtations fail to fulfill
her.  Like Jesus, Forrest loves Jenny unconditionally, never questioning
her
lack of faithfulness.  Yes, this film says, America forgives all of you
long-haired, dope smoking, draft-dodging sex perverts, or we will if you
agree to shape up, and fast.  For Jenny, however, it was too late.  Once
she
settled down into a respectable middle-class life, her past caught up with
her.<br /><br />Of course, some people see the above interpretation  as hogwash.  They
maintain that &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is simply a fable promoting such tried and
true
values as honoring your parents and your God.  It's the story of innocence
uncorrupted by a greedy, frequently hateful and dishonest world.  No
matter
how evil the times, goodness can prevail.<br /><br />I must say I can relate to the criticisms; they have validity. But so do
the
arguments of those who champion the film.  It is with the latter group
that
I side, and Tom Hanks, more than anything else, is the reason.  Not since
James Stewart has an actor so believably portrayed kindness and decency.
Hanks makes this film work, and his performance can even help you overlook
the often awkward special-effects (the scene in which Forrest appears on
&quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; with John Lennon failed to convince).  I think
Morgan
Freeman deserved the Oscar that year for &quot;The Shawshank Redemption,&quot; but
of
all the people who took home Oscars for &quot;Forrest Gump,&quot; no one earned
theirs
more than Hanks.  I can't imagine another actor (a living one, anyway)
taking on this character and pulling it off as splendidly as he
did.
