A rating of 10 is way too small for Forrest! Tom Hanks had an amazing
part, played it amazingly, won on Oscar for it, the film itself won in
total 6 Oscars, what can we say more? :) I&#39;ve seen this film 11 times
from beginning to end, and I&#39;d like to watch it again for another 11
times, and then again and again. Words are simply not enough for the
storyline, the script is beautiful, music is brilliant, and the most
important fact, this movie simply touches one&#39;s heart.<br /><br />Do not be afraid to watch this film with your entire family, with your
grandma, with your dogs or cats, even with your neighbours if you can!
On high-definition TV, a Dolby Surround sound system and wide-screen
TV, Forrest Gump will show you what life is worth fighting for!!
