Granted, the story in this film is fanciful, but the superlative
performances of the central actors quickly captivates the viewer. In
particular, the main character, Forrest Gump, was superbly portrayed by
Tom Hanks, who made the character credible and endearing. Numerous
scenes were characterized by subtleties that were typical of the high
performance level. In particular was the scene in which the character
Forrest Gump learns that he fathered a son. The facial expressions and
body movements of Tom Hanks immediately conveyed the character&#39;s fears
that his son might also be retarded. It was a joy to watch such skill.
The scene in which his army buddy recites all the ways that shrimp
sandwiches can be made was genuinely funny.
