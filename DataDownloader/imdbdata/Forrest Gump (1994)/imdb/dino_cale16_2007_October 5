Forrest Gump is well, probably the best movie made by Hollywood. It
captures the aspects of everyday American life but of that of man who
has experienced war, met the president three times, met Elvis, John
Lennon, visited DC, was America&#39;s first ping pong champion, an American
philosophical slogan giver, and even a fit runner who ran across the
country. He is the All-American guy. It made you feel you were there in
60s when we landed on the moon, when Richard Nixon robbed the
Watergate, and when African-American were making the mark on America.
However despite it&#39;s emotional and innocent events it had some moments
like whe Jenny (god bless her soul even though she had done wrong) was
a prostitute, when JFK, George Wallace, Lennon, and more were shot, and
even when Forrest&#39;s mom had to sleep with a school principal so Forrest
could make it in life brang out the dark and dirty points of our nation
and leaves feeling a little guilty for how society is. This is why I
only give &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; a 9. I still like when he says &quot;Big Bubblegum
Shrimp&quot;
