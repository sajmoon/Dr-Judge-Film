I absolutely LOVE this movie!!! In my personal opinion it is the
greatest movie of all time. It has such a sweet story and Tom
Hanks is miraculous in it. If you haven't seen this movie than...
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?! Go rent it!! It's definitely worth the
time. You won't regret seeing such a beautifully written, acted and
put together movie. Not only is the story great but the visuals that
they put together with the script is awesome too. Also there are
beautiful voice overs in it. One of the best movies with voice overs.
Tom Hanks is a brilliant actor and you can truly see that in this
movie. FORREST GUMP ROCKS!!
