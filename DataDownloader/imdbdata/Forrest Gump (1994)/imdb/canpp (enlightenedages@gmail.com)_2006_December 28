Robert Zemeckis has done a credible job with this morality play. Tom
Hanks portrays a dim-witted, but practical, man who has good luck on
his side.<br /><br />It is a story of a seemingly simple man, who has a great deal of
practical sense and his seemingly complicated life.<br /><br />The film is a character study not only of Hank&#39;s character, but, a
character study of the people in his orbit. The big influences in
Forrest Gump&#39;s life are is his mother and his best a friend, a girl who
suffered at the hands of an abusive father who lived on the edge and
eventually would have fallen off it had it not been for Forrest&#39;s
gentle spirit and his Vietnam War buddy, Bubba, also a slow-witted, but
kindly man who befriends Forrest and the two forge a solid friendship
in a short period of time. whereby its influences affect Forrest&#39;s life
long after Bubba&#39;s untimely death in Vietnam.<br /><br />Forrest deals with love, romantic, maternal and platonic, hate, war&#133;the
effects such as Forrest meeting President Kennedy are pretty neat. In
dealing with life, Forrest deals with the complications of life in the
most practical matter and it serves him and those around him well.<br /><br />The film&#39;s message is rather simple, no matter what life brings to your
doorstep, there are only solutions, no problems.<br /><br />I personally liked the film, but, I do think the film is very
over-rated because those who are of politically correct mindset make a
large point of pointing out the morality play&#39;s message of hope. On a
scale of 1-10, 10 being a miracle, I give the film a solid 5.
