For me it&#39;s one of the best movies I have ever seen. But I wanted to
say something else. <br /><br />I&#39;ve just read book (Forrest Gump of course) and I&#39;m very impressed.
This book is not as good as movie and I admire someone (Zemeckis? or
somebody) who read it, removed sub-plots almost like from cartoon
(spaceship, living in the jungle etc.), changed few things (meeting
with Bubba, Dan), added (cross-country running, hint about Apple etc.)
and made such a cool script. <br /><br />Finding book which is decent and changing it to Oscar-winning movie is
something what I like. In opposite to few movies (i.e godfather?) when
book is genius and it&#39;s just remade to movie (2 chapters removed is not
much of work).
