Hello everyone! I'm Daniel Galvalizi and I am here to give my opinion about
my favorite movie, named Forrest Gump. I do believe this movie deserves
every award that it won.<br /><br />I think Tom Hanks's character is played excellent. He always played
character very well, but this one was just great.
And i've also got to say, that Sally Field and Gary Snise are the best
supporting actors i ever watched. They are also very well.<br /><br />I love the Forrest Gump's script. It's very good!! And the direccion was
pretty good too.<br /><br />Finally, i think Forrest Gump show us the american way in his best and
greatest form; and this movie make us think about what is really important
in life. God bless Forrest Gump!<br /><br />
