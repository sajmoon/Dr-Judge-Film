1999_April 7 

I don't get it. Not a bad movie, but I must have missed something, I do not
understand why all the hype or why it is considered a 'great' movie. The
emperor has no clothes. A couple of laughs, I guess a nice message about
living a life with quiet dignity, and a bunch of absurd and nonsensical
stuff thrown in for no apparent reason. Interesting when shining a light on
the destructive, hypocritical, and hedonistic underside of the 60's
movements, should have kept it going instead of getting too
silly.
