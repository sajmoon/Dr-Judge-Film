This film is one of the best films ever. Its about a guy(male) called
Forrest Gump and he had so called braces on his legs,he wasn't very
good at making friends but there was a girl called jenny who was indeed
very friendly who said &quot;you can sit here if ya want&quot; which i found very
sweet.In one bit of the film it showed young Forrest and jenny kinda
bonding and teaching each other things. Somes parts of the film were
very emotional(sad) but mostly i cried of happiness.Great film to watch
i also recommend &quot;rain man and one flew over the cuckoo's nest&quot;. So if
your reading right NOW go watch Forrest Gump!! I also recommend these
Tom Hank films.......<br /><br />the terminal cast away the green mile Road to Perdition Saving Private
Ryan and he dose a good job as woody in toy story 1 &amp; 2.
