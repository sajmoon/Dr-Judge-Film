Forrest Gump is my favorite film ever, and in my opinion the greatest
film of all time. That's right, I said of all time. It has everything:
romance, drama, war, and comedy. Tom Hanks is among the greatest actors
ever and definitely the best in the last twenty years. Robert Zemeckis
is very good at what he does, although he has made some movies that
weren't up to par for him (What Lies Beneath...Ew). He is a great
director, and I would've retired after this film if I were him. I've
seen this film countless times, probably over three hundred, and I
think I enjoy it more every time I watch it. The composition of the
scenes are great, the interaction between characters and overall
character development is superb, and it truly captures a point in time
that many baby-boomers can truly appreciate. I really do think it is
the greatest film I've ever seen or will see.
