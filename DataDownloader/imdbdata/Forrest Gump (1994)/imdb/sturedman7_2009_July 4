gonna keep this short cos&#x27; I could write about this movie all day,
there&#x27;s just so much to talk about! an amazing film that tells an
amazing story about an amazing man, forrest gump has got it all: a
brilliant cast, a wonderful score, arguably the best soundtrack of all
time, and so many emotional highs and lows.great special effects too,
and the Vietnam section is better than 99% of the movies that actually
centre on the Vietnam war.<br /><br />lots of laugh out loud moments, and I love the direction by the master
of all things fantastical, Robert Zemeckis.<br /><br />what a movie!
