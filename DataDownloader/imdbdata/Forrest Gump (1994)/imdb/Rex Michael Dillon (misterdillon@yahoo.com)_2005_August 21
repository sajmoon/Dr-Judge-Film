Well, if you are in the mood for a hollow &quot;feel good movie&quot; this will
fit the bill. But if you are looking for substance, or a film that
makes you think, this film will leave you knowing you can never get the
time back you just spent watching this movie. The soundtrack probably
causes movie-goers to connect to the film more than the flimsy plot.<br /><br />At the time this film was released, Hanks was perhaps the most sought
after leading man. In some ways, it is as though the studios were on a
quest to turn him into his generation's Jimmy Stewart. Hanks is a solid
actor, and has acted in many excellent roles, but this is not one of
them. But this film certainly helped launch the &quot;Bubba Gump Shrimp
Company Restaurant&quot; found at tourist traps all across the United
States. In many ways, that is this film's legacy - made for theater
tourist looking for a vacation for the mind.
