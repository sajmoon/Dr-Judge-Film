frankly speaking, given that an average Asian people person entrenched
with conservative and Confucian ideology in comparison with Westerners
in particular, i really sense somewhat awkward for not appreciating
this movie way thoroughly although i truly consider it should be a
glorious showdown of self-righteous high social status dudes versus
underdogs advocated and mocked by fates or certain &quot;papacy&quot; when
destiny displays a hideous face.as far as i am weightlessly
concerned,tom hanks delivers an incredible portrayal of a veteran who
unfortunately is a imbecile,meanwhile his slightly overbearing mother
somehow manages to be impeccable and pushy despite the fact that her
son happens to be physically and psychologically handicapped. all the
tragical climax culminates when gump's little son was born and his
overdosed wife passed away. you can clearly see the shock of
middle-class populace wrestles with life and struggles to keep track
with others pace,,however,i remain sort of suspicious why the general
tempo and rhyme of the movie goes so smoothly and peacefully, i am also
not able to totally understand the humor permeating throughout the
whole movie,the genre of which to my knowledge belongs to unique
Americanism.by no means to be offensive but it is destitute of emotive
burst and spicy aggression which is vital to vivify the whole movie.
