I liked this one.
A mentally challenged man meets presidents Kennedy and Nixon, serves in
Vietnam, becomes a shrimp guru, discovers the truth about Watergate...all
the while he never loses sight or stops looking for the one thing that is
most important to him, the love of his girl Jenny.
It might have its flaws, but what film doesn't? The cast is first-rate, and
Mr. Hanks gives a great performance worthy of the Oscar he
received.
*** out of ****
