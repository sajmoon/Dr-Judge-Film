This film is brilliant maybe i like this because it goes through his life
which i always love or maybe it is the great acting by tom hanks as
usual.The film ended up winning the best picture at the 1994 oscars in a
year full of great but some times wierd films like 'pulp fiction' and the
slow 'shawshank redemption'. Anyway the film was well acted and very
interesting.
