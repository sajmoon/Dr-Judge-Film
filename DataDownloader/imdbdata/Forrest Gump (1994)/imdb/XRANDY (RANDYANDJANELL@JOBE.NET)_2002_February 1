The Germans have a word for events that appear to be the result of a joke
played by fate or history.  It is called treppenwitz.  I don't know if the
filmmakers were aware of this word, but they sure knew how to use the spirit
of it.  Treppenwitz pervades the many vicissitudes of the title character as
his naivet&eacute; impels him not only through his own life, but also through many
critical moments in history.  But, where many quirky takes on history
dissolve into a one-joke show, `Forrest Gump' endears us, because of the
touching nature of its simple protagonist.  As the story slips in and out of
historical tableaus we focus not on the famous persons, but on Forrest,
because only one as credulous as he could examine these happening
impartially.<br /><br />Forrest could have been annoying, with his inane likeability and
sententiousness.  But we realize that while we condescend to the verities
that Forrest espouses, he is uncynical enough to find the implicit truth
within them.  His simple nature is easy to admire, and perhaps even envy. 
Though only anecdotal, I have noticed that people who are concerned with the
simpler aspects of life seem generally happier than others.  His
credulousness serves as a sort of aloofness over many of life's drearier
aspects.<br /><br />The bottom line is that I simply like films like this; low-key epics with
the right mix of comedy, drama, and bits of history thrown in.  I'm not a
big special effects buff, but here they are relevant in putting Forrest in
the past, so I appreciate the work, and once more sing the praises of the
magic of Hollywood.
