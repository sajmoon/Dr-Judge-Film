There must be a lot of Forrest Gump types who vote on this web-site,
because
this has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. I saw this movie in
the theatre, and my wife and I kept turning to each other and wondering
what
everyone thought was so funny about this movie. I remember one line from
this movie, and it's not the one that everyone else remembers. &quot;Stupid is
as
stupid does&quot;, that's just how I felt after this movie, when I realised that
I just wasted 6 bucks on this piece of crap.
