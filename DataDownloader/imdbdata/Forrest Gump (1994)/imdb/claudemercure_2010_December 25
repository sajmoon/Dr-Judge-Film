Entertaining comedy/drama/fantasy has a lot to keep you busy (and
excellent special effects), but doesn&#x27;t measure up to its epic
pretensions. It would&#x27;ve benefited from sticking to comedy and
eschewing sentiment. Instead it pushes every button imaginable to jerk
a reaction out of the viewer, and tries to dictate your emotions with a
pushy music score. The movie lapses into silliness at times, and is
self-indulgent for the last hour. Director Robert Zemeckis attempts to
evoke each era by illustrating its clich&#xE9;s and by scoring it to a
procession of over-familiar songs that serve as lazy, embarrassingly
obvious signifiers of their times (Sweet Home Alabama, Hound Dog,
Blowin&#x27; in the Wind, California Dreamin&#x27;, For What it&#x27;s Worth, On the
Road Again, Mrs. Robinson, etc.). I love a lot of those songs, but
they&#x27;ve become clich&#xE9;s themselves by now. Tom Hanks is funny and
convincing in the title role, but Forrest is too much of an invincible
saint to be very interesting.
