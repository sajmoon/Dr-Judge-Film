Forrest Gump, born in the 1940s, has a limited intelligence, but an
unlimited heart. By following his heart he accidentally became
successful : he managed to go to college because he could run fast and
was dragged into playing football, go to the Vietnam war, meet John F.
Kennedy, win Ping Pong championship in China, become rich by fishing
shrimps and buying stocks from the Microsoft company. Yet all that time
he didn&#39;t care about that at all. He only wanted to gain the love from
his childhood love, Jenny. Evidently, she appears one day at his door
step, desperate for money&#133; <br /><br />Both &#132;Forrest Gump&quot; and &#132;Being There&quot; are ideologically identical films
which are dead set at proving one point: all you need in life is luck.
It&#39;s as simple as that. Both have retarded heroes that manage to become
successful in life just by being at the right time at the right place.
And both are great movies, although &#132;Being There&quot; is unfortunately not
nearly as popular. &#132;Forrest Gump&quot;, winner of 6 Oscars and 3 Golden
Globes, is an extremely emotional roller-coaster with an tremendously
naive and gentle hero that you just can&#39;t have the heart to hate. Such
sequences, like the one where the 10-year old Forrest started running
for the first time in his life, breaking those metal braces for his
legs he had to wear because he couldn&#39;t walk properly, were so magical
they sent shivers down my spine.<br /><br />--------------- <br /><br />Robert Zemeckis directs the story in a form of a vivid fairytale, not
always managing to keep it logical ( would Forrest&#39;s mom really let her
son go to the Vietnam war? Could Forrest really run from the east coast
of the USA to the west coast? ) or consistent ( stiff ending, and come
to think of it, Bill Murray would have been much better as Forrest Gump
), but still letting the positive opinion prevail, and even cleverly
playing with history, stating how small often inspire the big ( like
when Forrest met John Lennon in a talk show and caused him to say the
words like &#132;Imagine all those people&quot;, &#132;No religion too?&quot;. We all knew
where that was going ). Many have criticized this film, calling it too
pathetic, racist and even politically dubious, but I don&#39;t share that
opinion. After seeing it I was left amazed, and that&#39;s the only thing
that matters. &#132;Forrest Gump&quot; is together with &#132;Schindler&#39;s List&quot;,
&#132;Groundhog Day&quot;, &#132;Dances with Volwes&quot;, &#132;Rushmore&quot; and &#132;Saving Private
Ryan&quot; one of the best films of the 90s. And yet I still can&#39;t shake
that feeling away that &#132;Being There&quot; should get more credit for the
success of this film.<br /><br />Grade: 10/10
