What a load of sentimental nonsense, I mean really! How can we
celebrate the unremarkable life of such a tragic simpleton? I&#39;ve heard
one misguided fool remark that this was a &quot; truly great film &amp; that&#39;s
why it won so many awards &quot;. Well, if they presented awards for time
wasting, mediocre, uninspired, brainless drivel then Forrest Gump would
be the undisputed champion of the celluloid world! Everything about
this equals cinematic dogs mess, from Robert Zemeckis sloppy, gormless
direction to Alan Silvestri&#39;s soulless,largely grating musical score,
not to mention Hanks hollow &amp; irritating portrayal of a
drooling,chocolate-offering,life advice-giving mental case. I, Big
Ol&#39;Alex Davies, found this film to be an insult to my superior
intelligence &amp; even my boyfriend, who has broader taste than I, thought
of it as nothing more than sappy cat vomit.
