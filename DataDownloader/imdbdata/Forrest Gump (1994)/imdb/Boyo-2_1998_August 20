1998_August 20 
Did I see the same movie as the rest of the world? I thought this movie
was lousy. It couldn&#39;t have been less interesting. <br /><br />The only thing that got me was how they made Gary Sinise&#39;s legs
disappear; and that was a momentary curiosity at best, an interesting
f/x. That was very well done, no question about it.<br /><br />I am very sentimental, at least when it comes to movies; this movie
didn&#39;t touch me at all. <br /><br />Tom Hanks was obnoxious, at best. Robin Wright Penn is miscast and I
have yet to see her in a movie in which she should have been in. I love
Sally Field but even she cannot rescue this for me.<br /><br />This may be the movie I dislike the most...the fact that it won Best
Picture, Actor etc. makes me hate it even more, and usually I don&#39;t
care what the Academy thinks since I question the whole thing to begin
with.
