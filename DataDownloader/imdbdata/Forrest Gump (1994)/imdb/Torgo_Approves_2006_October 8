(r#79)<br /><br />I would lie if I said that Forrest Gump isn&#39;t an extremely well made
movie. From the acting, to the feel-good story, to the pacing, comic
timing, and fantastic soundtrack, it is one of the best movies ever
made. Tom Hanks is good as the titular character, and Gary Sinise and
Robin Wright Penn make for a strong supporting cast. Robert Zemeckis&#39;
direction hits all the right notes. The movie is also visually
beautiful. So why did I only give it a 7 out of 10? Well, as well
produced, directed and acted as the film is, there is an underlying
cynicism that doesn&#39;t work well with the movie&#39;s innocent and
good-hearted nature. The &quot;heart-breaking&quot; scenes become more and more
obvious and deliberate with each viewing. Don&#39;t get me wrong, this is a
great feel-good story and I did love it when I was younger. Maybe I am
just growing more desensitized to this kind of warm-hearted, mushy
stuff. The problem probably lies more with me than with the film
itself, but I still can&#39;t help but feel that Zemeckis was a bit too
elaborate. There are scenes that, when you&#39;re re-watching the film,
seem written specifically to make the audience crack up in tears. It
borders on being manipulative, rather than letting the audience think
for itself.<br /><br />The movie could have worked as a serious drama. I&#39;m a sucker for movies
about mentally challenged men and I loved both &quot;Sling Blade&quot; and the
more obscure &quot;Den Enfaldige M&ouml;rdaren&quot;. In the former, Billy Bob
Thornton delivered a total class act. He embodied his character, Karl,
to the point where you couldn&#39;t possibly compare him to his role in,
say, Bad Santa. In &quot;Den Enfaldige M&ouml;rdaren&quot;, Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd was also
utterly believable. But I just can&#39;t buy Hanks in this role, even if
it&#39;s probably the one he&#39;ll be remembered for. Thornton and Skarsg&aring;rd,
in their respective roles, *were* their characters. They were as human
and real as you and me. Hanks&#39; performance is a pure live-action
cartoon, a caricature of a mentally challenged man. He&#39;s just too
goody-goody. Too pure of heart. Too goofy and lovable. He&#39;s a man with
no dark sides, and as such he&#39;s completely unbelievable. I did laugh at
Gump&#39;s cute lines and catchphrases. I did feel for him when he got
bullied around and when he finally got the girl in the end. But I
wonder if anyone actually bought Gump as a character rather than just
&quot;Tom Hanks playing a mentally challenged guy&quot;.<br /><br />Another problem is that the movie refuses to take any real risks. There
is nothing controversial about the subject matter and nothing really
inventive about the movie-making (although it is quite an achievement
to fit an entire lifetime into a single film!) &#39;Gump&#39; is not a movie
that pushes the envelope in any way.<br /><br />This is still a very enjoyable movie and first-timers will probably
love it. It took a lot of viewings for me before my strong feelings for
it started to falter. On the surface, &quot;Gump&quot; is one of the best
feel-good movies ever made. But if you read between the lines, it is a
cynical and very elaborate movie, nearly manipulative, and specifically
designed to make you laugh, cry and pay for repeated cinema viewings.
At least Hanks and Sinise do their best.
