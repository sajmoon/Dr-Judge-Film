i saw Forrest Gump when I was 11 (year 2000). I was in love with the
movie. The movie touched me deeply. The movie is one of the finest and
most beautiful movies EVER MADE. I recommend this movie.Its a
masterpiece.I t will be ever remembered............ For me its a dream
or may be more than a Dream.<br /><br />It deserves 10/10 ... perfect movie.. (I like Forest gum and Shawshank
Redemption equally. they both are in my favorite movies)<br /><br />if u see this flick i m sure u gonna love it, the movie contains all
kind of material... i just love the movie. After 2-3 years movie
ratings will be at 8.8-9.0 and may a place of 1.2 .3 ....
