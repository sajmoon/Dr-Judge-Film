Forrest Gump will be a forever timeless movie. There is much to love about
this film and it fully deserves its place as one of the altime top movies
around. I've been reading some imdb reviews and most agree.<br /><br /> Of coarse Hanks was magnificent-when I think of Forrest I don't think of
him as even being a movie character, he was so lifelike. I guess thats the
mark of a great actor when they can create a character that lives forever in
our hearts.<br /><br /> This movie had an innocence about it-an idealism that I loved-I loved
watching the changing face of the country as time went by and I thought
Robin Wright Penn was also magnificent-Some people have mentioned the
movieis not true to life. Isn't it? Every day there's another story about
someone who makes it against all odds. I'm not saying the things that happen
to forrest happen to all these people-but -in a time when most &quot;news
stories&quot; are about violence and crime and people who DON'T make
it-occasionally one hears the stories of hope-people who aren't given all or
ANY the breaks who SOMEHOW-have the strength and perseverence to carve out
their own niche. Unfortunately, the reason we don't hear these stories that
much is because they aren't given the attention they should get. I had heard
once(don't know if this is 100 percent accurate) about a newspaper or
magazine that once only reported about good and remarkable occurences-and
wound up going out of business! Oh well....<br /><br /> The point is, I think this movie is VERY  important because it has the
ability to inspire. And in the times we live in that is always a good thing.
