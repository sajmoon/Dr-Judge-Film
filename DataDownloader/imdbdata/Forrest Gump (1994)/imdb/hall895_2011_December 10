Few, if any, characters in movie history have had an amazing a life as
Forrest Gump. He&#x27;s such a simple man. Stupid? Stupid is as stupid does.
Forrest may be a little slow. But he gets life, he knows what&#x27;s
important. He remains true to himself, to his values. He is fiercely
loyal to those he loves. And as Forrest himself says, though he is not
a smart man he knows what love is. Just by doing what he knows in his
heart to be right this simple man has the most incredible life. His
journey is magical, inspiring, heartwarming. It&#x27;s dramatic, it&#x27;s funny,
it&#x27;s poignant, it&#x27;s mesmerizing. Forrest Gump touches the lives of so
many people around him. And along the way he changes the course of
world events too. This is a life which has to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />So how does an Alabama boy with an IQ of 75 end up changing the world?
Just by being himself. Life happens all around him and Forrest is often
blissfully ignorant. He finds himself caught up in one extraordinary
situation after another. In each situation, without fail, he just does
the right thing, the good thing. He does what &#x22;smarter&#x22; people, given
the opportunity to think about the situation, might not. He thinks not
of the consequences, he just follows his heart. And that heart takes
him to the most amazing places. He is a man driven by love. Love for
his friends, for his mama, and above all for his beloved Jenny.<br /><br />The story of Forrest and Jenny is inspiring and tragic, heartwarming
and heartbreaking all at the same time. From their first meeting as
children the bond between these two is unbreakable. No matter how they
may drift apart that connection is always there. And drift apart they
do for while Forrest has his amazing life&#x27;s journey Jenny has a journey
all her own. She embraces life in her own way. In confronting her
demons she makes some bad choices. No matter how far gone she may seem
to be she knows, and we know, that Forrest will always be there for
her. Forrest doesn&#x27;t judge her as so many others would. He just loves
her, always and forever, no matter how hard she makes it to love her at
times. It really is one of the great relationships in movie history.<br /><br />The relationship between Forrest and Jenny is the real heart of the
story but there&#x27;s so much more. With everything Forrest experienced
it&#x27;s remarkable that director Robert Zemeckis managed to cram it all
into less than two and a half hours of film. And give credit to
Zemeckis too for creating the right tone for the film. In the wrong
hands this could have been an overly sentimental mess of a film. But in
Forrest Gump Zemeckis presents a film, and a character, which is good
but not too good to be true. So many outrageous things happen to
Forrest Gump but you believe in this story every step of the way.
Zemeckis put all the pieces together perfectly. Everything fits, right
down to the wonderful soundtrack with the perfect songs for each of the
big moments in Forrest&#x27;s decades-long journey. A great share of the
credit for the film&#x27;s success of course goes to Tom Hanks who played
Forrest to perfection. An obviously challenging character to play. How
far do you go in portraying Forrest&#x27;s innate simplicity? Hanks got it
just right. The rest of the cast is terrific as well. Robin Wright hits
all the right emotional notes in playing the deeply troubled Jenny.
Sally Field is everything you would want your mama to be. Mykelti
Williamson brings great personality to the role of Forrest&#x27;s wartime
buddy Bubba. Michael Conner Humphreys and Hanna Hall are wonderfully
endearing as the young Forrest and Jenny. And Gary Sinise is utterly
brilliant in playing Lieutenant Dan, a character whose story arc is as
dramatic and compelling as can be. Hanks of course won an Oscar for his
performance, which was pretty much a given as soon as the film was
released. That Sinise didn&#x27;t pick up an Oscar as well for his
supporting role seems borderline criminal. What a performance he gave
in a supremely challenging role.<br /><br />Much was made upon the film&#x27;s initial release about the effects used to
insert Forrest Gump into history. The effects may seem quaint by now
but they were truly revolutionary at the time. And they add a nice
touch to the movie. It&#x27;s cute seeing Forrest tell JFK he has to go pee
or to see him chatting with John Lennon. All of Forrest&#x27;s brushes with
history give the movie a grander scale. They show the impact this very
simple man had on the world. But for all the famous people he met, for
all the wondrous things he did, Forrest would be the first to tell you
that everything he ever needed was right there at home in Greenbow,
Alabama. His friends, his mama, his Jenny. That&#x27;s all Forrest Gump ever
needed. And look at the impact he had on those closest to him, often
without even trying. Look at where Lieutenant Dan is in life by the end
of the film. Forrest got him there just by being himself, by doing what
was right. And Forrest was of course always there for Jenny too. Such a
simple man yet he touched so many lives. Not a smart man? Listen to
what Forrest has to say about destiny in the incredibly poignant scene
near the film&#x27;s end. Maybe Forrest Gump had us all fooled. He may have
been the smartest one of all.
