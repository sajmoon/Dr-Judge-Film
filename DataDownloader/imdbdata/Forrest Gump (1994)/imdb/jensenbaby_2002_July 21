to all you people who hate this movie: what is wrong with you?  Do you have
any feelings at all?  Ok, I know Forrest is supposed to be kind of retarded
but can't you overlook that?  Can't you see the beauty and the inspiration
of this movie?  Forrest Gump is an excellent movie, one that I'll never,
EVER get tired of.  Every time I see it, it just gets better and better.  It
hurts to see that some people just do not have any feelings or
sentimentality.
