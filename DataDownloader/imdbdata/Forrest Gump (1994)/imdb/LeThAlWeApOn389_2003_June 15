Tom Hanks, once again, at the top of his game. Acting was incredible.
Forrest Gump is a triumph! Deserving of all awards won. Robert Zemekis
gives
viewers a chance to see life in a different way. Tom Hanks was fanastic
and
I recommend to all viewers this extraordinary movie that will stay in our
hearts for a life time.
