In truth, I&#39;m not a huge fan of Tom Hanks - films such as &quot;Big&quot; have
left me cold - but the first time I saw Forrest Gump I went out of the
cinema, bought another ticket and went straight back in. Hanks is
fantastic in the lead role, he lends a tremendous sense of reality to
the role of the social outcast that is Forrest Gump.<br /><br />What&#39;s great about this movie is that there&#39;s undoubtedly something in
it for everyone. Love, humour, history and war all come together in
this cinematic masterpiece. Some of the historical allusions are
executed perfectly. I won&#39;t mention any as they are some of the best
parts of the film, but anyone with any knowledge at all of American
popular history will love this film.<br /><br />Some of the war scenes are a little graphic, but certainly not to the
extent of other films such as &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; etc. Besides, the
military moments just endear you yet more to Gump.<br /><br />If you can, you must see this movie - there is NO way you will be
disappointed!
