It doesn't really surprise me that so many people think Forrest Gump is a
great film... it only reconfirms my feelings about the average filmgoer.
Simply a poor man's Zelig (that's another film for those who don't know)
that's been dumbed down to reach the television audience. Anyone who really
believes that &quot;Life's like a box of chocolates...&quot; is too naive to even be
reached...yeah, life's like a box of chocolates if some of the selections
were confections and some excrement. Don't mean to sound bitter but live a
half century (with your eyes open!) and see if you don't agree...by the way
what type of chocolate did it taste like to you when you saw the world trade
center collapse? Gump is Gomer Pyle who can't sing...and before you rush to
defend...it's been 10 years and what were Zemeckis' other great
films?
