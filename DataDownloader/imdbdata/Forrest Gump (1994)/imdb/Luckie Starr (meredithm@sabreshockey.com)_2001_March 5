I adore this movie. The casting was exceptional, especially Sally Field and
Robin Wright Penn. The soundtrack fit perfectly. The only thing is, I don't
believe many people actually understand what Forrest Gump is about. Many see
it as a sentimental story among the backdrop of the late twentieth century,
complete with events like the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights movement, the
Disco Era, the AIDS scare, ect. Actually, this film is a spoof on reality. I
came up with this theory the first time I watched it, and have since heard
similar comments from the director, Robert Zemekis. It is absurd how a man
from a small town in the deep south with an IQ of 75 can become so entangled
in American history - becoming a war hero, meeting several presidents,
playing ping-pong in China. It's really a comment on American life. In a
way, Forrest Gump represents a skewed version of Everyman. That, along with
everything I have already mentioned, makes this a brilliant and wonderful
film. If you have never thought of this before, try watching the film with
this theory in mind. I promise you'll see it in a different way.
