1999_February 2 

First, I'd like to say that this movie is formidably made. Referring to
acting, storyline and the astonishing FX I couldn't do more than repeating
things other admirers of FG have already said. It's got all in it: comedy,
romance and the fuel a movie needs to work: the &quot;I wonder how it'll all
end!&quot; that keeps (most of) the audience with this character throughout this
quite long film.<br /><br />I can't agree with the points often critizised about FG. And, honestly, I
think that the less subtle the critics are, the more hurt is their U.S.
patriotism.
First, If you wonder if something is realistic here, you should stop
watching movies. One good thing about FG is, that it isn't supposed to be
realistic, though it almost convinces you that it is, but it is far too
overdone to be so. It is meant to be a fable, like Benigni's &quot;La vita e
bella&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;Stupid is as stupid does&quot; is to my mind the key word throughout the movie.
Forrest Gump stumbles through world history (though only the United States
are shown, but Hollywood usually supposes them to be the world so the movie
has to be seen more in general than it's usual critics do) and what he sees
makes only sense to a dim-whitted who doesn't let himself get stirred by
events: Politicians are shot at(though no one elects better ones),
Leutenants seek death in battle, &quot;running as fast as the wind&quot; is regarded
as sufficient to get a collegue-degree and somebody who wants to change the
world ends up in a terrible mess, having somehow missed the point. So we all
do stupid often enough, society does and even America does
like the rest of the world.
Just Forrest doesn't.(Except towards Jenny, but that's a completely
different thing, that's love.)He has only an IQ of 75 but he is the only one
who behaves in a way we would like to expect from everyone (though we surely
don't want them to talk like that). He has nothing to base his actions upon
than his common sense and that shows us how far we've come apart from our
ideal of rational behaviour.<br /><br />In the end one word to those who hated the film for Jenny's death of AIDS
which they regarded as punishment,decreed by an reactionary movie: to my
mind, Jenny's death is not ideology, it's tragedy, though it also conveys
the basic idea of the movie. We won't get a better world by revolutions or
drugs, we only achieve it if more people would do like Forrest, even when
they have a higher IQ.
