&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; Tom Hanks ( Sleepless in Seattle) is one of my favorite
characters in all the movies that I have ever seen. That covers a lot of
movies.  Every time I watch the movie,  I start talking like Forrest,
Forrest Gump. His transparency, his sincerity, his naivete, his sense of
commitment toward his friends is beyond what anyone could imagine. We
watched the movie again when we were visiting relatives for Thanksgiving.
Uncle Gene was cracking up. He is a WWII veteran.  He loved that line: &quot;I
got a million dollars wound but so far I have not seen one cent of it!&quot;
After two days of talking like Forrest, Forrest Gump,  my husband looked
at
me and said: &quot;now you sound like Katharine Hepburn.&quot;
I think that one the reasons that I adore and understand Forrest is
because
he &quot;lived&quot; through my years as a young adult. The script is brilliant!
Clever, clever, clever!
The movie touches everyone. The older folks, because they lived through it
as adults; baby bloomers because they lived through it as young adults;
even
the kids in my neighborhood will scream: &quot; run,  Forrest, run.&quot; Every time
they see someone running.
My favorite quote: Bubba Blue, Mykelti Williamson (Primary Colors) said:
&quot;Anyway, like I was saying', shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can
barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, sautee it. Dey's uh,
shrimp-kabobs,
shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo. Pan fried, deep fried, stir-fried. There's
pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp, shrimp
soup,
shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp
sandwich. That- that's about it.&quot;.
My favorite scenes: Forrest showing his buttocks to the President. When he
sees &quot;Jeannie&quot; (Message in the Bottle) in Washington, D.C., they meet at
the
pool of the ellipse. They were again briefly like peas and carrots!
Forrest
sees &quot;Lieutenant Dan&quot; Gary Senise (Apollo 13), he jumps into the ocean and
his boat crashes! The little feather that flies at the beginning and end
of
movie. The music is great!
This is one of the best movies ever made and that is all I have to say
about
that!<br /><br />
