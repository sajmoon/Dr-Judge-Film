1999_October 12 

The best thing in this movie is Gary Sinise. He growls, smirks, and spits
his way through a terrific performance before his character is converted to
Forrest's religion. Other than that, there's not much meat in this movie. I
thought Hanks was pretty good as Gump, but it's not a role that you can
screw up too badly because there's very little character to slip into.<br /><br />The biggest problem with it is the artificial, plastic directing job,
something that other Zamekis productions suffer from also. The sequence of
dying Lt. Dan ancestors is particularly egregious - it's supposed to be
funny, I think, but doesn't quite make it. I'm also at a loss to explain why
we needed the Gump within a Gump voiceover narration. It only adds to the
syrupy tone with the kind of pseudo-humor you see in many TV commercials.
This story could have told itself quite well without this and similar
directorial tricks.<br /><br />I was a little bit bothered by the right-wing sensibilities present, but not
all that much. I'm used to the co-opting of counter-culture product to prove
alternate ideals (like the idea behind John Lennon's &quot;Imagine&quot;). Using a
false history as a dramatic device is OK with me, just do something
interesting with it. Hollywood has a tendency to de-legitimize creativity as
merely the accident of situation. Zamekis has done this before in Back to
the Future, where Chuck Berry supposedly gets his inspiration for &quot;Johnny B.
Good&quot; from one performance (instead of years of hard work). I hate it when
this is used for a joke - and not a very good one, usually. Just like many
things in this movie, it's pandering to the nostalgia of the audience.
Similar things are done to Bear Bryant. But I digress.<br /><br />The best scene in the movie is when Hanks sees Sinise at the dock and runs
into the water to greet him. It sums up both characters beautifully. And
despite (or maybe because of) the heavy borrowing from other movies, other
good scenes are the barroom scene with Hanks and Sinise, the orgasm scene,
and the initial meeting of Hanks and his Drill Sergeant. I mention these
because they don't typify the piled-on heavy sentiment that the rest of the
movie employs.
