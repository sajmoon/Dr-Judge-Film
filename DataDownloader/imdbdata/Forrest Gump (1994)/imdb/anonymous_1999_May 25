1999_May 25 
<br /><br />A movie where I can see why people liked it, but I simply wasn't one of
them.  First of all, Tom Hanks performance deserves praise.  His
performance
was dead on and wonderful.  The supporting actors deserve praise as well (
especially Gary Sinise).  The film editing was great as
well.<br /><br />The movie itself did not move me like the Shawshank Redemption did ( both
released in 1994).  The writing in Shawshank was much better ( one award
of
the six Gump won).<br /><br />The story of a simpleton floating through life doesn't appeal to me.
There seemed to be no forward drive, and Robert Zemeckis seemed to want to
create a surreal world ( where people are hurt, but not too badly) and
ground it solidly in realism, which just doesn't work.<br /><br />I thought it deserved Best Actor, Supporting Actor, and Film Editing.
The
other three should have gone to other films
