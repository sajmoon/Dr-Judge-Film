I found Forrest Gump to be a really great movie.It kept my attention
most of the time, and overall had a perfect and touching script.The
acting was of course great, and the directing was good as well.I did
find some material a little unlikable, and at some points it may have
got just a bit predictable, but overall it was a surprisingly great
movie that deserves it&#39;s spot in the Top 250.If you haven&#39;t seen this
film you&#39;re definitely missing out on something very special.It was
even somewhat breathtaking, the whole concept I mean, to think that he
could go through life like that, and still be as uptight and optimistic
as he was.Tom Hanks was a brilliant actor in this film, as well as the
supporting characters.This is an excellent movie about life through the
eyes of a disabled, that I feel everyone needs to watch.
