You either like this film or you hate it. There is something for
everybody.
It gives a good review of the major events in history during Forrest's
time.
It is a classic love story between Gump and his girl Jenny. It also shows
that there can be happy endings even in difficult times.<br /><br />I was more interested in Jenny's journey through the film but Tom Hank's
performance deserved the Oscar he got. Robin Wright's performance, as
Jenny,
is just as good and blew me away.<br /><br />I challenge anybody not to be affected by the last 30 minutes.
