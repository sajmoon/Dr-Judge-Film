Why do people love this movie?  This movie is not only completely
unrealistic, it's also boring.  Almost everyone I know who saw this movie
and wasn't middle aged said they liked the movie but it was too long and
kind of or too boring.  Does that make sense?  When looking back at this
movie, did it really give you anything back?  This movie is illogical,
stupid, pointless, and umm... like before I get too redundant, annoying.  I
was hoping that Forrest Gump would die in the war or like get hit by a car
when he was running.  That would have been hilarious and then this movie
could have been up there with Toxic Avenger and Braindead.  And the Academy
Awards are a joke.  They don't recognize really good movies usually, and I'm
stil in shock that American Beauty won since it actually deserved an Oscar. 
I seriously think that Demolition Man or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was a
better movie.  At least Wesley Snipes had a cool hairstyle.  Go rent a
classic like Vanilla Ice's Cool as Ice or C.H.U.D...  Forrest Gump sucks and
isn't he more like an anti hero?  I'd rather have Leatherface or the Toxic
Avenger, but who doesn't root for them anyway?
