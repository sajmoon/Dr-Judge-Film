Many of you have heard of this movie.Many of you have seen this movie.
Forrest gump directed by Robert Zemeckis is a classic.Winner of 6 Oscar
awards including best picture,actor and director this movie takes you
to a dream.<br /><br />I have been big fan of Tom Hanks.I was eager of watching this movie
previously too but never got the chance.My friends who have seen it
before called it classic some called it slow.But yesterday finally i
watched it.<br /><br />Forrest Gump (Hanks), named after a civil war hero, grows up in
Greenbow, Alabama, where his mother (Sally Field) runs a boarding
house. Although Forrest is a little &quot;slow&quot; (his IQ is 75, 5 below the
state&#39;s definition of &quot;normal&quot;), his mental impairment doesn&#39;t seem to
bother him, his mother, or his best (and only) friend, Jenny Curran
(played as an adult by Robin Wright). In fact, the naivete that comes
through a limited understanding of the world around him gives Forrest a
uniquely positive perspective of life.<br /><br />During the next thirty years, Forrest becomes a star football player, a
war hero, a successful businessman, and something of a pop icon.
Through it all, however, there is one defining element in his life: his
love for Jenny. She is never far from his thoughts, no matter what he&#39;s
doing or where he is.<br /><br />Forrest gump is a masterpiece.A noble and beautiful story which touches
your heart.We hardly find any movies in Hollywood which being slow and
without special effects becomes blockbuster.Forrest Gump is among one
of those rare gems.<br /><br />There are movies and movies but only sometimes you find a movie which
stays in your heart and becomes one of your all time favourites.I have
to search for words how to describe such a magical movie.<br /><br />And finally Forrest Gump would have never been a forrest gump without
Tom Hanks.Playing the character of Forrest Gump he is incredible.His
performance was just out of the world.One of the best performances
given by any actor ever.I cant found out words to describe how great
his performance was.Just look at his expressions in the scene in end
when he says&#39;I miss you Jenny..If there is anything you need i wont be
far away&#39;.Totally unforgottable.Even stone hearted people would melt.<br /><br />I gave this review here cause i wanted all members to know how
beautiful and magical forrest gump is.A must watch for everyone
...........A timeless classic
