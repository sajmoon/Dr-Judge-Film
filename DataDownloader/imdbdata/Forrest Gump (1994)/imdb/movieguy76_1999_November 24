1999_November 24 

The film is not a great as many people would have us believe.  The film is
in fact just an excuse to absolve the entire baby boomer generation.  I
also
think that the film teaches us to never defy authority.  Think about
Forrest
never questions and he succeeds as a result.  The film is at best an over
glorified retard film.  It is merely a decent film that attempts
greatness.
Its enormous popularity is another example of the people being doped into
a
waste of time.  The film is a technical masterpiece and I think it
deserves
some credit.  I can appreciate the packaging but not what is inside.<br /><br />
