2009_July 3 
The fact that a movie of this caliber is given such an overall high
rating reflects the disintegrating state of our civilization. Tom
Hanks, as always, is obnoxious and unlikeable. How this guy garners
such critical acclaim is totally baffling. It&#x27;s almost like he didn&#x27;t
cut his acting teeth on the immortal &#x22;Bosom Buddies.&#x22; Oh, wait, he has
become a brash public believer in the impossible Oswald-acted-alone
fairy tale. That always helps careers....<br /><br />To anyone that has a loved one with development difficulties, or has
worked with handicapped people, Forest Gump is a pathetic and
unrealistic caricature. Hanks&#x27;s voice for the character is grating and
unlike any I&#x27;ve ever heard, in the south or from any developmentally
delayed individual. What kind of ridiculous accent is that? Even Rosie
O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s laughable performance as a mentally challenged person was
more believable than Hanks.<br /><br />The plot is beyond preposterous. All those famous people, all the
crucial events of the times (at least by Hollywood historical
standards), and this one very challenged guy just happens to be in the
right place at the right time, over and over again. I love fantasy and
far fletched plots, but this is not remotely possible under any
circumstances.<br /><br />Again, those with personal life experiences in this area, know all too
well just how horribly the handicapped and developmentally delayed are
treated by all too many &#x22;good&#x22; and &#x22;upright&#x22; citizens. Gump seemed to
avoid most of that, when he wasn&#x27;t altering history. This film makes a
mockery of those whose real disabilities make every day a real
challenge. It&#x27;s typical Hollywood, but even worse than usual. Maybe
with another actor in the lead, who could give even a somewhat
acceptable performance, this film might have been better.
