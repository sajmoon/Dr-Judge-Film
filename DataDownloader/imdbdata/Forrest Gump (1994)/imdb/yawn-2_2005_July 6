Way, way too many people think this is the greatest movie ever made.
They clearly haven&#39;t seen enough movies and their idea of a great book
must be something like &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie.&quot; <br /><br />Americans do tend to be a sentimental lot, fond of oversimplification
and easy answers. Still, my China-born wife, daughter of a party member
who didn&#39;t know ANY of the cultural or historical references when she
first saw it, thinks it&#39;s the best American movie she&#39;s seen. So there
is something universal and powerfully emotional here.<br /><br />More than anything else, this is a work of superior craftsmanship that
seems to inspire many people to read far too much into it. This is not
a profound film, but it is a very well-made, highly entertaining one.<br /><br />So many others have mentioned &quot;Being There&quot; as the smarter, meaner
version of &quot;Gump&quot; that I&#39;d like to add my voice to that chorus. It is a
travesty that &quot;Being There&quot; is now largely forgotten. If you admire the
structure of &quot;Gump&quot; make sure you get around to renting it. Hell, if
you hate &quot;Gump&quot; get around to renting it.
