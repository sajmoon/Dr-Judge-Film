Forrest Gump Is a great film, It&#39;s a film of many Genre&#39;s,
Action,Drama,Comedy and Romance. It&#39;s the story of someone called
Forrest Gump, whom is waiting for a bus to see his wife. How ever, he
talks to various people also waiting for their bus about his life; a
sort of &#39;Autobiography&#39;. It&#39;s cleverly put together with scenes of
Forrest and Kennedy, John Lennon and President Nixon. There are also
famous things happening like the Watergate scandal, Man on the moon and
the Kennedy assassination. It&#39;s a great film, and Tom Hanks (Toy Story
and &#39;You&#39;ve got mail&#39;) plays Forrest amazingly. No wonder it got
Oscars. It&#39;s a must see.
