The bus stop. John Savage gets in and goes to Milos Forman&#39;s New York
in his equally breathtaking HAIR. <br /><br />With the farewell quote above (from his papa) which gives live to
Forrest. Forrest Gump gets on the bus to go to school and way, WAY
beyond. But of course, Forrest comes back, keeps on coming back. To us.
He is not stupid, oh no, since he doesn&#39;t do a single act of stupidness
all through the film. He is .. Forrest, or for that matter ...
Perceval. <br /><br />&quot;What do you want to be when you grow up Forrest ?&quot;<br /><br />-&quot;Aren&#39;t I going to be me ?&quot; <br /><br />Even without the amazing special effects (did the money went dry to
have some proper rain effects outside Vietnam ?) which are truly
incredible and good and opened up a new chapter in film-history
(without this film the dead actor Oliver Reed could never have finished
his role in Gladiator...), this epic is wonderful. Of course, when you
get this film on DVD and run it for about 5 or 6 times Straight, you&#39;ll
find ONE tiny flaw in the accent of incredible Tom Hanks. <br /><br />Sure beforehand you wouldn&#39;t have noticed because of the moisture
blocking sinuses and ears and hanging in y&#39; eye-lashes.... 6 golden
statues this film has won. Let&#39;s somehow give writer Winston Groom, who
gave us this round the world trip back to Yoknapatawpha County his
weight in gold.
