Even this movie is old by any standard i have seen it for the first time
only today. And when i logged in to see user comments i wasn't surprised to
see divided user opinions. This movie can be interpreted differently and
provoking in general. Forest Gump by Robert Zemeckis can be movie about
anything you want. It can be movie about American History at galnce,
Vietnam
or about not too bright guy named Forrest Gump who gets lucky. He survives
in
Vietnam, make a few millions, etc... although i was surprised that amongst
nearly 100 comments i have read. I havent' seen anyone who would define a
film storyline as a lovestory, not as american history at glance with
offensive characters painted by stupid Forrest Gump and his black best
friend, who is not so bright too and speak about his shrimp business all
the
time. A love story of two strong personalities, who live their life through
their mistakes to surrender to what was set long time ago.
