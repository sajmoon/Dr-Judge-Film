I lived in China and in 1995 when I was still a high school student, I
watched this movie for its reputation &#150; won several Oscar. Honestly I
felt bored when I was watching the movie that time because I could
hardly understand the meaning of the movie and could hardly feel its
beauty. At that time, only &quot;The Terminator&quot; kind of movies was able to
attract me. After I watched it for the second time now after 11 years,
I felt quite moved by almost all the elements this movie carries, the
story, quotes, special effect, Tom Hank&#39;s perfect portray of Forrest
Gump and most importantly, Forrest&#39;s deepest innate world. It&#39;s not
easy to conclude what kind of person Gump is and what are the meanings
and inspiration this fictitious character conveys to all the viewers.
But I do have the strongest inspiration from this movie, that is,
people can really get somewhere to achieve something not only because
they have a lot of good qualities, more importantly, from what we see
on Forrest Gump, because of not having a lot of bad qualities, or
innate weakness of human beings, or various interferences around
everybody. You can see all those bad qualities, weaknesses and
interferences from the lives of Lt. Dan and Jenny who are normal or
seemingly smart persons. On the contrary, Forrest is a person with low
IQ and was thought of by many people as moron. Yes, Forrest is not
smart and he knows it quite well. But for me, exactly because of his
being not so smart, he doesn&#39;t have those bad things that other normal
persons have that prevent them from achieving what Forrest was able to
achieve. Those people have too many thoughts sometimes, or too much
expectation, or too much depression in face of setbacks and all those
things are actually interferences to the normal people that prevent
them from staying focused for a long time. Now I should be looking at
myself and asking myself, what kind of interferences I should remove
from myself to really get somewhere. Thanks, Forrest Gump, thanks, this
fabulous movie that sheds so much light on me.
