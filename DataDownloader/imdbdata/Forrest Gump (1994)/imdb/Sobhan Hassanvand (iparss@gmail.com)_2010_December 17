For me the film is a promoter of American culture and values and I want
to look at the film from this point of view. It is the promoter of the
American values using both conservative and liberal values, but the
conservative values are more dominant and highlighted and liberal
values are loosely used to promote just the American culture and at the
end liberal values are defeated by conservative values although both
ideologies are used to promote the American culture. The film also uses
the American icon and figure to promote the American culture.<br /><br />Family is and home are very important in film, Forrest mother is a
devoted mother who does her best to keep the family and nurture her
child although Forrest father is not present and may leave the family
but the mother asserts that that he is on vacation so she wants to that
they are a family. &#x22;there is no place like home&#x22; and &#x22;family forever&#x22;
these themes can be seen in the film when Forrest, Jenny and their
child return their home, Greenbow, Alabama, as a family. Gump is the
man family, he is loyal to his love and does his best to have his own
family. Gump is a hard working guy who works and tries hard to achieve
happiness he expects nothing without hard-working. From the beginning
Gump is running and he even runs across the US, symbolically &#x22;chasing
the American Dream&#x22;. Gump also is religious person, after returning
home from China he says that people in China do not go to the church or
he goes to the church to pray in order to have a big shrimping. Forrest
also uses liberal gestures, like participating in anti-Vietnam War
rally and taking part in a TV show to talk about his experience in
China, telling that Chinese people are deprived from freedom and basic
human rights. Gump is the symbol of conservative values and Jenny is
the symbol of liberal values but at the end Jenny is dead but Gump as
the symbol of the conservatives is the source of maintenance and
continuity of the American culture.<br /><br />Totally the film was made to appeal to conservatives and invalidate
liberals but to promote the American culture even by utilizing liberal
values. It also is a condemnation of the counterculture movement of the
1960s and its aftermaths. Jennifer Hyland Wang, movie critic, argued
that Curran&#x27;s death to an unnamed virus &#x22;...symbolizes the death of
liberal America and the death of the protests that defined a decade
[1960s].&#x22; Even the main structure of the film crew connote the
conservative orientation of the film. Steve Tisch, one of the producers
of the film is a conservative person who has produced other
conservative film after Forrest Gump like Knowing and The Pursuit of
Happiness that the later one alongside Forrest Gump are among the best
25 conservative movies by the National Review magazine.
