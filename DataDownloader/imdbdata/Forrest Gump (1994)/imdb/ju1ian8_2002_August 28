If you have not had the opportunity to watch Forrest Gump at least twice I
recommend that you take the time to do so.  The first time you watch the
film it is easy to like the film just based on Tom Hank's excellent
performance and some of the amazing special effects.  It wasn't until the
second time I watched the picture that I started to notice the detail that
the writer put into foreshadowing and symbolism.  Without giving away any
crucial elements in the picture I will simply write...pay close attention
to
his shoes in the picture and everything they ever say about feet.  Pay even
closer attention to Forrest's first conversation with Lt. Dan.  It
foreshadows their entire relationship.  I gave the movie a 9 out of 10 for
it's beautiful glimpse into one man's life and it's philosophical view on
how everyone's &quot;life is like a box of chocolates&quot;.
