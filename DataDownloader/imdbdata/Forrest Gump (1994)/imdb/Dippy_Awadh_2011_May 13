It took me a long time to get around to watching this movie and I&#x27;m
sorry I did. I guess I just didn&#x27;t get it. Everything Forest did was so
unrealistic. <br /><br />People can&#x27;t run like that any long distance runner knows it would be
certain death to try. His character motivations for everything he did
were shallow. The character was too unrealistic. <br /><br />I didn&#x27;t really find anything to be touching or emotional, it all felt
hollow to me. It is beyond me why this movie won any awards at all. In
all fairness it wasn&#x27;t bad, it just wasn&#x27;t good either.<br /><br />Would not recommend this movie at all. A local theatre group could have
done a better job with filming and the acting was horrible!
