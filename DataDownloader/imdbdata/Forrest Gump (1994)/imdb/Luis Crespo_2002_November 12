I've seen this movie at least 4 or 5 times. I see at least once a year
and
try to figure out what's missing. The answer is always: nothing. And
everything.
This movie is over hyped, overproduced, and overacted. My friends who
liked
the movie say I missed the entire point. I don't think
so.
It starts with some shocking vulgar scenes of Forrest's youth such as
his
mother sleeping with the school's principal in order for her son to be
accepted at a `normal school' and other kids bullying him around because
he
can't walk -or act- normally.
Throughout the movie we see Forrest succeeding at everything he tries,
not because he really tries, but because things seem to fall from the sky
right in his hands. Example: he becomes wealthy after investing in an
`apple
company' which was in fact Apple computers. Oh, oh the irony. Plus to
most
viewers annoyance (yes even the ones who think the movie is a classic) he
keeps faithful to his girlfriend Jenny, a personification of the
decadence
of 60's America, even after she dumps him badly a couple of times.<br /><br />He have taught Elvis to dance, he was a hero in Nam, he met President
Kennedy, John Lennon, he unveiled the Watergate Scandal, he played
ping-pong
in communist China.question is.what didn't he do? The message seems to
be:
&quot;No matter how hard you try, there'll be some idiot better than you at
everything&quot;. Topped with some cheap tavern philosophy (life is like a box
of
chocolates) this movie is a butt aching doodle. Avoid it at all cost.<br /><br />
