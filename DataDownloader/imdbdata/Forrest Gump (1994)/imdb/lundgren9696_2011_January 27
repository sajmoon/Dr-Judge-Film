To say that this is a bit of a masterpiece is the right thing to say.<br /><br />Start of with to say that &#x22;Forrest Gump&#x22; is one of my 10 favorite
movies ever made, mostly because the film gives you a fantastic
experience not out of the usual.<br /><br />Robert Zeckemis is a director with a big and nice heart and with he
help this movie is getting to a big and good level.<br /><br />Tom Hanks are amazing, in the film he really knows how to play a role
nice and effect, so i can say that he makes his best role her, Right
here on his little bench, and eats chocolate, Mr. Gary Sinise makes his
preforming good.<br /><br />Good Movie, Perfect Movie
