As you have seen 'Forrest Gump' (1994), you feel
great. &quot; Hey, maybe it's good that everyone are
not very wise&quot;, you hear yourself saying.
And this movie, 'Forrest Gump', gives you every
reason to be happy if you are not as smart as
others. At least he did it well!
Tom Hanks, like usually, is amazing. He gives
Forrest Gump the face no one will ever forget and
a soul so nice and loving. His accent is believable
and he certainly deserved an Oscar!
I'll give it 8 / 10.
