I still remember the first time I watched this movie and I have now
seen it 10 times. I can even watch it tomorrow again. Why? Because it
is one of the only movies I know that presents life in its most basic,
positive form: about love, persistence, commitment and integrity.<br /><br />Forrest is a simple but very honest and loving individual. The
strengths of his character are so numerous that I can only hope that my
son will end up with half of them. I like the way he continues to love
Jenny despite her character flaws; how he stands by his friend Bubba
and follows their joint dream even though Bubba cannot; and always sees
the good in every event of his life.<br /><br />This is one of those movies that indeed brings a lump to your throat
and a tear to your eye (more than once for both) but it is also a movie
that says: &quot;Yes an honest, persistent yet humble life is great&quot;.
