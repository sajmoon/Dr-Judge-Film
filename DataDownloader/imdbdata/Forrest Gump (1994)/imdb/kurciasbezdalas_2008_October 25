I don&#39;t know anybody who didn&#39;t like this film. If you haven&#39;t seen
this film yet, then you must do it. There is everything in this movie.
It&#39;s about a guy with a low IQ who will soon become a football
champion, war hero, ping-pong champion and a millionaire. He&#39;s also
changing other peoples lives so this movie isn&#39;t about one man&#39;s life,
it&#39;s about many different peoples lives. Forest also meets many
celebrities like Elvis Presley or John Lennon. There is some sad
moments and there is some funny moments. The soundtrack was great. It&#39;s
one of the best movies ever made. It&#39;s also the best Tom Hank&#39;s
performance ever. I&#39;ve seen his other movies like Green Mile or
Philadelphia but this one is the best.
