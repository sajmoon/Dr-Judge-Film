And they said this is a typical American film so it&#39;s appealing to
every American,even worse,some say this is a pointless trash...<br /><br />First of all,this film had achieved what a movie ought to achieve,to
change one&#39;s personality in a decent way(Of course not including
simpleton,moron,imbecile),and it had done to me,i learnt from this film
that honesty is a uncertain treasure,we all should gain the certain
side of this treasure thing,and this had never occur to Forrest because
he is so honest enough for voter here to depict it as&quot;innocence is the
key to happiness&quot;,well,i can scarcely accept this haughty
sentence,cause i firmly believe this is not the message the director or
any individual in it want us to get,and if you got it,you are a perfect
moron.<br /><br />As for the acting some say it is pathetic and insufferable to watch
even through 5 mins,and the movie was all down hell from the first 10
mins.Not to mention any award to this film is suspicious for some of
the hater against this film.But i am not presume to throw any of my
personal opinion on this because someone just couldn&#39;t resist watching
a stupid face throughout 2 hours.All i can say is that Forrest Gump
maybe stupid,but it&#39;s still a rather complicated role to portray of,and
i haven&#39;t compare Tom Hanks acting with any other Oscar nominee that
very year,so my choice may not be accurate,and if being such case,i
shall shut up at once.<br /><br />10 out of 10
