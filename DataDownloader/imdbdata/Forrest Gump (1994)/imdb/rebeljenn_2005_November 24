While 'Forrest Gump' is a good movie, it is a victim of being an
over-rated movie. It was one of those films that was in the public eye
for a few years, and people quoted it until it became less than a
novelty. Finally, it died down, and it is nearly forgotten by the
fickle mainstream now.<br /><br />The film follows a southern United States boy with a below-average IQ
into adulthood. It is a film about love and longing as much as it is a
comedy film and a historical film. (I know that there are a few rated
scenes, but this would be a good film to show to young adults because
it is as entertaining as it is a lesson in American history.) Forrest
happens to be involved in some important events from his childhood in
the 1950s (where he meets and inspires Elvis) to the end of
segregation, the Vietnam war, and meeting the president. Despite his
low IQ, luck plays a big part in Forrest's life except in his love life
where he yearns for Jenny, a girl he knew since his childhood.<br /><br />I would recommend this film, even though it is over-rated.
