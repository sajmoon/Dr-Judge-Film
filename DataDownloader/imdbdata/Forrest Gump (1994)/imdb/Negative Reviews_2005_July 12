Give me a break, this is nothing special. The only reason this movie
has the kind of reputation is does is because of the proved fact that
it is impossible for someone to play a leading role in which a
character is mentally handicapped and *NOT get a nomination, let alone
have the movie received well. Think about that for a second and you&#39;ll
see that&#39;s true. There are no movies that weren&#39;t received well where
an actor played a *main character with a *mental handicap. (keep in
mind the asterisked words, that&#39;s what qualifies my statement)<br /><br />There are movies like this I do like, this is simply not one of them.
This was boring because the film had no direction, it simply feels like
you&#39;re watching the biography of a person from some historical text
played out on the big screen. It&#39;s just one episode after the next
depicting the heroic acts of Forrest and showing the relationships
between him and the people he meets, but all these events don&#39;t build
into any storyline you can care about. Each individual episode presents
its own challenges to Forrest, but these feel isolated and doesn&#39;t
build to any kind of payoff.<br /><br />If you like stories like this, go watch Sling Blade, it&#39;s a much better
movie that doesn&#39;t put on a facade of being some grand spectacle of our
time.
