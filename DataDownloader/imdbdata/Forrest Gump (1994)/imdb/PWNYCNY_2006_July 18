This movie is special, and for one reason: Gary Sinise. Mr. Sinise&#39;s
performance as Lt. Dan is one of the great performances in U. S.
cinematic history. His poignant and powerful portrayal of a human being
wallowing helplessly in the deepest recesses of despair is uncanny. Lt.
Dan is the personification of suffering, of emotional desolation, of a
man who is bent on self-destruction but deep down still wants to
survive, still harboring a glimmer of hope that things may turn his
way, that he may attain salvation and a measure of happiness in a life
that has been ravaged by war. Because of Gary Sinise, Forrest Gump is a
great movie.
