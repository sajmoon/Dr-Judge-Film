This movie has several elements for success in the right place, and could
have been a true classic.  Ultimately, however, it is undermined by its
own
thinly-veiled moralizing and its whitewashing of social institutions and
history.  This confection has an inviting, sugary coating of the sweetness
of love and the matters of the heart, but has at its center the preaching
of
the &quot;moral value&quot; of social conformity.
