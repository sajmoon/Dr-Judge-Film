The movie is beautiful. There are many messages in it. The main idea
I&#x27;ve got is - turn yourself on and keep on going whatever you&#x27;re doing.
Once you&#x27;ve decided what you want to do, just do it! Don&#x27;t stop to ask
yourself questions such as: &#x22;is it worth it?&#x22; in moments of despair.
Another message - be simple. A simple man achieved a lot knowing only
just a few basic things his mother taught him. This movie is about
action. There are many things to say, but it is better to watch it.
Maybe I&#x27;ll read the book one day. It is a story of a gifted man, who
got in favorable circumstances and kept on developing his skills. This
is a powerful movie and should definitely be in the top 10 of all
times.
