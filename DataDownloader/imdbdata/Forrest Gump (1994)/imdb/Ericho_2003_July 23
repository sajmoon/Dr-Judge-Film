I think that TV Guide (wasn't it?) summed the movie up very well, when they
said this movie was about the adventures of an ordinary man. The film was
kind of an homage to what can just plain happen to anyone. Who could ever be
entertained (or forget for that matter) the wily accent Forrest Gump had in
this movie? This was released in 1994. That was a very good movie year. This
and &quot;The Mask&quot; (another favorite of mine) came out. They slowly showed how
Gump was expriencing the important elements and occurings of the 20th
century. I once went to a restaruant that was completely devoted to Forrest
Gump. I think it was called &quot;Bubba's Grill&quot; or something like that, and they
showed all the things featured in the movie. Like all those drink bottles
that Forrest drank that caused him to say &quot;I got to pee&quot; to president
Kennedy. You could never forget the various &quot;words of wisdom&quot; in that movie
(&quot;What's vacation?&quot; &quot;It's when you go to a place and you don't ever come
back&quot; &quot;My mother always says, stupid is as stupid does&quot;) Another favorite
part was the subplot with Lieut. Dan. With he lost his legs and years later,
you see him a better man with metal legs. <br /><br />This was based on a book. A writing teacher of mine, Mrs. Olmar said FG was
the only movie based on a book that was better than the book. She said in
the book, Forrest went into space with a monkey and a woman(!). The floating
feather effect was nice too. Tom Hanks is another favorite actor of mine,
with his roles in movies like FG and &quot;Toy Story&quot;. Anyway, I'll give it a
9/10. Really nice movie. <br /><br />Forrest Gump: (talking about president Kennedy) Then they shot him, and a
few years later, they shot his brother.
