Absolutely awful concatenation of lachrymose sentimentality and right-wing
politics.  I hated this movie with an intensity that cannot be measured.
This was one of the most inward looking American movies to be seen in a
long
time.  Americans seem to believe that there is no other country outside
&quot;Godzone&quot;
