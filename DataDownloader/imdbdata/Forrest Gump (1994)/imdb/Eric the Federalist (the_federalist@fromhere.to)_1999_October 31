1999_October 31 

I've been wondering a thousand time if this movie is better than Gandhi
(1982). If so, it's the best movie I've ever seen! Anyway; while Gandhi is
a
movie you can learn a lot of &amp; probably become a better human being,
Forrest
Gump is simply a great experience! I was crying the last half part of the
movie the first time I saw it &amp; also the three times I've seen it since
then
I couldn't avoid crying! I think I'll never stop crying even if I'm seeing
it the 100. time! Tom Hanks became my favourite actor after this movie. I
hope the first present I'll give my child (when I get one) is a copy of
this
marvellous movie! I'm not a fan of American politic, neither American
culture, but this movie is genius! I've made my own homepage about this
film
- you'll find it at
