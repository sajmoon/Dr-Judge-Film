&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; has been a great success in 1994. Beyond the various accuses
of being only a tearjeker of success, we have to say that this movie has a
lot of good things: the story of the stupid famous has a lot of funny
moments (the meeting with Johnson or the saving of Dan in Vietnam), but we
don't have to forget that death is always present in the movie: on Tv we see
only violence and a lot of characters around Forrest die. &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is
a fable of this century, a very beautiful and moving fable. The actors are
great: Tom Hanks gives a very tender performance, made by innocence and
surprise, Robin Wright is the lost angel full of sadness, Gary Sinise shows
us all the rage and self-destruction of his character and Sally Field is the
Mum we all wish to have. Great work behind the scenes with the beautiful
score by Alan Silvestri and the great photography of Don Burgess. Special
effects are exceptional. Look for the young son of Forrest. he's the new
star Haley Joel Osment!
