I was drawn here, because this awful movie is on TV as I write.<br /><br />I&#x27;ll keep the griping to a minimum, but I hated just about everything
this movie dished up.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t hate it quite as much as Independence Day, but it is a very
close second, for very many the same reasons.<br /><br />When making fois gras, the farmer holds the goose&#x27;s neck and rams a
funnel into its beak. Then the farmer pours corn into the funnel, force
feeding the goose, very much like many American movies are made and
presented today.<br /><br />And the viewers sit there beaks agape !!!
