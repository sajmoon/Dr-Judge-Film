Forrest (TOM HANKS)was unlucky when he was child...weak legs,weak
mind,weak social life...when his father was not with him and every body
use to ignore him....he then got his legs strong and proved the world
that he can achieve as much as anyone can-----but the world still call
him stupid and use to ignore him because of his simplicity and naive
behavior. The love of Forrest,his struggle in life will make you cry,I
bet...<br /><br />THe pace of the movie is marvel and the performances are great
specially TOM HANKS..he has played this role so beautifully that you
use to think &quot;THAT GUY HAS SUPERNATURAL TALENT OF ACTING&quot;.... In last I
must say...If you haven&#39;t watch this movie...you are missing one real
pleasure of life.
