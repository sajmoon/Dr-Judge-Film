OK the Simple Facts about Forrest Gump are that it is by far, in my
opinion, the best film I&#39;ve ever had the pleasure to watch. Definitely
Tom Hanks at his best, from the first line through to the last line its
an exciting adventure with unexpected twists. It can entertain all ages
of viewers. Fitting in with past events (e.g. the Veitnam War, JFK etc)
it makes the story so much more believable. The music, the settings,
the director, the actors and the actresses all combined make it a great
film. Definitely worth all the Academy awards it won. I will continue
to recommend this films to friends and family and continue to watch it
as well.
