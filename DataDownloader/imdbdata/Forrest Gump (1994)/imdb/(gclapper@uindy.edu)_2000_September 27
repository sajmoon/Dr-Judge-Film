I want to make two observations that I have not seen in the over 160
reviews
of this film that I just read on this site.<br /><br />1)  One thing that Forrest does not embody, something which our culture is
drowning in, is sarcasm.  (For accessible examples, read many of the
reviews
for this film!)  That is one of the reasons people find it surprisingly
moving.  If you watch a lot of popular movies, not to mention sitcom TV,
you
might think that sarcasm is the natural idiom of communication.  But then,
when someone actually asserts something and takes a stand for something
(other than self-seeking sex or egotistical domination) without a whiff of
sarcasm, the effect can be stunning.<br /><br />We have forgotten that sarcasm is parasitic on somebody actually asserting
something.  To cut through the garbage of life we should be able to
distance
ourselves from the false parts of it, and that is what sarcasm does.  But
sarcasm cannot assert anything except its derision of someone else's
assertion.  It is derivative and parasitic.  To see someone who is without
sarcasm, as we see in Gump, can be an eye-opening and truly moving
experience, opening us to a vision of life where there is something to
believe in, and not just something to mock.<br /><br />This is not a question of Gump's (low) intelligence, though our culture
often likes to think that sarcasm is the sine qua non of intelligence.  It
is about a desire to commit and risk.  Sarcasm falls silent in the face of
life honestly lived in adherence to values worth striving after.  Hence,
all
we are left with are tears when we see someone without sarcasm and guile
who
lives a life of loyalty and love.<br /><br />2) The recitation of recent history may seem a frivolous excuse for a few
jokes, but the whole point of it detonates in the penultimate scene where
Forrest talks to Jenny's grave.  He asks &quot;Is it Lieutenant Dan who is
right,
or is it Momma?&quot; (or words to that effect).  He is asking if we are all
fated in a predeterministic way or if we are truly free to make our own
destiny.  His answer--&quot;I think its both&quot;--rings true for many people, and
hence is a powerful comment on all of life.  Both the capriciousness of
history and a sense of something coming from it are acknowledged, and that
speaks to me.<br /><br />The feather seems to be blown around randomly, but it comes to rest in
strategic places.  God's grace works within the context of our human
freedom, and, in the end, this is a film about grace.
