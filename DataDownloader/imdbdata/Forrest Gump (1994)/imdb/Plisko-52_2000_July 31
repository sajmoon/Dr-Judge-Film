  Six years have passed since we first saw Forrest Gump. At first is was
highly praised and has since slowly died off. I believe that ten years from
now, Forrest Gump will be regarded as an American classic.<br /><br />  The last time I watched &quot;Gump&quot; was about three years ago and it was
wearing thin. Having watched it so many times, it began to loose its punch.
You realize that it is VERY fictional and that it is not nearly as good as
1994's Best-Picture runner-up Pulp Fiction. But, having watched it recently
I was able to enjoy it again, more than I did the first time, because of the
great performances by all, and the unforgettable moments.<br /><br />  Forrest Gump is destined to become a classic due to its great,
heart-warming story, and classic lines that will be repeated like those from
Casablanca, Gone With The Wind, and other favorites. The main reason though,
is that Forrest Gump is a lesson in 1900's American history. The sixties
were a crazy-ass time, and I'm glad I didn't have to live in them(I'm only
20). Politicians being assassinated, Vietnam, drugs, and the Cold War all
depicted in their actual footage. Actual broadcasts of Nixon's resignation,
the Apollo landing, and newscasts of politicians such as Ford, Reagan, and
Gov. Gorge Wallace.
  &quot;Gump&quot; is a great movie. One that WILL be appreciated even more through
time.
