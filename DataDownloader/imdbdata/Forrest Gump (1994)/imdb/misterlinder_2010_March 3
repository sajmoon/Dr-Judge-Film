He made a great step forward literally.. First he had his legs wrapped
in iron and later he ran through the hole United States, just because
he wanted to run, just carefree. This person has to be kind of naive or
not? From the little kid that got mobbed to a national personality-
that&#x27;s the story of Forrest, Forrest Gump. Forrest Gump was actually
the first movie that made me cry at the end. One now might think that
it is a really sad story but there&#x27;s also a lot of happiness in there.
All that great things that naive Forrest experiences made me laugh.<br /><br />Although it is a quite long movie I could watch it again and again just
because it&#x27;s also very funny sometimes, it&#x27;s the mix, I think between
sadness and happiness that makes this movie one of the greatest ever.
