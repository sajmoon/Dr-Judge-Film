1998_September 8 

I went to this movie expecting something spectacular. I left the theatre
thinking to myself &quot;what the heck was so special about that?&quot; When it came
out on video I decided to buy it because it was racking up so many awards.
The second time was much better than the first. I forgot about the hype, I
just watched it and enjoyed it with my family. It is a great movie. Funny
at times, yet extremely sad at times also. It makes you think about life,
it makes you want to be like Forrest. Tom Hanks is great, as is Gary Sinise
, Sally Field, and the character Bubba is one of the all-time great
supporting characters. I have seen it at least 10 times now. My rating: 9
out of 10.
