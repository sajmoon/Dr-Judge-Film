I think Forest Gump is an absolute excellent example of acting and
directing skills. The story can sometimes be far fetched, but Tom Hanks
plays the character in amazing fashion, this is by far my favourite
film, its a one in a million film. As a film it holds everything thats
needed, Emotions, romance, war, rights, drugs, and of course.... The
shrimping industry. <br /><br />I don&#39;t think i will ever see a film like this again, and i can watch
Gump over and over again, i literally know it word for word. <br /><br />For all those critics that hate this film, i really don&#39;t think they
know what they are talking about, and perhaps they had trouble
childhood maybe?<br /><br />I normally am a huge horror fan and my DVD case is full of horror
movies so it goes to show how much i rate this film, because its far
form a horror movie.<br /><br />Love the FIlm!
