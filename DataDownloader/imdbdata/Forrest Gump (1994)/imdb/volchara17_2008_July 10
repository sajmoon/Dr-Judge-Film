Excellent film. The History of the simple person, with extraordinary
open and fair soul understands each it on the. This person does not
pursue something in a life, it is internally self-sufficient. One
speak, that such people it is possible to use instead of nails, they
are strong and hardy. And in a life we do not understand them, but film
opens, all the parties of soul Forrest, its external calmness and an
internal pressure, self-criticism. Its absolutely trustful attitude to
people seems an attribute? The fool?, and all can not so? It Can the
world has gone mad, and hurricane has incurred minds of people. Which
now money has put above, than the person? Where, simple human concept?
To trust? - turns to something improbable and naive. It can only a
Utopia, but it is a Utopia for us, it seems to us, what we know all and
consequently behavior Forrest seems to us ridiculous? And can we turn
in Onegin? Both we look down on the world and we do not notice that at
us above a head? After film it would be desirable to be pulled out for
city, and for a while to forget household problems.
