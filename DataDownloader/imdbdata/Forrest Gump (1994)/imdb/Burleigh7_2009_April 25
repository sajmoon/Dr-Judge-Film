Forrest Gump is a film that essentially decides to take a fictional
developmentally delayed Southerner and insert him into several decades
of history, having him interject with everything from George Wallace&#x27;s
anti-integregation push to inspiring Elvis&#x27; famous dance moves. This is
simply a history trivializing gimmick, that is repeated dozens of times
throughout the film. Three things basically happen in the film; Forrest
does something amazing, he interjects in a historical event, but boy
does he miss Jenny. This is constantly repeated as well. The message;
that the wholesome, slow, never questioning Forrest is a hero while the
nonconformist free thinking Jenny becomes an aids infected slut is
problematic. The depiction of Forrest by Tom Hanks is one note and mind
numbingly sentimental. Forrest Gump is not so much a movie as a one
note concept stretched out to a bloated running time. Stupid is as
stupid does, and this movie certainly is stupid.
