when i watched this movie the 2nd time around i found quite a few
hidden details which made the movie all the more enjoyable. like for
example something i noticed was that in the interview in which john
Lennon is also present, as Forrest talks about china, Lennon&#39;s
responses are the lyrics of his song &#39;imagine&#39;. i thought that was
pretty cool. did anybody else notice that? well thats all i wanted to
say, but now have to continue to comply with the guidelines. so how
about talking about my favourite movies and stuff. i love to watch
movies. my favourites are life is beautiful, Forrest gump, snatch and
lock stock and 2 smoking barrels. i just saw he matrix for the 1st time
today and fell in love with it. i am really looking forward to seeing
shawshank redemption and hotel Rwanda.
