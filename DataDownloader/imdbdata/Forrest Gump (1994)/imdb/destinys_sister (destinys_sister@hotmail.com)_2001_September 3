Wow! I really love this film and I cannot understand how people can say it
is bad.It is extremely moving and powerful which is exactly what a film (of
this genre) should be. If you wanna a comedy, go watch a comedy, nobody is
denying that this is not a romantic-comedy full of belly laughs but it is a
real tear jerker and makes you think and Tom Hanks totally deservedly won
an
Oscar for being such an outstanding actor. It is really a fantastic film,
there are not enough ways for me to express that. It makes you think and it
touches you and it is *very* hard for the film crew
(actors,directors,cameraman
etc) to be able to achieve that but they have. I seriously dont understand
how people can be so critical and hate this. I do not (well hardly ever)
watch a movie expecting to critise it, that is not what movies are for. And
*of course* you are not going to like some of the characters because they
are not *meant* to be likeable!! Thats just how some people are, a film
cannot portray everyone as sugary sweet and perfect.
I understand that not everybody will think it is fantastic but I do not
understand the negative comments, to me they seem silly because I think
this
is a wonderful film, one of the best ever. The best thing about this film
is
that it goes through lifes highs and lows realistically,
powerfully,emotionally, it is sweet and honest and it portrays life how it
is.I whole heartedly give it an A++.
