No movie has touched me as much as Forrest Gump. At the end of the
movie you really feel lucky to have seen this movie and would want to
watch over and over again. Tom Hanks produced one of the best acting
skill ever which made him win the Academy-Award which he truly
deserved. If you are a real movie lover then Forrest Gump is the movie
that you&#39;ll never regret watching. It&#39;s one of those movies which
brings a smile on your face even when you are feeling low and lost
hope. The best part is when he is standing on Jenny&#39;s grave and Forrest
speaks his lines. Remember always that you are no different from others
and can achieve what others have. <br /><br />I would give it a 10/10 DO WATCH IT.
