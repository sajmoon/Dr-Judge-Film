Until it was recently shown on TBS, I had forgotten how much I loved
this film. As a history buff and daughter of a Vietnam vet, I
originally watched this film as a 14-year old girl. I loved so many
aspects of the film, and could only being to appreciate the sacrifice
my daddy had made Watching it as an adult brought me to tears.
Regardless of how one may have felt as a viewer, and regardless of the
The complexity of the politic brought to life the many complex emotions
associated with the Vietnam war. No matter what our feelings may be
about our current war, it is about time that the Vietnam vets earn
their just rewards.<br /><br />A wonderful, moving film based on themes, regardless of political
position.
