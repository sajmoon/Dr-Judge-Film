2000_November 3 

I have seen this masterpiece several times, and I can honestly say there is
no other film quite like it. The plot is now familiar to all - Tom Hanks
plays a man with a lower-than-average IQ whose life becomes intertwined with
the major events and people of recent U.S. history.<br /><br />In the film he:
- inspires Elvis how to swivel his hips
- see Governor George Wallace attempt to stop high school
integration
- becomes a phenomenal college football player
- fights in the Vietnam war and rescues several soldiers
- speaks at a huge anti-war rally
- becomes a millionaire philanthropist through shrimp fishing and wise
investments
- witnesses the Watergate break in
- runs across America several times
- meets John Lennon
- creates several well known sayings
- becomes a ping-pong champion and travels to China to
compete
- meets three U.S. presidents<br /><br />What's fascinating is that as amazing as these accomplishments sound, they
really don't mean very much to Gump. His only need is just to be with his
life-long sweetheart Jenny. His pursuit and ultimate winning over of her is
really all that matters to him. It is the execution of this simply story
against the vast events of history that makes this film absolute
magic.<br /><br />Everything about this film works, and works well. The cinematography, the
music, the script, direction, and of course, the acting. The special effects
in this film are also remarkable, but they are used fairly sparingly, and
act more as a supplement to the story, rather than becoming the story
itself, as in many other films. Robert Zemeckis is one of my favorite
directors, and this film will probably be remembered as his magnum
opus.<br /><br />10/10
