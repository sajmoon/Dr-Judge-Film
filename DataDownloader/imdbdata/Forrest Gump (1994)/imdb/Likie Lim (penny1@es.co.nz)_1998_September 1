1998_September 1 

Forrest Gump has probably the most original storyline ever told. Almost
everyone I know has seen it and liked it one way or another. It is well
known for its great biographical work, but it is better known for its story
of the rising and falling period of America. It's like all the Oliver Stone
films rolled into one, with a touch of romance and a humor which pokes fun
at a time when no-one knew what the hell was going on with their country. I
particularly liked the war scenes when it resembled many Vietnam War
classics. But to put one genre summarising Forrest Gump, it has to be
Romance, for the 40 year relationship between Jenny and Forrest has the
most memorable scenes.
