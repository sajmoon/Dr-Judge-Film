Ok I don't really have to praise this much since it's already gotten so many
good reviews but it is such a great movie. Tom Hanks does such a wonderful
job in this movie and it's one of the best movies of all time. It should be
a lot higher then #140 in the top 250 but oh well. The movie has a terrific
story, good actors, and good music, 9/10
