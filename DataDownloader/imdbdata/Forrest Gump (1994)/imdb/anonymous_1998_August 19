Forrest Gump is the greatest movie ever made. I know that many people
would disagree on this assertion, but I believe it to be true.  What makes
the movie so great is the wide range of emotions that you experience while
watching it.  It goes from comedy, to happiness, to suspense to a feeling
of sadness, and then back to happiness again.  This is only a small
statement of this movie, but my thoughts of it are much greater.
