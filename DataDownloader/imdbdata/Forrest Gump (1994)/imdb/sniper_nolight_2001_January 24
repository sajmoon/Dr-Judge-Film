This movie is one of the best movies ever I have it on LD. I'm from Denmark
and still I find this way of portraying parts of the American history very
entertaining. Tom Hanks (of course) and Gary Sinise performs like the great
actors they truly are... the way Tom Hanks does Gump gives me chills with
excitement... Usually I'm pretty sensitive about movies, but with this one I
can't say anything bad at all. Some say that this movie isn't as good as
Pulp and Shawshank.... no.. it's better... and to that I must add that Pulp
is also one of my all-time favorites so I'm not being ignorant... Forrest
Gump just hit my moviespot  I guess:o) ...10 isn't enough for this
movie...
