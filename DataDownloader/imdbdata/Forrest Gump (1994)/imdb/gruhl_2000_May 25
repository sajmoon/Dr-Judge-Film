This has to be one of the most over-rated films of all time. I expected
the
film to be stupid, which it was, but I didn't expect it to be incredibly
boring also. I couldn't even get through the video in one night; I was so
bored I had to stop watching it and finish it the next night. Its winning
the Oscar for Best Picture crystallized the opinion that I had been
forming
for several years that the opinion of the Academy is pretty
meaningless.
