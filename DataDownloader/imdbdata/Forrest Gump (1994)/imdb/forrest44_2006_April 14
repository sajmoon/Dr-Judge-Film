If there should be a movie for you to remember in a lifetime and to
learn everything about life when in confusion or when disappointed by
the surrounding world, it would definitely be Forrest Gump, which
speaks for an optimistic and innocent outlook on life whatever seems
bothering happened around. On the contrary the &quot;clever&quot; people live
every day under pressure or feeling of loneliness, longing for the age
of innocence, singing &quot;yesterday, all my trouble seems so far away...&quot;,
when Forrest says &quot;life is like a box of chocolates, you never know
what you&#39;re gonna get&quot; and steadily moves on,achieving the true meaning
of life. Besides, I was deeply moved by three scenes in this
masterpiece,which I&#39;d like to share. The first is Forrest&#39;s shouting &quot;I
want Bubba!&quot; The second is when Forrest asked his dying mother about
his destiny, and she for the last time said &quot;life is like a box of
chocolates, Forrest, you never know what you&#39;re gonna get.&quot; And the
third, also the most touching scene occurs when AIDS-infected Jenny
said to Forrest: I wish I could have been with you then&quot; and the answer
came from Forrest as &quot;You were.&quot; Most unexpected and powerful. All in
all, Forrest Gump is one of my favourite of all time, and I would
commend it to everybody.
