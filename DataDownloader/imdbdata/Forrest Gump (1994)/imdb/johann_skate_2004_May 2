I'll not get involved into a deep analysis of this motion picture. Other
people can give a better view.
I'll just say that no movie character inspires me more than Forrest, who
with his intelligence as excuse lives like we all wish we could. He is a
completely free human being, in the matter he doesn't have any biases or
stiff beliefs.

I think everyone can learn a lot from this uncomplicated man, who does
what
he believes is right, without turning away from his goal, no matter if it
happens' to involve running across America for three years...<br /><br />
