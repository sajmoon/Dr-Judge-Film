This movie was pleasant to watch although as it progressed towards the
end it became more and more cheesy. Can Forrest Gump be a grotesque
caricature of the average ignorant and politically numb citizen that
sees history passing in front of his eyes without noticing it? Is the
country he lives in made for idiots? I liked the return from Vietnam
and the scenes with the lieutenant. I didn&#39;t like the philosophical
contemplations made by Gump as he becomes &quot;wise&quot; nor the way the movie
concludes with the unnecessary death of Jenny which leaves Forrest
raise his child that in turn doesn&#39;t seem to have any particular
problems with that. The heroics towards the end are also incredibly far
fetched. Overall it is a fun movie with some good moments but I
wouldn&#39;t take it too seriously.
