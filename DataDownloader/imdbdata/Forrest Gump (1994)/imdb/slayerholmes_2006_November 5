Gimme a break. There are a few nicely photographed scenes, especially
in Vietnam-section, but otherwise this is as pathetic, manipulative
tearjerking as it gets. Of course you always succeed when you put a
retard or other ways handicapped or addicted person in the main role
(&quot;Rainman&quot;, &quot;Awakenings&quot;, &quot;Bad Boy Bubby&quot; etc etc) and make him deal
with the &quot;sane&quot; world. Drama unfolds by itself. It&#39;s funny how almost
all the films which are labeled as &quot;family picture&quot; don&#39;t concern male
members aged 15-60. So don&#39;t worry, producers and film companies, there
are always this huge part of mankind to whom you can sell these stories
no matter how transparently &quot;constructed&quot;: women. And senior citizens
who you can of course sell anything to.<br /><br />Like in everything, there are a few exceptions, i.e. movies you can
honestly offer to everyone. &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; coming first in mind.
