I really liked Forrest Gump the first time I watched it and I still do
like
it.<br /><br />But can someone explain to me why it won 6 oscars, including best picture
and best actor, in the same year that The Shawshank Redemption &amp; Pulp
Fiction were released. Forrest Gump is a good movie but it isn't in the
same
league as TSR or PF. Will the academy ever apologise for this mistake and
many others? I think they should.<br /><br />Tom Hanks was good, but the real winner was Morgan Freeman.
Robert Zemeckis did a great job, but what Quentin did.....WOW.
Forrest Gump is a wonderful film, but in this year against Pulp and esp.
Shawshank it shouldn't have won.<br /><br />This (Forrest Gump) is a great indication that the academy awards don't
always get it right, this comes mainly through the hype which surround
some
movies therefore maybe the oscars should  be held a year later when the
hype
is gone. (Titanic vs. L.A. Confidential another example) Then the real
winners will win hopefully.<br /><br />1994 was a great year but the academy got all the main oscars wrong (best
actress was Natalie Portman for Leon), what a shame.<br /><br />Nevertheless my rating for Forrest Gump is 8/10<br /><br />
