&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is a great movie, although some people say it is &quot;the
greatest ever made&quot; and Tom Hanks' performance is &quot;the best ever&quot;, quite the
contrary, though (actually, not THE contrary).<br /><br />Forrest Gump is a quite remarkable film, but unfortunately, its cheesier
than an extra-cheese pizza, and I found that Hanks' performance was a bit
overboard, and the film is a bit silly. <br /><br />&quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; were far better films, that
lost to Forrest Gump. I found that that was quite bad. Sure, Forrest Gump is
good, and fun, but it is nothing compared to Shawshank and Fiction. And
Morgan Freeman, John Travolta, Nigel Hawthorne and others who gave
remarkable performaces, but lost to Hanks' overblown one.<br /><br />Anyway, that's my 2 cents, Forrest Gump's good, but has a lot of errors,
while Shawshank and Fiction were better, and didn't have many
errors.<br /><br />&quot;We blew it&quot; - Easy Rider
