(10 out of 10)  When I was 15, I saw 'Star Wars' on the big screen for the
first time.  I saw it many times that summer, and as a 15 year-old boy, it
had a tremendous influence on me.  No movie came close to supplanting Star
Wars as my all-time favorite movie until 'Forrest Gump.'<br /><br />I saw 'Forrest Gump' on the big-screen six times, and many times on video
since then.  It is the most life-affirming movie I've ever
seen.<br /><br />I don't give 10's to movies very often.  A great movie should get a 9.  The
difference between a 9 and a 10 is feeling.  How does the movie make you
feel after you've seen it?  How long do the images stick with
you?<br /><br />There is not a single scene in 'Forrest Gump' that is without thought and
feeling.  The movie is hilarious and tragic.  It is soulful and charming. 
It is incredibly sad and emotionally uplifting.  A true rollercoaster of
genuine feelings.  Set against the backdrop of the 50's through 80's, it has
that nostalgic and true ring to it.  It has to, since what happens to
Forrest, Forrest Gump, is incredible.<br /><br />The movie is audacious to say the least.  Any other film that puts its
no-name central character with people ranging from Elvis to Nixon will seem
like a copycat of this one.<br /><br />Hanks is absolutely superb.  The previous year he won an Oscar for his most
sincere work, 'Philadelphia'.  He won THIS Oscar for his most seminal work. 
It will probably be the movie he will most be remembered by, even though he
has decades of movies ahead of him.<br /><br />The team that put this together, most notably Robert Zemeckis, did a great
job with everything from characters to celebrity appearances to classic
music setting the mood (listen to &quot;Camelot&quot; playing in the background as
Forrest is in the JFK White House).<br /><br />The weakest parts of the film are Robin Wright Penn, who is a good actress,
but not great, and the running scenes.  But since Robin is not in the film
that much, it's okay.  And the running towards the end actually give a bit
of a breather, I feel, so I'm not bothered by it.<br /><br />With all of the ups and downs in the film, how can I say this is the most
life-affirming movie I've ever seen?  Because at the end of the day, Forrest
Gump is a man who has been to hell and back, who has lost loved ones, who
has struggled with his place in the world, and managed to come through it
all with sweetness and love.  The world changed, and in some ways Forrest
changed with it, but he is not jaded by it, as you and I are.  If we could
be as simple as Forrest, mightn't we be happier?<br /><br />
