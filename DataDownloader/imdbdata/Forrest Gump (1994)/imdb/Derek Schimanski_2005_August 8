Looking for Action? Or how about a little romance? Or maybe you like
sports films? Maybe you like all of these? Well if you like any of
these you are in luck! Forrest Gump, winner of 6 Oscars, including best
picture, and best actor (Tom Hanks!), is a great film that can be
enjoyed by anyone. Forrest Gump, seen on several American historical
occasions (and causing a few of them), is a man of slower wit, but with
a glowing heart, where throughout this entire film he relies on, so he
can get through a large complex world, and care for his loving friend,
Jenny. Along the way earning fame, hope, glory, riches, and deep
hearted caring friends, Forrest Gump sets you up for a masterpiece of
theater that will live out a long name in the film industry for many
years.<br /><br />Although Gump has been getting a name for being Right-Wing biased, it
was not meant to be a political movie, but a movie about following your
heart, and living out destiny, and MUST not be disgraced with a vulgar
thing like politics.
