Forrest Gump is a good movie. Tom Hanks is great in it, and the
storyline was great. But otherwise, it was loose. The story could&#39;ve
flowed more in my opinion and the acting was okay. To me, Forrest Gump
wasn&#39;t anything special, just an okay movie I watched one day when I
was bored. Took up a lot of time. The story, like I said was pretty
good, but I wanted to see more; more accomplishments in this story. Tom
Hanks I thought was an excellent choice for the heroin. Yet, the movie
didn&#39;t catch onto to me, and it didn&#39;t really grab a real kind of
attention from me. And also, how does Forrest Gump beat Shawshank
Redemption in the Oscars? I still can&#39;t understand that.
