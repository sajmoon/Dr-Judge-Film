*~-S P O I L E R-~*<br /><br />A briliant brilliant movie, about a kid, in which his IQ is 75,
making
him different.
and from the beginning of the movie, even before the story begins, you see
thet forrest is the great great grandchild of admiral forrest, the man who
created the KKK's.
And from giving Elvis Presly the unique &quot;leg-shakin'&quot; move, in his video &quot;I
ain't nothing but a hound dog&quot;.
and from there on, he is appearing with great presidents (I don't know how
they did this! these are the real presidents!), and making diffrance, even
if it's the biggest thing, like saving souls in the viatnam war, and
setting
the record of running two years in a row,  or by inventing the &quot;SMILEY&quot; ;)
:) :( or inventing the sticker &quot;S*** happens&quot;, the world will never be the
same once youve seen it through the eyes, of forrest gump...
And the famous saying, that life is like a box of chocolate, is
true.
you can really never guess what comes later, and later.
every thing they say matters.
so, if you'r gonna watch it, watch twice, or three times.
if you can, in a row. it will explain lots'a things.
