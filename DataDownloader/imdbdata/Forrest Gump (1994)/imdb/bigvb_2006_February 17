Maybe the greatest film of the contemporary cinematic age. A heart-felt
tale of love, loss and life. The films meandering account, of a
selfless man, in search of destiny; portrays vivid historical events
and landmarks, affirming an aura of surreal realism. &quot;Adversity does
not create character, it uncovers it&quot;, and this statement is no truer
than for Forrest Gump. As the film suggests, perhaps life IS as fragile
as a feather, moving from place to place for no rhyme or reason. But
maybe, just maybe, there is reason; an underlying human hope, that
there are no coincidences, that there is a plan and you never know
where it may take you. To pass off this film as 'great' or even
'excellent' would be an insult of unfathomable proportions. An insight
into the fragility of life and the unbound nature of 'destiny'; maybe
we're all just feathers, blowing on a cool summer breeze.
