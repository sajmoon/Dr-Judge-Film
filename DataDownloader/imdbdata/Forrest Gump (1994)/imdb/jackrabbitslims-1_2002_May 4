2002_May 4 

What can be said about this film, it was the big one at the time in 1994 and
now 8 years later after much smoke has cleared on this movie, I have sat
down and watched and still I find this movie to be one of the greatest tales
to ever be told. The modern journey of a man on his quest for the woman he
loves. Any actor should analyze Tom Hanks in this film for we see him pull
off a very dramatic role without overdoing it
