This is an old fashioned tear jerker that might not appeal to everyone.
But
its heart is in the right place.  I enjoyed it when I first saw it in the
cinema and I look forward to watching it again, although I can imagine it
might not date very well, especially viewed alongside the high tension,
high
effects and sensationalised movies of today.
