I just REALLY saw this film for the 1st time in my US History Class
(technically my 2nd time, I saw it when it first came out in 1994 and
had no clue what it was about) and I must say it is the greatest movie
I&#39;ve ever seen. Once the viewer has a full understanding of the
historical context of the movie, he/she can appreciate the ingenious
plot of this story, told through the eyes of a simplistic yet at the
same time complex individual. His relationship with Jenny as they part
ways and are then re-united is a love story that is emotionally
touching and moving. Everything about this movie deserves praise. It&#39;s
a shame IMDb only allows for 10/10 ratings.
