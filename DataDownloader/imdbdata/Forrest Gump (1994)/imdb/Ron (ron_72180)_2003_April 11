I was one of those people who had heard all the hype about Forrest Gump and
then saw the movie. This movie is too overrated. Yes Tom Hanks pulls off a
great performance as this character and it is pretty much a great history
lesson, but I dont think it deserved all the awards and acclaim it received.
In all I think only Tom Hanks deserved the award for best actor. We all know
it's very hard to pull off a performance like that. Look at Sean Penn in I
Am Sam....terrible. I wont go into what it's about cause we all know it. I
know there are many out there who feel this was a great movie and I wont
argue with you, you are all entitled to your opinion. To me I thought Pulp
Fiction should have gotten it all that year. It had a lot of things Forrest
Gump didnt. But yes there were things Gump had that Pulp Fiction didn't.
