   Forrest Gump is a wonderfully magical and enduring film of nostalgia
through the eyes of one man who is so beat up inside that he doesn't mind
getting rained on. Almost everyone he has ever met or known ends up with a
fortune of bad luck (Elvis, Lennon, his mom, Bubba, the Kennedys, Wallace,,)
as he further goes on granting good luck on others by creating or
contributing to Elvis's movements, mooning, smiley faces, jogging,
Watergate, Lennon's lyrics and the Chinese peace movement. The altering of
the old footage was so masterfully done and the incorporating of historical
and social events almost convinces you that Forrest Gump was a real person.
There is a message behind this movie that suggests that we only gain
personal fulfillment through  trying to improve the lifestyles of the others
on this planet. This is a movie meant to be watched over and
over.
