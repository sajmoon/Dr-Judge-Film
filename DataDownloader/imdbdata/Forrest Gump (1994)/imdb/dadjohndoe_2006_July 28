I still can&#39;t believe that there were over 2000 votes that gave the
rating &quot;1&quot; to this movie. It&#39;s clear to me that those people don&#39;t have
a clue. Obviously, this movie is simply TOO GOOD for the masses to
understand, but still...i wonder... Doubtlessly, this is one of the
most valuable pieces of art in the history of mankind, hence i do not
expect many people to reckon its true value. But still...i thought that
mediocre people could at least think &quot;yeah, this must be good...i don&#39;t
really understand it, but i have a feeling that it&#39;s good, so i&#39;ll just
give it a 9 so i can be cool (everybody would think that i&#39;m smart and
i understood it)&quot;...but...guess i was wrong. Honestly, i am sorry that
not everybody understands this film...if everybody could, the world
would be a much better place to live now...because there it is...the
meaning of life...right under your ignorant noses...(and the masses
would think: &quot;what a showoff!&quot;...yeah...i know...)
