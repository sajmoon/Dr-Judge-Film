Forrest Gump is one of the best stories of all time. It flows so well
and there are so many clever moments that connect the film. Each
segment of Forrest&#39;s autobiography is packed with emotion and humor.
This movie really has it all. The characters are really amazing. I love
the relationship he forms with Bubba and with lieutenant Dan. This
movie is jam packed with quotes. The epic relationship between Forrest
and Jinny worked really well, it was heart wrenching at points. The
performance by Tom Hanks was amazing they way he changed his voice, his
walk, and his whole persona was really amazing. I love this movie every
time I watch it. From start to finish it is a masterpiece that I think
everyone should watch.
