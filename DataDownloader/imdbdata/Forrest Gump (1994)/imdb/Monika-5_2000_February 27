I still don't understand what all the hype about Forrest Gump is all about.
It's a good film, but REALLY! The cast is all good, with Tom Hanks in fine
form as usual, and Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, and Sally Field are all very
well cast. The best scene in my opinion is where Forrest tells Jenny that he
knows what love is. A good movie but still too much hype.
