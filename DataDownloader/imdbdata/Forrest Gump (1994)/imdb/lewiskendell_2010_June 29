&#x22;Mama always said that dyin&#x27; was a part of life. I sure wish it
wasn&#x27;t.&#x22;<br /><br />No matter what Tom Hanks does for the rest of his career, to me, he&#x27;ll
always be Forrest Gump. I mean that as a compliment. His role here was
one of the best and most memorable that I&#x27;ve ever seen in a movie. I
can&#x27;t imagine another actor who could have played this character, and
played him so well.<br /><br />Forrest&#x27;s story will take you all across America, and beyond. You get
to see a large part of recent American history through his eyes. It&#x27;s
extremely clever the way that Forrest&#x27;s presence is weaved throughout
so many iconic events and places. The man meets Presidents, inspires
kings (of music), and lives the kind of life that most people would
never even dream of. And he takes everyone watching along with him.&#xA0;<br /><br />Forrest Gump is so beloved, because it&#x27;s so charming and heartbreaking
and genuine. Even when it&#x27;s at its most sentimental or sugary sweet,
it&#x27;s grounded in the kind of genuine human emotion that makes great
movie experiences. You&#x27;ll laugh and fight back tears, but you&#x27;ll also
think. This is one of the few movies that everyone should see, and that
almost everyone will like. It&#x27;s a classic in every sense of the word.
