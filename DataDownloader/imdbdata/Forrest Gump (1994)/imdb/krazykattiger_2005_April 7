2005_April 7 
First of all if you don't want to read a review from a 12 year old girl
don't read it.<br /><br />Forrest Gump touched my heart dearly when i first watched it after 8
years. It made me understand about what happened back in the 70's- 90's
and it amazed me. Mostly i loved Forrest, Lt. Dan,and Buba(although
he's was in the movie for a short time). I'll list why i like each of
these characters <br /><br />Forrest: He reminds me of my Mildly Autisic brother and reminds me of
the kids i go to Special ED. with. He is a confused man and he narrates
the story very well. He makes me laugh and cry with some of his stories
of what he dealt in his life.<br /><br />Lt. Dan: He just grew on me when i first saw him and also his lack of
belief in Jesus and i feel it too since i hate going to CCD. Not a very
good reason <br /><br />Buba: When i first saw him on the army bus he made me smile also not a
good reason.<br /><br />Other than that i give this movie 7 out of 10 stars for a great
imaginative movie
