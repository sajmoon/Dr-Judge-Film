This is one of the best movies made. The story, the characters, the
flow, the humor, the wisdom, was just outstanding. All these different
elements of filmmaking worked so organically. It is a film that leaves
you uplifted. It truly deserved all the Oscars it won. <br /><br />Tom Hanks gave a career best performance. Historic events were never
treated the way the have been in this film. You see it from the
perspective of Forrest Gump who doesn&#x27;t realize what is happening, and
just goes with the flow. But for the viewer the contrast of someone
like him in some of America&#x27;s darker events is clear. Without preaching
it is a comment on what America is. But what rises above everything is
sincerity and love. Forrest may not have a high IQ, but he sure has a
lot of those two things.
