2005_April 30 
Not being Tom Hanks' greatest fan, I avoided watching this film for
several months after its release. This also gave me time for the hype
to die down a little - but on the back of all the press and several
positive comments I was still expecting to sit down to enjoy a good
movie.<br /><br />I was mistaken. My reward? Two hours of praying for the credits to roll
to take away the pain.<br /><br />To me this movie takes pleasure in displaying everything that is wrong
with the Hollywood film industry - America's need to rewrite history to
suit its own needs, its desire to peddle the &quot;American dream&quot; myth and
the rewards given blindly to any movie that does the above (in the form
of several Oscars - could anyone please explain to me the exceptional
qualities of the movie that put it above anything else released that
year?<br /><br />If only Forrest had kept running... into the sea
