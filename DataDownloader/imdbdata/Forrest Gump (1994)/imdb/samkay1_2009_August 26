Forrest Gump is many many things, but what it amounts to is a realist
fantasy, like Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s Fanny and Alexander or more recently,
Stranger than Fiction. It never takes itself too seriously and if you
choose to clear your mind of logical expectations, I think Forrest Gump
will put a smile on your face. It is a motion picture of pure optimism.<br /><br />The story begins on a bench in a park. On one side is Alabaman born,
Forrest Gump: a happy fellow with a box of chocolates and sub-par IQ.
He proceeds to tell the story of his life to the person on the other
side of the bench. During the course of thirty years, Gump went from
being a football star, to a Vietnam war hero, to a ping pong champion,
to a shrimp boat captain, to a business man, and ultimately to a
husband and father. His life was driven by his love for his only friend
Jenny, who ended up leading a not so successful life.<br /><br />The film is a drama, but like I said, there is a fair dose of fantasy
and comedy. The story runs pretty smoothly until the last third which
drags a bit and has perhaps one too many scenes. It reminds me of the
end to Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (It never ends!)<br /><br />Three sensational performances shine through. Gary Sinese at his best
plays Gump&#x27;s eccentric war lieutenant who is frustrated by the loss of
his legs. Robin Wright Penn at her best, is Jenny whose life is so
harsh that she is also driven to suicide, until she is emotionally
reunited with Gump. Tom Hanks leads the way with a performance
definitely worthy of the Oscar he won.<br /><br />If treated the way it should be, Forrest Gump will be worth your time.
