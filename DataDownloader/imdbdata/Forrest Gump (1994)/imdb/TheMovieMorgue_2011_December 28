Tom Hank&#x27;s second Oscar was rewarded to him for his role as the title
character in the 1995 Best Picture winner Forrest Gump; a performance
that I&#x27;d rank up with his other Oscar winning performance in
&#x22;Philadelphia&#x22; as his career&#x27;s best. Forrest Gump is a simple man
(Arguably suffering from Aspergers Syndrome) who has been to many
places, and has been unintentionally present at important points in
history. We meet him as he sits on a bus bench, waiting for the bus
that we learn is going to take him to meet his childhood sweetheart
Jenny - the one thing Forrest has chased all through his life. Forrest
tells his life story up until this point to the people sitting next to
him, a life that began in Alabama where he was an awkward kid with a
very low IQ score, up until his ability to run very fast got him
accepted into college on a football scholarship and later on to the All
American team where he got to meet the president, up until his tour of
duty fighting in the Vietnam War and his subsequent feelings and
successes afterwards. This well crafted story based on the novel by
Winstom Groom (Which I&#x27;ve heard is a very complex novel) and based off
a brilliant screenplay written by Eric Roth, and directed by &#x22;Back to
the Future&#x22; director Robert Zemeckis, captures a very interesting time
period in American history, particularly the Vietnam War and the
consequences of it on society and culture. Forrest Gump is arguably one
of the most iconic characters of the last twenty years, and is nearly a
household name at this stage. Tom Hanks is brilliant as him, and he is
backed by brilliant performances from Sally Field as Forrest&#x27;s mother,
Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan who is Forrest&#x27;s crazy platoon leader in
Vietnam, and later becomes his best friend, and Robin Wright as Jenny.
Aside from the brilliant story and acting, the visuals are impressive,
especially in the war scenes and also in the TV footage where Forrest
meets President Keenedy, Nixon and John Lennon. Their voices and lip
movements are real authentic and very well done, and Hanks is blended
very well into these scenes. Even after countless viewings over the
years, &#x22;Forrest Gump&#x22; still maintains it&#x27;s magic, and is without a
doubt one of the best movies I&#x27;ve ever seen.
