2000_April 10 

This movie is a fairy tale, and its review of US history is oversimplified
at best. But because the movie does not claim realism, these things don't
bother me the way they normally do. The movie is light and mostly funny
while you watch it, but what sticks is much deeper. It is a modern version
of a classic literary theme: the idiot who is thereby wiser than the
rest
of us.  Forrest is too dumb to hate blacks.  He is too dumb not to keep his
promises and give away his money. He is too dumb not to save Lt. Dan,
twice,
once in battle and later, through continued good will and positive
attitude,
from himself.  He is too dumb to give up on his hopeless love. One is left
inspired by this modern morality play, inspired to try to be a little
better
person, in hopes that in real life goodness
might have just a bit of the effects it has in this movie.<br /><br />I watched this movie with my kids, ages 10 and 13. It was more explicit
than
I expected for a PG-13, and halfway through I wondered if I had made a
mistake showing it to them. But no, it was a very good movie for them, for
the reasons discussed above.  Also for another reason: their knowledge of
the times of the movie was limited, and their questions from the movie
led
to several good discussions.
