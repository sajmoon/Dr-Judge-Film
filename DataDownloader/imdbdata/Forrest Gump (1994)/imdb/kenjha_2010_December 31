Dumb luck allows a moron to be present during numerous historical
events and to become fabulously rich. This film consists of numerous
amusing episodes that don&#x27;t add up to a satisfactory whole. There is so
much emphasis on cleverly incorporating Gump into historic moments that
the narrative flow suffers. As such, the skits become tiresome after a
while, especially given the excessive length of the movie. Hanks&#x27;s
performance is interesting but overdone, as he shifts from robotic to
goofy to emotional, making Gump not so much a character as a
caricature. The effects showing Gump interacting with the likes of JFK,
LBJ, Nixon, and John Lennon are well done.
