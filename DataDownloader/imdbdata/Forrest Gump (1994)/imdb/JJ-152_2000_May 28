I have only watched a handful of movies more than once, and I've watched
'Gump' from beginning to end at least 4 times.  It's what true movie-making
is all about.  An accidental hero that you can't help but care for as he
struggles through his amazing life.  The performances are all superior, but
Tom Hanks nails this role like no other actor in the history of film.  He
is
Forrest Gump.
