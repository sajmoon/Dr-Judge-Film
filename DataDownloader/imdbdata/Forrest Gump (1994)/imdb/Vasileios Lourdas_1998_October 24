Probably the best movie I've ever seen! Forrest Gump, along with
Titanic(1997), will be an unforgettable movie, a classic. After watching the
relatively long film, I couldn't get enough of it, I wanted more and more.
I'm sure you'll feel the same feelings I had after the end. I would gladly
see it once more, without being bored not even a second. I think that tells
it all.<br /><br />Tom Hanks is an excellent actor. I wish he had earned his third nomination
for best actor for Apollo 13. The next movie I'm watching is Saving Private
Ryan.<br /><br />Thanks.
