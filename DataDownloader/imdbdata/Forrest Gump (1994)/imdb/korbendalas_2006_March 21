I was only 13 when this movie came out, but it changed my life. Since
then I've seen it like 40 times and I still find it amusing. It's the
magic of the masterpiece movie that it makes you watch it over and over
and you still find something new, something valuable. There are plenty
of great movies but only one is on the top for me. Forrest Gump.
Soundtrack is brilliant, cast even better, Tom Hanks is so believable,
that you almost think that he really has IQ 74. The plot covers like 40
something years of a man, history events included in such a way that
you just have to love it. There is no other way. I think that everybody
would like to be a Forrest Gump in some way he is something like a
working class hero of the 90's. Zemeckis did a great job with this
movie, he managed to repeat it with CastAway in a different way. Hanks
is exceptionally good in roles which view him as a solitary character,
having nothing but a bunch o dreams, memories and plans.
