Just watched Forrest Gump again in a very casual way when I was
actually watching a Korean sitcom. I already watched this movie several
times before.<br /><br />Gump is below level IQ but he is happy in some degree. At least he
could love Jenny although their relation is kind of complex. You can
say it is fragile but deeply rooted in both hearts like nostalgic. You
can say this movie is not a masterpiece but it is very touching. In
67th Academy Award, it is the winner against other four movies like the
Shawshank Redemption and FW and AF. Either have strong advantages over
Forrest Gump. But Gump is deeply rooted in the red soil of southern
USA- this great continent. FW and AF or Shawshank can happen everywhere
but Gump is irreplaceable because it tightly is associated with the
history of USA!<br /><br />For some people, they can not find their true lovers but have to marry
because of some pressures. Am I to be one of them sometime?
