Forrest Gump <br /><br />As in the words of Forest Gumps all-knowing mother, &quot;Life is like a box
of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get&quot;. How true. Life is
unpredictable. You never know what's coming, what will happen tomorrow,
who you'll meet and what kind of influence that person will have on
your life.<br /><br />Forrest Gump is about a very simple, simple man. An by being as honest
as one can be, and being nice to all, and just purely innocent, this
man does extraordinary things. Life hands him all kinds of strange
opportunities, some even HUGE events of the twenty first century. Some
people say this is about an idiot becoming a rich man? No, it's about a
GOOD man, a truly honest, hard-working, man-of-his-word guy, who
becomes successful through the goodness and innocence of his ways. He
cheats for nothing, and so life rewards him in great ways.<br /><br />We first meet Forrest sitting on a bench, where he then begins to tell
his story to the many who come to sit next to him. What a story it is.
Forrest has been a football star, an army war hero of the Vietnam, a
half-owner of a billion dollar fishing company, a ping-pong world
champion, and a superstar celebrity runner. And he's managed two visits
to the white house, and he once met Elvis Presley. He also influenced
the creation of famous bumper stickers and t-shirts. Whew. It shows
what can come to those who just live life truthfully. And all this
while, Forrest pines for his one true love; his first ever friend:
Jenny.<br /><br />Forrest Gump is full of great things. The screenplay tells an
extraordinary tale, and is full of memorable lines, simplistic enough
to be understood, and subtle enough to be considered more.<br /><br />As Forrest journeys to Vietnam's jungles, and runs across the U.S's
many and varied landscapes, we see absolutely beautiful cinematography.
All the backdrops are wonderful, especially the ones of Forest's long
run.<br /><br />The hilarious visual effects put Forrest into old video clips, and
never for a second do they look like a hoax. Truly great job.<br /><br />The acting couldn't be better. Gary Sinise is cynically perfect as LT.
Dan, Forrest's commander from the Vietnam, who becomes one of Forrest's
best friends. He's the second best of the show, really capturing the
man's sardonic humor and anger. Sally Field's is great as Forrest's
wise mother. She teaches him everything he needs to know, and plays the
part excellently. Robin Wright Penn plays Jenny, the girl Forrest is
obsessively in love with. She plays the role well, having good
chemistry with Tom Hanks. She never yells at him, but doesn't exactly
treat him right, she almost talks stupid to him, for most of the film
(until the end...). And Tom Hanks truly IS Forrest Gump, in his
greatest role, and one of the best performances I've ever seen. Every
line is delivered with perfect simplicity. His accent: flawless. His
tone, and attitude never waver. In some actor's hands, the role easily
could have become stupid. But not in Tom Hank's. He plays Forrest real,
not overly stupid-sounding or slow talking. Rather...he talks a lot.<br /><br />Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future I,II,III) directs the timeless
classic of how great life can be. His direction ranges from war, to
sporting events, to quiet scenes, to running scenes, to scenes with
thousands crowded around, to scenes of old videos, and then sea-faring
scenes. Only a very well-rounded director could pull all this off with
the smooth transitioning Robert does. Even with all these different
elements in the film, Zemeckis goes from one to the other, with no
problem, and no break in the flow. It's edited smoothly. He makes all
the elements of a drama, comedy, love story, and a war story come
together smoothly. He tells the story of one man's extraordinary life
brilliantly.<br /><br />Forrest Gump is the tale of one man's triumph by being honest. Maybe we
should all try it sometime. 10/10 <br /><br />&quot;Stupid is as stupid does&quot;-Forrest Gump
