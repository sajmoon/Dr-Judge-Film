Forrest Gump is easily the best film ever made. It has a great script,
superb acting and direction, it is funny and also sad and has a brilliant
soundtrack, and some well done special effects.
Tom Hanks delivers the best performance I have ever seen, his acting in a
couple of scenes towards the end of the film made me cry - a well deserved
academy award.
Robin Wright Penn was very good as Jenny and Mykelti Williamson was
hilarious as &quot;bubba,&quot; but Gary Sinise should have got a best supporting
Oscar as Lt. Dan
Forrest Gump's involvement in some of the most famous historic moments
also
made this film a real treat.
Pure class.
