There are few films that come along, that will capture your; heart,
mind and soul. This is one such film. There will never come a point
when I will ever grow tired of seeing this film, or when it will ever
not make me cry.<br /><br />Tom Hanks gives one of the best performances of his career as &#39;Forest
Gump&#39;. This film centers around the life of one man, who&#39;s choices and
luck, bring the world circled around his life. Meeting the President of
the United States, solving crimes by accident, battling in the war in
Vietnam, finding true love, and touching people&#39;s lives.<br /><br />The movie takes place throughout ten or twelve years of a mentally slow
man&#39;s life, who has a way of moving, and touching your very heart.<br /><br />Robin Wright Penn also gives an outstanding performance, as Jenny,
Forest&#39;s true love.<br /><br />Sally Field also has a small part, playing Tom Hanks&#39; mother, and does
a very comical and dramatic job.<br /><br />It&#39;s a film that will stay in the hearts of many, for years to come.
