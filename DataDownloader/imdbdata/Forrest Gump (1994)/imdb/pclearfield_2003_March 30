Forrest Gump is one of the best movies ever. Period. The acting is
amazing,
and even though it came out in 1994, it's still a blast to watch. Tom
Hanks
so perfectly captures the role, it's like watching an auto-biography. The
war is perfectly captured, and so is everything else. Just one tiny
problem-
it's to long at 142 minutes. Oh well. 10/10.
