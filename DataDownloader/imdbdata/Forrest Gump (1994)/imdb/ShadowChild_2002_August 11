To say that this movie is only good for Americans would be nonsense. Even if
you don't have a clue about the American history - this movie is a
contribution to the human soul! I can't find the words to describe how
special it is... I can't even say that Tom Hanks was great in it, because to
me it wasn't an actor, to me Forrest Gump is real... Tom Hanks surpassed
himself, which is hard to imagine... He's just a phenomenon. Ever since I
was little, this is just more than a movie to me.
