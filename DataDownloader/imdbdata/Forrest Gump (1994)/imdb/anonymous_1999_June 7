1999_June 7 

I usually do not write comments about films that I hate, but this film
sucked so bad that I had to make an exception. This is one of the 10 worst
films I have seen in my life. My profound apologies go out to those of you
who loved this film, but I just couldn't stand it.<br /><br />Let's start with the plot, wait a minute, there is no plot. The only point
of the film is seeing a not so bright man make his way through 30 years of
history. Throughout his life, he fought in Vietnam, and saved Gary
Sinise's
life, who was very unappreciative of Forrest for doing so. He becomes a
multi-millionaire in the shrimp business, he wins the international
ping-pong tournament, meets 3 presidents, discovers the Watergate
break-in,
sees his mother pass away, and then wastes 3 1/2 years of his life
literally
running from coast to coast and back again. (right), and finally his one
and
only love comes back to him only because she is dying of cancer. Forrest
Gump has been called the best feel good film of the 1990's, but I didn't
feel good after seeing this film, and it's $350 million in the box office
didn't inspire me to enjoy this film.<br /><br />The thing that surprises me the most about Forrest Gump was the fact that
it
took the Best Picture Oscar, even over Pulp Fiction, and The Shawshank
Redemption. Two films that are so far superior to this one that I can't
even
believe it. For those of you who have not seen Forrest Gump, you're
fortunate.
