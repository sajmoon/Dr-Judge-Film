This wasn't a bad movie...it is an OK movie..but an OSCAR award winning
movie?? I agree with other posters that Shawshank Redemption and Morgan
Freeman should've received the Oscars in 95. I got nothing out of Gump, in
fact, I don't even remember what the movie is about except that Hanks
undeservingly won an award for his portrayal of a villiage idiot. Meanwhile,
I own a copy of shawshank and I can always watch it when the time is right.
Shawshank is a great movie to watch. It is no surprise today that Gump is
ranked in the bottom of IMDB top list at #172 while Redemption is #2...what
a travesty of justice bought on by the Academy that a movie like Gump wins
an oscar over Shawshank.
