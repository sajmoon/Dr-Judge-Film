When I was a kid I loved Forrest Gump. Now I dont love it. Dont get me
wrong, its a good movie with an interesting idea but now I just dont love it
anymore. <br /><br />The plot is interesting because it focus's on a man that doesnt matter and
puts him into these big historical events. Tom Hanks brilliantly plays
Forrest Gump and deserved his oscar. Gary Sinise was very good. Robin Wright
Penn was average at best, she is just not a good actress. Sally Field is
good as Forrest's Mom. <br /><br />The movie is well written and pretty well directed. But I just dont think it
deserved Best Picture. Its Oscar material but definitely not oscar winning
except for Hanks. It won because it was the most sentimental of the
nominees, I suppose. Shawshank Redemption was a better movie and Pulp
Fiction was better than both.
