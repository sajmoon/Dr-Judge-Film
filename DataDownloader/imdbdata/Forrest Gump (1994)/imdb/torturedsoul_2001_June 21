I have seen Forrest Gump about 15 times, and every time it drives me to
tears. It shows how a man who is not exactly &quot;right&quot; can be very successful
and lead a full life. I hear people all the time criticize this movie, but
why? How can't you love this movie? Forrest is so likeable and the
filmmakers even succeed in making some humorous parts which is not normal in
most dramas. Tom Hanks pulls in a great acting performance as Forrest and
their are other great performances, also. Too many of them to name. It
deserved that Oscar. I feel that wholeheartedly. I give it an
A+.
