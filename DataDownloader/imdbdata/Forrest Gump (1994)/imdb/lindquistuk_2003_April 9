2003_April 9 

A slyly reactionary movie - kinda the republican's handbook for good,<br /><br />clean livin'. 'Gump' would like to perpetuate the myth that the best way<br /><br />to get ahead in today's America is to be asexual, stupid and do as<br /><br />you're told...Heaven forbid you should be a peace-loving, free thinking<br /><br />liberal - for your troubles you should expect a childhood filled with<br /><br />abuse, followed by drug-addled suicidal tendencies, an unhappy love-life<br /><br />and, ultimately, death by a coyly unspecified disease.<br /><br />In short, 'Forrest Gump' is about as politically progressive as 'Reefer<br /><br />Madness', and the movie's technical proficiency just makes it's message<br /><br />all the more unpalatable..............3/10<br /><br />........
