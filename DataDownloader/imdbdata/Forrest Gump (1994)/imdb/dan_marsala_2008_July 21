I&#39;d chose this movie the &quot;other number one&quot; on my top, not because the
Schindler List be better, only because I&#39;ve already considered
Schindler the best movie I have ever seen when I saw Forrest Gump.<br /><br />I&#39;m not sure of how can I talk about how much I&#39;d lean by watching this
movie. This one was an inspiration to all my family, starring with my
dad, that was the one who told me to sit up and watch it with him. The
only thing I can say with out fear to mistake is that this is one of
the few movies that I can sit and watch over and over and over and over
again. I can easily say that I watch it over 100 times in the 2001.Its
right now that I realize the hard work and the magnitude of the
production of a movie like this.<br /><br />The Tom Hanks performance is the heart of the success of this movie. He
create one of the most charming characters on the history. He lived the
horrors that many suffer in that years tanks to the American ambition
and trough is eyes everything looks just fine. Through his eyes
everything seems so beautiful. The way Forrest live his life his kinda
lesson to my own life.<br /><br />The movie itself is a wonder creation. This is the kind of Beautiful
films that deserve the Best Picture Oscar and deserve to be remembered.
The conflict between Forrest and Schindler will continue. Till then, I
have two number one.<br /><br />Thats it.
