Yes, I watched in awe as Tom Hanks was digitally inserted into all the major
events of the second half of the twentieth century, but my already opened
jaw then went slack at the banality of the screenplay.<br /><br />Sorry, but &quot;Life is like a box of chocolates&quot; is not a philosophy for a
grownup. Or even a retard.<br /><br />I loved the opening shot, and was really wanting to like this film, but
Sally Field is embarrassing, ditto Tom Hanks. Gary Sinise is good, but Robin
Wright's character makes no sense.<br /><br />There IS no moral or philosophical coherence to this film ... it just allows
woolly thinkers around the world to project their own feel good mantras onto
it.<br /><br />I give it a 5 for technical achievement<br /><br />(I stand by for the usual tirade of illiterate and obscene abuse I get when
I dare to criticise a sacred cow.)
