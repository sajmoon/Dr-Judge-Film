Typical Tom Hanks vehicle that should never have rolled out of the garage.
A
mixture of yokel and idiot savant, Hanks is as bland as ever in this role.
Gurk gurk gurk. The best parts of this film are the supporting actors.
Hanks
should go back to his bachelor party.<br /><br />Life is like a box of chocolates, and these ones have gone
off...
