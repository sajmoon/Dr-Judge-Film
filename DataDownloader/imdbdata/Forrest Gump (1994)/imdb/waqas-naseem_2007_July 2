Forrest Gump is an outstanding movie. Every bit of the movie is
classical. It touches the heart of the viewers on every scene. I love
watching the movie. Its different from conventional movies as it has a
strong plot and is closed to reality and fascination at the same time.
The cast is good. Especially the way Tom Hanks has performed. Its a
family movie. Its a ever green movie. I recommend this movie to
everyone.It touches the heart of the viewers on every scene. I love
