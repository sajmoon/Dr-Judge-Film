2004_April 17 

I had heard a lot about this film before I actually saw it, and the idea of
a man unwittingly being present at the biggest moments of four decades
seemed funny and entertaining enough. But I was heavily
disappointed.<br /><br />What Forrest Gump lacks most is a stringent storytelling. The movie just
doesn&acute;t get off the ground. It isn&acute;t the fault of the actors in general and
certainly not of Tom Hanks, who gives a brilliant storyteller and doesn&acute;t
make pure slapstick out of the dimwitted Forrest - the actors are doing fine
jobs. It&acute;s the fault of the filmmakers. Lots of shots and even whole motives
are plainly useless, not even in adding atmosphere, a lot of plot turns
vanish into nothingness. The touching moments are soaked in corny music and
lose their emotional potential, the technically great TV montages get less
entertaining every time because they are wasted in bad punchlines. The whole
dialogue is highly predictable. The reenactment of the Hippie movement is
quite sound, and details like the Watergate joke are good laughs, but the
scenes in between are painfully slow, at the end even simply boring. About a
thousand times you are led to believe that there is a deeper moral than
&quot;enjoy your life with the things you can do really good&quot; (this being
introduced at the very beginning), but it isn&acute;t. <br /><br />I don&acute;t know what, except for the few gags that really function, could earn
this movie the triumph that it had and still has. Watch &quot;Hair&quot; for the
Sixties and &quot;Harold and Maude&quot; for the moral, you will be better
off.
