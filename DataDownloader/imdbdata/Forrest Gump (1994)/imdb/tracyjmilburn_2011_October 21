I was very shocked to see this movie only has an 8.3 out of 10.<br /><br />There is sooo much going on in this movie...<br /><br />The best thing about this movie, is that Forrest &#x22;always did the right
thing, no matter what cost.&#x22; People in the movie made fun of him for
being &#x22;stupid&#x22; yet we as a society seem to reward/idolize people who
are cunning who often do bad things. When Forrest had to go back into a
jungle that was being blown up, he didn&#x27;t even think about whether it
was a good thing to do for his own safety, he just did it. He always
stuck up for Jenny when someone was hurting her in any way; again he
didn&#x27;t hesitate, he just did what he felt in his heart was the right
thing to do.<br /><br />The other thing is, all the historical parts of this movie. So many
pieces of American History were visited! That alone was worth watching.
Working Elvis into it was really funny, as was the part where he gets
shot.<br /><br />I also loved the music, almost every song in the movie was
perfectly-fit for the scene it was in.<br /><br />The acting, obviously, was superb... Gary Sinese was a breakout role
IMHO. Loved him in this.<br /><br />What an amazing, epic movie. IMHO, this was 100x better than the
Godfather, or Gone with the Wind, which often gets rated much higher.
Forrest Gump was simple and pure, a timeless movie no person should go
without watching.<br /><br />-Tracy Milburn
