One of the most inspiring movies I ever seen ! Forrest not only show us
that ingenuity is a gift (I want mine back!) but decision is crucial in
life, maybe his retarded condition private him from hesitation on
important decisions, such a big advantage over the rest of regular
&#x22;intelligent&#x22; people. While the film exaggerates a bit, Forrest with
his initiative undertake and reach more goals and lives more
intensively his life than the rest of average &#x22;smarter&#x22; men. By not
having a life&#x27;s vision, Forrest confront every challenge one for one
doing his life an exciting playground, achieving more, doing more and
helping others more, meanwhile most of us &#x22;the normals&#x22; are typecast in
our boring routine. Who is smarter ?
