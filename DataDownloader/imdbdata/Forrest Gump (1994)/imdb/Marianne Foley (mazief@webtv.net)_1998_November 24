1998_November 24 

I find it interesting that this picture won an Oscar over Pulp Fiction and
The Shawshank Redemption, BOTH of which were better movies, in my opinion.<br /><br />I also find it interesting that Robin Wright as Jenny wasn't nominated, when
I thought her performance was one of the GOOD things about the movie. She
seemed to be the only person involved with the film the Academy ignored that
year.<br /><br />The movie wasn't terrible, but it was too long, overly sentimental and not
especially memorable. I did think Tom Hanks delivered a fine performance,
but I don't know if I'd term it a &quot;Best Actor&quot; caliber performance
either.<br /><br />Basically, an overrated, over-hyped movie.
