1998_August 3 
A much more likable character than the one in the original novel, Forrest
takes us on a surreal tour of every major event in the period during the
birth of the civil rights movement and the anti-war era. He is so simple,
open, and direct, that the audience can't help but like him. The film is at
various times funny, sad, exciting, and moving. Tom Hanks so personified
this modern Huck Finn that he well deserved his second Oscar.
