Robert Zemeckis is a name Cinema Salutes. Reason? He has made
remarkable films, that have always touched a chord. But, some people
believe his Cinema is not good enough, and he ain&#x27;t worthy enough for
what he has achieved. Now I advocate to those anti-Zemeckis&#x27;s, Watch
&#x27;Forrest Gump&#x27;, and you would yourself become a fan of this man and
take your words back.<br /><br />IMDb writes: &#x27;Forrest Gump&#x27;, while not intelligent, has accidentally
been present at many historic moments, but his true love, Jenny, eludes
him. Is this really the meaning behind this 1994-Blockbuster? I am a
Cinema Devotee, and My Verdict on this film is: This is a film above
words, my summary correctly copies that. It&#x27;s a journey of a man left
alone, it&#x27;s his journey to Win his LOVE, and finally become a proud
citizen.<br /><br />About 140 Minutes long, &#x27;Forrest Gump&#x27; unfolds fearlessly. This is
Robert Zemeckis&#x27;s finest work to date. His cinema has never been so
engaging before. Eric Roth&#x27;s adapted screenplay provides liberties to
it&#x27;s historical HERO. Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump &#x26; Gary Sinise, as one
of Forrest&#x27;s important people in his journey, pack in performances,
that can surely be described as, &#x22;Tour De Force&#x22;. Robin Wright as
Jenny, becomes the beauty of her time and brings in spontaneity in her
character.<br /><br />On the whole, Easily One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made, to pseudo,
that sentence in Caps, is an understatement.
