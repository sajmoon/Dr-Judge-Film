Forrest Gump is a classic. A film in which people cry, laugh and are
even shocked. Tom Hanks gives one of the greatest performances of all
time in movie history. He won an Oscar for the role of Forrest Gump,
and darn right he should have. Where do you start with a great movie
like this? I think the way Forrest is so..dumb, people want to see what
is going to happen next. If it was a normal guy, well he would propose
to Jenny on the spot. He wouldn't listen to everything his mama said,
and you wouldn't have such a good film. Forrest goes through just about
everything. His best good friend dies, his mama dies and someone else
dies that's close to him. Forrest Gump is a great, great film. Watch
it. My mama always said if you watch a good movie, you'll have a good
heart. :)
