<br /><br />It never ceases to amaze me that many folks heap criticism onto this very
simple and wonderful FAIRY TALE.  They look for complexity and messages
where there are none, then cannot buy into the obviously fantastic and
utterly improbable life of Forrest Gump due to the irrationality involved,
and then somehow miss the entire point of the movie!<br /><br />Simply because it is set in modern times some look to this fairy tale for
messages about right wing conservatism, the USA's role in Vietnam, the
American Dream, etc.<br /><br />It's not about any of those things.  It's about a simpleton who knows what
love, loyalty, family, and friendship are, and their importance in life.
It's about those around him who come to realize that perhaps the simpleton
has more of a clue as to what is TRULY important in life than they
do.<br /><br />Hanks' performance is excellent, as is Robin Wright's and Gary Sinise's.
The direction is also top notch, as is the sound track, special effects, and
scenery.  Heck, it's just a pretty damn awesome movie.<br /><br />This movie will be remembered as the &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; of our
generation.<br /><br />Mark
