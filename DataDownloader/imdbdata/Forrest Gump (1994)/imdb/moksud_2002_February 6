WE lived, we live and we will. chronology sets the record, but emotions
flow
through without any documents, in our chromosomes. we nurture them from
ages
and die with them. but the seeds remain.
this movie is not only history. its the hereditary transportation of human
lives. its the wonderful portrait of a changing America, the powerful
nation, and a very simple yet a gifted man who lived through these
changes.
the oral expression is his, but the view, its left on to you. it is not
only
viewing. it is the best hangover that will last for quite a
while!
