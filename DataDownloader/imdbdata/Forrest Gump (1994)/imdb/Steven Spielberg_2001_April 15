This IS the worlds greatest Drama. It has everything a Drama should
have.
Great cast &amp; crew: Tom Hanks in his greatest role in his career. Gary sinise
also in his lifes role.
best directed picture. He has done good films before Forrest Gump, but this
one is special.
I love the producers of Gump because they dared to do it.
The screenwriter as well. 
The technical part of the movie is fantastic. Sound, sound effects editing,
cinematography, editing and last but not least visual effects.
The original score is realy touching.
And we have a masterful story to see.
So this masterpiece is worlds greatest Drama and the best Drama i have ever
seen.
