2003_March 7 

I've seen this one eleven times. No, it is not my record: I've seen
Scooby-Doo fourteen times. But this one was different because it really hit
me deep at the very first viewing. And I cried every single time I saw it,
which is very unusual of me. I also had a laugh and wondered at the images
and the food for thought that is scattered through it. Some people say its
message is very conservative, but I believe it manages to be a different
movie to every viewer. It is more like a mirror: the way you see it is the
way you see yourself. Maybe all films are like that in a way, but this here
is a true fable about beliefs. Beyond the tears and laughter, you get to see
how chance helps a lot, but mostly it is the way he sees the world that gets
the guy the world he gets to live in. I do believe this movie says we should
try to be true to our sense of what's good, and that's about all we can do
in this crazy wonderful world. I'm just grateful for this film, for it did
me good.
