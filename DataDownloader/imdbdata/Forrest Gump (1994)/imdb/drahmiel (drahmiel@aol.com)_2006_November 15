This is one of the worst movies of all time. It is nothing more than an
expensive, intricate jigsaw puzzle and none of the characters have
redeeming value with the possible exception of Forrest&#39;s mother. His
love interest Jenny is a vile human being and at no time did I want
Forrest to end up with her. The off putting message IS in fact that you
can be an idiot and be successful, and in fact suggests that it might
be better to be so. The idea that skills that many people find so
difficult to master all come so easily to a simpleton like Forrest is
offensive. Its saving grace is that the book is even worse. I don&#39;t
understand what people love about this movie, which is vastly
overrated.
