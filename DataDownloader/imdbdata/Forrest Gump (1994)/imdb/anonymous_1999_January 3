1999_January 3 

The most dishonest, hypocritical movie ever made.  It disguises its
right-wing political message by using Gump to cover up its commentary on the
60s--which is profoundly nasty and negative.  He is a hero because he can
ignore all the social evils around him--is that not a commentary?  I
understand that the moviemakers denied they were trying to send a message.
They lie.  I'll take my political propaganda straight,
please.
