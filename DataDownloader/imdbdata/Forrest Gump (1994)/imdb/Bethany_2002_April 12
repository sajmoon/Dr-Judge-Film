I loved pretty much everything about this movie. I've seen it so many
times,
I can recite it word for word. I follow anything Tom Hanks does, simply
because he's brilliant and can become whatever he desires, a slow
Southerner, an astronaut, a hopeless romantic, a sneaky suburban, a police
detective...I love each and every one of his movies regardless how cheesy
(ie: Joe vs. the Volcano). But it wasn't just Tom that did it, Gary Sinise,
Robert Zemekis, Robin Wright, Sally Field, Mykelti Williamson...loved it
all.
