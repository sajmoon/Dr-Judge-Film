Forest Gump (1994)<br /><br />&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is the definitive movie for all times. Just as films like
&quot;To
Kill a Mockingbird&quot; or &quot;The Way We Were&quot; have not lost their freshness
over
the decades, similarly &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; will be appreciated 40 years hence,
and even beyond.<br /><br />It is amazing how the period songs and period events have been kept at the
periphery but delicately strung into the main story. One cannot but admire
the way the &quot;stupid&quot; man, who had an IQ of 75 when he was small, regards
the
events that are going around him in this crazy world with remarkable
equanimity. Life and its forces, in all its turbulence and romance, find
expression through many angles by way of many different characters who
enter
into Forrest's life. How many attitudes towards life are portrayed here? I
believe it is a difficult question to answer.<br /><br />But finally, what comes out of all this jazz is the beauty of life. A
strong
belief in life and a great hope, such as the great hope that &quot;The Great
Dictator&quot; gave, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; gives. Each time someone sees the film, the
world becomes a little bit better. I believe that this film is a very good
contender to be the Movie of the 1990's.
