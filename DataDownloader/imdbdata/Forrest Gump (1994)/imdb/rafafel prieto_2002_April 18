This was one of my coolest experiences on a theater...this movie makes me
wanna cry almost every sigle time i see it (even now),,,,i've seen it
almost
50 times and always produces me the same reacction...that's why i gave it
10.....'coz that 's what i think an excelent movie should do......on the
fxs......god!!!!,,,it's so realistic that you really believe that his is
doinig,all that you see on the  screem is so trutfull tha you  bought
it,,,,it's a clasic and i think it should be upper on this
rank...<br /><br />
