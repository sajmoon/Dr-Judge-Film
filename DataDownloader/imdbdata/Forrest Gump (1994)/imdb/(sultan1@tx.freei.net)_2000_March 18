This movie is very good. To this day I still consider it as one of the best
movies ever made. If I ever have grand kids this is the movie I want to
watch with them. This movie can be passed down from generation to generation
and people of all ages will still love it!! It`s too bad some of the critics
don`t know a classic when they see it.  Rating (best of five stars)...5.
