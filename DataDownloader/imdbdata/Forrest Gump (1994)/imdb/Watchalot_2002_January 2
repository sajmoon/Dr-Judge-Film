This must be one of the most offensive movies ever made and I am truly
appalled at the central theme, namely that being stupid makes you a better
person.  Everything about this film is patronising and overwrought.  Can't
believe that Tom Hanks (surely the most over-rated actor on the planet)
won
an Oscar for this pulp and if this was the best film of 1994 then god help
us all.<br /><br />Don't waste your money at the video store - rent something (anything)
other
than this garbage.
