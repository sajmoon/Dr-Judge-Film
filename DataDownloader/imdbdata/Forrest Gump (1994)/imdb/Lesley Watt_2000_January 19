I loved this movie and I've watched it 26 times! I watched it one night with
my mum and dad when I was eight years old and I enjoyed it. I'm almost 13
now. Anyway, I watched it again and then when I got a good report card I was
allowed a video and I immediately chose this one. Since then I've watched it
24 times and 2 before that. I've never watched anything else as much as this
one.
