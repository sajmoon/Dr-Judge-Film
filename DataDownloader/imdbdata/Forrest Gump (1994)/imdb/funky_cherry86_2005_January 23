When I first watched this film ten years ago it was a wonderful and
captivating story and has still remained a favorite in my top ten list
of movies. Forrest Gump (Hanks) is a man with a low I.Q. whose been
involved in many historical events. While at a bus stop he tells
numerous people about the story of his life starting from when he was a
boy growing up in Alabama.Along the way he talks about meeting his
childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran (Penn) , being a football player, a
Vietnam war hero, a professional ping pong player and shrimp boat
captain. But nothing compared to the love he had for Jenny who always
managed to elude him over the years. Towards the end she tells him that
he has a son Forrst Gump Jr.(Osment) and that she has a virus and
doesn&#x27;t have much time left. They get married and Jenny dies not too
long after wards. Forrest Gump is one of the best dramatic films of all
time Tom Hanks gave an academy award winning performance that captured
the eyes of viewers everywhere. The rest of the cast Mykelti
Williamson, Gary Sinise, Robin Wright Penn and Sally Field also did a
phenomenal job
