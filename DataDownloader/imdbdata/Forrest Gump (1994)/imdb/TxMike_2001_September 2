Everything that needs to be said about the story of &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; has been
said.  It won the Oscar in 1994 over such great films as &quot;Shawshank
Redemption.&quot; Tom Hanks is super as Gump. A full two-thirds (67%) of IMDB
votes are either 8, 9, or 10, and it's real rating is somewhere in there. I
personally rate it a strong &quot;9&quot;.<br /><br />This week the DVD version was released, and I bought a copy. It is actually
2 disks, one for the movie and the second for the &quot;extras.&quot; The movie is
widescreen in Digital Dolby 5.1, and sound is great as one should expect of
this film. Also, the video is sharp and the colors are accurate. Two
different selectable commentaries are both very good. You really can't ask
for more.<br /><br />The second disk is packed with interesting &quot;extras.&quot;  Many of the visual
effects are explained, and I found them captivating. It is rare that we get
to see so much &quot;behind the scenes&quot; information. The feature on &quot;sound
design&quot; is in Dolby Digital 5.1, which is appropriate, and all the other
tracks are in Pro Logic. Original auditions are included, as well as a
couple of deleted scenes. <br /><br />Any fan of the movie &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; really should own this DVD.  If you
don't have a DVD player yet, then maybe it's time!!
