This is another movie on my top 5 list. Forrest Gump is probably one of
the best movies ever made.<br /><br />When I was younger, I saw the preview of it somewhere, and thought it
would be boring. Then a few years later, it turned out I was wrong. I
saw the preview trailer once again, and then thought it might be really
enjoyable.<br /><br />I found the 2 Disc DVD at an appliance store, where they sell some
movies and games, etc. It was $3.99, so I bought it. After I was done
the movie, I was just simply amazed. I&#39;m surprised it was only $3.99
and not perhaps $9.99.<br /><br />Rent this movie, you won&#39;t be disappointed.<br /><br />10 stars out of 10
