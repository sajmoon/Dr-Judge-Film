&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is a story about a boy and later a man who has the IQ of
75, but even a person with normal IQ is not so noble. Forrest Gump
stays true to himself till the very end of the movie thought he
realizes that he is not as smart as other people. This understanding
makes him able to accept anything that happens in his life and be
&quot;strong&quot;. The theme of &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; seems to be easy but at the same
time it is very serious because it touches important issues such as
war, not being like other people, fight for the right to be equal and
many others. Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award for his role
in Forrest Gump. Tom Hanks is a wonderful actor that he gets into the
skin of Forrest Gump&#39;s silly role. He expresses a wide range of emotion
that I empathize with his acting. In the beginning of &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; --
&quot;Life&#39;s like a box of chocolates. You never know what you&#39;re gonna
get.&quot; This is with a young nurse gives a hint what the main actor&#39;s
life will be. ). Forrest Gump is very strong as it strives for fighting
the stereotype of discriminating disabled people. It may be said that
it is one of the greatest movies
