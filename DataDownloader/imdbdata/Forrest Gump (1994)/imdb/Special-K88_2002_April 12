Tom Hanks is riveting as a naive, slow-witted southerner who, despite
the obstacles that life continually throws at him, experiences years of
history without ever fully realizing the significance of the changing
times around him. His powerful, emotionally in-depth journey takes him
through the bitter integration of public school systems, an
unexpectedly glorious college football career, a tour of duty through
Vietnam, fame and fortune as an unlikely shrimp boat captain, all the
while staying true to his uninformed but gripping will and
determination. Takes its time to unfold, but the result is a
well-crafted, insightful, and in-depth historical journey played to
perfection by Hanks and his talented co-stars. Simply wonderful. ***&frac12;
