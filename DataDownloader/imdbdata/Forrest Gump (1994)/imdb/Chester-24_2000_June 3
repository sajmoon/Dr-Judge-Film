Forrest Gump is the best movie of 1994. The only other movie that comes
close is Ed Wood. What makes this movie so great and enjoyable is that
everything is so interesting. I've seen this movie a hundred times, and I
never lose interest. The performances are so great. Tom Hanks gives the
performance of his great career. He makes you think even when he just sits
there and stares. Like when he is just sitting there on the porch
thinking.
Also Gary Sinise is superb as Dan Taylor. Mykelti Williamson is memerable
as
Gumps kind of lugish friend Bubba. And Sally Field is great like always.<br /><br />Although this film is through the eyes of a very simple man, it is about
a
big question. Do we all have a destiny in life or are we all just floating
like a feather on a breeze? Gump tries to find this out but all he finds
out
the only things important in life is the love of true friends, and family.
Nothing else matters. Not awards from presidents, being a football star,
or
being a shrimping tycoon. Only being in the arms of your true love.<br /><br />This movie is superb in every way. Every one in America should see this
film.
