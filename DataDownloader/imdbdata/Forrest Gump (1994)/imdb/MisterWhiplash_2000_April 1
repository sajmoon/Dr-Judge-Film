Winston Groom's Forrest Gump was a novel that was complicated, but (Oscar
winning) director Robert Zemeckis brings events together with visual effects
that boggle even George Lucas. <br /><br />And leading the film in this odyssey of American life is Tom Hanks playing
Gump (he won his second Oscar for his portrayal) in a film that shows one
man who goes through many events in history to find the one he loves.  Well
done, well acted, and well directed to pythagorean procision.
