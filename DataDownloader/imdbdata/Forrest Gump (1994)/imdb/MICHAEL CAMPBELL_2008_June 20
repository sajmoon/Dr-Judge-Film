I think this movie (I haven&#39;t read book) seems to have an agenda. The
main character is mindless but works hard at everything, so he fits
into the American Way. Part of his mindlessness is a basically loving
nature. This movie is saying that as long as you pick a direction, work
hard, put the needs of others before yourself, and be persistent then
you will wind up ahead of the game. You will have a basis of wealth, a
home, and you won&#39;t have un-necessarily exposed yourself to diseases of
the mind or body.<br /><br />If, on the other hand, you have a mind and set out to change or improve
conditions in the world, you are a fool.<br /><br />That&#39;s what I get from this and I am somewhat offended because if there
is any credence to the philosophy that this movie advances, then I must
be the fool.<br /><br />If anyone sees where I am wrong in my interpretation of this story I
welcome comments, as I am very much in the beginning stages of
analyzing stories. This one got me in particular.<br /><br />Anyway, the agenda that I am referring to would be Conservatism.
