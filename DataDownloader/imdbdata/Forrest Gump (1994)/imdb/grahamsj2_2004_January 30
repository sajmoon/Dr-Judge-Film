I found this to be an entertaining film, certainly. However, I just
don't see it as one of the top 250 films of all time. Tom Hanks does a
great job playing Forrest Gump throughout the film. Sally Field as his
mother is also quite good, so the problem isn't with the acting. The
story is a shade weak, I think. It skips around a good bit and ends up
slightly disjointed. Overall, the story is OK, but not 6 Academy Awards
worth. It's trying to preach a sermon about ordinary (or less) people
being able to make it, yet the message gets lost in the rambling story.
I just don't think it was quite in the league that it currently finds
itself in. All in all, a very good film, but not a great one. Looks
like I'm in the minority, though!
