Forrest Gump, from a humble afflicted childhood, and with a low IQ,
goes on to play a major part in the history of the second part of the
20th century.<br /><br />Forrest Gump is one of those movies that comes along every once in a
while to light a fuse under the movie worlds bottom! The sort of film
that has evident flaws yet packs in so much charm, wit, intelligence
and sentiment to make it really difficult to dislike with any sort of
conviction. Even those with an aversion to the talent of Tom Hanks
would surely be kidding themselves if they honestly fail to see that
Hanks, as Gump, gives anything less than an extraordinary performance.<br /><br />What made Forrest Gump such a well loved picture? Garnering 5 golden
baldies at the Academy Awards {three of them the main ones} and earning
a staggering $677,387,716 worldwide after being made for the now
relatively paltry sum of $55 million? Personally I think it has a
little of everything that a film watcher wants in a picture, it sure
does have things many dislike {the romantic arc, the overdose of sugary
sentiment}, but as Forrest lurches from each apparently none-plussed
situation to another, the air of the underdog coming thru triumphant
sticks in the craw, but, in a most appetising way. We are in the
company of a perfectly honest, simple and innocent man, he may not know
it, but Forrest Gump has become a champion of the people, both in the
film and to us the movie loving public.<br /><br />If by some miracle you still haven&#x27;t seen Forrest Gump, then I urge you
to do so, it may not resonate with you as much as it did/does the
majority {argue with the box office I say}, but for towering
performances by Tom Hanks and Gary Sinise, and for being a clever movie
with its finger on the pulse of Hollywood, Forrest Gump has few peers.
9/10
