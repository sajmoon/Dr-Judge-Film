Forrest Gump is a wonderful told movie about a young boy being raised
by his mother. Growing up handicapped, and living in Alabama is
different then most kids. Tom Hanks is by favorite actor, and I believe
FORREST GUMP is one of his best roles. Forrest Gump is my favorite
movie of all time. I love that movie to death. Alongside, I Am Sam,
John Q, and Where the Heart Is. Forrest Gump is a great movie to show
your kids, your family, and everyone closest to you. I give this movie
a wonderful thumbs up. Tom Hanks, Sally Field, Robin Wright, and Gary
Sinise star as an amazing cast in this film. No one could replace them.
I think Forrest Gump should be in everyone's top 10 Favorite movies of
all time. If you haven't seen Forrest Gump by now, I don't know what
your missing. This is one of Tom Hanks best. If you love Tom Hanks, and
you love drama. See FORREST GUMP. One of the best movies in the whole
wide world.<br /><br />*ANTHONY
