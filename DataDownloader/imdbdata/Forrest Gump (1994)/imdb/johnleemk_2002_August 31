This movies is one of the best made. It has it's flaws, but shines through
perfectly. There's not much else I can say since it's been stated here, but
this movie is not for everyone(especially those who can't stand drama and
comedy at the same time). For those who do like drama and comedy, give this
one a go. From that perspective, this movie deserves nothing less than
9/10.
