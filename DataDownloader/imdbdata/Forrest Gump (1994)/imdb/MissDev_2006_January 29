After seeing this film again, I realized that this is the reason we
watch movies. The reason we make movies. It is funny and hopeful and
sad and imaginative and truthful and everything that we look for in our
everyday lives, but aren't likely to find. With a Hollywood inundated
with unoriginal pieces of tripe - this film is a shining example of why
we still have faith in the art form. When this movie came out people
made a fuss about the 3-hour running time - but every minute is worth
it. Now 3 hours sees to be the norm for Hollywood &quot;blockbusters&quot; - but
what do we get for that? Special effects and weak scripts (with a few
notable exceptions). Take the time to watch this movie and savor the
innocence and pure fun that is this classic film.<br /><br />This is a film that everyone should watch at every different phase of
their lives - because it will mean a different thing each time you see
it.
