Marvelous movie!That&#x27;s all I can say.I only saw one performance of Tom
Hanks before,in The DaVinci Code,and I wasn&#x27;t extremely impressed.But
this performance...MY GOD!absolutely STUNNING!<br /><br />This movie totally deserves it&#x27;s Oscars.I was so fond of the movie and
of Hanks&#x27;s performance that I searched his speech at the moment of
receiving the academy award.Touching.This man has a huge talent.<br /><br />I also liked the fact that it didn&#x27;t show only the bad,or the good
stuff in Gump&#x27;s life.It combines drama and comedy in a unique way.<br /><br />I didn&#x27;t expect very much,because I don&#x27;t really enjoy &#x22;old&#x22;movies(I
consider a movie of the 90&#x27;s old).But this totally jumps off the page!<br /><br />BRAVO!A must see!
