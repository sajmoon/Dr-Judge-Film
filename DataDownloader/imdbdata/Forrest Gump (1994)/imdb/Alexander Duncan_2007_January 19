What can you expect from a director who only has experience with
Fiction movies? I knew Tom Hanks wouldn&#39;t say &quot;yes&quot; to just any script,
it had to be something above all. I was curious, so I went to the
theater the day it came out. After three hours in the cinema the film
finally came to an end. I was surprised by what I had seen. Normally
after a movie you remember the good scenes, the ones that made a really
deep impression on you. But this film was different. I could remember
all the scenes, even the really short ones. As a film reviewer that is
really important, and someone actually have to take notes during the
show. I believe &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;&#39;s screenplay is well written(even though
it&#39;s truly a story from a novel) and directed that it will make even
the most heartless man want to cry, sing, and dance. <br /><br />The story &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; faces many of todays society problems from a
different point view. Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks) is a retarded boy who
grows up in the state of Alabama with his single mother that always had
a way of explaining things that made him understand. Forrest was born
with soft bones, and was therefore forced to walk with steel tubes, one
on each side of his leg, all the way up to his knee. It had big
influence on him as a child, and you will recognize it later into his
life as well. These are some of the things they face; Racism, drug
abuse, war, killing as protest against politicians, love, and of course
retarded people.<br /><br />This is a &quot;must see!&quot;. I recommend &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; to everybody, it&#39;s a
movie you cant be without. Beautiful point of view, that I&#39;ve never
seen anything like. Well acted, incredibly good directed, and written
god like.
