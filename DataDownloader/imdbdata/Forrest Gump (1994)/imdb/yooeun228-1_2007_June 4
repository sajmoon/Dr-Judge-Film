Robert Zemeckis directed this movie, Forrest Gump, in 1994. It well
maintained the theme from the original version of book, &quot;Life is like a
box of chocolates&quot; and &quot;Stupid is as stupid does&quot; This movie contains a
lot of great actors and actresses who could act their own characters
very well and showed the theme or plot. The reason why this film became
so popular is because this story isn&#39;t just for the certain period or
certain people, but for everyone.<br /><br />The movie begins in the small fictional town in Alabama but soon; the
setting of this movie goes on to the whole world. The setting also
proves about the universal theme, &quot;Everyman&quot; All the important events
happen between late 1950s to late1980s. This movie doesn&#39;t only affects
about late 1950s to late1980s but the present time also. Such as white
trash and people who have physical problems didn&#39;t live only between
1950s to 1980s but they still exist.<br /><br />There are several characters that strongly affect the theme or the plot
of this movie. First of all, the surrealistic character, Forrest Gump
who was acted by Tom Hanks well represented the theme and also well
showed of physical problem of Forrest. His IQ was under 70 and he had a
problem with his legs when he was young. When he became an adult, he
was still prejudged by people based on his intelligence. However, later
he becomes really famous and rich. This event doesn&#39;t really mean to
show that Forrest Gump became a successful person, but the movie is
trying to break a strong stereotype of people, by using Forrest Gump.
Also, it is telling not to judge people&#39;s ability or characteristics by
intelligence or physical abilities. Like his quote &quot;stupid is as stupid
does.&quot; Mrs. Gump, Sally Fields, the actress was actor playing the
mother of Forrest shows the theme of strong determination of all
mothers in the world. Even though only ten year older than the grown
Forrest Gump, her acting was so realistic that the audience didn&#39;t
realize her age. Jenny, who was acted by Robin Wright, showed the
reality of dark side of Americans&#39; life. In the movie Jenny was the
&quot;white trash&quot; but she isn&#39;t the only who is showing the theme of
American life but partly, but through L.T he is somehow showing it too.
He&#39;s character was so realistic. A deep friendship is expressed through
his characterization.<br /><br />Generally, there are six most interesting events that are happening in
this movie. In my opinion, starting the movie by grown Forrest Gump
talking about his childhood from the present time on the bench is a
good idea. His first interesting event starts when he entered school.
He had a hard time. On the school bus everyone seemed to avoid him or
be as far away from him, only because of his physical appearance. But
later, Jenny who didn&#39;t look about her appearance came to him and be
friend. Other than this, there are three events that Forrest Gump
becoming all famous and meeting the U.S president three times. With
this event, the plot goes really high in audience interest and I&#39;m sure
that viewers loved these events. Lastly, there is one important event
left, about Jenny and Forrest that went audience very pleased but not a
real happy ending.<br /><br />I was very impressed with this movie, especially with the acting skills
and the themes of this story. This is a film that everyone would like
and feel empathy with all these characters. The plot also appeals to
average and ordinary people. I recommend this movie to all people no
matter how old they are.
