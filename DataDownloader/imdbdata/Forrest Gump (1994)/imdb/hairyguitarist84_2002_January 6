This truly is a special film. The fact that some people say it didnt
deserve
the awards it won just annoys me. some people say this film is too mushy,
it's not mushy, it's powerful and moving and carries messages about love
and
fate. While being a moving, emotion story Forrest Gump also manages to be
incredibly funny at times aswell. There aren't many films out there that
can
make you both laugh and cry, but this is one of the rare few. Zemeckis
does
a superb job directing as usual and all the parts are wonderfully cast
with
brilliant performances from the lead rolls. Alan Silvestri's music score
works well and suits the film perfectly.<br /><br />I struggle to find a bad word to say about this film, some would say that
it's stupidly unrealistic. Well yes, with all the things Forrest manages
to
achieve the film does seem a bit unrealistic. But i believe it's supposed
to
be that way to get across the messages of fate and the fact that one man,
no
matter how intelligent can make a difference and can lead a good life.<br /><br />Forrest Gump is a very enjoyable, well made film that everyone should see
at
some point. It stands as one of the best films of the 90s and thats why it
won awards.
