1998_December 10 

first of all, I've only seen this movie once, but I was actually very
offended by it.  It takes itself far too seriously.  The commentary embedded
in the film's core, relating to the 60s revolution and drug use in general,
are shockingly naive, reactionary, and simple-minded.  This movie likes to
think that if it can pass itself off as simple, it can pass of its truths as
&quot;simple truths&quot; much like its foggy-headed main character.  Not so.  It's
just simple, in a kind of idiotic way that makes us underestimate the
complexities of our social history (speaking as a 23 year old, what do I
know?, but I've been through a little bit) and come out with a shiny happy
90s answer to all these issues.  This movie is for people who voted for
Reagan.
