i believe that this is a great movie i grew up watching this movie i
could probably quote this movie by heart i loved this movie inspired me
to love movies i think this is one of the best movies i&#39;ve seen i lost
track of how many times i&#39;ve seen this movie i think this was tom
hank&#39;s best film with exception of Saving Private Ryan but still this
is great i think that even kids in this movie were great actors and
actresses i don&#39;t think that there is a better movie but it is a great
movie because it is combined with all types of movies thriller, comedy,
drama this movie is inspirational because it shows u that &quot;life is a
box of chocolates you never know what your gonna&#39; get&quot;
