I know alot of people disliked this movie, but not me. This is my favorite
movie. Forrest Gump is the most wonderful character, he doesn't know hate,
racism, or the rat race around him. All he knows is that he loves two
women,
his mother and Jenny. Forrest never settles, he waits endlessly for his
true
love Jenny. I do admit that the scenes where he was running and the
creation
of the bumper stickers and the have a nice day t-shirts were far fetched
but
the rest were great.
No one could have played Forrest better than the one man who I respect
most in Hollywood,Hanks. Know matter how many times I watch this movie, I
will cry and cry. I remember the first time I saw it and watched little
Haley joe Osment, I leaned over and told my husband that little boy is
going
to be a star. I was right! I can watch this movie over and over and still
have that same feeling I did when I first saw it!
