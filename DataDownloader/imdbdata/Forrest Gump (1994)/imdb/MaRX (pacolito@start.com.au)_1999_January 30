1999_January 30 

Well, this is a film, which sees, to be either LOVED or HATED.<br /><br />To me, this film appealed to me for it's story-line, and the way it is
&quot;different&quot; from other films. I also liked the fact that a lot &quot;happened&quot; in
the film.<br /><br />The idea of the film separates it from any other.<br /><br /> From childhood bullies to  The Vietnam War, this film is a real
pleaser.<br /><br />At times sad, funny, confusing, this trip through Forrest Gump's life is a
heart warming experience.<br /><br />Absolutely, &quot;Vundabar&quot;!<br /><br />
