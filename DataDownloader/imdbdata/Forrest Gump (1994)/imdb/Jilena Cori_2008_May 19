If Eric Roth looks at this -- would be honored to say thank you for
&quot;Forest Gump&quot;. I know several more remote and esoteric films, but every
time I see Forest Gump I come apart at the seams, more Kleenex each
time... and it&#39;s so worth it! Love is woven alongside tragedy it in a
way that makes me feel I&#39;m riding one big crane shot of life. Gump
strips down what it means to be human in such a pure and heartbreaking
way. I know film is a collaborative medium (and though I&#39;m pretty sure
Tom Hanks is our best bargaining chip for sparing the planet if we ever
have negotiate with hostile aliens, but his brilliance aside...) as a
screenwriter, I want to thank writers like Eric Roth and Winston Groom
for being the creating inception of a film so beautiful, it inspires
the rest of us -- especially me -- to keep aspiring to make something
good and to believe it&#39;s worth it to try.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Jilena Cori PS: Maybe I&#39;ll go blubber all over Tom Hanks&#39; message board
now... damn, outta Kleenex...
