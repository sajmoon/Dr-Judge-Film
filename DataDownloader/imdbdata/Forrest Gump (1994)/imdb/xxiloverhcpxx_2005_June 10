I adore this film.Hanks makes forest come to life as though,there is
forest out there right now. I love how it starts and ends at the bench
by the bus stop.This is a film that will make you both cry with
laughter and cry with tears. forest has to be most convincing character
ever made in film. Every time this film comes on TV i always watch
it.Its the most inspiring,loving and beautiful film ever made about one
American mans life.I don't every think that any one else could take on
the role of forest other than Tom Hanks.for anyone who has not seen the
film,i would recommend that you go out and rent it from the video/DVD
shop now.
