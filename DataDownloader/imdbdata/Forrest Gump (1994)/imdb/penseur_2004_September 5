&quot;How do we provide a US history lesson, warts and all, that is both
entertaining and sentimental?&quot; may have been the question the script
writers/producers asked themselves and settled on a slightly mentally
and physically retarded boy in (of course) bigoted Alabama who just
happens to later be present in most of the momentous occasions in US
history of the second half of the 20th century. Well he doesn't stay
physically retarded for very long, quite the opposite. We get to see to
see quite a few American icons (OK, John Lennon was English, but like
some of the other notable people we see he got assassinated by a mad
gunman.) The film manages to maintain a didactically neutral attitude
towards the events and people it shows - the facts alone - but is heavy
on sentimentality, which no doubt is good for box office takings. Inane
it certainly is, but has excellent set design and cinematography, has
good flow, and great songs on the soundtrack. Worth watching. 8/10
