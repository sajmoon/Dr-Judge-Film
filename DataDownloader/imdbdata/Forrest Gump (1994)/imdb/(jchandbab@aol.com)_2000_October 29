It is very easy to be cynical about this movie. Totally implausible? Yep.
Over sentimental? Without  doubt.  Overrated?
Of course.  But through all these things that you could that would make
this
sound like an awful movie, there is one thing that you cannot deny.  This
movie moved people.  Told from the naive and Simple-minded Gump, it trawls
through Vietnam, the US Hippy Age, and numerous events at the Whitehouse,
showing that Gump has had a far more interesting life  than he would ever
let on.  It is essentially a love story, as he continues in his mission to
win over his childhood sweet heart.  It is told completely in flash back
until the last few minutes, and as a brilliant Tom Hanks unravels the
story
for his audience, delivering line after line of unknowing yet amazingly
poignant statements, you sort of realise just how good it was to be
totally
ignorant things.  Maybe this movie was not as great as everyone said it
was.
In realisation, it did not deserve the heap of Oscars it got.  But for
two
hours, this innocent guy reminded us what it was like to be youthful in
mind, totally free of cynicism. And I for one, have got no problem
whatsoever with that. *****
