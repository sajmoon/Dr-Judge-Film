forrest gump is exactly the reason why every time movie audiences
around the world go to watch the movies in theater, to be captivated by
range of spellbinding emotions through the movies characters no matter
the real or fiction it should be movie magic. And what some of the most
intelligent characters to hit the silver screen could'not do or provide
for years this local idiot gave it all in two and a half hours time
span. Forrest gump is a person who is a work of a fiction and this
biofiction will take u to the course of some of American histories most
important and noted event through this fictional person without even
letting u feel that this as all fake and sometime makes us feel he
really is for real and may be alive in alabama's greenbow county.this
movie is for everyone to watch. I feel also that the reason everyone
loved the America through the eyes of the forrest gump and also forrest
gump himself is because of the innocence of the character and of his
innocent way of viewing the history of America which through our eyes
world over does not look anything near to innocent.
