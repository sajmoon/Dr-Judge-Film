Forrest Gump is one of the best movie of the 90's, at least I think so.
Forrest Gump's story is exciting and funny, the way it is presented by
a not so clever man (Forrest Gump) is genial, and Tom Hanks is
marvelous. The role fits him perfectly. But of course, Robin Wright
Penn, Gary Sinise and Sally Field are also good. This movie deserves
all the awards it has taken, maybe even more. Forrest Gump's specific
lines: &quot;Stupid is who stupid does&quot;, &quot;My mom always said...&quot;, &quot;Life is
like A Box of chocolates. You never know what you're going to get.&quot;
make the movie better. Gump's happenings - first he was able to walk,
then he played rugby, then he got medals for his activity in the army,
he was a table-tennis champion, became a millionaire and ran for 3
years - are fantastic. The script is fantastic, the actors are
fantastic... The movie is FANTASTIC!!!
