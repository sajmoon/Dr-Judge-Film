The craftsmanship in this movie is not that it has a good message, it&#39;s
that it tells a good story and the good messages keep coming. These
messages are so universal, it would be difficult to find someone who
can watch this film without shedding a tear.<br /><br />Forrest Gump is a none-too-bright Southerner whose positive attitude,
uncomplicated life, and honest application of hard work yield for him a
soap-opera-like chain of incredible success. Instead of achieving one
historically significant and newsworthy goal, he achieves every major
definition of success in Western Culture, except for the one he wants:
the love of &quot;his girl&quot;, Jenny. While he is off winning high honors,
getting photographed on both television and magazines, Jenny leads the
life of The Prodigal; boozing it up and partying down. It&#39;s always
empty and disappointing to her.<br /><br />For all his colossal successes, Forrest himself winds up unsure of
himself because he knows he his not smart. The mutual dissatisfactions
of incredible success and incredible failure with no one to share it
with lead the two back together for a familiar friendship. An
interesting resolution to the story fulfills the &quot;what&#39;s missing&quot; in
each of their lives.<br /><br />Wall-to-wall solid performances. Tightly cut together. Incredible
special effects. Rich art direction for the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s flashbacks.
Especially keep an eye out for all the TVs, the iconic talisman of the
film. Most appropriate/appreciated by 15 years old and up.
