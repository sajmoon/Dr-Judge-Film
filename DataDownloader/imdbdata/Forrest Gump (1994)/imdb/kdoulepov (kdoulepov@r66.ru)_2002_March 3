Best Story.
Usual theme. Interesting actors. Good soundtrack.
If you think of film look Titanic. If you like history and personal bias -
in great detail you should see Gump and silently get into the world of
happiness, big resolutions, XX century wind of changes.
Look  - just be a patient audience and he show you .. nothing. May be you
might look into the your own life or maybe you just need to tell your story
or just take carefully the letter or postcard from someone.
Keep it simple. Buy only good chocolate.
