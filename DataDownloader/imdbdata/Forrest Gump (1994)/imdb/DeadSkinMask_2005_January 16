I just watched Forrest Gump tonight for the first time in a long time.
It is one of the saddest movies ever.<br /><br />It's just an amazing movie, and its power comes from the titular
character. What makes it so powerful is that Forrest has little
comprehension of just how lucky he is. Being as &quot;slow&quot; as he is, he has
no need for, or probably has never felt complex human emotion.
Everything he feels is simple but true, which makes his journey so
touching.<br /><br />Watching this movie will have an effect on you; it'll make you assess
your station in life and maybe it'll push you to define yourself and
your role in existence.<br /><br />Definitely see this if you haven't yet. And bring some Kleenex.
