Life is a box of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get.
This
movie is the same thing, a box of chocolates, and a very sweet and
touching
one. This movie was a surprise from beginning to end. Some parts were full
of action and suspense, others were full of laughs and hilarious
situations,
others are full of tears and are very heart warming. The story is all
about
a guy with a low I.Q.(but a big heart, if you do not mind my saying so)
survives through history in the United States. It is a very sweet movie,
and
this Forrest is a very sweet character, and I like that he is played by
Tom
Hanks. This movie is a Wonderfully Delicious Box of Chocolates.10/10.
