I think this movie made Tom Hanks worth the 25 million. I mean this movie
makes him the number one guy in Hollywood. Its a good film directed nicely
with some good effects but the whole movie is Hanks over the top
performance. I mean its not the best and i dont think it deserved all the
awards but it was a very good movie. They need a new category for Pulp
Fiction.
