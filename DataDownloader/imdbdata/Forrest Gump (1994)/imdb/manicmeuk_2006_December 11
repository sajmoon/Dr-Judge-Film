hm I&#39;m a little shocked at the level of hatred for this film. I&#39;ve seen
it at least half a dozen times, and every time i cannot help but be
touched.<br /><br />i think a lot of people are taking it far too seriously.<br /><br />i don&#39;t think this film is about all the events featured in it, its not
about the moral implications of war, about the right and wrong way to
live life, i don&#39;t even think its all that much about the &quot;american
dream&quot; this film is about the way a simple minded innocent man LIVES
through these experiences, its about his VIEWS on life.<br /><br />i think its really sad that people can watch this film and completely
miss what makes it so moving. if u watch this film as a walk-through of
the life of an extremely likable character, if u see it as he sees
things, you will undoubtedly enjoy this movie experience. if your going
to watch it to pick faults in the personality and views presented then
you will undoubtedly find a lot to complain about.<br /><br />its a story about how one individual handles the situations that life
throws at him. it is what makes this film so charming.
