There is too much to be said about these masterpiece. It&#x27;s very deep,
sad and funny, it&#x27;s pure life with many aspects and problems described
very deeply and using beautiful and artistically perfect scenes(i.e.
the questions of family abuse and racism (violence) in the world - in
the scene at Black Panther party, when they talk about stopping any
violence in the country, and their chief beats up Jenny at the same
time). I cannot even count all powerful scenes of the movie(it MUST be
watched several times to get all of them(for me at least:). But
together with numerous genius scenes, it&#x27;s really amazing how the
simple truths in life are touching me in this movie. Like when Forrest
admires the beauty of nature, saves his friends, happy about meeting
old friend, full of emotions meeting his son, cries when loosing his
closest people - there is nothing new about such scenes. But I believe
and share his emotions, because he is true and honest.
