I'm about to publish a book, called the Bubba Book of Knowledge. One of
my quests has been to travel to take photographs of famous movie
scenes. I've lived in Savannah since 1983 and was thrilled that Gump
was filmed in and around my town. The bench was in downtown Savannah.
The Gump House is near Beaufort. The tree they sat in is near the
entrance to the Beaufort Marine Base. The bridge that Jenny almost
jumped from has been torn down, but was the Kings Ferry Bridge near
Richmond Hill, Georgia. Love's Seafood had a temporary &quot;Girls, Girls,
Girls&quot; neon sign on their restaurant, next to the bridge. Gump was
running in front of the houses on West Bay Street in Savannah. I spent
a night across the street from the Santa Monica Pier, where he ran to
the end and stopped. The grate the young Gump caught his foot in was in
Ridgeland, South Carolina. <br /><br />It's such a thrill to recapture the scenes. It's amazing that this
movie has continued to be one of my favorites. It was set in the times
of my same age groups and so much of the memories come flooding back.<br /><br />Thom Brooks Brooks Insurance School, SABL Baseball Savannah, Georgia
