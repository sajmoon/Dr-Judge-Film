Forrest Gump is a very good movie. It is very appropriate for this
movie to win 6 Oscars including Best Picture. The story is about a
special person who tells the story of his life while sitting on a bus
bench(for most of the time). He talks about his childhood, his first
friend and lover, Jenny, Vietnam, and more about Jenny. I liked the
romance in the film. Usuallt, I don&#39;t like romance but this kind of
romance kept me involved in the movie. The acting is good. I liked Tom
Hank&#39;s southern accent. I liked the music in the film. The score is
nice to listen to and the songs are instant classics. I believe that
some people don&#39;t like this movie because it seems very political with
all the references to the President. Overall, this is a very good,
inspiring film. I rate this movie 10/10.
