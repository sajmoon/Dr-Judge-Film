Whether you see this at face value as a loving look at a &quot;slow&quot; guy who
makes good or as a comment on American, it still adds up to &quot;Americans are
simple in the head&quot;. Boy do they love a film that reflects this very
wholesome American love of the &quot;common&quot; dullard. Forrest would actually be
teased if not killed for being this dumb in the deep south but add a
soundtrack of hits, catch phases, and Tom Hanks' bad 'tard impression and a
tear jerker is born. Duh, ignorance is bliss.
