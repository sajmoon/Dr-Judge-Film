Every once in a while, something comes along that hasn&#39;t been done
before. This movie is one of those things. First of all, we have a
principal character whose take on life is one where you don&#39;t judge it;
you live it. I know he&#39;s a film character. It doesn&#39;t matter because we
use images such as these to inspire us and to give us our own way of
treating each day. Forrest lets no grass grow under his feet. He is the
consummate optimist. He doesn&#39;t complain because he sees early on that
it does you no good. His life is one adventure after another, in and
out of the public eye, but his shyness and demeanor don&#39;t ever get to
his head. He is the epitome of patience, something sadly lacking in the
lives of most Americans. He is pushed around by the gusts of time and
always lands on his feet. His relationship with a troubled girl is the
one consistent thing in his life, and that is also shows his
pugnaciousness. There are some commentators and reviewers who call this
character stupid. He is a slow processor, but his stability lies in his
morality and his consistency. His mother raised him well.<br /><br />Tom Hanks has become our new Jimmy Stewart. His roles are about human
emotion and dedication. He is the everyman in many ways. Obviously, the
subject matter has changed, but you can bank on his decision making
when it comes to film. <br /><br />The other heroes are the special effects people. They are able to make
this work; to create an incredible world for him to function within.
The news clips are quite marvelous. I usually put this film in my top
ten.
