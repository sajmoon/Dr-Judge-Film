I&#x27;ve always liked the movie Forrest Gump ever since I was a little kid.
It&#x27;s a real classic and Tom Hanks just does a fantastic job as Forrest
Gump. In the movie a man named Forrest Gump while waiting for a bus in
Savannah Georgia tells his life story of growing up in Greenbow Alabama
and playing football for the University of Alabama and then going into
the army and fighting in Vietnam and then starting his own successful
shrimping business and then fighting for the love of his life Jenny
Curren and running across America. My favorite character in the movie
was Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise)and I liked it when he asked Forrest if he
found Jesus and Forrest said I didn&#x27;t know I was suppose to be looking
for him sir! That was so hilarious that I almost died laughing! Forrest
Gump is a true classic movie that&#x27;ll go on forever and ever! It&#x27;s my
favorite Tom Hanks film along with Cast Away! 10 out of 10!
