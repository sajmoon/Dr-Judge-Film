Forrest Gump directed by Robert Zemechis is a truly remarkable movie
for me.This movie has shades of memories of my life &#x26; it has touched me
emotionally in many ways.The acting of Tom Hanks is triumphant.I have
never seen a better act from him &#x26; the truth is i don&#x27;t want to.Scenes
like Forrest having polio &#x26; with just few words of Jenny does the magic
&#x26; he is able to run.Thats so beautiful.Scene of Forrest &#x26; Jenny meeting
on the sea shore where everyone claps are just some amazing scenes you
will ever come across.The agony of Lieutenant Dan is very
amazing.Eventually movie concludes with a sad ending &#x26; the soundtrack
is memorable.It shows the truth of life,you can get whatever you need
in your life but still you wont get that one thing that you always
want.Superb direction &#x26; brilliant acting with a touching story just
makes the day for the audience.Forrest&#x27;s mother reminded me of my own
mother.This is an emotional experience for me as i had past of my
parents related with polio,my love for the army once,as well as those
romantic meets that i always want.This is triumphant.In short,verdict
is if you don&#x27;t see this for your emotional conscience just see it for
the brilliance of Tom Hanks.Forrest Gump is emotionally triumphant for
me.
