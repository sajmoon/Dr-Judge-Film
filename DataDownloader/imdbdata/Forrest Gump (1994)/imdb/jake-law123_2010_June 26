This film touched me more than any other film has touched me. Tom
Hanks, my favorite actor of all time, gives his greatest performance
ever, and Robert Zemeckis, one of the my all time favorite directors,
gives his best directing work ever, even better than the Back to the
Future series.<br /><br />Its got a terrific story, with lovable characters, a great cast, and
many other elements to a flawless film. From the moment I started
watching this film, all the way to the end, I immediately fell in love
with it, and after seeing it over and over and over again, I realized I
couldn&#x27;t get tired of it, and it is now my favorite film of all.<br /><br />Based off the novel by Winston Groom, Forrest Gump tells the story of a
simple minded, and mentally challenged man whose life is a string of
fate that flows like a feather. Throughout his life, he becomes
involved with some of the most historical moments of the 20th century,
such as the Vietnam war, the championship ping pong tour, and the
assassination of president Kennedy. But somehow, he also &#x22;accidently&#x22;
wines up in more ridiculous moments, as he witnesses the Watergate
robbery, apparently taught Elvis his moves, and met three different
presidents. He also becomes a shrimp boat captain, as well as a ping
pong champ, but as successful as he is, his only demeanor in life is to
be with his lifelong friend, Jenny, and his loving mamma. He also meets
other friends in his life, such as Bubba, who becomes his friend during
the war, and Lieutenant Dan, who was his Lieutenant in the war, but
remains his friend, as he becomes paralyzed during an enemy ambush, but
blames Forrest for saving him instead of letting him die in the field
with honor, but as Lieutenant Dan becomes a better person, he starts to
thank Forrest.<br /><br />A truly emotional and fateful film that tells you that anything can
happen in life, whether its luck, fate, or coincidence. And it also
shows how Forrest becomes the one meaning and true person in the lives
of everybody he meets. Although not all of it is true, the idea is
clever, and works great in the film. The best screenplay ever!!!<br /><br />Tom Hank&#x27;s performance is flawless, as well as Robin Wright Penn, as
Jenny, Gary Sinise, as Lieutenant Dan, and Sally Field, as mamma.<br /><br />A film that touches me every time I see it, and every time I do, it
gives me a happy feeling in life that anything can happen, which is
what makes this my #1 favorite film of all time.
