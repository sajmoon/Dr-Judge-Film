Not because it is the best movie ever , I cannot define such , its
simply so full of American flavors and humor that you cannot resist to
watch it once, twice, many times over and still discover details,
jokes, lines, symbols, history, music, all these things typical and
amusing. First you have a brilliant sense of humor, well sometimes
rough around the edges but still like a diamond shine. Second - so many
historically important events and stories, scenery, heroes, etc. that I
really enjoyed it. Third - the music is really good, also typical and
fit to the scenes and moments in the movie. Fourth... I am tired of
discussing but I would like to say just go ahead and watch this,
especially if you are European tired of American movies, Americans
really can make a good laugh movie implanted with very deep thinking
and brilliant allusions. Oh I almost forgot the acting of Tom Hanks is
quite perfect!
