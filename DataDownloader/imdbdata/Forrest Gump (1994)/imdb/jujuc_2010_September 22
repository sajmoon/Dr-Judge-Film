Now, im not gonna spoil anything, although im presuming most of you
have seen the movie by now. When i first saw this movie i didn&#x27;t really
have any expectations because i didn&#x27;t know anything about it. It
simply blew me away though. The characters lives representing the
liberal and conservative side of America throughout the 20th century.<br /><br />Everyone can enjoy this movie. Its so amazing in its simplicity which
combines beautifully with just how amazing this movie is. The acting is
great and so is the plot and the dialouge. Hands down one of the best
movies of the 90&#x27;s.<br /><br />My rating: 9.7/10
