This awesome movie is about an innocent man who represents how the
world should be: he&#x27;s loyal, humble, honest, he would never cheat or
lie. He does everything with good heart and reaches success at the most
important tasks of life.<br /><br />Only in America he could live such an interesting life: meet Elvis
Presley, President Kennedy, John Lennon... He goes to Vietnam&#x27;s war and
he does everything following his heart. He becomes an American hero. <br /><br />Gary Sinise is a great American actor in his best performance too. He
served in Vietnam with Forrest and was also a hero, protecting his men
and fighting for his country.<br /><br />All in all this is a must-see movie for everyone, specially for
non-Americans, so we can enjoy American culture and icons, as well as
learn some American history, which is very useful.
