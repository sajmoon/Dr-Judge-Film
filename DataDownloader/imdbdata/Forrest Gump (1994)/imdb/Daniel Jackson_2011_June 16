Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump, a man regarded by most in the community
as having a below average IQ, who experiences many magnificent things
throughout his life. His journey takes him across the globe
experiencing many historically significant events along the way.
Throughout this journey full of accomplishments Forrest far surpasses
the expectations that many of his critics had for him. Although his
life, as full of successes as it was there was one thing that eluded
him, his true love, Jenny. Jenny, played by Robin Wright, was Forrest&#x27;s
lifelong friend and loved interest in the film. &#x22;Forrest Gump&#x22; is the
story of a man, who despite the many obstacles&#x27; and road blocks in his
live rises above these challenges and proves that a man&#x27;s willpower,
persistence, strength, and love are more important than any God given
abilities in life. Forrest attends and graduates college on a football
scholarship, enlists in the army, serves in Vietnam, meets numerous
presidents, successfully runs a shrimp boat business, becomes a husband
as well as a father. Throughout his story Forrest teaches us many
lasting life lessons.<br /><br />&#x22;Forrest Gump&#x22; demonstrates that doesn&#x27;t matter if you are different.
It doesn&#x27;t matter if you have a handicap. You can decide how to deal
with it. Every human being is worth exactly the same, and even if you
are in a position of disadvantage you don&#x27;t have to be depressed. All
that you need is the will to look at the bright side of life. All you
need is the feeling for true love, friendship and the determination to
make yourself and others happy. At times in our life we will realize
that things will happen to us that are out of control, but the most
important thing is to remember that they way we react to these things
is in our control. Intelligence isn&#x27;t the most important attribute in
life. The truly important values are happiness, friendship, love,
courage and freedom. The film Forrest Gump proves that our lives are a
combination of destiny and floating through life like a feather in the
breeze.<br /><br />The film &#x22;Forrest Gump&#x22; is very similar to the film &#x22;Benjamin Button.&#x22;
Both of these movies involve characters, Forrest and Benjamin, who are
faced with, and overcome the unique challenges in their lives. Forrest
is mentally slower than most average people are, but he proves that
determination and perseverance are just as valuable in life, and with
the refusal to give up, anything is possible. Benjamin Button, played
by Brad Pitt, encounters his own unique setbacks in his life. He is
born with a disorder that makes him age backwards. He&#x27;s born as a
wrinkly baby who is aged as if he were in his 80&#x27;s. As he gets older
his age makes him appear younger. Although this may seem like a big
setback for some Benjamin preservers throughout his life and
accomplishes many incredible feats just as Forrest did in &#x22;Forrest
Gump.&#x22;<br /><br />The special effects in the film &#x22;Forrest Gump&#x22; help demonstrate the
theme of the movie. A perfect example of how the special effects
support the theme of this movie is that Lt. Dan, who is injured in
Vietnam, is portrayed throughout the movie as having no legs. In all
actuality the actor playing Lt. Dan does have his legs throughout the
film. The use of computer generated imaging helps the audience see Lt.
Dan throughout the movie after Vietnam with no legs. Lt. Dan, although
very depressed early on after his injury overcomes his new fate and
becomes a successful, functioning member of society and even gets fake
legs in the end of the movie. It is obvious through Lt. Dan, much like
Forrest, that in life it doesn&#x27;t matter if you are different than
everyone else, what matters is what you make of your life. You may be
drifting through life in a breeze but with some good decisions and a
little destiny everything can work out in the end.<br /><br />Symbolism is another element that helped contribute to the theme of
Forrest Gump. The white feather that is present in both the beginning
and end of the film is representative of numerous characters in the
movie. Each character is floating through life &#x22;accidental like on a
breeze.&#x22; Forrest is most representative of this. After briefly learning
of his character, it would never be expected of him to accomplish the
things he does in his life. It seems that his fate is almost
&#x22;accidental like.&#x22; Forrest never really planned his life out, things
just kept falling into place for him. The symbolism of the feather is
also indicative of Jenny&#x27;s character in the film as well. Jenny drifts
through life, most of the time struggling, never trusting herself or
anyone else around her. She drifts through phase to phase in her life,
but in the end, like destiny, she ends up back with Forrest.<br /><br />Even though Forrest has some disadvantages in his life, he doesn&#x27;t let
these hold him back. He lives his life like the feather in the wind
that is present in both the beginning and the end of the film. Forrest
goes through life wondering what will happen next for him, longing for
Jenny&#x27;s love, but letting the winds of his life guide him throughout
his journeys. And in the end, like destiny, Forrest and Jenny get to be
married together and start a family.
