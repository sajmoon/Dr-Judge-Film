The tag line says it all: &quot;The world will never be the same once you&#39;ve
seen it through the eyes of Forrest Gump.&quot; I certainly cannot see the
world the same after watching such a brilliant movie. I learned a lot
about people, life, and the world. How many times can you say a film
has done that for you? The truth is, there is a little Forrest Gump in
all of us. Being able to see a character that represents everyone as
they learn their place in the world is an amazing concept.<br /><br />I&#39;ve always been a fan of Robert Zemeckis, and Tom Hanks delivers a
stunning performance once again. This one is a must see. Watch it, and
you&#39;ll learn something about yourself.
