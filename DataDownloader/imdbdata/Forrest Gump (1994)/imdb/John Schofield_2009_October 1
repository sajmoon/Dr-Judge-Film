I have only seen this film once but once was enough for me. This film
is a simple tale of goodness and light and how somebody can shine that
light on those less fortunate. Religion is not involved here at least
not in the conventional sense. The light is the sheer goodness of a
person who clearly cannot do or say anything to offend anybody no
matter how hard some people disrespect or try to offend them. In the
case of the man in the title role this is not an attitude that he
adopts to win favour or even artificial posturing in order to be
popular, it is who he is. There are people out there who will feed on
the mans positivity or goodness and hope by association to be renewed
or to have some beneficial effect rub off on them. And so Forrest goes
through life as if the world holds no surprises or perhaps everything
is a surprise, so when they come along he just adapts without any fuss
and just moves on. People like Forrest are rare indeed and the film
which charts his life is uncomplicated and just lays it out for all to
see. The entire cast and crew are to be congratulated on a very good
job as the film in the wrong hands could have been a disaster. I would
highly recommend anybody watch this film at least once, because for me
it has a very simple message and is also very entertaining.
