Forrest Gump has many messages.Some of which are less apparent than
others.But the most outstanding message is an advice not to give up on
life.This is said by comparing Forrest's life with the lives of those
around
him.Another important message is that time heals all wounds and we see
that
how the passage of time brings cheer to even the most rankled hearts.&quot;Life
is like a box of chocolates.You never know what you're gonna get.&quot;and
another refreshing sentence &quot;My momma always said:You got to put the past
behind you before you can move on.&quot;.Yes,life is too short,so always try to
be a strong and compassionate person and don't be afraid of falling in
love
because love gives you an extraordinary power.It's what he is trying to
teach us.
