This has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. Despite the best
efforts of the actors, most of whom are very talented, the ridiculous and
corny plot makes this a real chore to watch.<br /><br />You get the feeling that the director was trying to make a modern &quot;Homer's
Odyssey&quot;, but ended up instead with &quot;Homer Simpson's Odyssey&quot; - sans
laughs.
This movie offers lowest common denominator entertainment: patronization
to
those with learning difficulties, a twisted view on history, naive
jingoism,
and a nauseatingly contrived ending.<br /><br />When I first saw this movie I began wondering whether I was being too
harsh
on it. However, after talking to between fifteen and twenty other people,
I've come to the conclusion that I was being quite fair. None of those
I've
spoken to liked this film.<br /><br />If you like bubble-gum then you will probably like Forrest Gump. If
however,
you like movies with some semblance of intelligence or real entertainment
you will probably be disappointed by this movie.
