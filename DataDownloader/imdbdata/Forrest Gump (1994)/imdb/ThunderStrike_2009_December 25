I lost count of the number of times i watched this movie. It must have
been a dozen times at least. However, every time i&#x27;m viewing this
movie, it&#x27;s like seeing it for the first time. It&#x27;s still as brilliant,
cheerful and emotional without losing any of its glance or beauty, and
the story stays as powerful as it truly is and keeps you interested
till the end. Seeing it for just a few seconds makes you stick to the
screen till the end-music stops. The dialogues are perfect, the timing
is as a swiss watch, the story-twists are more than one could imagine,
and the setting in the enduring storyline of the 60&#x27;s, 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s of
last century, placing the movie inside the main events of that era,
just gives you the idea that this almost could be a real-life story. It
at least makes me wish it really was.<br /><br />If there should be a best-movie-ever, i think this movie should be it.
It would have my vote at least. Forget the Godfather, LOTR or Star
Wars, this truly is a movie that you&#x27;ll never forget.
