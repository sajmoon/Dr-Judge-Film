This is the kind of movie I love. Forrest Gump is a movie with a great
story, a cast of entertaining actors, a powerful score, as well as an
interesting take on history. The movie didn&#39;t seem to have a single
dull moment. From the start to the very end Forrest Gump captured your
heart and wouldn&#39;t let go. The movie was also very well done. It
rightfully earned all 6 of the Oscars that it won. The only weak aspect
of film making I noticed was some of the editing. Some of the scenes
didn&#39;t flow as well as they should have, I don&#39;t know if this was the
editor&#39;s fault or if there just wasn&#39;t the right footage to work with.
That however is easily over looked due to the quality of the rest of
the film making. I would recommend this movie.
