Tom Hanks (Saving Private Ryan) stars as Forrest Gump, a man who sits
on a bench and recalls his life story, growing up with many
difficulties and challenges.<br /><br />Hanks gives possibly the best performance of his career as the troubled
man with many issues in his life. Definitely an Oscar winning
performance with brilliant timing, execution, humour and seriousness
all brilliantly established by the cast away star.<br /><br />The plot is brilliantly character driven with a strong focus upon
serious issues and how Gump deals with them such as his intelligence,
his independence and relationship with other people. The issues are
beautifully dealt with and shown with such a strong emotion, especially
towards the end which is a very dramatic moment in the film and one of
the saddest moments in film history I believe.<br /><br />A film is always strong if it gives width and depth to other characters
as well and the emotion behind Lt Dan&#39;s (Gary Sinise) story is
remarkable and a powerful signifier of realism and honour in army life.
Gump&#39;s best friend in the army Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) also has a
story to tell about his upbringing and the honour and tradition of his
family&#39;s shrimp business. Jenny (Robin Wright Penn) also has a dramatic
and emotional life and has many issues to contend with and her story is
one of the most intriguing for me.<br /><br />The plot is consistent with strong realism and a powerful meaning
behind each issue.<br /><br />The film is well recognized as a comedy drama and through the issues
covers drama and with the memorable quotes comes a great combination of
the two genres. From &quot;Life is like a box of chocolates&quot; to &quot;stupid is
as stupid does&quot; Zemeckis&#39; film proves successful on all levels.<br /><br />The direction and settings are brilliant, especially during the running
scenes. The whole ideology of ping pong was brilliant as was the film
in general and one of the best comedy dramas of the 90&#39;s if not of all
time.
