FORREST GUMP is among the greatest movies of all time.  It's a kind of movie
that grows on you and never wants to let go.  Tom Hanks is at his best
playing a Southern boy whose life is affected by many various moments of
U.S. history.  Robin Wright provides a cute love interest in a movie that
never gets tedious or boring.  FORREST GUMP definitely stands the test of
time and is still enjoyable to watch to this day.  A cinematic
masterpiece.<br /><br />5 out of 5
