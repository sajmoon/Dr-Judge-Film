Easily, this movie goes down as one of my all time favourites.  I have seen
it at least a dozen times and it never fails to touch me and bring tears to
my eyes.  <br /><br />Gump was pure perfection from beginning to end.  A movie sure to refresh
your outlook on life and replenish your energy and spirit.  A story of a
simple man's triumph over life's obstacles in his quest for his true love. <br /><br />Tom Hanks gives the best performance of his career, surpassing his first
Oscar winning performance in Philadelphia.  The entire cast turns in
brilliant portrayals of their own, from Robin Wright to Sally Field, with
several &quot;scene stealers&quot; from the talented Gary Sinise. <br /><br />Eric Roth's screenplay (based on the novel) was nothing short of genius and
it kept you riveted to the screen as the story unfolded, waiting to see the
next chapter in Forrest's unbelievable life.  Even after countless viewings,
I am still mesmerized. <br /><br />Through the wonders of special effects, the life of Forrest Gump is
intertwined with a string of historical events resulting in a poignant
journey of life through one man's eyes.  Through all that happens to him he
never loses sight of the one thing that is missing from his life - his
Jenny.  His love for her is the backbone of this movie and is one of the
most moving love stories I have seen on the big screen to date. <br /><br />All in all, the Best Picture Oscar was more than deserved.  While its
competitors were all excellent movies in their own right, Forrest Gump
offers a complete movie going experience - romance, action, comedy, history,
brilliant direction, a unique screenplay and outstanding performances. What
more could you possibly ask for?  <br /><br />A refreshing piece of film-making genius that is sure to become a classic in
years to come.
