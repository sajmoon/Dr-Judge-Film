so seriously- I do not rate movies leniently. Though having said this,
I have just gone and given my first 10 rating. However Forrest Gump is
truly deserving of such a high rating as not only does it clarify the
situation of life and the speed at which it moves- it also keeps you
enchanted throughout. Man seriously this movie is the kinda film you
can watch alone, with your friends, family or special love; the effect
will always be magical. From beginning to end this film is pure class,
with great acting contributions mixed with a truly special storyline!
So you can imagine the result is one of the greatest films of all time-
well worth the watch. Okay if you haven&#39;t seen this film..........watch
it!!!
