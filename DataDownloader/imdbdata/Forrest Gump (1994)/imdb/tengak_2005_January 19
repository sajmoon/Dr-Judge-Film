Despite the comedy, it touches the heart. You laugh and you cry. The
world and political time it portraits, one can easily relate to. The
special effects introduced were also ground breaking. You are taken on
a fast paced emotional ride. The tears come from the way the movie
drags you on this journey back and forth through utmost joy and bitter
sadness in an unrelenting way. It is a love story, a war story, a story
about friendship and family. It is about the dismal side and the
ultimate triumph of the human spirit. It teaches us also to laugh at
our situation, no matter what. A lovely picture that will endure for
sure.
