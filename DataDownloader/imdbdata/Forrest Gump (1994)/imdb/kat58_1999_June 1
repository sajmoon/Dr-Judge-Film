I love this movie! so it's a little corny. It's rare to find funny and
innocent anymore. Tom Hanks was really good. and I loved Bubba, Jenny,
Dan,
and the rest.  We even named our cat Jenny (pronounced Jen-nay).  I read
the
book 1st - and it was different.  worth reading. too bad Winston Groom
didn't make the money Tom Hanks did!  I love the &quot;historic&quot; scenes - like
when Forrest met the president.  and the part about Elvis is a hoot!  The
amputee scene is ground-breaking technology, as is the mall in DC.  Love
it,
own it, thanks!
