It&#39;s a peculiar film, Forrest Gump. You can hardly imagine the pitch:
&#39;wholesome but mentally challenged John Doe takes us on a journey
through contemporary American history as its unsung hero&#39;. Of course
this is precisely the character that appeals not only to The People but
specifically to The American People. Hanks&#39;s Gump occupies the
unassailable American moral ground of being unswervingly obedient to
his mother and her blend of Christian and homespun philosophy.<br /><br />I enjoyed Forrest Gump. I thought it was a funny, honest fantasy. Hanks
has his d&ouml;ppeltrump out for all to see, switching between goofy and
opaquely, intensely serious. Gary Sinise sneers effectively by his side
throughout and Sally Field is discreet but affecting as his mother.
Contrived, but by no means facile or patronising. 6/10
