This is a very good film with good performances and great direction. It
did
win a few Academy Awards including the Big ONE! But it went up against
Pulp
Fiction and Shawshank Redemption. I have seen all three of these films
many
times but I think that Pulp Fiction should have one but it was propbably a
little too original for most viewers. If not Pulp, I would have chosen
Shawshank to win. At least for adapted screenplay? The film still is very
well done and I think Zemeckis did an amazing job. Tarantino did deserve
the
Oscar though, but Zemeckis showed each era truthfully from what I have
read
and heard about. I have also heard that Terry Gilliam turned the film down
and that was probably a very good thing. Don't get me wrong, he is a very
good director but he would have ruined this movie. Overall, the film is
very
good, I would give it 8/10.
