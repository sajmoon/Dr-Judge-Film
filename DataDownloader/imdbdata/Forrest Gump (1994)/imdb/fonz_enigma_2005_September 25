Move over godfather. Forrest Gump is the greatest movie ever. Its a
brilliant movie.No words can describe the movie.Tom Hanks is
outstanding. I have seen it over 7 times. I cant help crying when tom
visits Jennys grave in the end. i always love to hate Robin because he
loves her so much nd she is so screwed up to marry him nd live happily
ever after. tom hanks rules .I keep wondering that robin wright
probably dies of AIDS because she is on drugs and keeps having sex with
every tom , dick and harry. So probably even Haley Joel Osment has AIDS
and then he will die later. So our man tom will be sad again. I need a
better ending. I just love the movie. Even my cousin Ebu loves the
movie. You who has not seen the great movie yet, you are definitely
missing a magnum opus.
