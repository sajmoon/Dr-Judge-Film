(0 stars preferably)<br /><br />I must be the only one who HATED this movie. I know that most of you
really love it, but I don't. I just don't see the point. It's just some
idiot (nothing against mentally disabled people, but he's an idiot)
sitting there telling his stupid story. However, NOTHING HAPPENS! He
talks about all of these things that happened to him, but it doesn't
matter. Would he be any different if these things didn't happen to him?
No. Does any of it affect the plot of the movie? No. Does it matter
that he happened to be in certain places at certain times? No, not
unless you count that they got to show off the technology to splice him
in with historical footage. Also, how exactly is it believable? He
walked across the entire country. Right... He invented the smiley face.
Right... He did a bunch of other stupid stuff that I have forced out of
my mind because I HATE THIS MOVIE. Right... I just don't buy it. I
can't. I wont. Neither should you. Nothing even happens until the very
end of the movie. &quot;But,&quot; you say, &quot;the ending wont mean anything if you
didn't see the rest of the movie. That's what the movie's about.&quot; No.
It's not. The movie's about nothing. The end is pointless, as is the
rest of the movie. It's not funny. It's not magical. It's not
believable. It's not realistic. IT'S NOT GOOD!<br /><br />If I never hear another &quot;Life is like a box of chocolates&quot; or &quot;Run,
Forrest, Run&quot; or see a Bubba-Gump Shrimp place, it will be too soon.
