Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) has an IQ of 75 and plays a role in many aspects
of
American history, everything from Elvis to Watergate to the smiley face to
the integration of the University of Alabama.  The message of the movie is
that if you are stupid and you always do as you are told, then great things
will just fall into your lap.  The movie is beyond farfetched.  The movie
is
absolutely ridiculous and unbelievable.  The basic premise of the movie is
ludicrous.  There is no way to make it work.  This movie is a real insult
to
the intelligence of the viewer.  Tom Hanks is totally obnoxious in this
movie.  I never liked him anyway.<br /><br />The movie glorifies stupidity and treats us, the viewers, like we are
stupid
too.  When Forrest's mother says Forrest is named after General Nathan
Bedford Forrest, we see a flashback of General Forrest.  When Forrest talks
about Lieutenant Dan's (Gary Sinise) family, we see flashbacks of
Lieutenant
Dan's relatives.  I understand!  You don't have to show me!  The movie
begins and ends with a feather drifting around, as if we are too stupid to
get the message that Forrest drifts through his life aimlessly.  I get the
point!  I don't need to see an actual feather!<br /><br />The soundtrack is irritating.  The songs keep breaking into the movie in a
very annoying manner.  And they are so literal-minded!  When Forrest is
running, we get `Running on Empty.'  When Forrest goes home, we get `Sweet
Home Alabama.'  When Jenny (Robin Wright) walks out a door, we get `Don't
You Love Her As She's Walking Out the Door.'<br /><br />Forrest's mother (Sally Field) does something absolutely despicable to keep
Forrest in a school for which he is clearly not qualified.  Are we supposed
to admire Mrs. Gump for her devotion to her son?  I do NOT admire
her!<br /><br />The movie never even tries to explain how a person with an IQ of 75 somehow
manages to graduate from high school and college and join the military.
The
movie expects us to simply accept this fact without question.  And what
happened to Jenny's sisters?  The movie mentions them once and then
conveniently forgets all about them.<br /><br />The only good thing about this movie is Gary Sinise.  He plays a believable
character and gives a good performance.
