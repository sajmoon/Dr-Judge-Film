In my opinion: This movie has everything! It is a fantastic story about a
boy, who isn't really intelligent and so normally he has no perspective -
but with the love of his mum and a few simple-and-easy principles he
makes
his way. There is so much fun and comedy in the story. It contains so
much
about love, friendship, trust, comradeship and stupidity (&quot;Stupid is as
stupid does!&quot;). And all this in front of the american history background
from the 20th century.<br /><br />It's simply true: &quot;Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what
you're gonna get.&quot;
