An idiot savant.  His girl lost in the world.  And 3 decades of history.
These three intertwine to define Forrest Gump, the film about a man who's
experienced history in a way only he can.  Not quite fully understanding
the
things that happen to him, Forrest makes it through schooling, college, the
Vietnam war, a successful shrimping career, and most importantly, love with
a girl who can't seem to find her way.  Simple in life, simple in thought,
he redefines our complex lives into what matters most.  In Tom Hanks best
film to date, he proves what humanity should be.
