IMDb Top 250: 31<br /><br />Kids these days don&#x27;t see the right movies. While teens flock to the
latest Transformers or Saw, they neglect the past- even the not-so-far
gone 90&#x27;s. But there&#x27;s a strange anomaly in that trend... it seems all
my friends have seen Forrest Gump at one time or another. And after
finally grabbing it on Blu Ray, I can proudly say I&#x27;ve joined that
rank. Forrest Gump is a fantastic film, and certainly a good one for
the masses to see.<br /><br />There&#x27;s a better chance than not that if you&#x27;re reading this, you&#x27;ve
already seen the film. You probably won&#x27;t find anything here that
you&#x27;ve already heard before. But if you haven&#x27;t, read on! There are
better films than Forrest Gump, but not many, and it is certainly an
excellent film to see, arguably mandatory.<br /><br />Forrest Gump is a simple man with a low IQ, born in the 40&#x27;s. The film
follows his life, showing this impossibly innocent man experience some
of the most important events of the mid-to-late 20th century. But he
doesn&#x27;t care for any of that: he just wants to be with his girl, Jenny.
At its heart, Forrest Gump is a love story set against a historical
backdrop.<br /><br />There&#x27;s a reason the Blu Ray box says &#x22;Tom Hanks is FORREST GUMP&#x22;. His
performance is mesmerizing, a one-of-a-kind portrayal of a
one-of-a-kind role. A southern man with a low IQ, the embodiment of
innocence, who describes things in the most innocent way, like &#x22;the
loving father who liked to touch her&#x22;, &#x22;the men who dressed up like
ghosts&#x22; and other such things the audience understands. And the voice
he uses is so iconic and often imitated.<br /><br />But Hanks isn&#x27;t the only great: the film is host to a group of great
characters. There&#x27;s Jenny, Forrest&#x27;s childhood friend and love
interest. Bubba, Forrest&#x27;s war buddy and fellow misfit, who knows
everything about the shrimpin&#x27; business. Lieutenant Dan, as the tragic
CO who has quite a journey. And lastly Momma Gump, with her motherly
advice and willingness to do anything for her son&#x27;s education.<br /><br />There&#x27;s a great feeling to the film. Forrest is such a hero: he does no
wrong, he is the underdog from birth. It&#x27;s not cute or charming, but a
heartwarming story of beating the odds. Forrest goes from great scene
to great scene, with such greats as football, &#x27;Nam, the hurricane, and
the Anti-War rally. With the exception of the Vietnam scene, which is
very well handled for such a foreign scene in an otherwise
talking-filled movie, the screenplay has wonderful dialogue and a
quirky rhythm.<br /><br />A note to those who saw Zumeckis&#x27; first great film, Back to the Future.
Do not expect more of that. &#x27;Future&#x27; was a comedy with drama added,
Forrest Gump is a drama with humour added. It&#x27;s a more mature film,and
can take some dark turns, like the &#x27;ice cream&#x27; scene. <br /><br />I will draw a parallel to Goodfellas (a good thing). Where Goodfellas
shows what the powerful did from the 50&#x27;s to the 80&#x27;s, Forrest shows
what the everyman (and woman) did during that time. Also, like
Goodfellas, Forrest Gump has a fantastic period soundtrack with lots of
&#x27;Nam and hippie tunes. Not quite as expansive as the mob film, but
excellent nonetheless. Forrest Gump is also more specific: such events
as the University of Alabama conflict, Watergate (hilarious) and buying
stocks in &#x22;that fruit company&#x22; make for some historically accurate
humour, one of Gump&#x27;s greatest strengths.<br /><br />One relationship in particular is fascinating, the main relation
between Forrest and Jenny. They start off the same, but go down wildly
different paths, one constructive, the other destructive. They are such
opposite people, but only Jenny realizes that. It makes the ending much
more interesting, and so much more touching to see Forrest question &#x22;if
he&#x27;s smart&#x22;. This is one of the most fascinating aspects of the film.<br /><br />This won the Oscar for visual effects, but I didn&#x27;t see it at first.
The effects are very subtle. Like the ping pong ball, the feather, or-
WHAT how is he having a conversation with freakin&#x27; President JFK? The
effects aren&#x27;t revolutionary, but very effective. I still don&#x27;t know
how they made the conversations with the dead happen.<br /><br />On the back of the Blu Ray is a quote, claiming the film to be a &#x22;tonic
of the weary in spirit&#x22;. That&#x27;s the perfect description. Forrest Gump
is an uplifting tale of what a single man, even a fictional one, can do
with the hand he is dealt. In a decade remembered for its cultural
violence (Silence of the Lambs, Seven, Pulp Fiction) Forrest Gump is a
beacon of good nature, and good nature is something everyone needs.
