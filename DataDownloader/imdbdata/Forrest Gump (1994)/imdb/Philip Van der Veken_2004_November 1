Forrest Gump is the typical underdog that will be loved by almost
anyone. He isn't the smartest of all men, but he has a heart of gold
and a lot of luck. I guess some people already start running, screaming
and kicking when they read this kind of comments, but it certainly
isn't as bad as they think.<br /><br />Of course we all know that what happened to Forrest Gump would never
happen in real life. He met Elvis and learned him to dance, he met John
Lennon and two presidents, he was in Vietnam and started the Watergate
scandal ... he even got rich and famous. Of course it is impossible,
but I didn't mind a bit. I thought it was a very nice way to show how
time went by and how he got older. Why do we always need a little
subtitle telling us that it now is &quot;November 1, 2004 9.00 PM local
time&quot;? I loved the idea of showing us everything with memorable moments
in history. OK, some of the viewers don't know their history, so of
course they don't know which time period the movie is talking about.
Well, perhaps it is a good wake-up call for them: learn more about your
history!!! <br /><br />I loved the twists between drama and humor. It made this movie really
special. But a good script alone doesn't make a good movie of course.
Tom Hanks did an excellent job as well, he really made Forrest Gump
look believable, but so did all the other actors. <br /><br />All I can say now is that I really liked this movie and that I gave it
a 9/10. &quot;And that's all I've got to say about that.&quot;
