Let's go over the two main ideas at the root of this story, shall we?<br /><br />1) If you do everything you're told for your whole life, including
fighting in a war that shouldn't have occurred, you will be rewarded
with fame and fortune.<br /><br />2) If you question your government, you will begin a slide down a
slippery slope that will lead inevitably to drug abuse, prostitution
and attempts at suicide.<br /><br />In this contemporary parable, financial success is inextricably linked
to moral virtue -- with the obvious corollary that the poor are immoral
and unvirtuous. The film says as much with its portrayal of Lieutenant
Dan: he is &quot;living off the state,&quot; and, as a result, he is a
self-loathing, ineffectual alcoholic. Curse that welfare state. When he
becomes an entrepreneur on the other hand his life turns around and he
&quot;makes his peace with God.&quot; Moral virtue, incidentally, is defined as
unquestioning loyalty to a higher power, be it America or God -- in
fact, the two are pretty much the same thing.<br /><br />And they say Hollywood is too liberal.
