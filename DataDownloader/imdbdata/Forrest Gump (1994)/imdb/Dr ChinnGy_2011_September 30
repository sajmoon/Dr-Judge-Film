Simply . Each time watch the movie it changes my look to life ..
Brilliant movie in every single scene .. sometimes it makes you cry
sometimes it makes you laugh .. sometimes it gives you hope ..
sometimes it makes you feel that you are alive .. The Direction was as
simple as excellent .. Tom Hanks gives his lifetime performance .. The
story is so real and so catchy .. It worth to be the best of the best
.. In summary it worth each single second watching it .. If you watch
it you must like it and when you like it you must love it and when you
love it it will change you and will change your look to the life and
even can change your whole life .. It&#x27;s not just a movie to watch ..
It&#x27;s piece of art you must admire and you must love ..
