The moment I saw that Tom Hanks made a movie called Forrest Gump, I knew it
was about some person's life, as all movies whose names are the name of a
person.<br /><br />But there was something different about Forrest Gump... This shocked me a
lot, it was just different than other movies, and I could not figure out
why.<br /><br />There is no doubt about this: Tom Hanks best performance. (In my opinion..)
I think nobody could have done a better job than Hanks, because he was
simply spectacular.<br /><br />This movie was so good, because while watching it, you get to like Forrest,
and you don't want anything bad to happen to him, and you feel good when he
does something right, or when he gets good things, even by
luck.<br /><br />It also had a bit of comedy, which I think it was nice... (As a matter of
fact, I think the little comedy parts of this movie were funnier than the
whole Austin Powers movie).<br /><br />Forrest Gump really got into me.. It's a feeling that is a little hard to
explain.. But if you watch it carefully and paying a lot of attention you'll
probably find out how good this movie is, and how real things are.. This
movie could have been a true story.. After all, nobody knows if there is
someone out there just like Forrest Gump.<br /><br />When I finished watching this movie, I knew it would definitely win both the
best Actor and best Movie awards.<br /><br />This movie deserves a 10/10 score.. more than a lot of other movies that are
rated higher than this.
