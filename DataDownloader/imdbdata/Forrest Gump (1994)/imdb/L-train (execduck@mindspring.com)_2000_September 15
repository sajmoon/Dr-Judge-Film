this is gump.  you should need no other reason than that. i first read
about
this movie in a book called &quot;The World According to Gump.&quot;  Apparently this
movie came out in 1994, but it totally passed me by.  I had never even
heard
of it until last week when I read that book and saw a copy of gump in my
video store.  i watched it, and i thought it was so beautiful.  from
vietnam
to magic legs, this movie portrays the essence of that wonderfully absurd
character we know as gump.
