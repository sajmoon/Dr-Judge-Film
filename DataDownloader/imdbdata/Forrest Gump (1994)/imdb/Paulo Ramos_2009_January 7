2009_January 7 
This is the best film of 94 and this is huge considering that this year
were made The Shawshank Redemption (the actual #1 on the IMDb&#39;s list)
and Pulp Fiction, and they&#39;re both great movies but this one is the
greatest of all.<br /><br />Tom Hanks delivers another great performance as Forrest Gump, his
performance is nothing but magic, he truly deserved the Oscar for it.<br /><br />But the best of the film for me isn&#39;t Hanks performance but the script,
the script is truly great I think there isn&#39;t one flaw in it.<br /><br />And the film has very beautiful and funny scenes as well. I suggest it
to everyone.<br /><br />This is one of the greatest movies ever made! <br /><br />10/10
