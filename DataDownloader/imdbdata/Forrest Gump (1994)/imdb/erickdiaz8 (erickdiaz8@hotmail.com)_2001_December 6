Just imagine going to see a movie that all the critics of your country had
described as a real waste of time and money, while all the other people
who
went to see it, thought it was a beautiful, heart-touching and perfectly
done piece of art. Well, I guess that was the reason I went to see it at
first place: all the controversy!! And you know what: even though it might
lack what is needed to have the critics go crazy about, it surely has
everything that is requested to make you pass a very good time and left
you
with the sensation that life is priceless,  that the people you love are
very, very important and that, with a little luck, anything can work out
just fine. But I am not a critic, so watch for yourself and enjoy
it.
