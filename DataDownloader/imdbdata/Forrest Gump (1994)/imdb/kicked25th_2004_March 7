Personally, this is my all-time favorite movie. I know most of the lines and
quote them regularly, much to my friends displeasure. Everyone knows the
classic &quot;box of chocolates&quot; quote, but its not even of my favorites. I
especially like the beginning where he says &quot;Momma said they'd take me
anywhere! they was my magic shoes.&quot; You can often see me walking around
screaming this. Call it obsession or just idiocy, but I love this movie. It
depicts everything good in the world today. This movie should be a lot
higher (or lower as it may be) ranked. I personally HATED Lord of The Rings
and I think Titanic only did as good as it did because it showed bare
breasts in a PG-13 movie. Thats the truth.
