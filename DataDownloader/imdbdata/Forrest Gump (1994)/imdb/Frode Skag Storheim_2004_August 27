Because I play a lot music for myself and do a lot of composing, I always
listen to the score in every film I see, and the score in this film is by
Alan Silvestri, and he's done a pretty good job. Especially the piano-theme
in the beginning when we see this feather blowing through the
air.
&quot;Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you gonna get&quot;,
Forrest says, sitting on a bench talking to strangers. Strangers who listens
to this guy telling his whole story. And the story is quite good. Tom Hanks
does a fantastic job playing Forrest, and there' s actually a good reason
why he was awarded with an Oscar for this role. 
The Director Of Photography, Don Burgess has also done a good job in this
film, because some of the scenes in this film is like watching a beautiful
painting or going to a museum. Very nice!
Everyone out there who likes good films with a good story should definately
see this film. <br /><br />Regards from
