1998_September 20 

I don't get it.  Although I'm a sucker for well-crafted appeals to universal
heartstrings, I was mildly repulsed by Hanks' Gump and his
dim-yet-supposed-to-be sage insights on the major events of modern American
life.  Technically, FG has the right stuff, but the overall effect is all
wrong.  Gump should be likable, but he just comes off as either clueless or
a hollow witness of events.  I'll leave this sorry box of chocolates for
someone else, thanks.
