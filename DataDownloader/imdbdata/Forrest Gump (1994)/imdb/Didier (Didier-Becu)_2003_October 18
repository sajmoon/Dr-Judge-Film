Oscarmovies are mostly the kind of movies that are enjoyable to watch but
with a very overrated factor but luckily for me (the movie lasts 3 hours)
this movie ain't like this. Believe me, anyone who says this is the best
movie ever made must have lost some brain cells but it is just entertainment
with a high standard. Forrest Gump shows you the American history of the
21st Century in where anything that is of historical worth is linked with a
so-called stupid (from Lennon to Reagan). The acting of Tom Hanks is as
usual genius, just one of the best actors ever, and you can start saying
this movie is totally Americanized (it is, but never works on the nerves)
but the focal points are clear : humour and an outstanding
Hanks....
