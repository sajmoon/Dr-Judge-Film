...but the USA can make you rich, healthy and famous with the minimum
trouble to make this a pure Hollywood movie. Should I say that this movie,
though cast is okay and directing conventional, is much overrated. This
movie seems made for a religious and puritan American audience, and it
received here in France a particularily mixed opinion. Script has to my mind
many flaws, music is irritating, and again I completely disapprove the
meaning... so watch it (once only) if you have time and make yourself an
opinion but don't think you are going to watch a wonder just because of its
6 academy awards! 6/10
