Tom Hanks is Forrest Gump.A simpleminded mentally handicapped man who had
accompished alot in life.He spends the entire time in the film talking to
strangers about his life in which we see these events unfold as he tells
these stories.In his entire lifetime he has conquered his disability,taught
Elvis Presley to swerve his hips,Met John F.Kennedy and Richard Nixon,fought
in the Vietnam War and has become a celebrity.Forrest Gump is just a simple
man and what makes him a great person is that he isn't affected by any of
this.he just lives life to the fullest.Tom Hanks won his second academy
award for best actor for this film and was the first since Spencer Tracy to
win a consecutive oscar.A strong supporting cast along with Gary
Sinise,Robin Wright(Now known as Robin Wright Penn)and Sally Field Give the
film great support under Robert Zemeckesis' superb direction.&quot;Forrest Gump&quot;
is one of the films that I really enjoyed.
