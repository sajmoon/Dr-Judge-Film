I really enjoyed this movie.  It made me laugh and cry, but it also made me
think.  Forrest might have a low IQ, but yet, he smarter than most people I
know.  He knows it's not right for Jenny's boyfriend to hit her.  He's also
very loyal.  Even though Lieutenant Dan gives Forrest a hard time, Forrest
always stays his friend.  He also keeps his promise to Bubba, by starting
the shrimp business.  Finally, he's always loyal to Jenny, the love of his
life.  She changes with the times, but Forrest always waits for her.  Also,
when Forrest goes to visit her grave, he leaves the note that young Forrest
wrote to her.  He told his dad not to open it, so he didn't.  That too shows
that Forrest keeps his promises.<br /><br />Just when I thought that Tom Hanks's performance in &quot;Philadelphia&quot; was his
best, he comes out with Forrest Gump.  He is one of the best actors today,
if not the best.  &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is a movie you'll want to see again and
again...it's a masterpiece!
