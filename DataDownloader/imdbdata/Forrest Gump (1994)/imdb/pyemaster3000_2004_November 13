Firstly, the top ten is this: 1. Good Will Hunting 2. Godfather 1 3.
Godfather 2 4. Forrest Gump 5. Heat 6. Shawshank Redemption 7. Blow 8.
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid 9. The Shining 10. Ferris Bueller's
Day Off<br /><br />Secondly having Forrest Gump at an 8.1 average is ridiculous, who in
there right mind votes less than a 9?? Watch it again, its exceptional.
And if you don't like it and think 'this guy's an asshole' try viewing
the above list and try that on for size.<br /><br />Thirdly, Hanks is a fine actor, not quite in the league of Pacino, De
Niro, Nicholson, Walken or Brando, but he is in the
Newman/Norton/Cage/Depp/Spacey/Freeman bracket and that says something.
I would put him in just above them but just below the greats. <br /><br />Fourthly, how the film follows and depicts American culture through his
life, and cleverly entwines his simple experiences within important
historical context is captivating and endearing, sad and funny. Hanks
plays the role better than any other could.<br /><br />Fifthly, soundtrack. Step back through time and listen to differing
social periods as they role from one to the next. Buy this and you wont
be skipping many of the tracks.<br /><br />Sixthly, see you later.
