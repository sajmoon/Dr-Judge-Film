Forrest Gump tells the story of, well Forrest Gump. The man was born
with some disabilities, but he has overcome them and somehow seems to
be present at a lot of historical moments. He&#x27;s in love with his
childhood friend Jenny, who constantly eludes him. <br /><br />The film that beat my favourite film of all time at the Oscars. I&#x27;m not
hating it, I think that both films deserved the title. Forrest Gump is
something else. It seems to have been one of those, right place at the
right time flicks. Everything about it simply works, it&#x27;s heartwarming,
funny, intelligent and depressing. <br /><br />Tom Hanks gave us an unforgettable performance that goes down in
history as one of the greatest. He is lost in this character and Gump
takes a life of it&#x27;s own. Probably one of the most lovable characters
in the history of cinema. Jenny, the woman of his affections is played
by Robin Wright Penn, her performance is almost saddening. Her life is
constantly spiraling out of control and you can do nothing to stop it.
Gary Sinise is hilarious as Lt. Dan, the hard ass in the army who loses
his legs. We love to hate it at the beginning, then we come around,
much like his character. <br /><br />Speaking of losing legs, despite the film not needing a heavy load of
CGI, it uses it beautifully. Inserting Gump into old footage and giving
Sinise the lack of legs among other things. These are small things
compared to what people are doing today, but Zemeckis has always been
one to push technology in films, here he does it very well and never
does it encompass the film. The story is forefront, something that he
needs to get back into.<br /><br />Forrest Gump is an everyman film. Meaning the almost everyone will like
it. Some political messages may turn people the other way, but the
overall feel of the film is something that a lot of people share. Every
once in a while there is one film that touches a lot of people, I think
Forrest Gump is one of those films. Even though the film goes off in
many different directions, it works. Forrest in the army in one
segment, then running around the country in another? I love it.
