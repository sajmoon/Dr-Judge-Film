1998_November 12 

I like this movie very much. The first time I saw the movie, it was the
french version. The movie was good but the voices were not so good. Then a
saw the original version then I was surprised how much the movie was better.
Tom Hanks is one of the greatest actors in the present area, he won two Oscars
in a row. All of the supporting actors made a great job too. Tom was
marvellous in Forest Gump. I like the way Forest goes through modern
American history. The story is presented is a funny way. We saw all the good
and the bad mood America has go through. The music is also
great.
