Please understand that despite my summary, I did enjoy this clever
film. There was a lot to like. However, little of the film seemed
Oscar-worthy and it probably should not be in the IMDb top 250. I think
this is a great case of a very good film that has been prematurely
elevated to greatness.<br /><br />As far as the plot goes, with zillions of reviews on IMDb for this
film, I won&#39;t even bother. The acting was very good, the special
effects ranged from freakin&#39; amazing (such as digitally removing Lt.
Dan&#39;s leg--quite an achievement for 1994) to very, very poor
(inexplicably, despite Forrest being expertly inserted in many scenes,
the one with John Lennon was very sloppy and the seams were very, very
obvious on the big screen). The negatives included a few problems with
continuity (such as the happy face being supposedly invented by Gump in
the late 70s--it had been around for nearly a decade already) and
perhaps too much emphasis on episodes as opposed to story. Still, it&#39;s
a very enjoyable film and one you can&#39;t help but like. But winning 6
Oscars?! It must have been a very, very slow year.
