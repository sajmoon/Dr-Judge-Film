This film was wonderful mainly because of Tom Hank's excellent performance,
Robert Zemeckis' great job of directing and the beautiful score by Alan
Silvestri. Forrest reminded me of an child--someone innocent--exposed to the
cruelties of the real world. As a man who was honest, caring, and with high
morals, he's stepped on by others who engage in their own selfish pursuits.
Forrest Gump may not have been the brightest person of all time, but his
loving heart more than made up for what he lacked in his IQ. This is a great
movie. I strongly advise you rent it.
