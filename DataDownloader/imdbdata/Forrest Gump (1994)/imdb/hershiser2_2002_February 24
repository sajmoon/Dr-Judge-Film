This is one of the most ridiculous and over-hyped movies of all time, and
the sole reason I stopped liking Tom Hanks as an actor. Ridiculous
accents,
too many special effects, unbelievable story. The high point is young
Haley
Joel Osment as Gump Jr, and it's only at the very end of the movie that we
see him.
