<br /><br />Mythological tapestry of historical events viewed through a strictly
left-lib perspective.A film like &quot;Being There&quot; is profoundly more subtle
and
properly Zen,whereas Zemeckis' cartoonish re-hash of this film may have
been
revelatory for anyone under 30,or over 47(in 1994),as I'm sure every war
baby had a s**t-eating grin on their face leaving the theatre,at the
thought
of how their socio-political fantasy of the 60's and 70's had been so
poetically sealed.Required reading for anyone who liked this movie,and
probably won't after they read it: Dostoevsky's &quot;The Idiot&quot;.Thank you.
