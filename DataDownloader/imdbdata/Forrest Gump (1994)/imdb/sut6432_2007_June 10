There really isn&#39;t enough that can be said about this film. Everyone
involved should be extremely proud of the film they made. I really
don&#39;t think any movie in history has done better at capturing so many
different emotions. This movie takes you on an exciting, hilarious,
heartbreaking, heartwarming, tragic, and amazing journey. The acting,
especially by Tom Hanks, is nothing short of brilliant. The direction
and the special effects also stand out. Being born in the early 80&#39;s, I
wasn&#39;t around for a lot of the things that happened in Forrest Gump,
but it creates such an amazing mood that you can really understand what
everyone was going through during these times. From the 60&#39;s, to the
Vietnam war, and through the 70&#39;s and early 80&#39;s, this movie captures
it all. This film takes many people on a trip down memory lane,
wondering where they were at when all of these past events occurred.
These events, whether good or bad, have shaped America into what it is
today. I think Forrest Gump should be considered one of the all time
great films ever made...go ahead and see for yourself.
