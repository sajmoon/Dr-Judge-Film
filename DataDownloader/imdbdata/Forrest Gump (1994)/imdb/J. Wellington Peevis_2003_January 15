What will make this film endure is its apolitical skew when commenting on
major political events. Everyone is parodied, everyone's hypocrisy revealed
through Forest's simplicity, including the peaceniks - which is a welcome
change to say the least. I truly believe this is one of the better films of
the last quarter century. The reliance on special effects unfortunately will
weaken this film over time, that's just inevitable. When you watch it now,
the insertion of Forest into a number of historical events, which is a huge
part of the film, already show an antiquated technology. While this was a
new thing and sold the movie when it was released, it's more of a
distraction now. There are roughly ten major scenarios or chapters in
Forest's life that the film chronicles. Each completely as unrelated as can
be imagined, but they are all done so well and woven together so finely,
that never once is continuity threatened. The fifteen minutes or so of Viet
Nam is as good as that gets. The photography goes heavy on the earth's
natural beauty, and seeks to subliminally remind us how meaningless are all
of the seemingly crucial events that pop off while we live our lives.
Forest's inferior intellect allows him, although sadly unrealistically, to
seek and win simple love, gain serendipitous fame and fortune, and
ultimately attain nirvana because he is not burdened by intellectual fear or
cerebral reasoning. Really makes you stop and think about what is important
in this life we are blessed with.
