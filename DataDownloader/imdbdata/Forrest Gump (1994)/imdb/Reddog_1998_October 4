1998_October 4 

This is another one of those &quot;I wish I had my money back&quot; movies.<br /><br />Against my better judgement, my wife talked me into this.  My first
question at the theatre was, &quot;Who is Forrest Gump?&quot;
And we found out.   He is/was an IQ'd challenged young
man
that fascinated people, mostly because of an implausible plot.{How about the
hurricane sequence?} I also found out the movie's point of view is basically
to insult American morals under it's thick veneer of 'art'.
However, it is rather well made, with very nice production values, and
some appropriate casting, namely Sally Field.
Hanks, however, doesn't do the moron thing as well as say, Bill Murray
might have done it.
Oh, yes, the Viet Nam battle scene compares rather well with everything
else similarly filmed on THAT subject.
But once and for all folks, what's all the fuss about?
