Forrest Gump was there at every momentous occasion in American history
during his lifetime. But he never realizes this. He just walks through
them like an evening stroll in the park. But as I watched his life go
by, he tugged at my heart like very few film characters have.<br /><br />When Forrest Gump meets his son, the first thing he wants to know is
whether his son is smart. It is &#39;the&#39; moment of the film and almost
moved me to tears. It is shattering to realize that Forrest all along
knows what everybody thought of him. At once, we see the courageous
person that he is behind his mild demeanor.<br /><br />Tom Hanks plays the role of his lifetime. He is just perfect. I cannot
imagine anybody else as Forrest Gump.<br /><br />I have seem Forrest Gump about five times till now. The film only grows
on me every time I see it. A great film.
