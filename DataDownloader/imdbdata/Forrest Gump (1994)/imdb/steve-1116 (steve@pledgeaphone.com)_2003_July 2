This is one of the dumbest films I've ever seen. Tom Hanks is horrible.
The
premise is ridiculous. To think there was millions spent on this bunk
shows
how bad people's taste can be. First of all you'll never meet a person
that
mentally disadvantaged that can play football to any degree of excellence.
This is Hollywood at it's worse.
