Well, firstly i was caught sleeping when i first watching this movie in
the war scene. but 2nd time i completed it, n boy i should have been
really stupid to sleep in the first place. this movie depicts the
picture of a underprivileged kid, but it also teaches everyone has a
unique talent in them, no one is inferior. its a heart touching movie,
and the acting is a true masterclass. this should be one of the best
acting performance ever, not just the arduous nature of role the
character demands but also with how ingeniously its done. the
dialogues, role-play, and all everything is nearly perfect.this movie
is laudable not only for hanks acting performance but also for its
splendid storyline, and the way it progresses.never keeps you bored and
keeps you wanting for more.
