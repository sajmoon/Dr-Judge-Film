Forrest Gump (1994)- 5/5 <br /><br />Tom Hanks, Robin Wright Penn, Gary Sinise, Sally Field, Mykelti
Williamson, Haley Joel Osment. Directed by Robert Zemeckis.<br /><br />Possible spoilers.<br /><br />Fantastic Best Picture winner of 1994 that is heartwarming and
hilarious, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is a perfect example of a film to watch on a
bad day. The titled character is just so likable and understanding that
I don&#39;t know how anyone could give a negative comment about the movie.
Many dislike it merely because it won the Oscar over films like &quot;The
Shawshank Redemption&quot; and &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot; Don&#39;t get me wrong, those two
are great films, but there are some qualities in &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; that
are simply superior. The main character, played as an adult by Hanks,
is... &quot;different.&quot; He grows up in the small town of Greenbow, Alabama
with his mother (Field) and the love of his life, Jenny Curran
(Wright), but manages to leave the town and go to college to play
football due to his incredible speed. After college, he enlists in the
marine corps and is taken to Vietnam. After enlisting in the war, he
returns to America to find Jenny and to see where his life takes him,
and it&#39;s an amazing journey to say the least. Robert Zemeckis&#39;
direction is excellent and probably the best of his long career. Tom
Hanks never ceases to amaze me in this; it may very well be one of the
best performances in an American film I&#39;ve ever seen. Wright, Sinise,
Williamson and Field all do great in their supporting roles. The
editing and cinematography are just perfect. A great blend of both
comedy and drama, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is a truly unforgettable film that is
just about for everyone.
