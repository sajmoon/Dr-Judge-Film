As said in previous reviews, 1994 was a good year for movies. But in
the end one stood out among the crowd. This was &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;. With
its compelling story, lovable cast, and filled with memorable, and
hilarious, moments, it blew away the competition.<br /><br />Hanks is probably one of my favorite actors, mostly because of this
role. I also enjoyed Gary Sinise and Sally Field in their roles. If I
had any complaints, it would be Robin Wright Penn and her character. I
mean Forrest isn't smart, but he can do better.<br /><br />Other than that, and a little unnecessary language, I simply loved this
film.
