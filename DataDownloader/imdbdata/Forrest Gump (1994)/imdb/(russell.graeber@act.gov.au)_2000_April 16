'Forrest Gump' was an inoffensive and entertaining enough movie without
being spectacular cinema. However, my comments concern one (possibly two)
odd aspects of the movie<br /><br />President Jimmy Carter was NOT featured in the film. All the others except
Ford (his omission is perhaps understandable) were featured. In fact, it
turns out Forrest's actions were pivotal in the downfall of
Nixon.<br /><br />There's another odd aspect about Jimmy Carter. Not long after Forrest is
depicted watching American bi-centennial celebrations (July 4 1976,
presumably) he starts running from sea to shining sea 'for no particular
reason'. Furthermore, he stops running just prior to the depiction of the
assassination attempt on Reagan, from memory. This means that Forrest was
running (remember, 'for no particular reason') for just about exactly the
duration of the Carter administration. I guess this explains why Forrest
never met President Carter. Is this some sort of comment on the Carter
administration (perhaps that America lost it's way under Carter - a
dubious
proposition at best) or simply co-incidence? I wonder!<br /><br />Also, the landscape at the spot where Forrest stops running is the same
landscape featured on the Eagles Greatest Hits album. I don't think
there's
any sub text here, except that it's quite a remarkable
landscape
