1999_May 7 

People, this is a great film.  And, if you want to get picky about it,
it's
the only big blockbuster to make it onto the IMDB Top 250 in the past ten
years, with the exception of &quot;Terminator 2&quot;.  That just goes to show that
it
is not &quot;hype over content&quot;.  Many people were turned off by the idea of a
stupid person as the all-encompassing Everyman, but these were the same
people who left the movie theater dry-eyed and continued on their very
way,
looking for advice from Madison Avenue, dumping their oh-so-liberal views
on
whoever would be genial enough to listen, and oh yes, condescendingly
talking down to the local village idiot and then making fun of him behind
his back.  Believe me, I have known people in my time described as
&quot;village
idiots&quot;, and the personality with which Tom Hanks imbues Gump's character
is
dead-on accurate.  The film touched me in so many ways that my throat
still
lumps up every time the feather ascends to the sky with Alan Silvestri's
BEAUTIFUL music playing in the background.  Zemeckis should be proud of
himself for this one, which I think will go down as his masterpiece (and
that's saying something from the man who made &quot;Back to the Future&quot; and
&quot;Who
Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;).  Forrest Gump may have been slow, but he was
anything
but a simpleton...those who denounce people like him and their naive
worldview just envy the fact that their lives are built around a
shimmering
ideal brighter than all of the sexcapades and trivial pettiness of
normality.  Oh yes, and for the person who commented on this film as &quot;The
worst Best Picture Oscar winner of the 90s&quot;...obviously you haven't seen
&quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;.
