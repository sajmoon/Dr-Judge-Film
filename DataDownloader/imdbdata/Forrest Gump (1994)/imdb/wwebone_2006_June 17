First of all, I&#39;d like to say that I&#39;m stunned that this movie has as
low of a score as it does. I think that&#39;s crazy, to be honest.<br /><br />This movie is awesome. Just plain awesome. If you think this movie is
terrible, you must be nuts! It&#39;s a heartwarming tale about a guy named
Forrest Gump and all the stuff that goes on in his life. Some might say
that it&#39;s a bit unrealistic, but you can say that about a lot of
movies. It&#39;s called &#39;suspension of disbelief&#39;.<br /><br />I think this movie also documents history very well. That&#39;s one of the
things I liked about it. It&#39;s like a journey through time in a way.<br /><br />The acting and writing in &#39;Forrest Gump&#39; are both top notch.<br /><br />I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite movies of all-time.
Heck, it might just be my absolute favorite of all-time. It&#39;s just that
good. Everything about &#39;Forrest Gump&#39; seemed to hit perfectly on all
cylinders for me.<br /><br />Absolutely fantastic.
