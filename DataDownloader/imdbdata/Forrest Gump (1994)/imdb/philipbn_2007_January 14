A movie with this many comments obviously has great resonance. On the
one hand, the movie is technically skillful, well-acted, and used
then-advanced special effects to great advantage. As demonstrated by
the comments here, it has charmed many viewers. On the other, the
movie&#39;s values and message are clearly right wing: as many other
reviewers point out, the plot rewards ignorance, unquestioning
obedience, and laissez-faire corporatization (the marks of a good
heart, apparently!), while it trivializes retardation to charm viewers
with a saccharine vision of idiocy as goodness. It provides a
right-wing allegory of recent US history by punishing the free-thinking
Jenny and rewarding the mindless Forrest, named after Nathan Bedford
Forrest, a founder of the Ku Klux Klan. Charming!<br /><br />I share the view of those who not entertained by the movie&#39;s right-wing
allegory of Reagan-Bush era know-nothingism and historical blindness.
As another commenter put it, &quot;this is a movie for people who voted for
Reagan&quot; or for the Bushes. Overall, it&#39;s a remarkable document of
Reagan-Bush era dominant thinking.<br /><br />So the basic situation with this movie is not too difficult to grasp:
the movie is skillfully made and acted, and the wide success of its
right-wing plot and message demonstrates that the American movie-going
public largely shares these right-wing views.
