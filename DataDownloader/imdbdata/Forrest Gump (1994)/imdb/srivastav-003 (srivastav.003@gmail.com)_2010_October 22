i have no words describing this larger than life view from a point of
view of person who is mentally not that good as we people are , nothing
can get better than this , i have to say i loved every bit of this
movie , and most of all what this movie gives , is above all . which is
message of love , hope and everybody is unique in his way, no matter
what disability he posses , this movie gives you everything 1. peace of
mind 2. sooths your eyes with its incredible cinematography, and i have
to say this &#x22;i love tom hanks&#x22; ,what he can does with his acting
prowess i bet very few in world can do it . these people makes you
drive crazy for making your way into this industry , which gives ideas
like this movie to showcase , i wish someday i&#x27;ll like to make movie
like this or at least try . i give this movie 10 out of 10 . it
deserves more than that .
