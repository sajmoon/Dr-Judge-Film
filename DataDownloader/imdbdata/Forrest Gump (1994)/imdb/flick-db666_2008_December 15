This movie has nothing to offer film-goers apart from pollyannic
melodrama. Not one emotion or character has any depth or believability.
I scanned the list of other efforts by this director and found nothing
of merit there either. I&#39;ve offered more words than this drivel
deserves but this site requires 10 lines of text. I will fulfill the
minimum. This movie has nothing to offer film-goers apart from
