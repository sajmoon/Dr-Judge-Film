I sat in the back of the movie theatre just in case I hated the film
then I would discreetly run out. Prior to this Hanks film, I had only
seen him in silly pictures doing his TV acting stuff. To my surprise, I
fell in love with Hanks watching this film. I don't think that tears
run down my cheeks easily but this movie had them streaming. I couldn't
stop myself even though the tears started burning my face. Tom Hanks
has become one of my favorite actors because of his remarkable
performance in this film. Certainly deserved many more Oscars. I can't
eat shrimp any more without thinking of all the different kinds of
dishes you can make with shrimp. Great work!!!
