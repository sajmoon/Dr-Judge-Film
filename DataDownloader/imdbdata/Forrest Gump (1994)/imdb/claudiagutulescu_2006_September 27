After I saw this movie I had only one thing in mind. Are we all so
stupid that we don t want to be successful? So even a dummy is better
than me? I don t think so folks. Life is hard and success is like
lottery. As per Tom Hanks....what can I say??? He s perfect for the
role. He really looks stupid. I ve never been a fan of Hanks, and after
seeing the movies he played in, I m convinced I ll never be a fan.
Anyway, the advice I get is: don t go to work every day, just run for
days and someone will notice you and get you into the White
House...That s not even fair, but it doesn t bother me, since it is
really comic.
