I can't stress this enough: you must see this movie once in your life.
The
acting from Tom Hanks is unsurpassed, the storyline captivates you for
hours
without any pause, and the ending will bring a tear every time.  Movies at
IMDB tend to slowly lose rating points after they are released, and that
is
the only reason I can see for this movie being rated as low as it is.
This
movie is so good that the first time I saw it, I watched it over again as
soon as it ended--the only time I have ever done that for a
movie.<br /><br />You can have your Gone With the Winds and your Citizen Kanes.  The
greatest
movie of all time is Forrest Gump.
