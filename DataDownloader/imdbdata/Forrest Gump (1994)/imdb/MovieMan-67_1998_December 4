I must admit that I did not understand sadness in movies before this. This
was truthfully one of the only movies that I would ever even feel sad at
all. I've seen movies like Good Will Hunting and had no idea why people
thought that was so sad but this is a great movie that is funny and makes
you feel like you are there the whole time. I personally like this movie
because it's the only kind of non horror or action film that I can actually
get into. I recommend this to anyone
