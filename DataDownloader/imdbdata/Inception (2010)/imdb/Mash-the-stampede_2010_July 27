What are dreams? How do our minds construct alternate realities? What
is an idea? Can the seeds of an idea be planted in our minds?<br /><br />If we could construct our own dreams....how will that effect our own
reality?<br /><br />&#x27;Inception&#x27; is a spectacular, psychological, thriller so complex in
nature it has to be experienced on a personal level to be appreciated.
No review or recommendation can justify how good or bad this film is.
It&#x27;s all in the eye and mind of the viewer and how it is personally
perceived. I can explain the whole plot to you right now and it still
won&#x27;t spoil the film as Inception - like a dream really needs to be
experienced. <br /><br />&#x27;Inception&#x27; is not just a compelling psychological thriller, but also a
vast exploration and study of dreams and the dream state and what they
are to each individual. There are some brilliant insights into dreams
and the construction of dreams and the effects they have on our minds
and personalities which just adds to the films unique authenticity. The
terminology used is also excellent and makes a lot of sense such as
&#x22;the kick&#x22;, that falling sensation that jolts us awake.<br /><br />The cast is perfect. Leo Di Caprio has once again proved that he is
truly a remarkable actor and a legend of this day and age. Ellen Page
sheds her &#x22;Juno&#x22; persona and adds some weight to her character, proving
that there is more to her talent than just young girly film roles.<br /><br />So why not a perfect score? Well, Inception is not without it&#x27;s flaws.
The story in parts is quite convoluted and some key plot points are not
properly explained or explained at all - they just happen. The amount
of attention required to properly understand the film is vast and if
you are prone to &#x22;zoning&#x22; you&#x27;ll miss key plot points and no doubt be
confused by the end. Although the special effects are spectacular -
there is still nothing truly ground-breaking in that respect and some
scenes in particular were reminiscent of fight scenes from &#x22;The Matrix&#x22;
franchise which, if done 10 years ago - would have been more
spectacular.<br /><br />Still - &#x27;Inception&#x27; is without a doubt, Christopher Nolan&#x27;s finest film
to date and a revelation that there are still some original ideas
floating around Hollywood.
