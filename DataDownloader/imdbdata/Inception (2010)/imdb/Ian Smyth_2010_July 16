Inception is a film best delivered cold...that meaning, the less you
know about it going in, the more you&#x27;ll cling to the edge of your
seats!<br /><br />Nolan delivers again in this mind-boggling, action-adventure film. It
challenges both your mind and instinct, to trust your OWN mind that the
scene you&#x27;re watching is taking place in whatever level of dream (or
reality) the characters may &#x22;say&#x22; they are in. <br /><br />You don&#x27;t have to over-analyze this movie to watch it, but also don&#x27;t
sit back and let it wash over you...you will miss huge clues along the
way. <br /><br />The best way to enjoy this film is by, well, staying focused. Check the
time, take off your sweater; anything...and you could just miss the
clue to an entire 45 minutes of viewing. This film demands your full
attention and if you give it to it, you will come out of the theatre
with a big grin on your face expressing your &#x22;wow&#x22; and &#x22;amazement&#x22;. <br /><br />This film gets a perfect 10 from me. Acting was superb and plot was
engaging and astounding to say the least. The story sucks you in and
drops you out with a whole new look at the film.<br /><br />This is something you don&#x27;t want to miss.
