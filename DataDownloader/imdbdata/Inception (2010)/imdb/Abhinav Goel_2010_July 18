I think I am fortunate enough to be born in this era to be able to see
this movie.<br /><br />Inception starts off with a strange sequence and everyone watching it
tends to get confused in the beginning, but as the story unfolds it
amazes everyone.<br /><br />Movie has got a thought through script and at no point it appears a
work of illogical fiction, though the theme may be called a piece of
fiction but every event of the movie looks logical and it keeps the
viewers engaged and makes them feel part of the whole journey of Mr
Cob. <br /><br />All actors have done really well in their roles specially Leonardo.<br /><br />I would suggest everyone not to share the story of the movie with
whoever you are recommending the movie.<br /><br />Let everyone live through the experience of their lifetime.<br /><br />Thank You !!
