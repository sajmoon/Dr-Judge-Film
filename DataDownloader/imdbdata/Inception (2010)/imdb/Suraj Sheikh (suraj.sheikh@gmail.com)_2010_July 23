Right from the beginning to the end you will not only watch the movie,
instead you will LIVE the movie. Its kind of a fantasy we all have at
some point of time in our life. we are so many characters in our
dreams, and this movie is taking you 1 step closer to it.<br /><br />Everything in this movies is perfectly in place right from the
beginning till the end I was glued to the chair. First half will
provide you the explanation of what is happening. and second half is a
perfect execution of it. All the characters are simply perfect.<br /><br />In my life this is the first chance i am using the word &#x27;Perfect&#x27; so
many times for this movie. The soundtrack is amazing. it will pull you
inside the movie. every emotion is being played by Hans Zimmer. again a
perfect musician.<br /><br />Animation/Graphic: No question, its simply ineffable. Its a new
dimension in animation, simply innovative, without any impurity.<br /><br />This movie is a definition of; Improving Perfection.
