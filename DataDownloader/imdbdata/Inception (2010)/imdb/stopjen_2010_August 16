Everyone knows no matter how absurd it is, a dream is as real as
(sometimes more so than) reality. Instead of taking advantage of this
(lack of creativity? too scared?), the film confines itself to
mirroring reality in every way - be it time, space, surroundings,
physicality, ideas, or behaviours. Under the incoherent,
made-up-as-we-go logic, the film is but a low-grade action film in a
sci-fi disguise. The story line is laughably childish, the music is
over dramatic and there&#x27;s zero character development. It&#x27;s a shame to
see Ellen Page and Michael Caine&#x27;s talent abused in this dribble. <br /><br />It&#x27;s such a pity, really. In the right hand the same material could
flourish and treat us to mind-blowing wonders and imaginations.
Christopher Nolan has missed the point completely: dreams can be
absolutely anything. Anything! We want to see rules bent and physics
defied. But instead we were given the action sequence and plot from a
70s B movie. <br /><br />Entertainment-wise it&#x27;s not that bad a film (admittedly there are far
worse action films around), probably 2.5 stars if you leave your brain
outside the theatre. But given the current unjustified high rating, I
have to give it a super low one to tip the balance.
