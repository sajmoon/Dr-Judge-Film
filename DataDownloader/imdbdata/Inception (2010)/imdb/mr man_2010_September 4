This movie starts off really interesting, but fails to go any deeper
than lots of standard Hollywood crap like a really forced back story
for the main character. Characters lack depth, and the most interesting
part of the movie is its visual effects, which are nowhere short of
amazing, Avatar level production. However, in a few couple of years,
these CGI effects will not be that impressive anymore, and then people
will (hopefully) see how lacking this movie is for a good story and
characters. The average moviegoer will love this movie, but if you like
good movies in the sci-fi genre, you kind of expect at least some plot
twists. Still, the movie is good, and well made, but not great, It will
most probably be forgotten in a couple of years<br /><br />If you enjoy movies with action and CGI and want a movie to watch with
friends, go see this movie. If you are looking for something truly
original(storywise), then avoid this movie at all costs
