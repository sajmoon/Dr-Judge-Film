The concept of inception is powerful and spooky.<br /><br />The film left me wondering about our own lives and it was actually
distressing.<br /><br />The action sequences were spectacular yet it lacked purpose/substance
at times. &#x22;Ok, stuff is blowing up but I don&#x27;t know why&#x22;.<br /><br />The complexity of the film is deepened further through layering and I
felt that it was a way to propel the action. However, I felt it was
excessively complicated and could lose some audiences.<br /><br />The acting by everyone was good and the dialog shone brightly at
certain times. The cutting/editing must have been a nightmare and I
felt there was much that could be improved here. The audience went
through scenes at warp speed and my friends enjoyed it, but it turned
me off. It was hard to keep my eye on the prize when there was so much
going on. I simply couldn&#x27;t keep up.<br /><br />If Mr. Nolan&#x27;s mind is genius then I&#x27;m glad to be dim. I suspect that&#x27;s
how geniuses go insane. Concepts like inception has the potential to
drive people mad because of all the questions it throws at you.<br /><br />This film had a clever concept that I felt got maimed by excessive
complexity and understandably hectic cutting/editing. However, the film
has left a strong impression on me.
