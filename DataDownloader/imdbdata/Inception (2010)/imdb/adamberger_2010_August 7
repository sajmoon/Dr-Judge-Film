I went to see inception not expecting it to be that good because in the
previews, well it just didn&#x27;t look like anything special, however after
seeing inception I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes. It has got to be the best
movie i&#x27;ve seen in probably the last ten years. Without giving anything
away Inception is one of those movies that starts you off saying what
the hell, the kind that you find yourself wanting to give up on trying
to understand, and just when you think you don&#x27;t get it it hit&#x27;s you
with an indescribable WOW, then you understand it entirely and want
nothing more then to see it again and again it&#x27;s a must own. my opinion
see it twice mabey even three times it&#x27;s like a good vintage wine it
gets better the more you drink/see it. i&#x27;ll definitely buy it on bluray
as soon as it comes out!10/10
