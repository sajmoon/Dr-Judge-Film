Writer/Director Christopher Nolan&#x27;s follow up to the blockbuster Dark
Night was always going to be highly anticipated. But with Inception he
has more than delivered. In fact he has created a movie unlike any
other. It combines action, drama and suspense, with intrigue, romance
and it&#x27;s also a bit scary in parts. But somehow it never seems
overdone, which is a testament to Nolan&#x27;s skill. Dom Cobb (Leonardo Di
Caprio) is a master of a new form of corporate espionage called
extraction &#x96; stealing people thoughts from their subconscious while
they sleep. This ability has made him both sought after and a wanted
man unable to go home. A powerful businessman (Ken Watanabe) offers him
a job - that could wipe the slate clean and get his life back -
involving inception: planting (rather than stealing) a thought in a
competitor&#x27;s mind while he sleeps. This is a complex film with multiple
layers, and requires a fair bit of concentration. From the first
seconds to the very end it bombards you with fascinating twists and
turns, incredible special effects, thrilling action sequences, and
thought provoking characters. With such a rich tapestry of cinema on
show here, you could easily see this movie more than once. Di Caprio
gives another great performance. He both suits the role and does a lot
with it. Joining Cobb&#x27;s adventure are his team played by Ellen Page
(Juno), Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Dileep Rao, who are all great. Their
characters are probably not developed as much as I would like, but in
this film there simply isn&#x27;t time. Tom Hardy is particularly good as
the tough, cool and suave Eames. I think we will be seeing a lot more
of him. And Marion Cotillard is again excellent. There&#x27;s even notable
actors in small parts like Michael Caine, Tom Berenger and Pete
Postlethwaite, which is a nice touch. Like The Matrix or Memento, this
is a movie that will be discussed and debated. It&#x27;s thought-provoking,
visually stunning and highly entertaining. It&#x27;s been a long time since
I saw a movie that left the audience gasping at the end. If you only
see two movies this year, see Inception twice.
