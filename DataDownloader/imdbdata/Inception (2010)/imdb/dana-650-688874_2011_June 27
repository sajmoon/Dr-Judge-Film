AMAZING!!!!!!!! Every time i see this movie, i get goosebumps.
Chritopher Nolan has outdone himself in this movie. Everything is
excellent. from the music by Hans Zimmer to the acting by Leonardo
DiCaprio. This movie will make make you think..... about a lot. And in
case your wondering, it isn&#x27;t some cheesy action flick, it&#x27;s an
emotional Journey of a loving father to be reunited with his children
once again.<br /><br />The plot is one of the most original plots ever imagined. Christopher
Nolan must&#x27;ve been on some weird drug while writing this movie. All i
can say is watch it, It is worth the time.
