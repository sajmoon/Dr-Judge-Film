Nolan, you magnificent bastard, you&#x27;ve done it again. Through out
Inception, you could never tell what would happen next. Each minute
gets more and more intense. Though it was a long movie, you would want
to keep watching (Could we have a ten-second sequel to see what happens
to the top)? <br /><br />It&#x27;s a movie that gets you talking and thinking about the ending that
was left open. The CGI was amazing; Inception looked so real. If people
want a perfect movie, this is as close as it gets. The acting was
phenomenal; you couldn&#x27;t have casted better actors. <br /><br />I would recommend seeing this movie not just once, but many times. It&#x27;s
worth it. I would buy the DVD just to watch it more to understand it
better. I can&#x27;t wait to see what Nolan has in store for us next.
