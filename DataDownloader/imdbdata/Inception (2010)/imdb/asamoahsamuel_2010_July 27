2010_July 27 
Once every 10 or 20 years comes a film that revolutionises cinema. A
film that smashes boundaries and sends you on a journey through time
and space. A film that not tears up the rule book. It pours gasoline on
it and sets it on fire and then watch it burn to a crisp! INCEPTION, is
this film. <br /><br />...I sat for about two minutes after the movie had ended, in awe of
what I just witnessed. THIS MOVIE IS BRILLIANT! In a world where we
have reboot after reboot and remake after remake. Then we have TV
series revamps and the same old mindless, brainless action, drama,
thriller movies from the same boring directors. Finally something
original, fresh, clean and unadulterated comes along and just.....blows
me away! <br /><br />So what makes this film so brilliant? For starters, the cast. Great
cast, who all deliver great performances. DiCaprio continues to show
that he&#x27;s one of the best actors in the world at the moment and
continues to impress as the leading man. Great support from Ellen Page,
Tom Hardy and Jospeh Gordon Levitt. Ken Watanabe, Michael Caine,
Cillian Murphy and Tom Berenger also did a great job. The chemistry
between the actors is wonderful, clever script with sharp dialogue
delivered with great timing. <br /><br />Secondly, the story. It&#x27;s totally original. There are similarities with
the Matrix, but those will be squashed once you&#x27;ve watched the film.
The fact that the technology to enter a persons mind had already
existed was brilliant. There&#x27;s also no time line in this film,
Inception takes place in the not too distant future, but it doesn&#x27;t
tell you when. And I&#x27;m glad it does this. There&#x27;s nothing worse than
watching a sci-fi film and being told what year you&#x27;re in at the
beginning of the movie. Nolan wants you to work out how far in the
future we have come to possess such technology. This is his film, but
it&#x27;s also as if he wants you decide when it should take place. <br /><br />The film itself plot wise, goes through a number of hoops, but patience
is virtue and everything that happens in the movie, happens for a
reason. Gritty, solid set pieces and amazing special effects. The film
plays with your mind and that&#x27;s the best thing about Inception. It tugs
at you little by little and when it finally gets a hold of you, it
doesn&#x27;t let go. You have to work out with your mind, what is actually
happening? Where is this film taking me? <br /><br />I was hooked from the beginning and that&#x27;s rare for me. I became so
immersed, I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie.
Once it came to the end I wanted more. Then I realised after a few
minutes, I had to leave the cinema or get thrown out. <br /><br />Nolan is Spielberg with a higher IQ. He&#x27;s a modern Hitchock, who knows
how to make a film and tell a story. Do not be surprised if come March
this is nominated for several awards. Best Picture and Director being
two. <br /><br />I&#x27;ve written this review without giving too much away, even though what
I&#x27;ve written, doesn&#x27;t do the film justice. <br /><br />INCEPTION is on the same level as DARK KNIGHT in my opinion. <br /><br />With all the praise I&#x27;ve given it, INCEPTION is my film of the year.
Over time it will be regarded as one of the greatest films ever
committed to celluloid. It&#x27;s one of the greatest movies you&#x27;ll ever
see. It&#x27;s an experience, a journey and an adventure, INCEPTION. GO SEE
NOW!
