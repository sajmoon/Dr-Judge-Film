People will naturally want to compare this to The Dark Knight, and
while they do have quite a few things in common regarding the
cinematography, the epic soundtrack, and the relentless tension and
suspense, the stories are obviously worlds apart. The plot is not the
simplest or the easiest to keep up with, in fact it could be the most
convoluted one you&#x27;ve seen yet, and you will probably have difficulties
keeping up with what&#x27;s going on at times. But you will leave very
satisfied and wanting to see it again just so you can digest all the
rules and compounding events a little better the next time. I hesitate
to say Christopher Nolan was trying too hard and overdid it, but I can
see how many viewers would think that.<br /><br />What prevented Inception in my view from achieving the same quality as
The Dark Knight was that many of the supposedly primary characters
remained largely unknown with no window into their personality,
conflicts, or struggles, and this kept me from having any connection
with them. Although to be fair, the most important characters were
handled extremely well, but it was those other characters who had a big
part in the story (like Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt) that felt
underdeveloped. I hate to say it, but this aspect of the movie along
with the various Hollywood style gunfight scenes gave the occasional
feel that you&#x27;re watching just another popcorn action movie, but only
rarely and not enough to draw you out of the thrill of the story.<br /><br />Overall it was a highly enjoyable and thrilling ride, sometimes even as
psychedelic as Shutter Island with a similar subtle romantic feel. I
can also see how some might draw similarities to the Matrix, but don&#x27;t
let this put you off at all, this movie is an entirely different and
unique experience. A definite must see.<br /><br />I really wanted to give this a higher score, but with regrets, it&#x27;ll
have to be 8/10. A superb 8/10.
