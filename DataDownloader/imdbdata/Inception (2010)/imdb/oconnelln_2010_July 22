Just seen this last night and was on a high after seeing it. Excellent
storytelling and original concept. How did Nolan come up with this idea
and even better excute it. fantastic from start to finish was totally
gripped and all the actors were fantastic not a bad performance with
DiCaprio&#x27;s and JGL as stand outs. First 20 Min&#x27;s are a bit tough to
understand but once your over that everything comes together. Visuals
and effects were top notch and action excellent without been
outstanding but storytelling is his strong point and he excels here.one
minor annoyance i had was trying to understand saito(Ken W) ....which
was impossible at times.<br /><br />10/10 SEE IT NOW PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
