Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his crack team must perform one of the
hardest tasks known to man, planting an idea in a dream, within a
dream, within a dream. This is known as inception.<br /><br />Since the release of The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan has set a high
precedent by creating a masterpiece. Inception is no exception. People
may think that Inception is about dreams, which is true, but there&#x27;s
more. It&#x27;s about life and death, it&#x27;s about questioning reality, it&#x27;s
about family. Inception explores these topics and beyond in great
depth. The storyline is complex and everything needs full attention
from the viewer in order to understand it, yet due to the action, the
incredible special effects, the amazing acting and so much more, it&#x27;d
be almost impossible to take your eyes off the screen for a second. <br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio&#x27;s performance as Cobb is sublime. DiCaprio has never
acted badly, but can sometimes appear to try too hard; like a kid
wearing his dad&#x27;s clothes. Nolan has created the perfect role for him
and he pulls it off brilliantly. Cobb deserves success and encourages
empathy with everything that he goes through, whether it&#x27;s trying to
get back to his children or trying to let go of the memory of his dead
wife.<br /><br />If you enjoy action thriller films, but want see something deeply
intellectually stimulating, moving, Inception will suit you. It&#x27;s a
film that&#x27;ll be implanted in your mind allowing you to revisit it time
and again and will stay with you for a long time. <br /><br />The work of Nolan and his amazing cast has resulted in one of the
finest films of this generation. Inception will be talked about and
enjoyed by everyone, both now and in years to come.
