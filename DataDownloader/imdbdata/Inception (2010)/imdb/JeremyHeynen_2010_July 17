First off, the people who complained Nolan&#x27;s masterpiece, &#x27;Memento&#x27;,
was too hard to follow are going to want to kill themselves trying to
follow this one! <br /><br />This film is much like &#x27;The Matrix Reloaded&#x27;, all concept and no real
climax or conclusion. Unlike The Matrix Reloaded, we don&#x27;t already know
there is going to be a sequel coming next summer. Leonardo DiCaprio is
having the same issues we&#x27;ve already seen him deal with earlier this
year in Scorsese&#x27;s&#x27; brilliant &#x27;Shutter Island&#x27;. It&#x27;s Joseph
Gordon-Levitt&#x27;s character who is too cool and I would have liked to
seen more of. Ellen Page is great and the best scenes where with her, I
really would have liked to have followed her character around more, as
she learns how to be a &#x27;dream architect.&#x27;<br /><br />We get glimpses of awesomeness but there are too many things going on,
all at once, for us as an audience, to put our emotions into. It&#x27;s
impossible to find yourself on the edge of your seat when a film has
this much going on!<br /><br />&#x27;Inception&#x27; build and builds, introducing new concepts and ideas for so
long that by the time the action begins, minds are already invested in
trying to figure out how &#x27;Inception&#x27; works instead of being fuelled
with adrenaline to cheer on their favourite characters. Our minds are
set on getting to the conclusion so we can figure everything out but
the action sequences seem to never cease and we are torn between a
deeply intense psychological thriller and a James Bond-like action
flick.<br /><br />The people in the theatre with me did not leave happy or satisfied.
They were tired, burnt-out and confused as hell. This is defiantly a
movie strictly for Christopher Nolan&#x27;s fans and lovers of &#x27;The Matrix&#x27;
sequels.<br /><br />The ideas are great but there are enough concepts here to make 3 films.
It&#x27;s too much for an audience to try and follow everything that Nolan
has going on in this one single film AND actually feel something for
his characters.
