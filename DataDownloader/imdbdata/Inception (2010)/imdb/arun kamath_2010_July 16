It is one of the best movies. Oh yeah, then I remind myself of The Dark
Knight. I chose to give Inception 9/ 10 because giving it 10/10 will be
equating it with The Dark Knight.<br /><br />Nolan&#x27;s movies aren&#x27;t for those with low concentration power. You need
to be in the movie in order to keep pace with story. It is almost like
studying for an exam. And this one is the toughest of them all.<br /><br />The best thing apart from good acting from all those involved is great
script. It does not give you any chance to sit back and relax. You are
pulled inside the movie. The pace at which the movie goes is enjoyable
to watch.<br /><br />The important fact about this movie is that there is no stand out
character like the Joker. Each character has been given equal
importance and as a whole have done a splendid job.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan has taken great risk in making this movie. He is
banking upon the audiences to be intelligent enough to enjoy the movie.
You might hear reviews from friends saying that the movie is crap, I
heard it myself, but let me tell you that it is a must watch. If you
are the kind of movie buff who likes to see movie as an art and not
just for actors and actions and other secondary things.<br /><br />If you are going to watch this movie make sure you go when you have
nothing on your mind because you will need to focus on the movie.
