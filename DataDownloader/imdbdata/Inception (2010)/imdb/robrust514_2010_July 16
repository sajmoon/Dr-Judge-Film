I just got out of the movie, and I have to say that it&#x27;s almost
rendered me speechless. Very very rarely do movies draw me in as this
movie did. I can tell now why this screenplay took Chris 8 to 10 years
to perfect. There is so much care and attention to detail going on in
almost every facet of this film. Chris, with this film in my opinion,
has placed himself in the pantheon of some of the best modern
architects of film and story in the last 20-30 years. He deserves it.
What he has created with Inception is far beyond what most anyone is
producing. I have to applaud Warner Brothers for making this film
happen. My mind is still trapped in one or all of those levels of dream
state. I had become disenfranchised with the theater experience.
Inception renewed my faith that every once in a while it&#x27;s worth it to
pay the ticket, sit in a darkened theater and lose yourself for a few
hours. Awash in and held close by story and character. Bravo Mr. Nolan,
I hope the kick never comes.
