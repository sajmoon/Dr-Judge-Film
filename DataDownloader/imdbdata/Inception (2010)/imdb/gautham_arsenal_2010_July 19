The minute I saw Leo Dicaprio and Nolan collaborating to do this
project, I knew I was going to experience a brilliant one. Dicaprio has
an uncanny knack of selecting mind blowing projects, previously with
Marty Scorsese, now with Nolan.<br /><br />This was a gem of a movie. It was a very exciting and captivating
script and was flawless in it&#x27;s direction. The fact that it was
written, directed and produced by Nolan tells us what a genius he is.
He explores the concept of dream invasion. The cast here have done a
brilliant, it explores a very futuristic idea and has all the elements
a good movie needs(a little bit of comedy too, thank you bob!). It has
the one quality about it that is present in most greats, you cannot
take your eyes of it once you start watching. It is without a doubt the
best movie of the year so far and is a must watch.<br /><br />Oscar bells are ringing.
