The first time I saw Inception I really really liked it. It has now
become a favorite in my top three. I can obviously see why it won
Special Effects, Cinematography, Sound Mixing and Sound Editing. It is
awesome. Now it is time I have to complain. How does Inception lose
Best Picture, Original score and Christopher Nolan not even get
nominated for director? Inception should have won score and picture.
Perhaps it could have been one of those movies to win Picture and lose
Director. Before I saw The King&#x27;s Speech I kept saying Inception was
screwed. Now after seeing KS I can say that for certain. Same goes for
Inception losing Original Score. Inception is awesome and got screwed!
