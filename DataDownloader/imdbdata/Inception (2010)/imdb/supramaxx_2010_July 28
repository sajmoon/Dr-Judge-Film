Inception by far was to me personally the most anticipated movie of the
year. I even refused to see the movie with a sober-mind, waiting a week
to acquire a good amount of psilocybin in preparation to watch this
movie. Well to say the least Inception was all I anticipated it to be.
A movie which is principally there with a purpose of philosophical and
scientific questioning. The science-fiction setting was appropriate,
the plot while paradoxical in some respects is still exceptionally
done, the acting with the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe and
Cillian Murphy was superb. The score by Hans Zimmer was haunting.
Overall the best movie of the year 2010. Inception is a contemporary
science-fiction classic.<br /><br />The Good The idea of invading dreams in order to steal secrets is a
fresh idea, but the idea of placing thoughts, of actually shaping
conscious thought is even fresher. This is what Dom Cobb (Leo DiCaprio)
and his crack team of extractors are hired to do by a mysterious
Japanese businessman who sets to convince a young heir of a
multi-national energy conglomerate to divide his dying fathers empire,
so the business man can assumingly gain more business. The Plot is
assuredly good, as the extractor manipulates the subjects consciousness
by creating dream worlds in which all the laws of physics could be
manipulated. The graphics and visuals of the setting are what really
made this film.However the hero of course has a mysterious emotional
past centered by a deceased wife and family. Which really makes you
appreciate the decidedly human conclusion of the film. There were also
some decent action scenes. The musical score was amazing. The acting
from all the actors was never lacking as well. The best quality of the
film however is that it makes the audience think. This is what really
made me love the movie. Any movie that makes you question reality is
well worth it.<br /><br />The Bad Nothing much. I thought the dream worlds could have been
designed with a little more imagination. As imagination is truly
boundless. But other than that I found the paradox of working for money
to be interesting when nothing is really real anyways. Others might say
that it borrows too much from The Matrix, but I find that excuse to be
a shortcoming. The action scenes might have been a little rehashed and
forced also.<br /><br />The Ugly A beautiful film. I really found nothing ugly except the old
man. LOL.<br /><br />Overall a wonderful film. Christopher Nolan really outdid himself in
this masterpiece. He is building a great reputation. I gained knowledge
from this film, the one thing I do know is that I know nothing.<br /><br />Supra Score- 9.7/10
