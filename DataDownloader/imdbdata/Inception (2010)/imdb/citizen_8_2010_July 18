Christopher Nolan has done it again. <br /><br />Nolan has touched and dressed up the movie with action (gravity defying
action), thrills, frills, suspense, guns, chase sequences etc etc etc.
Yet underneath all the glorious detail in appearance, there is a
brilliant story that is so unusual yet intriguing, imaginative yet
possible, innovative and compelling. The story is so intriguing that
you start questioning every element of it. However, Nolan does not give
you enough time as he keeps you on the edge of your seats, pounding on
you with the relentless pace of the movie.<br /><br />There is one important aspect though - the movie keeps you guessing. It
does not give you a definite answer. It is open so that each man can
fill in his own answer to the questions raised in the movie based on
his own understanding . That does not mean there is no conclusion to it
at all. Your mind itself is the conclusion. There is enough detail in
the movie for you to fill in the appropriate answer. He lets you
wonder, think, review and discuss about it.<br /><br />SO... By laying a strong foundation with the story that is original and
adding a strong support cast with all the necessary elements for a
blockbuster and then .. merging everything seamlessly into 2 hours and
30 minutes of brilliant screenplay(lengthy compared to current
Hollywood trends) - Nolan has provided a movie that caters to all
audiences. <br /><br />This isn&#x27;t a masterpiece in the true sense of the word. This is simply
perfection. Perfect 10!!!!
