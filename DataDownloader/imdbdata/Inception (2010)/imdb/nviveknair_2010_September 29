wow... am amused.. that&#x27;s all i can say about this movie. well it
should be noted that in this era wer most movies demands the audience
to be brainless while watching them, and do not think about the logic,
here comes Nolan, challenging each individual who watches the movie to
use his brain and to be a part of the movie. This is probably the best
movie ever made in the history of cinema simply because of the fact
that it is soo flawless in its execution.<br /><br />the cast is also near perfect, Leonardo di caprio once again proves
that he is a gr8 actor with this performance. I am not a huge fan of
Ellen page but still she also seems to have done a reasonable job.<br /><br />the movie is about cobb, who is a master thief, who steals ideas from
the minds of people. his skills are invaluable in the field of
industrial espionage. The idea is stolen by putting a person in a
dreaming state. the real fun of the movie starts with more complexities
such as dream within a dream within a dream and all...<br /><br />All together its a must watch and never to be missed movie..
