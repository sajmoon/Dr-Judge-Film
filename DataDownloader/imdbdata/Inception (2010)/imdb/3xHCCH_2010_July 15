What drew me to watch this film on the very first day of theatrical
showing was the cast, which was an incredible array of some of the most
intense actors in Hollywood today. We have Ken Watanabe, Cilian Murphy,
Marion Cotillard, Michael Caine, Tom Berenger, Pete Postlethwait, and
in the lead, none other than Leonardo di Caprio. The director and
writer Christopher Nolan also comes with a very impressive oeuvre
behind him, with &#x22;Memento,&#x22; &#x22;The Prestige,&#x22; and most recently, &#x22;The
Dark Knight.&#x22;<br /><br />This film is one of the most complicated films I have seen. A fair
summary is almost impossible to put into words. It is challenging to
follow all the jumping into and out of dreams, in dreams within dreams.
I won&#x27;t be surprised if you do not completely understand everything
that was going on by the end. However, the visual experience of being
in this multi-layered dream world is unmatchable in any recent films.<br /><br />I thought of &#x22;The Matrix,&#x22; and even Leo&#x27;s latest (excellent) work
&#x22;Shutter Island,&#x22; as this film proceeds to disorient you about what is
and is not reality. However, &#x22;Inception&#x22; goes several levels higher in
the hierarchy of convolutions in film. There are at least four levels
of simultaneous dream upon dream happening at one time at one point.
Amazing film editing work!<br /><br />Then there are technical aspects which were mind-boggling indeed, as
Nolan&#x27;s bizarre script required. The audience is brought inside
buildings, rooms, elevators, even entire cities where you lose the
sense of space, time, gravity and logic. It is a dream world--you need
to see it to fully appreciate what I just wrote. The musical score of
Hans Zimmer was strong and dramatic. These are definitely contenders by
Oscar time.<br /><br />This film is not for everyone. There are those who would dismiss this
as impossibly pretentious and pointless. But for me, &#x22;Inception&#x22; was
very stimulating and challenging -- a film well-worthy to spend two and
a half hours of our valuable time. Be ready to face this challenge when
you go watch it. I won&#x27;t be surprised if you feel you need to watch it
all over again.
