I went to see this movie with quite low expectations, plus the theater
was kinda crappy. There wasn&#x27;t even the thingie where to place your
drink. So before the movie started, I covered my nerves with 25% of my
popcorn.<br /><br />But then... the magic started! The beginning was quite unclear, but
everything was explained with time. Very soon I got hooked, so I forgot
about the uncomfortable circumstances in the theater. The point is to
continuously keep on the track to understand what&#x27;s going on. And I
must say, the plot is amazing. I loved the way it was filmed (filmed
like all those good movies: these little twists and filming tricks,
like something long expected uncovers in the end), the way the actors
played their roles, and how they kept the story so interesting. This
means how many facts they put into there. I was like: &#x27;&#x27;Hey, I know
that detail!&#x27;&#x27;, and how it&#x27;s all put into the movie.<br /><br />The music is awesome. Hans Zimmer never disappoints.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan made the Batman movie: The Dark Knight, which I
didn&#x27;t like so much. That was one of the reasons why I had small
expectations. That guy just surprised me.<br /><br />And, like my summary says, I&#x27;m speechless. After seeing this movie you
just want to tell all your friends to go and see it, and you just won&#x27;t
forget the movie. So go see this movie NOW!
