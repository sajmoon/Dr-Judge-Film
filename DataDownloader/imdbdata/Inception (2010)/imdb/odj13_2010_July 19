If you think that The Dark Knight was Christopher&#x27;s Best you surely
haven&#x27;t seen Inception. There&#x27;s not a single moment in the movie you
wanna miss. It just keeps on getting better and better. The cast is
great but the story is such that it takes all the credit away. Kudos to
Christopher Nolan. You indeed are the pioneer of film-making. The
visual effects are also awesome. As usual great background score by
Hans Zimmer, amazing cinematography, gravity defying stunts. Hoping
that Christopher Nolan continues his streak of blockbuster movies by
making one every two years. Its just the summer blockbuster you are
looking for. A summer package of AWESOMENESS!
