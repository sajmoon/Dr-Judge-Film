The cinema that watched Incpetion had problems at the beginning (the
screen went yellow) and we had to wait around 20 minutes before the
films started but it it finally started there was a cheer and then
everyone went silent. I have never been in a cinema where the audience
were as compelled as they were here. This was the start of something
fantastic, something that makes all of the films around it tremble,
this is Inception.<br /><br />I could start by trying to tell the story but that would be considered
stupid, this is a film that must be seen. The story is complex and
spends the first quarter/ third introducing you to the film. It is like
a security entrance where you are instead introduced to everything
before you can enter otherwise you will have no idea what is happening. <br /><br />Christopher Nolan has been able to create his masterpiece and has
outdone The Dark Knight. The film is flawless on every level;
cinematography is again brilliant, sound great, CGI great and the
acting is above and beyond what I was expecting. I expected good
performances but every actor involved was perfectly cast and are all
incredible. Leonardo DiCaprio does his best performance to date showing
an array of emotions to a very complex character. Tom Hardy, Joseph
Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Ken Watanabe, Cillian Murphy and Marion
Cotillard are incredible. <br /><br />Many will know that this film is about dreams and this is explored
really well. A simple idea creates so much depth. What they do with
DiCaprio&#x27;s character is amazing and will make you wonder what it is
like inside your own dreams and what you would do to your memories. <br /><br />Despite a long running time I did feel that more could have been
included. Having said that the pacing is great; we are introduced into
this world carefully so that audiences can understand everything.<br /><br />The story is unique but that does not mean that no time was spent on
the action sequences. One of the complaints people have had against
Christopher Nolan is that his action scenes good be better but here
they are gripping. They will keep you in suspense all of the way
through and there is a real sense of danger for the characters
involved.<br /><br />This film also has one of the best car chases that I have ever seen in
a film because it is so different from any other car chase that I have
seen before and would only fit in the context of this film. This also
goes for the other action/ fight scenes that are just mind-blowing to
watch; a part of you wonders how they were able to do it while the
other is just amazed. You have to see it on the big screen to fully
appreciate what they did. <br /><br />I remember Christopher Nolan saying that he felt relieved that nothing
could ever top The Dark Knight but he may want to consider what he
said. This is not another &#x22;I liked this film so I will rate it 10&#x22; I
reserve 10 for films that raise the bar, keep you gripped from start to
end, films where you care for the characters, have scenes that will
touch you and this film does all of those. <br /><br />This has been a mixed year in terms of the films released as some were
good (Kick Ass), others were also good but had some flaws (Robin Hood,
The Book of Eli and The Losers) and others were terrible (Clash of the
Titans). Thankfully this can rate as quite possibly the best film of
the year. <br /><br />Some will say that this nowhere near as good as The Godfather but that
remains debatable. What this is, is one of the best films that has been
released in over the last 20 - 30 years. Miss this at your peril. This
is a complex and engaging masterpiece. Turn on your brain and enjoy!
