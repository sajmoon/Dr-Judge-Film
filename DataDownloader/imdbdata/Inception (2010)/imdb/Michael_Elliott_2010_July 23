Inception (2010) <br /><br />*** 1/2 (out of 4)<br /><br />The &#x22;kiss&#x22; platform of recent years to keep it simple and stupid has
pretty much ruined movies to a point as it&#x27;s rare when one can walk
into a movie and have a real workout on your brain. Sure, our eyes and
ears are treated to amazing sites and loud noises each and every week
and some would say this causes the brain just to lose any type of
reality, which might be the reason certain people (cough Lohan, Hilton
and countless others) are able to be hot stories while better, more
worthwhile events are simply overlooked. If one doesn&#x27;t want to use
their brain then it&#x27;s best to stay away from this thing. It&#x27;s best not
to know too much about the story but it deals with a troubled man
(Leonardo DiCaprio) who has made it a job to break into people&#x27;s dreams
and steal their ideas. However, due to a personal tragedy, he is forced
to take a job doing the opposite, which is breaking into a man&#x27;s dream
to plant an idea. That&#x27;s pretty much all you need to know, storywise,
as director/writer Nolan will deliver the rest and while the end result
wasn&#x27;t a pure masterpiece to me, there&#x27;s no way you can deny the power
it does contain. Dreams have always played an interesting part in
movies but no other has taken you this far into them and delivered such
incredible ideas. Not only does the screenplay deliver a lot to think
about but we also get plenty of action and amazing scenes of
destruction. The trailer showed people just a little pinch of a city
turning upside down but seeing the full sequence was something truly
amazing. Other amazing sequences was the entire final hour when our
group of dream breakers must enter a multiple layer of dreams with one
damaging effect after another. If you&#x27;re familiar with Nolan then you
already know what he can do and there&#x27;s no question the man has talent
but it is something special that a film like this could be pulled off
at all. When you&#x27;re dealing with multiple characters in multiple spaces
and in multiple dream zones it would be easy and common for things to
just fall apart under their own weight. It&#x27;s very difficult to keep you
guessing from one moment to another without things either falling apart
or getting so complicated that the viewer simply gives up on the film
and moves on. The amazing thing is that Nolan never lets up on the gas
and instead just delivers one more bit of story on top of the next and
I thought it was amazing that he could keep the viewing coming along
for the ride and never lose us. I think some people are going to not
understand what&#x27;s going on or be able to figure out the multiple levels
but when you kick back and think about what you&#x27;ve seen I think most
will see that the maze had an entrance and an exit and nothing came as
a cheat. DiCaprio delivers yet another wonderful performance but he&#x27;s
got a terrific cast around him including Ellen Page, Michael Caine,
Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Cilliam Murphy, Pete
Postlethwaite and a great return from Tom Berenger. Each actor does
fine work in their roles and certainly help the story move along. The
nature of the story is a very good one but the visual effects are just
as good. Looking at all the action and amazing effects makes one really
appreciate the acting, directing and story even more simply because
they didn&#x27;t get lost behind everything else that was going on. I don&#x27;t
think there&#x27;s any question that one needs more than a single viewing to
catch everything happening here but that&#x27;s certainly not a bad thing
since each viewing will deliver bits and pieces that will probably take
the film into directions that you didn&#x27;t think were there.
