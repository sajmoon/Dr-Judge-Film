Leonardo DiCaprio is on a &#x27;good movie&#x27; streak. The Departed 9/10, Blood
Diamond 9/10, Body of Lies 8/10, Shutter Island 8/10, Inception 10/10.<br /><br />I went to the midnight showing of Inception at my local theater, and it
was jam packed. I had been waiting for this movie ever since I saw the
first preview a few months back, and now it was finally time. The
lights dimmed and a wave of &#x22;shh!&#x22; swept through the room. I prayed
silently that Inception wouldn&#x27;t disappoint. The movie began to play.<br /><br />The ocean. That&#x27;s the first shot of this movie, and the last thing you
see before Inception literally destroys every other movie that&#x27;s come
out in the past 10 or 15 years.<br /><br />Every actor in this movie is brilliant and no one is miscast. Every
shot, every angle, every sequence of this movie is absolutely stellar.
Every plot twist, every line of dialog is sheer genius. The pacing is
perfect, and the story is destined to become a classic. Honestly, I
have never been in this much awe of a film. The characters were
engaging and had depth. You feel like you know each and every one of
them, the suspense was awful (but in the best way possible). If I had
to put the title of &#x27;prefect&#x27; on any film, Inception would be it. It is
literally flawless.<br /><br />I have never seen a movie that actually made me sit on the edge of my
seat sweating and sipping on my Coke like a nervous wreck. I have never
seen a movie where I literally wanted to jump into the screen and save
one of the characters, I have never seen a movie that could make me
want to cry one second, shout out in anger the next, and rejoice the
next. That was the power of Inception.<br /><br />To say that this movie was good, or even great is a enormous
understatement. This move was without a doubt the best movie I have
ever seen in a cinema. Quite possibly the best movie I have ever seen.
I am going to see it again today. I recommend you do the same.<br /><br />Final Word: Simply Perfect. 10/10.
