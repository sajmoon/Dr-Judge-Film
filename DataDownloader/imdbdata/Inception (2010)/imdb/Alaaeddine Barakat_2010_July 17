Inception is a film that will leave you with an &#x22;O&#x22; feeling. Why?
Because it involves around the world that most of us fear, and yet love
to explore: The world of the dream.<br /><br />I have been so excited to watch this movie in the last couple months. I
have been loaded with tons of expectations.Then yesterday, on Friday
night, I have walked to the theater, had a seat, couldn&#x27;t tolerate the
trailers prior to Inception, and finally a feeling of relief descended
on me as the lights in the theater turned off and Inception began.<br /><br />The first half of the movie was so hard for me to grasp, especially the
notion of the dream within the dream. I couldn&#x27;t really realize when
the dream was a dream within a dream and when it wasn&#x27;t. But just as
time went on, the notion penetrated deeper and deeper into my mind. The
action went faster, the suspense of knowing what comes next became more
intensive with every other scene, and the music attached to those
scenes made them more powerful, more appealing, and more creative.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan has really made a contemporary masterpiece that has
all the needed elements to make a movie a possible masterpiece, from
its unique direction, to its wonderful storyline, to its moving acting,
to its touching music, to its stunning visual effects, and its striking
art direction. This is a movie that will leave you with an &#x22;O&#x22;
experience,it&#x27;s a contemporary masterpiece, and it&#x27;s above all a movie
that offers that the world of dream can be as real as the world of
reality that may turn to be by itself not as real as we conceive.
