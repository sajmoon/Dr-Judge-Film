If only I were alive when Tarkovsky was alive, to see his movies in the
theaters and know that he is alive and well. Too bad he was killed so
young! The world would be a much richer place now if Tarkovsky would
have had the chance to make more movies.<br /><br />But luckily geniuses are still being born. Those who believe that only
Tarkovsky, Bergman, Hitchcock, Kubrick and the rest of the cinema
pantheon were able to make great movies are obviously wrong.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan has always been great at making movies, but his
latest work, Inception, is beyond words. Movies are usually beyond
words because what can be shown cannot be put into words, but when I
say beyond words referring to Inception I mean overwhelming, perfect.
Of course, it may not address the ultimate questions like Tarkovsky did
in all his movies, but Nolan&#x27;s art takes a relatively simple phenomenon
like dreaming and works it into a wonderfully complicated experience
that keeps your brain hooked on and leaves you breathless when it ends.<br /><br />They say that this movie is invulnerable to spoilers. It may be so, but
I see no reason in trying to say what it is about. Suffice to say that
this movie is one of the best movies ever made and that we are
privileged to know that Nolan is alive and well and he may still have
good things in store for us, even though with Inception he may have set
a standard so high he may reach it never again in his live. But even if
Nolan will not give us in the future anything at least as good as
Inception if not better, we should still be grateful that he was born.
We are witnessing a legend being born! And speaking of legend, Leonardo
Di Caprio is on his way to becoming one as well. He is young and he
already has an impressive list of titles he has powered with his
acting. I am sure that he is becoming the next Bogart or Al Pacino if
not bigger than these two giants.
