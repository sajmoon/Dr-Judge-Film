When i first heard about this movie i believed it was just another
hyped up big budget movie, i was completely wrong. This movie is easily
Nolan&#x27;s greatest work of art. The acting and script for Inception is
stunning. For him to make this movie very complex yet easily
understandable is simply brilliant. From start to finish i was on the
edge of my seat along with everyone else in the theater and was
extremely pleased with the ending. This was the first movie to leave me
utterly speechless after leaving the theater. This is definitely one
movie you should see in theaters. I can&#x27;t imagine this movie not
winning film of the year because it is undoubtedly one of the best
films of all time.
