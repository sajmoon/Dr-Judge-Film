What happens when dream mixes with reality and their intermingling
creating a world so unearthly, a dream so vivid, a nightmare so dark
that the very fabric of the cosmos is being threatened by it? This is
what inception is. A paprika ripoff, two paprika ripoffs, many many
paprika ripoffs all of which verge in on a huge delusional nightmare.<br /><br />The main thread of the story is &#x27;DC mini&#x27; a next generation technology
which lets one to see his dreams and others to enter that dream. we
have seen infinite times before, mostly in the anime film &#x22;Paprika&#x22;
that a virtually innocuous thing may turn deadly, and exactly that
happens here. Dream terrorists rise, people penetrate into other
people&#x27;s dream and try to control them, and amidst all these our
central characters run within dreams and realities whose distinction is
being constantly blurred.<br /><br />Paprika is not about reality and not about dream, it&#x27;s about the
mixture of the two and hence can&#x27;t be totally comprehended by neither
the conscious nor the subconscious mind. It will leave you in a dreamy
state. Same with Inception.<br /><br />Recommended to all those who like David lynch&#x27;s stuff, Miyazaki films,
the fall, Tim Burton&#x27;s big fish, and Paprika, etc.
