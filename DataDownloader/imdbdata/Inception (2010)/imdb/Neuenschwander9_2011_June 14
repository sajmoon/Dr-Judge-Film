An almost straight ripoff of &#x22;Paprika&#x22;, except that this version has
been toned down. I gave it three stars, but only for the story. Do
yourself a favor and watch the original. I hope the whole staff for
this movie are sued for so much money that their grandchildren will be
in debt for the making of this aborted fetus. &#x22;Paprika&#x22; was much better
than this garbage. Christopher Nolan deserves to be hung by his
testicles, set on fire, stoned, and bludgeoned by Ron Jeremy&#x27;s
tallywacker.<br /><br />Its all been said about this movie. It is an obvious &#x22;remake&#x22; of
Paprika. Lenny Dicaprio looked uncomfortable and had no on-screen
chemistry with the rest of the cast. The CGI, although working hard at
the nitty gritty seemed to miss the whole picture that (dare I say it)
looked like it was from the 90&#x27;s rather than the late 00&#x27;s. Micheal
Cane delivers his lines with enthusiasm, but in a forced way as he
tries to fill the moulded shoes Paprika left in the original anime.<br /><br />Its the Paprika with crappy acting, horrible blue coloring and bad
cinematography. It is entertaining to see the Hollywood take on it
though. But The only point to seeing this movie is to see them try to
do Paprika and fail miserably. Don&#x27;t waste your time with this one.
Rent Paprika instead. As usual, Hollywood remakes a movie and ruins it
by adding 60 unnecessary minutes and changing the ending. Trust me,
Paprika is a MUST see.
