The reason the CIA does not use this crap as an enhanced interrogation
tool, because after first 20 minutes you confess everything even things
you have never done. I am not surprised about the current 9.0 rating
though, after all we are talking about a country who actually elected
Obozo. It took me three days to sit through this pseudo intellectual
steaming pile of crap. So just a few words that help me release some
steam: long, boring, pointless, stupid, full of clich&#xE9;s: like
everything is blue, the vest on that stupid actor with his bottle neck
shoulder ... The lesson is that I will be very careful with the next
Leonardo movie, this is strike two (first being Shutter Island).
