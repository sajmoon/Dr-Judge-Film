I really, really like Christopher Nolans movies, but I think this is my
absolute favorite! It&#x27;s clever,great action and Leonardo is always
doing a great job. They could have focused the movie a little bit -
They should have less people, it was a bit messy -. But apart from
that, it&#x27;s a great movie that I think every person who like these kinds
of movies will love. So I recommend this to everyone who are a fan of
clever movies and I hope you will see it and &#x22;experience&#x22; it!<br /><br />Now it maybe sounded like a 10/10 but because of the huge amount of
people I give it:<br /><br />9 out of 10
