This movie reminds me of &#x27;The Matrix&#x27; which is one of my favorite films
of all time. I like Sci-Fi and I like action as much as philosophy. So
when you mix all these ingredients together it becomes a really heady
experience which feels great for a nerd like me. It is intellectually
stimulating and entertaining at the same time. But there is one thing
you should know before watching this film - that there is no surprise
ending. I had this notion after watching 10 min of the film and that
spoiled the ending for me. Blame it on &#x27;Shutter Island&#x27; but anyway
Nolan steers clear of any clich&#xE9; in this regard. <br /><br />I wish I could enlist Cobb (Leo Di Caprio) to extract some good ideas
from Nolan&#x27;s mind or better still if Nolan could be good enough to send
Cobb to &#x27;incept&#x27; my mind with positive ideas. Anyway, the film is a
great idea in itself as it deals with common experiences that affect
everybody like DREAMS, REALITY, MEMORIES (Real, Imagined &#x26; suppressed),
IMAGINATION &#x26; IDEA itself. How Nolan weaves all these concepts into an
entertaining story is what this movie is all about.<br /><br />I think Christopher Nolan is the director of this decade. He has given
some of the most wonderful movies in the recent past. Prestige,
Memento, Batman series and now Inception. It is already in the top five
list in IMDb. Don&#x27;t miss it.
