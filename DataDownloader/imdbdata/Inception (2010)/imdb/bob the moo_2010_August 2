2010_August 2 
The important thing to start out with is to distance yourself from the
hype about this film because it will not help you when watching it, nor
is any of it totally justified. It seems that any mainstream film
(especially at summertime) that manages to at least do something
different or clever will be hailed as a masterpiece simply because it
is not Transformers 2. So watching it expecting to be amazed is
probably the wrong state of mind to be in. Likewise it is probably not
great to be expecting something impossible to follow, because again the
film is very clearly constructed and even when action is occurring
across several &#x22;levels&#x22; at once, I still found it easy to follow.<br /><br />The film is a thriller and, like many great thrillers it is one that is
built on an imaginative and clever concept. The world of dream
infiltration is well constructed and is also well delivered to the
audience; some people near me were muttering and asking confused
questions throughout, but personally I found it easy to follow for the
most part &#x96; and not because I&#x27;m smart but because the film does a good
job of bringing the viewer into the ideas and concept. In terms of
being an action movie, the second half of the film does pick this up
well and the race against time across all of the dream levels, with the
editing bringing it all together well so that you don&#x27;t lose what is
happening and indeed the movement of time and the importance of the
relative events are clearly understood to produce tension. Although the
dream worlds are a bit too &#x22;ordinary&#x22; at times (most of our dreams are
filled with things that don&#x27;t make any sense or have echoes of things,
rather than detailed cityscapes and gun battles) there is creativity in
the visual design and in particular a Matrix-esquire battle in a
spinning corridor is thrilling to watch.<br /><br />To its credit the stepping up of the action aspect does not mean that
the ideas that got us here are abandoned because they are not. The
importance of Cobb&#x27;s subconscious and in particular his own gnawing
guilt over the death of his wife initially appears to be just a way of
having a repeatable &#x22;baddie&#x22; turning up in various places throughout
the film, but actually she is well used to introduce doubt and
alternative interpretations to the film. As everywhere else, the ending
of the film was met with groans that there would not a confirmation of
the ending. Personally I think that &#x22;was the real level actually a
dream&#x22; is just an idea planted by the director to keep the audience
from simply finishing the film and walking away from it and that the
presented reality was actual reality. I can understand why some have
disliked this because it could appear like Nolan is going &#x22;or was it?&#x22;
without providing much more than the question, but I choose to see this
as just another tease, which he is perfectly allowed to do since the
whole film is about trying to get others to doubt their reality and
change their own minds by themselves (although not really).<br /><br />The cast deliver well. DiCaprio manages to produce an engaging
character who emotionally makes sense and it is his performance that
helps the deeper material in his subconscious work well and be more
accessible to the viewer. Gordon-Levitt is memorable for his action
scenes but he is also a good presence generally even if he has a lot
less to do. Page provides the viewer with someone to &#x22;come in&#x22; with and
she works that angle well. Hardy, Watanabe and Rao round out the team
well. Some of the bigger names had the potential to be distractions by
virtue of &#x22;oh look its x&#x22; but Caine, Berenger, Haas and Postlethwaite
didn&#x27;t really do that even if their actual screen times were minimal
compared to the recognisability of their faces. Cotillard works very
well to have her character vary across levels and contexts and I liked
her better than I thought I would.<br /><br />I&#x27;m not in agreement that Inception is a classic perfect film but it is
a very good one. If anything the elevation of this film is more to do
with how average and uninspiring the vast majority of films released
are, but I suppose that the success of this one is a good thing in some
ways to maybe counter that. The concept and ideas are well constructed
and presented to the audience and the film itself is not hard to follow
but does challenge the viewer to do the one thing that a blockbuster
normally doesn&#x27;t &#x96; pay attention. Doesn&#x27;t quite live up to the hype but
it is still a very good and engaging film.
