I watched Inception a few weeks a go and i was blow away! When
Inception was in the Cinema I was not that interested at all. <br /><br />For me this movie was a little bit underrated before it came out I
heard of it and did not care for it, but when I saw the reviews i
really wanted to see this as soon as possible.<br /><br />I was to late to watch it in the Cinemas. <br /><br />It came out on DVD and it was amazing. <br /><br />If you haven&#x27;t saw it yet do your self a favor and check it out you
wont be disappointed.<br /><br />10 out of 10 !
