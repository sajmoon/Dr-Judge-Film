2010_July 25 
At first I found myself caught up in the action and enjoying it. Then I
got tired of the music -- all it did was create tension -- then I
realized I didn&#x27;t care about *any* of the characters. Then it got
boring. I no longer cared about what happened next; it had become
predictable. <br /><br />As a kid I read a lot of science fiction and thoroughly enjoyed it. I
liked The Dark Knight and Momento. But this is not like those films. It
is poor science fiction, poor drama. It fails in all the important ways
that good drama succeeds: characters we care about; genuine emotional
connection among the characters; an ebb and flow to the rhythm of the
movie, with respite from the intensity; balance; a plot that has
integrity. This movie felt like an unending jackhammer. It&#x27;s a wannabe
Matrix.<br /><br />We no longer cared, we felt assaulted. When they began the third level,
we made our move. We walked out.
