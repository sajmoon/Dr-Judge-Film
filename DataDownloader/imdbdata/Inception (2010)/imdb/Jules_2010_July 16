There are many movie mysteries in life: What did Bob say to Charlotte
in Lost in Translation? What will the second Kill Bill sequel called?
Will Toy Story 3 make or break my childhood dreams? But out of all of
these obscurities, the knowledge that Inception will, in all likelihood
be as overlooked at the upcoming Academy Awards as Nolan&#x27;s last film:
The Dark Knight, is the most frustrating.<br /><br />Unlike his iconic mish-mash chronology of his prior filmography, the
narrative (though not for once without it&#x27;s thought provoking logic)
generally remains undemanding and plausible.<br /><br />Dom Cobb (DiCaprio) understands the infectious power of an idea or
otherwise known as: &#x27;The greatest parasite&#x27;. Notwithstanding his highly
perilous job, which is usually to remove an idea from a set target, he
now has to, in order to save his family, triumph the widely considered
impossibility of an inception: The ability to plant an idea within the
mind of a victim rather than remove it.<br /><br />Less than a year fresh from his first class Shutter Island performance,
DiCaprio firmly remains a beacon of admiration to aspiring young actors
yet again. Undeniably a riveting performance. Juno&#x27;s Ellen Page helps
clarify sense of the psychotic dream state as a newly recruited member
of the group, making the triumphant tale and importance of Inception
less confusing than expected. Support also comes from talented Joseph
Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard and Michael Caine &#x96; who to Nolan refers
to as his lucky charm; not that he needs one.<br /><br />Nolan, having now just finished his 7th film, with four of his previous
works among the IMDb top 250, all with certified freshness and a
scarcely small amount of Oscar nominations, at the very least deserves
a Best Director Nomination for the Memento movie making maestro. And
sadly it looks like we&#x27;ll have to wait a long time to find that out&#x85;<br /><br />Summer disappointments be gone. Inception is here.
