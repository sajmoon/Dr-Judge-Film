Inception, in my opinion, is one of the greatest movies that I have
ever had the privilege of seeing. It is original, clever,
action-packed, and thrilling.<br /><br />The acting is great, however unlike most DiCaprio films this movie
doesn&#x27;t rely on him carrying the weight of the entire thing on his
shoulders. It is very evenly distributed among his fellow cast members,
Ellen Page, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Tom Hardy especially. The
storyline is incredibly creative and astonishingly original proving
this to be better than Nolan&#x27;s Batman entries by a long shot. Even from
the beginning of the film there is plenty of action that continues on
throughout its entirety and steadily grows greater and greater as well
as better towards the film&#x27;s end. And though very small there are a few
comedic moments in the movie courtesy of Gordon-Levitt. The movie
itself I believe is a much more exciting and successful combination of
James Bond, The Matrix, and Ocean&#x27;s Eleven.<br /><br />To sum it all up you should not miss seeing this movie in theaters or
at all. It is the best movie this year by far beating out all the other
blockbusters in 2010 as well as my favorites from this year. You would
be missing out on, as the title says, the best and most original movie
of the year.
