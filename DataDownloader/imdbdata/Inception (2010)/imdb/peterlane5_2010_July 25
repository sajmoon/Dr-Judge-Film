Epic if you can keep up with it! I had doubts about it because of all
the hype. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve gone to a movie that has
been hyped up only to come away disappointed. But this really deserved
all the hype it got. I really do think it&#x27;s Nolan&#x27;s best movie since
Memento. I mean The Dark Knight was good(another movie that got too
much hype in my opinion.) But to me this is 10 times better. I was most
impressed with the story and writing. There&#x27;s so much going on which in
most cases is bad but not in this. Acting wise I would have to say that
Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ellen Page gave the best performances, but the
other cast is good as well. Until this I disliked Marion Cotillard
mostly because she was in Public Enemies which I didn&#x27;t care for in the
least bit but she&#x27;s great in this. But to me Inception may be the best
movie of the year so far! I can&#x27;t wait to see what Nolan will do next.
