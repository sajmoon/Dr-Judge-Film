All of the complaints that I have seen about this movie were ones
explaining how viewers did not understand the movie. Honestly, the
movie is really simple to follow, if you pay attention. I&#x27;ve only seen
it one time and I understood everything. Many are saying that they want
to see it twice in order to grasp everything, but one viewing is enough
if comprehension is all you want to get out of the second viewing. This
being said, I would love to see this movie a second time. The acting is
outstanding and the chemistry between the actors makes the movie so
pleasant to watch. You instantly forget that these are actors. The
chemistry between Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon Levitt is phenomenal.
Also, Leonardo is unbelievable as always, and no one can look better in
a suit. The topic is so engaging and I would recommend this movie to
anyone. It has been my favorite movie so far this year, and I will
definitely be purchasing it as soon as it comes out onto DVD. Spend the
money, see the movie, pay attention, and everything will be great.
