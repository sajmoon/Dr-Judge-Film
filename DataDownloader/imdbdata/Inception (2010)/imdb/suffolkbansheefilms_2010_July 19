Inception is a masterpiece, but in a very real sense that&#x27;s too easy a
description, and one which most film-goers will instantly be suspicious
of. Better to describe it as elegant, bravura film-making; emotive but
not manipulative, profoundly intelligent but not preachy or
patronizing, subtle but not impenetrable, thoughtful but not
melancholy, literally bursting with creative energy yet unashamed to
pay homage to its recognizable influences, and framed by powerful
performances upon which Christopher Nolan easily hangs his intricately
shot and crafted tale, from strong cameos from the likes of Tom
Berenger and Pete Postlethwaite to entertaining support from Joseph
Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy to carefully constructed and well-honed
central performances from Di Caprio, Ellen Page and the glorious,
lovely-yet-terrifying Marion Cotillard, whom the camera seems to love
and fear in equal measure. At its core its a simple heist thriller, but
its allowed to expand into so many other areas - action, romance,
philosophy, psychology, even architectural analysis - without ever
getting out of control, and the impression one gets is that of a
supremely confident director in total command of every aspect of his
medium, thoroughly enjoying playing around with ideas, images and
concepts he&#x27;s been mulling over for years. Its a film which requires
and rewards constant attention to its various layers, all of which run
in parallel in a mind-churning, yet very simple and believable fashion,
and which avoids descending into the trap of over-explanation so common
in summer blockbusters. And its never distant or overly analytical,
retaining a real human core at the very centre of its technical
brilliance. From its initially inexplicable introduction to its
triumphant conclusion, Inception runs riot with, and ultimately
destroys, the notion that audiences need to be treated as idiots to
enjoy movies, or that film-making by focus group or committee is a
plausible substitute for singular vision or creative endeavour. Bravo,
Christopher Nolan. Your best film yet, and I can&#x27;t wait to see what&#x27;s
next.
