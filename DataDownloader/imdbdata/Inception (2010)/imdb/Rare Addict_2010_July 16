From Memento, to The Prestige, to The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan is
quickly becoming one of the premiere directors of intellectual, yet
crowd-pleasing entertainment. Now, just to jump right in, Inception
continues this trend, while demonstrating more creativity than perhaps
any of his other films.<br /><br />If there&#x27;s one complaint that I can imagine people having over this
film, it&#x27;s that the plot can be particularly difficult to follow. And
while I feel that this is true to some extent, that&#x27;s because Inception
is, in and of itself, a puzzle. All of the pieces are presented to you,
and solving it depends not so much on intelligence, but on whether or
not you find that sort of element appealing in a movie. It&#x27;s a film in
which much of the dialogue is spent simply explaining the rules of this
complex dream world, and therefore demands that you be wide awake.<br /><br />Even so, there had still better be an endearing cast of characters to
follow, especially with this being a two-and-a-half hour experience,
and thankfully, Inception delivers. While none of them, outside of
DiCaprio&#x27;s character, have much back story to speak of, they all
feature exceptionally likable personalities, so by the time that the
stirring climax hit, I was concerned about the fate of each and every
one of them. Joseph Gordon-Levitt&#x27;s performance as DiCaprio&#x27;s
right-hand man, Arthur, blew me away in particular. The guy doesn&#x27;t
have a ton of screen time, but damn, does he leave an impression! <br /><br />Ultimately, however, Inception is the story of DiCaprio&#x27;s character,
Cobb. Now, I won&#x27;t say much, as giving any plot details outside of the
synopsis would be a crime, but suffice it to say, it&#x27;s some pretty
engrossing stuff, and DiCaprio definitely brings his A-game here.<br /><br />Also, as expected, Hans Zimmer proves once again that he is the boss
when it comes to musical scores, as each scene is enhanced tremendously
by his material. He&#x27;s the sort of musician who can make even the
simplest of actions seem more important than anything else that&#x27;s
happened in human history. If only you, sir, could score my life.<br /><br />With its challenging narrative structure, likable characters (if
somewhat lacking in depth), and sheer visual splendor, Inception is
easily among my favorite movies of the year, second only to Pixar&#x27;s
latest classic. It&#x27;s been a rough summer movie season, and while we&#x27;ve
still got quite a few weeks left before it&#x27;s officially over, Inception
succeeded in reminding me why I dig this medium so much.
