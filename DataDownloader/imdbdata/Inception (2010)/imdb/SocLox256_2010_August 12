With sequels and remakes running rampant, and everyone jumping on the
3D trend, thank you Christopher Nolan for not following suit, Inception
was a breath of fresh air that movie goers needed. Don&#x27;t get me wrong,
some sequels, Toy Story 3, are worth the hype that is attached strictly
because of their name. However, there is nothing quite like a fresh
idea that is executed well, really well. Inception is a difficult movie
to review because to reveal anything is to reveal too much. The
multiple layers of the script act just like a dream within a dream,
each one captures your attention for a different reason. With each
explanation or observation discussed comes a light bulb moment for the
viewer, it is something that you knew but would never think to explore
or in this case utilize. The &#x27;kick&#x27; and the beginning of the dream are
just a few examples of how Nolan highlights these ideas that the
audience can identify with in such a way that seems too simple to be
appreciating so much. He uses Ariadne&#x27;s character perfectly. Nolan
penned it perfectly so that Ariadne would have the process explained to
her, and so would the audience. This &#x27;dumbs&#x27; down the movie without
dumbing down the movie. The script only grows because of it and the
audience still maintains its integrity. DiCaprio, Cotillard and Hardy,
as well as the rest of the cast, give grounded yet strong performances
that are needed to carry the film through the layers. Joseph
Gordon-Levitt is fantastic and hopefully garners some attention as many
of his stronger performances in the past, Brick and the Lookout, may
have flown under the radar. The ending of the film hits the perfect
note both as a punctuation mark to the film and from a word of mouth
marketing standpoint. With the risk of sounding entirely too clich&#xE9;,
Inception truly is a movie goers dream come true.
