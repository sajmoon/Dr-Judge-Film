Nolan proves once again that blockbusters don&#x27;t have to be just plain
CGI (Transformers anyone?), and actually have am engaging script as
well.<br /><br />Inception was pretty good. I would not consider myself as the biggest
fan of Nolan, but i have liked all of his films, so maybe i already
fall into that category. Having seen all the praise this was getting, i
was expecting something grand in the theater... and something grand is
what i got, and more.<br /><br />While the acting isn&#x27;t the film&#x27;s strong suit, it&#x27;s not by any means
bad. Leonardo did a very convincing job as Cobb, and i was impressed by
Marion&#x27;s performance as Mal. Joseph Gordon did good, and Tom Hardy was
just amazing. I might get bashed here, but i also liked Ellen Page.
Cillian Murphy was amazing for me as well.<br /><br />But what this film did for me was having me real tight on the edge of
my seat. Nolan scripted the film in an amazing way, filled with
ambiguity and just plain awesomeness that i don&#x27;t know how to describe.
I liked the whole mission and how Nolan boarded the dream levels. I
found it very original, although i haven&#x27;t watched that many films
about dreams. I found the action scenes pretty good and all the
technical thing in the film are great. I&#x27;d like to see Harry Potter 7
get the Oscar for either Art Direction or visuals (because i am a fan),
but i know that won&#x27;t happen because inception does really deserve
them.<br /><br />I won&#x27;t lie and say that even though i did understand most of the film,
the saito business left me confused, so i backed my theory up by
reading some threads in here. I actually thought he was not dreaming
anymore, and even if he was, it was a happy ending to see him with his
kids once again. <br /><br />Needless to say the audience gasped at the totem both times i watched
it.<br /><br />The score was really fitting, but i still want John Powell&#x27;s How to
train your dragon score to win the Oscar.<br /><br />Pretty amazing blockbuster film, showing how Nolan pretty much is one
of the best filmmakers of our time. Inception shall be remembered for
years, and very much deserves so.
