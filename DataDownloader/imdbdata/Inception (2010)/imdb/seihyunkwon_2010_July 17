I just came out of a movie theater. I am very shocked by this movie.
Dark Knight was super incredible but it is amazing how a guy can
produce another equally amazing master piece.<br /><br />Story, acting, directing are all rock solid. Carrying such a
complicated story can turn out to be a disaster but Christoper Nolan
has a perfect control over the progress of story.<br /><br />He plays the audiences&#x27; mind in a high level and never fails to lose
the composure and intensity of the story through the entire running
time. To that such an intense and emotional story, he also inserted
appropriate amt of humor to provide some relaxations.<br /><br />All the CG is wisely used and provides jaw dropping experiences.<br /><br />Acting wise, Leonardo Diccaprio does what he does basically providing
his overall great acting. All the others are also superbly casted.
Especially the guy from 500 Summer is better than I expected. He looks
serious enough and does provide some funny moments.<br /><br />Again, I am very impressed with what Christoper Nolan pulled off. In my
opinion, he is actually becoming one of those legendary directors such
as Hitchcock. Nolan got famous for stories dealing Human&#x27;s psychology.
This is another those stories but in a gigantic scale.<br /><br />Usually many directors fail to produce good movies with a lot of money
but this Christopher Nolan has no limitations. he did that in Dark
Knight and also in this movie, &#x27;Inception&#x27;.<br /><br />I look forward to seeing his next possibly masterpiece film.
