My second most highly anticipated movie is finally here. I had very
high expectations for Inception. Did it live up to these expectations?
Well, let&#x27;s just say that Inception exceeded my expectations and is my
favorite movie of the year. Not only my favorite movie of the year, but
one of my favorite movies of the decade if not my favorite movie of the
decade. Let&#x27;s get on to the reasons why.<br /><br />The story is so carefully crafted and so well told that it makes this
two and a half hour film feel like an hour because it&#x27;s so engrossing.
The movie makes the viewer feel as if they are dreaming and that they
are going through inception. This story is so brilliant and very
complex. It&#x27;s not confusing as long as you pay attention but it has so
many layers that makes it complex, you will be thinking about this
movie for a long time after. The story is flawless and I didn&#x27;t find
any plot holes. There is so much to be told but Nolan explores all of
it and the movie is very satisfying.<br /><br />The acting is incredible. Leo once again turns in a very good
performance and you really feel for his character. Joseph Gordon-Levitt
is awesome in his role and Ellen Page was also really good in her role.
Cillian Murphey was also fantastic in the role that he had. All other
supporting actors and actresses gave great performances as well.<br /><br />Hans Zimmer&#x27;s original score is fantastic. Zimmer&#x27;s score combined with
the visuals is definitely an incredible experience. This is my favorite
score this year and it&#x27;s very memorable.<br /><br />Now on to the visuals. This movie should take home the Oscar for best
visual effects. I can hardly believe some of the things that go on this
movie. The &#x27;folding city&#x27; effect that is seen in the trailer is
brilliant in the movie. My jaw was literally dropped for almost the
entire movie. There is always something amazing happening on screen.
Whether it&#x27;s the amazing visuals or the amazing storyline unfolding.<br /><br />There is plenty of action in this movie but it&#x27;s all for a purpose.
Nothing in this movie happens just because it can, but because it&#x27;s
important for the plot. Nolan is a master at mixing meaningful and
necessary action to forward an ingenious plot.<br /><br />I saw the midnight showing and at the end everyone gave the film a
standing ovation filled with applause and cheers. This is the must see
movie of the year. This movie should win the Oscar for best visual
effects, best director, and should at least be a nominee for best
picture. I think it&#x27;s deserving of winning best picture. Go see this
movie.
