Finally, I got a chance to see Inception today. I went in with high
expectations knowing how much I was impressed by The Dark Knight,
Christopher Nolan&#x27;s first true masterpiece. After watching the movie,
was I impressed? Yes. Completely blown away? Yes!! This movie indeed is
Nolan&#x27;s second masterpiece.<br /><br />The movie involves some awesome CGI works, powerful acting by the whole
cast and an intricate yet engaging story line. Films with equally good
CGI have released in the past, so there is nothing new about it. We
have also seen similarly themed movies so it is not really the theme
which distinguishes the movie. So what actually makes the movie so
good?<br /><br />One reason is the director&#x27;s ability to make you connect with every
dream scene in the movie. When you watch the movie, during many of the
dream scenes you&#x27;ll feel &#x22;Hey, something like this has happened to me
before!&#x22; or &#x22;Yes! This is exactly how it&#x27;s supposed to happen in
dreams!&#x22;.<br /><br />Second is the plot. Nolan invites you to a world of his own, presents
you the possibilities and the dangers of the world and then builds a
plot based on that world, a plot so brilliant that in the end you are
left dumbstruck in awe. Similar attempts have been made before (Steven
Spielberg for example, with his Minority Report) and I must say this is
the best such attempt ever.<br /><br />Overall, a heavily engaging movie, possibly the best movie of the year.
