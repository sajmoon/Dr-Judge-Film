It&#x27;s refreshing to see something at the movies these days that&#x27;s
original, for a start. It all seems to be remakes, sequels, and
generally ideas that have been done before with a couple of aspects
changed to make them supposedly &#x27;original&#x27;. <br /><br />This isn&#x27;t the most amazing film I&#x27;ve ever seen, doesn&#x27;t move to the
top of my all-time favourites list, it can certainly be faulted but at
the same time I can&#x27;t deny it was interesting, well written, decently
acted and tells a pretty good, definitely original story. The last hour
or so of the movie was brilliantly done in my opinion and while it got
a tad predictable right towards the end it was definitely entertaining. <br /><br />I feel that it sometimes got lost in itself trying to be too
multi-layered, it was always going to be a fairly in-depth story but I
felt certain aspects it could have done without or maybe done a bit
differently and it still would&#x27;ve been just as good. I felt it jumped
around a bit too much at times. <br /><br />It didn&#x27;t change my life or make me question my own reality or anything
like that, maybe that&#x27;s just me but I was certainly entertained and on
the edge of my seat for two and a half hours by an original story and
some great, smartly done action scenes and for that, I think it was
money well spent going to see this film.
