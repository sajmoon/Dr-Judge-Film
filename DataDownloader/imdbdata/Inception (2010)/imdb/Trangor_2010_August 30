Picked two films with very high ratings as possibilities to go see:
Dicaprio&#x27;s Inception with a very high rating (9 stars) and another
film, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World with an incredible 10 stars. The
Pilgrim movie seemed to be a bit young for me (about a guy in a band
having to deal with a girl&#x27;s evil ex-boyfriends in order to date her)
so I plumped for Inception which is Sci-Fi and which I usually like.<br /><br />I lasted about 30 minutes in Inception. It was trying too hard and
delivering nothing. Starting off with 3 dream-in-a-dream sequences,
mediocre acting, and non-existent dialogue, it got progressively worse.
I didn&#x27;t stick around, been there, done that. <br /><br />Luckily for me, I walked into the Scott Pilgrim movie in-progress and
saw a very different and funny movie. Yeah, it&#x27;s juvenile but
hilarious. A takeoff on bands, anime, gaming, and young love in
general. The casting/acting was impeccable for a no-name film and the
script made me chuckle through-out. If there weren&#x27;t so many gay jokes,
I&#x27;d take my kids to see it. Even if you aren&#x27;t into computer games, you
may appreciate a lot of the humor. Kids should love it.<br /><br />Best thing of all, it was more than payback for having to sit through
part of Inception, :^)
