I just can&#x27;t say how pleased I felt with my self for choosing to watch
this movie despite everyone who had watched it and told me it&#x27;s
incomprehensible. In my experience so far, &#x22;incomprehensible&#x22; is a
title given to movies by people of very limited concentration skills
and when I hear it I generally take it as a good thing. <br /><br />Inception is a movie that combines many genre&#x27;s and cannot be said to
be pure science fiction or even fiction. It deals with some classical
(and for some, detrimental or outdated) philosophical issues with a
very exciting and engaging way. The structure of the plot and the
unveiling of information is done masterfully, and even the most
fictional aspects are given in a very down to earth and &#x22;solid&#x22; way so
that they don&#x27;t undermine the climax of the viewer&#x27;s emotions. Superb
acting is happily married with breathtaking and very believable visual
effects and photography that will satisfy even the most demanding of
audiences. <br /><br />If I had to point out a problem I would say that it is a movie that
demands attention as the plot is so thick that even a momentary
distraction can limit understanding. That being said, it is not a
&#x22;cerebral&#x22; movie since the emotional narrative with it&#x27;s many
bitter-sweet pleasures is what shines in the end and makes this
architectural fantasy a movie that anyone should see.
