I watched it with five friends last night and other then one girl, no
one liked the movie. The potential is there but it was missed
somehow... <br /><br />There were more bullets flying in this movie, then six season of the
A-team combined! It didn&#x27;t really matter what was going on, all of a
sudden you had people shooting all over the place, then they would stop
and then the would shoot again.. shooting, shooting and shooting.. Hey,
if I wanted to see a war movie I would have rented Rambo instead!<br /><br />I don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s the big fuss about this movie. The plot is
weak, the ending is Meh and the movie is way too long. <br /><br />The idea is very nice but the writers tried to turn it into a big
Action/Drama/Thriller and they failed three times!<br /><br />A few cool effects but that&#x27;s about it.. two thumbs down!
