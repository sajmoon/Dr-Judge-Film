The essential problem with this movie is that it has no logic rules to
abide by. And, mind you, even dreams have rules, as Freud started to
hint. A rule is not &#x22;I do what pleases me&#x22;, which is what we see
throughout this movie. That&#x27;s arbitrariness. Mr. Nolan should learn
from hard working writers to build seriously an imaginary universe,
like Tolkien, Borges, Frank Herbert, etc. Worlds with RULES. Because
without rules, the writer can do whatever pleases him any moment. And
as anything is possible,... who cares? And as one stops caring, one
starts to get booooooored. Specially if in a supposedly imaginative
story you get punished endlessly with the oh-so-hackneyed pursuits and
shoot-out of faceless bad guys... Yah, yeah, yeah, original, new and
unseen as an Edwin S. Porter film. Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawnie!
