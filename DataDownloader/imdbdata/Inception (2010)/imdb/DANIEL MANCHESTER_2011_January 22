I watched this for the first time yesterday and am sure I will be
re-watching this time and time again. You have to stay on the ball all
the way through it and despite it&#x27;s length nearly two and a half hours,
it is time well invested. Big Budget, spectacular effects, huge cast do
everything to enhance what is a first class story, cleverly thought
through cinematically and story wise.<br /><br />It must be had to not appear good as an actor in a movie like this, you
have serious plot to consider, time to work on the process and a budget
that allows the whole process to breath. 160 million is a hefty chunk
of money but the effects are breath taking.<br /><br />If you want a challenge and entertainment and want to feel like you can
go back for more and more. Buy it, steal it, get it anyway you can, you
won&#x27;t regret the investment on any level.
