I think you are all DREAMING. I tried to watch this film FIVE, YES FIVE
times and just didn&#x27;t get it. Too convoluted, no character development,
bizarre jumping from one scene to the next without a common thread or
context. I have an exceptionally high IQ, and frankly, felt I was
watching &#x22;special effects gone wild&#x22;. Please, bring back the art of
true film making with great scripts, outstanding acting, real
characters and a plausible storyline.<br /><br />I felt this film was pointless, without direction and a total waste of
talent! Nolan did an excellent job with The Dark Knight; this film is a
disaster.
