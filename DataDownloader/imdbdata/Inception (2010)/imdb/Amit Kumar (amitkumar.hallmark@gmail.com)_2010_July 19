This movie has made its way to the IMDb number 3 movie in just 3 days
and wow what a movie experience. The graphics were way too cool and the
logic behind some scenes were stunning and gripping, and not to forget
the story and plot it was ... well wait dint i see a similar kind of a
story in shutter island? oh yeah I did the hero not knowing when he is
dreaming or when he is in reality and the climax well well lets not go
into it. This movie gets a 8 for its originality and brilliance in the
action scenes and the logic of the minor plot and the best use of
graphics i saw in a long time, where as I reduced the 2 points for
making the movie&#x27;s over all plot deduce-able. Why is the world gone
crazy about it? should you watch the movie or not? Well this is the
best movie of the year - entertaining at its core (better and a 10 if
you haven&#x27;t watched shutter island else you feel something repeating in
the plot - just made it a different concept). Please go and see the
movie - it is a must watch movie of the year and sure contender for the
Oscars for the best movie award.
