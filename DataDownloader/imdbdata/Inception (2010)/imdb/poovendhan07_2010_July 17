2010_July 17 
This is not only the best movie ever made about dreams, it is also one
of the best films of 2010, and certainly one of the most entertaining
pictures I&#x27;ve seen in a decade. <br /><br />A groundbreaking, intriguing, exhilarating and brilliant sci-fi
thriller that&#x27;s destined to become a timeless classic. Mark my words:
It will be remembered for years to come. Inception is elegantly
realised. <br /><br />DiCaprio powerfully embodies a tortured soul while Gordon-Levitt has
all the fun in the best action sequence. This is a drama built around
ideas and images; it is a cinematic maze that Nolan makes his audience
traverse in order to follow, understand and appreciate his world. <br /><br />It makes &#x27;The Matrix&#x27; look like a Dick &#x26; Jane book. The final half-hour
alone is a miracle of clockwork-precise showmanship. <br /><br />IF you are going to vote less than 10...too bad......I&#x27;m really
disappointed. This Movie Deserves 10 and The NO.1 Spot.....
