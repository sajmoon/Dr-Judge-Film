I am sorry i was forced to see this film. ( i was on a date and they
were 15 minutes late for the movie i wanted to see.)<br /><br />The story is is predictable. the ending is very predictable if you pay
attention to the first 6 minutes of the film. The one thing you never
do in a mystery books is let the reader get ahead of you, same goes for
a movie. The viewer should never know the ending before the movie
barely begins. The acting in this film is fine, most of the actors
really shine in this movie BUT Leo. I use to love Leo when he was 13,
but now he is an adult, and his acting hasn&#x27;t dramatically improved in
all these years.<br /><br />I would say this is going down as one of the worst movies I have seen
so far this year, but there were 2 other movies that would win that
title.<br /><br />I would recommend for anyone wanting to see this film to wait for DVD
or Cable. It just isn&#x27;t worth the time.
