Rex Reed&#x27;s review, which can be viewed on Rotten Tomatoes, says it all.
I don&#x27;t always agree with Rex, but the man is a movie critic of
long-standing repute, and he&#x27;s secure enough to call worthless dreck
what it is. I read the blurbs of many other professional movie critics,
and in one sentence, you can tell they&#x27;re disingenuous, people writing
what they&#x27;ve been told or paid to write. Spinners. Posers.<br /><br />Inception rating &#x3E; 9 on IMDb is what Michael Moore was referring to
when he said at the Oscars several years ago (he was referring to our
national politics, foreign policy and political leadership at the time,
but it applies to the mainstream media and all mass-marketing as well):
We live in fictitious times.
