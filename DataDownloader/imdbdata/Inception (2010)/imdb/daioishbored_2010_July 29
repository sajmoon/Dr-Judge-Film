I&#x27;ve read a good deal of the reviews for Inception, both glowing and
scathing. In the end I agree with the glowing reviews, even though I&#x27;m
sure that if I looked closely enough I&#x27;d see the same problems that the
less giving reviews pointed out.<br /><br />The reason? I went into the movie theater and lost myself in an epic. I
didn&#x27;t go in trying to find something wrong or incorrectly done. And in
doing so I probably saw one of the best movies ever. Far too many
people these days criticize movies over every single aspect...not
incorrectly perhaps...but unnecessarily. You go to a movie to escape
reality, to have fun. Not to pick it apart.<br /><br />XD though you may do so if the movie is terribly done.<br /><br />So in the end...yeah there are &#x27;conceivably&#x27; flaws with the movie but
if you are like me and are capable of losing yourself in something
really well done. Inception will hook you in from start to finish.
