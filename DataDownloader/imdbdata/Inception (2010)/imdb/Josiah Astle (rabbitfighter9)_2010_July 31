I was very excited to watch this movie, as i sat and watched these
losers go to all this trouble to do some pointless mission, when they
could have easily solved all this without going in someones dream. I
just thought the Whole movie was over the top and i didn&#x27;t care about
any of the characters and o wanted them all to die, especially Juno.
The story was stupid, no character development, everyone is afraid to
say that this movie is boring and that people are still obsessed with
that moronic dark knight movie. I think that if people would stop being
so dazzled by special effects and watched the movie for what it really
is they would see its just stupid and boring. If he knew how to make a
good movie he would make it shorter. My main problem was that it was
long, and everyone in it was acting poorly.
