Disappointed is the watchword.<br /><br />After the hype, the very least we were to expect was some post-Matrix
multidimensional psychotropic thriller made by the Stanley Kubrick of
his generation.<br /><br />Well, Nolan is no Kubrick, Inception has none of the surprise,
technical adeptness or tangible dread of the Matrix and the plot is as
multidimensional as the cardboard cutout characters.<br /><br />Instead, we got too many hours of a badly stitched together quartet of
substandard action pieces with some badly depicted bogus technology,
all glued together with a load of sentimental schlock.<br /><br />Shameful that this cost so much money to make when so many people are
dying of starvation around the world. I felt truly ripped off, almost
as much as when Equilibrium was foisted upon unsuspecting audiences.<br /><br />Save your money by donating it to a worthy cause or buying a copy of
the much more superior Existenz.<br /><br />Unfortunately, reality ain&#x27;t what it used to be.
