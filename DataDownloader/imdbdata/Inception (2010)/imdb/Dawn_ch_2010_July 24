2010_July 24 
I have never been a SciFi fan and have also never seen a C. Nolan film,
apart from the Dark Knight two years ago, which I found OK, but not
overwhelming (don&#x27;t kill me). I, however, think that Leo di Caprio is
one of the finest actors ever, and probably the best of this
generation. So I usually go to see all of his movies, independent of
the genre.<br /><br />Inception literally made me sit on the edge of my seat. This is one of
the most exhilarating, exiting, touching, moving, mind-bending and
eventually mind-blowing movies I have ever seen. Honestly, I saw it
about three days ago and have thought about it constantly ever since. I
am a big film fan and watch movies all the time, but this rarely
happens. I will definitely watch Inception once or twice (or ....)
more.<br /><br />di Caprio is simply brilliant (and this will hopefully finally bring
him the Oscar he has deserved for so long), as are all others, not one
actor is a mis-fit.<br /><br />As others here, I am somehow at a loss for words and cannot really
describe how unbelievably terrific I find this movie - all I can say
is: YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!
