Bollywood makes the most movies in the world but about 80% of them are
stolen from Hollywood and other film industries. Thats pretty pathetic,
but there&#x27;s a new plater in town, and it&#x27;s name is Hollywood! Most of
the films coming out of Hollywood are remakes, sequels, or simply too
formulaic for my taste, anyway, but now we have outright plot theft for
a change! Ten stars! They did not get the rights to crucify Japanese
anime favorite PAPRIKA with this trash!!! But who cares? I mean why
bother... They have totally destroyed a cult movie of very high
standard. The acting in this&#x22;effort&#x22; is shabby, the cinematography is
amateur, the dialogue had me in stitches from start to finish. I found
myself in tears of laughter at how bad this really was in every way
possible.<br /><br />I think the most tickling moment is when they tried to re enact the
&#x22;hallway&#x22; dream sequence scene with a hugely inflated Leonardo
DiCapprio - it was like seeing a hippo on speed - the original was one
of the most memorable dream sequence scenes ever animated but this was
like a terrible outtake.<br /><br />I hope the actors and director of this nonsense look back at it and
cringe with embarrassment because I certainly did. Its about time now
for Hollywood to admit they are completely out of ideas and begin
shameful acts of piracy, like INCEPTION! Frame to frame. That&#x27;s a
shameful thing for any responsible main stream actors and director.
Sort of Homage thing ? Yea possible, but Nolan and his company have
hardly mentioned about the original on either official ads &#x26; reports or
non-official comments. Instead, Nolan&#x27;s kept saying he&#x27;s got a bit
INSPIRED ONLY and INCEPTION is totally different from PAPRIKA or
something like that. Besides, more importantly, while shamelessly
copying scenes-by-scenes from PAPRIKA, Nolan intentionally missed the
KEY-POINT of PAPRIKA&#x27;s story for his own audiences&#x27; taste, for
COMMERCIAL PURPOSE in other words. Then how can we call it Homage?<br /><br />Xerox could have done a better job.
