Inception is a very good film. Just be aware that you may have to see
this movie more than once to grasp the concept of this movie. This
movie is designed to get you to think. I was able to understand the
movie the first time I saw it and I&#x27;m going to see it in the future
just for the heck of it.<br /><br />This movie is about a guy named Dom Cobb. His profession is to go in
people&#x27;s mind and steal their top secrets. Wanting to go home, Cobb
must break apart the empire of a dying father and his son.<br /><br />The acting is perfect. I would not be surprised if Leonardo DiCaprio
gets nominated for an Oscar. The other actors such as Joseph Gordon
Levitt and Ellen Page were great.<br /><br />The visual effects are outstanding. I know this will be nominated for
an Oscar in that category. The score composed by Hans Zimmer is perfect
and fits in with the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Overall, this may be the best movie of Summer 2010. I rate this film a
perfect 10/10.
