Whenever someone asks me to recommend movies, my simple approach is to
ask the movies that they enjoyed most in the past and based on that I
recommend. On that ground &#x96; if you enjoyed Matrix, you are likely to
enjoy Inception. (While the movies are very different&#x85; ).<br /><br />In the day and age when approx 90 % of screenplays are adapted (on
books, short stories, old movies), here is a concept that is gut
wrenchingly original. This is where I have deepest admiration for Nolan
as an artist and this is where he stands out from his contemporaries. <br /><br />This Original, Visionary, Fast Paced, Gripping, Complex, Multi Layered
Cant-miss-a-second movie is pure genius. Apart from being almost
perfect on all technical counts (Direction, screenplay&#x85;.) it is highly
entertaining cinema that is full of surrealism (which I am a big fan
of). I hate writing something which is fan-boy gushing, but its really
difficult here. I did not find any thing I did not like, I am sure if
maybe I saw it a second time. Dom Cobb (Di Caprio) leads a highly
skilled team, specializing in stealing secrets from people&#x27;s minds by
entering their dreams. When they are hired by a mysterious businessman,
Cobb finally has a shot at redemption, but not before achieving the
near impossible. Rather than stealing an idea, they must do the
complete opposite: Inception. Planting the seed of an idea. The plot
was very pleasingly intricate with a twist-and-turn,
keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type feel. <br /><br />I would be lying if I say that I understood 100 % of it, but then you
don&#x27;t expect that from Nolans, Scorseses, Lynchs or Kubrics&#x85; and tell
you what.. I am gearing up for the second viewing. Not once in life
time &#x96; but is certainly, once in a 5 Years stuff.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor &#x96; Get the tickets, big tub of popcorn and &#x22;Have A
Ball&#x22; !!
