It&#x27;s necessary to have one&#x27;s mind &#x22;ready&#x22; before watching &#x22;Inception,&#x22;
otherwise it will be easy to get lost in this labyrinth&#x27;s layers of
storytelling. The movie is maybe over-thought and sometimes too
complicated to understand and follow, however the challenging material
is quite satisfying. Nolan puts intentionally the viewers off balance
from the beginning of the story. As a result the audience has the
impression of being in the middle of the film, of living it personally.
There are ideas comprehensible (though not easy to understand) but
overall the reality depicted in the picture must be interpreted in
order to get to follow everything. The visual effects are stunning and
maybe the best ones ever seen to date, Di Caprio and Murphy both show
great depth of character, so if you&#x27;re willing to stay for a long time
and endure all these complications the film may work.
