I&#x27;m going to keep this short the movie was over hyped, I enjoy Nolans
movie Memento, he really took a complex idea and made it work.<br /><br />In this movie the idea fails and seems to mimic and follow the lines of
Matrix, although I feel Matrix had a better atmosphere, style, and
creativity.<br /><br />Although this is not a bad movie, but in my opinion it is not worth a
nomination for best picture, or the great reviews people are giving
this movie.<br /><br />I loved the soundtrack, and the CGI was really top notch in this movie,
what I didn&#x27;t enjoy was how the dreams were perceived and were fleshed
out they didn&#x27;t seem like dreams and they couldn&#x27;t control them like
you would your dreams it was more like a computer world, or alternate
reality/parallel universe.<br /><br />The story was also over complicated with subplots that took you away
from the film. I felt like this movie was stuck in mud and the only way
to break it up was to but some intense action sequences, which made it
seem to much like the matrix.<br /><br />I will not say I hated this movie, but did not enjoy it the way I
thought I would. I love dream/reality movies it my favorite topic it
just seems like this movie went to close to the matrix instead of
making a thought provoking movie about dreams/reality and what is real
what is not...
