**** out of (****)<br /><br />Christopher Nolan has truly took my breathe away from his slue of films
such as &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22; and &#x22;The Prestige&#x22;. He is such a visually
stunning director but his eye isn&#x27;t just on the style, but rather
focused on both style and substance. A majority of film directors
rarely can accomplish outstanding cinematography spiced up with an
inventive script, but Nolan&#x27;s the man. Even Hitchcock would give Nolan
a huge round of applause if he was still alive. No modern day director
can even come close to what Nolan has in stock. Darren Aronofsky may be
the only true director that matches the superb quality of Christopher.
Having seen the advertisements for this film, I knew that I wouldn&#x27;t be
let down and that this film would leave me in such great awe. After
coming back from the IMAX screening, I could say my expectations were
fully met. Nolan delivers once again, but to say my expectations were
just met is a huge understatement. Inception is the type of film that
is so captivating and awe- inspiring, that you will be left breathe
less for a few minutes. It&#x27;s the kind of film that is so informative
and evolving that it&#x27;ll leave you talking about the movie for years.
Move over &#x22;Avatar&#x22;, Inception is the film that will truly change the
way we have a perspective on cinema. If more films can even match the
perfection of &#x22;Inception&#x22;, I would never feel hesitant to pay the full
ticket price.<br /><br />&#x22;Inception&#x22; revolves around Dr. Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) who has plans
to plant an idea in someone&#x27;s mind. He just needs several people to
join the &#x22;Inception&#x22;. First, he brings along an architect (Ellen Page),
who knows everything about &#x22;Inception&#x22; and she can slickly create the
dream world to look so authentic that it&#x27;s nearly identical to reality.
Then Cobb brings along a supporting member (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) along
with the rest of the clan (Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Raio, and
Cillian Murphy). Cob believes that the only true way he can fix his
troubled past and be re-connected with his family is by taking this
job, although, it&#x27;s not strictly speaking legal. <br /><br />First of all, the script for &#x22;Inception&#x22; is nothing short of
phenomenal. I could not spot one plot inconsistency or plot hole.
Furthermore, the dialog feels so genuine and authentic, it feels like
you&#x27;re a part of the team. Moreover, the concept is so amazingly unique
and complex, that it challenges the viewer, which so far no film this
year has done that. Additionally, the script is always captivating and
never grows tedious and never over-stays its welcome. Next, the
performances are just unbelievably outstanding. Every member truly
sticks out and all of them are so absorbing and engaging that not one
actor or actress stands out from another. To add to that, the pacing of
this film is very brisk. There isn&#x27;t a scene that is prolonging or too
brief. This film is a nice package that blatantly shows that it was
well crafted together rather than feeling so stitched. Also, the
cinematography is just mind-blowing. The scenery will just take your
breathe away and inhale it. Truly remarkable in every sense. To top it
off, the action sequences are nothing short of stunning. This movie&#x27;s
main focus is not on action, but when the action graces its way on to
the big screen, it is amazing. To add, while the movie can be
perplexing at moments, it isn&#x27;t overly confusing to wear out a viewer.
Many other films have been way more frustrating in its source material
than &#x22;Inception&#x22; is.<br /><br />To be perfectly honest with you, I found no single flaw in this film.
Yes this film has a bloated running time, but it goes by so briskly,
that is feels like half of its running time. People protested about the
over-complexity of the film, yet it isn&#x27;t too confusing to frustrate a
viewer. In all honesty, and I usually side with the critics, I found
nothing wrong about this film or nothing I liked. Also people have
complained about how this movie is pretentious. I found nothing
pretentious about this movie at all and usually, films that try too
hard to impress, I find pretentious, but pretentious it is not. Also, I
love how people keep comparing &#x22;Inception&#x22; to other films based on
dreams (i.e. &#x22;The Matrix&#x22;, &#x22;Paprika&#x22;). I&#x27;ve watched both aforementioned
movies and &#x22;Inception&#x22; and all three movies are in a different
ballpark. The only similarity between the three is that it involves a
dream.<br /><br />Have you ever felt that a film is just so absorbing and captivating,
that it is worth every penny you spend? That film is &#x22;Inception&#x22;.
What&#x27;s even more astounding is that &#x22;Inception&#x22; is not only satisfying
enough to pay full price, but after you see it, I guarantee you&#x27;ll want
to see it a few more times before you leave the theater. It is just
simply flawless and daring, that it easily made my top twenty films of
all time. Nolan, you may just be the new Spielberg. Ladies and
gentlemen, why are you still here? Go see &#x22;Inception&#x22; now, then see it
again, then again, and then again. Probably the best movie you&#x27;re
likely to see this year.<br /><br />Note: Many have questioned whether the IMAX experience is worth the
extra money or not. It depends on what you like. If you don&#x27;t care
about movie enhancing experiences and just want to see the film, IMAX
may be a waste of your hard-earn cash. Although, if you want more bang
for your buck and want the film to feel as raw as possible, IMAX will
be worth every penny. I mean, come on, let&#x27;s do the math. Incredible
theater + Incredible Movie= Worth every penny. It&#x27;s that simple.
