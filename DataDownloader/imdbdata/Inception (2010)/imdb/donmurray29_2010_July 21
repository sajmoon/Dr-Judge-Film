My favourite Chris Nolan film is still his first that I saw, Memento,
but this tops all his films and anything that is out this year.<br /><br />It&#x27;s not a sequel or remake, other that The Expendables, it&#x27;s the only
original film this summer. Try so pay for IMAX for this, even though I
saw just a regular non digital print, which was fine, but for this, I
am going to see it again, but in IMAX, it&#x27;s that good.<br /><br />Anyone saying the story is hard to follow, well, it&#x27;s not. Complex,
yes, that means that it has been thought hard, and quite what research
went into the story would be very interesting to find out about, save
to say that since last year some research groups in American and Europe
have created some prototype machines that read the electrical signals
that the brain emit, so this sort of tech and new crime is really quite
possible, which made me nervous while watching this film.<br /><br />Some years before, Avalon, by Mamoru Oshii, is quite similar too
Inception, that is worth a look.<br /><br />In all, never listen to any hype, just see or do whatever you want to
do, I was going to see Inception anyhow, it is worth your time. Anyone
wanting to go into film screen writing should go.
