*spoiler*<br /><br />Its not obvious but the guy has waken up in the end. His mission is to
see his kids. He needs to complete the assignment. He needs saito to
get him through customs.<br /><br />The biggest issue/obstacle is getting through the assignment/dreams and
trying to not to mix it with his own personal ones. <br /><br />When he and his wife mal decided to take their relationship to another
level by being in each others dream , eventually , coming back to
reality became dull. Cobb knew the difference between a dream vs
reality but mal started to lose the concept. Mal committed suicide one
day in hopes to wake up from &#x22;reality aka bad dream&#x22;.<br /><br />Cobbs has this buden within him. Subconsciously he imagines his wife
sabotaging his missions, maybe to punish himself , maybe that he
doesn&#x27;t deserve to see his kids by himself etc.<br /><br />In the end the mission is a success. But saito is stuck in limbo. Cobbs
goes onto a mission to bring him back to reality. He failed to convince
his wife previously that she was living in the real world, was he going
to fail again but to convince saito was stuck in a dream? <br /><br />He doesn&#x27;t fail. In the end he sees his kids. He looks happy, he
completed the mission and is in peace with himself.
