It was an entertaining movie and got more intense every 10 minutes.
Overall I liked it, but as some of the reviewers said. It could&#x27;ve been
more. The concept of the movie is great but I feel they&#x27;ve only used it
for about 70%.<br /><br />I think they could&#x27;ve intensify the effect of the dreaming by not
wanting to be so fast about telling the story. This movie suffers a bit
from wanting to tell and do too much within a short period of time.
This is obviously something Hollywood these day&#x27;s is known for. I say
&#x22;a bit&#x22; because I can actually remember clear scenes in this movie.
Something to think back about.<br /><br />I just felt some facts or sudden place changing in this movie are too
easily accepted. Contrary to this, they did actually take their time
exploring some details that were important to the movie.<br /><br />All in all it&#x27;s a great watch. Definitely belongs within the top 50 of
IMDb, but a top 10 movie? No.
