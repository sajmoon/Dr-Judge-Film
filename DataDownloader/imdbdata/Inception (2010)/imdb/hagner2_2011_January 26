One is a rate to balance properly the fanatic reviews here. This is a
good movie. But is impossible that this movie flies above from the
source: The Matrix. Inception is a rip-off and comes 10 years late for
a chance to be consider original. Well, that&#x27;s it. Good soundtrack,good
cinematography, but none original. The effects are pretty good, but not
jaw dropping. The plot is just complex, but not intelligent .Nolan has
not been nominee for Academy Award and that is fair. If the Watchoski
was not too, why should be Nolan? I recommend people to watch this
movie. But I recommend those people don&#x27;t surf the hype. Otherwise they
will be catch in Nolan&#x27;s marketing.
