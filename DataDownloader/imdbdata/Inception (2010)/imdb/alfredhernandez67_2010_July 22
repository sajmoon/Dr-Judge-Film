Inception is a movie that challenges you to devote your full on
attention, a movie that keeps you guessing all the way through, a movie
that you will remember as a classic.<br /><br />With director Christopher Nolan, who has brought such classics as: The
Dark Knight, the Prestige and Memento. He now brings Inception to the
list of his classics. His enthusiasm and creativity once again defies
the law that every movie can be 5% or more boring. This is another
movie that is a bright light, and the viewer is a moth.<br /><br />With a tremendous script, great plot, and great acting... this movie is
meant to succeed. DiCaprio gives a great performance that once again
shows his devotion to his job as an actor. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has
took his acting to the next level in his breakout role, with a
performance this well, he is sure to be offered a number of major lead
roles soon. Ellen Page has finally taken a new role that surpasses her
sassy teenage style, though she needs a bit of work, her acting in this
film ensures that she is improving as an actress.<br /><br />Inception deals with the dream world, and what man can do with it.
Where ideas can be stolen and or planted, make a world that man has not
dared to create, defy physics, and live multiple life&#x27;s in a depth of
dreams. It brings your imagination and fantasies together.<br /><br />This is a great film, however... be warned, every detail (no matter how
big or small) is important.
