This is just an average big budget Hollywood movie.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t expect any complexity or depth from it, it is simple and quite
shallow.<br /><br />Technically it&#x27;s well done, the plot is OK, the actors are fine, the FX
are good and hopefully you will have a good time watching the
characters running and jumping around, ducking bullets and explosions
and so on while a VERY SIMPLE AND QUITE SHALLOW psychological-scifi
plot unfolds.<br /><br />But you won&#x27;t get much else from it.<br /><br />I&#x27;m giving it a 7. So folks, don&#x27;t believe the hype about this thing
being a fascinating and revolutionary piece of art, because IT&#x27;S NOT.
It&#x27;s just another Hollywood commodity out to make big bucks. If you
want some enlightening psychology read &#x22;?&#x22; and don&#x27;t watch this, for
***ck&#x27;s sake.<br /><br />There are some really cool effects to this film, but the story is so
convoluted that it detracts away from the story.
