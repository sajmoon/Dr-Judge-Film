wow . .this movie s simply awesome. how the hell did NOLAN think about
this concept.DREAMS,DREAMS, the idea of planting an idea is stupendous.
Screenplay has good pace enough to grip you.I think d editor would have
put his every bit of effort to create dis movie,cause showing dreams
inside dreams inside dreams is a really difficult thing.Leonardo scores
well with his acting,Ellen,Cortillard,Joseph,all of them have
contributed well to the movie . .and our SCARECROW(CILLIAN MURPHY),has
an important role unlike BATMAN BEGINS or THE DARK KNIGHT.He has worked
in his character .overall an s Oscar Waiting .Congrats NOLAN . .you are
one of the best in the Hollywood . .just getting BETTER and BETTER ..!!
