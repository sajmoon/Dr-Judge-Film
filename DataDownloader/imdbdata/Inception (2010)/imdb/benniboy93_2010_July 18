...its THAT good, i actually bothered to review a film for the first
time. The concept is just fantastic, so original. The actors are
brilliant, the special effects are spectacularly mind bending. The
whole thing is a perfectly balanced roller coaster ride; twisting and
turning but not confusing, action packed but not a gore show, fast
paced and yet containing enough philosophical themes to keep you
talking and thinking for a long time. I can safely say this is the best
film I&#x27;ve seen all year.<br /><br />Go and see it while it&#x27;s in the cinema, I&#x27;m pretty sure 90-95% of
people who watch it will love it.
