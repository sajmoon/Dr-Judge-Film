Hard to know where to start, too much unnecessary gunfighting. Didn&#x27;t
really need explosions as the premise of the story is fascinating
anyway - maybe the gunfire and explosions were for the younger members
of the audience.<br /><br />Mr Nolan is a major talent and has great imagination. But trying to
keep up with the dialogue was bloody difficult; really don&#x27;t know how
the young kids in the audience followed this.<br /><br />In the show I was watching you could feel the sense of giving up as
after about an hour and a half of dreams/subconscious/mind/ dialogue
plus a plot to try and unravel, the level of people talking and
giggling started to crank up. My concentration level started to wain
when they arrived at the snowy location - basically I threw in the
towel.<br /><br />Yes, it was well made, great to look at, the music was brilliant, but
even the ending lacked any emotional connection that the audience could
make with L de C.<br /><br />You&#x27;ve basically got to see this film at least 3 times to eventually go
&#x22;Oh wow! I get it, what a film&#x22;
