I suspected that the rave reviews for this movie came from mostly
teenage/young boys, and that seems to be the case based on the polls.
In fact, this movie is essentially impossible to follow, and worst of
all, you won&#x27;t care about a single character in it--not really, anyway.
There is no drama, there are simply empty characters mouthing nonsense
about dreams and dreams within dreams. It steals from the Matrix and
other movies, and does a far worse job with similar material than those
better movies did.<br /><br />Perhaps the first full hour or more is little more than chat that is
full of hot air and psychobabble but that probably a lot of people in
the audience don&#x27;t bother thinking about. Everyone&#x27;s waiting for the
special effects, which do come along, but when they do, you probably
won&#x27;t care what happens or for that matter, even know what is
happening. Vans falling from bridges, a snow fortress under
attack--why? What? No matter. You&#x27;ll be led to believe this all Means
Something, but it doesn&#x27;t, and worse, you&#x27;ll feel nothing too.
