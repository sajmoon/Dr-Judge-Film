The movie is about manipulation of dreams and how it can impact a
person&#x27;s psyche. Caprio, in this movie is a kind of dream terrorist,
who as a profession extracts information from people&#x27;s mind. This is
espionage of new times and he has become notoriously popular for this.
However, for the last time when he undertakes a job of planting an idea
into the mind of an heir to a giant business empire (Cillian Murphy );
things go wrong. <br /><br />I am disappointed by the script. The movie is conceptually flawed.
First of all, how can you dream inside a dream, I mean how one
transitions into next level of &#x27;sleepiness&#x27;. Even if one could, why the
machine used to coordinate the dreams also appears the same in the
dream and works also. Why one would age in a dream; I thought in a
dream the appearance of oneself is the mental projection of the memory
of oneself. <br /><br />Same genre has been portrayed by &#x22;Paprika&#x22; beautifully and is much more
consistent and meaningful than this version of a dream-control fantasy.<br /><br />First act was a bit interesting, but the plot goes haywire towards the
end; lost in an attempt to incorporate useless actions scenes. Ending
was as terrible as one would expect after watching the trifling second
act. Trying to give an inconclusive end was a bit pathetic after what
has been done to original &#x27;idea&#x27;. There was no &#x27;original inspiration&#x27;
in this movie. By the end of it, I was in level 5.<br /><br />Certainly a bad one from Nolan. This not nearly as good as &#x22;Following&#x22;
or &#x22;Prestige&#x22;. No surreal element; twisting the city was a fleeting
attempt though.<br /><br />Watchable once and that too would be worthwhile only on a big screen.
