I very rarely go to the cinema but I went to go see this... twice!!
Inception is one of the rare films that comes out that reminds us all
why we love films. I already knew what to expect from Christopher Nolan
before this came out. He is very good at what he does and as history
has shown he betters himself each time and this film is no different.<br /><br />Warner Bros. didn&#x27;t green light this film because they wanted to keep
their golden boy happy; they did it because the movie is a genuine
crowd-pleasing romp, and they knew it had potential for mainstream
appeal. This is a film that lives up to and exceeds its hype.<br /><br />If you think film makers have run out of original ideas and you have
been disappointed with recent films that have all action / special
effects and no decent storyline... then this film is for you!
