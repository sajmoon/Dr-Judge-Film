My first IMDb review. Well... My thoughts are so fragmented it&#x27;s
difficult to write a coherent review. This film is so wrong on so many
levels, it&#x27;s hard for me to contain myself. The rating and reviews are
proof of nothing but one thing, society is now dumb. That may sound
harsh, but after thinking my way through the childish attempt to delve
into existentialism, the moral bankruptcy, the flat characters, the
attempt at creating &#x27;cool&#x27; then that is the decision I&#x27;ve reached.<br /><br />It failed to deliver on every single level, even the special effects
were so in-your-face that even they became irritating (Surely if an
entire street is both below, and above you simultaneously, wouldn&#x27;t it
go a bit dark?).<br /><br />If you want a high concept film then rent Primer, if you want a film to
make you think, rent Waking Life or Fight Club, if you want excitement,
rent The Bourne Identity or something, anything, just please don&#x27;t see
this film, unless you&#x27;ve never ever ever questioned the reality around
you, and you&#x27;re thick, then maybe you should see it... Arrrgggghhhhh.<br /><br />To sum up a large part of the &#x22;concept&#x22; of this &#x22;masterpiece&#x22;, here&#x27;s
Inception without wasting your time and money.<br /><br />&#x22;The great Taoist master Chuang Tzu once dreamt that he was a butterfly
fluttering here and there. In the dream he had no awareness of his
individuality as a person. He was only a butterfly. Suddenly, he awoke
and found himself laying there, a person once again. But then he
thought to himself, &#x22;Was I before a man who dreamt about being a
butterfly, or am I now a butterfly who dreams about being a man?&#x22;
