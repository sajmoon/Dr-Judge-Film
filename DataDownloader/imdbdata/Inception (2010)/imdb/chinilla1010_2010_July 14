Is paprika the source of the story of inception ,which is directed by
chritopher nolan, the director of tdk? Yes! The dream is real! The best
part of this film is lifted from Paprika, therefore, it can appeal to
the non-anime fanatic crowd.<br /><br />The central premise of &#x27;Paprika&#x27; -- that scientists have invented a
machine that makes dreaming an interactive experience-- is pretty good.
Unfortunately, as &#x27;Inception&#x27; progresses, that central premise slowly
loses importance until, at the film&#x27;s climax, one could legitimately
wonder whether &#x27;Inception&#x27; suddenly ended and a different anime film--
Akira, Ghost in the Shell, and Princess Mononoke are all equally
plausible-- became ripped off. In other words, interesting ideas, but
an extremely clich&#xE9;d film.<br /><br />&#x27;Paprika&#x27; uses beautiful and astonishing animation and truly unique
imagination to bring us an adventurous story into the dreams of its
characters. &#x27;Inception&#x27;, however, does not. Imagination, heart make
&#x27;Paprika&#x27; stand out, whereas in the Paprika clone, &#x27;Inception&#x27;, it&#x27;s
millions being poured into advertising campaigns.<br /><br />So, it was an experience, but when it was over my 3 year old daughter
turned to me and said, &#x22;That was just like Paprika.&#x22; She didn&#x27;t think
it was worth her time to watch either. So, while this type of movie
appeals to many, I also believe that many who like good rather
&#x22;original&#x22; movies will come away from this one thoroughly cheated, as
we did.
