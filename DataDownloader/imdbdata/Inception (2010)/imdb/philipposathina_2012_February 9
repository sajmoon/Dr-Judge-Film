It wouldn&#x27;t be wise to despise this at any case great movie. Still one
may locate far too many &#x22;weaknesses&#x22; to put it right at the place and
rank it would otherwise deserve to be, if a little more &#x22;modesty&#x22; was
shown there: 1. Far as the script is concerned, this movie is based in
concepts we have already been familiar with in earlier films (&#x22;dark
city&#x22;, &#x22;Matrix&#x22;, &#x22;the fourth floor&#x22;). 2.In its effort to make its
script original by moving forward these concepts to a further level,
the movie turns to chaotic details, so many, that the poor spectator,
continuously shelled with them and the terms which represent them,
should keep a notebook to catch up with the story. Besides that, the
development of the script is to an enormous (for a blockbuster) extend,
based on lots of information that the spectator is provided with. Too
much for him to fully process and assimilate to follow the movie
without missing things and without gaps in his head about it. 3.The
sentimental part of the story(the main character&#x27;s personal drama), is
far too much put aside compared with the action part, which is far too
long, far to &#x22;mission impossible&#x22; style, far too chaotic due to the
&#x22;findings&#x22; of the script as written above (...too many &#x22;levels of
dream&#x22; I &#x27;m afraid). So the spectator is left just with the central
idea of the story leaving the rest for &#x85; another time. For Christ, one
doesn&#x27;t go to the movies to make a thesis about the new topic
&#x22;inception&#x22; introduces!!!! To tell the truth I had to watch the film 2
and &#xBD; times to understand it to a satisfactory extend, though some
questions still persist. It&#x27;s a pity! &#x22;Inception&#x22; would deserve to be
as deeply human and sentimental, as deeply emotional and touching, as
lyric and elegiac as its ambiguous yet imposing ending is...
