2010_December 30 
Well, after writing my summary maybe I don&#x27;t need to write a review.<br /><br />First off, this isn&#x27;t really my type of film. But I watched it and
tried to follow it as closely as possible.<br /><br />But the film is way too long, overdone, too complicated and too messy.
It is also too literal. Dreams are messy, choppy, chaotic and blurry.
For some reason, dreams for this crew are pretty neat and orderly. Sure
things seem distorted at times but not in a dream-like manor.<br /><br />And then the films starts to fall into the Hollywood formula with
chases, people shooting, people getting shot, blah, blah, blah.<br /><br />I frankly became bored with the entire thing and was glad when it was
over. I don&#x27;t understand all the fuss over this.
