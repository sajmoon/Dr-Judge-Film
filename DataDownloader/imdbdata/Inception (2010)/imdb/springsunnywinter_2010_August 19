Christopher Nolan is one of my favourite directors and Memento &#x26; The
Dark Knight are my favourite movies but for the first time I am
disappointed with his movie Inception. The film is all about is all
about stealing &#x26; planting ideas in people&#x27;s mind by using their dreams.<br /><br />The idea of the movie is good but the bad screenplay, 2.5 hours length
that drags really badly, plot holes &#x26; unanswered questions &#x26; Cobb&#x27;s
annoying wife ruined the whole movie.<br /><br />Inception is supposed to be a movie that requires multiple views to
understand it like Memento but there is no way I will watch it again
for the second time because it wasn&#x27;t that confusing and it boring
throughout. The dream sequences were not dreamlike and only the hotel
dream looked cool. Cobb&#x27;s wife was so annoying that I wanted to pull my
arm out and constantly bash my head with it. There were so many
unanswered questions like what year is the movie set in? Why does Cobb
steal ideas and now he has to plant one? It was 2.5 hours long and they
still couldn&#x27;t explain anything.<br /><br />Inception isn&#x27;t even original it is ripped off from a Japanese animated
movie called &#x22;Paprika&#x22; which was out in 2006.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t know why it is #3 on the IMDb top 250 it is not a visionary
masterpiece or anything and it is only about 80% on rotten tomatoes and
there are many great movies with 90+% on rotten tomatoes and they are
not on the top 250 like Run Lola Run.<br /><br />It is nothing but an over hyped movie and the film makers must of
written that &#x22;Inception is good&#x22; on a piece of paper and planted it in
people&#x27;s mind although it&#x27;s not.
