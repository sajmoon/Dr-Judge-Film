Woohhh....What can i say...???Just feeling so excited..actually &#x22;Goose-
bumped&#x22; to see this movie...Have lost the count abt the number of times
i just used the word &#x22;brilliant&#x22; and &#x22;awesome&#x22; or clapped during this
movie...Christopher Nolan.Can&#x27;t get enuf words of praises for this
genius..First came following,memento,prestige,batman and then dark
knight...All of us thought he reached his creative epitome with Dark
Knight...But with INCEPTION he proved us how wrong we are.Changing the
whole concept of dreaming...he takes us into a world..a world where
anything is possible..and to Star in this LEGEND what better option
other than the MIGHTY DICAPRIO ..who just returns after basking in
success of Shutter island...Ken Watanabe(again brilliant..after Last
Samurai) offers caprio and his company to incept an idea in a
billionaire&#x27;s heir to break his father&#x27;s empire...wat follows after is
arrangement of a team and a wonderful story.....Page(Juno),gordon
levitt(500 days of summer) doing an excellent job...and cotillard
providing an excellent assistance....Wonderful Screenplay,Excellent
background score by Hans Zimmer,Action Scenes awesomely sequenced(watch
out for zero gravity action scenes.. :) ) and finally (i m again saying
it) CHRISTOPHER NOLAN...who dreamed it so big.... :) and made it such a
surreal experience...Sheer Genius..Two thumbs up from me....Surely not
the one to miss...VERY VERY Strongly recommended....
