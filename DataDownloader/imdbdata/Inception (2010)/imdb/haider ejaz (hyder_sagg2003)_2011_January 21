Disappointed, Oh yes I am Disappointed. Why, Because I had high
expectations. Why I had High Expectations? Because Nolan&#x27;s History of
Film making was what I was confident about. Memento, The Dark Knight
are the two Movies which got a 10/10 and 9/10 rating from me
respectively. But Inception, It was neither Memento, Nor The Dark
Knight. It was more of a screenplay forcing you to believe it and to
make it look genuine BUT with flawed ways and formulaic techniques
which didn&#x27;t work for me.Other than that it was fine. Visuals,
Performances, Editing were all fine and the Camera Used for the movie
was not the perfect choice. Direction as usual was POWERFUL but it was
the story that didn&#x27;t really appealed me.<br /><br />It is a movie with fine content but a forcing (in a wrong way) story.
6/10. And I am not crying its over-rated since most of people have
really liked it.
