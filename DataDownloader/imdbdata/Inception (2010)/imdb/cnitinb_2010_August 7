An extractor is person who can steal your &#x22;subconscious idea&#x22;. Its a
world where you can enter, exit and connect the dreams of you and
others. An architect is required to &#x22;build&#x22; the settings around in a
dream, a &#x22;forger&#x22; can shape shift into a known person in your dream, a
&#x22;kick&#x22; or a violent stimulus is required to pull you out of a dream and
finally a quaint object like a top is called a &#x22;totem&#x22;, a device that
helps to distinguish dream and reality, a device that keeps you sane.
WOW! Welcome to the world of &#x22;Inception&#x22; created by a genius called
Christopher Nolan. <br /><br />The movies starts off with an intriguing scene that forms a part of the
climax and then flashes back to the past. All the concepts stated above
is explained wasting no time as the plot proceeds, resulting in a
smooth and a superb narrative that has you hooked. <br /><br />This time an extractor called Cobb has to plant an idea into a company
heir-Fischer(Murphy), to dissolve his company. cobbs is aided by
Arthur(Levitt), Ariadne(Page) the architect and Eames(Hardy)a forger,
Yusuf(Rao) in charge of sedation and their recruiter Saito(Watanabe).
What follows is their pulse racing adventure into 4 levels of dreams
i.e dreams within dreams in order to achieve what was though to be
impossible-An &#x27;Inception&#x27;. Trying to stop this mission are the
&#x27;military projections&#x27; of Fischer, that are like &#x22;white Blood cells&#x22;
trying to kill the &#x27;foreign bodies&#x27; that are saito&#x27;s crew. Also Mal
Cobb, Cobb&#x27;s dead wife haunts his memory threatening to make the entire
mission an epic fail. Cobb needs to complete the mission but to do so
he also needs to end his inner demons of guilt associated with his
personal life. <br /><br />The CGI is breathtaking and completely appropriate, the actors all do a
fine job and DiCaprio gives one of the best performances of his
carrier. Some Parts of the plot aren&#x27;t easily understood. They are like
a puzzle you know you will solve if u have just give another try.
Basically it&#x27;s a movie that does something that others rarely do...it
makes you think! <br /><br />In conclusion, Inception is a classic no doubt, its so wickedly clever
and unique that you will be proud you liked it.
