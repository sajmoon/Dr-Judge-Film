My wife and i watched this movie in the cinema and we are glad that we
did this, because the movie has a lot of visual effect that looks
better on a big screen. The movie has a very original story line that
we liked very much. You have to pay attention watching this movie,
because it can be somewhat complex. But we followed it without any
problem. It has some comparison with the movie &#x27;The Matrix&#x27;. Also a
very great movie by the way. We would recommend this movie with
Leonardo too everybody! It&#x27;s better to watch this on a big screen, you
will be surprised for sure! And Leonardo is on the map again showing
very good acting performance!
