Inception is without a doubt a movie unlike any other: the reason I
believe this to be true is not in its complicated plot structure but in
the way a story, so original and so full of action, love and intellect
is told to us. Each character serves a purpose, especially Cobb and
Ariadne who help us understand this world where dream invasion is
possible, and this happens in such a way, that not unlike Ellen Page&#x27;s
character we feel drawn to this world and this is probably one of the
main reasons this film will stay with you, in your mind, maybe even in
your dreams like a simple idea planted in you. As previously stated
this movie is unlike any other also because it is very difficult to
categorize. It has been said that Inception is confusing and I see how
this can be partly true, the plot is not straightforward forcing the
viewer to think and not just watch the actions and especially words of
the characters. Yes Inception is a complicated movie but one that if
understood and followed until the (uncertain) end rewards you with
something that no other movie could. Nolan managed to create his first
real masterpiece, one that to me changes everything, first of all the
way I watch and look at movies. So if somewhere in your town Inception
is still playing and you have some time to use (and not waste) go watch
it and you will not regret it. <br /><br />10/10
