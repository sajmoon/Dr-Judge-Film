This is not a bad film per se, had it been about 30-40 minutes shorter
I would not have been too offended. But I am genuinely perplexed as to
how people can rave over it - #13 on all time list at time of writing!!
There is virtually no character development, the plot is overly
complicated and riddled with holes and contradictions. Frankly you
don&#x27;t need to suspend disbelief so much has have it surgically removed
and flushed down the toilet. By the end I was wishing I was in a dream
within a dream policed by a completely arbitrary set of nonsense rules
- anything to get me out of that chair.<br /><br />Is this really the same man who gave us Memento??
