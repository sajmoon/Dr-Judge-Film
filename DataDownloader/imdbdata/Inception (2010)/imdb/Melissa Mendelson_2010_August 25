Where do we go when we dream? What world waits to take us in, and what
secrets remain hidden, locked beyond our reach? What truth must be
denied, and if reality breaks, how do we know if we are awake? What if
we can&#x27;t escape our ghosts, and what if we can&#x27;t leave them behind? Our
lives are intricate webs woven over time, but time is a dream lingering
across oblivion. And as we dive deeper, plunge down into the fabric of
our being, what will we find, and could we ever go home again? Is life
nothing but what we imagine, decorated with hopes and darkened with
fears, and what if the storm rises to engulf all that we are? What
would be left behind? Our hearts hold the truth, the memories that beat
inside, and the sands of chaos overlap the waves of destiny, chasing
footprints left beside waking lives that drift across the dream scape.
