2010_July 27 
Whilst some people seem intent on classing this film alongside such
eternal duds as &#x27;Street Fighter&#x27; or &#x27;Honey I Sold the Kids&#x27; (made up) I
would like to offer a different angle. Yes, Inception is sometimes
overly complex, sometimes cut a little too quickly together at the
start of the film for the average film-goer to follow, but surely
sometimes we don&#x27;t want to be treated like kids. I for one was a little
lost at the beginning but held on to the faith that the film would turn
the corner and drop the cerebral musings for intelligent entertainment.
I was not left dangling. However, to label this film &#x27;drivel&#x27; and Mr
Nolan &#x27;disappearing up his own a*se&#x27; is frankly an explanation in
itself as to why those people didn&#x27;t enjoy the film. Yes everyone is
entitled to their own opinion but why to people always insist on
venting their hate of a film? You didn&#x27;t like it? OK, great. Go and see
something else next time. But don&#x27;t bother us with your &#x27;letter to the
director&#x27; moanings. The film is well shot, eye-opening (reminds me of
the first time I saw The Matrix and it&#x27;s fight scenes) and ultimately,
no matter how confusing some of the movie might have been, leaves you
with an ending that so few films these days have the nuts to try.
&#x27;Se7en&#x27; was one, a film that didn&#x27;t give you a gift-wrapped conclusion.
Something that makes you walk out of the cinema and still want to talk
it through with someone. So, to those people who HATE this film, think
Nolan has played with too many toys, I say appreciate this film for
what it is; a refreshingly entertaining take on an old-ish concept.
Full of visual delight and intellect yet prepared to be balls-out
action too.
