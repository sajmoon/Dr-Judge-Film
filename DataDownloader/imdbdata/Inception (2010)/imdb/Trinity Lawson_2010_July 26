I went to see this film with the highest of expectations, it surpassed
them by light years! This movie was written brilliantly, directed
brilliantly, acted brilliantly, it was brilliant. The story is amazing,
keeping you enthralled every second, and sometimes a little confused,
but that adds to the experience. The ideas put forward in the film
exceed most realms of the reality we have learned to accept. The
performances from Marion Cottillard and Ellen Page in particular were
exquisite. It&#x27;s a visual delight at all times and leaves you wanting to
see it again and again. For anyone who loves a good story with some
action and adventure thrown in, go see Inception, a fantastic movie,
deserving of it&#x27;s reputation.
