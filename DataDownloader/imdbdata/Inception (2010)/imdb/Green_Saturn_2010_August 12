I&#x27;m not really sure what I should be saying about this movie. It was...
different. Not in a bad way, but it was different. I definitely liked
it. ...Hmm. I&#x27;ve never had to think this hard about what to write in a
review!<br /><br />First, I&#x27;d like to say that the soundtrack for this is probably my
favorite (soundtrack, that is). It truly accentuates the emotions that
the actors show. You feel the excitement from &#x27;Mombasa&#x27;, the pain in
&#x27;Old Souls&#x27; and... I don&#x27;t really know what emotion I felt, but &#x27;Time&#x27;
is definitely the crown jewel. You definitely get that, &#x22;Aw, what? It
can&#x27;t end here!&#x22; feeling when the movie ends, and I&#x27;d say that without
&#x27;Time&#x27;, the movie just wouldn&#x27;t have had such an exciting ending. Hans
Zimmer brought out the big guns for this film.<br /><br />The idea that you can do crazy things with your mind has been around
forever, but I don&#x27;t think the idea that you can control your dreams
has ever been explored. Originality is sparse at the movie theaters,
but every so often something like &#x27;Inception&#x27; comes around and makes
you realize just how awesome movies are. I kept thinking I had a grasp
of what would happen next to the characters, then the complete opposite
would happen. &#x27;Inception&#x27; leaves you begging for more, yet begging for
the action and suspense to end!<br /><br />Would this film have worked without Leo DiCaprio? Probably not. He was
the perfect choice for his role. I don&#x27;t really know how to explain
this, but I was cheering him on the entire time, even though a lot of
the group&#x27;s problems came from his unconscious. I know that&#x27;s
confusing, but that&#x27;s what makes this movie so great. You&#x27;re completely
lost the entire time, then at the very end you realize that you knew
everything the entire time!<br /><br />I know this review is confusing. I never said I expected this to be my
best review. Reviewing skills aside, this is a movie you NEED to see.
Trust me!
