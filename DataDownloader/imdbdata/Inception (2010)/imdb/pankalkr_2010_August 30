As a film-goer, it feels great not to be underestimated. It doesn&#x27;t
happen very often, but you can trust Christopher Nolan not to do it
once. Although I&#x27;m not someone who watches films because of their
director, I was and will be willing to make an exception with Nolan -
especially after Batman Begins and, more importantly, The Dark Knight.
Inception had all the elements which enthralled me with Nolan&#x27;s
previous work: the enjoyably intricate plot, great pacing and faith in
storytelling instead of special effects (although, in this case, the
fantastic effects were there to support the narrative).<br /><br />I love the fact that the film lacks stock characters, and that the
focus of the film stays on the inception mission throughout the film
instead of slipping to trite plot &#x22;twists&#x22; in order to draw audience.
That is so hard to come by, and I always appreciate it. Inception
doesn&#x27;t offer easy solutions and let the viewer just sit there and take
it all in.<br /><br />The cast was, needless to say, superb. I was a bit prejudiced against
DiCaprio as I had had enough of him already during the Titanic era, but
in Inception, he was terrific, very intense. As for the female leads,
Cotillard and Page, I have nothing but praise. They were not cast for
their sex appeal, which I don&#x27;t mean as an euphemism for
unattractiveness - they were there for their powerful presence and
credibility, which is, again, rare and goes to show that this film has
more than just superficial potential. Funnily enough, a day before
seeing Inception I watched the 90&#x27;s teen comedy 10 Things I Hate About
You, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I&#x27;m so glad to see him back on
screen in this great company.<br /><br />I went to see this film with my father who&#x27;s very rarely impressed by
films not regarded as &#x27;classics&#x27;, and very refrained from praise. His
first word after the Inception screening was &#x27;breathtaking.&#x27; I was
completely quiet on the way home, and by the time I got there, my
thoughts raced with acclaim and I had already adopted the film to my
Top 5 list and Nolan as one of my favorite directors. Inception is a
film that you can&#x27;t leave at the movie theater, because you know that
you have just seen a future classic.
