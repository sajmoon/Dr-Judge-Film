Nolan may possibly be one of the best new directors to be rising into
the Hollywood scene, considering he&#x27;s slowly becoming a household name
with the reboot of the Batman series. It&#x27;s rare to find a filmmaker who
brings something fresh into the scene with every movie he releases, and
while he&#x27;s far from perfect, Inception is his best work to date, next
to his semi-independent film Momento.<br /><br />Inception is a movie that comes around once in awhile that really sends
you on a thrill ride of visual effects and gun fights, while
simultaneously keeping you enthralled in a storyline that has been well
fleshed out throughout the first and second acts, and concluded in a
way that, as long as you had paid attention, leaves you fulfilled and
satisfied. Unlike Dicaprio&#x27;s previous film, Shutter Island, which makes
you feel as if a potentially awe-inspiring story was just cut too short
and given a generic, Shaymalan style twist.<br /><br />Nolan&#x27;s masterpiece (and yes, it is a masterpiece) is about a group of
James-bond like characters who are able to infiltrate a person&#x27;s dream
through a specific kind of technology and steal ideas (usually in a
symbolic safe and represented as paper). Leonardo Dicaprio plays the
leader archetype, whose subconscious is unstable due to a past
experience with his wife. Ellen Page is brought on the team to become
the Architect of the dreams, and steadily becomes the voice of reason
for Dicaprio&#x27;s troubled character. What makes the film especially great
is that there is no unnecessary, sporadic romance played off the
generic Hollywood clich&#xE9;s that audiences will despise a movie without
sex or love involved.<br /><br />The ending may throw you for a loop, but you&#x27;ll either make up your own
decision about it&#x27;s meaning or just take it as it comes. Either way,
the movie is a fabulous example of intelligent blockbuster movies, and
does an excellent job balancing story and character development with
action and visual effects. And, by the way, the action scenes are
pretty badass.<br /><br />My final word to you is to see this movie, pay attention, and be
amazed.
