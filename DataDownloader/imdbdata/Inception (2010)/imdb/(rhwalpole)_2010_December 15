My wife and I sat down to watch this on Sky HD in eager anticipation
given the rave reviews it has been receiving from the critics and on
IMDb. How disappointed we were. In our opinion, and the one star review
given is an average of our two scores, rounded up to the minimum
allowed of one, this has to be one of the worst films ever made. We
cannot see any merit in it, on any level, from any aspect. I am not
going to give away any of the film other than to say that it is
nonsense from beginning to end, and when we say nonsense, that is not
because we did not understand it. We understood what was happening, but
all the time there was an air of absolute disbelief that anyone could
consider this tripe to be entertaining. We watched it all the way to
the end just to see what would would happen. We should have given up
after five minutes as we considered and watched some snow melt in our
garden!
