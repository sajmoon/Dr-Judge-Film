Wow. Words cannot describe how jaw-droopingly BRILLIANT this film is.
Everything about this movie is perfect. The depth, the running time,
the soundtrack. Just, WOW.<br /><br />This film is a modern masterpiece, no doubt. Christopher Nolan has done
it again, and delivered a truly epic movie! Twice in a row. Clearly
inspired by the Bond series, this IS Nolans Bond film. I really do hope
he directs Bond 23 as well, because after tonight, this man can pull
anything off. <br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio is fantastic! I&#x27;ve developed quite a liking for this
guy lately. He&#x27;s evolved from the cutey in Titanic to a fully
established actor, who can do anything, take on so many different roles
and be totally convincing in anything he does. <br /><br />The action scenes are spot on as well. Not only can Nolan direct in
such a brilliant fashion, he can also find the perfect mix between
drama and action. Which is fantastic. <br /><br />This movie deserves full marks. It&#x27;s enjoyable, entertaining and so
intriguing. A perfect mix between drama, suspense and action. Well done
Mr Nolan.
