The movie opens with a teaser scene at a seaside Japanese castle and we
know we&#x27;ll return to this scene (bookends) at the end of the film, 2
and 1/2 hours later. This period of time is not unlike swimming
underwater from one end of a pool (opening scene) to the other end of
the pool (return to same scene). Sure the pool has some heavy orchestra
music pumped into it, that by film&#x27;s end becomes a croaking brass band
that you&#x27;re not sure is a surface foghorn or a submarine&#x27;s dive
warning, but you&#x27;re never given a break from the plot/action to catch
your breath and acquaint yourself with the characters.<br /><br />The &#x22;mysteries&#x22; about Leo&#x27;s wife are not difficult to figure out, but
why he is so devoted to this pseudo-serial killer is.<br /><br />And I&#x27;m sorry, but I can&#x27;t get worked up over Leo&#x27;s faceless kids.<br /><br />I found Leo&#x27;s status as an internationally most-wanted fugitive hard to
swallow, as well as Watanabe&#x27;s omnipotence.<br /><br />And I can&#x27;t be the only one that had trouble understanding Watanabe
when his face was in the carpeting or when he was talking to the French
actor. Strong accents.<br /><br />I had to come up for air after the 1 hour mark because that level of
intensity isn&#x27;t sustainable and I only occasionally dipped my head
beneath the surface for short periods, thereafter.<br /><br />I will give kudos to Gordon-Levitt for putting up with all of the
flying-harness stunt work which served the ooh/aah factor more than the
story. And he would be the best choice if a biopic is ever done on John
Carradine.<br /><br />When the credits do finally scroll, you&#x27;ll have to decide if all of
your attention and brain drain was worth it because it&#x27;s questionable
whether the director feels you deserve an ending.
