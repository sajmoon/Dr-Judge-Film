Christopher Nolan has undoubtedly become one of the most important
names in the business of contemporary filmed entertainment.He has taken
us to places we did not know existed.He singlehandedly revived a
languishing cartoon franchise and placed it in the pantheon of
unforgettable classics. In his new adventure he takes on the uncharted
universe of the subconscious. The premise in its scope is intriguing
and unconceivable ambitious.he relies on the best movie making talent
only a major movie studio can buy to achieve his goal.The special
effects are terrific, the acting is pretty good, and the dialogue is
also good, but the journey that started as an unrestrained adventure
into the realms of the human thought generating universe turned half
way thru into a tale of semi confusing scenes. The story never comes
anywhere near of seducing its audience. The emotional factor is
completely absent.The movie is worth watching and it does stand out
mostly due to lack of quality competition, but it should not be an
Oscar nominee. Christopher Nolan has done better work.
