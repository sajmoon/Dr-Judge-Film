This is a tedious and boring movie that begs you to NOT suspend your
disbelief and, instead, to wad up your popcorn bag and throw it at the
screen. Okay, I exaggerate a little. But... <br /><br />Read the insightful reviews dated 19 July: You Don&#x27;t Get It. And 20
July: Boring, Too Long, Awful Dialogue. And 21 July: Not Bad But
Definitely Not Genius. And 29 July: Dumb, Dumb, Dumb. And finally, for
a little fun, 23 July: Blah. <br /><br />Rather than rehash the insights of those helpful reviews, I&#x27;ll try to
add something useful...<br /><br />Inside of 30 minutes I was squirming in my seat, tapping my fingers,
and checking my watch. Why? No character development. No sense that a
good story had been started. And thus no engagement. As time wore on I
found I really didn&#x27;t care about any of the characters, or their
plights, or what they were trying to accomplish, other than thinking
Ellen Page was kind of cute.<br /><br />In an EW interview, Nolan says about his film, Memento, that he was
&#x22;trying to transcend the tyranny of linear narrative.&#x22; Really? A
tyranny? We live in a linear narrative, Chris, but now that I know you
feel that way about life, I&#x27;ll remember not to pay to see your films.
In the same interview, Nolan says that he was worried that his audience
wouldn&#x27;t be able to follow his brain-bending movie because of the
complex dream-within-a-dream plot... until he lit upon (drum roll) the
&#x22;heist-flick model,&#x22; in which the hero-thieves explain their scheme.
Yes, Chris, but that&#x27;s not a very good model. And what&#x27;s more, it only
works if the &#x22;explaining is minimal&#x22; and the director is skilled enough
to show and reveal more. It&#x27;s a moving picture, remember? <br /><br />Yes, the action here is pretty cool, better than the Dark Knight. The
camera and stunt work are very good. The music is the same gloomy
heavy-handed kind used in Dark Knight (same composer, Hans Zimmer). But
the characters are essentially two-dimensional because everything is
secondary to the plot, which in spite of its complexity you can
understand well enough because it&#x27;s all explained to you, endlessly.
Even Dicaprio wasn&#x27;t happy with his character and worked with Nolan for
two months &#x22;adding layers&#x22; for more emotional depth (see the Rolling
Stone interview). But apparently the complexity and ridiculousness of
the plot buried that, or Nolan just didn&#x27;t know how to deliver it (come
to think of it, this may be a problem with all of his films). Plot over
character. Cool factor over emotion. <br /><br />You think of the great work DiCaprio did in The Aviator. And the
brilliant work by Gordon-Levitt in The 500 Days of Summer. I wasn&#x27;t
much of a fan of Juno, but Ellen Page &#x22;made&#x22; that movie. And of course
Michael Caine has made many great movies, including the recent Harry
Brown. Also, Ken Watanabe in The Last Samurai. And finally, let&#x27;s not
forget Marion Cotillard&#x27;s stunning Oscar-winning performance in La Vie
En Rose. But they&#x27;re all struggling mightily here with Nolan&#x27;s tedious
script, and their immense talent is wasted.<br /><br />But of course, I&#x27;m all wrong. The movie is a huge hit. It&#x27;s sure to
rack up $500 million or more in worldwide box office sales. Whew!
That&#x27;s good news. Because then Nolan can go on &#x22;transcending the
tyranny.&#x22;
