Christopher Nolan is fastly becoming one of my favorite directors. I&#x27;ve
loved all of his movies so far and I&#x27;ve been eagerly awaiting his
follow up to The Dark Knight since I came across the in-production page
for this movie online, probably a year ago or more. Now after having
just returned from the theater, I must say I was met with some mixed
feelings about it. My feelings are certainly much more positive than
they are negative. It is safe to say right off the bat that the movie
was indeed very good. But I think it fell just slightly short of the
hopes that I had for it.<br /><br />Now maybe my expectations are set a little too high. It is perhaps
unfair to expect any movie to be a perfect ten before you see it. But
it&#x27;s hard not to with many of the critics hailing this film as a
masterpiece. I think with Inception, all of the pieces of a well above
average, even excellent movie are there. An imaginative, very original
concept, a well-written, believable, and deep script, good characters
with good performances all around, adept directing, and exciting action
scenes with breathtaking visual effects. I just personally feel that
it&#x27;s lacking a few ingredients to elevate it to the status of a true
masterpiece.<br /><br />So I&#x27;ll start with the positives. Many parts of this movie are really
quite brilliant. The storyline is extremely imaginative, and in much of
the movie a treat to watch unfold on screen. I think that with one of
Hollywood&#x27;s biggest issues being derivative plot-lines and unoriginal
ideas, this movie really stands out as a unique idea and an original
film. Not only is the idea unique but it is also a deep plot-line.
Sometimes it&#x27;s a little hard to follow what&#x27;s happening for a moment or
two, but it&#x27;s generally well executed in that I never felt completely
lost for a significant amount of time.<br /><br />the technical aspects of the film are top-notch. The action scenes are
exciting and well directed, and the special effects are brilliant.
Another excellent aspect of this movie that doesn&#x27;t always show up
quite as much in action movies anymore, due to the use of CGI, is some
excellent stunt-work. The special effects work very well in this movie
to give you a truly larger than life feel. Whether it&#x27;s the greatest
movie of all time or not, when you watch this film you know you are
witnessing something much bigger than yourself.<br /><br />The acting is also very good across the board. I am personally a huge
fan of Leonardo Dicaprio, but I was disappointed by both of his last
two films, so I was very happy to see him give an excellent performance
in this legitimately awesome movie. His character is quite deep and has
some monster-sized demons, and he plays it very convincingly. I also
quite like most of the other actors in this movie, and I can honestly
say everyone involved did a good job. I don&#x27;t necessarily think any of
it will be Oscar material, but they got into their characters well and
were believable and entertaining.<br /><br />All that being said, my main problem with this movie was the pacing.
While being exciting and fun in many ways, the entire thing also seemed
very heavy-handed. The script contained a lot of emotion, which in
general is a good thing, but sometimes I felt that the emotion served
to weigh it down rather than to bring the intensity of the movie up to
that next level. It also felt too drag on a little too long near the
ending. All of the scenes serve a purpose in the movie and perhaps are
necessary to tell the story that Nolan was going for, but it seemed
that there could have been some more effective way to arrange them to
make the movie flow just a little more fluidly. It&#x27;s hard to explain
without giving anything away but let&#x27;s just say there were a few scenes
that I thought slowed the film down and distracted from the central
plot-line.<br /><br />The climactic final act of the movie is brilliantly layered in several
ways, but sometimes the layers work against each other. The film
involves multiple plot-lines, and at times it seemed to leave one plot
behind for a while in favor of another. It&#x27;s obvious that a lot of
thought went into constructing this movie, almost like constructing an
elaborate dream world, but ultimately I think the plot of the movie
weighs itself down a little.<br /><br />The TV spots for the film have been describing it as The Matrix meets
James Bond. While I think the Matrix comparison is very accurate, I
think it lacks a little bit of the overall cool-ness of James Bond in
favor of a more heavy, emotional tone. Of course whether that&#x27;s a good
or a bad thing is subject to opinion. Another discrepancy I had about
it is how to feel about one very specific, manipulative moment in the
film but saying anything further on it involves a spoiler so I&#x27;ll stop
there.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t get me wrong. This is without a doubt one of, if not the, most
imaginative and creative sci-fi action films since The Matrix. But I do
not think that it is Christopher Nolan&#x27;s masterpiece. There is a lot to
praise here, but also room for improvement. I think it&#x27;s a masterpiece
concept that wasn&#x27;t quite perfected. A little smoothing of the edges
and adjustments to the pacing and it could have been a truly incredible
film across the board. As it is, I still say it&#x27;s a great ride that you
won&#x27;t want to miss. ********1/2- 8.5/10
