I sat through the whole thing without the least idea of what was going
on. It seemed like an endless string of herky-jerky, two second scenes
with next to nothing to connect them. Lots of guns and explosions for
those who like fireworks, but the plot was invisible. None of the
characters provoked even the mildest of interest from me. Clearly, a
lot of money was spent on special effects, but because something can be
done doesn&#x27;t mean it should be. While I am not a writer, I seem to
remember that a story should have an arc. There was nothing like that
here - only a bunch of random dots. Overall, a total mess. Don&#x27;t waste
your money. Minus 5 stars.
