Now before I start I want to make one thing clear, I am not I die hard
Nolan Fan. I thought that his two Batman Movies were good, but over
rated, and I have only seen one other film. Memento is still my
favorite, but Inception comes very, very close.<br /><br />I would describe the plot, but I can&#x27;t really do it. It&#x27;s so jumbled
and crazy that no one can really describe other than Nolan. From what I
get, Cobb is a man who can enter people&#x27;s dreams, and now must implant
an idea into a CEO&#x27;s son&#x27;s head.<br /><br />Believe me this movie is a lot more than just that. Including a subplot
with Cobb&#x27;s wife. By the end all the pieces came together and my mind
was blown away the same way it was in Memento.<br /><br />I love this movie, but I will not renounce my religion and join the
Church of Nolan.
