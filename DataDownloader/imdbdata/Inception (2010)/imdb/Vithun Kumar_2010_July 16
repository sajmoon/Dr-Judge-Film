This is one movie where you can write a review and there is very less
chance that it would contain spoilers. There is so much in the movie,
that it cannot be revealed in a single short review. All I can say is
that it is one of the must watch movies ever, especially for those who
like intense movies: the types which require the viewer to stay focused
throughout. Everything about the movie is near perfect. The story (the
writing deserves a special mention), the direction and the performances
especially from Leo everything contribute in making the movie
thoroughly enjoyable. The reason I have given a 9 instead of 10 is that
for some reason I could not continue thinking a lot about the movie
once I came out of it. There are a lot of movies which stay with you
for a long time after you watch it, and they go on to be termed
&#x22;great&#x22;. This for some reason didn&#x27;t do that, but I seriously enjoyed
it as long as it lasted, with no dull moment, and I would recommend it
to everyone. This is Nolan&#x27;s best so far, and I hope he continues
outdoing himself. And he is definitely my favourite director now!
