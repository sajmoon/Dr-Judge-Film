2010_September 29 
I went to the cinema thinking I might not understand it, that feeling
got reinforced at the start of the movie, but by the end of it, I
understood fully what had happened(you&#x27;ll see what I mean), I actually
had to explain to my mum what was this or that. When the first credits
appeared and people were getting out of the cinema, everyone had their
faces all strange, as if they might be dreaming, that was the exact
feeling I had myself. If you&#x27;ve seen matrix and thought it was good,
please see this, you&#x27;ll realize matrix was crap. The acting was pretty
good, and I thought Leonardo Di Caprio was really involved in the film.
There is some of the typical American idea of love, and I guess that
there might be some things that don&#x27;t really make sense, but apart from
that the movie was great. Don&#x27;t take too little kids, &#x27;cause I guess
they might get disappointed, but you can perfectly consider taking kids
that are 13 or 14( I know it because I am one).
