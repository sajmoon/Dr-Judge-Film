To be honest, I&#x27;m kind of upset that this movie came out. The reason:
I&#x27;m an aspiring filmmaker and have always wanted to make a movie about
dreams. I used to say to myself, &#x22;Everyone will be so impressed because
no one else has made a movie about dreams! I&#x27;ll be the first!&#x22;<br /><br />Well, then along came Chris Nolan. Now, the real reason I&#x27;m upset is
not necessarily because he made a movie about dreams, but because he
made it SO DANG EPIC.<br /><br />So yeah, after seeing it for the first time, I was all like, &#x22;That dude
stole my idea.&#x22; But after awhile, I accepted the hard truth that being
born in 1995 means most of the good ideas will be taken by the time I
actually have the chance to make movies for myself. Once I had that
issue settled, it all became clear to me. THIS MOVIE ROCKS.<br /><br />I probably couldn&#x27;t have done it better myself. It&#x27;s got that thrilling
feeling that just takes hold of you and doesn&#x27;t let go. Even after the
movie&#x27;s over, it&#x27;s still got you. If you have any intelligent,
inquiring mind at all, you&#x27;ll be up all night thinking about it. It&#x27;s
the kind of movie that keeps you thinking. <br /><br />That being said, you actually have to think while watching it. Now, I
know plenty of people who watch movies for the heck of it and just lay
back and get spoon-fed everything they need to know. Not the case in
this movie. If you don&#x27;t pay attention, or if you block out the dialog
and wait for the action, you&#x27;ll be lost. Hopelessly lost. The movie
will get over and you&#x27;ll be all like, &#x22;That wuz a rele stoopid, randum,
konfuoosing movee and it mayde my smaull brane hert.&#x22;<br /><br />I&#x27;ve watched movies like these with people like that, sadly. <br /><br />Anyway, if you pay attention and use your mind while watching it, it is
so worth it. And the great part is, it doesn&#x27;t get old after the
second, third, or fourth time! There&#x27;s always something new you can
pick up when watching it again. It&#x27;s definitely not one of those movies
you just watch once and say, &#x22;Well, that was nice.&#x22; It&#x27;s one of those
movies that&#x27;ll be a defining classic of our generation and one that
will continue to impact the world for generations to come. Congrats
Chris Nolan, on taking the dream I had and making it your own fabulous
reality. I&#x27;ll do better anyway. Haha.<br /><br />So, if you haven&#x27;t seen it yet, get your butt to the nearest rental
store (please don&#x27;t be lazy by getting it off your TV), and watch
Inception! A movie lover will not be disappointed. <br /><br />With love, <br /><br />Simba Jackson
