2010_July 21 
My wife and I went to this movie with high expectations. Unfortunately,
I relied too heavily on the critics and IMDb&#x27;s rating. The acting was
good which would normally mean a higher rating, but I disliked this
movie so much, I couldn&#x27;t give it higher than one star.<br /><br />The theory of the movie is complicated and, I believe, not well
explained. By the end, which I thought would never come, I felt I
understood the basics but not much more (maybe my wife and I are just
to dumb to grasp the intricacies).<br /><br />Some of the special effects were excellent, but for the most part they
went on way to long. A good editing job could have eliminate enough to
get the film below 2 hours. Many of the action scenes in the snow could
have been eliminated altogether<br /><br />My wife and I are retired and go to a lot of movies. We thoroughly
enjoyed Knight and Day which has only grossed $70 million but avoided
like the plague the newer movie Grown Ups which has already grossed
over $130 million. It&#x27;s unfortunate, but stupid is in.<br /><br />When you see so many movies like we do your requirements may be higher.
I want a reasonably good story, good acting, and a entertaining
experience. We loved Hangover, Kick-Ass, and Toy Story 3. There was
quality and entertainment in each. Except for the special effects, I
can&#x27;t say the same about Inception.
