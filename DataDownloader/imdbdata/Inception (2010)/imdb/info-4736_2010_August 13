I mean that figuratively and literally. First because this film doesn&#x27;t
deserve being that much praised (#3 best movie??!! - Matrix was way
better, for example), second because, just as the unwatchable The Dark
Knight, Nolan loves to have his movie filled with irritatingly loud
rumbling noise throughout, even in romantic/dramatic scenes! Why? Is
that to cover up the lack of real cinematic value and sustain the
artificial climax? Over such a long movie, you wanna kill yourself!<br /><br />Wait for the DVD/BluRay if only for the CG effects. Cause there&#x27;s
little else than that really. <br /><br />Probably the last time I go out to the movies.
