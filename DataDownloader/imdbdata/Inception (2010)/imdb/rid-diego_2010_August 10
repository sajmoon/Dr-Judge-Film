Many people may think: why to write the 1254th review of the same film?
Well, because something is needed to be pointed out: Inception is NOT
Paprika. I&#x27;ve seen both films recently (&#x22;Inception&#x22; just yesterday) and
its plot is completely different. Yes, they share the aspect that one
person can enter someone else&#x27;s dream (Paprika&#x27;s spoiler: and even
shared dreams to an extent) but the development, the goals of the
characters, the scenarios (not just the look, but its use) and the plot
are completely different. We&#x27;re facing two films with their respective
strengths and weaknesses. I think there&#x27;s so few left to speak about
Inception, but to say that everything on it was carefully designed and
filmed. It&#x27;s definitely the work of a genius that will stand a top with
others Sci-Fi genre classics. Keep up the great work Mr. Nolan. You&#x27;re
from now, my favorite director.
