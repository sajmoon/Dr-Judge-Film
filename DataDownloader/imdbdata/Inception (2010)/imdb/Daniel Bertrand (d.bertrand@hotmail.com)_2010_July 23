I&#x27;ve never written a review for any movie before and never really
intended too, but once I saw Inception I just had to express my
feelings on this movie.<br /><br />When I first saw the trailer for Inception I thought it looked good,
but not great. When the reviews came out and they were using words like
Genius and Masterpiece I thought a bit of an exaggeration. So clearly
when I went into Inception I wasn&#x27;t already in love with the movie
before even seeing it, to be honest I had my doubts. Obviously by the
title of my review I was clearly amazed by how good this movie was. I
cannot say this is the best movie of all time because I just believe it
is not possible to single out one movie out of all the movies that are
out there, but I can say that this is easily one of the greatest movies
ever made.<br /><br />I was very worried that the movie would be a little to complicated to
follow but that was not the case. Mr Nolan laid everything out quite
well for you to be able to follow the story.<br /><br />The movie has a running time of 2:30 hours and I never thought about
anything during that time besides what was on screen. It was intense,
fun, exciting, funny, smart and anything else you can think off all
wrapped into one movie. If you want to see a movie like you&#x27;ve never
seen before go see this movie. I have nothing bad to say about t and
will be going to see it again for a second time very soon.
