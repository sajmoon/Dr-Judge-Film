Like many others have said about this film is that its a complicated
plot but not that hard to follow or concentrate on. Leonardo Dicaprio
(Another actor in Lee&#x27;s top 10) is the star of the film in yet another
visual masterpiece from my new favourite director Christopher Nolan
(The Dark Knight) In this he portrays Cobb a Dream specialist who with
a team he personally assembled of other dream experts except jobs from
high rollers to either invade someone&#x27;s dreams and steal something per
say a combination to a safe that they only know etc etc. Or his team
can do Inception jobs, go in a person&#x27;s dreams and place an idea in
their minds for something that a person per say in the real world knows
they are capable of and just need a little push in the right direction.
Great stellar cast that is rounded off with Joseph Gordon Levitt, Ellen
Page, Ken Wantanabe and the always great Cillian Murphy.
