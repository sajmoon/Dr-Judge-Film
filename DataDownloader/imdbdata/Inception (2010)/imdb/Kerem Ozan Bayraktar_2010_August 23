I sadly decided to classify the audience of this movie after was
shocked that it is the 3th best movie on the list! 1. idiots: people
who doesn&#x27;t understand the concept of the movie and think this movie is
so complex for them. they are usually rom com lovers. 2. idiots who
think they are not: people who understand the movie and think this
movie is so deep and meaningful with their poor knowledge based on
pseudo intellectualism 3. idiots who watch this movie: people who is
like me try to don&#x27;t build barriers on Hollywood movies but usually get
disappointed. 4. smart guys: people who doesn&#x27;t care about this kind of
stuff.
