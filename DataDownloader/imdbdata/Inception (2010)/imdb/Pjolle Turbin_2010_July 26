This movie is not complicated. This movie is not complex. This movie is
an excellently acted excuse to put the most astounding weaving together
of action sequences ever performed on film.<br /><br />It&#x27;s mind-numbingly beautiful and if you ever saw an action movie you
liked, this movie is close to perfection. This movie is literally a
movie that will make you edge forward on your cinema seat and if you
feel you have outgrown action movies, then this flick will make you 12
again.<br /><br />The actors are good and they close together the gaps in the action
effectively and quickly. The cutting is probably the finest I have ever
seen, and the music orchestrates the events perfectly.<br /><br />See it!
