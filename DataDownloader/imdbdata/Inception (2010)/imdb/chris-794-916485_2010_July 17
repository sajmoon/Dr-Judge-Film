2010_July 17 
Really disappointing with a predictable ending.<br /><br />Far too long - lacked intelligence and little real depth.<br /><br />Derivative of 80&#x27;s movie Dreamscape and later The Matrix among others.<br /><br />Too much ego Nolan - nice technical effects but nothing new.<br /><br />A poor script however the acting was good. They managed to keep a
straight face throughout.<br /><br />As a connoisseur of sci fi movies in general it really didn&#x27;t hit the
mark, probably because it wanted to be a mainstream film.<br /><br />Could have done with at least 30 minutes cutting, the final third was
actually boring and the endless action sequences just became a blur.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t believe the hype - this is yet another summer &#x27;blockbuster&#x27; that
fails to hit the mark, although obviously better than Prince of Persia,
Airbender and the really garbage stuff.
