My interpretation of this is simple: Shutter Island meets Memento meets
Flatliners.<br /><br />I love to be challenged and this film doesn&#x27;t fail. It wasn&#x27;t until the
closing moments that everything fell into place; Leonardo Dicaprio&#x27;s
acceptance of a life in suspended limbo filled me with a sense of
peace. Wouldn&#x27;t we all abandon reality to capture a past happiness in
whatever form it may take? Once you strip back the complex story lines
and staggering visual graphics, the overall concept is pure spiritual
perfection. Be prepared to pay undivided attention and if possible,
watch the film a second time. I would recommend watching Shutter Island
prior to inception. Dicaprio fans will be satisfied; he has developed
into such a a strong film character who is capable of diversification.
Well done!
