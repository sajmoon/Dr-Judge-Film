Incredible movie -- We&#x27;ve seen it 3 times now and are still learning
new things. Does anyone think that all of Cobb&#x27;s team infiltrated HIS
dreams and that all of this (like Michael Douglas in the Game) is only
for Cobb&#x27;s sake, that the Ken W is only a player in the dream and that
his desire to take over the power company was planted the same way they
were planting things in Killian Murphy&#x27;s dream -- and that even the
Killian Murphy subplot was also a plant in Cobb&#x27;s head? Can&#x27;t wait till
this comes out on DVD so that we can study it further. Thought the snow
mountain scene went on too long, but was still way cool. The spinning
top in the end toppling reveals it&#x27;s not a dream -- at least that&#x27;s how
we interpreted it. But when&#x27;s the last time you saw a movie you then
discussed for days afterward?
