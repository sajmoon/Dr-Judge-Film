I&#x27;m not usually one for giving a 10 out of 10 mark, but having seen
Inception three times, i can definitely say it deserves full marks.
Having read the reviews on here, i&#x27;ve decided i&#x27;m not going to write a
synopsis since almost every other review has at least a simple summary. <br /><br />Many are a saying Inception was just boring; the characters didn&#x27;t mesh
well; it had so much potential; too much going on; too long; how can it
be 3&#x27;d best film ever, yada yada yada. I don&#x27;t agree with any in the
slightest. If you found it boring, then you didn&#x27;t grasp the whole
concept of the movie and the ideas it brought up.<br /><br />I first saw the trailer back in early July, was immediately intrigued
but went on holiday for 2 weeks. As i came back i learned it had been
on the Twitter trending topics the whole time i was away, so i decided
indefinitely that it was time i went and saw it myself. Having read an
extremely short synopsis saying &#x27;The film follows a man who steals, not
material objects, but ideas and dreams&#x27;, i didn&#x27;t know what to expect.
But it was more then i had ever imagined it to be.<br /><br />Not once did i look at my watch whilst in the screening. And if i did,
it was because i was checking how much longer was left as i didn&#x27;t want
it to end. The story i personally think is simple. It doesn&#x27;t take a
genius to work it out. But its the intelligence within it that&#x27;s
released from the the characters that make it what it is. Graphics are
brilliant, especially with buildings exploding here and there in slow
motion. Not over the top but without a doubt satisfying.<br /><br />I do have a soft spot for Ellen Page. Since i saw her in &#x27;Hard Candy&#x27;,
i&#x27;ve been intrigued in the work she chooses. She was beyond perfect for
the role of Ariadne; an innocent, dedicated student who definitely
helps the audience out with questions that needed answering. Leonardo
DiCaprio, perfection in all it&#x27;s glory. Perfect choice for Dom. The
cast as a whole was well put together. They each make their role their
own. I wouldn&#x27;t have chosen any better in all honesty.<br /><br />But i can write as much as i want trying to persuade you to give this
movie a chance regardless of some mindless people&#x27;s reviews. But the
decision does ultimately lie on your shoulders. Whether or not you
think you may enjoy this movie, i would give it a go in any case. You
may be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I adored the soundtrack to this movie. All orchestrated. Pure
brilliance. The impact it made on each scene was astounding. I highly,
highly, highly recommend you listen to it whether you decide to watch
the movie or not.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t think i can create a review that sums up it&#x27;s impact it had on
me. I could sit here and write all day how brilliant i thought it was
and talk about every minute detail that engrossed me, but then i would
be here all week. How do i bring this to a end though... An eventful,
non-stop, intelligent, incredible, jaw-droppingly, engrossing film,
with an ending that will leave you pulling your hair out and wanting
more. This is how i&#x27;d describe it. I do hope that they leave it at one
Inception though. Making a second one would ruin it entirely for me.
It&#x27;s always a tragic mistake.<br /><br />I must also add that it took me three viewings to finally suss out all
the characters names! Complicated in that aspect.
