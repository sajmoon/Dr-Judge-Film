Many things have already been said concerning &#x22;Inception,&#x22; so I&#x27;m going
to keep this short and focus on some things I haven&#x27;t seen mentioned
yet..<br /><br />The acting is flat-out incredible, with the exception of Leonardo
DiCaprio. Comparison with Keanu Reeves is becoming inevitable, what
with Leonardo&#x27;s &#x22;I can only look angry and confused&#x22;-style of acting.
Fortunately, Tom Hardy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt give such an impressive
performance that for once, I couldn&#x27;t be bothered by Leonardo&#x27;s
one-sidedness. Hardy in particular is a force of nature, with perfect
timing, inflection, emotion and humor. He&#x27;s amazing.<br /><br />This movie leaves pretty much the whole plot open to the viewer&#x27;s
imagination, which I find very appropriate taking in regard the subject
matter. The theories about this movie are diverse, which makes this a
powerful film even if you didn&#x27;t enjoy it. It&#x27;s food for thought, it&#x27;s
entertaining, it&#x27;s good, it&#x27;s visually stunning. I urge every film
lover to watch this.
