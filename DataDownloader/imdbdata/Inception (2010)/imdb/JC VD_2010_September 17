The story concept is a mixed of The Matrix (1999) + The Thirteenth
Floor (1999) + Dark City (1998) + Jacob&#x27;s Ladder (1990) ... <br /><br />The dream planting idea is from Paprika (2006) The multiple layers of
dream idea is from Perfect Blue (1998)<br /><br />It is a better movie than Shutter Island (2010), but doesn&#x27;t make it
worth all the buzz and box office success. Hollywood, just like any
other American culture, is suffocating from all the NWO agendas - thus
this mediocre sci-fi generated so much success compared to other &#x22;sugar
coated&#x22; movies that requires 0% of using your brain such as Scott
Pilgrim vs. the World (2010), Going the Distance (2010), ... all these
movies requires no imagination - pure visual receptions - just like
porn.<br /><br />Maybe that&#x27;s what the movie bosses want these days - further dumping
down the population till they have no intellect to speak their minds,
to think for themselves, just become a pack of sheep. <br /><br />If you are disappointed like me, go watch Perfect Blue (1998) Paprika
(2006) Esp the first one, the best psycho-thriller anime/film I&#x27;ve ever
seen
