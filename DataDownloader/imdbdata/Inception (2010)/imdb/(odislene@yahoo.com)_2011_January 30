This is one of the most interesting movies you will ever see. It has
great performances, starting with Dicaprio whom, from my standpoint, is
the actor that choose the best movies to be in nowadays. The theme is
completely outstanding. It&#x27;s well thought, it&#x27;s different, it keeps you
thinking, it keeps you guessing and if you loose only one minute of the
movie you&#x27;ll be lost. <br /><br />So, when you combine all what makes a movie a classic, one that will be
studied after ten years of release it, then you have to agree that the
directing work is magnificent and that&#x27;s what Christopher Nolan has
demonstrated in other movies (Batman, Memento), but specially in this
one with a such complicated script (also written by him).<br /><br />Don&#x27;t loose this movie, watch it more than once,watch it with company,
and I know for a fact that you won&#x27;t forget it and you&#x27;ll talk about it
for a long time.
