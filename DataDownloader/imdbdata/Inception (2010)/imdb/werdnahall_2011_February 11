Given it&#x27;s IMDb score, this is evidently close to a perfect movie in a
lot of people&#x27;s eyes. I can&#x27;t say I saw it that way. I watched this
moderately drunk. I was not able to keep up with all the plot
intricacies. Before angrily shouting at your screen that the
magnificent, air-tight intricacy was the whole point, let me just say
this: while on a second viewing I would undoubtedly &#x27;get it&#x27; more, and
be impressed the way it&#x27;s all built up and &#x27;works&#x27;, there would be a
few things holding it back for me. Certain things you&#x27;re still attuned
to, perhaps even sensitive to, drunk: namely, emotion. I didn&#x27;t feel
much of a hit on the emotional level. I didn&#x27;t feel I knew or cared
much about the characters. Little of the dialogue struck me as
memorable. These weren&#x27;t really the points of the movie. I get that.
But, for me at least, a movie needs the full palate to be truly great.
