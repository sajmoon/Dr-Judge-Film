To say Inception is good is an understatement. To say it is great is
more insulting than complimentary. This film comes closer to perfection
than possibly any movie I have ever seen. The story is flawless, the
acting phenomenal and the special effects are absolutely breathtaking.
Nolan wrote and directed an instant masterpiece with &#x22;Inception&#x22;. After
seeing the premiere, it didn&#x27;t surprise me at all to see it jump right
into the top 250, now sitting pretty at number 3. <br /><br />The movie centers around a technological advancement in science which
allows people to enter the human mind through dreaming. Through shared
dreaming, our main character Cobb(DiCaprio) enters the dreams of major
corporate entities to steal their most prized secrets. This maneuver is
called &#x22;extraction&#x22;, and starts the basis of the whole movie. While
Cobb is the best extractor there is, he is haunted by past issues which
ultimately prevents him from returning home to his family. Before he
can return home, Cobb is tasked with one last job that requires doing
the absolute impossible. &#x22;Inception&#x22;, which is the premise of the film,
requires a team of extraction specialists to enter someones mind and
plant a false idea. In the world of shared dreaming, this is considered
an almost impossible task. Without giving away too many details, Cobb
assembles a team of the very best to perform the task of inception. The
target is the son of a wealthy tycoon ready to inherit a fortune. <br /><br />If this sounds interesting to you, and it should, then do not hesitate
to see this film. The plot is very easy to follow, which allows all age
groups to enjoy this film. What makes it amazing, however, is the
complexities that the story holds. If you wish to dig deeper into
Inception you can, and will be delighted at the amount of sheer detail
Nolan included about his fantasy world. The idea of &#x22;dream sharing&#x22; is
covered in great depth and with amazing detail. It may be difficult for
everyone to grasp the &#x22;Whole picture&#x22; on the first watch, but that
doesn&#x27;t mean you wont understand whats going on. Thats the great part
about this film. If you are looking for a casual good time, this film
is for you. If you wish to watch something complex and beautiful, this
film is for you. Very rarely does something that can appeal to all
audiences come along, making this movie a real gem.<br /><br />Lastly, I would like to give credit where it is due. The acting is
simply phenomenal. Its believable, savvy, and emotional all at the same
time. Besides possibly Blood Diamond or the Departed, this is easily
Dicaprio&#x27;s best film to date. He plays a very hard character to
project; someone who is filled with contradictions, yet is still calm,
concise, and mature. Ellen Paige proved to me she can actually act with
a powerful and convincing supporting role. Gordon-Levitt(Arthur)
surprised me a great deal in this movie. Seeing his previous work I was
unimpressed(Brick, just to name one) but in this film he shows his true
talent. He pulls off the calm, level-headed partner to the T. He pulls
quite a bit of attention away from Dicaprio on the screen, which is in
no way an easy task. I give him absolute props for his role. Tom Hardy,
one of the best up and coming British actors in my opinion, brings the
comic relief to the movie and does it with the usual swagger he
commands. Lasty, Marion Cotillard impressed me yet again, not just
because of her beauty, but because of the emotion she brings to her
character. The cast is nothing short of perfect, and without them this
movie would still be good, but certainly not what it is. It takes
believable actors to make the material seem real. <br /><br />I am writing this review to hopefully convince those skeptics out there
to take a leap of faith. You wont be disappointed. &#x22;Inception&#x22; has
everything a good film should have. Romance, suspense, great dialogue,
plot twists etc etc. While it certainly isn&#x27;t my &#x22;favorite&#x22; movie of
all time, it sits pretty high on the list. Only a handful of movies in
the past have had this sort of effect on me, and it should hold true
for you as well. It will literally &#x22;blow your mind&#x22;. :)
