It is the rare film that can completely immerse you in its experience
to the point where it is hard to speak afterward. Inception is one of
those films - beyond breathtaking, an incredible mind-bending tale full
of action and suspense which takes us in to the world of dreams and
back.<br /><br />Inception is not only the most intelligent film of the year, it makes
the rest look like a finger painting. Christopher Nolan has again
manufactured a masterpiece of cinema, the story beyond intricate and
full of psychological twists and turns through the mind of dreams which
turns the action on its head - sometimes quite literally. The acting is
exceptional, with Joseph Gordeon-Levitt standing out and proving again
that he has more than enough acting chops to tackle bigger and better
roles. What is really incredible is how Nolan manages to carry such an
epic film with such a huge scale and yet maintain strong, well-rounded
characters. Leonardo DiCaprio&#x27;s Cobb is at the center of the story and
the focus is never taken off of him. Through Leo&#x27;s performance and
through sitting in Cobb&#x27;s dreams, Inception manages a new way of
getting us to feel what the film&#x27;s characters feel.<br /><br />Hans Zimmer&#x27;s score perfectly compliments Nolan&#x27;s actions on screen to
create an experience films rarely give us anymore. Both epic and
serene, Zimmer adds to the dream-like quality of the film and makes the
action set pieces that much larger.<br /><br />The set pieces of Inception are amazing. Not only is it refreshing to
see so many special effects without the use of CGI, but the
implementation of these special effects are the best I&#x27;ve seen. I only
wish I hadn&#x27;t seen any trailers for this film, as going in to this
movie with a blank pallet would have given the movie even more
exceptional moments, instead of hoping or waiting for &#x22;that moment&#x22; or
smiling when a humorous line from the trailer showed up in the film. I
could talk about the one central fight scene of the film for hours,
which is nothing short of a benchmark of set design, camera-work and
cinematography. I could watch this scene on loop for hours just to be
knocked out over and over again by the sheer scale of it.<br /><br />I cannot describe Inception as anything short of a masterpiece.
Especially in the dredge of summer cinema, Inception reminds us why we
go to films in the first place, giving us an intelligent film which
doesn&#x27;t fly over our heads (not that I&#x27;d recommend stepping out of the
theater for ever a minute during the movie).
