I&#x27;ve seen all Christopher Nolan&#x27;s movies and I must say that I&#x27;m quite
a fan of his job, however, this movie is beyond everything I&#x27;ve seen
not just in Nolan&#x27;s work, but in the entire decade. Nolan loves to play
with timing. Memento (his second long-cut) is the perfect example of
this. He also like a lot to create this suspense feeling to the viewer,
this feeling that you don&#x27;t know why but you know something great is
about to happen, you don&#x27;t know when, or what is it, but you just know.
It&#x27;s all in the sound, that&#x27;s the way he manage to make you get that
sensation. Inception is just the combination of Nolan&#x27;s best tricks,
the perfect combination. It takes you to a whole new world in a movie,
one that you&#x27;ve never imagined. The best movie of the year without
doubts! I think that this will get the nomination for best movie as
well as Nolan the nomination for best achievement in direction.
Christopher Nolan is on his way to get into the pages of
cinematographic history as one of the big names as a director and also
as writer.
