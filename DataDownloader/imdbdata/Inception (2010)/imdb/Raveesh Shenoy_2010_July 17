A movie is not only about ideas, but the way in which it is delivered
and this piece is living proof. Christopher Nolan personifies the idea
that every one of us has experienced at some level in the form of
dreams and creates an unprecedented and mind-numbing story. The human
mind is so dynamic and creative that when uninhibited can create
powerful alternate realities in the form of dreams.This dream draws its
details from memories, logic and most importantly ideas that can shape
every perceivable outcome. The story hinges on the perception that
ideas are resilient parasites which when implanted in the brain, grows
indiscriminately like a tumor and can supplant commonly held beliefs
and force the dreamer into revealing personal details to the
supplanter/extractor called &#x22;Inception&#x22;. Leonardo DiCaprio (Cobb) plays
the part of a world&#x27;s best extractor who gets a contract from a
powerful executive to perform inception. This is insignificant, as the
real story is about Cobb (DiCaprio) and his personal journey into
becoming the thief he is now. Everything else that is shown portends
the complexity of his past that has been a melting pot of love, hate,
loss, regret and anger. In fact at the end of the movie I completely
forgot the cast of characters other than DiCaprio and rightly so
because of the significance placed on the life of Cobb. Christopher
Nolan uses the most compelling images in the form of special effects
and a layered, interconnected plot that challenges your mind to think
unconventionally. I realized that most of the negative reviews results
from a poor understanding of the underlying theme and the inability to
make out the fast paced changes that occur in the movie. But it&#x27;s not
that complicated and as described in this review, has very few
underlying thematic points. Just sit back and enjoy the mind shattering
experience of understanding what dreams are all about.
