There is really not much more to say about Nolan&#x27;s latest piece of work
than that it is absolutely gorgeous. The way he creates a world you
really can dive into and be lost for around 2.5 hours is just great. I
really am a fan of this director and my expectations were pretty high
for this one, but you just CAN NOT set the bar high enough. I am really
looking forward to watching the film a second time. And a third. And a
fourth... But let&#x27;s not forget the writers. oh wait, i forgot. Nolan
wrote the screenplay himself. The plot is very complex, yet it is easy
to follow. I&#x27;ve been to the movies with my girlfriend&#x27;s parents and
even her mother could understand every little detail and even give me a
hint about some thoughts I made afterwards. And trust me: YOU are going
to do some thinking as well!
