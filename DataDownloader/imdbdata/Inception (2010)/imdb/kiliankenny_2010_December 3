Although this is my first review Inception is easy to describe in some
ways and not in others.Inception is definitely the best movie of 2010
if not then the best of the decade apart from The Dark Knight which is
also by Christopher Nolan and is also incredible.The plot is very hard
to completely follow.Its about this thing called inception which is
being able to enter peoples dreams and instead of stealing an idea
which Cobb does for his job to plant an idea I wont get into the plot
to much but I can tell you this it is superb everything about it is
superb from the presentation to the action scenes it is a must see for
anyone smart enough to understand it
