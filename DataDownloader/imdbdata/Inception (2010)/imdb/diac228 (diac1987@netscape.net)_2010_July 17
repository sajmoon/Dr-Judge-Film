Back in the 7th grade, a creative writing teacher repeatedly told the
entire class that in storytelling, never ever ever ever ever end the
story with &#x22;it was all a dream.&#x22; The best example she gave us was the
television show Dallas, which was ultimately killed ratings-wise after
pulling the feat. That being said, it was very hard to not think about
this rule of thumb when Inception starts. Inception is a crazy
mind-bending, heart-pounding, and spine-tingling thriller that boggles
the mind, tests your willpower, and keeps you one step behind. Keeping
up is an impossibility, the images presented are some of the craziest
in recent memory, and the overall experience was a very tense trip.<br /><br />This was the cleverest sci-fi flick since the severely underrated
Minority Report years ago. There is one major difference between the
nearly-flawless Minority Report and the oh-so-close-to-flawless
Inception: the subplot. While both movies have their main characters
trying to relinquish past personal demons, Minority Report molds it
into the main storyline without issue; whereas Inception&#x27;s subplot
deters away from the fun and mayhem of the main conflict. My interest
level was waning on the subplot, while remaining at the maximum during
the heist. Despite that setback, Inception is a sinister movie that is
worthy of a couple viewings.<br /><br />Inception is an original script by Christopher Nolan, who has proved
many times before he can deliver in the screen writing department. It
concerns a fugitive from the United States (Leonardo DiCaprio) that
specializes in stealing ideas from people&#x27;s dreams. He assembles a crew
for his toughest mission yet, instead of stealing ideas, actually
implementing one into the mind of a person. This plot description is
very basic, because part of the mystique and fun of Inception is
engaging yourself in the trip of a storyline as it goes through
different twists and turns. The dialogue is strong, the story is
intense and deep, and the rules about dreams and how to survive in them
are well-implemented.<br /><br />Just like in The Matrix and Minority Report, Inception&#x27;s rules about
the universe the characters are engaged in are all established and
explained quickly in the first act. In a nice move, the deeper and more
confusing of the rules are explained as the movie progresses further;
in a much more successful manner than the elongated conversations in
the Matrix trilogy (especially the second installment). And, just like
in the two examples, the visuals strongly compliment the story and all
its rules. Inception is easily one of the most visually striking and
impressive movies of the 21st century, by far surpassing that of
Avatar. Cities are built and destroyed, a hotel loses all evidence of
gravity and physics, and entire buildings crumble like Legos. The best
part of this movie is easily all the chaos that you get to see. I
strongly admire Nolan&#x27;s attempts to use the least amount of CGI
possible. And in this movie (just like The Dark Knight&#x97;his previous
movie), the lack of CGI helps the overall look.<br /><br />The cast of actors and actresses definitely help the movie as well.
That being said, only DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard have to truly flex
the acting muscles, while the rest of the cast adds style, sass, humor,
and realism to the experience. Directing them with precision and
attention to detail is the screenwriter himself Christopher Nolan. He
directs this far better than his Batman movies, and delivers his best
directing work since the underrated Insomnia. He handles his shots
carefully, and does a great job engulfing the viewers in beautiful
scenery. And the hotel sequence is one of the most unique action
sequences ever composed. It left the audience silently begging for
more.<br /><br />So what could possibly be wrong with the movie? Great production value,
great script, deep material, grand action sequences, good acting, and
let&#x27;s not forget the strong musical score of Hans Zimmer. The issue
comes with the pacing and the editing of the movie. The first quarter
of Inception runs rather slow and lacks that first excellent
suspenseful piece that was in The Matrix and Minority Report (The
opening encounter with Agent Smith and the first arrest scene,
respectively). Then there is one of the subplots, which while it is
important to the storyline, really drags down and breaks the pacing of
Inception. The main character&#x27;s conflict wasn&#x27;t fleshed-out very well,
nor was it that interesting. It&#x27;s similar to The Matrix&#x27;s totally
unnecessary romantic sequences---necessary to plot, but highly inferior
to the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Removing the essential but rather bland subplot involving
our main character, Inception is a purely majestic sci-fi flick that
will boggle the mind, test your imagination, and satisfy your craving
for something original to watch in the summer. The entire production
value was excellent, from the musical score to the directing to the
cinematography. I keep mentioning The Matrix and Minority Report
because those two movies were the last two times a science fiction
movie absolutely blew me away&#x97;before this one of course. Inception will
entertain, confuse, and mentally defeat you (in the first viewing at
least), but it&#x27;s just a few knots below the two examples in terms of
overall quality.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t let that bring you down though, because Inception must be watched
on the big screen in the best quality screen imaginable. Without the
usual heavy use of CGI, Inception brings you into a crazy imaginative
world where despite a variety of rules, nearly anything is possible.
Watch this with an open mind and mental preparation for visual and
content insanity. Recommend but with a fair warning: this is not for
the mindless.<br /><br />P.S. I love the final shot of the movie, even if I did groan a bit. And
you will too.
