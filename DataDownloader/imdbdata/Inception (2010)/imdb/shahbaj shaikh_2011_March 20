This is my 1st review.I have watched all Nolan&#x27;s films from FOLLOWING
to THE DARK KNIGHT and I must say Mr Nolan is a GIFTED DIRECTOR.Long
time after matrix i have seen such a brilliant movie.Inception is a
true masterpiece from Nolan.Brilliantly Directed,superb
screenplay,fantastic animation.every time i watch this it becomes much
better and better.Action,Suspense,Scifi,Top Cast this movie is just
perfect in every way.As always Leonardo Di Caprio is at his best.I
agree with one of the user review that this may be religion in a
decade.This movie is a must watch.waiting eagerly for his next batman
movie. Inception is one of the best movies of 2010.
