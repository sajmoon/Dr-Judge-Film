Christopher Nolan has impressed many a cinema goer in recent years with
the rebooted Batman series but this is an original work and allows more
people to see what Nolan is truly capable of doing in terms of writing.
The teaser trailer utilised the score which seemed to punch the viewer
in the face with the drum sound and only seemed to say to us, &#x27;we have
Christopher Nolan, come and see this film.&#x27; I must mention I feel a
kind of guilt thinking that because it blew me away. Leonardo Di Caprio
stars in his second great film of year as the &#x27;extractor&#x27; who
infiltrates the dreams of clients with a little help from Arthur played
by Joseph Gordon Levitt who researches the targets. There are so many
layers that I am simply not going into in a single review and that&#x27;s
the true focal point. You cannot really afford to let your attention
waver as you literally can miss something vital in a few seconds.<br /><br />All of the acting is probably flawless as Di Caprio plays the tortured
soul excellently still grieving for his wife and using his ability to
control dreams to be with her, meanwhile wondering if he will see his
children again. He really has stepped up and shown how well he can lead
a film and did wonderfully alongside Gordon-Levitt especially not to
mention the interaction between the Ariadne character. Aside from the
slow motion the special effects are wonderful and not used too much (if
you&#x27;ve seen the film you&#x27;ll know what I&#x27;m talking about). It&#x27;s been
compared to The Matrix in terms of its action scenes and the slow
motion involved which we saw in that trailer. The difference between
this and The Matrix is that it feels much more natural. When I see this
I mean it wasn&#x27;t just done for show. Obviously The Matrix introduced it
before everybody decided to put it in their films and spoof it to the
degree that it becomes one of the most tedious gags to feature in any
parody or spoof. In Inception though it serves a purpose and when the
slow motion is delivered boy is it delivered. You are blown away by
simply how they managed to film the scenes. Like I say its complex and
I really would recommend watching it more than once as there are
probably things I missed out on but it would be well worth subsequent
viewings.
