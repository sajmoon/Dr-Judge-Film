This movie is Christopher Nolan&#x27;s own attempt at inception. And a
successful one. He quite literally plants an Ingenious idea in your
mind and it becomes something you keep thinking about long after the
movie ends... This is not just a movie with stunning visualizations and
top notch acting, but an incredibly original story. An astonishingly
refreshing original story. I feared when I saw the list of films to be
released this summer. Last Airbender (Ouch). Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice
(Yikes). Marmaduke (Someone save us). But this makes up for all of
them. After seeing Batman Begins and the Dark Knight I started
comparing Nolan to a modern day Spielberg (Before his movies began to
resemble fecal matter). But I&#x27;m wrong. Not only does he direct these
masterpieces but he writes most of them, something Spielberg rarely
did. (Excluding the medal of Honor games, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t
original...) This story is from the mind of a genius and I look forward
to seeing anything else Nolan brings to the Silver Screen. Sure Iron
Man 2 and Predator were highly entertaining, Inception will truly leave
you in deep thought, long after you leave the theater. I saw it opening
day and I&#x27;ve thought about every detail... But I still haven&#x27;t got it
all figured out. It&#x27;s a fun movie because so many parts are debatable.
If you haven&#x27;t, you must see it. It&#x27;s all you&#x27;ll be able to talk about.
In every way Inception is endlessly compelling.
