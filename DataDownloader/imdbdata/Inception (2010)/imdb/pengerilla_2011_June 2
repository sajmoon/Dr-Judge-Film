Raiting definitely to high. Ordinary science fiction movie. Good
effects, but some parts of the story is lost in to much imagination,I
think it ran into exaggeration. If not play by Leonardo will be sure
just movie.In my opinion estimate is overstated. Really don&#x27;t know why
is so much talking about this movie. In the end is like some action
Rambo movie,to much shooting and killing..main actor kill like 100
people and nothing happen to him..what a crap. I don&#x27;t like the review
from some critics-if they spend more money in movie its not good
movie..its simple average movie and also which actor here play some
special role?
