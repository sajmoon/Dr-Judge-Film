Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of
extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious
during the dream state, when the mind is at its most vulnerable. Cobb&#x27;s
rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new
world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international
fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Cobb can invade
people&#x27;s dreams, so corporations hire him to steal business secrets
from rivals&#x27; subconscious. Saito, an energy magnate, wants Cobb to do
the reverse: not take information, but plant an idea in a rival&#x27;s mind.
Dom Cobb is able to use his unique skills to his advantage - he can
enter people&#x27;s minds through their dreams and thereby learn their
secrets. There is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set
designs and the special effects, and that is exceptional. The movie is
a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well pictured and the music
by Hans Zimmer is electronically haunting. Never, in the runtime of the
movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any
other object. Inception is a well-made movie, filmed in about 6
locations all over the world. It is an excellent and breathtaking movie
that may be one of the only films released so far during the Summer of
2010 that lives up to its hype. It is a nearly perfect and highly
original film that holds your attention until the credits roll. The
final hour of the film, is possibly one of the most complicated action
sequences put on film. You have to constantly be paying attention to
remember all of the layers of what is happening. Once the film ends,
you&#x27;ll want to watch it again, for there&#x27;s something new every time.
