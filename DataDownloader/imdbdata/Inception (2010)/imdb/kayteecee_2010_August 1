I went into this movie expecting one of the best movies of all time.
However, that is not what I saw. The runtime is extremely long and I
found myself checking the time several times throughout the film. It
was an interesting film to see, but it definitely does not belong on a
list with the likes of &#x22;Shawshank&#x22; or &#x22;Godfather&#x22;. The story was very
confusing.There seemed to be plot holes and loose story lines that were
never really tied up. The concept of the film is very intriguing and
you will leave the theater wondering what it was all about. However,
the atmosphere of some of the scenes felt very similar to Shutter
Island for me. I almost felt like Leonardo DiCaprio did not really have
to act much as he was basically playing a character similar to that of
Teddy Daniels. Hope he isn&#x27;t going to spend the rest of his career
playing that same character. It was also nice to see Ellen Page in
something besides Juno. She can be more than a snarky, pregnant
teenager. Also, The visual effects are extremely well-done.<br /><br />I am not a fan of Nolan&#x27;s work. The Dark Knight was a film that I could
never understand why there was so much hype. It was average to me, at
best. Inception, however, is much better than Memento.<br /><br />It is a film that you must see just because the concept is very
interesting, but it is not something that you can watch over and over
again.
