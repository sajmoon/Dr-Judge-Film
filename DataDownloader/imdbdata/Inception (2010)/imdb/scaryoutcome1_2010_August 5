Hmm i am going to keep this short and sweet, this is way overrated,
ir&#x27;s not great and it&#x27;s not bad.. however the 2 or so hours felt like 7
hours after watching this.<br /><br />Now i watch movies constantly, i even find myself quite intelligent
around films etc But this film is way, way overrated.. the best bits of
the film was actually believe it or not the drama sides of things.. the
story line was way over board and at times i felt like going to sleep
with boredom. However this being said the acting was good and the
stunts etc Just like Batman another overrated piece of work.. maybe if
i watch a second time it might be different.<br /><br />All i can say is go and see it if there&#x27;s nothing else worth watching,
Also don&#x27;t watch it if you don&#x27;t understand films as you won&#x27;t
understand this. And don&#x27;t watch it because you see a high 9.2 rating
and loads of overrated comments on here ..<br /><br />Movie 7 out of &#x27;10
