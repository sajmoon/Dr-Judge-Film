A shame that this movie is rated so highly on IMDb. Let me tell you
this, this movie is NOT a masterpiece and doesn&#x27;t even deserved to be
among the top 250 of the best movie of all time. A true masterpiece has
to be flawless and this movie is worth at most 5.8, no more. The
neuro-nonsense that follow suit from a scientific and a philosophical
point of view, Inception doesn&#x27;t make any sense at all...Inception must
start with a self-consistent theory of how the human brain works. What
is a memory? What is a dream? Because most of us human beings walk
around with only very fuzzy answers to these questions, filmmakers are
able to take rather outlandish positions on them without arousing any
hackles.In the case of Inception, the unstated premise of dreaming is
that one one is asleep, one is inhabiting what essentially amounts to a
parallel reality external to the mental state of the dreamer. This
premise makes for an admittedly entertaining film, but it is
preposterous. Dreaming is an entirely subjective experience; everything
is an illusion generated and perceived by the brain itself. You can no
more &#x22;enter&#x22; someone else&#x27;s dream than you can enter into a movie
that&#x27;s playing on the multiplex screen.If you &#x22;wake up&#x22; from a dream
and realize that you&#x27;re still dreaming, you haven&#x27;t entered a different
level of some dream-reality continuum -- you&#x27;ve just experienced
another illusory sensation. Contrary to the premise of the film, there
is no &#x22;architecture&#x22; of a dream. We may feel like we&#x27;re inhabiting an
elaborate, detailed and consistent landscape, but that&#x27;s just part of
the illusion. There are some ideas about dreaming in the film that are
actually accurate. For instance, it&#x27;s true that they are powerfully
influenced by emotion and subconscious cognition. And we often do wake
ourselves with a powerful muscle spasm, which sleep researchers call a
&#x22;hypnic jerk.&#x22; But the movie also trades in ideas that amount to little
more than folklore. It toys with the old idea that if you die in your
dream, you will also die in real life.In the movie, if you die in your
dream, you will enter a kind of coma. For obvious reasons, there is no
evidence for bangungut-like phenomena, or rather any evidence has gone
with the dreamers to their graves.What about the idea that time slows
down within a dream, that an elaborate sequence of events in
dream-space can take place in a few seconds of real time? As it
happens, this claim has been investigated by researchers exploring
lucid dreaming, and the results indicate that if there is any such
effect, it is fairly small. Okay, but does any of this matter?
Scientific error is rife in popular entertainment.I&#x27;m prepared to argue
that Inception&#x27;s misconceptions are both symptomatic and enabling of a
damaging confusion that is rife in American society: namely, that
between the internal subjective reality within our minds and the
external, universally accessible reality of the &#x22;real world.&#x22; It is
this confusion that give rise to magical thinking and its myriad
manifestations, from prayer-healing to &#x22;The Gift&#x22; and mystical notions
about near-death experiences.Confusion about the boundary between dream
and reality is particularly endemic among the religiously inclined, who
often perceive dreams as the source of real-world information. The
Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Israel, for instance, is located on a
spot identified in a dream by the Emperor Constantine&#x27;s mother, Helena.<br /><br />The perfect metaphor of this movie would be like this:&#x22;I liked it,&#x22;&#x22;I
didn&#x27;t really understand what was going on, but I liked it.&#x22;<br /><br />A tad overrated movie that need to be drop out of the top 250 movies
list of all time. I&#x27;ll give him 2 stars for the CGI effects who were
indeed well done. That is all.
