Don&#x27;t read a single iota of plot about this. Watch it. What I will tell
you is that DiCaprio may not have been better and is getting better the
older he gets, the rest of the cast are amazing (especially Tom Hardy
and Gordon-Levitt), the cinematography is at times breathtaking, Hans
Zimmer&#x27;s score is intoxicating (with Johnny Marr on guitar), and it
travels across continents like a Bond movie. Oh yeah, and it&#x27;s really,
really loud in parts. But this is about Christopher Nolan again. He has
crafted a serious adult thriller that happens to have exhilarating
action sequences that, importantly, don&#x27;t detract from the emotional
content and a plot you will have to sit and think about. It&#x27;s amazing
that in a time of remakes and sequels that a director is given carte
blanche to do what he wants and returns something as gratifying as
this. Stunning. Why are you still reading this? Go! Watch! Now
