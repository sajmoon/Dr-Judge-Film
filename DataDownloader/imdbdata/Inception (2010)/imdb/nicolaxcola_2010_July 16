Words cannot describe how wonderful this film is. I knew from the
trailers that Inception was going to be good, but I had no idea it was
going to be THIS good. It deserves more than a mere 10/10 stars. A
round of applause is what Christopher Nolan needs, he never fails to
impress me. Nothing but greatness is expected from the producer of The
Dark Knight. <br /><br />All the actors did a fantastic job portraying their characters. I felt
like Inception was real, and that dreams could be manipulated. Leonardo
DiCaprio, I must say, put his all into this movie. His acting abilities
shine in Inception (as in movies like Shutter Island and The Aviator).
The emotions were raw, and all the twists were perfect. The plot had a
deep meaning that made it complex; but it wasn&#x27;t so complex as to make
someone lost throughout the whole movie. The action scenes were
wonderful, and the graphics/special effects were breathtaking, possibly
the best special effects to date. There were multiple times during the
movie where I held my hands to my mouth and paused my breathing because
of the movie&#x27;s tension. I felt that the movie was never boring. The
dialogue and themes made it so that each scene was interesting. This
movie does have it&#x27;s fair share of dialogue, but it never made me want
to fall asleep. There is a perfect balance of action and speaking in
this movie. <br /><br />In total time, the movie comes to about 2 hours and 30 minutes.
However, while sitting in the theater seat, it felt shorter than that.
I had such a thrill while watching the film that when it was over I
mentally said to myself &#x22;Whattt? It&#x27;s over? /sad face&#x22;. A movie this
long to feel like an hour long movie = great. When time flies, you know
you&#x27;re watching an epic movie. <br /><br />The ending really got to me, it made me walk out of the theater and
think ... a lot. And there are few movies that can do that these days.
You can really tell that the director and actors spent a lot of time
producing this film. The philosophy went into levels that were
obviously well researched. I must say that Nolan has quite the
imagination, because how he produced a film with such a unique plot is
beyond me ... it&#x27;s just so perfect. <br /><br />I would definitely recommend this film to anyone. It is well worth the
money and time. It is a MUST SEE.
