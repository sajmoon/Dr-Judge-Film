Again Christopher Nolan has delivered a truly great film, with there
being no doubt in my mind that Inception will be talked about for a
long time. Though some may not have a full understanding of the
storyline, the visual effects are enough to keep their eyes attached to
the screen and remain intrigued as to what is going on.<br /><br />It has been commonly compared to &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; suggesting that it will,
like &#x22;The Matrix&#x22;, develop a great number of followers and go down as
one of the greatest mind-bending films in history.<br /><br />I won&#x27;t ruin the plot, or even mention any part of the storyline as I
believe you have to witness it yourself.<br /><br />I am incredibly eager to watch it again and again, but not in order to
fully understand it, but because it was FREAKING AWESOME!!!!!!
