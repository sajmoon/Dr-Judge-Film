If you wake from a dream only to find yourself in another dream, the
idea of an elusive reality can take hold and propagate like a virus,
never giving up. An idea, that most resilient of all parasites, that
can give purpose to existence, or tear it to pieces.<br /><br />Thats the central premise behind Nolan&#x27;s latest mind-bender,
&#x27;Inception&#x27;. It becomes fairly obvious from the start that one needs to
grab a thread and hold it tight lest you lose yourself in a maze of
dreams. As a cinematic production, the film is layered with genres
across the board. It operates on some levels as a thriller, on others
as a romantic drama, and some ingenious action sequences quite rightly
push it well into the action category as well. But to qualify this
feature into genres would be a mistake. For while the movie revolves
around a curious plot involving corporate espionage, it reveals a
surprisingly Freudian affection towards the various dream states and
their influence on our subconscious. One would be forgiven to call it a
thrilling study on the possibilities of dreams and the movement of
ideas, to and from these dreams, into the human subconscious.<br /><br />DiCaprio brings an understated tenderness to his character, which is
why i suspect Nolan picked him over the equally talented and oft-used
Bale. Gordon-Levitt leads a strong supporting cast, along with the
ever-cute Ellen Page. Cotillard deserves a special mention for the
haunting presence of a captivating wraith, dwelling inside Caprio&#x27;s
mind as a promised escape as well as a vengeful curse. What&#x27;s most
impressive is how deeply the cast believes in the world of dreams they
inhabit. DiCaprio&#x27;s expression on Page&#x27;s especially inspired
physics-bending trick in Paris is priceless. Even the old hat at dreams
confesses himself impressed.<br /><br />This movie is a must-see, not for it&#x27;s &#x27;entertainment&#x27; value, but for
the sake of an exhilarating new experience, quite like the ones we find
in an alternative &#x27;reality&#x27; buried too deep to be recalled later.
