Some films absolutely must be seen in a theater. Inception is one of
those rare films that will not be truly experienced without a big
screen, the bigger the better (IMAX if possible), or else you will not
feel as if you are in the... (well, you&#x27;ll see).<br /><br />On a Saturday afternoon, the theater was packed with the most diverse
audience I have ever seen: ages from early teen to people who looked as
though they had not been to a theater in decades; all races; many, many
ethnic backgrounds; male and female. And everyone seemed entranced from
the opening scene, all the way through to the final moment, when the
entire audience gasped in unison. (If you have seen Inception, you will
know exactly what I am talking about.)<br /><br />Don&#x27;t miss seeing a new classic be born. Enjoy!
