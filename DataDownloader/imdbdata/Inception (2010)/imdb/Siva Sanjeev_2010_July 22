Everyone creates art. Very few create masterpieces. Some masterpieces
are created with such strokes of intellect and ingenuity that you are
drawn into their imagination forgetting your own existence.<br /><br />The web was spun more intricately, no loopholes, no pitfalls, no
goof-ups. Bloody brilliance, talk about Hans Zimmer&#x27;s very apt
background score, or the cinematography or screenplay.<br /><br />If madness is like gravity, and all it needs is a gentle push, Nolan
pushes you off the cliff, and you keep falling down and down, dreaming,
until you get a kick towards the climax and then you realize, that you
are not a projection which Nolan had cast but you are yourself. In
simpler words, you get absorbed into the movie only to realize that you
are not in the movie, towards the end.<br /><br />The movie is surreal, it&#x27;s a chimera. But what makes this even more
interesting is the involvement of a human element, the emotions and the
haunting memories, and their limiting the construction and controlling
of dreams, at will.<br /><br />All the actors perform top-notch, may not be an Oscar winning
performance by DiCaprio, but definitely a well deserved supporting
actor to be won by Joseph Gordon Levitt, though Cillian Murphy and Tom
Hardy leave their mark too. In fact, they appear nothing in front of
Nolan&#x27;s absorbing screenplay.<br /><br />Nolan may be no Coppola or Hitchcock or Scorsese or Spielberg. These
men are absolute charmers, amazing story tellers who have inspired
thousands of other such men. But, even if Coppola made a Godfather,
Hitchcock a Psycho, Spielberg a Schindler&#x27;s list in 2010, all of them
would be swept away by this so called phenomenon &#x27;Inception&#x27;, the
reason, all of them can take you to level one of imagination or dream.
Nolan can take you to not one or two, but four nested levels down your
mind.<br /><br />Logic, dissidence, cynicism, skepticism, common sense will be put to
test. Buckle up your belts and enjoy the movie of a lifetime. A must
and should watch.<br /><br />The conception of Inception is an exception in the art of contraption,
a perception of a never ending deception of your apperception within a
circumscription, a preemption of your mind with no redemption. A
propositional ascription to Nolan, this is a prescription to befit your
mind&#x27;s consumption. The Inception is just an inception.<br /><br />After coming out of the theater, remember one thing. Nolan has put an
inception inside your head.
