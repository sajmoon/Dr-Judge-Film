When the film ended, the 18-year old boys start to clap and whoop like
they&#x27;d just had a religious experience. It reminded me of when I went
to Swordfish in the theater years ago with a really hot but REALLY dumb
blonde. When that movie ended, she clapped and whooped because she was
SO SMART and got it. Unfortunately, there was no post-film alcohol or
busty blonde to dull the pain of this evening&#x27;s experience. In my
opinion, Insomnia was Nolan&#x27;s only good film, and it was really the
performance by Pacino that grabbed me. <br /><br />Nolan is a talented version of M. Night Shyamalan, i.e. the Kings of
the Twist Ending. This is a pseudo compliment. I don&#x27;t think Nolan is
brilliant nor a great filmmaker. This movie didn&#x27;t scream intelligence,
though it really tries. In addition to making Nolan even more wealthy,
I hope the side benefit of this film&#x27;s success is studios taking on
more high budget pet projects that aren&#x27;t designed to sell happy meals
or sequels. Please PLEASE let this be the side benefit to Inception.
