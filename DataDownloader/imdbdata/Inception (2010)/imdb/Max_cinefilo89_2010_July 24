Few careers are as remarkably unique as Christopher Nolan&#x27;s: in only 12
years he&#x27;s moved from the likes of Following, his debut feature which
was shot during weekends for over a year, to Batman Begins and The Dark
Knight, movies that transcend their &#x22;genre&#x22; roots and become great
pieces of drama and cinema, conquering critics, awards and audiences (a
billion dollars and counting for The Dark Knight). And in between these
bigger projects, there are smart, compelling works like Memento and The
Prestige, expert lessons in storytelling and filmmaking that, on some
levels, are as much about Nolan himself as they are about the
characters populating those fictional universes. And then there&#x27;s
Inception, a rarity among summer blockbusters in that it has a
considerable budget (close to 200 million dollars), but also an
intelligent, layered script which demands attention from the viewer
(though not quite to the same degree as, say, The Matrix). It is also,
arguably up to this point, Nolan&#x27;s magnum opus.<br /><br />Given the director&#x27;s secretive attitude throughout production, the less
said about the plot, the better, apart from some basic information: The
main character, Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), is a man who specializes in
stealing elements from other people&#x27;s dreams, thanks to a technique he
has perfected over the years and a team of accomplices (Joseph
Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page and Tom Hardy, among others). He&#x27;s also
haunted by visions of his dead wife (Marion Cotillard) and some dark
secrets that prevent him from going back home. Then one day he is asked
to do the opposite of his standard MO: this time, he has to plant an
idea into the subject&#x27;s mind. No longer extraction, but inception...<br /><br />From the start, it is clear that Inception is far from the average
sci-fi thriller: the opening act alone is a masterclass in narrative
deception, thanks in no small part to Nolan&#x27;s decision to avoid any
visual gimmicks - color or format shifts - to separate the real world
from the dream-scape. The truth is in the most minute details, and
spotting them isn&#x27;t easy. If The Prestige was a not-so-subtle metaphor
for Nolan&#x27;s filmmaking (the structure of the magic trick mirrored his
handling of the plot), the concept is taken even further in Inception,
where the maze (i.e. the layout of the dream) constructed by Page&#x27;s
Ariadne (a highly symbolic name, taken from Greek mythology), reflects
the director&#x27;s visual storytelling, with a masterful use of inter-cuts
and music to guide us through his own cinematic labyrinth.<br /><br />At the same time, the film also has to deliver on the action level, and
it truly does: this is equal parts Memento (each scene clarifies or
even contradicts the previous one) and Batman Begins (a fact that is
slyly referenced in the casting of Ken Watanabe, Cillian Murphy and
Michael Caine), with explosions, chases and shootouts that complete the
story rather than being autonomous bits of film. From an impressive
hotel set-piece that bears comparison with The Matrix (the big
difference being that Nolan uses CGI as sparingly as possible) to the
magnificent shot of a street defying the laws of physics, everything
serves the story and its dream-like scope (the real reason Nolan waited
almost a decade to actually make a film). As for the movie&#x27;s human
center, a necessary element to make the whole thing work on an
emotional level, the doomed romance between Cobb (a superb DiCaprio who
just keeps getting better) and his wife (kudos to Cotillard for giving
such soul to a character that isn&#x27;t, strictly speaking, real), is the
summation of the director&#x27;s filmography, from Memento to The Dark
Knight via The Prestige: amidst all the spectacle and philosophy, it&#x27;s
the people that matter.<br /><br />Inception is with no doubt one of the year&#x27;s - heck, even the decade&#x27;s
- best films, complex but also hugely exciting and rewarding, a piece
of work that stimulates eyes, brain and heart and also embodies the
essence of Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s famed view on cinema: watching a movie is
like dreaming.
