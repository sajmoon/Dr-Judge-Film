I have been eagerly waiting to see this film and the first impression
after walking out of the theater was deception. The world of dreams is
a world of opportunities to make a perfect film but too much dreams
kill the dream. I find the locations of the filming a bit gray and as
one of the characters said: why didn&#x27;t they dream something sunny. As
for the plot, since the beginning of the film you keep asking yourself
is he dreaming this or not, which gives the movie another tone. Also I
find the plot and the characters a bit gray as well as for their
motives. But if you watch it as an action film you will be entertained.
For me this film doesn&#x27;t deserve to be in the top ten IMDb.
