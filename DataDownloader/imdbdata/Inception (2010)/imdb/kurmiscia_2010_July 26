I shook my head in disbelief and disappointment while groaning thru the
last 30 minutes &#x85;.should have walked out on it&#x85;<br /><br />70% of the movie is spent with the characters trying to explain, and
then re-explain the &#x22;overly far-fetched&#x22; parameters and boundaries of
the plot TO EACH OTHER! - I am pretty sure the actors couldn&#x27;t keep
pace with what was happening. I bet there are equally like-minded
scripts circulating at this very moment thru mental hospitals across
the country.<br /><br />The makers of this film expect you to buy into an awful lot (and that&#x27;s
just within the first 3 minutes) - leading you around and around not
knowing if you can even believe anything that happened only moments
before&#x85; and then, you get the nice overly used &#x22;OR IS IT??????&#x22; totally
smarmy and puzzling ending!!! (I saw that turd coming a mile away too)<br /><br />I guarantee you this&#x85; an evening rental of the movie and you will not
be able to stay awake&#x85; far too many changes in direction, each one more
annoying than the previous and yet still somewhat predictable.<br /><br />I&#x27;ll sum it up like this and see if you are still interested&#x85;..<br /><br />&#x22;It&#x27;s a dream within a dream, within a dream, within a dream (that&#x27;s
right&#x85; 4 annoying levels sleep) and possibly&#x85;. Within yet another dream
when it finally ends. COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL&#x85;&#x85;&#x85;&#x85;.N O T ! ! ! ! !
! !<br /><br />I say, &#x22;If you must go&#x85; bring something to throw at the screen&#x85; NO
STARS&#x85;.EVER. This film solidly establishes the new &#x22;basement&#x22; in film
making &#x22;
