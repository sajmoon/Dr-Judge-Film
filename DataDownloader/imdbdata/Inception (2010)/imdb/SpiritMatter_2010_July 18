By all means see Inception but....WARNING!!...prepare for audience mind
control through insertion of an idea into your mind. This idea could
prepare the way for the acceptance of rule with a rod of iron by either
the next world ruling Big Brother and/or the next Elijah preparing the
way for the Christ..... (the false prophet preparing the way for the
false (anti) Christ!!!!) The first level of the movie is what most
viewers grapple with. It involves a world where a few people have the
high tech capability of thought insertion into the mind of a dreaming
human. We are given a bone to chew on of dreams within dreams involving
multiple levels. It also has superficial echoes of the Fugitive and
Mission Impossible. These are used as distractions from the real
message being inserted at the second level of the movie.<br /><br />The second level involves insertion of an idea. The idea is that Big
Brother or whoever has a legitimate and reasonable right to destroy the
principles of individual freedom and the right of the individual to
control their own thoughts and ideas that, in turn, lead to exercising
their freedom to choose and subsequently their freedom to act on their
choices, (as long as no one else is significantly harmed or had their
equal rights infringed upon by those choices and actions this human
liberty is good). If the majority of the U.S. population accepts this
root idea, our Constitution is doomed, the hope that comes from being
in control of one&#x27;s life will be destroyed and liberty will be replaced
by an all knowing all controlling government. How much do you
appreciate the equal rights you enjoy which were endowed by and
according to the will of your true Creator?
