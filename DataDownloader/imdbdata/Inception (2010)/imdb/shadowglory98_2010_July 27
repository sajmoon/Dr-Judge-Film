This Movie May just be Americas Greatest Cinematic Achievement ... well
close to. The acting was phenomanol. Christopher Nolan has done it
again , first with The Dark Knight and now , Inception. Although Leo
Decaprio may have disappointed us before this time it is different , he
takes it to the philosophical point of view. Which I found so
interesting. The Special Effects were Mind-Blowing !!! Jordan oh
whatever his last name is was really good he was like the albert
einstein of this movie. Every part of this movie was put together
perfectly ... Except one. The only thing that makes me put a 9 out of
10 is that it was a bit confusing at parts the end makes you think
about what happens. So all in all see this movie !!!
