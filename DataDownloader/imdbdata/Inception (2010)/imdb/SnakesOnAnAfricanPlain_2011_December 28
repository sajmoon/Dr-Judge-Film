A fantastic cast join forces in a brilliant heist movie. The team are
assembled, there&#x27;s some emotional issues under the surface, and some
great chemistry. Levitt, Watanabe and Hardy are absolute scene
stealers. It&#x27;s a shame that the hype almost killed it. The film is not
intelligent, original or thought provoking. It&#x27;s just more intelligent,
original and thought provoking than most of the garbage that comes out.
A non-franchise film like this should be celebrated, but not worshiped.
Nolan uses heavy and basic dialogue to explain every minute detail,
removing any room for discussion. As we enter a new world, we are
lumped in with Page&#x27;s less than interesting fish out of water. She&#x27;s
there for the characters to explain stuff to, no real problem, but
there&#x27;s too much to explain. Most films with a fish out of water also
have them as the protagonist, so we are emotionally invested. Instead,
DiCaprio is the hero, making Page even more useless. In heist movies we
are familiar with all the different roles people play. Here we need
them explained. Then the film kicks off into action mode and the scenes
are mostly terrific, with a thousand backslaps for the incredible
hallway fight scene. I have a problem with dream films, in that they
don&#x27;t feel dreamlike enough. This is no exception. I never once felt as
though the true potential of this film was realised. In fact, they make
a point of making the dreams as real as possible so the person whose
mind is invaded doesn&#x27;t realise it&#x27;s a dream. I had a problem with this
because even in my most bizarre dreams I don&#x27;t realise they are dreams.
They feel real. Instead it just allowed quick jumps to different
settings for a wider range of action sequences. But if Nolan wants to
make a heist movie so bad, then he should just get on with it. This may
sound like I hated the film, but I really didn&#x27;t. The performances are
solid, some of the ideas are clever, the visuals are memorising, and
the action is exhilarating.
