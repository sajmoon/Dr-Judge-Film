it&#x27;s called inception it&#x27;s where they incept the audience, and then.
decept the audience with the mind blowing dream sequences, then you get
called a. pure genius. then the critics hail it as a pure asylum
mind-bending master-piece peter Wilson Chicago sun-times, then add a
few twist threw it. plus you have the prisoner 1967-68 to help you out,
that makes it a lot easier for you. get your screen-writing software (i

dream and mind film&#x27;s what ever else you think will work in your
script...throw some of your own scenes in it. because it does not look
original if you only use other peoples stuff, mix it up make some names
up for you characters, start the writing and you got your self a story
and then sell it or make it yourself, and then all that&#x27;s left is the
easy stuff. and then it&#x27;s the high life and then your a pure genius...
