In looking at Inception almost six months since its release, some
answers develop while many questions remain. Having seen the film three
times now, I must confess that I still don&#x27;t completely understand
every plot thread and story line. In fact, while learning more and
understanding about threads I was unsure of previously, I now have
other questions that didn&#x27;t even cross my mind the first two times I
watched it. Such is the nature of a very complex, multi-layered and
challenging film.<br /><br />To say Inception is challenging is a gross understatement; what
writer/director Christopher Nolan attempts to do with this story of
dream thieves invading a man&#x27;s subconscious to implant an idea is so
far above and beyond nearly every other filmmaker working today that it
should be admired strictly on that level. Indeed, right from the get-go
we are thrust into this world where seemingly anything is possible.
This atmosphere throws off the audience completely; we are now totally
in the hands of Nolan and where he decides to take us.<br /><br />As the story progresses, we are given tight, helpful exposition that at
times appears to simply pad the running time yet in the end is vitally
important to understanding every aspect of what we have seen. With such
a premise, Nolan is able to take wild fleets of fancy and his visual
style has never been more perfectly realized than here. Each layer of
the dream has its own distinct style, wisely constructed in a
straight-forward and understandable manner. Some critique the film for
not being strange or unpredictable enough, yet if it was could anyone
understand it? In the end, what Inception offers to audiences is a
challenging, thought-provoking journey that isn&#x27;t just about a team
trying to plant inception nor is it just about Dom Cobb&#x27;s attempt to
get to America to see his children. What Nolan is able to do on a
subconscious and psychological level is pretty astounding; there are
numerous elements and symbols most won&#x27;t be able to see even after
multiple viewings. To some this will not be entertaining or worthwhile.
But there will always be a small niche in the market for those who go
to the movies to see the art-form be stretched and expanded to its
limits and potential. Nolan&#x27;s film certainly does that and while it
will easily distract and polarize many people, if one looks hard enough
and with the right mindset, I believe one will see things and
understand what Nolan wants us to glean from this, whatever that may
be.
