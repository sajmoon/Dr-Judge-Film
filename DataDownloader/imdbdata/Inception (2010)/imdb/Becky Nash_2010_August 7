Wow. Its not often that I walk out of a cinema after seeing a movie and
feel the need to pinch myself. This film is so clever that I truly
thought that it was out of human capability to come up with a story
line so complex but yet fits so perfectly together.<br /><br />When reading a description of this film in the cinema magazine that you
pick up before you go in, I&#x27;m not going to lie I was terrified. Having
already ordered my tickets and being unable to change my mind, the
words &#x22;Hold on to your heads for a real brain bender&#x22; put me off
instantly. This description of the film made me expect something along
the lines of &#x27;The butterfly effect&#x27; or &#x27;Donnie Darko&#x27;, neither of which
I fully got my head around and mainly watched for the hunky male leads.<br /><br />However I couldn&#x27;t be more wrong about this masterpiece of a film, I
cannot really summarise in words how much it will make your jaw drop
continuously throughout and highly recommend that you see this.<br /><br />In conclusion - Phenomenal performances from everyone on screen -
Fantastic music - Fantastic settings - Pure genius of a story line -
Flawless <br /><br />Do not miss out on this, fasten your seat-belts to be truly blown away.
