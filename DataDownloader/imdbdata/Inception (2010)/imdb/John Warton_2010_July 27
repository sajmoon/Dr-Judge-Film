Inception is a heist film of a different breed and wrapping your head
around the details takes some effort, considering
writer/producer/director Christopher Nolan has interwoven 5 different
tiers of reality (one wakened, and four dreamscapes arranged like
concentric circles). It takes effort but it&#x27;s not impossible, because
the framework that motivates the dreamscapes and the action therein
acts as a guide &#x96; a safety rope to keep you tethered to comprehension.
Otherwise, you&#x27;re lost in a daze of dizzying visuals and intercut
realities, each with their own unique measure of time. <br /><br />The framework is this: Saito (Ken Watanabe) is the CEO of a Japanese
power company that wants to corner the market. Impeding this is a
larger British company owned by the dying magnate Maurice Fisher (Pete
Postlethwaite) and his son and heir the to the empire Robert Fisher
(Cillian Murphy). Saito needs to convince Fisher Jr. to break up the
empire (thus allowing Saito&#x27;s corporation to regain its control over
the world market) and hires Cobb (DiCaprio) and his team of
subconscious commandos to infiltrate Fisher Jr.&#x27;s mind in order to
impregnate him with that very notion. This is inception &#x96; planting the
seed of an idea in someone&#x27;s head but making it appear self-inspired.
Thus the brouhaha of the dreams within dreams. <br /><br />Nolan does provide us with some helpful signposts to keep us oriented,
however, and the tiers can be deduced by their unique locations: a
plane, a van, a hotel, a mountain bunker, and a crumbling city. And it
is an extraordinary ride on the whole. However, despite the vast
amounts of creativity Nolan puts into weaving this tale, I was
disappointed by the creativity the characters employ within the
dreamscapes. Early in the film, Cobb explains to newbie Ariadne (Ellen
Page) that dreams aren&#x27;t held to the same physical laws of existential
reality. Yet three of the four tiers in Fisher&#x27;s mind are nearly
identical to Newtonian physics. Why don&#x27;t the characters, in facing
Fisher Jr.&#x27;s mental defenses, adapt by taking advantage of the freedom
in defying the properties of the natural world? Why don&#x27;t the
characters pull up trees from the roots or grow extra arms? Certainly
each dreamscape adheres to its own internal properties but I would
think a little room for play would have ramped up the visual and
narrative intensity even further. That quibble being said, Inception is
a great ride of a film, and it&#x27;s rare that a movie forces the viewer to
think to this degree for this long. It&#x27;s a wonderful mental exercise
and I look forward to my next screening.
