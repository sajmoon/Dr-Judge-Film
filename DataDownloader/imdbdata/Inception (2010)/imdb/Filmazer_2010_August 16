I thought this was a good movie, but I also have to admit that I am a
little puzzled by the buzz it generated among movie-goers.<br /><br />While I&#x27;ve enjoyed most of director Nolan&#x27;s works, I found this one to
be missing something. It did not captivate me as much. For a story
about dreams, there&#x27;s nothing in the movie that felt dream-like or
creative to me. It felt mechanical and laborious.<br /><br />I did not understand the responsibility and work the architect has to
do. There were no perplexing mazes in the dreams that I had hoped to
see. The character Ellen Page played was only a plot device to lead us
into Dicaprio&#x27;s unresolved issues with the past, nothing more.<br /><br />Maybe I am not intelligent enough to fully appreciate this movie sure,
just as I don&#x27;t understand some reviewers with their difficult choice
of expressions. But to me, some of the best books are for children.<br /><br />Oh, I think I know what was missing in this movie that I mentioned
earlier. While trying hard to make audience wonder and calculate it
just loses heart.<br /><br />Still a good movie but just weak at the joints it seems.
