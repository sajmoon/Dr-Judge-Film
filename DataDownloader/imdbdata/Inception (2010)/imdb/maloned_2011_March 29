Inception is the first movie nominated for Best Picture that I hated
on. It&#x27;s not all that.<br /><br />My biggest problem was that they couldn&#x27;t get me to care about the
relationship between Leonardo DiCaprio, his wife and his child, which
was suppose to be Dom Cobb(DiCaprio character) biggest motivation. I
could care less for any of the characters, I wasn&#x27;t emotionally
invested at all.<br /><br />This isn&#x27;t the first time Christopher Nolan tried to take Film Art
concepts and commercialize it. This is an attempt at making a
surrealism commercial. The problem with trying to make a surreal movie
for the general public is that you have to make it understandable to
the masses. The dreams in the movie was too orderly. Surrealist films
like, Un Chien Andalou, are chaotic like dreams.<br /><br />Big visuals and action sequences aren&#x27;t enough anymore, if you can&#x27;t
get me care about what drives the story, you&#x27;re going to lose me.
