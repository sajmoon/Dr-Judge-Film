I cannot phrase it better, so I will quote Rex Reed who called
Inception&#x27;s storyline &#x22;prattling drivel.&#x22; A friend claimed Inception is
a &#x22;thinking person&#x27;s movie&#x22;, but a thinking person will realize that it
is only masquerading as a thinking person&#x27;s movie. At bottom,
intellectually, &#x22;there is no there there.&#x22; Add to this that someone
clearly believed the film needed to be pumped up with overwrought drama
to qualify it as a &#x22;summer blockbuster.&#x22; I couldn&#x27;t wait for it to end,
and when it did, the intrusiveness of the loud, schlocky music over the
closing credits seemed to crystallize all the incipient negative
feelings I had been having throughout the movie. I hope that this
director will go back to doing smaller films that do not stretch his
concepts beyond what they can support.
