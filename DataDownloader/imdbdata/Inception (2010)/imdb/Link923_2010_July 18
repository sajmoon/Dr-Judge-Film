The second you start watching this movie you know that this is
something you will remember whether that be excellent acting on part of
the entire cast. The special effects or the amazingly in depth plot
line that will captivate you all the way until the amazing climax that
literally had me,on the edge of my chair. If you don&#x27;t get this movie
then you, have no imagination. DiCaprio deserve every award Hollywood
can give an actor for this role and his co-star Cotillard deserves just
as much to give you the illusion of a relationship that as the viewer
cannot imagine or even begin to. With the fabulous Hans Zimmer for the
musical score this is best film you will see all summer.
