OK here goes. I&#x27;ll prepare myself for an ass kicking.<br /><br />I finish watching this film thinking are you guys really watching the
same film as me!!?? Does this film really deserve 9.1 out of 10??? (1st
sept 2010).<br /><br />I found this film incredibly frustrating. So I guess at the start you
learn what a cool concept the film is based on. Nice idea. Very
interesting. So why take over 2hrs to get to the point!!?? I fell
asleep twice whilst watching it and still managed to catch the end -
not feeling that i&#x27;d missed anything important.<br /><br />I didn&#x27;t really like the characters. In these films you tend to connect
with as least ONE character but I didn&#x27;t feel it here at all.<br /><br />So some of you like the FX?? Yeah that ONE scene they used in the
trailer. The one they sold the film on.<br /><br />Oh yeah. The last rant....i cant stand films where they introduce rules
and details that only apply in the next few scenes. It so annoying and
predictable. They do that a lot in this film.<br /><br />So anyway. I left asking myself and the other people I saw this with
why this film is so overrated and there are a lack of bad reviews about
it. We concluded its one of these trendy films that are meant to be
clever and intelligent. I think people will be afraid of saying bad
points about this just in case it suggests that they don&#x27;t understand
the concept. I for one did understand it, I just didn&#x27;t like it. I
certainly don&#x27;t think it deserves 9.1 out of 10.<br /><br />My suggestion....just go and rent Matrix or Minority Report or
something like that. Clever, visually brilliant AND enjoyable.
