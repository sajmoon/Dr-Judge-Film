Nolan is a master when it comes to coming up with a brilliant idea on
paper, and creating it as a film not just well but perfectly. Inception
is a reminder of why people go to the movies. It&#x27;s acting is great,
action is superb and the cinematography blew me away. Also the score
Hans Zimmer put together just makes every scene EPIC, even if it isn&#x27;t
supposed to be. If you haven&#x27;t seen this movie and you&#x27;re going to, I
recommend seeing it in Imax, the way it is meant to be seen. But one
tip: don&#x27;t leave that theatre at all or you will come back and be
confused. I have to just say this (no spoiler) that there is a fight
scene that will leave you with your jaw dropped and when you see it you
will understand.
