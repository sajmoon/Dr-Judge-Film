Inception has been justifiably lauded for its stunning action sequences
and inventive story, but it&#x27;s hardly a shock that such a talented group
of people could come up with those. What really surprised me was how
much emotional power it had. The dramatic tension builds gradually as
we learn more about the lead characters background until it reaches a
shattering climax that I haven&#x27;t experienced in science-fiction since
Aliens. It&#x27;s a very different movie but that sense of desperation, that
the person you love the most is in mortal peril, even doomed, is very
similar. I actually cried *twice* near the end and I can&#x27;t say that
about Transformers. There really is something for everyone in
Inception: spectacular action and effects; excellent acting (especially
from Leonardo DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard, who actually convince as a
loved-up couple); an intriguing plot; and, if that doesn&#x27;t tickle your
fancy, some seriously hot stars. (I suspect Tom Hardy keeps fit by
constantly beating off hoards of screaming fans with a large stick.)
The only downside is that it&#x27;s hard to see how all involved are going
to top this one but I can&#x27;t wait to see them try.
