Every once in a while, a movie comes out that you feel will be
completely original and great but come out with a stale feeling that it
did not live out to its potential.<br /><br />Inception is a good movie, a large part of it felt like a
roller-coaster and the story moved so fast that you had to focus a lot
on the what was going on to not get lost. This is something that is
usually not bad but mostly because you feel that the ending will answer
a lot of questions or may at least leave you with a final thought that
will keep you all giddy inside. Unfortunately, Inception does not leave
you with that thought, even though the ending presents an unanswered
question, its not a question that really needs an answer.<br /><br />Watching Leonardo DiCaprio act is always a pleasure, he is a great
actor and slowly becoming one of my all time favourites. The other main
actors are also always great, Gordon-Levitt, Watanabe, Ellen Page, all
capable of being lead actors, and have shown they can be before, not to
forget Michael Caine who can so easily do a supporting role that I
don&#x27;t even think he needs to read scripts anymore. However, none of
their characters are given any room for development, they are all
one-dimensional and you don&#x27;t care about them one bit when the movie
ends. The only character who could have died in the movie and would
have disturbed me would have been Ellen Page, and that&#x27;s only because
she looks so innocent. Cotillard was good and had more room for
development, but, still, not enough. I don&#x27;t even remember their names
in the movie, its to that point.<br /><br />The plot of the movie presents such a great premise, but, is so poorly
developed that it just yields a high-budget heist / redemption movie.
With a 5-10 minute introduction to the world and 30 minutes of
character development rather than gun-fighting, this movie could have
easily been an 8. Yet, to make it a real masterpiece, we would have
needed that special ending. That ending that left you with, &#x22;OH yes,
you got me, you got me good&#x22;, remember &#x22;The Usual Suspects&#x22; and the
unraveling of the genius, well, we don&#x27;t get that here.<br /><br />Now, I still gave it a 7, because the movie kept me interested enough
throughout and even as I was noticing the flaws, the next scene would
make me forget. Also, the originality of the concept of dreams is
pretty fresh and similar ambitions to the matrix, without physics
defying stunts, just imaginative architecture. It was indeed very
similar to Shutter Island and thus, it was bizarre watching a character
further develop in a complete separate movie. So, I was tempted to give
it a 6, but, compared to the other disappointments of late, I felt more
generous.<br /><br />Overall, its worth the watch, for the special effects and ambition, but
not worth all the praise. Nolan is a good director, but he has lost the
ability to wrap up stories well and is incapable of developing more
that one character in a film. In the dark knight, only the joker was
well developed or given room to grow, in memento, guy pierce was the
key focus and in this one, we only feel for Leonardo&#x27;s character, the
others, as good performances as they provided, are not at all given the
room to blossom. So, plot 6, performances 6, effects 8, ambition 8 =
average of 7
