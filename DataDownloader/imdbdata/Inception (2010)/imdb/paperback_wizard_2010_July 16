Christopher Nolan, the visionary director behind &#x22;Batman Begins&#x22;, &#x22;The
Dark Knight&#x22;, and &#x22;Memento&#x22;, has finally brought to life his project of
more than twenty years. Featuring a cast of some of the world&#x27;s
greatest stars, both young and old, and having been filmed in locations
in six different countries, &#x22;Inception&#x22;, in the words of the L.A.
Times, &#x22;blends the best of traditional and modern film-making&#x22;.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio headlines as Cobb, a con man who specializes in
stealing people&#x27;s secrets from within their very minds. Joseph
Gordon-Levitt (&#x22;3rd Rock from the Sun&#x22;) gives a remarkable performance
as his partner in crime. Tom Hardy (&#x22;Star Trek: Nemesis&#x22;), Dileep Rao
(&#x22;Avatar&#x22;), and Ellen Page (&#x22;Juno&#x22;) round out a team of highly talented
&#x22;intrusion experts&#x22;. They are hired by Ken Watanabe (&#x22;The Last
Samurai&#x22;) to do the impossible: rather than steal an idea from their
target&#x27;s (Cillian Murphy, &#x22;28 Days Later ...&#x22;) mind, they are to plant
an idea through a process called &#x22;inception&#x22;.<br /><br />There are many words to describe this movie. &#x22;Crime drama&#x22;, &#x22;sci-fi
thriller&#x22;, &#x22;international intrigue&#x22;, and &#x22;mind-bending masterpiece&#x22; all
would certainly be on the list. Nolan keeps you on the edge of your
seat until the very last second, barely giving you time to breathe as
you try to peel the layers and decide what is real and what is
illusion. There are many questions to answer as you follow the
characters ever deeper into the world of dreams. The greatest
questions, however, surround Cobb himself and his motives.<br /><br />Cobb is not your typical thief taking on &#x22;one last job&#x22;. While his
partner believes Cobb is just hoping to complete the job so he can see
his children again, Page&#x27;s character begins to suspect that he is
seeking something more. She soon learns that Cobb is haunted by the
memory of his dead wife, played by Marion Cotillard (&#x22;Public Enemies&#x22;),
who does far more than simply distract him from his duties. After all,
in the world of the subconscious, even the smallest distraction can
take you in directions you never expected to go.<br /><br />Like the layers of the dream worlds the team constructs for their
marks, this movie is crafted to convey one story; one single point that
comes delivered wrapped in marvelous visual effects, pulse-pounding
action sequences, intelligent dialogue, and even a fair amount of
humor. That single point, the two words I would use to describe this
movie, is &#x22;love story&#x22;. The great mystery of &#x22;Inception&#x22; is the story
of Cobb and his family, his wife and children, what he has done to
them, and how far he will go to recover them. While most reviewers may
focus on the spectacular special effects or the unique storytelling
elements, I believe the central theme of &#x22;Inception&#x22; is the unraveling
of Cobb&#x27;s character. Everything else is a vehicle for this storyline.<br /><br />As a writer, I think this is one of the finest examples of good
storytelling I&#x27;ve seen. As a moviegoer, I can&#x27;t think of a better way
to spend my money. I would recommend &#x22;Inception&#x22; to anyone, be they
seeking an action movie, an art film, a mystery thriller, or a
science-fiction wonder ride. For me, it is all those things and more;
but at its heart, it is a poignant love story.<br /><br />(Read original review here:
