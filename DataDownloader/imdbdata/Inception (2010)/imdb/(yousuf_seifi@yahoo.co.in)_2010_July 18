To begin with, let me inform that Christopher Nolan is one of my
favorite directors as 2 of my favorite movies (The Dark Knight and The
Prestige) are the work of the genius.<br /><br />Expectations were very high. However below are the points which i would
like to highlight: The Good: The sets were beautiful. The concept seems
something new The bad: 1- PACE: Thts the first thing that defines a
good or bad movie for movie.I got bored within 20 minutes.The
screenplay wasn&#x27;t convincing enough to keep me glued to the screen for
2 hours and 30 minutes.<br /><br />2- Trying to be over-complex: I feel Nolan tried his best to make this
movie as complex as possible. It was unnecessarily stretched for 2
hours adding layers after layers. I don&#x27;t understand why someone would
like to watch this movie twice to get the point.Why should one care if
at the end he was dreaming or not? 3- I felt that the shots that were
shown in snow were unnecessarily and could have been avoided.<br /><br />final Verdict: Highly over hyped as i don&#x27;t understand what people
liked about this movie as when i ask people who have given high ratings
to this movie about the story they have nothing much to say.<br /><br />Give it miss. Not recommended
