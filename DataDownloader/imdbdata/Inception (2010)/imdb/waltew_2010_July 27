Very exciting as a whole, but,<br /><br />Characters were a little flat. We didn&#x27;t really get enough information
about the characters. Most of the actors do a great job though.
DiCaprio is great.<br /><br />Too much action and shooting. The mountain &#x22;level&#x22; felt like a video
game. I would rather have seen some more illogical, claustrophobicly
scary scenes. I think The Matrix does this balancing act better. The
story was so thought through that the suspense in the second part of
the movie felt a little constructed.<br /><br />A lot of explanation going on. That&#x27;s often a bad thing.<br /><br />Great craftsmanship and a great movie nonetheless.
