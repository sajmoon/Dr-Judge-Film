When I thought Nolan could not outshine himself, I watch &#x22;Inception&#x22;.
This is not only a masterpiece of filmmaking, but a journey to a place
you don&#x27;t want to leave. One hour after watching it I am not able to
fully describe what I&#x27;ve seen, heard and felt. It&#x27;s absolutely
essential for your life to watch this movie. Once you watch it, you
will experience pure genius from an author when trying perfection, and
joy when you feel he made it. The cast, action, music, effects, plot
and subtext are combined in a way most directors only can dream of.
Nolan has proved, once again, that quality, intelligence and talent can
also work in mainstream industry. From this moment on, most films will
be boring, simple and not worth watching. That only happens when you
reach pure happiness. Thank you, Mr. Nolan, culture and cinema are
richer because of you, and so are our lives. If this man does not get
an Oscar award, the world is definitely doomed to ignorance and
therefore to an end.
