First off, I am unable to give this a 10 out of 10 if I were to be
completely honest. The only reason for this is continuity errors. There
were many scenes that I noticed breaks in continuity. With that said,
this movie will twist your mind, trip you up and feed you your favorite
dish all at the same time. I have never been in this much wonder and
awe over a film in my life. There have been other movies like Dejavu
that added a lot of complexity to its story, but Inception truly
captured my heart and set the beat at which it pumped!<br /><br />The cast complimented each other so well and added so much to this eye
popping, ear rattling, earth shaking drama. A very strong script, and
very talented videographers and editors added so much magic, I had to
lift my jaw off the floor numerous times! Nolan and Hans Zimmer grabbed
hold of all your senses and took them for a wild ride as you tried to
fully grasp the complexity and depth to this story. Please, please,
please treat yourself to an amazing time and go see Inception, you very
much could witness a movie that could stake its place in history as one
of the greatest films of all time! Everyone that took part in creating
this masterpiece... Thank you!
