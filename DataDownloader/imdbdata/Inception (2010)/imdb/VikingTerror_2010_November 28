I&#x27;ve never really felt a strong urge for reviewing a film here before,
but after seeing a lot of negative reviews based on total
misconceptions on what this film was about, I just felt I had to remedy
this brilliantly crafted film in some way from these would-be-critics.
Especially because a lot of these would-be-critics are only being
overly critical of the film because they see a chance to boost their
virtual IQ, much like the comic book guy from The Simpsons, by
nit-picking apart the logics and foundations of what is seen by many as
a fairly intelligent film. But then again, what good is a virtual
Mensa-card if you have no imagination? I even read some reviews
complaining about that there was no real villain. I mean, honestly? The
first misconception is that the main premise here is heist movie or a
movie about implanting an idea into the subconscious of another man.
Those are a mere backdrop for the real story, which is a man dealing
with the loss of his wife in his dreams through his subconscious. A man
torn by guilt over his wifes passing, and like all of us, processes his
everyday life, concerns and troubles through his dreams. Because of his
line of work, he is no longer able to dream while he&#x27;s asleep the
natural way but has to sedate himself and enter an architectured dream
world, a tool in which he can meet and talk to his own projection of
his wife and children which he hasn&#x27;t seen for a long time. And as we
go deeper into the layers of the subconscious, the more layers of his
inner problems gets peeled off and the more we learn about the true
nature of his wifes passing and how he has dealt with it. If you ask
me, this is a brilliant way to explore an on-screen personas inner
demons. Leave it to Christoper Nolan to think this stuff up.<br /><br />No, this is not a particularly complex film when you peel off all the
icings and the frostings, it was never supposed to be. It&#x27;s easy not to
notice the forest when you walk among the trees. What it is, is a
hallmark film that tells its story in a brilliant and innovative
fashion. To say that it is a stupid film with bad writing and character
development indicates to me that you either missed the story, lack
imagination or just want to go &#x22;against the current&#x22; by trying to put
down a film that the majority seems to like.<br /><br />Whatever the reasons are for giving this movie negative reviews, don&#x27;t
believe them. And don&#x27;t believe the hype either. See this film for
yourself. It deserves it.
