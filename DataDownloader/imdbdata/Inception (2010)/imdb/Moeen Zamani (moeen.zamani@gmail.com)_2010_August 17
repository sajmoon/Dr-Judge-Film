The best thing about this movie is that the idea for making it is
original, of course it has some connections to &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; or such
films but the story is full of original ideas that i have never seen
before.one of the good points is performance of the actors that is
excellent from Di Caprio to Ellen Page &#x26; 10 years efforts of Nolan to
write the story &#x26; planting this idea in a film is now working! although
we don&#x27;t have such films nowadays.before this movie i thought that &#x22;The
Dark Knight&#x22; with that perfection was the best film ever but after
watching this film absolutely i say that this is the best ever for
Hollywood.now it&#x27;s hard for me to watch film with lower-classed
stories.don&#x27;t forget that Nolan has made a great ending for this movie.
Thanks for reading!
