2010_July 16 
I went into this movie with low expectations and once this film
started, it took my expectations, strapped it to a rocket and took off.
This film was by far one of the most creative, mind-blowing, drama
driving, thrillers that I&#x27;ve seen in at least 5 years. The acting was
very solid on all parts when it came to fear, solving problems,
chemistry, and action. The score was magnificent, dark, deep,
suspenseful, and very escalating. You find yourself at points of the
film on the edge of your seat hoping that all the characters make it
through okay, especially with their own unique talents and the actors
made these characters seem so real that you&#x27;ll have to pinch yourself
and make sure that you are not the one that is in the dream world. I
will see this movie at least 2 more times and I will not be surprised
if it wins one or two Oscars at least.
