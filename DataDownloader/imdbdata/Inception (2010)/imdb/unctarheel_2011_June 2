Inception. Terrible movie. Huge waste of time. Dark scenes and mumbling
actors made it hard to follow. Concept pretty far-fetched making it
even harder to understand. At times I thought it would be better as a
comedy, instead of the dark, twisted story it was. I&#x27;ve never done
drugs, but this probably came close to an hallucinogenic experience.
I&#x27;m still not sure what happened in the movie. How did I not fall
asleep during this one?<br /><br />While most movie-goers don&#x27;t really want to think about what&#x27;s going
on, that&#x27;s all one could do during this stinker. Constantly thinking
about what was happening; why it was happening; what did it mean; what
did they say; who are all these people; what the heck is going on?
About an hour into it I thought for sure I&#x27;d fall asleep, but Inception
gave me such a huge headache, sleep was impossible.<br /><br />Inception may have been about dreams, but for me it was just a bad
nightmare!
