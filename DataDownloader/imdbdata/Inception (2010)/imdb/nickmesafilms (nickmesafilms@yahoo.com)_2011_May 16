In the history of mind-bending thrills from the Nolan universe
including &#x22;Memento&#x22;, &#x22;The Prestige&#x22;, &#x22;Batman Begins&#x22;, and &#x22;The Dark
Knight&#x22;, the next chapter of fooling the brain is Christopher Nolan&#x27;s
biggest hit to date, &#x22;Inception&#x22;. The story of sharing one dream and
explore another dream, and the expansion of the dreaming process to
navigate personal secrets was spoken through the words that only Nolan
can speak. The film sparked up like a flash. Many things were
impressive to me: the direction and writing of Christopher Nolan, the
amazing cast, the spectacular use of cinematography, film editing,
sound, and let&#x27;s not forget the awesome visual effects in the film.
Every moment of action, drama, and mind-bending was perfectly arranged,
and each moment felt challenging and spectacular. Like always, films
from Christopher Nolan are hard to understand, and the challenging
subject is excellent to enjoy. The film was like traveling back in time
into another dimension and allowed us to explore newer places and
creates a world of our own. I just enjoyed the many things the film had
to offer. That&#x27;s what makes a Christopher Nolan flick, a must-see.
&#x22;Inception&#x22;,in my review, &#x22;a stunning feature with a fantastic
dimensional setting.&#x22;
