~MY REVIEW CONTAINS SEVERAL REFERENCES TO TARKOVSKY, A QUOTATION FROM
ROGER EBERT AND ANOTHER FROM CHRISTOPHER NOLAN&#x27;S INCEPTION SCRIPT (for
detailed info check below the end of this article)~ <br /><br />Ideas need to be enriched while the roots are kept loyal, especially in
Sci-Fi. Above everything else, aware of the fact that while the story
is taking place in several dimensions of dreams, there is no link to
the real-life. My first point is about this huge story development
deficiency. The only link to our universal earth dimension is Michael
Caine character and the children, and they&#x27;re frozen, they&#x27;re playing
out there in the garden, we see from behind. This is the first thing
why the whole movie is para-psychologically inappropriate. <br /><br />I said para-psychologically inappropriate, &#x27;cos today psychology is in
the point that dreams expose supernatural(or meta-physical) skills of
human mind. If you are implanting an idea through a dream into
someone&#x27;s mind, it&#x27;s not that easy, THE BALANCE OF NATURE WOULDN&#x27;T
EASILY LET YOU DO THAT. As an example I want to compare the Inception
with &#x22;The Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind&#x22;. There, Jim Carrey was
going back time in his dream trying to identify the person who is
dating with his fianc&#xE9;e; but he ends up with facing a supernatural
vitality covering the person&#x27;s face. The way Nolan explains is this:
*(1)* &#x22;Never recreate places from your memory. Always imagine new
places.&#x22; <br /><br />When the time comes where Saito explains why he hired Cobb for the
implantation, this is all we get: *(2)* &#x22;You remind me of someone... a
man I met in a half-remembered dream. He was possessed of some radical
notions&#x22; So the most important question one ever needs to ask &#x22;How did
they all start to dream implantation?&#x22;. There is no answer nor
explanation to it. Whereas in its ancestor, &#x22;The Minority Report&#x22; was
quite brilliant at explaining the technological advance. <br /><br />Compare with Matrix, the dreams are your guides to the reality, you&#x27;re
not a guide to someone&#x27;s dream. Matrix gives you a clue of
understanding how some people&#x27;s lives may change with their dreams and
visions. It had this inspiration that Neo became a hero out of a loser.
Dreams are able to do that, as Wachowski Brothers taught us. Another
comparison can be done with the good and evil side. Nolan never divides
people into good vs. evil as Batman or as Memento or any films he&#x27;s
done. But for someone&#x27;s favor, Cobb is hired by business man to implant
an idea into another business man, which doesn&#x27;t do any thing with the
good. *(3)* &#x22;The only condition of fighting for the right to create is
faith in your own vocation, readiness to serve, and refusal to
compromise&#x22; <br /><br />Sci-Fi loves impossible, but it also denies the practical errors.
Inception&#x27;s plot is theoretically fine but practically slow off the
mark. <br /><br />Just like Roger Ebert said at Chicago Sun, Inception&#x27;s story can either
be told in a few sentences or not told at all. Ebert&#x27;s approach to
criticize Nolan&#x27;s earlier work was even more harsh. *(4)* &#x22;How does a
man with short-term memory loss, remember he has short-term memory
loss?&#x22; (for Memento). Some injuries can go engraved someone&#x27;s
sub-conscious, so he didn&#x27;t even need to remember it, he was just
living it. Though Ebert was right on one thing, that if Ellen Page
hasn&#x27;t been enrolled in the movie as a new chosen one to this
confidential job, the whole movie was almost meaning nonsense. <br /><br />The things that are likable is Marion Cotillard participating as a
independent virus in dreams, going in and killing whoever and whenever
she likes. Ellen Page is being used to create spaces in dreams, so that
the missionaries will be able to create totems that tell a person
whether they&#x27;re dreaming or living the reality. The only totem without
Ellen Page was the spinning of the whipping top in the sleep house.
Also the last dream which Di Caprio is having on the airplane was cut
in the half as if it was meant for to be continued. It was the only
dream that made me believe that someone is dreaming, whether it&#x27;s Cobb
or Arthur or any of the missionaries. &#x27;CAUSE DREAMS NEVER LAST. <br /><br />*(1)*(2)*: from Quotes for Inception at IMDb / *(3)* : from Andrei
