This film surpassed every expectation I had when I walked into the
theatre. Not only was the acting brilliant, the story superb, and just
the overall concept and execution flawless, but I left the theatre
completely mind blown. I left in a state of wonder, a state that I have
yet to come out of even though it has been 8 hours since seeing it.<br /><br />&#x22;Inception&#x22; has caused me to ponder the nature of dreams and reality,
made me just sit down and think, something so many films nowadays do
not do. I am 16, and I am disappointed at how so many films do not
strive to be anything special now. The main aim is to pull in as much
money in the box office as possible. James Cameron is even re-releasing
&#x22;Titanic&#x22; in 3-D and I am dying to know why? What is the need? More
money?! However Nolan&#x27;s &#x22;Inception&#x22; was simply exquisite in every
possible way. It contained romance, comedy, suspense, fantasy, reality,
and anything else you could ask for. <br /><br />There are going to be the reviewers that say this movie was too
confusing, or that it was nowhere near as good as everyone is making it
out to be, but I implore each and every one of you to go see this movie
and make the decision for yourself. This is a film that more films need
to strive to be like. Far too many of the films that have come out in
the past ten years are lacking in one aspect or another, but
&#x22;Inception&#x22; is truly a masterpiece.
