Inception is truly a world class movie directed by Christopher Nolan.
Directing a movie like Inception is a tedious task for any film maker.
But Nolan has handled the job perfectly.He has lined up a great
cast.Dicaprio is the talisman of the movie around which the other
characters are built.He had done an excellent job in Shutter island and
has done it once again in inception. This movie is an edge of the seat
thriller, that keeps its audience glued to their seats till the end,
where you don&#x27;t want to miss even a single scene.<br /><br />Music plays an important role in this movie.Great music from Hans
Zimmer.Inception travels through both dream and imaginary worlds at the
same time.Since dream has no boundaries, the idea is infinite.But Nolan
has done excellently well to present it to the audience in the best way
possible.Without mentioning Joseph Gordon-Levitt in my review would be
inappropriate. He is breath taking in the scenes in the dream world.
Inception is definitely going to be a strong contender for Oscar award
in multiple categories.<br /><br />Inception is a delightful roller coaster ride that reaches its
destination successfully.Definitely, a must watch.
