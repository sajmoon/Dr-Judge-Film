From a wannabe auteur/art-house cinephile&#x27;s point of view I&#x27;ll say,
&#x22;Nolan, you sold out...&#x22;.<br /><br />Nolan had a very original concept, but then he treated it in a way very
close to Memento, and then mixed it with strong elements of The Dark
Knight, which produced &#x27;Inception&#x27; a.k.a. Memento on Steroids.<br /><br />The product was a very generic Hollywood blockbuster due to the use of
lots of action sequences and explosions, even if they served a purpose
in the story, they underwhelmed the original concept, and made the
movie pretend to be bigger than it really is.<br /><br />The script took turns on your brain, just like Memento and The Dark
Knight, even though it;s way less smart than the first, it&#x27;s pretty
much like the latter, and at times it tries so hard, but felt like
Nolan didn&#x27;t invest more time finessing it.<br /><br />Cinematography was pretty much neo-noir, it worked at times, but at
others didn&#x27;t serve much purpose.<br /><br />Yet, it&#x27;s a pretty decent blockbuster, and could be easily a public&#x27;s
favorite, it has an OK story with lots of flash and a &#x22;smart&#x22; plot
that&#x27;d simply dazzle the public and make them feel that it was worth
their time.<br /><br />The best thing about this movie is the hotel corridor sequence, it
really was the highlight of the movie.
