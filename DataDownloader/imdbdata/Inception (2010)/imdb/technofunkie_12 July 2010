Usually I try to be careful with over hyping a film, or setting the
expectations too high, as film geeks all are guilty for, however for
Christopher Nolan&#x27;s Inception, this really is not possible.<br /><br />This is possibly one of the only perfect films I have ever seen. It is
absolutely confident in every way, something which is extremely
refreshing, even more so than Avatar. Christopher Nolan gets some slack
for making great to look at but ultimately heartless affairs, which I
for one do not agree with, however I do not think anyone can argue that
here. The emotional aspect of this film not only ties it all together
but is really the centre of this film, it is the focus. <br /><br />I do not want to over simplify the film, by simply calling it Kubrick
doing Bond, or Gondry on a huge budget, because I am sure it will be
called that but it is far more than that, it is something I do not
think Kubrick could have ever made. It is pure Nolan, and pure
greatness.<br /><br />I hate writing something which is pure fan-boy gushing, but its really
difficult here. I did not find a thing I did not like about it, I am
sure if maybe I saw it a second time, maybe I would find something
about it I didn&#x27;t like, but not the first time. The way it is cut,
means that there is always action on screen, if not, then the visuals
are interesting enough to keep your eyes glued.<br /><br />The final hour of the film, is possibly one of the most complicated
action sequences put on film. You have to constantly be paying
attention to remember all of the layers of what is happening. Without
spoiling anything, all I have to say is that is what this film is
about, that is what makes this film so great, layers. Once you have
seen this you will now what I am talking about.<br /><br />All of the actors are fantastic too, Di Caprio is the stand out here.
Yes, this is probably due to the fact he is the star and given all of
the emotional weight, but he handles it perfectly, similarly to his
performance in Shutter Island. Ellen Page, whom I usually hate, gives a
great performance here. Tom Hardy gives a break out performance here,
he is quite the bad ass.<br /><br />I hope audiences are ready for a film like this, a pure auteur driven
film which does not sacrifice a single frame for the studio. I would
hope this film will change Hollywood, as it is 100 percent the
directors vision yet it is definitely a marketable film, much like
District 9, yet I do not think it will. <br /><br />I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say
everyone and anyone should see it. Sorry about all the gushing, it is
just so hard not too.<br /><br />If you liked this review check out my new film blog:
