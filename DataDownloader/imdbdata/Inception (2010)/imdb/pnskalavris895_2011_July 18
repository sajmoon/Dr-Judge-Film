I saw Memento very recently, something that turned out to be a great
miss.I saw it again, just to make a couple of thins straight-and i&#x27;ll
definitely do the same with Inception.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan keeps improving himself, with even more complex and
multilayer script like this.And i thought Memento was hard to reach by
most of the viewers, but no.Inception will keep you mesmerized and
captivated by the genius, that&#x27;s hidden behind it.And not just
directors and screenwriters (or with other words-Nolan), but with
acting and sound-and effects and editing as well.<br /><br />When you have a cast like this-i mean Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph
Gordon-Lewitt, Michael Caine, or Marion Cotillard (a personal
favorite), the movie just keeps going flawlessly.Most of the crew is
the same the Nolan brothers worked with on TDK and earlier in Batman
Begins.So the Oscar nominations in those categories are a certainty for
me.Inception is one of the best films i have ever seen.
