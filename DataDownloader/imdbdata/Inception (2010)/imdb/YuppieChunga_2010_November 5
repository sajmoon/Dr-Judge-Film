Inception was a display of excellence, which is rarely presented to the
mainstream audience. Hence its extraordinary rating by IMDb&#x27;s members.<br /><br />There are no movies to date that can match this caliber of writing,
directing or filming when considering the genre. It was fast paced,
intense, emotional and everything in between. I do not posses enough
superlatives in my vocabulary to correctly describe this gem of a
movie.<br /><br />The cast is perfectly balanced, and there are no dead weight. DiCaprio
stars as the protagonist of the story and executes his role to the dot.
However, he does no carry the movie by himself, and the whole group
dynamic is flawless.<br /><br />This movie has a fate, and a great one at that. I&#x27;ll leave you with a
word to remember this movie by, and it sums it up nicely as well.<br /><br />Flawless.
