i cant believe this movie has this great rating!! it was down right
ridiculous!! the idea of several people being in the same dream. this
is what happens throughout the movie. its impossible, and its just not
even made to be believable, even by the movie. nothing in this movie
would ever happen in real life, nor would anyone want it to.<br /><br />the whole movie objective is spent trying to plant an idea in someones
head(through a dream) in order to get him to destroy/sell off his
company in real life. if you wanted to plant an idea in someones head
to influence him to do something, why the hell would you use a dream to
do it??? who ever acts on stuff that happens to them in their dreams??
i mean i dream every week i can fly like superman, but i don&#x27;t wake up
and go diving off buildings!! cause its just a dream, the events that
happen in dreams didn&#x27;t really happen!!! so why would i take real life
action on them..<br /><br />man this movie was such a blunder, i cant believe so many people bought
into it. there were a few cool visuals, but nothing spectacular. the
plot is very poor and the movie is trying to tell too much in too
little time, and it all ends up in a mess of a movie
