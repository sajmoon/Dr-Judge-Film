Generally I don&#x27;t write reviews to any movies. Because I&#x27;m not a good
writer. <br /><br />But Nolan is a very very good writer what an genius he is.<br /><br />He has given the film of the decade for sure.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t want to tell anything about the plot of the movie. just go and
enjoy the movie.<br /><br />Nolan will get Oscar for at least two categories <br /><br />Dicaprio&#x27;s no no Cobb&#x27;s acting he live as Cobb. I would be surprised if
he didn&#x27;t get Oscar for it.<br /><br />It is very rare to see a movie which has very good action and and very
good story behind it<br /><br />The music in this film is perfect, never intrusive <br /><br />Flaws of the movie I don&#x27;t find any. one thing i can say is that You
might need to see at least twice to understand it.<br /><br />Thanks for such wonderful film
