After reading up on the initial reviews before it premiered and
watching the trailers, I expected a great movie. What I saw was a movie
with a very interesting concept but for some reason there was a lot of
action that was totally irrelevant for the story. I was mostly
irritated about all the shooting and action since it did nothing but
prolong the movie. In the end the movie has an interesting concept that
gets mixed in with James Bond and all other action movies you can think
of and it just feels like a total waste of time to go see this film. It
is neither a good action movie nor a movie with a believable story. The
movie just is not interesting and it does not feel unique.<br /><br />Go see something else!
