The Inception is one of those movies where the director is heavily
inspired by path-breaking action movies like The Matrix and fatuously
assumes that if he injects a movie with a convoluted and utterly
unfathomable storyline punctuated by raucous and gratuitous action, it
will conquer the box-office. Although I used the word &#x27;fatuously&#x27;, we
are clearly seeing that the movie is really conquering the box-office
(such a shame), but what surprises me more is the critical acclaim
being lavished on it. A 9.4 rating on IMDb?????? Competing with The
Godfather????? I will tell you what happened. Some people, who have
this quirky habit of lionizing anything they fail to fathom, did the
same thing with the utmost vigour, and it spread like an infection, as
a result of which, people who didn&#x27;t understand an iota of the movie
(just like me, and possibly just like everybody else!) started giving
the movie similar rave reviews in the fear that if they fail to
appreciate the movie they will be intellectually belittled in front of
those who succeeded. Peer pressure, we can call it. This movie is
replete with logical fallacies and inconsistencies, and is so so
undecipherable,it compels an endless litany of How&#x27;s and Why&#x27;s and
What&#x27;s from the audience, however esoteric his tastes in sci-fi movies
might be. A dream, nested within another, and another, and
another...???? What the hell man? I just couldn&#x27;t discern a single
moment of this two hour horror, and I honestly believe that everybody
else couldn&#x27;t either, for hey, this is no Bergman or Kurosawa or
Fellini stuff that panders to but the most intellectual. This is just a
sci-fi flick, and while I can&#x27;t claim I decipher all sci-fi films I
see, I am certainly not that dumb as to not have any idea whatsoever
about what the movie depicted. There are so many scenes that makes you
think &#x27;Hey, where did that come from?&#x27;,there are an endless plethora of
scenes whose absence wouldn&#x27;t have caused a tinker of difference to the
movie, for you will understand neither the scene, nor its relevance to
the film. I remember to have seen a movie &#x27;Mulholland Drive&#x27;, directed
by David Lynch. I had the exactly same experience then too, but I
chalked it up to its intellectual level that far outran mine. But this
ain&#x27;t the same case. This movie is just a two hour long incoherent,
meaningless garbage. I wish I could give it zero. It will be a matter
of great shame if the movie continues to hold its rating after more
than 5-6 months, and even more shame if people who are extolling its
virtues now don&#x27;t thrash it later. For it takes much more than some
glossy action and convoluted absence of story to propel a movie to cult
status.
