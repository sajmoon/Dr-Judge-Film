The movie was truly a masterpiece. It was exciting, suspenseful, action
packed, and interesting. The story of Inception is arguably the best
story ever written in the history of movies. It was definitely worth
spending 10 dollars on. I strongly suggest this movie. I totally loved
it. This is Nolan&#x27;s best film yet. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised at all if
this movie beat avatar. I was at the edge of my seat the whole time.
This movie is kinda like Matrix. It is very good, and is the 5th most
popular movie in the world among critics. I&#x27;ve never seen a movie good
as Inception. I hope that you&#x27;ll love it too. I hope they&#x27;ll make a
sequel. It&#x27;s the best movie in the world.
