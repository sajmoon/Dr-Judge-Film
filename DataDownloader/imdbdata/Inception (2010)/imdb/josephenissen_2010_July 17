Inception comes at a time where originality and the minds behind such
original films is somewhat of a rare commodity, and most people agree.
I&#x27;m not going to compare this film to other films because it would
serve no justice, only negativity, and this film embraces not only what
most film makers fear to create, but us movie goers dare to watch for
the sheer fact that this film allows you to be open-minded, but only by
an &#x22;idea&#x22; implanted in us through watching it. From the beginning to
the end my heart raced in excitement and my mind raced to keep up with
my own reality as I couldn&#x27;t help but feel like this film resonated in
my soul, no, more like my soul resonated in this film. Nolan has
delicately interwoven this fabric of life&#x27;s elements and an amazing
idea that few people can even dream of, literally. It blends twists and
turns as well as penetrating several layers of the imagination with a
story of love, espionage, hope, despair, fun and fear. Inception
invigorates the mind and soul with not just an &#x22;idea&#x22;, but the process
of which takes you on a journey with child-like wonder with an age old
feel with new age technology. The visual effects combined with deeply
rooted human elements will leave you wanting more, yet barely able to
take any more. When the movie was over I wanted it to go on, kind of
like waking up from a dream and wanting to go back to sleep just to
experience the dream even more. However, even with that being the case,
the ending was as beautiful as it was perfect. Well after watching this
film I keep understanding new elements of it, therefore I must watch it
again and maybe a third time. It&#x27;s like waking from a dream not is not
your dream, but it&#x27;s not a dream...or is it?
