Inception is simply put an incredible film with so many good things
going for it. This movie is basically set in this futuristic world(no
one knows the time period) where there is this new technology where a
subject is able to enter another subject&#x27;s dreams through inception. It
is a BRILLIANT concept for a movie and Nolan does a fantastic job with
that concept through the direction and the script. WOW DOES NOLAN HAVE
EXCELLENT WRITING! I have never seen a movie like this in a while! Now
many critics are bashing this movie saying &#x22;Oh. ITS TOO CONFUSING!&#x22;
&#x22;There is barely any character development&#x22; BLAH! BLAH! BLAH!
Seriously? OK sure there is barely any character development in the
supporting cast but there is a lot of development in Cobb with his
relationship with Mal. I will not go in any detail with this plot since
you will not understand. Even till this day, I still don&#x27;t understand
what makes it such a good movie maybe because you catch these
wonderfully-thought ideas that Nolan created! Now, lets move on to the
cast. The cast in this couldn&#x27;t have been more perfect! Leonardo
Dicaprio plays Cobb who is one of the best extractors in the world but
there is a reason he has to do this though. I will not reveal how until
you see this film. Anyway, Ellen Page plays Ariadne who is the
architect of Cobb&#x27;s extraction team. Then there&#x27;s a plethora of fine
talent: Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy and CILLIAN
MURPHY! Now, can we just say that this is an amazing cast or what?
Plus, the visuals are absolutely stunning! But other than that, this
movie will boggle your mind and will leave you scratching your head so
please do Nolan a favor and go see his masterpiece!
