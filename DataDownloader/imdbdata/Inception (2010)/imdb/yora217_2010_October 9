Let me start off by saying, THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!! if you
have not seen it, it is a must see. This is the movie of the year
already. the story is very powerful in emotion and the way it is told,
it requires ones full attention to understand and enjoy. If you miss
out on small details, even the minor ones, you will be lost towards the
end. the cast of this amazing movie involves one of my personal fav
actors, Leonardo Dicpario, who is just incredible in this movie, he
really gets into his role and does it with great care, he doesn&#x27;t do
anything clich&#xE9;, what he does here is original. Ellen Page is also here
and she is fantastic here as the architect who helps Leo and his team.
Joseph Gordan Levitt is also amazing, i would rank him second to
Leonardo, the two of them make a great team. I will not say too much of
the plot because it is something that must be seen to believe, but i
will say that it is definitely something that will be talked about for
years to come, its a must see and i highly recommend it!!!!!!!
