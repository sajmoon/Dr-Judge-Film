Fantastic and amazing movie by Nolan. Inception reveals the true genius
directors best ideas!! The subject though found similar in line with
Matrix, Nolan has scripted a good plot involving another subplot and
making the story in layer wise.<br /><br />Good taking, action, screenplay and direction.<br /><br />Music should have been better. Editing was fine and neat.<br /><br />Movie makes the audience involve slowly and precisely, making clear the
plot. dealing the subject of dreams is wonderful with the director. He
has succeeded to full level.<br /><br />After the movie you really feel No dreams are dreams anymore!! <br /><br />9.5 stars out of 10
