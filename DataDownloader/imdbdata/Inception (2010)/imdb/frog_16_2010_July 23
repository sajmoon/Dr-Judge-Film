Caution, spoilers below:<br /><br />What bothered me initially about the film was that the dreams just
didn&#x27;t seem very dream-like. Most of the dreams were too detailed and
clear, and seemed too strict in following the logical patterns the film
set for them. Most of the dreams lacked the surreal touches, the dreamy
fuzziness as portrayed in other much simpler films like &#x22;Dreamscape&#x22;. <br /><br />Also some important rules followed by the &#x27;induced&#x27; dreams of the film
appear to only apply to those types of dreams and not to natural
dreams... I know this may seem obvious but I think the film
unnecessarily blurred the line between the &#x27;nature&#x27; of the induced and
natural dreams leading to some confusion. <br /><br />Another thing I had a lot of trouble buying into was that the
characters involved in multi-layered dreams left behind some sort of
&#x27;ethereal&#x27; bodies asleep at the lower dream levels. <br /><br />In other words, when their minds move on to another dream level I see
no logical reason why they would be leaving behind some bizarre
dream-sleep bodies at the lower levels. <br /><br />They might DREAM that they are waking up from one level to the next but
to say that they actually leave behind some sort of sleeping dream-body
seems silly to me. <br /><br />e.g. I can go along with the idea that the &#x27;Chemist&#x27; might experience
the others as being in a drug induced sleep while he&#x27;s driving the van
during that wild chase scene. But why would the others have any
dependency-on the Chemist&#x27;s perception of their sleeping bodies at the
lower dream level? <br /><br />One aspect of the film I liked a lot is that there are hints now and
then that we are still actually watching a dream when the characters
are supposedly awake... <br /><br />Didn&#x27;t the Cobb character say there was a danger in composing a dream
too close to your real-life because you could no longer distinguish
between the two?
