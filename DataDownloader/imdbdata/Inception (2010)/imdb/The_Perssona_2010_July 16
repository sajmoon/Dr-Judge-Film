Let me begin by addressing the criticisms of this film: that it&#x27;s
either too slow, too complicated, or superficially emotional. All of
these claims are completely and utterly misguided and wrong.<br /><br />Inception is a movie unlike any other. It combines heart-stopping
action, mind bending psychological concepts, and deep emotional
conflicts, wraps them in a tight, perfectly edited package, and drop
kicks you with them in the face. The cool part is that you won&#x27;t be
surprised at how little you understand, but rather how much you
understand. The scripting and pacing is so well planned and pieced
together and everything is explained in the perfect amount of detail,
which serves to make the end of the movie a mind-blowing climax of epic
proportions.<br /><br />Scoring by Hans Zimmer is to die for. It&#x27;s a mysterious combination of
elements of Batman, Bourne, and Quantum of Solace, which are all
revolutionary scores, and it completes the movie. But let&#x27;s be serious,
everything completes this movie. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, DiCaprio, and
Ellen Paige all turn in rock star performances. The only character that
feels underdeveloped is &#x22;Fischer,&#x22; who comes off as cold, but whose
emotional transformation isn&#x27;t entirely convincing. Luckily, the rest
of the movie is so engrossing at every moment that this does not
detract from the overall experience. Nolan doesn&#x27;t need to fall back on
high-buck CGI either. The sets, locales, and visuals are stunning
without being overbearing.<br /><br />These gorgeous visuals, ludicrous editing, brilliant scoring, a
synergistic cast, and a plot that makes you think and rewards you for
your mental effort combine to transform this from a movie into an
amazing mental journey.
