Going into a movie with high expectations can set the viewer up for
disappointment (I know because I&#x27;ve been let down many times.)
Christopher Nolan&#x97;the master responsible for such greats as Memento,
Batman Begins, The Prestige, and The Dark Knight&#x97;has been the most
reliably excellent filmmaker of the past decade; he has never failed to
deliver. He continues his winning streak with the remarkable Inception.
The movie is so packed with detail and has so many layers that upon the
audience&#x27;s first viewing, they just go along for the ride and try to
keep up with it. The story follows Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), an
extractor who tries to steal information from other people&#x27;s dreams.
There to assist him in his escapades is Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt.)
They are hired by an influential businessman named Saito (Ken Watanabe)
to infiltrate a rival&#x27;s (Cillian Murphy) dreams not to steal an idea,
but rather to plant one. This is called inception. Stealing information
from dreams is difficult; planting an idea is even more so. Cobb and
Arthur are hesitant to accept the job. However, Cobb wants to do it so
that he can quit the business for good and get back home and see his
kids, whom he hasn&#x27;t seen for a long time. He assembles a team to help
him. They include an architect (Ellen Page), who creates the
dreamscapes; a forger (Tom Hardy), who can imitate other people within
the dreams; and a chemist (Dileep Rao), who concocts the complex
chemical cocktails used to induce the necessary states of dreaming. To
fool the dreamer, sometimes Cobb and his team construct dreams within
dreams. To accomplish inception, they need to create a dream within a
dream within a dream. If that sounds complicated, there is one more
layer still: limbo. This is a dangerous world of raw subconsciousness
from which it is very difficult to return. There are other difficulties
to overcome besides navigating dreamers&#x27; minds. If projections of the
dreamer&#x27;s subconscious start to detect an intrusion, they attack like
white blood cells. The probability of this goes up if the dreamer has
been trained to guard themselves by an extractor. In addition, Dom&#x27;s
efforts are sometimes foiled by projections of his wife (Marion
Cotillard.) He and his team also have to use &#x22;kicks,&#x22; which are prompts
to wake them up at just the right moment. In the waking world, he and
his team are on the run from both the law and former marks and clients.
As expected, much of the movie takes place in dreams. Inception&#x27;s
visual style matches its lofty creative ambitions. The marriage of art
direction and special effects is seamless; it&#x27;s hard to tell where one
begins and the other ends. This sometimes makes it difficult to discern
dreams from reality, and this is almost certainly done by design. In
the dream sequences, there are some extraordinary images, such as
entire cities folding over on themselves, zero-gravity scenes in a
hotel hallway, and paradoxical shapes, like infinite staircases. In a
season of light-hearted popcorn flicks that are forgotten shortly after
one has left the theater, Inception is a rare treat indeed&#x97;a
brain-teaser that demands the audience rise to its level, rather than
insulting the viewer&#x27;s intelligence by stooping too low. The dreams
Christopher Nolan creates and puts up on screen are worlds of pure
imagination where anything seems possible, yet they have their own
sense of order; they have limits and laws of existence. This film sets
viewers&#x27; minds in motion like spinning tops, sending them out of the
theater reeling and ready to come back again for a repeat viewing. <br /><br />http://raisedonvideo.wordpress.com
