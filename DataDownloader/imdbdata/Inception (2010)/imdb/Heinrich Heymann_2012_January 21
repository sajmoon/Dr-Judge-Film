Okay, first of all, I had really high expectations for this film, I
mean really high! And I didn&#x27;t think that I was going to say this, but
Inception actually exceeded my (super high) expectation. Christopher
Nolan, now definitely one of my favorite directors, really did make a
nearly perfect movie here.<br /><br />Even though I have watched most of Nolan&#x27;s films (Momento, Insomnia &#x26;
Batman Begins), I only really started to notice his talent in The
Prestige, which is also probably in my Top 10 movies of all time. Then
of course, came The Dark Knight, which blew my mind and is my favorite
movie of 2008.<br /><br />But anyway, without talking too much s**t, my point is, is that he set
the bar pretty high for himself.<br /><br />Enter Inception&#x85; A film about dreams! It is set in the near future
where technology allows for people to invade another human&#x27;s mind
through his dreams. Now, Enter Leonardo DiCaprio, the best mind invader
there is, has to get a team together to do his toughest job ever,
inception, in other words, plant an idea inside a person&#x27;s mind through
his dreams. Blah blah blah, go watch the movie.<br /><br />Even though the complexity of the story and the nearly two and a half
hours of runtime, you don&#x27;t need to worry about ever being bored or too
confused. It keeps you intrigued the whole time, and although there
might be some confusing parts, you never get to the point where you are
completely lost in the complex storyline.<br /><br />Apart from the highly intelligent story, there isn&#x27;t much that is wrong
with this movie. The cinematography, special effects and CGI is out of
this world (literally) and it is like nothing you have ever seen
before. The sound effects &#x26; musical score also fits in perfectly.<br /><br />Inception also has a great cast. Leonardo is the s**t, Ellen Page
(Juno, Hard Candy, Xmen 3) &#x26; Marion Cotillard (Big Fish, and bunch of
French movies) are pretty hot and I am even starting to like Joseph
Gordon- Levitt (Brick, 500 days of Summer and the awful 10 Things I
hate about you). Also making an appearance is Michael Caine and Cillian
Murphy, who both also star in other of Nolan&#x27;s films.<br /><br />So, as you can see, I really really loved this film. Definitely my
favorite movie of 2010 so far, probably the decade with Inglourious
Basterds, being the competition.<br /><br />This really is nearly PERFECT Movie! I give it 10 out of 10 because
somehow 9 out of 10 doesn&#x27;t seem high enough.
