Not a big fan of Lost, but this is still a good movie. After my long
critique below. Just remember this: Its a very entertaining movie,
nonetheless. <br /><br />I think there&#x27;s a lot of similaritie with Lost, the two use a similar
formula. Note: Inception has a lot more action, though the action in
Inception seems planted and fake at times. (more on it later) <br /><br />Here&#x27;s how the formula works. Writers come up with a loose plot, with
multiple possibilities, and throw ideas on top of it. Here, it worked.
They constructed a pretty nice story, which is more like a piece of
abstract art than a well knit tale. This is no &#x22;Memento&#x22;, &#x22;Usual
Suspects&#x22; or &#x22;Vanilla Sky&#x22;. In those movies, you eventually understand
how everything happened. This is intentionally different.<br /><br />It has an open plot. Keeps you thinking. The story? Above average.
Think about it. The plot surrounding the action sequences is pretty
cookie cutter. A special team breaks in... type movie. The complexity
revolves around the sub-plot, Leonardo&#x27;s character, how do the two tie
together?<br /><br />The characters? C&#x27;mon. Not that good. There&#x27;s 1000 movies with more
emotion and more developed characters. This was built to be an
explosion-filled summer blockbuster. Do you always dream about guns and
explosions? I don&#x27;t. Apparantley every character in this movie does. I
just thought they could have taken the dreams in so many interesting
ways, but relied on the James Bond formula too much, for Summer ticket
sales. <br /><br />This movie has a unique hook. They want you discussing it. They want
you to try and figure it out. There is no 100% &#x27;accurate&#x27; solution to
how the two plots (mentioned above) fit together. It will leave some
frustrated with an empty feeling.<br /><br />Some of the characters were developed way too fast. I thought they
needed to spend way more time on Ellen Page and Decaprio&#x27;s
relationship. Ellen Page goes from innocent student to commanding
expert in no time.<br /><br />The movie thoroughly confuses you, then comes together. Or does it? It
leaves you thinking there&#x27;s more to it. And thats what they want.<br /><br />I think the action sequences are a little off. They give no reason for
why everyone shoots guns in dreams and behave like trained special
forces. Thats just &#x27;understood&#x27;. There&#x27;s quite a bit of this movie that
supposed to be &#x27;understood&#x27;. And you&#x27;ll be trying to understand it for
quite a while.
