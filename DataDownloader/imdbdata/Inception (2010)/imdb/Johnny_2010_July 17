IMDb, perhaps you should increase your rating scale to 11 since the
release of this movie. A longtime Christopher Nolan fan, I was
expecting this film to be better than I could imagine. It was; Far
better.<br /><br />Keeping this simple, Inception may very well be the best movie I have
ever seen.<br /><br />Seeing it on the Big Screen was an intense experience and I hesitate
recommending it to anyone who may become ill from intense action
sequences.<br /><br />If you are not one of these people and have not yet seen this movie,
then I pity you for not having seen it... YET! <br /><br />P.S. If you have never heard of Christopher Nolan, please, for the love
of god, search his name on this website and watch his other movies, he
has actually made more great films in addition to the one Heath Ledger
died shortly after making. ;)<br /><br />P.S.S To those who say Inception is not an original idea, DUH. Saying
Inception is a remake of Paprika is preposterous. Do you really think
that 2006 was the first time anyone had an idea like this??? Its called
execution.
