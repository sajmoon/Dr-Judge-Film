The title says it all, Noland did it again...after The Dark Knight, i
was questioning myself if Noland will ever make something better than
that, and yes he did it, that was sheer genius and sheer perfection,
not just the storyline was almost flawless, but the way he followed in
that absolutely outstanding movie. I have to admit, at first, i was
completely lost, i had no idea what the hell was going on, but thanks
to Mr. Nolan, he explained everything not just using words but with
scenes too, so i wasn&#x27;t lost anymore. Lets talk about the actors and
the actresses, and when i talk about that i mean Ms. Cotilard, she was
scary, moving, touchy, beautiful, everything about her was absolutely
amazing, she scared me somehow, Leonardo was great, his role reminded
me of his role in Shutter Island, but still good, Ellen was very good,
this girl can act, the rest were good too. Nolan is one of my favourite
directors and screenwriters, he is like the new Steven Spielberg for
me, once i finished the movie, i really wanted to go back and watch it
all over again, i advise everyone to watch that movie and you won&#x27;t
regret it, a once in a life experience. ;)
