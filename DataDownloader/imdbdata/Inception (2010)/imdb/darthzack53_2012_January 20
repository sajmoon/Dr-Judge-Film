To Be Honest This is one of the best films I Ever saw. It has Great
Acting By all the Cast Members.Some of the Most Awesome Visuals. And
Great Effects,Like the Zero Gravity Fight scene,or the amazing Dream
sequences. Hans Zimmer&#x27;s Score Is Beautiful ant some points And then
Action Packed at some points. Go Rent this movie If you Haven&#x27;t Seen
this movie,And if You Have seen this movie,Go get it on Blu ray or DVD.
This is the most awesome movie.Trust Me this film Is excellent. One of
Chris Nolan&#x27;s Best film Besides His Batman Films. Those are cool too.It
Deserves it&#x27;s 10 out of 10 i gave it.<br /><br />10 out of 10
