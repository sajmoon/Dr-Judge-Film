I have waited so long for a movie like this to come out. For the past
few years, it has been movies dedicated to ONLY special effects and
senseless action scenes. The world has been polluted by movies with
poor writing, and lazy over-used ideas. Some films which were called
the best were actually very boring, stupid and clich&#xE9; (EXAMPLES:
Avatar, Happy Feet, Transformers, etc.) Could it be that Hollywood is
slowly making a transition from lazy recycled remakes to original and
exciting motion pictures? Inception definitely gave me hope.<br /><br />I&#x27;ve heard many reviews on the Internet saying that this movie was too
complicated to understand. Well, I&#x27;m here to tell you that the people
who wrote those reviews are probably not very smart, or they didn&#x27;t
even try to understand it. There have been too many movies out lately
that shut down people&#x27;s brains, other than challenging them and making
them think. Inception is the first SMART movie I have seen in a long
while. Yes, it is a bit confusing at first, but the answers to our
questions are answered in the movie, and if your questions aren&#x27;t
answered by the time you walk out of the theater, you figure it out
later on your own. This movie makes you THINK. More movies coming from
Hollywood should do research on the writing and production of this
film, and take a few notes about how they could improve the quality of
movies in general.<br /><br />What also makes this movie so spectacular is that it is a movie about
journeying into three layers of a dream, and while you are watching it,
you feel like you are really in a dream in a dream in a dream. This
movie makes it feel like you don&#x27;t know if you are awake watching a
movie, or going deeper and deeper into a very epic and bizarre dream.<br /><br />I&#x27;ve always said that special effects aren&#x27;t necessarily important, but
they do add an awesome dimension to the film, making it feel real and
unreal at the same time. The action scenes are adrenaline-pumping, and
edge-of-the-seat exciting. Though there are a lot of talking scenes,
they are not boring. They answer our questions and once again, make us
puzzle out in our brains what is going on and where in the layers of
dreams are we and the characters in the movie.<br /><br />All this epicness and awesomeness is backed up by probably the best
acting I have seen in a non-animated movie in a while. Leonardo
DiCaprio and Ellen Page, I think, were the jewels in Inception&#x27;s crown.
They both did a spectacular job. I say Ellen Page should replace
Kristen Stewart&#x27;s spot in the Star Meter. She deserves it more.<br /><br />Brilliant writing, exciting action, puzzling, awesome, incredible,
suspenseful, and groundbreaking movie. Avatar has been called
groundbreaking, but is it really worthy of the title, &#x22;Greatest Movie
Ever Made&#x22;? Well, I and obviously Christopher Nolan say, &#x22;NO FLIPPIN&#x27;
WAY!!!&#x22; Inception owns, and don&#x27;t anyone who read this review forget
it!
