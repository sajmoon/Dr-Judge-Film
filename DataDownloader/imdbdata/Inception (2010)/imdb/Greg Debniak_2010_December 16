This is not my kind of movie. If I want to speculate on what is really
happening, I&#x27;ll read a mystery novel (something I almost never do
anymore). I don&#x27;t enjoy a movie that forces me to try and figure out
the plot. Not that it should be totally obvious from the beginning, but
this was just too much head work for me and I could tell that it was a
puzzler, early on.<br /><br />I go to the movies for entertainment -- not to solve puzzles. After 10
minutes I walked out. I was not entertained and I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be.
After seeing thousands of movies I can usually tell quickly if I&#x27;m
going to like it.<br /><br />But that&#x27;s just me. I can see how others thought this movie was great
but you must remember that it&#x27;s not for everyone. I&#x27;m not a fan of
Matrix or Tron either, so you can see why I&#x27;m not interested. Sci-Fi
and puzzles are fun for some... not for me anymore.
