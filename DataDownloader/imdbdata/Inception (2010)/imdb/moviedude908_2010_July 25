Inception is an amazingly complex and unique film. It has great action
and special effects, along with one of the most intelligent plot&#x27;s of
the year<br /><br />Inception follows Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio)a man who specializes in
entering peoples dreams through technology, to retrieve information
from their minds. Cobb is offered the job of inception from a powerful
businessman, Saito (Ken Watanabe). Cobb accepts the offer, and with his
team of dream architects and invaders, they attempt to accomplish the
near impossible feat of Inception.<br /><br />The acting in this film is phenomenally good. All of the leads do a
great job, and Ellen Page is exceptional as Ariadne, the young dream
engineer of the team. Inception is written and Directed by the very
talented Christopher Nolan, and I believe this film is far superior to
his previous films, namely The Dark Knight. It&#x27;s been said that it took
Nolan 10 years to write the script for Inception, and it really shows
in the quality of the dialogue and complexity of the plot. Nolan&#x27;s
direction is near flawless from the spectacular special effects to the
emotional climax.<br /><br />Inception is easily the best film of the year, and perhaps one of the
best films of the decade. This film is most likely going to be
nominated for several academy awards, and in my opinion Nolan should
win for best Director. The performances by some of the leads are also
worthy of a nomination. In a time where originality is rare in cinema
Nolan has crafted a very unique, complex film with inventive special
effects and great performances, Inception has it all. This film will
leave you in awe, and will have you going back for multiple viewings.
