I usually don&#x27;t care for sci-fi films like this because I always think
it doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense and has too many plot holes. But, if you
pay attention, the movie makes sense and you can follow it. It&#x27;s about
a guy, Dom, whom is an extractor, meaning, he steels secrets from
people when they are dreaming. There are all these different roles
involved to pull off a perfect dream. He&#x27;s hired to implant a thought
into a guy&#x27;s head and if he succeeds will be able to go back home and
be with his children.<br /><br />So, the plan is complicated, it actually involves 4 dreams within a
dream. And there are all these rules when dreaming. Like what wakes you
up and what sends your mind into limbo.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: Just pay attention, and you&#x27;ll like it.
