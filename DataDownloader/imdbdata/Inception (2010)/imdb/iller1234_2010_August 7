2010_August 7 
Saw it in cinemas a week after opening night or so. I couldn&#x27;t keep off
the 8 vote though i feel its a bit high.<br /><br />Short about the movie before i review it. Cobb - the main character,
played by Leonardo Di Caprio, is a former architect and accused for
throwing his wife out the window - literally, is trying to clean his
record with the police by doing a job for a powerful acquaintance(Ken
Watanabe - Saito) that involves dreamexorcism and the like. While
struggling with the mystic relationship with his former wife he puts
together a team of specialists to handle the job. Ellen Page plays
Ariadne, the gifted young architect. Tom Hardy plays Eames, the
&#x27;impersonator&#x27; if you will. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Arthur, in
charge of the technical aspects. They are all there to trick Robert
Fischer (Cillian Murphy) big time. By taking him through three levels
of dreaming they hope to alter the very core of his motivation and
change his future plans as a result. You will have the rest explained
to you, don&#x27;t worry about that.<br /><br />I&#x27;ve heard people saying they have to watch the movie 3-4 times before
understanding the story in full. In my opinion you have almost
everything explained to you just as it happens. This comes through in
discussions among the characters or with the camera itself. To clarify,
if you have to think about something for a moment because you didn&#x27;t
understand it fully the characters in the movie interrupts your thought
process by explaining exactly what just happened. I don&#x27;t mean to sound
arrogant at all but I have this problem with movies that tries to reach
out to everyone at once. If the aim is to include every watcher they
obviously have to explain things over and over in different ways. I
totally get that but it doesn&#x27;t fit well with a movie like this one, it
takes all the thought provocation and mysticism out.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t know if it was the overall Hollywood-humorous-mood of the movie
that made it difficult for me to take the characters seriously or if it
was just poor portraiting from the actors. It seemed more of a
kindergarten with Leonardo, the grownup, running around trying to calm
down the kids - Ellen and Joseph. More of a Harry Potter cast feeling
to it Im afraid. Im also disappointed to say that Leo had his worst
performance in a long time, if not ever. I&#x27;d think the manuscript was
aiming for a very emotionally moving struggle for the main character.
However Cobbs little misadventures wasn&#x27;t moving me one inch. Leos
acting felt empty and almost fake.<br /><br />Nolan tries to feed the watcher with a bit of everything, romance,
humour, action, sci-fi and psychology all at the same time but falls
short in every area. The actionscenes and animations are great though,
in line with almost all new movies from Hollywood these days. This to
me unfortunately makes Inception more of a hardcore actionmovie than
the thought provoking masterpiece I was hoping for.<br /><br />Now if you are one not particularly annoyed by areas discussed above
you wont be disappointed with Inception, you wont be anyway. The ideas
behind it are new, very interesting and thought provoking. I think
people will start investigating and experimenting with their dreams
just a bit more after seeing Inception.<br /><br />I know I do, and I like it :)
