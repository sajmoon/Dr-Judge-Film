The only moments that had dream-like qualities in the movie were the
times I dozed off &#x26; my own dreams (many times more imaginative I might
add) took over. <br /><br />To be blunt about it, Inception is not so much about dreams as about
the world of video games. Even more telling than the gratuitous CGI
effects was the clunky narrative device of having the characters
explain in overly verbose dialog where &#x26; when each segment was taking
place (levels, locations, psychological motivations, etc.). Like having
to follow instructions of a poorly designed game. Ugh. <br /><br />The popularity of this snoozer is very sad testimony to the mediocrity
of the average movie-going intelligence.
