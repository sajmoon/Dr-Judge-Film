Not only is inception a masterpiece of film, technology with amazing
directing and fantastic acting. It is one of the few movies that truly
affects you on deep layers of emotional and psychological levels. <br /><br />Beginning to end is a Non stop thrill ride of intellectual beauty, The
action is almost overridden by the sheer amount of brainpower used to
unravel the detailed and layered plot. While things are blowing up, the
viewer is still trying to figured out why it is even happening. <br /><br />It is one of the few movies you will need to see multiple times to
fully get a better grasp on. This film will hit you like a freight
train, Full speed without taking questions. There is not a single
second for Hollywood cheese. It amazes me that such a far out, and
original film was able to get produced with this much precision and
attention, With a decent budget while not going overboard with effects.<br /><br />Truly amazing, I left the theater with a higher perception about what
is possible in this fleeting reality.
