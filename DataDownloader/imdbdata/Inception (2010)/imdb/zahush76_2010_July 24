Just saw the movie yesterday and enjoyed it very much. In a world where
most people leave their brains outside the cinema, and come to the
cinema to escape - this movie is making them use their heads again. The
movie was very good, and it felt like i could watch 2 more hours of it
without feeling how time passes.<br /><br />BUT, the general idea isn&#x27;t that original, and has been done before, to
some extent. I&#x27;m talking about David Cronenberg&#x27;s &#x22;eXistenZ&#x22; from 1999.
On the whole, i think that there&#x27;s a flood of movies in the last decade
that deal with the question of how do we know if reality is really real
and how can we tell the difference (&#x22;Matrix&#x22;, &#x22;eXitenZ&#x22;, &#x22;Vanilla Sky&#x22;
and many others).<br /><br />Another good thing is that this is the one movie you can&#x27;t spoil to
others even if you wanted to. If you&#x27;ll tell someone the end - he won&#x27;t
understand. And if you&#x27;ll try explaining how it got there - you&#x27;ll make
a fool out of yourselves while trying...
