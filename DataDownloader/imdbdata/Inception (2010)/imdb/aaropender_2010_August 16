First of all, a pet peeve of mine is to read reviews that give away
more about a movie than they should. I will not do this here.<br /><br />At the time of the writing of this review, IMDb&#x27;s overall or average
user rating was 9.1. This is most likely among the highest of all
movies ever reviewed on this site.<br /><br />Before I paid theater prices (which are just generally too high) to see
this film on or shortly after its opening weekend, I checked the user
reviews posted here; which I remember as being very positive then, as
well.<br /><br />Much is made, in many of the reviews, about the plot twists and plot
layers. It is true that the film contains deep plot layering and a few
sharp twists, along with some pretty cool CG and &#x27;slow-mo&#x27; animations.<br /><br />The problem is that these are essentially all that the movie has going
for it.<br /><br />The underlying plot is not compelling. It is comprised, ultimately and
fundamentally, of a science fiction technique for one or more trained
people to enter the dreams of another, after all involved go to sleep.
Each person involved in the &#x27;dream-walking&#x27; process, including the
person whose dream the others are entering, must have some idea, before
sleeping, of what is about to happen. There are briefcase-sized
machines involved which must be hooked up to every person who wishes to
&#x27;share&#x27; the dream. (None of this spoils any of the plot&#x27;s fulcrums;
this is all simply underlying premise, those things on which the plot
fulcrums depend.) The above premise is the only original idea of the
film. After that, it&#x27;s just another action movie with a little bit of
psychology thrown in. It attempts to be a psychological thriller, but
it&#x27;s more of a psychological action film. The basic premise is not
compelling; and the plot twists and layers, which are supposed to be
the parts of the movie which &#x27;wow&#x27; viewers (and which most of the
reviews actually seem to be impressed with), are neither all that
original nor imaginative. The ideas behind the layers and twists are
fairly commonplace, considering many thriller or psychological type
films that have been made and released over the past few decades.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan has, in my opinion, through films made prior to
&#x22;Inception&#x22;, made a place for himself among the more original and
capable film directors. The first movie of his that I saw was
&#x22;Memento&#x22;. I think the only others of his that I have seen (before
&#x22;Inception&#x22;) were &#x22;Batman Begins&#x22;, &#x22;The Prestige&#x22;, and &#x22;The Dark
Knight&#x22;. Each of these is a very good - or great - movie.<br /><br />&#x22;Memento&#x22; gives viewers a fair idea of the kind of plot layering and
twisting that Nolan is trying to accomplish in &#x22;Inception&#x22;. &#x22;Memento&#x22;
uses a rather original and compelling storytelling device. Upon this
the film rests, and upon this the film succeeds.<br /><br />The plot of &#x22;Inception&#x22; rests upon this technique for entering dreams.
This is not that compelling; and the ideas, layers, and twists placed
upon this premise are not enough to pull it into the land of
storytelling greatness of &#x22;Memento&#x22;. They are not enough to give it the
appeal or draw of the plot of the great &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22;, which
constantly had viewers concerned for the citizens of its setting; and
which caused viewers to always wonder what horrible, deadly scheme the
story&#x27;s antagonist was going to pull the protagonist into.<br /><br />&#x22;Inception&#x22; is a movie that is no better than most other action movies
with a psychological bent. The layers DO require a person to devote
full attention to follow. The many plot elements also call for viewers
to have a modicum of intelligence or a bit of learning in psychological
or consciousness theory. Without these things, a viewer will not truly
appreciate what is going on, and will be left to trying to enjoy the
action and special effects.<br /><br />Perhaps because it demands viewers&#x27; attention and thought, the movie is
better than most products from Hollywood. I suspect that it is due to
these demands of the film that it has been rated so highly by so many
IMDb reviewers. It must be better than at least 60 or 70 percent of
Hollywood&#x27;s garbage - most of which which I have deliberately missed,
and against which I am mostly unable to compare &#x22;Inception&#x22;; but that
doesn&#x27;t make it a great or &#x22;perfect&#x22; film.<br /><br />In this way, the movie is almost certainly better than MOST Hollywood
products. However, likely due to their points of comparison, IMDb
reviewers have provided this film with a rating that is so high as to
be inaccurate and misleading. It is, in the broadest land of Hollywood,
above average. It is NOT good or great, or anything above those levels.<br /><br />Save your money and DO NOT watch this at a full-price theater, unless
you&#x27;re just so steeped in material possession that you simply don&#x27;t
care about $8-10 or more per ticket. It is much easier to appreciate
this movie as part of a Netflix queue, or at the cost of a Redbox
rental - especially with a setup that will do full justice to some of
the cool CG ... though, frankly, pretty much everything from Hollywood
is full of cool CG these days.<br /><br />Ultimately, Nolan will be remembered for &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22;, &#x22;Memento&#x22;,
and perhaps for future films; but not for &#x22;Inception&#x22;. Over time,
&#x22;Inception&#x22; will fall from the minds of film viewers, though it seems
to hold a place at the forefront right now. Hopefully, he returns to
form. I expect him to.
