A film that proves how skillful and how creative a filmmaker can be.
Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, Memento) shows us a film that mixes
both fantasy and reality to tell a philosophical story about dreams and
the mental ability that we have to create and control our own world
within our mind. This is a film that takes us into the world of the
subconscious where memories, feelings, and thoughts influence our
behavior without us realizing it.<br /><br />Nolan has made some true masterpieces that changed our perspectives on
life and this is one of them. We notice how imaginative this modern
filmmaker can be with just one simple idea and how it can change
everything...
