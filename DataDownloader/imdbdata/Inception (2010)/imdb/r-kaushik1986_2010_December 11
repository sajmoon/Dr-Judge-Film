Inception,definitely is a good film.But not at all one of the best
films ever.<br /><br />Everyone who watched this movie will feel the
genius,brilliance,excellence etc..,of the director Nolan.(Believe
me..Most of them thought themselves a Genius because they understood
this film !!)<br /><br />If that is the only criteria required,then scientists of NASA can be
the top directors in Hollywood.<br /><br />This movie is like a puzzle(i mean &#x22;satisfaction-both sides&#x22;)
category.I don&#x27;t know if there is a genre called &#x22;puzzle&#x22;,for which
smart fellows(&#x22;let them assume&#x22;) can give a total 10 for this kind of
movie.<br /><br />Really it doesn&#x27;t belong to top #250 category at all..(At present,I am
really hating this movie just because it is above Schindler&#x27;s List)
