If you want to see 120 minutes of beautiful camera work and great
scenery this movie is for you. BUT... this was no more than watching my
grandchildren with a video game! Not even a great game! The premise was
good BUT the action that followed was similar to a
looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong car chase! Too bad such an
interesting premise was
elooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooongated into two and half
hours. The first 15 minutes were provocative and the last 15 minutes
were interesting BUT the two hours in between felt like six hours. I do
not recommend this movie for thinking people, only if you have two and
half looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong hours to spare.
Otherwise, go see a good love story.<br /><br />-Movie critic par excellence
