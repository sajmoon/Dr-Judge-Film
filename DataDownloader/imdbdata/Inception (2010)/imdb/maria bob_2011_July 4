Inception is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I
would prefer watching the human centipede a million times than to have
to sit through Inception again. It was an insult to my intelligence. It
was pretentious. It was horrible. There has only been one other movie
that has made me want to walk out and that was the Blair Witch Project.
I couldn&#x27;t understand how anyone could possibly find that movie scary.
We see movies like that on youtube all the time now.<br /><br />Inception was ridiculous. The plot was horrible. The entire movie was
just terrible there is no other way to describe it. Nothing made sense
I have absolutely no idea how anyone can like this movie.
