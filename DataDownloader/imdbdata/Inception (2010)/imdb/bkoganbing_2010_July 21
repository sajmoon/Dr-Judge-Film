Watching Inception with its futuristic emphasis on getting inside
people&#x27;s heads through dreams, especially hearing Leonardo DiCaprio
explain the pitfalls to newbie Ellen Page, I couldn&#x27;t help thinking
about Forbidden Planet and that warning about monsters from the Id. Did
earth manage to conquer what the Krells could not?<br /><br />Christopher Nolan wrote and directed Inception and though it gets a bit
heavy at times, it still is an unmistakable masterpiece. Leonardo
DiCaprio stars in this and he&#x27;s essentially a cat burglar of the mind.
His mission usually is to invade people&#x27;s dreams and steal ideas which
makes him an invaluable espionage agent. But Leo&#x27;s also a wanted man.<br /><br />Some problems Leo has relating to his Id have forced him to rely on
others to create dream worlds. He was working against Japanese
billionaire industrialist Ken Watanabe and got caught, but then
Watanabe likes his style and hires Leo and his team to do a job on the
young heir to a communications conglomerate, Cillian Murphy. It&#x27;s not
to steal anything, but to plant an idea in his brain with the dream
team. The film is essentially how DiCaprio and his crew go about this
job with Watanabe incidentally along for the ride. And its how Leo has
to deal with some real demons involving guilt that force him to rely on
others.<br /><br />Very nice computer graphic generated special effects characterize
Inception and it will probably earn an Oscar nomination next year in
that category. Director Nolan gets his talented cast to read writer
Nolan&#x27;s dialog with verve and conviction. <br /><br />I truly hope this technology is not in our near future that would be a
frightening thought.
