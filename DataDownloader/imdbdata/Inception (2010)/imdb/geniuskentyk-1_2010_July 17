&#x27;Inception&#x27; is an amazing, imaginative, innovative, clever,
exhilarating, and (there are way too many positive adjectives to
describe the film) bad-ass film. I think Christopher Nolan has finally
found, no, created, his magnum opus - an amazing feat, considering how
early Nolan really is in his directorial career.<br /><br />In &#x27;Inception&#x27;, director Christopher Nolan takes us into a world where
entering peoples&#x27; dreams is a reality. In this world, there are people
called &#x27;Extractors&#x27; whom are able to enter peoples&#x27; dreams and steal
any type of information from practically anyone. Leonardo DiCaprio&#x27;s
character, Dom Cobb, is the most skilled Extractor, and he has a very
important job to do - a job that the basic plot revolves around. Dom
Cobb is hired by a very powerful Japanese businessman, Saito (Ken
Watanabe) to do the impossible - implant a brand new idea into another
person&#x27;s mind; this task is called inception. The target is another
businessman, a rival of Saito&#x27;s, named Robert Fischer, Jr. (Cillian
Murphy). The task of inception requires in-depth planning, and requires
experts in a variety of fields. Thus Cobb must assemble a team of top-
notch professionals in those certain important fields.<br /><br />The remarkable Joseph Gordon-Levitt portrays Arthur, Cobb&#x27;s right-hand
man, and has the important task of researching and learning about his
targets. The lovely Ellen Page portrays Ariadne, an architect whose
sole responsibility is to create the complex world of the dream. Tom
Hardy portrays Eames, a wise-cracking shape-shifter, of sorts. And
Dileep Rao portrays the chemist, Yusuf, who provided the special drugs
that enabled everyone to enter dreams - he&#x27;s also important for driving
that van; you&#x27;ll know what I&#x27;m talking about.<br /><br />Cobb&#x27;s team is amazing, and each and every one of them is unique and
likable in their own ways. These characters&#x27; unique-ness and likability
is helped by the fact that they&#x27;re portrayed by a bunch of strong
actors and actresses. The ensemble cast in &#x27;Inception&#x27; truly is
remarkably strong and superb. So many characters in &#x27;Inception&#x27; are
portrayed by well-known actors and actresses that I&#x27;m glad none of them
were wasted. From the trailers, I figured the characters of Saito
(Watanabe) and Fisher, Jr. (Murphy) would have minimal screen-time,
because I figured their characters (the former the client, the latter
the target) just wouldn&#x27;t be focused on as much. However, I&#x27;m glad I
was wrong. Watanabe&#x27;s character stuck around for the entire film, and
is actually important, though you won&#x27;t know it till the end of the
film. And Murphy&#x27;s character was also featured a lot and important to
the overall movement of the plan. Gordon-Levitt&#x27;s Arthur is very
charming and goofy, and the funny scenes that were actually included in
&#x27;Inception&#x27; were all funny because he was in it.<br /><br />I loved Ellen Page&#x27;s character. Christopher Nolan was actually very
smart for putting a character like Ariadne in the film - her character
helps us understand the film better. Since Ariadne is new to the
concept of entering other people&#x27;s dreams (as are we) and all of the
complex rules that apply to them, it&#x27;s extremely helpful when she asks
questions since she&#x27;s as confused about certain things as we, the
audience, are. Page&#x27;s Ariadne is like our senator or representative for
the film, since she practically does represent us, and raises the same
question as we do.<br /><br />The complexity of &#x27;Inception&#x27; is purposely frustrating and confusing.
The film works because of that. And I love movies that make the
audience frustrated and make them have to work with the movie in order
to enjoy it (if they&#x27;re done right, which &#x27;Inception&#x27; definitely did).
Films like &#x27;Inception&#x27; are more enthralling when they&#x27;re challenging,
because you become even more satisfied when you actually succeed in
understanding them.<br /><br />The only major problem I had with &#x27;Inception&#x27; was the fact that many
times I couldn&#x27;t understand what Saito was saying, and most of the time
he was saying something important. It&#x27;s important to pay attention to
every single line spoken in the film, so when I couldn&#x27;t understand
Saito in his many important scenes, it left me clueless and confused.
Also, I couldn&#x27;t get over the fact that Saito promised Cobb that he
would be able to fix all of Cobb&#x27;s problems with just one phone call.
How is he able to do that? Although I&#x27;m disappointed that the film
never really explains this, I think it&#x27;s actually better that it
didn&#x27;t.<br /><br />&#x27;Inception&#x27; is a near-perfect film, and requires multiple viewings to
truly understand its complexity. Christopher Nolan is an amazing
director who hasn&#x27;t made one bad film yet! I trust his ability to
continue this streak. Freaking-A! I cannot get over the very final
scene of &#x27;Inception.&#x27; That final moment, I think, was the perfect way
to end off the film. It&#x27;s the kind of ending that will frustrate
people, but it&#x27;s also the kind of ending that&#x27;s debatable, and is
either praised or hated. I, personally, loved the ending. However, I
did, along with almost everyone else in the theater, go &#x22;Awww&#x22; and
&#x22;Omg&#x22; after that last, important scene. I just love how that ending
teases everyone. &#x27;Inception&#x27; definitely lives up to, or even surpasses,
the hype surrounding it! The film is amazing on multiple levels, and in
multiple ways, for multiple reasons. It&#x27;s the movie of the summer. It&#x27;s
the movie of the year. And, quite frankly, it&#x27;s one of the best movies
of the decade.
