Another great movie by Nolan, just as thought-provoking as The Dark
Knight.<br /><br />Through the whole movie, you can&#x27;t help but to continuously ask
yourself the question, &#x22;Is this real?&#x22; The movie underscores some of
humanity&#x27;s most deepest themes of hope, faith, and love.<br /><br />DiCaprio&#x27;s character hopes to go home, he believes he can and pursues
that goal because of his love for his children.<br /><br />As I watched this film, I couldn&#x27;t help thinking about the &#x22;idea&#x22; that
there may be more to life than this one. In the movie there is a kind
of hell and also a kind of heaven. The film plays with the idea that
the first step in making the hope (the &#x27;idea&#x27;) that your life can be
better into a reality is to believe it can (faith). Love is the action
that makes it happen.<br /><br />Sometimes we need help from a friend... we need someone to go with us
into the depths of our subconscious, where we carry all our pain, and
plant the idea of hope... that the life of regret we are living is not
one we are enslaved to. We can escape and live a better life if we can
only have the faith to try.
