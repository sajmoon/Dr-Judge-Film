2010_July 18 
in summer filled with crappy films n mindless stories inception stands
out as it is one of the few films(apart from matrix)that mixed style
with substance.i just couldn&#x27;t help but clap at the end of the movie
the sad thing was my fellow audiences didn&#x27;t share my enthusiasm but
its not meant for your avg dumb audience who loathes in mindless
films.but for thinking audience this is like a buffet with all you can
think theme.never before a movie made me so engaged in the dynamics of
the plot that i almost forgot where i was as my mind was in a a race
against the characters of the movie to breakdown the schematics of this
labyrinthine yet emotional nature of the story unraveling in front of
me.the story is so complex to explain that one needs a paper and pen to
illustrate the ongoings.the actors were pitch perfect no complains
about that. the screenplay is breath taking considering all the
explanations that nolan gave i was never bored but intrigued.the set
pieces were just jaw dropping and the photography of wally pfister just
transcends you to the surreal world.being a huge fan of hans zimmer i
had lots of expectations and he didn&#x27;t disappoint but i feel he had
less to do because unlike dark knight this film needed less elevation
from the score as the story and screenplay were enough of holding your
attention.yes,it does have some loose ends in being very complex rasing
far too many debates about the ending.but i guess thats what nolan
wanted us to do.kudos to nolan for coming up with such original
idea.this is one movie you shouldn&#x27;t miss it requires multiple viewings
to grasp the idea.at the end of it i have only one question who is
responsible for the &#x22;INCEPTION&#x22; of this idean in nolan&#x27;s huge brain.
