So you can enter somebody&#x27;s dream and plant an idea and then watch it
develop into some big world changing decision/event. Well honestly I&#x27;d
rather have telepathy to enter somebody&#x27;s thoughts where I could do a
whole lot more but that&#x27;s not exactly what Inception is about. If I
follow the story it was about planting the seed of doubt in a
competitor&#x27;s mind so he would sell him company or something like that.
I found a lot of things in this movie pointless and how exactly can u
have a dream within a dream within a dream? Isn&#x27;t that like saying I&#x27;m
eating a meal within a meal within a meal? Seriously if this was all
the studio could come up with I&#x27;d rather watch Superman stop a bullet
with his invulnerable eye again and again and again.
