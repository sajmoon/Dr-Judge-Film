I tried not to let the preposterous build up and hype for this movie
influence me before I watched it. I&#x27;m glad that I did that because my
expectations really weren&#x27;t that high. As a result, I enjoyed this film
quite a bit. I&#x27;m not sure about its &#x22;rewatchability&#x22; but it certainly
keeps you interested throughout. It&#x27;s captivating on two fronts. One,
the story itself and two, the fear that there&#x27;s something else going on
and that the &#x22;other shoe&#x22; could drop at any minute. Nolan plays it
masterfully. There were shortcomings for me, however. Minor
inconsistencies (falling &#x22;kicks&#x22; were happening every five seconds) and
shifting between dream world and movie world time frames made it
awkward at times. Also, the action sequences featured that poor shaky
cam quality that I&#x27;ve really come to loathe. There was even some poor
use of the steady cam on regular shots. Minor quibbles aside; I loved
the theme they tackled and the trippy nature of the film itself. Anyone
that has lost someone close to them knows the frustration of trying to
keep a firm memory and those little nuances of them alive. For me, the
bizarre concept and why they can even do what they do is secondary.
What carries the film are great performances mixed with an emotional
impact mixed with its unique plot angle. While not THE greatest thing
ever put to film as some may suggest, it certain was an entertaining
film to say the least.
