This is an existential film; the plot and the depth of the complex
themes in the film are well explained (moving it away from a David
Lynch-style film), the character development is focused on the
protagonist and this is fine as there is plenty of depth and &#x22;levels&#x22;
to deal with. Despite preferring the Matrix (it draws reference to the
Matrix in a brilliant executed hallway scene). This film also has a
romance subplot as well as a clever use of dream levels which I felt
was well done and relatively unique. Coupled with the incredible
cinematography and acting I thought this was a polished picture with
plenty of joys and interpretation.
