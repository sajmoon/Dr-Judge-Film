2010_July 16 
Never have I been unimpressed with Nolan&#x27;s work (althought I&#x27;ve only
seen three of his movie before Inception). I have never been so hyped
up about a film in my life (except for Avatar and The Dark Knight). Leo
DiCaprio is one of my favorite actors, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is one of
my favorite new actors. The cast was great. Hopefully this movie will
get some acting nominations at the Oscars. <br /><br />The action was great, the pacing was superb, it&#x27;s everything I could
ask for a movie and more. I really loved the climax of the movie. I
only could wish it&#x27;d be a little longer (which is a sign I love a
film). It&#x27;s now my favorite movie ever, even though I had some doubts
about it before. <br /><br />Anyway a solid 10/10. The best movie this summer (besides Toy Story 3).
This movie will get a considerable amount of attention at award shows,
I can tell.
