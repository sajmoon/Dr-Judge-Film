Christopher Nolan never ceases to amaze us, with such hit films like
Memento(2000), Insomnia(2002), Batman Begins(2005), and lets not forget
The Dark Knight(2008). And with Inception he proves that he never seems
to outdo himself.<br /><br />The story begins a group of special agents led by Cobb(Leonardo
Dicaprio), who have a device that helps them enter a persons mind, and
get information, while not trying to get lost in the dream state. But
Cobb is growing weary, and wants to retire, and go home to his kids.
But his boss(Ken Watanabe) wants him and his team for another
assignment, and promises him it will be the last. But will they make it
through? <br /><br />A wonderful tale mixed with science fiction,adventure, and quite a good
human drama. Christopher Nolan blends them together perfectly. Also
great performances by Leonardo Dicaprio, Joesph Gordon Levitt, Ellen
Page, Cillian Murphy, and Tom Hardy. It also had amazing effects. If
you&#x27;re in the mood for a sci-fi drama, then go check out Inception.
