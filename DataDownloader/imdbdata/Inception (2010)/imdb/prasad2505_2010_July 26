I guess everybody would have written about this flick by now. What can
i say new about this? As like everybody, I am no exception. I was drawn
by the charm which Nolan created once again.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan with his own story after his debut &#x22;Following&#x22;, shows
the world why he is smarter than others.When James Cameroon spent 10
years in creating a technical marvel, Nolan believed his brain. He too
created a marvel, may be not in the technical side, but with his true
script.<br /><br />Inception is a spiritual journey where Nolan is the god and we are the
disciples. One thing where Nolan scores more than any other director of
our time is the way he narrates the story. We don&#x27;t have enough time to
think.You need a second viewing for sure, to truly appreciate the
nuances he has put in the flick.<br /><br />As somebody rightly said, Inception is not immune to spoilers. You
can&#x27;t tell the story without revealing the story. In a nut shell, its a
story about planting an idea in one&#x27;s mind through his dreams. Having
said, its not so easy. The design they create , the perfect execution,
the haunting background score, the slick editing, amazing camera work
and last but not the least the fiendishly clever script makes it a
master piece.<br /><br />If Matrix is the best sci fi film made in the last decade, then
Inception is the one for next few decades. On a whole, Nolan&#x27;s movies
may seem like a movie with lot of technical finesse and some great
twists which qualify for a decent thriller. However all his movies, on
its bare bones have an emotional underlying story why his protagonist
wants to do that. And that justification, makes him a genius. Take a
bow Sir.<br /><br />As an ending note, please stop reading the spoilers. Its no bad if you
missed something. I watched twice still i have a book of unanswered
questions. I will watch it again. If you are reading the spoilers, you
are not thinking smart enough. In the era of just teen comedy,
meaningless sequels and millions of dollars spent on blowing up
buildings, Inception wins hands down as a summer blockbuster and a
perfect movie to test your acumen. To sum up, Inception - Mind-bending
Visual Spectacle.
