Another phenomenally over-hyped blockbuster from Nolan, which - like
all his movies - is nothing else but a pseudo-clever, emotionally cold
and pompous high gloss product that&#x27;s masquerading as intelligent
mainstream entertainment.<br /><br />It&#x27;s such fun to watch all the movie geeks and oh-so literate critics
(and almost everyone in between) fall for well-packaged, but thoroughly
trivial nonsense like this with such aplomb. It&#x27;s as if all the stupid
action movies and (romantic) comedies Hollywood is churning out
regularly have led to a yearning for something more profound... though
the big guns and larger-than-life stars are still not to be missed, of
course.<br /><br />This one&#x27;s in the same league as &#x22;Matrix&#x22;, though much more elaborate
in its twisted ways. (Just listen to the constantly exchanged plot
explanations between the characters, which get unintentionally funny
after a while.) <br /><br />One watches pics like these applauding the makers, without investing
deeper thoughts or emotions. One&#x27;s much too puzzled to feel anything.<br /><br />By the way, this must&#x27;ve been the longest showdown I&#x27;ve ever seen in
any movie. Afterwards, I felt like that ancient Asian guy.<br /><br />5 out of 10 ever-whirling roundabouts
