What a movie!!!!!! I went crazy when I moved out of the movie hall
feeling, whether we are still dreaming, and will wake up in some
reality some other day. Some were thinking shall I sleep again? Will my
sleep turn out to be a nightmare? A movie which can change your thought
process. Can there be a better example. Superbly thrilling, and
unbelievable storyline. Leonardo DiCaprio shows his capability
stupendous role. The whole gang he brings together fit in so nicely to
their roles.<br /><br />Apart from everything else, Mr. Nolan&#x27;s brilliant mind, and
storytelling. How can someone do so much as making the movie of the
millennium with a concept of dreaming? Its a humble request, don&#x27;t miss
the movie, its once in a lifetime :)
