I will make it short: it is a nice, mind-boggling move, not more not
less. We have seen people chasing each other on skies in the mountains
already at least once in a James Bond movie and this is also not the
first movie about dreams, manipulating peoples minds etc. The case is
good, sci-fi effects are state of the art, but this is it. This is not
a movie I will still think of in a week from now, a similar movie that
really stuck to my mind was &#x22;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&#x22;, a
lot less (if any) special effects, but very subtle. Still this is
probably the best movie that is currently in the cinemas and it is
worth seeing.
