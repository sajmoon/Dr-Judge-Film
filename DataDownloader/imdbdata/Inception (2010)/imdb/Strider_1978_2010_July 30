It doesn&#x27;t go any higher than a 10, or I would have gone higher.<br /><br />I&#x27;m not going to go into this because other people who have already
presented views will probably say it better. I cannot say that I really
&#x27;understood&#x27; the story or sub story or spiderweb, but that did not
really matter. What we have is a fantastic piece of art/entertainment
but together by a master. This is a film for those that desire more
than popcorn in a film. It is a film for those who want to watch a
&#x27;good&#x27; film.. no an &#x27;excellent&#x27; film and have their intellect stroked.
It is a technical eye popper, and most likely an academy award winner
in several aspects. If I have to pick and flaws, I have say that
DiCaprio needs to stop elevating his voice because it takes away from
his performance. There is a difference between showing emotion and
shouting. I saw this on IMAX, and I can tell you it is absolutely worth
the admission with several scenes.<br /><br />It would be an injustice not to go and see it, so what are you waiting
for? :)
