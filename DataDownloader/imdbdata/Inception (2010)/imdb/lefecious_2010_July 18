Christopher Nolan is one of the few filmmakers in the world today with
the ability to make a big budget blockbuster that is truly original.
Inception is like nothing you have ever seen before. The plot involves
a world where the technology exists to allow people to invade the
dreams of others. This technology has a practical use if you make your
living stealing ideas, like Leonardo DiCaprio&#x27;s character does.<br /><br />Beyond that, I won&#x27;t say anything about the plot because the less you
know going in, the better. I will say that the story is nothing short
of incredible. I can&#x27;t imagine the amount of work it took to write such
a complex script and still have it all come together neatly with zero
plot holes. I have this image in my head of Nolan drawing these massive
flow charts with a thousand bubbles on a giant dry-erase board.<br /><br />This film will please every kind of moviegoer, from the average-joe who
likes action and special effects to the hard core film nerd that likes
to analyze every second of screen time, this movie works on enough
levels to please them all.<br /><br />Nolan does require of his audience the ability to pay very close
attention for the entire 2.5 hours, but if you give him that, he&#x27;ll
take you on an incredible journey. Inception is truly one of the best
films ever made.
