Overly long...could have easily had 30 minutes cut...and I would have
given it a 7 at 2 hours of length. The first 90 minutes a bit slow in
several parts (looking at my watch, shifting in my seat), but then it
picked up. Overall, I would characterize it as a slower version of &#x22;The
Matrix.&#x22; The visual effects were stunning, the premise quite creative,
the acting and direction excellent, and it likely employed enough CGI
people to populate a small city.<br /><br />Some parts, however, were very hard to follow, esp. in the second half,
although if you did pay attention you can get most of it. The absolute
adulation it&#x27;s getting is--and an overall number 3 on Top 250
IMDb.com--just inSANE! I think this is just a LOT of people wanting to
be seen as cool and hip. But really folks...I enjoyed &#x22;Toy Story 3&#x22;
more. I must give the weightlessness special effect special mention
along with a fight scene with shifting gravity. Nicely done...<br /><br />All-in-all, there are worse ways to spend 2.5 hours...listening to an
Obama speech, for example...<br /><br />See it soon if you want to be the first one on your block, but keep
your expectations within reason and you won&#x27;t be terribly disappointed.
