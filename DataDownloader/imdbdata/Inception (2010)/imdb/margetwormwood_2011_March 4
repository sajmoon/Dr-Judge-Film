Dom Cobb leads a team specializing in stealing secrets from people&#x27;s
minds by entering their dreams. When they are hired by a mysterious
businessman, Cobb finally has a shot at redemption, but not before
achieving the near impossible. Rather than stealing an idea, they must
do the complete opposite: Inception. Planting the seed of an idea.<br /><br />It focuses on the emotional journey of its lead character, Cobb, but at
the same time thrusts the audience into multiple levels of action
packed story- telling, very distinct from one another, but all finely
connected. Director Christopher Nolan challenges the audience to keep
up, and rewards those who can with a breathtaking spectacle, one that
has the capability to leave you awestruck. The best part about it is
that while you may feel you need to watch it again to be able to fully
absorb the experience, chances are, you will probably want to.<br /><br />While it may seem simple at its outset, Inception is an extremely
complex film, delving deep into the subconscious of the human mind.
Technical brilliance and visual splendor have rarely blended together
as beautifully. It&#x27;s a film that manages to engross you with its
complexities, yet comes together seamlessly, and will have you at the
edge of your seat, quite literally from start to finish.
