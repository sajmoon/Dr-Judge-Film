2010_July 17 
In the spirit of full disclosure I am a Chris Nolan fan boy who was
patiently awaiting this release for the last couple years. While it is
an exceptional ground breaking film, it sadly did not live up to my
expectations. An 8/10 from me is normally a very high compliment coming
from me, as I&#x27;ve only given out a handful of 9&#x27;s and 10&#x27;s, but this is
a movie that could have been so much more.<br /><br />I actually got very excited when I read some reviews here on IMDb
suggesting parallel&#x27;s to Paprika (or saying Nolan flat out ripped the
movie off, actually according to Wikipedia this script has been in
development for over a decade). Paprika&#x27;s dream world was flat out
insane and took multiple viewings to really dive into the nuances.<br /><br />The dream world in Inception, in my opinion, is all too real, while it
deals with manufactured dreams I would expect a dream world to be
riddled with contradictions and nonsense. I left the theater feeling
like I got the entire movie, whereas going in I expected to leave in a
daze eager for another viewing to try and figure things out. It&#x27;s not
often I want a movie to be less coherent and logical, but with the
nature of the subject matter I really expected nothing less.<br /><br />That said this was a bold movie for mainstream Hollywood to make, there
has never been anything like it shot in live action. The cast was
phenomenal, not a single weak link. Even the extra&#x27;s acted well. Ellen
Page&#x27;s performance really stuck out, she&#x27;s on her way to becoming a
super star.<br /><br />The cinematography was spectacular with even the few scenes dealing
with dream-induced pseudo-reality seeming oddly real. What is amazing
is that the movie was shot in analog and not digital, non-technical
people may not grasp just how impressive that is. Nolan likes the
higher film quality and I think the results speak for themselves.<br /><br />Nolan has delivered yet another groundbreaking top-250 hit and
continues to expand a resume that is starting to challenge that of the
likes of Kubrick and Hitchcock.
