I confess I saw this flick at the theater the day it was released
because I had seen the trailers and believed all the hype.<br /><br />Its been a while since seeing the movie, here is what I remember. Its
full of amazing special effects, and begins well and I remember feeling
that it was going to be a wonderful movie. However, I left disappointed
and angry that my hard earned money had been wasted. <br /><br />Who the heck voted for this garbage movie to be on this list of &#x22;Best
Movies of all time??? Morons who haven&#x27;t seen any of the hundreds or
thousand of better movies than this polished pile of fecal matter. <br /><br />The plot is too slow, there&#x27;s too much emphasis on special effects, and
although the concept is somewhat original the movie could have been so
much better had the dialogue/dialog been more interesting and
believable. <br /><br />Maybe, I am in the minority, I just hate this movie, and I don&#x27;t like
that fact that its gets so much praise! Do you people really think this
is one of the best movies of all time? <br /><br />It should not even be in the top 100 much less the top ten!<br /><br />Don&#x27;t see this movie. It&#x27;s 128 minutes too long with only 2o minutes
that is actually worth watching! <br /><br />Don&#x27;t waste your time with this garbage.Do something more productive
like reading a book, clipping nose hairs, vacuuming a beach... anything
other than watching Inception<br /><br />Good Grief!
