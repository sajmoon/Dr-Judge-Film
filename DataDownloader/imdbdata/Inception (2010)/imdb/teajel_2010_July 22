Finally a great and superb summer blockbuster has arrived after months
and months of expected it Inception is finally arrive to live up this
summer to be a worth waiting film in summer as well the best i&#x27;ve seen
it so far after a lot of crappy remakes,stupid sequel,mindless comedy
that fill up the world of summer cinema now Christopher Nolan rescue
this summer by making this intelligent and unforgettable film after he
make his first rescue in summer 2008 by re-decorates batman movie into
astonishing dark knight and now he&#x27;s rescue again with inception his
best movie yet.<br /><br />Inception is definitely a worth watching for from start to finish with
an interesting and intriguing character plus an intelligent script that
shaped the whole perfectly written stories inception really live up
it&#x27;s both promise and premise as a film also as a blockbuster from the
great script and a story that almost like a novel to me and with mind
blowing both special effect and the visual effect not to forget the
brilliant cinematography where in every scene that was shoot perfectly
even without the 3D camera even without that kind of expensive toys
inception still brilliantly can deliver all of the effect clearly and
with a lot of cool slow motion captured that was used in this film that
make inception clearly a big budget blockbuster with story and
character like a novel and a script that brilliantly intelligent what
more did you ask for and as for the acting i remained speechless about
it even with or without an Oscar nomination Leonardo performance is
going to be remembered in both film and his career history and with the
supporting role that as good as it can be with a young talented actor
like Ellen page and grade a upcoming actor as Joseph Gordon Levitt and
Marrion cotillard that live up the character really well there&#x27;s no
doubt that this is really a playground for all the talented actor out
there. so with an almost perfect script,brilliant cinematography,great
musical score from always the brilliant hanz zimmer,very polishing and
astonishing visual and special effect and a unbelievable performance
from Leonardo and friends what more did you ask for so grab a popcorn
with your favorite soda and bring friends with you and let film doctor
Christopher Nolan heal your need for quality entertainment with his
twisted mind blowing almost perfect science fiction and let&#x27;s hope this
win for an Oscar
