Boring movie with no meaning and only a few fancy special effects.
Special effects were not even all that good. Just a few slow motion
anti-gravity scenes. Even the Matrix would have been boring without
some kind of &#x22;meaning of life&#x22; stuff. You need more than star power to
make a good movie. I kept thinking the movie would have intriguing
thought provoking idea, but it was so predictable. It turned into a
real snooze. The premise of the movie is not enough to carry the entire
movie. Using dreams to influence behavior is a concept that has been
used many times effectively. Such as SG-1 when the Harcesus teaches
Daniel that power would corrupt him through a dream. But this movie has
no uplifting message.
