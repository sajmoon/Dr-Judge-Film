So anyway, I went to see Inception last night at the cinema. Was
totally blown away.<br /><br />I then came home and had a look on IMDb to see what other people
thought. I found it fairly shocking that people had decided to rate
this film 1/10 and other equally low ratings.<br /><br />Sure, you can compare this film to Kubrick&#x27;s work if you like, but how
is this film anything like what he&#x27;s ever done? It&#x27;s not.<br /><br />I think a lot of people like to think they &#x27;know film&#x27;, but really
they&#x27;re just sheep. Hear how they harp on about very popular &#x27;masters
of film&#x27; such as Kubrick and Hitchcock, and don&#x27;t get me wrong I loved
The Shining, 2001 was a bit boring really wasn&#x27;t it unless you were
born in the 60s seeing it on acid, rear window was cool as was south by
south west.. but wait, this film had awesome action and AN AWESOME
PLOT.<br /><br />If you like a good story, then go see this film. If you&#x27;re more
interested in how well somebody is acting, what &#x27;the director was
thinking&#x27; etc.. go see something else and really have a think about why
you watch films in the first place.<br /><br />I was tempted to give this a 10/10 to offset the stupid hateful reviews
a bit but I resisted. I also started thinking about how IMDb should re-
think it&#x27;s rating system. I think the rating of a film should also take
into consideration it&#x27;s release date as a weighting to the total
average.<br /><br />Anyway, if you have an open mind, go see this film!
