2010_August 3 
Not the very beginning, but about 10 minutes or so into the movie, I
didn&#x27;t know what to think. I felt like a lot was left out and I was
going to be pretty confused. But it picked up very fast and got to the
main part making the rest of the movie pretty much perfect in my eyes.
The excitement was just too intense at parts. The suspense had me at
the edge of my seat at times wondering what I was going to see next.
The ending was one of the best parts. Watch and you will see. The
writers really had something going here. The ability to control yours
and others dreams. To bring a team into someones mind and help control
their dream. The ability to make a dream, within a dream. This really
was written by great minds and Nolan really directed it well. The movie
is just shy of 2 and a half hours, but it doesn&#x27;t really seem like it,
because you will enjoy this film. The cast was excellent. Leonardo
DiCaprio was great. Ellen Page was also a great second. Cillian Murphy
stayed more quiet, but still could act. My medal of great acting has to
go to Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Never thought I would see him in such a
fighting type role, but it really fit for him. Unfortunately, Tom
Berenger gets the award for not acting as well. I think he is just
getting too old maybe. This movie has some great action shots and the
CG is pretty good too. Pure suspense from start to finish. Great film,
great cast, great writing.
