I like Christopher Nolan. He a good director. His little movie here,
Inception, is one of those movies that give you brain burn. Allow me to
explain! <br /><br />A rag tag team of handsome thieves invade people&#x27;s dreams and extract
memories. But for some reason implanting ideas in someone&#x27;s head is
super hard? No it&#x27;s not! Hypnotist do it all the time. Then this Arthur
character says &#x22;The dreamer can always remember the genesis of the
idea. True inspiration is impossible to fake.&#x22; Also, not true. People
get source amnesia all the time. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve met someone who claims
to have invented a joke or a phrase that they actually heard from
someone else. <br /><br />And these thieves are trying to get some wealthy hot-shot to shut down
his bidnass? There&#x27;s an easier way to do that that doesn&#x27;t involve
dream invasion. Wallstreet does it all the time. If some butt-wipe is
getting too powerful, just bust him for any number of egregious crimes
in which super wealthy billionaires inevitably get themselves involved.
Or frame him and arrange some kind of take-over. 10000000000 times
easier. <br /><br />Additionally, there are plenty of cheesy Hollywood shootouts where the
bad guys can&#x27;t aim, and cars function perfectly fine after being filled
with bullet holes. You could say the cars still work cuz it&#x27;s a dream,
but then why do shot up people get totally screwed? I can overlook
these ridiculous elements in a Jean Claude Van Damme movie by simply
turning off my brain, but that&#x27;s exactly where everything goes wrong in
this movie. <br /><br />Ya see, if this was a comedy, everything in the story would work. But
it isn&#x27;t a comedy, is it, homies? heck no, son, it&#x27;s a psychological
thriller! So it&#x27;s meant to stimulate your brain, but all the
absurdities mentioned above ask you turn your brain off in order to
enjoy it. So the constant turning on and off chafes your brain. Brain
burn.
