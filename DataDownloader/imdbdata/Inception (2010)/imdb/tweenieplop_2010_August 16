If you like Leo&#x27;s acting, sci-fi, the Matrix and just generally good
films, then go and see Inception.<br /><br />A really clever concept, which kept me glued to the screen. I even
cried at one point, but I am a big emotional wreck, haha!<br /><br />It&#x27;s a cracking film with extremely clever special effects. The casting
is good and the acting is second to none. I thought it would be more
mindbending, as the Matrix was, but it was an easy concept to get my
head around, which in turn made it more enjoyable to watch as you could
possibly see something along these lines taking place in the future in
some form or another...<br /><br />Definitely worth a watch!
