2010_July 20 
Without exaggeration,i can say I had never waited for anything in my
life like i waited for Inception.I was keeping update of every single
development and news about the movie,i can say i was getting hysterical
,and the reasons are quite clear as both my favorite actor and director
of my generation ,Leonardo Di Caprio and Christopher Nolan come
together ,my favorite newcomer actors Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon
Lewitt they are all together in one movie,it is like a dream come true
and the movie itself explores the world of Dreams,the boundless world
of dreams where you are free from any limitation of real world to
imagine and create anything you want.It is action,sci-fi,romance,you
find everything here,every grand scale entertainment that we experience
from watching different movies brought in a single movie(as Chris Nolan
said),a movie we all dreamt about and Christopher Nolan made it real.<br /><br />When the movie released and after reading dozens of reviews,i came to
decision that i will not see this movie till the hypes get over so that
i could make own point-of-view on the movie.But i was unable to control
myself.Now,the movie has released in my city,the dubbed version
actually,in Hindi and they also renamed it in Hindi as &#x22;Chakravyuha&#x22;
which means &#x22;Labyrinth&#x22; which also seemed quite sensible to me.The
dubbing was perfect,with brilliant translation and synchronization, and
the selection of voices for actors were also fantastic.In short,they
didn&#x27;t spoiled the movie like they did to Harry Potter and Avatar .We
watched the movie in empty cinema hall(there were only 40-50 peoples
present in the capacity of 300) which was not surprising for me,as no
one care much about Christopher Nolan movies here,except few movie
aficionados like me.<br /><br />Watching Inception was the experience like seeing a miracle from you
own eyes ,a entertainment for your mind, body and soul.This movie
satisfied me completely from every point of view,like i said before
this movie is a complete package,this movie makes us think deeply and
explores subconscious of human mind and make us realize the power of
it.The completely original and personal work of Christopher Nolan with
some inevitable influences of other movies like Matrix but this doesn&#x27;t
make this movie unoriginal ,the idea of traveling into the subconscious
of human&#x27;s mind and steal his idea or even seeding an idea in his
subconscious is completely new,mind-blowing and ground-breaking
concept,the brilliant action and chasing sequences maintained adrenalin
rush in your body,and also a very heart-touching love story that
doesn&#x27;t seemed out-of-place but the vital part of the movie.This
brilliant concept get the full support from Warner Bros. who can take
such a high risk and give full freedom to their director,grand scale
production which made the sets and special effects looks so real.
Brilliant performances from every single cast as they were portraying
the beautifully created characters with such depth that made their work
very challenging.The soundtrack of the movie is mesmerizing and added
great feel to the movie.<br /><br />Inception may not be the best,may not be the most perfect and flawless
movie ever made but certainly it is the most complete grand scale
entertainment movie,so far.
