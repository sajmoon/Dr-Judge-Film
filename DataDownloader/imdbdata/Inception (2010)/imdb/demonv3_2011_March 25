Christopher Nolan is a true legend in the film industries, he has
redefined how other directors will approach movies for future
generations to come, with movies such as Memento, The Prestige etc. and
now Inception, Christopher Nolan is full of masterpieces. Inception
right from the opening scene pulls you straight in, right from the
beginning you are trying to work out what is actually going on, you
have to think! And that is how all movies ought to be. The icing on the
cake for this movie was Hans Zimmer&#x27;s music which fit the movie
perfectly, the soundtrack I actually own personally and listen to
frequently. A movie that makes you question life as a whole and
question what&#x27;s real and what&#x27;s not is always going to be explicitly
intriguing, think of the very first Matrix, where you left the cinema
thinking to yourself...What if?
