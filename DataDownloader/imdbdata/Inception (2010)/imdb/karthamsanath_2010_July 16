Nolan has delivered yet another masterpiece and without compromise. i
thoroughly enjoyed this movie, but I don&#x27;t think everyone would
actually get to know about the full movie when you watch for the first
time. Indeed it keeps you occupied by thinking, not that its actually
confusing but its a movie with a futuristic thoughts which is a little
hard to get over. Leonardo has come with such a stunning performance, I
would rate this is his best flick even though he has proved what he is
capable of in movies such as The Departed and Body of Lies. This is
sure to be summer blockbuster and going with expectation will not help
the audience in any case because what you think is not what you going
to see on the screen, its what you see on the screen makes you think of
what it is. This is definitely a very different movie all together.
Still I wonder some of them have voted from 1 to 5.. guess they never
understood right from the start of the movie. This is the one movie you
don&#x27;t miss and DO WATCH IT IN THEATER.
