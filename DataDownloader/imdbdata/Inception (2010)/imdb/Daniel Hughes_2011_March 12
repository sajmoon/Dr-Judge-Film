After seeing this film, my sponge hadn&#x27;t absorbed all the water. But
the water it got was great.<br /><br />So I went to see it again.<br /><br />And here I am, having preordered the limited edition case that now
stands proudly on my chest of drawers, with my new shiny Hans Florian
Zimmer t-shirt, the soundtrack CD, having watched every Chris Nolan
interview the internet has to offer, probably able to lip-sync the
majority of the film.<br /><br />GO NOW AND SEE IT<br /><br />I&#x27;m not a &#x27;fanboy&#x27; for no reason!
