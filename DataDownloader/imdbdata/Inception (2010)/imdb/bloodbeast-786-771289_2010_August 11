i saw this movie weeks after its release while hearing about all the
hype of how good it was but i was skeptical, now it takes a lot to make
me cry in a movie and i almost cried in this not because it was sad it
wasn&#x27;t but because it was sooooo good. Easily the best film of the year
if not the last couple years, if this doesn&#x27;t win an academy award i
don&#x27;t know what will, the plot is stunning the action is top notch, one
of if not the best movie I&#x27;ve ever seen and I&#x27;ve seen thousands im a
movie buff. Worst part about this site is the ten line minimum for
reviews so i will just ramble on and on and on again inception
excellent movie should be viewed by everyone.
