Once in a while, a film comes along that not only takes the cinematic
world by storm, but also rewrites the rules of movie making altogether.
Christopher Nolan&#x27;s latest project, Inception, is one such achievement.
Nolan had previously directed the masterpiece, The Dark Knight. That
film gave us a whole new look into what a Batman film could be like.
But with Inception, he creates something so new; so fresh and original
that you wonder if even he fully understood it.<br /><br />Inception is a film about dreams. Dreams are complex, surreal, and full
of mystery; all traits that this film also exhibits. In Inception,
Leonardo DiCaprio plays an agent who penetrates people&#x27;s dreams. He is
after their secrets, and the dream state is when people have their
mental guard down the most. The problem is that anything can happen in
a dream. We&#x27;ve all had dreams so we know this. This movie introduces
the notion of what it would be like if other people were actually
allowed in our dreams. Using the best special effects available, the
production team has done their absolute best to portray dreams in a way
that makes sense to the viewer, but still comes off as fantastic and
incredible.<br /><br />I should warn you: the plot is not easy to follow. One critic who
reviewed the movie wondered if it was too smart for general audiences
to grasp. Personally, I found that regardless of how complex the
storyline got, it pulled off the miracle of not seeming overwrought or
unmanageable. This is clearly the trait of a director who has mastered
his craft. However, a captain is only as good as his crew. The cast of
this film seemed quite committed to the job at hand, and much of the
supporting cast (which includes such talented actors and actresses as
Ellen Page, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Michael Caine, and Marion Cotillard)
did just as great a job as DiCaprio. All this just goes to show how
every little detail was treated with equal care and how flawless the
whole production is.<br /><br />Some film buffs will argue that classics ceased to to be made years
ago. I certainly don&#x27;t agree with them, and this film is my proof. It
also proves that even the biggest summer blockbusters can be
intelligent and artistic. If The Dark Knight was the revolution, than
Inception is the reign established afterward.
