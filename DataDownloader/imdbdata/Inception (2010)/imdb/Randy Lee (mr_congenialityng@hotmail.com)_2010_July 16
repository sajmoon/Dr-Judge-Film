I won&#x27;t describe the plot, I won&#x27;t describe the characters, I won&#x27;t
describe anything about this movie. You&#x27;ve seen advertisements for this
movie. They are freaky, complex, mind-bending, but nothing in these
advertisements make sense, and they won&#x27;t until you actually see the
film.<br /><br />Nevermind the visuals of the film. They are not even the most effective
thing of this film. Granted though, they are a spectacular sight, and I
never thought for one second I was looking at actual CGI. That&#x27;s SUPER
effective. Nevermind the acting in the film. However, I never once
thought I was actually watching people act, I actually thought I was
looking at something real. The most effective point of the film is an
idea, an idea that takes our brains for a wicked little spin. This idea
entertains us, intrigues us, and plays fun little games with us. It&#x27;s a
sheer delight.<br /><br />A lot of people are going to ask &#x22;Is this film better than Nolan&#x27;s The
Dark Knight?&#x22; In my personal opinion, yes. This is his best film, and
it is better than &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22;, which was a masterpiece itself.
I&#x27;m proud to say that &#x22;Inception&#x22; is a step up. For those who are
looking for something simple, something plain, and something that won&#x27;t
require a grand extent of their brain power, they will get bored with
&#x22;Inception&#x22;. This is an adult film in the regard that it requires your
full attention, and your brain must be plugged into it, or you are
going to miss it ALL OF IT.<br /><br />I believe that this film definitely deserves a place for the &#x22;Best
Picture&#x22; nomination at the Oscars this year, along with more
recognition to Nolan as a director and a writer, for he has made the
most original film I have probably seen in a very long time. His
writing is impeccable. His direction is brilliant. His movie is the
ultimate masterpiece.<br /><br />Inception is the smartest $160 million dollars that a studio has ever
spent to make a film. It was also the best $7.50 I have ever spent.
Bravo.
