First off let me explain my style of critiquing a movie. When I go see
a movie I judge it by how entertained I was during and after the movie.
Most of the time I am not bothered by little plot holes and slightly
above average acting. However if I see extreme plot holes and terrible
acting (Nicholas Cage) I will bash those aspects of the movie.<br /><br />From the very beginning of the movie it is obvious that Christopher
Nolan has done it again by choosing the musical genius, Hans Zimmer.
His sudden changes from epic and loud music to a faint violin or piano
truly take this movie to the next level. The final song fits so
incredibly well with the ending of the movie that it has given me
chills *five* out of *five* times...<br /><br />Clearly any movie that makes a person see a movie five times has good
acting, right? Correct. Such good acting that it doesn&#x27;t even seem like
acting in the slightest bit. Leonardo DiCaprio and his supporting
acting group act at such a high level that is seems that the person
watching the movie isn&#x27;t even watching the movie. Every time I have
seen the movie I have felt like a member of Cobb&#x27;s(DiCaprio) dream
crew. All of the actors and actresses in this movie deserve an academy
award for this movie.<br /><br />You know what supports great acting? A story. An emotional story. An
emotionally thrilling story. An emotionally thrilling story that has
twists and turns. Inception is just that. The relationships between
Cobb(DiCaprio) and Mal(Cotillard), Cobb(DiCaprio) and Ariadne(Page),
and Robert Fisher(Murphy) and his father(Postlethwaite) were so
emotionally convincing that the entire audience would hold their breath
when each pair would talk to one another. I can honestly say, without
ruining anything, that I was teary-eyed several times during the movie.
The plot of this story is done so well that I have been left speechless
and confused after each of my 5 experiences with this movie.<br /><br />Stop reading this now and go watch Inception now...<br /><br />PS: Christopher Nolan, congrats on the greatest movie of all time. I
believe that your film will be the film that finally surpasses The
Shawshank Redemption as the number one film on IMDb.
