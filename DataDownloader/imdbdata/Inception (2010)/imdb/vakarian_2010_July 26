First thing I wanted to do after i watched the film is to thank Mr.
Nolan and the whole cast of the film.You should do it too because Nolan
made a film that will intrigue(yes,i like that word)your mind.<br /><br />Inception is all about your mind and dreams.Dom Cobb(Leonardo Di
Caprio) is a &#x27;extractor&#x27;.He steals ideas from wealthy businessman and
he is absolute best in it.Of course,one day a Japanese businessman
called Saito(Ken Watanabe)orders Cobb to to exactly opposite of
&#x27;extraction&#x27;.He wants to do &#x27;Inception&#x27;,to plant an idea into subjects
mind.<br /><br />I was impressed by films plot and pleasantly surprised by the
ending.Acting is good,as expected from Di Caprio,Ken Watanabe,Joseph
Gordon-Levitt,Elen Page,Marion Cotillard...<br /><br />Please,do yourself a favor and go watch this movie.You won&#x27;t regret it
I guarantee you that.<br /><br />10/10
