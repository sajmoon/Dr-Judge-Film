Inception proves the point that a Hollywood film can move beyond mere
entertainment and challenge the viewer to wonder &#x22;what the f*#^ is this
all about?&#x22; One can&#x27;t argue that the cinematic medium makes passive
audiences of us all. Countless movies &#x96; comedies, dramas, westerns &#x96;
you name it, we viewers plop into our seats, chomp popcorn while the
action unfolds and carries us to the rolling credits, snapping us out
of our trance. Christopher Nolan&#x27;s tour-de-force isn&#x27;t your usual heist
film. Sure, some of the elements are there &#x96; an international group of
thieves, the Job, and a ticking clock deadline. After that, it&#x27;s a
whole different type of film altogether. Described as a &#x22;sci-fi heist
thriller&#x22;, Inception demands a lot more than blink-blink, chomp-chomp.
The drive-by summary is: The Job - Cracking into a grieving energy
mogul&#x27;s (Robert Fischer, played by Cillian Murphy) unconscious mind to
plant an idea.<br /><br />The Thieves - Led by guilt-ridden Dom Cobb (DiCaprio), the Team swells
to include point man Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), architect Ariadne
(Ellen Page), chemist Yusuf (Dileep Rao), forger Eames (Tom Hardy), and
mega-rich client Saito (Ken Watanabe). They must share a drug-induced
dream down three levels, something that hasn&#x27;t been done. Each member
of the team &#x96; except Saito and the sleeping Fischer &#x96; carries a totem,
a special item that reminds them they&#x27;re in a dreaming state.<br /><br />The Ticking Clock Deadline &#x96; Extraction, the act of removing ideas from
someone&#x27;s mind, is the standard practice among the world of corporate
espionage that Cobb inhabits. This two-level process requires the
Architect to build a complex world of mazes that the team can move
about in freely, as the team descends deeper into the levels of shared
dreaming. The Chemist provides the powerful sedatives as the Point Man
keeps track of the &#x22;kicks&#x22; meant to move closer to the waking state. A
Forger can replicate into someone else, for the purpose of misleading
the potential victim. Inception &#x96; the job that Mr. Saito is paying for
&#x96; requires the team to enter a third level, which is considered a risky
and unstable realm to control.<br /><br />Are you still with me? What moves Inception beyond the Sci-Fi heist
genre is the underlying dramatic obstacle that threatens to engulf Cobb
into a permanent fourth level of sustained madness, along with his late
wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard) &#x96; and puts the entire team into harm&#x27;s
way. One aspect of this &#x22;dream-within-a-dream&#x22; environment is that
injury can occur, which awakens the participants, but death is the
&#x22;risky factor&#x22; in a third level. Cobb &#x96; on the run after being blamed
for Mal&#x27;s death - agrees to the job after Saito promises to clear his
name, so he can return home to his waiting children as a free man.<br /><br />The puzzle for Cobb is that he uses his free time to enter a fourth
level of dream state because it seems more real than his life without
Mal. When is he awake? Is it when he&#x27;s dreaming? Cobb&#x27;s subconscious
longings and obsessive day-dreaming allows Mal to freely wander into
the job, as a seductive wild card that endangers the entire assignment
at every level. Ariadne&#x27;s task is compounded as Cobb looks to her for
guidance to sort through the complex network of sorrow and desperation,
while seeking to bring the job to a successful conclusion.<br /><br />This reviewer loves this film so much, simply because Inception dares
the audience to fully consider this multi-dimensional experience. The
only drawbacks are the casting of Marion Cotillard as Mal and Leonardo
DiCaprio&#x27;s occasional over-acting. Ms. Cotillard&#x27;s constant refrain of
&#x22;you promised&#x85;&#x22; begins to detract from her otherwise adequate
performance after the third time. It wouldn&#x27;t grate on our nerves if
she had varied her delivery just a bit. As for DiCaprio &#x96; after almost
22 years of experience he still has a problem with key scenes that
demand intense emotion. Hanging out of a window, melodramatically
screaming &#x22;Oh my God, no!&#x22; leaves one wondering why this otherwise
gifted actor can&#x27;t move beyond such overblown histrionics.<br /><br />It took nine years of film experience and research for Christopher
Nolan (The Dark Knight, Memento, The Prestige) to bring his ideas about
lucid dreaming to life as Inception. The film takes place across
England, France, Tokyo, Tangiers, Los Angeles, and Canada, as the Team
races to the heart-hammering finish. Nolan&#x27;s film boasts a flawless
musical score, countless special effects and elaborate sets, not to
mention a script that demands the viewer see the film at least twice to
truly relish this unique cinematic creation. While such ho-hum movies
like The Social Network may scoop up awards this year, rest assured
that Inception will be viewed, imitated, and written about for decades
to come.
