With Christopher Nolan&#x27;s The Dark Knight, making Inception is another
big step towards the Oscars. Although Nolan did not get nominated in
2008 for The Dark Knight, directing Inception will definitely give him
a boost in the category. A story taken in a place where we can go into
people&#x27;s dreams and control them completely. Just like Nolan&#x27;s previous
work, Memento, Inception&#x27;s script is complex yet very entertaining and
easy for the audience to understand. Intellectually, Inception is a
very high-class film, but the film also demonstrates its dramatic side
in which Leonardo DiCaprio comes in. The cast delivered with a sense
that they knew exactly what was going on and Joseph Gordon-Levitt added
the fun element to the film. Inception is mind-blowing, visceral, and
smart, at the same time delivering the biggest Hollywood blockbuster of
the year. OscarBuzz: Best Picture (like Avatar last year), Best
Screenplay, Best Director (maybe), Best Support Actor - Levitt (good
chance), Best Actor - DiCaprio (maybe), Technical awards (total
domination)!!!
