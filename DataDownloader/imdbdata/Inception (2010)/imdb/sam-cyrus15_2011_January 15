I think this will be the one of the best movie of the decade,OK
century.This is the best film i have seen in my whole life till now.It
contains all elements of a movie should have.It has everything you
want.Many of them claim that avatar is the best film.Avatar is just
some kind of animation 3D movie.Nothing special in this movie.I have no
idea anything about inception i have not seen any
trailers(honestly).After watching i was thrilled.This movie will win in
many awards in many categories.Leonardo DiCaprio best film after &#x22;The
departed&#x22;.I m going with 10/10.If anyone like sci-fi films The matrix
trilogy,dark city,eternal sunshine of the spotless mind then please
don&#x27;t miss this.
