&#x22;Inception&#x22; is a 2010 film that stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph
Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Marion Cotillard, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe,
Cillian Murphy, and Tom Berenger.<br /><br />Since so many people have seen and are seeing this film and have
reviewed it, I won&#x27;t rehash the story.<br /><br />I found it an extremely well acted, fascinating, suspenseful film, and
I loved the concept of going into the subconscious dream state, and the
idea of dream vs. reality and which is which.<br /><br />The best thing about this film for me is that, as a classic film
aficionado and not being an expert at things like wormhole movies,
parallel realities, etc., I actually could follow this one without
having to go to the IMDb board or look online to find out what the heck
it was about. After Mulholland Drive, I spent hours on the Internet,
and then I had to watch it again. A great film but man was I lost.<br /><br />I&#x27;m sure this sounds funny to many young IMBb members, who see this
kind of film all the time, but this Casablanca fan gets confused
easily. For that, I thank writer/director Christopher Nolan, whose
scripts for &#x22;The Prestige,&#x22; &#x22;Memento,&#x22; and &#x22;Batman Begins,&#x22; I
absolutely loved. He&#x27;s really a favorite.<br /><br />Another favorite of mine is the ever-boyish Leonardo DiCaprio, who is a
wonderful actor and gives a great performance in his role, ably
supported by the always excellent Marion Cotillard, Cillian Murphy (a
new favorite), and the rest of the cast.<br /><br />Someone somewhere who hated this movie said that anyone who thought
Nolan was trying to say something serious is crazy. I don&#x27;t know if he
was or not, but I think the whole subject of the subconscious and the
dream state and creating a reality are intriguing topics. Many do
question is our whole reality on earth is a dream. Not sure &#x22;Inception&#x22;
really answers that, but it&#x27;s an absorbing film.
