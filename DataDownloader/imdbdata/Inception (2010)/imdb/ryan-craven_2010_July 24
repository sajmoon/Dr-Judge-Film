I was worried that I would be sitting in the cinema for 2 and a half
hours not having a clue what was going on, but actually, the film made
more and more sense as it went on, and the idea was completely and
utterly infectious, I couldn&#x27;t help but sit there and be amazed by it.
The central performance by DiCaprio was fantastic, putting in his heart
and soul into it, and he led it with such gravitas and gusto. <br /><br />The supporting cast were good too, all very well executed, but it was
DiCaprio most wanted to see. The action sequences brilliant, with a
gravity defying hotel room fight being the pick of the bunch. Nolan&#x27;s
perception and execution of a genius idea is wonderful, anyone else
would have seen it and said &#x22;this is unfilmable&#x22;, but not him, he
tricks us all with this, taking us one way, then turning sharply the
next. But inception isn&#x27;t flawless. The first 30 minutes I found were
difficult to work out, which wasn&#x27;t a bad thing, it was a good
beginning, and it set the tone for the rest of the film, and I
understood that Nolan wasn&#x27;t going to give us time to think. As it went
on, it slowly unravelled itself, and I understood, to a degree. As well
as that, there wasn&#x27;t a lot of laughing to be had, the humour was few
and far between. But that depends on what you were expecting. For what
it is, Inception is probably the best in the genre yet.
