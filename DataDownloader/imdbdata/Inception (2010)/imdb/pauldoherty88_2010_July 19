Just caught inception last night, and what praise to be said that
hasn&#x27;t been said already by the true movie and cinema goers.<br /><br />Let&#x27;s start with the Director: Christopher Nolan has once again raised
the bar, anyone going to inception that has read a review of it will
have extremely high expectations, like I did, but as with the Dark
Knight I went in expecting a Ten out of Ten film and was more than
satisfied. The things that you see on screen will defy logic and one
scene in particular will let you know if you any underlying &#x22;Vertigo&#x22;
that you didn&#x27;t know of. As with the Dark Knight Nolan highly utilises
the sound, giving him the ability to keep you on edge and feel the
tension in the more sedate moments of the film. As for the story,
prepare to have your mind fried, in a good way. I think there should be
an I.Q. test administered before the film starts, but no matter your
level of Intelligence everybody comes away with a slight different
interpretation of what it means.<br /><br />The lead actor: Leonardo Di Caprio(potentially the next De Niro, Since
Ed Norton seemed squander the early promise he showed). As of late it
seems that Leo is the go to guy to lead a film, and he doesn&#x27;t
disappoint here, conveying a great ability for the job that he does in
the film but always letting you know that there is more to him than
meets the eye, that he is carrying a heavy burden.<br /><br />Support Cast: Ellen Page, Marion Cotiliard, Cillian Murphy, Ken
Wattanabe, Tom Berenger, and a brief Michael all provide solid
performances and go to show how powerful Nolan is that he can pull in
so many stars. But of the support cast there are two stand out
performances: 1.Tom Hardy as Eames: Having yet to See Bronson I can
only base my opinion on Hard from this Film, and my opinion is High, he
is cocky arrogance is great but we know he can back it up with great
ability to execute the task at Hand. 2. Joseph Gordon Levitt: The Dark
horse of the film, potentially stealing the best role from Di Caprio.
Whilst Di-Caprio is the Lead, Levitt his right hand Man is tasked with
the more difficult elements of the mission and the Gravity/No Gravity
fight will make your Jaw drop. Levitt has been showing promise since
&#x22;The Lookout&#x22; and especially &#x22;Killshot and has finally fully delivered
in this movie. Hopefully from now on we will refer to him as &#x22;The guy
from Inception&#x22; and not &#x22;The kid from Third rock from the sun&#x22;.<br /><br />To summarise, the film will blow and fry your mind and will satisfy it
on every level, Films like this are the reason to go to the Cinema.
