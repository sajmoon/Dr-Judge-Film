This is not just a film, its more an experience that you will remember
and tell your children when they grow up. I personally believe that
this is Nolans first film worthy of every Oscar nomination, simply
because you have 1. Best Actor-Dicaprio at his best playing a character
he has only similarly portrayed in shutter island, a broken man but
still with something to lose. 2. Best Actress-Marion Cotillard with an
inspiring performance as Cobbs wife who wont let go of her dream life.
3. Best Director- Christopher Nolans moving sets, need i say more!. 4.
Best Picture!!!!, 5.Best Musical Score by Hans Zimmer and so on and so
forth. Honestly if my opinion means anything towards you&#x27;re opinion in
seeing this film then i beg you to take my word for it. This film is an
astonishing achievement from the best director of the decade!!!!!!
