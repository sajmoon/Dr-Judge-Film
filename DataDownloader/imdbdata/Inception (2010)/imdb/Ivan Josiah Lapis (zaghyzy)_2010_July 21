I simply can&#x27;t express how great this movie is! The concept was very
well done and executed including how they managed to effectively
visualize parts of the concept. They were also able to sum up the core
ideas at the beginning which aids the viewer in understanding how the
rest of the movie works. It may seem like a brain workout, but it&#x27;s
not. You need to learn the simple base concepts to understand the movie
and that&#x27;s it. If you further delve deeper then you&#x27;ll see the true
beauty of this movie and how it&#x27;s complexity provides a stunning
experience you simply won&#x27;t find in any other movie. There is great
respect for both realism and the dream part where you as a viewer could
also feel how intense the movie is. The movie is a definite must watch.<br /><br />This movie is for everyone! And I would really want everyone to watch
this! If you ask me, I&#x27;d watch this over and over again....<br /><br />P.S. I liked the concept very much. However, with how great this movie
is, please don&#x27;t make any sequels. A spin off should be fine I guess
but no sequels please.
