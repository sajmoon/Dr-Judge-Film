I had the honor of seeing a pre-screening of this film tonight in
Dallas. Now, I have seen lots of movies in my time, but this movie is
by far...excellent. I am simply amazed at Christopher Nolan for
blessing us with this film...i truly am.<br /><br />The trailers can only give you so much and I&#x27;m so glad they don&#x27;t go
too much in depth with the plot. You are literally drawn into the
movie.<br /><br />Acting=10, Cinematography=10, Story/Plot=10, Mind Stimulation=10+ I
cannot wait to read more reviews on this film. It was well worth 2+
hours and I am positive that I will be seeing it AGAIN later this week
when it opens in theaters.<br /><br />GO SEE IT.
