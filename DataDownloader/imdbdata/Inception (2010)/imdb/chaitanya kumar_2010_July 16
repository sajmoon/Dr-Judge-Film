Nolan does it again and this time he knows he can get away with it!
Inception is one of those mind numbing movies that demand a lot from
the viewer and pushes the boundary of imagination. Dealing with dreams
and memories is not something new for Hollywood(read matrix, esotsm,
what dreams may come, cell etc) but where inception stands out is the
brilliance that only Nolan can lend to the story and the execution. <br /><br />The visual effects, the acting, the cinematography, the story telling
and more has just keen kicked up a notch! In many of his movies, the
characters or say the protagonist is shown with a shortcoming or a
secret that he/she needs to overcome and inception is no different! Di
Caprio plays Cobb; a thief of a different kind who specializes in
entering peoples dreams and extracting secrets. Fate has it that to
overcome his fears and get back to his family, he is forced to perform
inception, a dangerous process that involves planting new ideas into a
subject after entering his/her dream. What follows is a complex and
twisted story of dreams within dreams, blurred visions and powerful
imagination.<br /><br />It is always important to weave a story no matter how complex around
simple realities that are &#x22;more&#x22; human than what the story highlights.
Nolan does it by focusing on Cobb and his psychological challenges of
dealing with simple emotions like love, guilt and redemption. This is
where the story becomes indulgent when we see the director trying hard
to keep the audience rooted to the story but not often able to do so. <br /><br />Any artist can only go as far as his imagination takes him and cannot
possibly predict the depths that the mind of his audience can reach.
Nolan certainly pushes his imagination with Inception and teases his
audience to do better. Inception might need more than one viewing to
comprehend the hidden nuances but whatever be the case, the movie
certainly leaves you grappling with your own dreams and realities. <br /><br />Surely a little self-indulgent but somehow, nobody seems to bother!<br /><br />ps: the movie ends in typical Nolan style but somehow one knows how it
ends in &#x22;his&#x22; mind!
