One of the worst trends in cinema over the last few years is the number
of blockbuster films that have been devoid of plot. The majority of the
big summer movies could have a plot synopsis written on the back of a
business card. As the cinema screen explodes in front of your eyes, you
long for a word containing more than two syllables.<br /><br />Inception is a break from that tradition and for that alone it must be
commended. The film follows Cobb (DeCaprio) who can extract information
from people by breaking into their dreams. He is tasked with performing
the more difficult task of planting an idea into a dream - The
inception. He gets together a team of people who will help him
accomplish the mission.<br /><br />First the bad news. I didn&#x27;t particularly feel any emotional investment
with any of the characters. The film doesn&#x27;t really have goodies and
baddies in the traditional sense. That is not a bad thing, but I simply
didn&#x27;t care very much what happened to any of the characters.<br /><br />Now for the good news. The script and acting are all first rate. The
effects are also very good and you have to say that Christopher Nolan
is building up a great cv. DeCaprio must be a contender for next years
best actor Oscar and it would be surprising if he doesn&#x27;t get at least
a nomination. The supporting cast are also good and I&#x27;ve always enjoyed
watching Ellen Page.<br /><br />The best thing of all about the film is the ending. Pure class.
