&#xA8;Dreams feel real while we&#x27;re in them. It&#x27;s only when we wake up that
we realize something was actually strange. &#xA8; Inception is one of the
reasons I love movies so much. This is a really intelligent and smart
film that never fails to entertain with amazing visuals, good action
sequences, and an excellent cast. Christopher Nolan is without a doubt
the best director in Hollywood right now. Nolan&#x27;s worse reviewed film
is The Prestige and that movie was brilliant so that is saying a lot
about a director who seems to turn everything he touches into gold. He
revived the Batman franchise making it more realistic and believable
and made an even better sequel. The Dark Knight was a character driven
film that studied the psychological consequences behind each action,
Inception is a very different kind of movie that focuses more on the
storytelling than on the characters themselves. When Nolan was
approached by the studio to try to make it in 3D, he declined saying he
wanted the audience to focus on the storytelling and not be distracted.
3D serves for movies that don&#x27;t have a smart plot and only want to
focus on the visuals, however Inception works so well and the visuals
are so amazing that they are better than anything I have seen on 3D
(yes including Avatar). Even so, the special effects aren&#x27;t the reason
why this film is so engaging. The reason people want to see this over
and over again is because Nolan has written a smart plot which took him
more than 10 years to write. It is a movie with several layers and
depths, a film that you won&#x27;t want to take your eyes off the screen for
even a second, it engages you from the very beginning and draws you
into it, it is like a maze you need to solve. In a summer full of
remakes and sequels it was really good to see something so refreshing
and original, the best film I have seen since Nolan&#x27;s The Dark Knight.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio is Cobbs, a fugitive who can&#x27;t return to the States
to visit his kids because of an incident that isn&#x27;t explained until
halfway through the film. He specializes in retrieving hidden secrets
from the subconscious of people&#x27;s minds and he does this by invading
their dreams. While he is extracting secrets from Saito (Ken Watanabe),
a millionaire who owns an oil company, something goes wrong and he
fails to get all the information he needed. Saito then convinces Cobbs
to work for him and he promises him that if he does this one job he
will fix his situation in the United States so that he can reunite with
his kids again. This time instead of extracting a secret, Saito wants
Cobbs to plant an idea on someone&#x27;s mind, in other words he wants him
to perform inception. Cobb&#x27;s partner, Arthur (JosephGordon-Levitt),
says that inception is impossible and that it can&#x27;t be done because the
victim will know that the idea never came from him, but Cobbs says that
it&#x27;s possible. In order to perform inception on Saito&#x27;s corporate rival
Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), heir of his deceased father&#x27;s oil
empire, Cobbs needs to assemble a team. First he finds a young
architect named Ariadne (Ellen Page) who is in charge of creating the
world in which the dream takes place in, next he hires Yusuf (Dileep
Rao), a chemist who can create the most powerful sedatives to keep his
subjects asleep, and finally he hires Eames (Tom Hardy), an expert in
impersonating people. Together they have to try to perform the
difficult task of inception, but Cobbs has been having trouble keeping
his personal issues outside of the dream world and his dead wife, Mal
(Marion Cotillard), keeps on invading the dream world and putting the
entire mission in danger.<br /><br />The cast is excellent, but the film really isn&#x27;t character driven, we
are drawn more by the story and the many layers we have to uncover.
Nolan has created a maze and we are the one&#x27;s who have to pay close
attention in order to understand the plot. While Cobb teaches Ariadne
how the dream world works, Nolan is actually using Page&#x27;s character to
explain to us the complexities of this world he created. It is like in
The Matrix where Fishburne&#x27;s character explained everything to Neo.
This is the most original sci-fi film I have seen since The Matrix and
I loved every second of this movie. The two and a half hours fly by and
the ending leaves you wanting to watch the film a second time. In a
time in which Hollywood is running out of fresh ideas, Nolan comes in
to bring a refreshing film. When Cobbs tells Ariadne to &#xA8;never recreate
places from your memory. Always imagine new places!,&#xA8; it is like Nolan
is trying to tell screenwriters to come up with fresh ideas and
recreate new things. The story isn&#x27;t the only refreshing thing about
this film. The visuals are also extraordinary and the action sequences
are breathtaking. It is exciting to see how Ariadne begins creating the
dream world, and the action scene where Arthur fights off the guards in
a gravity free hotel is amazing. This is a movie you must see. The best
of the year and as good as The Dark Knight was.<br /><br />http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/
