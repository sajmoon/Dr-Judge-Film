2010_August 10 
With the good score and knowing Nolans previous work I got into the
movie with some expectation. But the whole thing for me was, wait, the
fun (visual or intellectual) will begin now, but no, it didn&#x27;t begin
then, seemed that some more explanation was needed, so be patient, the
fun will begin soon, that movie looks long.... now?, will it begin
now?... and the movie ended.<br /><br />I was thinking to see it again, perhaps I was not my most brilliant
intellectual day but fortunately I see others experienced something
similar so it was not my fault I think.<br /><br />So, an average+ work but with that hype and the director&#x27;s prestige it
doesn&#x27;t live to the expectations.
