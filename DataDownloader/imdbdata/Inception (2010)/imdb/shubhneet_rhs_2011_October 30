Once again Nolan stays successful in giving us headaches. Trying to
figure out the end, whether Cobb was still dreaming or was he actually
awake. Nonetheless, a superb movie with a unique concept of incepting
the dreams while one is asleep. Building anything we want to is great.
But somehow it reminded me a little bit of Matrix Trilogy. But it is
way above that. A must watch for those who love sci-fi genre.The work
is epic in sweep, beautifully filmed, and strongly acted. I think it
should regularly feature in the all time top 10. Leonardo was great as
Cobb. He did justice to the powerful role of Cobb. As an inceptor, he
was best. A complete thriller, entertainer &#x26; a mind blowing story.
