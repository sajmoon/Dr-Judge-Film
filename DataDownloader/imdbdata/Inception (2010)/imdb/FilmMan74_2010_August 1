First of all Nolan creates a whole new genre of movies with Inception.
It affected me so much that when I slept last night before writing this
review I almost felt like I was slipping into the same worlds and
depths of dreaming as in this movie.<br /><br />Many people have tried to compare this film to &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; But I feel
that is too simple a comparison. It is complex as it is compelling. It
is filled with twists and turns that you don&#x27;t expect coming. It&#x27;s got
great action, suspense and tension.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t think it can easily be described, however I think that is must
be experienced. Of course there are questions on how the technology
works, why these people are able to slip into others dreams. But those
questions are easily forgotten when you get deeper in the story.<br /><br />Go see it. It&#x27;s the best film this year. It&#x27;s original and pulls you in
deeper and deeper and keeps you guessing until the end. Everything and
everyone in this film is beyond great. Just go see it!
