stolen from the anime PAPRIKA ,watch paprika and you&#x27;ll know what i
mean. almost every single detail is stolen from it , you call Nolan a
genius i call him a thief ,he is a genius in the art of stealing the
hall damn thing was a stolen nightmare that am happy that i woke up
from ,or did i? too bad i don&#x27;t have that little stupid thing that
DiCaprio uses to know if he woke up from such a nightmare or not cause
i see its still ranked high in this site (not that this sites rankings
are important any how , i Prefer rotten tomatoes),so that means am
still stuck in this nightmare. enough is said cant afford to waste more
letters reviewing this piece of overrated trash.
