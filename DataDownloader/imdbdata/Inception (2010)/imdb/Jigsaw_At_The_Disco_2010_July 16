I want this to be a very accurate and very constructive review of
Inception, because it seems like people are either overly bashing it or
overrating it out there and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s right. Personally, I
wouldn&#x27;t listen to any critic (not even me) when it comes to Inception
because whether or not you like this movie depends completely on you.
If you&#x27;re looking for deep and complex characters, I don&#x27;t know if
Inception is for you. If you&#x27;re searching for an action film full of
explosions and exciting car chases, I&#x27;m still not sure if Inception is
the right movie for you. But I could be wrong.<br /><br />Inception cannot really be explained in words without giving much away
because of the story&#x27;s complexity but I will tell you this.. Don&#x27;t go
into Inception totally blind. Know that you&#x27;re about to watch a
confusing movie that will make you think. You should also know certain
aspects of the plot. For those aspects, I&#x27;d go to the synopsis located
at the bottom of this review because it is the best description you
will find on the internet. Okay, now that I got that over with, here&#x27;s
what I think about Inception: It is a truly mind blowing experience.
Some scenes in this movie will leave you with your jaw dropped. I can
assure you that some of the stuff that you will see in Inception is
like nothing you&#x27;ve ever seen before. With that being said, it doesn&#x27;t
save Inception from falling short of a fantastic movie. This isn&#x27;t a
mindless action flick, but there is little emotion in some characters.
When it comes to the main character, Cobb, you do have a lot of emotion
and his character does have some depth. But when it comes to other
characters like Ellen Page&#x27;s Ariadne, you&#x27;ll get almost no emotion at
all. Some characters are only present in Inception to provide
exposition or do something to allow the story to move forward. Because
of that, it&#x27;s hard to praise Inception as a masterpiece.<br /><br />I should let you know though, just because the emotion isn&#x27;t really
there, every actor did the best they could with their role in the film.
The other performances are a bit overshadowed by Leonardo DiCaprio&#x27;s,
which was no doubt his best performance to date, but they were still
great. And because I&#x27;m on that subject, I should add that Watanabee and
Hardy have very strong accents in this movie, that are a little hard to
understand at times.<br /><br />Exspeaking of accents, Christopher Nolan&#x27;s directing was top notch.
(Don&#x27;t ask why accents have anything to do with Nolan&#x27;s directing
because I don&#x27;t know either, I just needed a way to get on the
subject.) Nolan has improved drastically since The Dark Knight in terms
of directing action sequences. They are no longer choppy, they flow
very well and are some of the best I&#x27;ve ever seen. (I mean that.) And
Zimmer is there to help out, with an incredible score that I believe is
one of his best. I believe that this is Nolan&#x27;s second best movie in
terms of directing, just behind Memento which was masterfully put
together.<br /><br />To sum everything up, Inception is fantastic when it comes to action
and suspense but falls a bit short with emotion, but it&#x27;s made up for
by great acting and the depth of Cobb&#x27;s character. (which is really the
only character that matters...) However, because of this, Inception is
far from a masterpiece. I&#x27;m going to reward Inception with four stars
(ten on IMDb) because I believe it is the best films of the year so
far, and is one of my personal favorites.<br /><br />Synopsis:
