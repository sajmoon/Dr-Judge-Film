A lot has been written about this film already so I won&#x27;t repeat the
obvious. It is, overall, a very good movie. But it has a big problem.<br /><br />The emotional core of Inception is DiCaprio&#x27;s character and his
&#x22;relationship&#x22; with his wife, Mal. Whenever the movie is telling that
story it&#x27;s fantastic. Whenever it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s not.<br /><br />The end result is a mostly-great movie with about 45 minutes of
unnecessary explosions stapled on.<br /><br />The ultra-generic action sequences (with one notable, Matrix-esquire
exception that ends much too quickly) are tiring and unexciting, and
show a distinct lack of imagination. The Dark Knight demonstrated that
this otherwise-gifted director has trouble building coherent/engaging
action scenes, but the gimmicky nature of the Batman franchise made it
forgivable. In Inception that failing takes center stage since the last
45 minutes demand almost non-stop action that Nolan is frankly unable
to deliver. Placed beside The Matrix, or even this-year&#x27;s Kick-Ass, the
snowy final battle in Inception is downright boring and threatens to
bring the film to an anti-climax. Fortunately the resolution of
DiCaprio&#x27;s storyline is fantastically engaging and brings the rest of
the movie up with it.<br /><br />I wonder if Nolan is wasting his considerable story-telling talents
working in a genre he doesn&#x27;t love. This man does not want to film
action; it&#x27;s obvious. Maybe he should just stop trying and focus on
telling the tales he wants to tell instead.
