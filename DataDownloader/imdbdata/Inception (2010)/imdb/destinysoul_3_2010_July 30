----------Potential Spoiler Alert------------------ Excellent movie. A
cast that has an excellent notion of acting, and that are able to
create a firm attachment to their characters. A developed story that
has the grace to focus more on themes and character development than
burdening itself needlessly with endless plot details. A movie that is
certainly worth watching more than once, and also worth discussing. The
music, though loud seeming in a movie theatre, was intense and
thrilling. The plot is multi-layered and presented in an original way
through the use of acute storytelling as well as top notch
cinematography. The very concept of the movie entices to inner
reflection about the nature of reality; always a good thing. Although
the motivations of the characters seem vague, albeit the fact that they
are working for one of the most powerful men in the world seems
suggestive enough of their motivations, so does the reality in which
the main character evolves leading the viewer to question how real is
real.<br /><br />Thus this movie is recommended by myself, entirely and without
reservation. I give it a nine because no movie is perfect, and I would
have enjoyed further detail on how dreams are constructed and how the
subconscious populates them.
