This movie is a joke. 9.1 rating on IMDb? Better than Dark Knight,
Fight Club, Pulp Fiction, Braveheart? After 10 minutes I just wanted to
get out of the cinema, girls made me stay, and I suffered for 2 hours.
Ridiculous plot. The whole idea is a mess. As soon as I realized, what
this movie was all about, I just wanted to drop it. Chris Nolan, The
Dark Knight is the best ever(due to Heath Ledger), but this one? It is
beautifully executed, excellently done. It would be a masterpiece film,
but this plot, this nonsense! Nonsense is the best way to describe
this. There are movies, which are complicated, and I love&#x27;em. But to
over-complicate a nonsense? Watch South Park&#x27;s new
episode(Insheeption)! That one tells you exactly, what this movie is
like. Do not compare it with Matrix. That one is credible, possible,
you can find logic in it, but not in Inception. I do not remember the
last time, I wanted out of a cinema after 10 minutes! I would not
recommend this movie to anyone! Nevertheless, Long live Chris Nolan!
