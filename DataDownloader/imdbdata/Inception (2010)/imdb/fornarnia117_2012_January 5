This movie left me speechless. That&#x27;s why it took me two years to write
a review on it. I&#x27;m twelve years old and before inception I knew I
would be in the film industry. After I saw inception, it inspired me so
much that since the first time I saw it, I&#x27;ve written and directed two
30 minute films, and written over 50 stories and screenplays. The
reason inception is so good, is that it makes you think. If you get up
to go to the bathroom, or to get something to drink, the rest of the
movie won&#x27;t make sense at all whatsoever. The writer and director of
inception, Christopher Nolan, is the Einstein of film. From what I
heard is that he had the idea of inception for over 10 years. Besides
the storyline, this film is a joy to look at. The camera angles match
perfectly with the mood of the scene. I also appreciate that
Christopher Nolan didn&#x27;t use a lot of CGI in this film. In summary,
Inception is my favorite film of all time. The ending might make sense,
as long as you don&#x27;t go to the restroom in the middle of the movie.
