Inception is probably the best scifi since The Matrix. Maybe even
better. There, I said it. The imagination and idea behind Inception are
wonderful, and it was certainly executed near-flawlessly. However, it
is a bit complex, especially with tons of different things going on at
once. Personally, I didn&#x27;t mind much, but it does get confusing. And
there&#x27;s an almost complete lack of an emotional plot. But that&#x27;s what
happens when scifi goes mainstream. People and critics used to
brilliant conventional movies notice the plot holes, crave for the
missing details, and sometimes find it all overwhelming.<br /><br />While the hype is too much, Inception is the first movie I&#x27;ve seen in
the theater that I recommended to everyone I knew. Avatar was fun, but
it was easy to forget once I saw it twice. Inception was different,
exciting, and just plain brilliant. But it&#x27;s not changing movies with
breakthrough VFX or new ideas (at least I hope people won&#x27;t try to copy
it), and it&#x27;s not the best movie ever (Dr. Strangelove keeps that title
in my book), but it did restore my hope that there are some great ideas
ready to be made into a movie, whether Leo DiCaprio planted them or
not.
