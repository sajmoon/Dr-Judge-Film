2011_February 2 
Not far into this film I thought it wasn&#x27;t for me but my husband will
like it. But after enduring more than half of it I realised that was an
insult to his intelligence.<br /><br />Utterly boring and confused (rather than confusing) with pointless
violence just for the sake of it. Will no doubt make a decent computer
game.<br /><br />I am giving this 3 purely for the special effects, which are OK.<br /><br />If I never I see another film like this it will be too soon.<br /><br />I have never reviewed a movie on here before but I felt I must as that
9.2 rating has to change!
