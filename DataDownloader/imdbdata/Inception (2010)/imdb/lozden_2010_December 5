A complex,action-packed,brain wrenching story with twists and turns
that call for full attention on the side of the viewer...a
film-noir,that reminds one of Matrix.<br /><br />Inception is also an eloquent and original way of showing how our
subconscious is projected in our seemingly meaningless dreams...it
wouldn&#x27;t appear as surreal as it seems if one looks at the plot from
that angle. <br /><br />However,this movie shouldn&#x27;t either be overrated as the best film of
the decade or underrated as the worst!Either would do little justice to
Nolan&#x27;s latest film. <br /><br />I must add that definitely Memento is the better movie!
