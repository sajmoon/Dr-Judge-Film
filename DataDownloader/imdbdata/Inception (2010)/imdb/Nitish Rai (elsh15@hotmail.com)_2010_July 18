My new role model Chris Nolan..How do you make a movie like that.<br /><br />The only 2 reasons I went to watch this movie are IMDb rating and
Christopher Nolan. It has been like never that I felt a movie as
striking as this one.<br /><br />The connection between reality and dreams is so beautifully presented
that it makes you at one point or the other ask yourself whether you
are living in the reality yourself.<br /><br />It gives you an imagination which you could possibly use while dying;
that maybe you are entering a new world.<br /><br />Now I read most of IMDb reviews before going for the movie which said
stuff like, it had Bollywood style shots..story was cr*p and all.<br /><br />Well they were true but while watching the movie, the Visual effects
and the whole script makes it look real. This is not at all a
disappointment but fact it leaves a numbing effect on you.<br /><br />If you&#x27;ve got any imagination then this movie might be the one that u
waited for since childhood.
