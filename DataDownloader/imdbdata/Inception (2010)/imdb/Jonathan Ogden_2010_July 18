This film really blew me away. From start to finish I was completely
immersed in the world of Inception and it never let go until the end.
In fact, is hasn&#x27;t let me go since. Nolan did an amazing job of writing
and directing this film and although it was clearly a fictional film,
it felt believable. The way the dream scenes were constructed is
amazing: there were no blurry scenes, fuzzy edges, people talking in
strange voices, unusual lenses or camera shots. Everything in the dream
world felt real, but felt like a dream. The actors did a great job in
creating characters that you really get to know and care about.<br /><br />All in all, this film is masterfully crafted and is a must see. I might
still be under it&#x27;s spell but it feels like one of my favourite all
time movies at the moment. Inception has all the playfulness,
creativity and craziness of an independent passion project, with the
budget and effects of a blockbuster. See it.
