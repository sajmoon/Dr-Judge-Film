The most incredible movie i have seen to date, perfectly balanced
action and drama. Unbelievable and hard to grasp but easy to
understand. Perfect in length and so clever in every aspect. <br /><br />Inception is one of those movies that makes you think and leaves you
thinking for hours after you have left the cinema and anyone who has
not seen this movie must see it and i recommend actually going to the
cinema and not waiting for DVD or pirate as this movie is worth every
penny.<br /><br />Believe me you don&#x27;t want to be the one person who missed inception !
Quite simply the movie of the decade and a must see for anyone !
