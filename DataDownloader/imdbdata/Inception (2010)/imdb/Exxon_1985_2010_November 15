2010_November 15 
the year 2010 was really pissing me off with a whole bunch of scum
movies that were supposed to be memorials but were for the birds for
god sakes.now after 9 months of expect ion,finally i got the summer
blockbuster phenomenon really late at November which is my bad for i
did not get its DVD nor Blu-Ray for specific.<br /><br />now i should say that when you have such peerless idea for a movie,the
right stuff are to be gathered and the raw material are to be shaped.in
this case for Inception,90% is totally done in sublime.but the distress
of subject is really harsh and hard to be performed.<br /><br />i do not intended to spoil it anyway but when making success out of
some Batman movie,you cant drop your feet and preserve yourself from
dictate your idealism onto one construction which is highly supplied
and plentifully a multi million budget expected movie.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan must&#x27;ve considered himself as an exotic and gifted
director in which he is for sure.but he must which his steps of
slippery either.the movie really turned me on about him.he is inside of
dreams of his hand made characters.he must not lose himself in
complicated ideas at the times of prosperity for the times they are a
changing.<br /><br />but over head of all the issues,the movie is a wreck outstanding jar of
ones sick nigh mares.and i see lots of progress in most of the cast and
the watching is highly recommended.i feel that aside of high budget
state,the thoughts of writer/director is some sorts of performed and
the rate of prodigality is high at the same time.<br /><br />the circle of cast is been influenced by Nolan&#x27;s rigor but the
resistance of some is so very apparent.Ellen Page is some lousy kid
wiggling like horsefly in everywhere.Marion Cotillard was some moaning
sloth with least avail point in my view.it is so bad for her after
winning an Oscar that French doll,Leonardo DiCaprio is pushing hard now
in which is respectable,but all the same moves are to be occurred more
or less.well done about him but he has ro struggle harder to be
something considerable.Ken Watanabe is OK and the rest i don&#x27;t give a
crap about.<br /><br />the movie shows of Nolan&#x27;s maturity after 12 years of career.but,he
must watch his steps from now on,chances like Inception are really few
in counting.you use it or loose it and Nolan has...
