Well, after all the hype, I had to see this film. DeCaprio is much more
mature, and I enjoyed that. Also seeing Cotaillard was lovely.<br /><br />Although I enjoy complicated plots, I kept thinking &#x22;for heavens sake,
is this the Matrix?&#x22;. And also expected something akin to a Terminator
remark. Something like &#x22;I imagined this with you and came back in time
to save you&#x22;, or something like that.<br /><br />Many of the actors did excellent jobs. And my, how Shia Labeof has
grown! And Ciaran Murphy was, as always, excellent.<br /><br />Tim Nolan did a very fine job, but I agree with some of the other
comments: are the people really in real time, or are they still living
out a thought planted by the Inceptor.<br /><br />The man I saw it with thought it was just so-so. The special effects
were great, but at the end of the movie, I was simply glad it was over.
