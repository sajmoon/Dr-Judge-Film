Please forgive me if I have missed the point here, in essence I liked
the movie...I like being reminded of alternative realities...I think it
helps keep that thought fresh in our minds...to keep questioning the
reality we are experiencing..but please help me to understand if I have
gotten this wrong.... The whole point ( driving emotional motivation)is
for dear Dom to be able to be with his kids again....but after the part
about his guilt and manipulating Mal (eventually driven to commit
suicide!)was revealed, I lost all sympathy for him and didn&#x27;t want to
see him anywhere near small children...so that kind of ruined the point
of the movie for me...although cool to watch and contemplate...<br /><br />Also...again forgive me if I did not understand...but what&#x27;s up with
two rival businessmen sitting across the plane aisle from one another
and no recognition?<br /><br />Thanks for your help!
