You may not understand entirely what is going on in INCEPTION,
especially on the first go- around, haha, but you will be blown away by
the special effects &#x26; edge-of-your-seat, super spy plot. This movie was
visually stunning and had an excellent Golden Globe nominated music
score. Casting was perfect -- not too many big-named stars stepping on
each other&#x27;s toes (like in Oceans 11, for example. That&#x27;s
distracting.). This had a good mix of actors who worked together in a
believable way on-screen. Inception may be too long, at least 30-45
minutes could be cut, but overall it was a great, original action flick
-- action, romance, danger, spys &#x26; blowing sh*t up! Nice!
