there&#x27;s only a limit to the times of perfection multiplied but
Christopher Nolan shows us that we&#x27;re wrong by proving the impossible,
possible, in movie and reality. The complexity, the endless
permutations of the most complex thing ever the human mind have never
been so passionately, intelligently, philosophically and gracefully
handled by anyone else. The real thing about the movie is its reference
to the ever twisting bond between reality and thought. So powerful is
one&#x27;s subconscious that it can create, destroy entire universes. The
logic of time slowing down with every layer is one of the most striking
stroke of genius that I&#x27;ve ever seen. 1/2 mark deducted cause Ariadne
and Arthur (romantically) weren&#x27;t carried further, another half cause
you can&#x27;t rate it 9.5 here. Any ways to all the critics of this movie
just one thing delve a bit deeper into your mind before trying to
understand this one.<br /><br />Inception is a biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiig must watch
