plz forgive me if there is mistakes in my English.<br /><br />i always watch any US movie comes out , may be i saw more than a 5000
movie , my all time favorite was empire of the sun by Stephen Spielberg
but i guess now is the time for some change as this movie is beyond for
being an all time favorite movie , i just can&#x27;t believe any human being
can simply create such a story , all my respect goes to the writer and
the director , the plot and the directory will makes you don&#x27;t see any
goofs in this movie or even ignore if you found one , unfortunately you
need to have a very high IQ to understand 70% of it , this movie will
be useless below age 15 , the end is an amazing end that makes you
don&#x27;t wanna go home , i guess the success of this movie is because it
tells about things happens to any human and tells things i bet any
human already thought about it , the dreams are always a mystery i
think this is the first movie that took this topic an gave it to the
audience better than any other , damn i love this movie , i guess only
idiot people rated this movie below 9 as they didn&#x27;t get it well ,
enjoy this movie to the max cause u won&#x27;t see this plot or directory
again for a very long time thanks and please rate me good loool ;)
