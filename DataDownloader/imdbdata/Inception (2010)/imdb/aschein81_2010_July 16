Well, it&#x27;s summer movie season my friends, so that means it&#x27;s time for
lots of stupid movies aimed at young kids and teens who are off of
school for summer break. Yep, lots of pointless, predictable stories
involving lots of unnecessary CGI, animated people, fart jokes, and
vampires. However, once in a while we get a great indie filmmaker like
Christopher Nolan who doesn&#x27;t care about trying to make a movie
&#x22;popular&#x22; but rather focuses on trying to take his audience on an
adventure where we experience thrills we aren&#x27;t used to experiencing at
the movies. Like his other films, Inception relies on stellar
performances from its cast, as well as storytelling twists that
constantly keep us guessing. However, I think this film surpasses his
other films in that in addition to clever storytelling he adds some
incredibly imaginative visuals and choreographed action sequences that
blow your mind as well as almost knock you out of your seat.<br /><br />One of the challenges of reviewing a science-fiction film like this is
that it plays around with time and space. So therefore, it doesn&#x27;t play
by the usual rules of plot and story, since the world it exists in is
the subconscious. Therefore, as an audience member you are going to be
somewhat frustrated trying to figure out what this movie is &#x22;about.&#x22; At
the theater I was at today, a few women near me walked out about an
hour and a half into the film and never returned, probably because they
simply refused to allow the film to take them on this journey into the
unknown. I am certain that many, many moviegoers will hate this movie
for that reason, since it doesn&#x27;t have a cut and paste formulaic
narrative that they are used to seeing in films. This is basically a
low budget art film at its core and soul, with 150 million dollars of
production design and special effects sprinkled on top and around the
edges. If you go in expecting a simple Hollywood Shoot Em Up script
with good guys and bad guys you will be sorely disappointed. This is
basically &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; meets &#x22;What Dreams May Come&#x22; meets &#x22;Ocean&#x27;s
Eleven&#x22; on steroids.<br /><br />It would be hard for anyone to spoil the film for you, since if you
have heard of it you already know that it is about a group of thieves
who have the ability to steal someone&#x27;s dreams, and the complex
consequences that could result by trying to do this. After watching the
film, that&#x27;s pretty much all you understand by the end of it anyways,
so you just have to watch the film to experience it for yourself. You
will either love it or hate it, depending on what level of creativity
and imagination you like to see in films. I say to just allow yourself
to appreciate this artistic vision and be taken into this world by the
exceptional acting, outstanding storytelling, exciting action, and
imaginative visuals. The visuals are actually enough to give this film
a fairly high rating on their own. One that especially amazed me was a
fight involving Joseph-Gordon Levitt inside a zero-gravity hallway.
It&#x27;s just amazing because it doesn&#x27;t look like any special effects were
used whatsoever. It simply looks like the real actors are floating and
fighting in this hallway and climbing up and down walls! I am certain
wires were used in some clever way; I just have no idea how. There is
also a scene where a locomotive steamrolls down a city street crashing
into cars (without any tracks under it), and just like in The Dark
Knight truck chase where Nolan actually flipped the Joker&#x27;s truck for
real, you can tell that this stunt was also filmed for real. <br /><br />Last but not least, it is important to note that lost in all this is
the fact that DiCaprio gives an incredible performance in this film.
Yes, his name is on the top of the movie poster but he is not the star
of this. The star of this film is Nolan and his vision, and DiCaprio
does a great job of restraining himself from over-doing it so that
Nolan can succeed in creating his vision. It would not surprise me to
see him get a Best Actor nomination. I also foresee Marion Cotillard
getting a Best Supporting Actress nomination. I was mesmerized and
spellbound every time she showed up on screen, even though she has a
fairly small role overall. She&#x27;s essentially playing a ghost, but the
most beautiful, sexiest, tormented, and scariest ghost a female could
ever play. Nolan will also definitely get a Best Director and Best
Picture nomination at the Oscars, you can bet on those.<br /><br />CAUTION: Side effects that may result from watching this film may
include brain hemorrhages as well as necessary check ups at the
psychiatric ward at your local hospital. = )
