I have to say, I could&#x27;ve been easily disappointed by Inception. Dream
travel being one of my favourite subjects, I wouldn&#x27;t have expected a
failure. But then again, Christopher Nolan cannon produce a failure.<br /><br />Aided by an excellent team - Leonardo DiCaprio, renowned for other
psychological pieces like The Aviator or the more recent Shutter
Island, Marion Cotillard, a surprising Ellen Page in a role far more
complex than Juno, and Nolan&#x27;s Batman series stars Cilian Murphy and
Michael Caine - the director makes a plunge deep into the human mind,
touching one of the most impressive parts - dreams.<br /><br />I was impressed by the lack of usual sci-fi &#x22;helpers&#x22;: colourful
lights, portals and fantastic creatures, inappropriate for this title.
As with The Dark Knight, Nolan has kept the surreal as realistic as
possible, thus not steering away from the plot.<br /><br />In all honesty, after watching Inception, it was so good I thought I
was dreaming.
