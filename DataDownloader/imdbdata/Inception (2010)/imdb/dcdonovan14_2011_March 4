Beyond boring, had to turn it off. The story line is retarded, it is
very confusing. The only reason I would even give it one star is
because Leonardo and the girl from Juno are good. The special effects
were overdone and so unrealistic it made it even more boring. The whole
concept of this movie is so unrealistic I can&#x27;t even take it.
&#x22;projections of my subconscious?&#x22;. Dreams within dreams within dreams
within dreams I am bored to tears watching this movie. Dreams come
alive and then dreams and subconscious and dreams you just can&#x27;t
control, I guess I am into realistic movies. This movie is crap and I
would seriously suggest sticking needles in your eyes before I watched
this, that would be seriously more entertaining.
