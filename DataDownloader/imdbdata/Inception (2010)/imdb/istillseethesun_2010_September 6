THIS MOVIE IS INCREDIBLE. Oh my goodness. I heard all my friends
talking about it, so as soon as I got the chance, I went and saw it. I
was obviously not disappointed.<br /><br />It has such a weird plot, weird in a good way. It&#x27;s interesting,
original, genius. The whole time I was thinking, &#x22;Wow, what mastermind
conceived this??&#x22; And when I saw it was Christopher Nolan, he moved up
a lot on my list of favorite directors. What a smart guy. Anyway, the
plot is so complex I don&#x27;t even think I can give a one sentence
summary. There were some points in the movie where I had no idea what
was happening, but I attribute that to my sleep deprivation. You need
to be pretty alert to catch this movie, you need to be smart. I was
sitting in front of some people who did not fit this criteria and they
were asking questions the whole time. Don&#x27;t be like that. Don&#x27;t be
those people.<br /><br />This is a movie where the beginning puzzles you completely. You have no
idea who anyone is, what they&#x27;re doing, why they&#x27;re doing it, and then
as the movie progresses, things just click in your head. I love that
feeling, that &#x27;ohhhhhhhhhhh!&#x27; feeling. It&#x27;s satisfying.<br /><br />It was visually stunning, one of the most beautiful movies I have ever
seen. There&#x27;s a large portion of the movie where the characters are in
a place with no gravity, and it was awe-inspiring. It is definitely one
of my favorite scenes of all time. The effects that were done
digitally, the CGI, were great. I usually can&#x27;t stand them because they
look so obviously fake, but that&#x27;s not how this movie was. The CGI was
actually very beautiful. This movie also had slow motion, which I love.
Not overdone, perfect.<br /><br />The characters were great. There was nobody I hated or wished would
die. Leonarda DiCaprio was excellent, as he was in Shutter Island. When
I saw Ellen Page in the commercials, I thought that was peculiar
casting, but I actually enjoyed her character and how she portrayed
her. The cast was excellent.<br /><br />Definitely, definitely, see this movie! Probably twice. You will not be
disappointed. Buy it when you get the chance! Heads up, the ending will
make you stop breathing, will make you clench your fists so tight that
you have indentations in your flesh from your fingernails. Interpret it
your own way. That&#x27;s really all you can do.
