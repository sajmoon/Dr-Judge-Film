Okay, so when I dream, anything can happen. I have had dreams within
dreams, and there was no special time ratio. Everything is so
contrived, when, as others have mentioned, the director could have done
just about anything he wanted since it is a dream. I&#x27;m not sure how
people can dream together and have any kind of dream harmony, or effect
any outcome on others. None of it makes any sense, and it&#x27;s just a
skeleton on which to hang crappy computer generated images; those beach
scenes are especially cartoon-ish and pathetic. I love Leo DiCaprio and
Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and that the two of them together couldn&#x27;t redeem
this pseudo intellectual turd of a movie just shows how bad it really
is.
