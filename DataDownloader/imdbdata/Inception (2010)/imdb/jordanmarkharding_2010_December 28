Ever since i started loving movies, i have been searching for my
favorite and for a long time it was the good the bad and the ugly but
this beat it 10 fold. When i started to get into it, i realised just
how brilliantly put the together it was and how amazing the story line
was. It was written by someone who has a broad spectrum for a mind and
someone who does not just see the world for what it is but also sees it
for its potential is. The film was the only one i have ever watched
that had me on the edge of my seat for the entire film. The cliffhanger
at the end was brilliant and i actually screamed when it left it open
for discussion. Thanks for the great film and i hope it will remain the
best film i have ever seen.
