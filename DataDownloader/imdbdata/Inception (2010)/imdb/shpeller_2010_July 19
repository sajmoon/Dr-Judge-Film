2010_July 19 
I read the hype, and came expecting to be challenged, excited and
entertained. Well...the special effects were good...Ellen Page and Ken
Watanabe were quite good...but story was atrocious! I like complicated
movies, but this was ridiculous...too much effort on trying to keep us
on the edge of our seats, and minimal success keeping us interested in
any of the main characters (Ellen Page was interesting, but the others
held no interest for me). I couldn&#x27;t wait for it to end. There was
absolutely no buy in to Cobb, or what happens to him. 2 1/2 hours was
waaay too long. The story line between Cobb and his wife was laughable.
It&#x27;s not often I come out of movie feeling angry and really ripped off.
But this movie is just a huge waste of time. Stay Away.
