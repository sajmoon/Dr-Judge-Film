Dom Cobb (Leo DiCaprio) and his assembled team enter the minds of
people to steal their deepest secrets. This time, his &#x22;last&#x22; time, He
is asked not to steal anything, but plant an idea, something which some
people say is impossible to achieve.<br /><br />Wow. I very rarely come out of the cinema speechless, but this was
truly mesmerising. The plot has many twists, turns and layers, but is
not overly confusing. It&#x27;s confusing enough to make you want to see it
again, and have discussions with friends afterwards, but not so much
that it would alienate you - the perfect balance.<br /><br />Nolan has created his piece de resistance. All of the cast put in
exceptional performances - especially DiCaprio, who I used to be a huge
critic of.<br /><br />The score by Hans Zimmer creates a constant &#x22;edge of your seat&#x22; tension
as to what is going to happen next. Even for his standards, a musical
masterpiece.<br /><br />The cinematography - just unbelievable. I constantly was mesmerised,
amazed, confused and delighted all at the same time! There have been a
few films to tackle the &#x22;dream versus reality&#x22; theme in recent years.
The Matrix films come to mind, and there are some comparisons. But this
is a very different film, and maybe unfair to compare. Vanilla Sky was
another, and this just walks all over that for an idea and a completed
work.<br /><br />A work of art (without being pretentious - it really is!) Go and see it
at all costs, as many times as you can afford.
