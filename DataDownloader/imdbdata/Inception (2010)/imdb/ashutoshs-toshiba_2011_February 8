when i heard that it s difficult to understand this movie and saw a 9.2
rating in the IMDb i was too curious about the movie.when i saw the
movie i just told to my mind HATS OFF TO CHRISTOPHER NOLAN!!! THIS
MOVIE WAS SO AMAZING THAT I WAS NOT BORED FOR JUST A SEC. every one in
the world must watch inception. i had seen Nolan&#x27;s earlier movie(dark
knight bat man begins,the prestige etc)and had high expectations but
the movie crossed it all.i am now waiting for his new movie the dark
knight rises. i am sure it would cross my expectations<br /><br />the movie is about a skilled thief Dom Cobb who enters the subconscious
minds of his target with 2 levels dream within a dream Cobb is
approached by wealthy Mr Saito who asks to perform the act of
inception.then starts the real movie confusions,twists,turns and action
in the movie i wont tell you the story &#x27;cause go watch it
