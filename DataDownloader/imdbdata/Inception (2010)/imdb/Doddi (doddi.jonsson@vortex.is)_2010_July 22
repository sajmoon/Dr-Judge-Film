As a film enthusiast I love seeing new things, confusing but sensible
plots, along with great acting and directing. I have always been a fan
of film music, and I also believe that most of today&#x27;s &#x22;Hollywood
films&#x22; are more &#x22;lovely package but not so much on the ingredients&#x22;.<br /><br />I have heard: &#x22;Cinema is dead, there is nothing new!&#x22; And looking at
the remakes of films like Fame, Nightmare on Elm Street and more... I
cannot completely disagree. But then comes a true gem like Nolan&#x27;s
Inception, and I smile and shout: YES!!!! This is what cinema is all
about! Mindblowing experience, great script, great acting, great art
direction, costumes and fantastic music, but most importantly: a
director capable of having all this totally under control and doing
such a great job. Christohper Nolan: I salute you for this masterpiece
- because that is what Inception is: a masterpiece. Best film I&#x27;ve seen
in ... such a long time.<br /><br />The idea itself: being inside someone&#x27;s dream/thoughts and stealing
information/planting something... is simply amazing. But I was a bit
skeptic about this being put on screen - how do you visualize this and
hand it to the audience on a believable plate? Well, the answer is
Chris Nolan. Without a doubt, he&#x27;s now among my favorite directors. A
guy who directs Memento, Insomnia, The Prestige and The Dark Knight
outdoes himself with Inception... you rank there deservedly Mr. Nolan:
in the top! I&#x27;ve always believed in DiCaprio and his acting abilities,
partly underestimated actor but greatly revived by Scorsese and now
Nolan makes the best of his abilities. An actor like Gordon-Levitt
amazed me with his super cool wit and action and acting, Tom Hardy was
fabulous, Page and Murphy both great... Watanebe fantastic. One of this
year&#x27;s greatest casting, if not the best.<br /><br />Hans Zimmer is among my favorite composers... his score is amazing.<br /><br />Everything really is &#x22;10 out of 10&#x22; in this film. If you like great
acting, see Inception. If you like great direction and writing, see
Inception. If you wanna see something new, see Inception. Never mind
these &#x22;Ifs&#x22;... just see this movie. It&#x27;s impossible not to love :)
