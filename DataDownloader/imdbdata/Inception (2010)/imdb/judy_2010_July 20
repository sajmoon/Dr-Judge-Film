2010_July 20 
Like everyone else I was expecting a lot from Inception. I was a great
fan of Dark City and the Matrix and felt that this movie would have the
same flavor. In some ways it did and in some it didn&#x27;t. The beginning
is fast paced and sets up the characters well. You care some about Cobb
but I just couldn&#x27;t start feeling that this was just a rehash of
DiCarpio&#x27;s &#x27;Shutter Island&#x27; as far as the plot was concerned. All of
the acting is first rate but the story just doesn&#x27;t engage you and you
really don&#x27;t care what is dream and what is reality in the end. And the
middle of this movie is so slow that both my husband and I fell asleep,
now that&#x27;s shameful for a film that suppose to be intelligent and get
into your mind. Again Hollywood has not lack of special effects but
they are devoid of story once again. I think that Pixar seems to be the
only ones who really look closely at the story before they do all the
extras.
