Christopher Jonathan James Nolan has made some brilliant movies in his
not so long directorial life! Inception is just an addition to his
quiver of mind blowing films. It is so good to watch a film like
Inception which strives and manages to dream big without giving up on
the cerebral portion of film making.<br /><br />Inception has a plot that is best left unexplained and untainted but I
do have to admit, it is one of Chris Nolan&#x27;s most non complicated
movies. I still think his best was in Following and Memento! This film
is brilliant but somehow you have a feeling that he is holding back not
pulling all punches. It seems almost tailored for the Iron Man and
Transformers audience. I can understand it not being too vague but I do
feel that Inception has been over simplified thus losing a bit of its
shine in the process. But trust me it is still going to be the most
engrossing big movie of the year and it is an awesome watch. Its just
that it does not challenge the viewer as much as some of Nolan&#x27;s
previous movies did and that is something I missed during watching this
film. But then i guess its understandable with a budget of $160 mil.<br /><br />On the acting front brilliant performances from everyone and its a
delight to see Michael Kane in a two bit role. Leo DiCaprio reprises a
role similar to his role in the recent Shutter Island and is just as
good. Marion Cotillard is shimmering and sensuous as Leo&#x27;s wife.<br /><br />Overall a great intriguing movie to watch but still does not overwhelm
Nolan&#x27;s best films which continue to be his initial movies!
