This movie hit on every level: script, cinematography, visual effects,
acting, directing, editing, music score. I could go on and on ad
nauseam but I would argue that this is a far more deserving title for
kudos than a film like Avatar.<br /><br />First, it solidified Christopher Nolan into the thread of Hollywood
immortality and separated him from the Batman re-envisioned franchise.
He took his skilled filmmaking, displayed with such distinct genius in
Memento and commercialized it without losing credibility as a
filmmaker. <br /><br />Secondly, it reinstated Leonardo DiCaprio as king of Hollywood. Let&#x27;s
not forget, Titanic was Leo&#x27;s greatest financial achievement as an
actor. Since starring in that film, he has chosen to work with almost
no one but Martin Scorsese in his utter demand to be taken seriously as
an actor. It has worked very well as he has moved away from heartthrob
status and into character actor longevity and credibility. BUT, none of
these films have been very successful at the box office. Inception, has
changed this trend, but not in sacrifice of character and depth.<br /><br />Thirdly, it has finally brought to attention the deserving appreciation
of Joseph Gordon-Levitt . There&#x27;s not much else to say in that respect. <br /><br />A masterpiece, perfect film.
