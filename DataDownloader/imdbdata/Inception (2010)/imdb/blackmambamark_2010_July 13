Only a small handful of directors have the ability to make an audience
wait on pins and needles for their next NON sequel release. For me, i
cannot remember the last time i was this excited for a movie i know
virtually nothing about. Now i know i may be speaking on my own here,
but director Christopher Nolan very well may be the best director of
our generation. Because the guy has not missed so far. &#x22;Memento&#x22;, &#x22;The
Prestige&#x22;, The Batman Series......the guy is a loose cannon who fires
nothing but cinematic gold. As time goes on, he only seems to get
better and better. Hopefully he can continue the re-occurring trend.<br /><br />Okay, let me get this off my chest, because it feels like an alien
ready to burst out of my chest........this is easily one of the 10 best
movies i have ever seen in my entire life. And that is not because i
built this up in my mind or bought into the hype generated around this
film, because everything i thought this movie was going to be, fell
short of what it actually was about 20 minutes into it. This movie is
cinematic genius at it&#x27;s best, plain and simple. We have been due for a
movie like this for a loooonnngggg time. And i don&#x27;t mean this year, or
the recent string of poor movies that have been released......i mean we
are due for a movie that actually changes the way we look at movies.
Now i know one would be quick to say &#x22;Well wait a minute, Avatar
already did that.&#x22;. But that is where you would be wrong. James Cameron
gave us a feast with &#x22;Avatar&#x22;. This movie cooks you an entire
Thanksgiving dinner.<br /><br />I could honestly sit here and try as hard as i could to try and
describe the movie to you, and it wouldn&#x27;t make a lick of sense because
the movie is beyond in-depth. Case in point.....you remember the first
time you saw the first &#x22;Matrix&#x22;, and how complex and deep the plot was.
Well, in words, this movie makes that idea look like &#x22;Kindergarden
Cop&#x22;. No disrespect to &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; at all, but this movie is probably
the most in-depth, detailed, complex, and entertaining movie ever
created by man.<br /><br />And that&#x27;s all Nolan seems to do. He creates these scripts that almost
take a life of their own. You get a glimpse of it in &#x22;Memento&#x22;, and you
certainly see it in action with &#x22;The Prestige&#x22;......how the actual plot
outline and story, is the actual trick. In this movie, it deals with
mazes, and in turn, the whole movie is like a giant maze that you try
and figure out.<br /><br />But that&#x27;s where Nolan&#x27;s true genius comes in. Through out the entire
picture, he gives you these little clues as to whats going on, like a
puzzle, and he shows you how they all get put together, rather than
putting it together for you. He leaves it up to the audience to do so.
And that&#x27;s what makes this movie great, because he challenges the
audience like no other movie i have ever seen.<br /><br />And speaking of things i have never seen. In order for a movie written
this well to work, it must be shot in the same fashion. And Nolan, once
again, out does himself. If you are a fan of cinematography, as i am as
well, then this movie, literally, is your wet dream. Talking about
these elaborate dream sequences is one thing, but seeing them in action
is beyond anything you have ever seen on the silver screen. Throughout
the entire film, i kept taking a napkin to my face to wipe the clumps
of drool that were collecting at the bottom of my jaw.<br /><br />Bottom Line, this is a movie i could write a novel about, and it
certainly deserves that attention. To pretty much sum it up, if you
want to see the movie that is going to win best picture of the year, go
and see this movie. If you want to see one of the best movies in the
past 10 years, go and see this movie. If you want to see a movie that
will pretty much change your method of thinking, then go and see this
movie. God only knows how many movies i have seen in my lifetime, but i
can say with complete just, that this is certainly one of the 10 best i
have EVER seen.
