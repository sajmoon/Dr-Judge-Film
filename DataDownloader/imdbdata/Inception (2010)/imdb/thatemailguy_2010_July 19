Wow, I&#x27;ve read some of the negative reviews and all I can say is that I
feel bad for some of you. I feel bad for people that can&#x27;t &#x22;let go&#x22; and
have to have an explanation... for EVERYTHING!!! Can&#x27;t you ever just
block that out and enjoy a little fantasy? Also, if you break down just
about any movie, you can find elements from previous movies... I mean
seriously, it&#x27;s been a while since anyone has come ups with something
100% original.<br /><br />I also don&#x27;t believe that this was one of the greatest films of all
time either, but it was very enjoyable.<br /><br />I would recommend seeing it but don&#x27;t expect any sort of life-changing
event!
