Inception is one of those movies that will be remembered years from now
for being the first of its kind.<br /><br />For me, this movie had everything - an interesting plot, action,
mindfu*k, twists - and all of that was &#x27;coated&#x27; with a nice layer of
surrealistic aura. If you can call it that.<br /><br />Just as every good work of fiction, Inception makes you think - be it
the overlapping realms, and the effects actions in one realm have in
the other (plot, logic); or the character dramas, such as, &#x27;Is it worth
holding on to memories of the past if they keep haunting and holding me
back?&#x27;, &#x27;Can I be trusted?&#x27;, &#x27;When everything seems desperate, keep on
fighting&#x27;, etc. - the movie is filled with ideas to discover
(philosophy).
