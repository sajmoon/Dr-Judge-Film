Think back to your early youth. The most exciting trip was to the local
amusement park. The candy, the people in costumes and of course the
rides. But we learned quickly that the best rides required an &#x22;E&#x22;
ticket and of course, there were never enough &#x22;E&#x22; tickets for the day.<br /><br />As adults we look to more intellectual pursuits. We read books, travel
to distant lands, and on occasion we endeavor to find something new and
exciting at the movies. But more often than not, we find that films
from Hollywood utterly disappoint us with plots that have been rehashed
from hundreds of other films or insult us with vulgar comedies that are
churned out on a regular basis.<br /><br />&#x22;Inception,&#x22; a new film from Christopher Nolan, the director of &#x22;The
Dark Knight,&#x22; is one rare instance when Hollywood has gotten it right.
The film has a tightly woven script (also penned by Nolan) that allows
the viewer to enter a world of espionage with a clever twist.
&#x22;Inception,&#x22; has been advertised as a film similar to &#x22;The Matrix,&#x22; and
here to set the record straight: it is not. It is a much better movie
than any of the Matrix films, which tend to be too convoluted for any
true enjoyment. &#x22;Inception,&#x22; remains unique without reaching too far
beyond the boundary of imagination.<br /><br />Starring Leonardo DiCaprio and &#x22;Juno&#x27;s&#x22; Ellen Page, the film depicts a
world in which even your deepest secrets are not save. The new criminal
of this world enters into your mind during dream-state in order to
steal from you or even implant an idea that could change the world. But
how safe is this new form of theft? DiCaprio&#x27;s character finds that his
new world of dreams and reality often are difficult to tell apart. And
that like all new technology, a simpler way of life much be abandoned
to fully embrace the new one.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan&#x27;s job as director and writer are spot on. His world
of reality intermixed with dreams have stunning visual effects that
even out weigh those in &#x22;The Dark Knight.&#x22; Out of the supporting cast,
most impressive are Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ken Watanabe. The only
disappointing part of the film is the bad casting of Marion Cotillard
and the annoying insertion of the song &#x22;La vie en rose.&#x22;<br /><br />Overall,&#x22;Inception,&#x22; is the best film of the year so far. Being
released among the summer it would be shameful if it is not remember
for award season. So at last film lovers, it&#x27;s time to rejoice! It
appears that there may still be one more &#x22;E&#x22; ticket left in our book.<br /><br />For more film review by Kay Shackleton, copy and click this string onto
