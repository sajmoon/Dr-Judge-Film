One of the few movies I have purchased without watching and at the end
I was definitely satisfied with my purchase.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan has churned out a thoroughly engaging and original
thriller that lived up to it&#x27;s hype of being a thinking-person&#x27;s movie.
Not that you need an encyclopedia to guide you but I would recommend
pausing if getting up for a coffee so you miss nothing. The script
guides the audience through the action using fluent logic so as to
(thankfully) not allow any indulgence into any confusion that the
tricky concept could have easily slipped into.<br /><br />The movie has a surprisingly happy ending that has been well and truly
over-analysed by the folk on the boards. Suffice it to say that 5
minutes thinking and a dose of Occam&#x27;s Razor should allow one to
decipher what the ending is truly telling us about the protagonist.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t include plot summaries in my reviews, they are readily found on
the page. I would like to mention the acting and characterisation is
almost perfect. Almost in that Nolan could have stretched Leo even
further. Saying that, I got the feeling that some of the scenes were
done in one take since the filmmakers had only one crack at getting the
special effects right. If this was the case, it is the movie&#x27;s only
flaw.
