Inception is quite interesting and sometimes even mindbending. The
visual effects are spectacular and the acting is quite good. There&#x27;s a
lot of action in it too, so the actionfans will not be disappointed.
However the film has a few flaws, if you ask me... First of all, the
everyday-reality people live in, seem to dominate the dreamworlds in a
way that seems a little too fantastic. It is never explained how they
do what they do (enter people&#x27;s dreams to extract secret knowledge or
imprint them with ideas). A strictly scientific angle is implied (by
the drugging), but this seems only to avoid making metaphysical
statements. All we see is some drugging technique, where you push a red
button for the dream-agents to go in, but it makes no sense later, when
they go further down the dream-layers... How do they travel from a
dream, using &#x22;real&#x22; and &#x22;worldly&#x22; technology, to another layer of the
dream within the dream? It is never explained properly: they would not
have been able to import such technology into the dream. Second of all,
something is annoying about the open ending. It seems a little
ambitious for a film with that little depth and speculation about the
dream worlds... Third of all, the concept of our subconscious
defence-system, as embodied &#x22;agents&#x22; a la soldiers and swat-teams seems
a little naive. But this film is worth watching; maybe I have overrated
it a bit, but it seems to me, that nowadays, films are just plain
awful, and even though this wasn&#x27;t a new &#x22;Matrix&#x22; or &#x22;Existenz&#x22;, it is
quite entertaining and well made. Watch it!
