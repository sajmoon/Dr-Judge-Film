For several years now the corporate establishment of Hollywood has
given the world unoriginal and artistically vapid films that achieve no
other purpose than to make money. Vampire love stories and mindless
action orgies that hide their banality through fancy special effects.
Remakes, sequels, sequels of sequels, and yet worse, the occasional
Adam Sandler film. Inception is a refreshing and inspiring break from
this. It is in an elegant film that cleverly blends reality and dreams
&#x96; and dreams within dreams (within dreams) &#x96; resulting in an original
exploration of the strange world of the human mind and those who wish
to exploit its vulnerabilities. It is without doubt the best major film
of the year.<br /><br />Inception is written and directed by Christopher Nolan (The Dark
Knight). In 2000 he established himself as a daring and creative
director with Memento. Ten years later he&#x27;s surpassed Memento, making a
film that deserves to be in the same conversation with other
conscience-bending works such as The Matrix, eXistenZ, and Eternal
Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Cobb, an
agent who is hired by wealthy businessmen to entire the dreams of other
businessmen to steal their private ideas and secrets. He is a fugitive
in the US, which means he can never return to his home country to see
his children. His employer makes him an offer he cannot refuse: the
chance to return to the US and to his children with a clean slate. For
this to happen, he must enter the dreams of an heir of a business
empire and perform a task called inception. Stealing ideas is one
thing; implanting ideas into a person&#x27;s mind is another. Inception
straddles the outer boundaries of possibility, an incredibly difficult
task, as Cobb must go deep into the subconscience of his target, Robert
Fischer (played by Cillian Murphy).<br /><br />To assist him he brings a crew of dreamers, including Arthur (Joseph
Gordon-Levitt) and Ariadne, played by the adorable Ellen Page. To get
deep into the subconscience of Fischer, the crew must create a dream
world that Fischer and they enter. In this dream world, they must
create another dream world, and enter that one. In that dream world,
they must create and enter another dream world. And it doesn&#x27;t stop
there. The result is a recursive web of dreams and a narrative that is
complicated, but not overly so.<br /><br />In each level the dream intruders are attacked by armed elements of
Fischer&#x27;s subconscience, providing for fantastical and riveting action
sequences. Multiple action sequences take place simultaneously in every
level, and what happens in one dream world has a profound effect on the
nature of another dream world. The original dream world begins to
collapse, which has a ripple effect on other dreams embedded within
that one. The result is a stunning cascade of collapsing worlds in
which characters must wake up from the deepest dream before being
killed, repeating the process until they finally return to reality. The
collapsing cascade is an extraordinary achievement of direction,
storytelling, and editing. Further description of it would not do it
justice: it must be seen.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the most telling signs of the film&#x27;s success was the
audience reaction. I saw Inception on opening night in a sold out
auditorium. When the movie ended, everyone sat in silence, overcome by
the awesomeness of what they just seen. Two separate rounds of applause
ensued, accompanied by cheers and gasps of amazement. I don&#x27;t believe
I&#x27;ve ever seen such a strong audience reaction to a film.<br /><br />Cinema is a unique art form, probably the only medium in which complete
multi-dimensional worlds can be built from imagination. Inception has
achieved this in a dazzling way &#x96; it is a quintessential film, an
exemplar of what films ought to be. It presents a compelling and novel
universe, the mechanics of which have never before been dreamed of. The
film worth seeing for many reasons, most importantly because it is
innovative and audacious. Perhaps Christopher Nolan took the advice of
one of the characters in his film: &#x22;You mustn&#x27;t be afraid to dream a
little bigger, darling.&#x22;
