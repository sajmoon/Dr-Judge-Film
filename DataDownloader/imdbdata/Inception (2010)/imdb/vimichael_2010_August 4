Don&#x27;t get me wrong, &#x22;Inception&#x22; is a decent film, with beautifully
crafted CGI effects, passionate acting, and neat editing, which for any
other movie, one would be more than pleased. What bothers me about the
film is the fact that Christopher Nolan (a director I really
appreciate), doesn&#x27;t play by fair rules this time. It&#x27;s universally
understood that movies can break from conventional realities, yet when
a filmmaker creates a set of rules for the first half of the story, you
would assume that the same rules would apply throughout. Since Nolan
changes the standards he set from the onset, it&#x27;s not the type of &#x22;mind
freak&#x22; that&#x27;s fair to the audience. Given this shift in rules, the plot
does develop some holes as a result (not swiss cheese status; it&#x27;s more
like a few cracks on the asphalt). Nevertheless, they&#x27;re there if you
take the time to look and just use a little common sense in finding
them. Aside from the technical aspect, as a lucid dreamer, I&#x27;m upset
with the way Nolan uses aspects of lucid dreaming in a &#x22;Hollywood&#x22;
style plot (I won&#x27;t include spoilers, but he does use quite a few
techniques). &#x22;Inception&#x22; is not at all original. It draws from a
familiar subject that many filmmakers have used. Jake Paltrow&#x27;s &#x22;The
Good Night&#x22; is the only film I can remember that brings mention to the
actual phenomenon of Lucid Dreaming. If you&#x27;ve never experienced lucid
dreaming and want the same sensations that Leo and Ellen Page had in
the &#x22;Paris scene&#x22;, then go to Amazon.com and pick up &#x22;Exploring the
World of Lucid Dreaming&#x22; by Stephen Laberge, a famed expert on the
subject. When I read that book 13 years ago, I had my first lucid dream
that was just like that &#x22;Paris scene&#x22;. It really is the most incredible
feeling to be able to operate with your full physical senses in a
dream-scape and literally &#x22;be&#x22; in your dreams, instead of just
remembering images when you wake. Once you learn how to lucid dream,
you&#x27;ll never be the same! It&#x27;s too bad &#x22;Inception&#x22; is just another one
of those films that borrows from instead of highlights this wonderful
subject.
