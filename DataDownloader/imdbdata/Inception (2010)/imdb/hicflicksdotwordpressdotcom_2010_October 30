Greetings from hicflicks.wordpress.com !<br /><br />I went with high expectations for this movie, knowing that this was
directed by Christopher Nolan (of Memento and Dark Knight fame), and on
seeing the 9 plus (out of 10) rating that the movie got on IMDb
website. &#x27;Memento&#x27; was also a intellectual movie that required the
viewer&#x27;s 100% attention and maybe difficult for some to digest on their
first sitting. However, the ending of Memento, and the way all the dots
connected were worth the enduring sit. In case of &#x27;Inception&#x27;, I felt
clearly otherwise. Not only during half time did my head started
hurting, but I also started to get irritated by the end of it and
didn&#x27;t give a damn on the final revelation (which frankly was quite
limp).<br /><br />I remember coming out of the movie hall with my friends, feeling like I
had just given a 3 hour exam, and demanded a smoke from one of my
friends to drowse the headache that I developed during the 2.5 hours
sit. However, I gotta admit that the visuals and the background score
were quite impressive, and so was the basic premise of the story
(although it could have been developed much more). That is the only
reason I would give this flick a &#x22;Wine&#x22; rating (3 out of 5 score),
otherwise it merited an even lower rating.<br /><br />In a nutshell, watch only if you are a big Christopher Nolan fan and if
you are willing to kill some brain cells. Otherwise pass this one.
