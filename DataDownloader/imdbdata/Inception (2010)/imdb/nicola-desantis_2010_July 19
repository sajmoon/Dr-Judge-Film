The relationship between movies and dreams has always been one of the
cinema world key. The dream has always been there, in different forms
and shapes. Lots of movies around image-making power of the mind, since
decades before, lots of material released to unleash fantasies of
millions of people. But this one will be a corner stone of this kind of
movie and further. I&#x27;m not a Di Caprio fan at all, but this time, he
did amazingly well. The idea is not totally original. Just to mention a
title, The Cell is another movie, around the using of the mind, to
discover something. But Inception has a different purpose, most
centered on the use of dreams to obtain the goal. The pace of the movie
is a continuous innuendo till the last second.
