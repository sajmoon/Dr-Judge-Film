I really wanted to like Inception because of great cast, because of
stunning music, because of an interesting premise (Pros). But nope...
It needs more than that to make a movie work for me.<br /><br />Cons: There&#x27;s no character development, no engaging personal relations
and no soul... Plain action disguised as dreamworld&#x26;psych exploration.
And too much action just killed it for me. Not that I dislike some
action from time to time, especially if it serves it&#x27;s purpose (ie
Fight club, Equilibrium...) but action in Inception was it&#x27;s primary
and only relevant element. Everything other served holy action and
everything happened in the name of action. Interesting plot was there
to support action, not vice versa:( Like some of the other reviewers, I
see some similarity between this one and Shutter island (beside of
DiCaprio:) But I liked Shutter island much much more. They both pretend
to be mind twisters, tense and clever. Shutter island almost did it,
but Inception missed the point. And I blame Nolan for that. Too
pretentious director made a too pretentious movie. So just 7,3 from me
