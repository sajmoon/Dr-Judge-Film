So great to see a movie where the special effects are not superfluous.
They are wonderful in this film and add to the plot while giving added
substance to the conceptual theme.<br /><br />Leo&#x27;s best work in ages, but he doesn&#x27;t dominate or even carry the
action. All the actors give outstanding performances. I liked Joseph
Gordon-Levitt; he surprised me. The movie really moves but keeps the
audience in touch with the concepts despite the quick jumps. The music
added to the film, too.<br /><br />Congratulations Christopher Nolan and everyone associated with the
film! Thank you for a wonderful night at the movies.
