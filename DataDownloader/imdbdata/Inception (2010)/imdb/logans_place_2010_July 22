This film&#x27; is immense. The acting is refined (although Di Caprio may
just be the weakest overall) and the overall quality of production is
outstanding with attention to detail and loving flourishes that really
are making Nolan&#x27;s name. A special mention has to go out to Gordon
Levitt who is really coming of age. His 3rd rock character is now
definitely not hounding him anymore. When I saw the Matrix in 1999 I
had no idea what to expect and it blew me away with its twist on
reality and this is what Inception tries and fails to achieve. It is
big but its not clever and it is clearly defining itself as a
blockbuster but nothing more. The concept of a dream within a dream is
OK but so meekly executed despite a strong script that I wonder how
much dumbing down needed to be done to bring this film to the masses.
It would seem that a good idea has been melted down to its lowest
denominator so that it can appeal across generations but is that really
the point of these type of films? <br /><br />The base line has to be that when your dealing with a intellectual plot
that needs to get people thinking the worst you can do is sign post it
every two scenes just so the dimmest chump in the audience can join the
dots. It is like Existenz but without a twist or Minority Report
without the painful vision of the future. In short, this needed to
assert its philosophical intentions more - there was simply nothing
there to question and it certainly never made me feel like I possibly
could be living in a dream. Now where&#x27;s my totem? <br /><br />I have also taken issue with my perceived lack of interest in the
characters. The plot is so mundane that I can hardly see why these guys
are so prepared to risk all to get it. Perhaps a more global plot which
although cheesy may have added a little impetus to proceedings. I
simply did not care whether they achieved their aims or not. I did not
care that Mal was haunting Cobb or that Ariadne was even there. Talking
about Ariadne, she was very reminiscent of the silly mechanisms Nolan
used to drive &#x27;The Dark Knight&#x27; forward and yet again he has lost a
little of the magic. At least he is a visual genius. <br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed looking at the film but I can&#x27;t honestly say I
really liked it. Nolan&#x27;s flourishes and the sheer quality are
everything I have wanted in a film but oh my there is a issue with plot
sophistication here. It just needed to be a little smarter.
