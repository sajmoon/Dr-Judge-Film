The most important thing I adore about Hollywood movies is that they
never die out of ideas. Inception is no exception; the concept
presented in inception is very unique and refreshing. And it&#x27;s not only
the idea but how Christopher Nolan has presented it was epitome of
direction. Though the story is very complicated and everything is
happening in hustle and bustle but still you are glued to your seats.
The way movie unrolls it self is immaculate work of A class director.
All the cast did justice to their roles. Leonardo DiCaprio was very
convincing as guilty stricken husband and desperate father to meet his
children again. I had never doubted the capabilities of Leonardo and he
didn&#x27;t disappoint me. Oscar veteran Marion Cotillard was very promising
as perplexed wife who was the first victim of inception. I think
inception is one of the finest works by Nolan till now.
