the movie is good , and professionally directed (however there is still
some few flaws), acting is quite good too.<br /><br />BUT 9.3 on IMDb , EXCUSE ME GUYS YOU MUST BE KIDDING, i gave it 8/10
and it was better if i could give it 7.5/10<br /><br />the movie is straight forward for me it is not that deep like others
think and i cannot see that it is discussing the idea of true
reality!!!, and if the writer does mean to, then forgive me if i have
to say this was so &#x22;SHALLOW&#x22; <br /><br />this is not the kind of philosophic movies, and it is not asking for
answers to the common questions like the truth of our life and the
difference between dreams and reality ,etc ....<br /><br />it was just a quite entertaining movie wearing that dreams suit and
comparing it to matrix is completely irrelevant.<br /><br />for whom who like Nolan this is another good Nolan movie &#x22;no more&#x22;
