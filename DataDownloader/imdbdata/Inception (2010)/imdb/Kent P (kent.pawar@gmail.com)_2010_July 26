If you want to understand &#x27;Inception&#x27; (movie) when you watch it for the
first time itself, then you need to know the below prerequisites (don&#x27;t
worry, no spoilers ahead). After I watched the movie and discussed it
with a couple others, I realized that many would have understood and
further enjoyed the movie if they were aware of a few well known
concepts. Besides this, you will obviously have to pay close attention
to the dialog!<br /><br />So here are some &#x27;Prerequisites to watching Inception&#x27;:<br /><br />1. The sounds and movements happening around you while u sleep, may
manifest in some form in your dream. E.g. You may dream of gunfire if a
loud washing machine is running nearby and so on... <br /><br />2. Sigmund Freud divided mind into the conscious mind or ego and two
parts of the unconscious: the id or instincts and the superego. While
we are aware and in control of our conscious mind, we don&#x27;t have such
awareness of the subconscious (unconscious mind). E.g. A person who is
lying may subconsciously: attempt to divert attention away from the
lie, avoid eye contact, fidget and so on.<br /><br />So its possible to &#x27;extract information&#x27; to a certain extent from a
person under hypnosis, the movie takes this a step further. How? Well
you will have to watch the movie to find out!<br /><br />3. Current technology can monitor brain wave activity to a certain
level. Theoretically, in the future it may be possible to project
signals directly into the brain itself. Something like the cartoon
Jetsons, where Elroy selects a dream and the dream machine placed over
his head will project that dream into his mind. So it may be possible
to (literally) &#x27;enter&#x27; into someone else&#x27;s dream.<br /><br />4. Lastly, we can control and alter our dreams while we are still
dreaming. This is know as &#x27;Lucid dreaming&#x27; which is very cool, so read
more about it!
