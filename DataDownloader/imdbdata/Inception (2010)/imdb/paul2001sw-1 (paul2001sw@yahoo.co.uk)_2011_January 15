Ten years ago, Christopher Nolan wrote and directed the brilliant
&#x27;Momento&#x27;, a stunning thriller that pushed the boundaries of
storytelling convention. It was great, but still, one couldn&#x27;t help
wondering, where would Nolan go from here? How could he trump this
achievement? In fact, although his subsequent films have been praised,
they&#x27;ve been less distinctive, but with &#x27;Inception&#x27;, he returns to his
adventurous roots, producing a story that is even more audacious than
&#x27;Momento&#x27;; and unfortunately, the result is dreadful. And worse than
the fact that it doesn&#x27;t really work is the fact that while it is
distinctive, it is distinctive in a very conventional way. Since his
early success, Nolan has taken work from big studios, and &#x27;Inception&#x27;
is no exception; and the result is a Hollywood movie straining
desperately to stand out, instead of something more truly independent.
in spirit.<br /><br />To make the point in more detail, &#x27;Inception&#x27; features a starry cast
(I&#x27;m, afraid for me, the casting of Leonardo diCaprio has become a
clear sign of a poor film with pretensions); an implausibly attractive
geeky female assistant; loads of expository dialogue (at one point, it
is explained that someone is the most powerful media baron in the world
&#x96; i.e. they appear to be so powerful that no-one had heard of them);
fast pace and Jason Bourne style camera work; sub-&#x27;Matrix&#x27; style ideas
about the nature of reality, superficially intriguing and certainly
confusing, but of little philosophical depth; extraordinary special
effects; and above all else, a plot comprising an incoherent sequence
of random set-piece scenes that seems constructed to showcase said
special effects rather than because it makes sense as a story. It may
sound like an intriguing idea to have the cast simultaneously fighting
for their lives in seven different nested dream-spaces, but in fact, it
isn&#x27;t; multiplying the threat to the heroes only reduces the dramatic
impact of each one.<br /><br />To give Nolan credit, he has made a wholly cinematic film; you
certainly couldn&#x27;t imagine this in book form. Sadly it&#x27;s very hard to
imagine it as a screenplay either, or as any sort of story. And it was
story, not special effects, that made &#x27;Momento&#x27; great; and while that
story was highly unusual, it made internal sense. But less is never
more in Hollywood; and sadly, more is often just a mess.
