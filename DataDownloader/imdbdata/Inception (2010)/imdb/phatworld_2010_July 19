Inception is one of the most amazing movies ever created. It&#x27;s an
enveloping epic with so many layers it&#x27;s hard to imagine it is an
intense action movie. I give this movie such high marks because it is
so intense throughout, igneous and unique. The visual effects and
choices of slow motion shots beat the crap out of 3D movies. The plot
did at times seemed forced in order to further, but being one of the
most complex stories fairly easy to follow without making it full of
holes is something of an amazement. There was a scene where a character
sharply looks at another character with the camera in first person; the
guy next to us jumped so much he threw his popcorn. The movie had so
many white knuckle moments I felt juiced and exhausted afterward. I
often think movies are too expensive, this one was a bargain, I would
have paid double. They really worked hard on this story and effects;
the preview doesn&#x27;t do this movie justice.
