2010_November 6 
Last Friday,I grab hold of this DVD,and to tell you the truth,I was
very impressed with the film completely!The acting in my opinion was
quite good(especially from the lead actor Leonardo Dicarprio) and the
direction was so interesting (since the film is directed by Christopher
Nolan,I kinda expected it to be as good as his previous film,The Dark
Knight to be more interesting) that I was instantly hooked and touched
by the movie(despite the film being very complex and complicated with a
lot of heavy dialog)!I also found the idea very intriguing and powerful
that once this technology really exists,that it can completely changed
the world and the way our cooperate society works!I also found the film
to be completely touched and how your personal feelings of lost can
completely destroy your mission or how it can influence your dream and
blurs the line between realities and the world of the subconscious!I
also found the special effects completely awesome(especially the part
where Arthur was floating in the hotel room) and the CGI
commendable(since the director decided not to use many CGI on this
movie)!Since I didn&#x27;t want to reveal much of the plot,overall this film
is not for entertainment but is for those who love to think a lot!This
film is definitely worth a second watch for understanding!(the first
time I saw,I watch it for some action but soon enough I will watch it
for clues!By far,this is one of the Christopher Nolan&#x27;s best film and
the most original and intriguing science fiction film of the year(worth
being nominated at this years Oscars!)Worth a watch!
