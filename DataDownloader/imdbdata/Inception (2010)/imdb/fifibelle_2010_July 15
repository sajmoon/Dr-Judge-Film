Do not let anyone tell you anything about this movie before you go see
it. It is best experienced with thrilled expectations -- and you will
not be disappointed. The acting by all cast members is terrific, the
story line is amazing, and the special effects are breathtaking. I am
so honored to have attended a sneak preview of this movie. The theater
was packed without one empty seat and the crowd was so into the movie,
it was silent until the end. Their reaction at the end was loud and
vocal. I will admit that I got a terrible tension headache from the
intensity of being a part of this experience. But I will never ever
forget the movie. I also must admit there were several times while
watching the movie that I wanted someone to explain things to me (I
commented to my husband -- WTF?) but rode it out, thinking,
comprehending and understanding. I do think that younger people will
&#x22;get&#x22; the story better than older people, since they play multi-tiered
level games, so the concept won&#x27;t be so difficult to wrap their brains
around it. Outside the theater afterward, no one would leave -- they
just stood around talking about it, reliving scenes, ideas and
concepts. This is THE movie to see!
