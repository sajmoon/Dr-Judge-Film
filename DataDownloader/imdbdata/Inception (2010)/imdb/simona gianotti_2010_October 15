No doubt the 148 minute time-run of &#x22;Inception&#x22; does not bore the
viewer who keeps almost attached to the screen in order to follow each
passage, trying not to lose any little piece which may be essential to
understand the whole. Indeed, the picture is well structured, each
passage well explained, each step told and retold, so that we are led
through without getting lost in the apparent maze. The power of human
mind appears as something infinite, but well controllable. In the end,
everything gets a meaning, every piece matches with the others. But
this was in my opinion also the limit of the movie, the pretence that
human dreams, which are still considered as part of the most irrational
side of man, may become so lucidly rational. We find Dom Cobb (Leonardo
di Caprio) planning dreams, structuring them into more levels, a true
architect of the mind, stealing ideas, introducing ideas into other
people&#x27;s mind, as if, in the end, the human mind were only reason and
control. As if any mystery were cancelled and each one became a
vulnerable puppet whose most inner secrets could be stolen from deep
within the subconscious. I am probably an incurable supporter of the
mystery of human beings, and cannot accept too much rationality, but
this aspect of the movie in a way disappointed me. Thankfully the
character of Mal, Cobb&#x27;s wife, helps give the movie some sense of the
uncontrollable within human life, something belonging to emotion and
memories, which may be stronger, against any rational power. And, in
the end, we are also no longer sure of the distinction between dream
and reality, which urges the viewer to let some rationality aside and
let the mystery find its own space. A movie which however proves very
well built, having a good direction supporting it, and needless to say,
the always talented performance by Di Caprio leaves the mark.
