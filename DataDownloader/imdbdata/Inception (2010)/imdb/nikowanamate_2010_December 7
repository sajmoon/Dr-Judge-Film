there have been a huge number of comparisons between this film and the
matrix, and if this is true, then i&#x27;m sorry to say this film won&#x27;t be
winning best picture or best director. true that film is good, and
enjoyable, but the film can be disheartening at times, because you as
an audience have to work to keep up with the movie. though i understood
it, i felt cheated because i ended up explain what had just happened to
my mother, who was left dazed and confused about what had just
happened.<br /><br />the film, moved through fantastically, but the start was a bit of a
giveaway, that this film will end on an annoying note. though i like
what Christopher Nolan did, i was greatly disappointed that he took
more time in telling the movie, than he did telling the actuals story,
if you get what i mean. <br /><br />i can certainly see why people are quick to say this will win best
picture (because the dark knight didn&#x27;t) we mustn&#x27;t think like that, if
we are to say every physcological thriller had to win best picture
because it&#x27;s entertaining, then the Oscar has lost it&#x27;s merit because
it&#x27;s supposed to celebrate films, not a specific person.
