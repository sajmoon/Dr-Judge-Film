It seems like Leonardo DiCaprio is really going for these Psychological
thrillers lately, which is good, as he seems to pull it off quite
nicely.<br /><br />As usual, Christofer Nolan has created another great movie which is
well shot, superbly acted and grips your attention from scene 1 -
although at that point you really have no idea what is going on! My one
point of criticism on an otherwise amazing movie is that he takes the
concept one step too far. Towards the end keeping up with what&#x27;s
happening where becomes a full time task and although I don&#x27;t want to
come over as stupid, one less would have made the film flow much
smoother.<br /><br />Enjoy!
