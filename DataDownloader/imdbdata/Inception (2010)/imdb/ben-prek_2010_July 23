Yes! That was my reply when I saw the ending of the movie. It&#x27;s
absolutely genius! Why? Well... The way Nolan represents the human sub
conscience, the way the movie just takes you in to itself... It&#x27;s
genius. The part of the movie, that made a big impact on me, was its
ending. For to many years, the bulk of the movies, that were rated 7,5
and above and were declared the best movies of those years, presented
one side of an ending. The main character is in 80% of the time
schizophrenic and so the ending of the movie comes with a Keyzer Soze
ending, or more commonly known as a TWIST. But after seeing Shutter
Isalnd and Inception, I started to wonder... Is this sort of ending,
portrayed in these two movies becoming the new &#x22;THE ENDING&#x22; ? I hope
so. Sure, it comes with a twist, BUT... This sort of twist gives you
ONLY two possible endings. Which you prefer is up to you. It is not
like in Donnie Darko, where you have 287 correct endings =) it is not
like The Usual Suspects, which started the so called TWISTs, where you
learn at the end of the movie, that the way you interpreted the movie
was wrong... This &#x22;NEW&#x22; ending keeps you hanging. An I love it. To sum
up, the movie is brilliant. It portraits our subconscious in an action
way?! Wow! OK, how many of you, that gave the movie a &#x22;bad rating&#x22;
would come up with this idea. It shows our philosophy and psychology in
a simple but complex way. It really is a work of art! The only bad
thing about this movie is, the acting of Leo. Don&#x27;t get me wrong...
But... Have you noticed, that his acting is the same from The Departed
forth?! Same expressions, same moves, same look... I hope this is just
because of the roles he plays, and that he still has an ace up his
sleeve for us. Anyway, the movie is simply a must-see and I predict an
instant cult classic... In more ways than one! Have a nice one!
