Not many directors have had such a successful career as Christopher
Nolan. Ranging from great films like &#x27;Memento&#x27; to masterpieces like
&#x27;The Dark Knight&#x27;, Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite directors of
the past decade, even if he hasn&#x27;t released many films...<br /><br />I had extremely high expectations for this film after I saw the trailer
(the year before). Leonardo DiCaprio was underrated and Christopher
Nolan was man full of smart turns and mind-blowing scripts. The film
(itself) had a brilliant plot, which was very intriguing for me.<br /><br />After I saw the film, I realized how right I actually was! Inception is
the rare film of the year that exceeds as a blockbuster, as well as a
great film. Not many films can accomplish just &#x27;that&#x27;, and that&#x27;s what
makes Inception worth your time and money.<br /><br />The performances brilliant, but who really exceeds this time is
DiCaprio. He plays his character towards ultra perfection and emotional
consensus. He is perfect as Cobb. The rest of the cast is good too:
Caine, Page, Hardy, Levitt, Cotiliard, Watanabe, and Murphy pull of a
perfect, yet mesmerizing job.<br /><br />The script is absolutely dashing. Nolan does a much better job that
&#x27;The Dark Knight&#x27;. Mind-blowing and truly original are the words that
describe it. The Direction couldn&#x27;t have been better. Again, all thanks
to Nolan, because of his complex universe.<br /><br />Overall, Inception is probably the best film you&#x27;ll see this year,
certainly the best of its genre (sci-fi). Christopher Nolan creates a
complex, yet mesmerizing world of his own! Everyone will simply praise
this film, and it won&#x27;t be forgotten for sure. Go see Inception now,
and you surely won&#x27;t be disappointed. You can even watch this film over
and over again to completely understand it! 10/10
