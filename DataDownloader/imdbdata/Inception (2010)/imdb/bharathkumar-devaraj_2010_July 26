Two things stuck me when the credits starts rolling.<br /><br />1.Did the movie ran for 2 hrs and 30 mins and 2.What did I just saw?<br /><br />Indeed the movie ran for 2 hrs and 30 mins and the what I saw in the 2
hrs and 30 mins is genius mind game. I won&#x27;t be lying saying I
understood the movie completely but in meantime it is not confusing as
many reviews suggest at least to me. Yes the plot is complex but it is
not confusing and the screenplay aids well to understand the complexity
which is genius screenplay writing. <br /><br />When I saw the teaser trailer some 8 months back, I can not wait to
watch the movie and damn I am not disappointed.it&#x27;s pure cinematic
experience and you have to feel the experience in theatres.<br /><br />As I already mentioned, the screenplay is so genius but what can a
genius screenplay can do without good acting. Fortunately for Nolan, he
has the Mr.Perfect Leo to aid his screenplay.What a transformation this
guy is having. Still the the memories of Jack from Titanic is fresh but
he leaped with performances in Aviator, Departed and my fav Blood
Diamond. He is getting better and better and wish him to win the golden
statue for his performance.Nolan rightly deserves one this time.The
other supporting cast did a great job and near flawless performance.<br /><br />The music, it aids the pace of the movie very well and it does not make
you disorient when you try to pay attention to such a complex
storyline.My fav is John powell and to me the score for Bourne movies
outstand anything in recent times but the Hans zimmer did a very good
job here.<br /><br />Finally, Nolan.He will be celebrated for the works he has done so far
in decades to come. Direction or screenplay he proves he is good in
whatever he is doing.Memento is my personal fav and I was blown away
with Prestige and Batman Begins. Who can make batman franchise what it
is today when preceded by Batman &#x26; Robin?He set a benchmark for comic
book movie adaption and now he sets the bench mark for psychological
thrillers with Inception. A must watch and a perfect summer
blockbuster. 10/10
