Wow. I really mean it, WOW. A Hollywood blockbuster that doesn&#x27;t only
deliver action and special effects galore, but which also has a perfect
screenplay, enough depth and which raises enough moral questions. A
film which adventure/thriller lovers worldwide will praise for years to
come and which critics are hailing as this year&#x27;s best film (so far).
Who would ever have thought that such a commercial film could pack such
a punch? Yes, I am talking about Christopher Nolan&#x27;s recent
&#x22;Inception&#x22;...so it makes sense, doesn&#x27;t it? Perhaps the only
mainstream director who can actually make intelligent Hollywood
thrillers (let&#x27;s not forget 2008&#x27;s &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22; which will live on
for eternity), he continues to live up to his name.<br /><br />As we&#x27;ve seen from his previous films (&#x22;Memento&#x22;, &#x22;Insomnia&#x22; and &#x22;The
Dark Knight&#x22;), Nolan excels at playing with his audience&#x27;s minds and
twisting the story to such complex but perfectly understandable depths
that we can&#x27;t help but marvel and be awed. This is one such film, which
I&#x27;m sure will prompt film lovers to sit for hours in caf&#xE9;s and
restaurants discussing the plot and which, try as they might, won&#x27;t
have a flaw to its name. It takes place in a very near future, where
the ability to link two or more people while they sleep merges their
dreams and creates an alternate reality. In their dreams, these people
can imagine and live out fictional adventures which might never be
possible...but they can also unconsciously reveal their deepest
secrets. There&#x27;s a secret agent Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is known
for his complex imagination and for being able to wrestle any hidden
truth while jointly controlling their dreams; he&#x27;s being hired by Saito
(Ken Watanabe), the CEO for a huge company which seeks to control most
of the world&#x27;s energy resources. The only thing standing in Saito&#x27;s way
is Fischer (Cillian Murphy), his greatest competitor&#x27;s son, who&#x27;s about
to inherit his father&#x27;s entire corporation.<br /><br />Saito approaches Cobb with the task of performing an &#x27;inception&#x27; on
Fischer. An &#x27;inception&#x27; is when someone enters a person&#x27;s subconscious
via their dreams and plants an idea within, thereby changing their
thoughts and tampering with their will. What Cobb is being hired to do
is to mess with Fischer&#x27;s thoughts and dreams and to incite him into
breaking up his father&#x27;s corporation; in return, Saito will use his
contacts to free Cobb of the erroneous charge of murdering his wife,
Mal (Marion Cotillard), thereby permitting him to return to the U.S.A.
to live with his kids again. To do such a complicated procedure as
&#x27;inception&#x27;, Cobb enlists the help of his right-hand man (Joseph
Gordon-Levitt), a talented dream architect (Ellen Page), a wise forger
(Tom Hardy) and a respected anesthesiologist (Dileep Rao), but he&#x27;ll
find that so many different imaginations pose a veritable threat to all
their sanities including his own, which is plagued by the memory of Mal
and her fictional appearance in all their dream sequences that aim to
destroy their plan.<br /><br />To try and explain the plot in more detail is absolute madness; it&#x27;s so
complicated and multi-layered that I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one who
has trouble making sense of the entire m&#xE9;lange. But unlike other films
whose complexity leads to their downfall, &#x22;Inception&#x22; is enriched by it
and the audience doesn&#x27;t find too much trouble in understanding it all
as the film goes along. Audiences and critics alike have called it
&#x22;mind-blowing&#x22; and, believe me, that&#x27;s just THE right word to describe
this feat. You&#x27;ll feel dizzied and disoriented for many hours after the
film&#x27;s over because it deals with so many levels of consciousness and
dreams, it poses so many existential questions and it furiously toggles
between reality and imagination where we&#x27;re dragged to question our own
realities and our own convictions.<br /><br />Like any other Hollywood film, it&#x27;s packed with almost non-stop action,
thrills and special effects, but the intelligent dialogue, the
excellent characterization and the frequent twists and turns always
keep it interesting. It&#x27;s one of those movies where the suspense grabs
hold of you since the very first scene and doesn&#x27;t let go until the
credits start to roll. It has Nolan&#x27;s name and reputation stamped out
all over it, and even being close to three hours long, it&#x27;s so fast
paced you won&#x27;t notice time fly by (it feels no more than an hour
long). Simply stated, this movie reminds us why we like to go to the
multiplex, why we love the movies: it&#x27;s both artistic and entertaining.<br /><br />All of the acting is superb (I mean, just look at the long list of
A-list stars it has, including Oscar nominees DiCaprio, Watanabe, Page
and Oscar winners Cotillard and Michael Caine). The cinematography is
perfect, the ominous score shatters your nerves, the production design
is the stuff of dreams and the screenplay (its best asset by far) is as
original and refreshing as they come. We&#x27;re already in the middle of
August and so far I must agree with what is being proclaimed around the
world: that this is the best movie of the year so far! See it! I can&#x27;t
stress this enough. Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!
