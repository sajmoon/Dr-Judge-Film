As a reviewer, proclaiming that a film is the &#x22;best film you have ever
seen&#x22; is a bold statement. After all, you risk losing all credibility
with your reader, especially if you say some stupid sh*t like Twilight.
Despite this, I&#x27;m gonna say it: Inception is the best film I have ever
seen (with the exception of 2001: A Space Odyssey). <br /><br />The film opens with Cobb (Leonardo Dicaprio) explaining the viral
nature of an &#x22;idea&#x22; and how once formed, it spreads and grows within
the human mind like wildfire. You see, Cobb is essentially a thief, an
extractor- for-hire who enters a subject&#x27;s subconscious through their
dreams and steals their ideas for his employer. His most recent job,
however, is not to steal an idea but instead implant one within the
subject&#x27;s mind &#x96; a supposedly impossible task known as inception. <br /><br />At first glance, Inception may seem like your typical action film that
borrows sci-fi elements to try and seem clever. The difference is,
Inception actually is clever. Nolan takes a simple idea (dreams) and
builds it into a narrative with more substance, depth and complexity
than 99% of Hollywood films today. This, coupled with fleshed-out
characters, breathtaking special effects and an outstanding score by
Hans Zimmer, leaves you with a film that is not only extremely
entertaining but also thought-provoking in its genuine intelligence. <br /><br />However, where the film rises above all others is in its emotion. Films
like Inception are usually so focused on the story that the characters
are pushed into the background, leaving you with an engaging but
ultimately heartless narrative. The emotional aspect of Inception,
however, is not only its focus, but also the driving force that weaves
the entire film together. <br /><br />Following from his success with The Dark Knight, Nolan has once again
outdone himself. Inception is a masterpiece on all levels &#x96; mesmerizing
in its intellect, enthralling in its action and heartfelt in its
emotion. This is about as perfect as any film can get.
