Christopher Nolan blazed on to the scene in 1998 with his film
Following. Depending on who you are or how much of a Nolan enthusiast
you are, you might have seen his first work, Doodlebug from the year
before. Nolan&#x27;s newest and probably most cleverly written film
Inception, has Nolan exploring his own head and dimensions since his
1998 work. It&#x27;s incredible how this writer/director has made such a
name for himself in such a short period of time. Although all his works
aren&#x27;t magnificent (Insomnia being not one of his finest), he places a
stamp and an edge on each of his works that makes the film completely
recognizable as a Nolan film. Just look at his little film called The
Dark Knight.<br /><br />Inception doesn&#x27;t rip off other films that are likely to be the
comparisons like The Matrix, it reinvents a genre and almost recreates
it as if we&#x27;re seeing it for the first time. The synopsis was a big
secret coming down to opening day and I did my very best to not know
what the film was about. I&#x27;m proud to say I succeeded, and I will
continue to respect any person who hasn&#x27;t seen the picture yet and
wants to remain in the dark. If people see the trailer or poster,
you&#x27;ll know it has something to do about dreams. That&#x27;s a spot on
description I might say.<br /><br />The performances are not stand out, loud, or boisterous to be
considered Oscar threats in the race for 2010 but they&#x27;re accessible,
respectable, and all deliver some great work. Star of the film Leonardo
DiCaprio performs top notch and has landed himself into a great place
as one of the best working actors in Hollywood. He&#x27;s unstoppable as the
tortured character &#x22;Cobb&#x22; and what his work does here is improve his
chances at Oscar consideration, the question is what film will they
embrace, this, or his earlier magnificent performance in Martin
Scorsese&#x27;s Shutter Island.<br /><br />One of the best things about the film, besides Nolan&#x27;s impeccable
writing style, is his choice of constructing the best cast ensemble of
the year so far. Supporting players are all on their A-game, showing
charisma and emotional depth. The player most worthy and in the hunt
for an Oscar nomination is Academy Award Winner Marion Cotillard who
remains beautiful as ever but delivers her most terrifying portrayal
yet. 500 Days of Summer star Joseph Gordon-Levitt has just made himself
one of the coolest actors in Hollywood. His action scenes are the most
dynamic and entertaining which makes him one of the more likable actors
of the film. Ellen Page is fun, satisfying, and sufficient. Page has
long left her Juno work behind her and is moving forward to be a more
progressive and challenging actress. It&#x27;s always so good to see Oscar
nominee Ken Watanabe still working and showing great work. His
breakthrough role in Edward Zwick&#x27;s The Last Samurai was in serious
danger of being his one-hit wonder, but he shows he&#x27;s here for a while.
Tom Hardy, star of last year&#x27;s explosive British film, Bronson, has
just established himself in the states of a capable and competent
performer. Hardy is the topping on this sweet, sweet cake of a film.
Cillian Murphy, like always, keeps his character at a distance from the
viewers, only allowing us to see what he wants us to see. Murphy is the
secret greatness in Inception. Dileep Rao (James Cameron&#x27;s Avatar),
Michael Caine (Oscar Winner for The Cider House Rules), Pete
Postlethwaite (Oscar nominee, Jim Sheridan&#x27;s In the Name of the
Father), and Tom Berenger (Oscar nominee, Oliver Stone&#x27;s Platoon) are
all added surpluses.<br /><br />Technical work here is breathtaking including Wally Pfister&#x27;s
incredible Cinematography, Lee Smith&#x27;s perfect Editing, and Hans
Zimmer&#x27;s sensational score are the three most likely Oscar contenders
and feasible frontrunners. Sound and Visual crew are right there and
close behind to land themselves in serious contention.<br /><br />But again, enough can&#x27;t be said about Christopher Nolan. I see him
finally holding an Oscar this year for his writing work here and I
wouldn&#x27;t count him out for a Directing bid either. He&#x27;s in top form and
with a Best Picture category expanded to ten, this is a film the fans
and &#x22;regular&#x22; audiences can get behind to boost Oscar ratings.<br /><br />Inception is sensational. The second best of the year (depending on who
you are, Toy Story 3 may have this beat by a smidge) and Christopher
Nolan&#x27;s best screenplay of his career.
