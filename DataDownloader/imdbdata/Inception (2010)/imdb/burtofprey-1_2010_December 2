I didn&#x27;t like anything about this movie and I don&#x27;t understand why
people rate it high. Why do people lately anyway like movies that are
inarticulate? The dreams were stupid and the characters too. Who cares
anyway what happens in this film? <br /><br />Usually I can appreciate sci fi movies like Solaris. They are great to
me and I enjoy the mystery and the futuristic scenery. But sadly
Inception is pretentious and empty. <br /><br />I have to admit, I could only watch it for 1 hour, then I had to leave
because it was a waste of my time, I rather do nothing actually. All
along the movie the actors kept explaining things, and that killed the
integral. <br /><br />I don&#x27;t know why a wonderful actor like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who has
done some very artistic independent movies, wants to play this
cardboard man? Leonardo diCaprio in Shutter Island will always be one
of my favorite parts ever. <br /><br />You know what? It&#x27;s that &#x22;Look at me I&#x27;m very important&#x22; style of
acting that I dislike with Inception. It takes itself way too serious
while the plot is no more than a thumbed B comic.
