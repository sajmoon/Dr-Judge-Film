http://critical-eruditass.blogspot.com/p/about-blog.html<br /><br />Inception Review, with ROT13 spoilers. This is a movie you don&#x27;t want
to know anything about before watching.<br /><br />Characters: 1 <br /><br />Screenplay: 4 <br /><br />Cinematography: 2 <br /><br />Emotional: 3 <br /><br />Overall: 3.5<br /><br />Although not without its flaws, the premise and execution stands out as
an epic. To draw unnecessary comparisons, it had Taken&#x27;s pacing (not
action scenes) and excitement with Matrix&#x27;s imagination and depth,
combined with good directing and immersion. The film had bits of
action, suspense, drama, and of course thrills while touching on
worthwhile subjects like love, family, meta-thought, and the evil of
that men do. It does a great job of getting the viewer invested in the
outcome of the movie.<br /><br />Its weaknesses include mostly flat characters, unrealized ambition,
unimaginative action scenes and a bit of hand-waving.<br /><br />I&#x27;d think it was a competent release. Close to excellent, but not
quite. An intelligent, thrilling ride that immerses you from start to
finish with some flaws.<br /><br />Characters: One of Inception&#x27;s weak points is its characters. Amongst
the one-dimensional characters, weak character development, and minimal
character exploration is the character-driven story. I never was able
to identify with characters or care fare about their outcomes.<br /><br />The story revolves around the classic dark and mysterious protagonist.
To me, it is a slight disappointment that the other characters remain
within the shadows. It does keep the movie focused and from getting too
complex, as well as give headway to one interesting interpretation.<br /><br />DiCaprio does -okay- with the only role requiring strong acting. I
would&#x27;ve liked to see more emotion in him, given what he was dealing
with. You could attribute the other parts of his personality being
played by his projections. The rest of cast does a good job of filling
in their respective characters. I really wanted to see bigger shoes to
fill for Page, who did feel a bit miss-cast.<br /><br />Screenplay: A smashing success. This is what made this movie such a big
hit across the board. The viewer is thrown into the action, and runs
along with the movie. From the opening scene, the film establishes that
you will have the pleasure observing something special, grandiose, and
unique. It succeeds in maintaining that level of novelty throughout the
majority of the film. The last hour of the film is complex and
beautifully done. And there are little gems of depth are sprinkled
throughout.<br /><br />However, there is no downtime to process, and if you get caught up on
the psychological insights, it can be a little hard to digest. The
pacing could have used a bit more variety. There are points where it
felt the story was being pushed along. For example, Cobb and his team
constantly seemed to jump around all over the world. Also, due to the
narrow focus of the film, there world of Inception seems a small and
obscure and is juxtaposed against the grandiose premise.<br /><br />Overall, plot was very pleasingly intricate, with a twist-and-turn,
keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type feel. The beauty of the
screenplay is its symbolism and the open interpretation of the story.
There are red herrings placed all throughout. Analysts and film buffs
can be gluttons for discussion. For example, here is a list of
theories: Cinematography: The world of Inception is captured quite
well. This film was very good at drawing me in for hours and
transporting me to an alternative world. The viewers, having been
explained parts of the concept, get to both see and feel premise and
rules of the world around them. Suspension of disbelief becomes
natural. The music flows wonderfully, save the never-ending climatic
music at the end.<br /><br />That said, in the aftermath, I was left wanting more imagination in a
dream movie. The premise was novel, but the sets, action/fight/chase
scenes could have been much more.<br /><br />Emotional: Despite the weak characters, Inception had everyone invested
in the outcome of the story. Why? It felt so epic, with nuggets of
insight, imaginative expansion on what we experience every day, and
pacing.<br /><br />It set out to be very ambitious and deep, but the ideas are never
developed and aspects remain unexplained. I didn&#x27;t care about what
happened for most of the characters and whether or not their lives were
at stake. I just liked watching it because it was well put together.
