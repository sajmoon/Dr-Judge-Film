2010_November 7 
After the first Matrix movie was released, there was this consistent
rumour that predicted the Matrix itself was a simulation in a deeper
Matrix still. Inception is like that rumour was translated into a
movie, only without Agent Smith. What can I say... there are turtles
all the way down. The casting of Leo de Caprio is funny to me. Just
after a movie where we&#x27;ve explored his subconscious, we go deeper. The
movie starts with him on a beach, too.<br /><br />But let me tell you about the movie. It is very well done, the tension
is palpable and the effort that went into creating the dream worlds is
top notch. I am not talking about computer effects only, but also about
entire action scenes that reminded of Matrix just a little bit too
much. While the idea (ahem) of the film is simple enough, its
implementation navigates in a labyrinth of subconscious worlds, several
levels deep. I only wish the first half would have been clearer,
without so much chasing and shooting. The action scenes were good, but
almost irrelevant to the plot.<br /><br />Bottom line: expect something a bit vague, that you must not strive to
understand right away or, indeed, make total sense. It is a good idea
which was put well in a movie. Oh, and Ellen Page is not completely
annoying in the movie either. A cast that was too good for the roles
many of them got, with episodic appearances by legends such as Michael
Caine, Pete Postlethwaite or even Tom Berenger. This quickly washed
away my disappointment of Lukas Haas&#x27; short role. The movie was good,
but a religion? Not a chance. Stick to simpler psychological archetypes
like a Messiah fighting a supercomputer to push that one.
