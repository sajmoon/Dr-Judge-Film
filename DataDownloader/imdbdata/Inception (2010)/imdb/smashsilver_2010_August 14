Many may consider martin Scorsese to be one of the greatest directors
of all time, these MAY be the same people who predicted the world would
end in the year 2010 - it hasn&#x27;t - and clearly Scorsese isn&#x27;t.<br /><br />To my mind the title of &#x27;&#x27;the worlds best living director&#x27;&#x27; is fast
belonging to the writer/director of inception - Christopher Nolan. Not
only has Nolan wrote or co-wrote - unlike 90% of Scorsese&#x27;s movies -
all but one of his film&#x27;s, (insomnia) but in doing so he has also
equaled Stanley Kubrick in never directing a film, that wasn&#x27;t good.<br /><br />However in the last two years, Christopher Nolan&#x27;s two most recent
film&#x27;s have easily outdone ( and I don&#x27;t give this type of praise
easily) any director in that they have both been - back to back -
masterpieces.<br /><br />However If you THOUGHT that his first film after the dark knight would
struggle to live up to even equal - let alone exceed it&#x27;s predecessor
-you&#x27;d of thought correct; but thankfully have been proved -
miraculously - wrong.<br /><br />Because Inception is one of the strongest most exceptionally crafted
film&#x27;s I&#x27;ve ever seen, made - since the release of the Shawshank
redemption.<br /><br />It tells the story of Don Cob a man who&#x27;s profession, is in stealing
ideas from peoples dreams, through a process known as extraction. <br /><br />However the art of Inception - planting an idea inside someone&#x27;s mind
through dream invasion - has now been made his final purpose, (through
a Japanese businessman) so that he may lead a normal life.<br /><br />What follows is truly an extraordinarily well crafted drama/ thriller/
/fantasy/action/ sci - fie ( it honestly is a combination of all) -
that as the film critic Richard Roeper correctly pointed out - is
genuinely the best made film of the 21st century.
