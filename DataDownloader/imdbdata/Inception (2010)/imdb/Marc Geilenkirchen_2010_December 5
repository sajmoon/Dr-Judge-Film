2010_December 5 
Actually I&#x27;m still in doubt about this movie.<br /><br />I had the impression I was looking at a visual representation of
psycho-analysis. I got also irritated by constantly being reminded
about Matrix. I got a bored by the rather poor visual effects (but OK -
let&#x27;s not be snobby: there can be only 1 Avatar and that scene of
folding Paris is quite breathtaking (I admit) and the weightless-scenes
are very funny). <br /><br />So all together I&#x27;m still in doubt about this film.<br /><br />But that&#x27;s OK - I just have to see it again. And propably again, and
again. But Allen Page and Marion Cotillard make th&#xE1;t worth anyway.
