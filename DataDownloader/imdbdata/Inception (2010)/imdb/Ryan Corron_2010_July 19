Let me start out by saying I went in seeing this movie with hardly any
knowledge of what the movie was about, or what to even expect. To put
it simply, I was amazed. The movie was flawless. From the opening scene
to the credits, the movie is testing your intellectual capabilities to
keep track of everything that is happening. After seeing Inception you
will immediately want to watch it over again just to make sure you had
caught every detail. As far as the cinematography goes - incredible.
The dullest scene in the movie will have no trouble keeping your eyes
from looking away while some of the scenes are just plain insane. You
will be blown away. The soundtrack is perfectly intense and keeps your
emotional juices flowing throughout. The acting is superb, as well.
Leonardo DiCaprio does an excellent job in the lead role and the
supporting cast does not disappoint. 10 / 10 from me. I applaud you,
Christopher Nolan.
