That&#x27;s what Leonardo DiCaprio was shouting at me for months from all
those trailers and previews (there wasn&#x27;t many of them) and he was
right I wasn&#x27;t prepared for this awesome, mind-blowing experience.<br /><br />Finally I have seen the most anticipated movie of this year (for me)
and I know you are all excited for this movie so I try do describe the
movie without giving away too much of the plot. The story tells of Cobb
who is a extractor, someone who enters human minds through their dreams
he and his team create and steals valuable information from the
subject&#x27;s mind. He is a wanted fugitive in the U.S.A, which is a
problem for him, because he&#x27;s got kids there and coming back home to
them is what he most desires. During his last assignment he meets a
mysterious Japanese businessman, who doesn&#x27;t ask him of extraction but
an inception, planting an idea in someone&#x27;s mind and that is much more
complicated. So Cobb sets out to recruit a team and finish this last
job alive.<br /><br />All the actors here do an outstanding job; Leonardo Dicaprio is at his
best in this movie, Marion Cottilard does an excellent job as &#x22;The
Shade&#x22;, Ellen Page, one of the prettiest young actresses of today, is
always great. Tom Hardy plays here the character with the right bad-ass
attitude, they should offer him more roles like this.The biggest
surprise for me was Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Arthur, never seen a movie
with him he surprised me how charismatic he is and how great he pulled
off the role of Arthur.<br /><br />If you think the soundtrack from Hans Zimmer in The Dark Knight was
unbelievable then wait for this one, I have to go and call this The
Best Soundtrack of the Year.<br /><br />This movie features one of the best movie fights ever where Arthur is
fighting one of the subconscious&#x27; defenses and the gravity is always
changing. That fight is just so breathtaking and suspensive. It&#x27;s just
a like Ariadne says &#x22;It&#x27;s pure creation&#x22;.<br /><br />The movie is just so brilliant, it works on many levels. It&#x27;s
suspensive, mysterious, filled with action, the visuals are
breathtaking, there is the typical blockbuster/Nolan humor in it too.
Christopher Nolan is once again playing with the mind of the audience
and until the end you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going to happen and you don&#x27;t
even know after the end. That&#x27;s the beauty of it Nolan lets the viewer
interpret the ending by himself. Nolan made this masterpiece, this
modern day classic and it&#x27;s a one hell of a ride and it&#x27;s one hell of
mind-blower.<br /><br />If you think about it, Nolan has planted an idea in your mind which you
will be thinking about for months.
