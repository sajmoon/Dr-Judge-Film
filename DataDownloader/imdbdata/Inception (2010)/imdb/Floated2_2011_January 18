There really isn&#x27;t much to say about Inception that hasn&#x27;t been said
already. By now, its very well known and considered a really great
piece of art (to many a masterpiece). Inception is a very well written,
yet confusing action-thriller concerning reality and dreams. Before
watching the film, I had some high expectations but also some rather
lower expectations. I&#x27;ve read many positive reviews, and negative
reviews, so I finally decided to watch the film. And I was very please
and my expectations were met.<br /><br />In detail, director Christopher Nolan throws a perfect storm of stunts,
effects, locations and actors at one big idea: that it&#x27;s possible to
pilfer ideas from dreams by a process called &#x27;extraction&#x27;, which
involves hooking yourself up to a drip, falling asleep and entering the
world of the subconscious. The holy grail of this process is to reverse
it, which is &#x27;inception&#x27;, the planting of a new idea in another&#x27;s mind.
That&#x27;s the trick that experts Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Arthur
(Joseph Gordon Levitt), aided by new recruits Ariadne (Ellen Page) and
Eames (Tom Hardy), try to pull off while hopping from Tokyo to Paris to
Mombasa. They&#x27;re working for Saito (Ken Watanabe) in pursuit of
business magnate Robert (Cillian Murphy), and their motives vary, from
financial to intellectual. But DiCaprio has another driver: the memory
of his wife Mal (Marion Cottilard) is haunting him and it&#x27;s going to
take a lot of psychological spring-cleaning for him to reconnect with
that lost world. Overall, Inception is a very well made thriller and
should please many for different various reasons. If you haven&#x27;t
already seen Inception, I highly suggest watching it (on DVD or online-
