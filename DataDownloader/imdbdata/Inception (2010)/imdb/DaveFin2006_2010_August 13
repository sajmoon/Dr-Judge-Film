I thoroughly enjoyed it. Even my wife enjoyed it &#x22;: ) (to a lesser
extent) But when I considered it... rather than it being &#x22;the next
Matrix&#x22; it was more the next &#x22;Italian Job&#x22; or &#x22;Oceans 11&#x22;. <br /><br />The scene is set relatively early, the plan laid out, all that remained
was the recruitment of the right team to execute the job.<br /><br />There was enough to keep me interested, although the Sci-Fi aspect of
it did pose a few &#x22;loop-holes&#x22; for me, but they didn&#x27;t detract from the
enjoyment too much.<br /><br />I&#x27;ve only watched it once so far, on the IMAX (wow) and I look forward
to a second viewing on BluRay, hopefully to enjoy it even more... or at
least, again.<br /><br />8/10
