2010_December 9 
I saw the movie without seeing any adds or hearing anything about it. I
have always liked DiCaprio movies so I went to see this one and I was
pleasantly surprised, I thought it would be good and it turned out to
be great. My personal opinion is that this movie is worth 9/10 and I
would have thought that the average user would rate it an 8. But I
simply cannot believe anyone would rate Inception lower than 7.<br /><br />Maybe the IMDb&#x27;s average rating (and rank in top 10) is a bit high, but
I have seen a lot of reviews where people think the movie is worth 4
and rated it 1 because &#x27;they want to lower the average&#x27;. When you think
the movie is worth 4, rate it 4. The average rating is called average
for a reason, it is ridiculous to give extremely low grades just to so
the average rating matches your opinion. People who do so are missing
the whole concept.<br /><br />D.
