I went to see this movie to a movie theater based on the classification
given here(for the movie to occupy the third position had to be a good
movie), I confess I was a little afraid because the story seemed to be
too complex and without much action, kind of like Memento which is also
performed by this superb lord (Christopher Nolan), yes it is true that
I did not think Memento was a great movie.<br /><br />I Could not be more wrong, this is undoubtedly one of the best movies I
have ever seen, alongside to &#x22;Gran Torino&#x22; or &#x22;Godfather Part.I&#x22;. Yes,
it is true that this movie is a little bit complex, but is that
complexity thoroughly researched and superbly made that makes
&#x22;Inception&#x22; a great classic and eventually remembered as the best
original screenplay ever written. <br /><br />I also welcome the cast, three is particular: Di Caprio did not
surprise me because he knows what to do as anyone, Gordon-Levitt has an
interpretation just as good as in &#x22;(500) Days of Summer&#x22;, and Ellen
Page was finally able to devote herself to a great movie confirming her
potential. The rest of the cast is also to be congratulated. <br /><br />I advise the world to see this movie, even those people who do not like
science fiction, because this movie is unique, and please do not take
your eyes off the screen, as each detail is important.
