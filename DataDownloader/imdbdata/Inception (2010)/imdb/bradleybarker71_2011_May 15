Inception will become one of your favorite movies of all time. Not only
is there a creative story that you will be discussing long after the
movie is over but there are some great performances. Inception follows
a heist team who are experts in extracting information from peoples
dreams and they are given there toughest job to date INCEPTION. Nolan
has given another mind blowing movie that makes Movie goers and cinema
goers alike something to be proud of and treasurer forever. Incption
goes against everything you could ever imagine and it will blow your
mind and leave you feeling blown away and wanting to watch the movie
again and again as the ending will leave you thinking. If you like The
Dark Knight Batman Begins you&#x27;ll like this but if you love and
understand Memento this should be a piece of cake ENJOY. Inception for
me is a must see.<br /><br />A Must See!
