You&#x27;ll never get to watch such a brilliant piece of work. The first
thought that occurred to me was &#x22;Christopher Nolan is a psychic&#x22;. I
felt that he must have peeped into the dreams of at least a 100 people.<br /><br />I found the plot similar to Matrix and also to Push. Yet it is
presented with utmost care in a very intuitive but articulate manner.
After all what else can you expect from the maker of The Dark
Night,Prestige,Memento? The answer is &#x22;Something more than an Excellent
Screenplay&#x22;.<br /><br />After reading the reviews and looking at the 9.6/10 for the Premier
shows, I&#x27;ve been eagerly waiting for the official release. I grabbed a
ticket for the first show. I&#x27;d expected a movie of Level 5 (Prestige
was the best movie previously Rated 5/5) but I got a Level 7 (7/5).<br /><br />The plot of the story appears to be simple : Cobb(Di Caprio) does the
job of extracting confidential information from the business tycoons
until one day when he finds himself all alone separated from his
family. He then get an opportunity to get back most of his lost
possessions. This time his job is not to extract the information but to
insert it.<br /><br />The work of all the actors was decent and I&#x27;m still searching for a
word to describe Nolan. The best movie of the planet.<br /><br />Watch this before you die else your soul will be lingering around
theaters to get a glimpse and This is not exaggeration.
