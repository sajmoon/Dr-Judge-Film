It has received so many positive reviews because nobody dares say it
was made based on very illiterate understanding of human mind and dream
psychology. Similar to the story of the silly naked king who thought he
wore the most beautiful dress that only wise people could see, and so
no one dared say they could not see any dress on him! OK, so we use a
briefcase containing a large button and a few wires to enter anyone&#x27;s
dream and if you have an architect with you, the whole thing will be
somehow just fine, and all these details that happen there are
somebody&#x27;s projection or memory, or ... but don&#x27;t worry because someone
will tell you what they are! Not enough? OK, you will be able to use
the dream version of that briefcase machine to still move one layer
deeper, and go to the dreams of a dreaming person?! How stupid that
this get? Seeing all these positive reviews I just realize the
brilliance of the naked king with invisible clothes to stupid people. I
am not against novel concepts, Matrix was such a novel one, but
inception is a mockery of science, human mind, dream psychology, and
more! 4 stars only for the special effects.
