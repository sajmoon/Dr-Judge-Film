This is a breathtaking science fiction film to watch and its 2 hours 20
minutes sped by for me. Even if it borrowed a lot from Matrix, Orphee,
even Kane at the climax, and others, it was so confident and assured in
the depiction and dissection of its nonsense world I couldn&#x27;t help but
be very impressed. So what if the plot apparently bulges with Real
World non sequiteurs and Dream World paradoxes &#x96; as recommended to a
character in the film (and by Cocteau in Belle Et La Bete) we have to
take a leap of faith. It&#x27;s why so many people believe in a God.<br /><br />A team of mind altering thieves (Extractors) are recruited and hired by
a billionaire capitalist to plant an idea via dreams (Inception) in a
rival billionaire capitalist&#x27;s mind to break up his empire and thus
preserve profit margins. As you might or might not imagine it&#x27;s not so
straightforward, leading to a dream within a dream within a dream
within a dream within a dream and limbo &#x85; at least. The acting was
good, however the characters were basically 2D and although DeCaprio&#x27;s
was fleshed out a little more I didn&#x27;t empathise with any of them, but
the plot was the thing after all! There&#x27;s no compromise: it&#x27;s tortuous
to follow at times and relentlessly fast paced throughout &#x96; the first
10 minutes were incomprehensible to me but gradually it became as clear
as mud, until even I saw the ending coming. My modern-film-savvy
daughter was on hand to act as interpreter but we had to lean on each
other and promise a re-view next year sometime. I would add that the
actual process of putting people under was thankfully skipped over and
Michael Caine&#x27;s usual death-touches were blissfully brief.<br /><br />On first and second thoughts I recommend this as a film made in 2010
that has absolutely no swearing, no sex, not much violence, a
&#x22;realistic&#x22; amount of cgi cartoonery, but a well made engrossing
storyline instead.
