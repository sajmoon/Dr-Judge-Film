I remember when they (and Chris Nolan) used to make films about people
and their dilemma&#x27;s. The actual conflict in Inception is just an
after-thought to appease. Cobb&#x27;s issue about wanting to see his
children is so tired and played out it is almost laughable. With all
the attention that went into the dream process, maybe Nolan could have
spent a little more time with human elements of the film.<br /><br />Whether it&#x27;s a wife who killed her children or a wife who killed
herself and left children, we are tired of Leo as the grieving husband
(Inception/Shutter Island). Clearly this film was to showcase
cleverness in concept and effects. The story is a bare-bones, hackneyed
joke.<br /><br />Even the mission is a yawner. Who cares about the rich kid and his rich
dad- you don&#x27;t even get to know them so why care? None of the
relationships are below the surface so there is nothing invested in the
story.<br /><br />Movies are about relationship, conflict and story. All of these
elements are after-thoughts in INCEPTION! This is strictly a concept
film whose execution of CGI is way more special then it&#x27;s attention to
story.
