Without a doubt, Inception has stomped it&#x27;s mark as one of my new
favorite films of all time. With it&#x27;s motion swaying brass tones
roaring underneath a drastically different style of architectural
approach in film, you&#x27;re left in awe of it&#x27;s mostly original story and
roundabout perfection as an entire film. Much in vein of The Matrix,
it&#x27;s redefined a decade with a new genre, in that you&#x27;ve never seen
something as astounding and different as Inception before. Inception
sends the viewer deep into the human mind and leaves you there for most
of the film to uncover and discover a world to be decoded by the films
characters and you as the viewer.<br /><br />-SiilentMiike (SiilentMiike.com)
