Not since The Matrix has a blockbuster blown audiences&#x27; minds like this
film. The plot, storyline, dialogue, cast, special effects,
score/soundtrack, and cinematography are nothing short of amazing. This
is the movie in which Gordon-Levitt went from promising young actor to
bona fide star; his spinning hallway fight scene was truly awesome, and
he did it himself (not a stuntman). Page went from cute and clever girl
to confident, intelligent, and sexy young lady. DiCaprio was truly
outstanding, as usual. Tom Hardy was smooth, precise, and imposing&#x85;he
could be the next Bond; can&#x27;t wait to see him play Bane in The Dark
Knight Rises. Watanabe exuded confidence as a corporate general who
practiced the art of war by a strict code of discipline and honor.
Cillian Murphy convincingly wore years of rejection from his father on
his face. And Marion Cotillard was a passionate, desperate, angry,
scary, vulnerable, loving, confused, helpless, and pretty human wraith&#x85;
all at the same time. Well done.<br /><br />I rated it a Theater movie because I went to see it in the theater&#x85;
twice. It&#x27;s poetic that the recurring theme throughout this movie is
mazes &#x26; puzzles&#x85;and this movie is one big puzzle itself&#x85;it&#x27;s a puzzle
that the characters must navigate, but also one that the viewer must
solve in order to fully understand. After watching the film once, I was
dumbfounded by what I had just seen&#x85;it was so creative, so different,
so complex, that I wasn&#x27;t sure if it all made sense, but I loved the
ride. The second time through, I tried to solve the puzzle, but it
seemed as if some pieces still weren&#x27;t fitting right. At that point, it
seemed to me that Nolan simply had not closed some loops. I started to
feel that maybe Matt Stone and Trey Parker were right when they created
that South Park episode suggesting that this movie was not as smart as
it pretended to be&#x85;I thought that maybe the extremely intelligent
puzzle posed by the film was really just a paradox, like Penrose
stairs, created to distract the viewers for a finite amount of time
while the producers took their money and left them dazzled by great
special effects and an all-star cast (sound familiar?). But, like many
a good puzzle, you walk away from it for a while, come back to it, and
the answer you were looking for was right there, in plain sight. By the
third time I watched this movie, I was satisfied that Nolan had not cut
across the lines to solve his own carefully constructed maze&#x85;no, this
maze was a masterpiece&#x85;one of my favorite all-time movies ever.
