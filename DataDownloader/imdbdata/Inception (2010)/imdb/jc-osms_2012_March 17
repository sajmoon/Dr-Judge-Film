I actually didn&#x27;t &#x22;get&#x22; some of Christopher Nolan&#x27;s previous movies,
like &#x22;Identity&#x22; or &#x22;The Prestige&#x22; and so was wary of the hype
surrounding this blockbuster of his. I&#x27;m glad to say that I finally got
it this time as this is a spectacular sci-fi thriller with more levels
than the Empire State Building, demanding, but rewarding the viewer&#x27;s
full attention throughout.<br /><br />It really impresses in every way possible, the imagination which fires
the story, the lucidity with which it&#x27;s complexity is brought to the
screen, the pacing which is relentless throughout, but never wearing
and the circular resolution of the story by the end sequence.<br /><br />Yes there are holes in the plot, (like how did Fischer come to be ready
for the team&#x27;s attempt to hijack his memory?) plus the motivation for
the elaborateness of the team&#x27;s plan doesn&#x27;t convince as it should, but
this is an instance of &#x22;trust the teller, not the tale&#x22; as, futurist
elements part, it rattles along, fuelled by Hans Zimmer&#x27;s pounding
background music.<br /><br />The acting is uniformly good, Di Caprio leading his assorted
&#x22;dream-busters&#x22; with aplomb, the acting by all executed with
razor-sharp timing and conviction, which the story demands. The
cinematography and C-Gen SFX are eye-popping, particularly Cobb&#x27;s first
dream-walk with Ariadne, the weightless fight-scene, the train&#x27;s
appearance in city centre traffic and much much more.<br /><br />This film unquestionably is Nolan&#x27;s best and raises the bar for
tech-thrillers in the modern age.<br /><br />It&#x27;s one dream you won&#x27;t want to end.
