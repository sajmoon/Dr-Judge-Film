This film has been seriously hyped - like many other viewers, I
expected much more than it delivered. Almost everyone has had that
experience of being disappointed by a film that you have been really
looking forward to - this was a prime example. First of all the acting
- Keanu Reeves and Joseph Gordon-Levitt - separated at birth, and
neither can act at all. I liked Ellen Page very much in Juno, but she
was sadly miscast in this role. Not that any actress could have made
sense out of her character - she was at random times a newbie, who
needed the basics explained, and/or an authority on how the whole thing
worked. The plot was filled with these messy holes, but it wasn&#x27;t
entirely negative - some of the effects were fun, and DiCaprio is
always good, as was most of his supporting cast. On the whole, worth
seeing, just don&#x27;t expect it to be the best film you ever saw.
