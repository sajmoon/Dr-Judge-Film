5 minutes in the theater &#x26; I knew right away that it was gonna be one
kick-ass ride &#x26; I was right. All I could right now is go on &#x26; on about
this movie &#x26; wouldn&#x27;t stop. I request, those of you haven&#x27;t see
it..Please go watch it in THEATER if it&#x27;s still running in a theater
near you.<br /><br />There is not a single scene in a movie that makes you feel that it
should not have been there. Director Nolan has one again proved that
intelligent cinema can win audience over it&#x27;s complexity yet sincerity
towards the concept.<br /><br />Best Sci-fi movie I have seen till date.
