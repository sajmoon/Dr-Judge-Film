Im sort of sick of people saying this movie is &#x22;confusing&#x22; or has &#x22;many
twists&#x22;. it doesn&#x27;t. the concept is extremely simple. go inside a dream
and keep dreaming in dreams until u reach a point where the victim is
vulnerable enough for inception (the act of planting an idea). thats
it, its that easy. now that thats covered, the movie is fresh in the
sense that well everything occurs in a dream so u can do anything u
want without essentially dealing with real life consequences. this is
both the good part and the bad part of the movie. Christopher Nolan is
a clever man. the concept of a state of mind where reality seems to be
yet with no real life consequences is extremely appealing to humans
which may distract many from the flaws in the movie. Christopher new
that, and its also what he wanted. But he also new that some people had
working brains and could see past this illusion, so he had to have an
end game, a consequence at some point, and thats when he put in the
FAIL of the movie. it was then said that if u die in a dream under
sedation u will stay locked in a prison dream world where u cant escape
all because u died. he called this limbo. let us remember that in a
dream we are imagining. so right now if i took an ambien and imagine
jumping off a cliff, i would be stuck in a parallel universe for 100
years. there&#x27;s a difference between sci-fi and ridiculous, and then
there&#x27;s inception. whats even more annoying is that half of the movie
is spent trying to make this whole concept seem real. overall very
average movie that stumbles over itself over and over until we perceive
these stumblings as an innovative twist and deem this average movie
genius.
