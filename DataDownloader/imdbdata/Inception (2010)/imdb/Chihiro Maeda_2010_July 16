After watching the midnight premiere, my friends and I came up with a
theory behind Christopher Nolan and his Inception movie. While he was
making Inception Christopher Nolan needed more funding therefore he
decided to make the Dark Knight. Sadly Heath Ledger passed away but his
death brought more fame and fortune than Nolan expected. He was
planning on reusing ALL actors in the Dark Knight but Christian Baile
went on a drama-queen rampage on set against the lighting director
causing Nolan to lean towards DiCaprio as his lead. (This came about
because Nolan happened to be sipping tea with Scorsese one lovely
evening, discussing Shutter Island and how fantastically adorable
DiCaprio was in thrillers.) The Dark Knight was at best a side project
because what Director Christopher Nolan REALLY had in mind was to F***
with our sense of reality through HIS thriller, Inception.<br /><br />No movie has ever caused me physical pain except this one. i was
cringing from suspense. Every muscle in my body ached. my lungs were
collapsed and when i tried to stand up after the credits i just
couldn&#x27;t. i just could not BREATHE. my eyes still sting. why? because
the entire movie, my eyes were GLUED to the screen and i probably
blinked, oh lets say, ZERO times. driving back from the theater, i lost
my voice raving about the movie with my friends. and Hans Zimmer? i
made my own Hollywood Star for him in the backyard. the grass spell out
his name. i loved this movie. Pick and pull at it all you want, it was
fantastic.
