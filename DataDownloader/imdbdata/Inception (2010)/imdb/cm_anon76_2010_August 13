What is Inception? It&#x27;s a sci-fi movie with a little bit of a moral to
it. But it&#x27;s mostly just sci-fi. It has a plot, but the plot takes over
an hour just to present itself. And it has a good ending, which takes
place about 1 and 1/2 hours after that. In between those times you&#x27;ll
be bombarded with so much sci-fi that you&#x27;ll think you&#x27;re in a college
class. You won&#x27;t be able to see the forest through the trees. This is a
bland movie, lacking a gravitas and a human element. Stylistically it
was interesting. It had kind of a film-noir feel to it. But that was
grossly outweighed by the enormous amount of sci-fi. It was also kind
of disturbing. The only character I thought was likable was the son of
a captain of industry. It seems like most of the characters didn&#x27;t even
like each other, and those that did were in unhealthy, and even sick
relationships. They say the love you get is equal to the love you give.
There&#x27;s not much love in this film, except for the captain of
industry&#x27;s love for his father. Many of the characters don&#x27;t even
respect each other. I was so bored I wanted to walk out early. It was a
good ending, but I&#x27;m just not a huge sci-fi geek.
