Think Vanilla Sky meets Matrix meets The 13th Floor meets Shutter
Island and you have Inception. The cast is fantastic and Nolan does a
good job weaving the story into a complex tapestry. Page and Cottilard
are counter-balances to the struggles of DiCaprio&#x27;s character. Leonardo
is brilliant in picking movies in which to act in. The concept of
creating a dream world is great, though not original (what is
nowadays). A dream within a dream within a dream, with adjusted time
within each is a interesting slant of the concept. The movie started
off a little slow, but once into the plot, it took off like a rocket.
Without giving away the ending; it is the appropriate way to end this
story. Though I was beginning to see it happen before it ended. What is
real?
