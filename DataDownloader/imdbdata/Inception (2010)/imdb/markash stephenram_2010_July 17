as my summary line suggests, one cannot but stand in awe at the film
and its maker. Inception is something unbelievable. The claps , the
whistles,shouts of &#x22; BRILLIANT&#x22;, &#x22;AMAZING&#x22; etc. and exclamatory
swearings out of shocks reverbarate in the theater, I was still
sitting, wondering how on earth did Christopher Nolan conceive and
deliver this movie. Kudos to Warner Bros for imposing faith on Nolan
and give us this movie or rather a classic . From a country from where
i hail, its a rarity to see such films.. not that i blame movies from
my country, its just that the makers and the mass people/audience
support no-logic, larger than life commercial films. there are some
excellent movies made, but the creative liberty is not available here.
Hope people from my place , watch this movie and that wannabe future
film makers come out with out-of- the box concepts like this.<br /><br />sheer class . full marks to Nolan&#x27;s audacity.<br /><br />Following is a master-piece. Memento re-defined all rules. Insomnia
showed his class. Batman begins showed his versatility. Prestige showed
why he is one of the best . The Dark Knight showed He is the best .
Through Inception , he has surpassed himself .<br /><br />Legendary stuff .
