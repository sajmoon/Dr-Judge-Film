When Inception came out in the Summer of 2010, everyone made a big deal
about it. I just rented Inception and I can&#x27;t understand what all the
hoopla was about. It&#x27;s essentially a cheap copy of The Matrix which
came out 11 years before in 1999. Someone at the rental store said he
had a hard time staying awake while he saw it. The same thing happened
to me which is incredibly ironic since Inception involves sleeping. It
was boring and at over 2 hours long I was wondering if I should speed
up the playback to 1.2x speed. It was so boring that I took a break and
saw Attack of the Puppet People (1958) which was actually more
interesting! Then I returned to Inception and saw the second half.<br /><br />I can&#x27;t understand how Inception managed to make $300M. It must have
been marketing and hype orchestrated by the studios. I am so glad I
only paid $1.25 to see this boring tripe. If you haven&#x27;t already seen
the original or haven&#x27;t seen it for a few years, rent The Matrix. It&#x27;s
far better.<br /><br />5 out of 10 stars
