but it was good. It wasn&#x27;t quite as good as I had hoped, but good.
Surprisingly it was pretty easy to follow as well, considering
everything that was going on. I think the best part of this movie was
the shear amount of imagination that went into both the plot and the
cinematography/special effects. The diversity of the cast added to the
multi-dimensional nature of the movie, and everyone played their part
well. That said, there really wasn&#x27;t a lot of emotional involvement in
the story though I think they did try. It just wasn&#x27;t that kind of
movie. Lots of action, great cgi and special effects, explosions, car
chases, shoot outs, impregnable fortresses guarded by henchmen,
basically everything (well most everything) a guy wants in a movie.
