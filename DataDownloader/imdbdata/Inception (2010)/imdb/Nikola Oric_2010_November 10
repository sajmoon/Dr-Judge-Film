2010_November 10 
It&#x27;s 2010, and the world of cinema excitements exists for almost a
century now. The first 20-30 years and their films we&#x27;re actually the
pioneers of the movie art, experimenting what we can and can not do.
Going from the 40&#x27;s right to the middle of the 90&#x27;s we&#x27;ve experienced
originality, wittiness, amazing stories and many more. Nowadays, the
movies suffer from repetition, shallowness and dullness. So, most of
the movies that count nowadays are remakes (The Karate Kid for exp),
and even they are mostly pretty simple and same as the originals
before. And, just when a movie comes out you hope that will be
something, it fails, which makes you disappointed and sad. Nolan
introduced himself to the world of fantastic movies with Memento,
continued with Batman Begins and impressed with the Dark Knight. With
Inception- he amazed us. Fantastic production is one of the things that
make this movie great. Nolan fantastically used one of nowadays
greatest actors, like Leonardo DiCaprio, who is absolutely amazing in
Shutter Island, the young Joseph Gordon Levitt, who has grown into a
seriously talented actor, the unique charm of the young Ellen Page etc.
All of them make Inception and it&#x27;s story, action, tension, plot,
atmosphere- amazing. Fantastic. Unbelievable. Inception is definitely
the movie of the year, and you can only be a moron or a masochist to
miss this spectacle. Absolutely amazing. 10/10
