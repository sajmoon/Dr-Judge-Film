This movie is the best movie I have ever seen. I am an ardent fan of
DiCaprio and Chris Nolan so don&#x27;t think I am over boosting. Christopher
Nolan is one of the most intelligent directors. Most of the stories he
chooses have a an intricate plot. The same is Inception but the best
part is by the time the movie ends you will be confident enough that u
understood the story. He directs everything so confidently and in this
movie all the technology he has utilized in the fights and the style in
which they were displayed were flawless. The movie is perfect to the
very lowest level of detail. I have been following this one since the
first trailer, which came in 2009. I was so confident that its gonna
rule the box office and it is. <br /><br />A visual treat for everyone who watches the movie. Its a perfect combo.
Christopher Nolan&#x27;s two default characters ( Michael Caine, Cillian
Murphy) had their perfect balance in the movie. For a star like
DiCaprio whose skill and potential are immense, a role like this one is
perfect. He is the cynosure of the movie. Ellen Page,Levitt and hardy
did their job. Overall review I felt is Its a movie of this generation.
Hats off of to Christopher Nolan and DiCaprio..<br /><br />I had a dream in my upper secondary which was a one similar to this one
i always thought of dreams and kind of intruding into dreams when I
listen to my pals dreams. This movie was a similar to my thought. This
is one of the main reasons why I was very keen to watch this movie. And
I am completely convinced by the imagination and plot of this movie and
the grand scale in which the movie was made.<br /><br />I have to believe in the fact that the characters which Christopher
Nolan creates in his movies like the Joker in the dark knight and
Mr.Cobb in this one will be remembered forever by movie lovers.<br /><br />Technically this movie has it own credentials. The background scores by
Hans Zimmer are mind blowing. I keep listening to them at my leisure.
Richard King the sound designer for Inception had to really work hard
to make everything feel and sound real.I read one of his interviews and
he had expressed in words the amount of hard work he had to do for this
kind of movie.<br /><br />Inception is Awesome. and the imagination of Chris Nolan is
unbelievable.....U rock totally..
