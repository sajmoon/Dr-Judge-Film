I cannot say enough good about this movie. There are so many excellent
forces that made this movie that superb piece of art that it is. <br /><br />First, of course, is Nolan&#x27;s direction. There is some seriously
enlightened direction going on here. It starts off a bit slow (as most
of his movies do), but he shortly throws it into overdrive. Before
long, the movie is roaring past you. It&#x27;s exhilarating, simply put.<br /><br />Nolan&#x27;s writing is also top notch. The dialogue is refreshingly real,
sharp, and coherent. In the beginning, viewers might find themselves a
bit lost (don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s intentional), but Nolan slowly exposes
INCEPTION&#x27;s secrets. The plot direction carries this movie from being a
simple heist movie (in the same vein as, say, OCEAN&#x27;S 11) to an
emotional, thoughtful, intelligent, and utterly astounding thriller. If
Nolan doesn&#x27;t receive a directing or writing Oscar for this movie, then
there is something seriously wrong the Academy.<br /><br />Also worth mentioning are the visual effects and stunts. The VFX are
seamless. Even in the film&#x27;s most visually intense moments, it&#x27;s not
entirely evident that Nolan is using CGI. Of particular mention is a
fight scene that takes place in a unstable-gravity hotel hallway. As
the actors twist and writhe all over a room where gravity is in flux,
the viewer is left dumbfounded by the surprising realism of the scene.
There&#x27;s no other way to say this: INCEPTION looks great.<br /><br />Finally, we come to the acting. If anything could steal the spotlight
from Nolan&#x27;s directing and writing, it would certainly be the efforts
put forth by the cast. Overall, the cast has impeccable chemistry.
Everyone plays together so well. - Of course, Leonardo Dicaprio was
solid. The role isn&#x27;t much of a deviation for him, but he plays it
well. His most emotionally intense moments hit hard and his character
is developed very well. He deftly leads a relatively-unknown, but
unbelievably-talented cast. There isn&#x27;t that much &#x22;star power&#x22; in this
movie, but the caliber of the acting is superb. - Marillon Cotillard
was unbelievable. Her role is arguably the film&#x27;s most versatile and
she expertly glides through each aspect of her character. She&#x27;s a very
talented actress who works so well with Dicaprio. Their relationship is
one of the emotional high-points of the movie and that is thanks
entirely to each actors&#x27; powerful contributions to the heartbreaking
reality of the relationship. - Ellen Page did a great job in her
supporting role, bringing some of her signature wit into it. She has a
very big on screen presence and she fits in surprisingly well with the
mostly-male main cast. - Joseph Gordon Levitt and Tom Hardy stole the
show, in my opinion. They each play two very well-crafted characters
extremely well. Levitt plays a resourceful, no-nonsense point man that
wonderfully counters Dicaprio&#x27;s somewhat-unstable character. Hardy
plays a charismatic thief that goes from devious trickster to
full-blown action hero. These guys have some seriously impressive
acting chops and it was truly a delight to watch their performances. -
Cillian Murphy, like Dicaprio, is mostly sticking to a role that he
knows, which is not a bad thing. Murphy is a talented actor, which is
readily apparent in his last big scene in the movie (one of the movie&#x27;s
most emotional moments). - Ken Watanabe and Dileep Rao also add a lot
to the overall chemistry of the ensemble. Their presence, though not as
major as some of the other characters, definitely help solidify the
ensemble&#x27;s power.<br /><br />INCEPTION will stand the test of time as one of the great American
films. Nolan is a superb director and cunning writer who has assembled
an elite group of actors to create a visually stunning, thrilling
adventure. You&#x27;d be crazy to not want to go along for the ride.
