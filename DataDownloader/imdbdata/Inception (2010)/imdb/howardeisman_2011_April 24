I have given this one star because the high rating this movie had is
out of all proportion. There are myriads of far better films with lower
scores. Let&#x27;s get this score down.<br /><br />I have the impression that this movie started with a script which had a
couple of scenes in the middle, and it was then written further to
extend it to a beginning and an end. The mystery is why anyone bothered
to try to have a coherent script in the first place. Plot? we don&#x27;t
need no stinkin plot. The basic idea of such movies is to show stunning
visual and auditory effects, have characters hurtling along, mouthing
dialog not meant to be coherent or even perceptible. Show em the
technology, wind the characters up and get them moving-fast! Have
Whoosh, whoosh, bam, bang sound effects and music to match, get a name
star, and advertise the predictable and unchallenging goop as a
transcendental experience.<br /><br />This one was interesting in places because of the visual tricks.
Otherwise, I had trouble following it at times, as much because I
couldn&#x27;t care less about what was a dream or reality, whose dream we
were in, or why this or that was happening. Explanations of the
arbitrary dream rules (excuses to do various things) were the most
transparent gobble-de-gook imaginable.<br /><br />Nothing in here had a dream like quality. The dream excuse was a
gimmick to do things like play with gravity, time, etc.<br /><br />It is just another mindless action movie, just longer and with fancy
justification. As such it is not bad-but not good.
