Since I first saw previews for Inception I was excited about it, but I
tried to keep my expectations in check. I was worried I&#x27;d develop
unreasonable hopes that would spoil a decent movie. As it turns out, I
need not have worried.<br /><br />The film is confusing at times, to the point where the group I saw the
film with thought we had uncovered plot holes, only to close them off
one by one over the course of almost an hour of discussion. I wouldn&#x27;t
have it any other way. The mechanics of shared dreaming in the movie
can be somewhat complex, but they are all established in advance and
remain consistent. This is very important for good science fiction, and
Inception is that. Parts of it do not seem physically or
psychologically plausible of course, but it&#x27;s much easier to suspend
your disbelief when the story follows its own rules.<br /><br />The plot is fascinating, thrilling, and emotional. The ending is
exactly as ambiguous as it should be, and although some people are
already arguing about what Christopher Nolan *really* had in mind, I
firmly believe that he has essentially given us two stories, and that
we are meant to decide which one we prefer. Whichever way you lean,
it&#x27;s a damn good film. If you&#x27;ll excuse me, I&#x27;m going to go watch it
again.
