Great ideas grow like a cancer. Sometimes you never really know where
they come from.<br /><br />Chris Nolan has never really had a totally original idea. Like
Tarantino, he knows other movies so well, their ideas creep into his
work, either intentionally or not. While my words on originality may
come as inflammatory, my feeling toward his talent, and films is quite
the opposite. He&#x27;s good - real good. But he isn&#x27;t original. Nobody is.
This is the 21st century folks and its all been done. It is the way
he&#x27;s showing us these familiar things, that keeps us coming back.<br /><br />Except for Di Caprio, who never really convinces as a brooding
widower/father, the rest of the band is perfect. Not that any of them
are actually interesting, the plot is the real character in Inception.
Hans Zimmers score is majestic and hugely epic and Wally Pfister&#x27;s
familiar clean visuals make it easy on the eyes.<br /><br />Much like a new roller-coaster at 6 Flags, Inception is a ride we&#x27;ve
been on on before. Dreams, reality and all that jazz, but this one has
a deeper dose of rabbit hole. We have a heist film set in the frame of
corporate psychological espionage - whatever the hell that is.<br /><br />We get Matrix style pseudo reality and weightless gun fights. We get
The Game and Total Recall style onion layers. We get the old man in the
bedroom of cubist proportions from the Kubrick 2001 finale. Maybe one
too many James Bond ski battles. And I&#x27;m just getting warmed up. The
wife story rings hollow - in fact, it&#x27;s downright boring. Exposition
goes in circles and we never do get enough Watanabe Ken. But it&#x27;s that
layered time of the tiered dreams that makes this one go boom. The
elevator that can&#x27;t drop and that van that just falls forever with the
cameras over cranking at 150 frames per second or more. But we don&#x27;t
want it to hit the water. Go deeper Cobb, cause I don&#x27;t want to get off
this one yet. <br /><br />The final joke with the unending spinner? This is Nolan&#x27;s dream, not
Cobb&#x27;s.<br /><br />It&#x27;s not visionary, it&#x27;s not original, but just like the meandering
Dark Knight or the wretched nonsense of the Prestige, or the titanic
plot holes of Memento, Inception is a rabbit hole that owns
you&#xA0;til&#xA0;it&#x27;s over. This ain&#x27;t art or philosophy to ride to the top.
It&#x27;s just one great kick all the way down.<br /><br />8/10
