My brother has this film in his top ten. Most people I spoke to about
this film had it in their top tens. IMDb, at the time, had it as the
third greatest film on the website with a score of 9.1. Naturally, I
was impressed by this, so I did what I haven&#x27;t done in years, and
actually went to the cinema.<br /><br />When I left, my wife and I agreed with one another that although the
film was original and thought-provoking, it was by no means the film of
the decade, or even in our top twenty.<br /><br />Now comes the point where people tell me that I didn&#x27;t &#x22;get&#x22; the film.
Don&#x27;t worry - I got every single thing about it, but here is where the
problem lies, for me, at least: When I pay eight pounds for myself,
eight pounds for my wife, and a whole lot more for food, drinks and
fuel money to get there, I like being entertained. In this case, I
wasn&#x27;t. It was like I had spent all that money, only to be handed a
thousand-piece jigsaw and told I had what seemed like four hours to
figure it out.<br /><br />Ellen Page didn&#x27;t even get her knockers out once, too. I was gutted.
