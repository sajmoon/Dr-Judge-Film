There is an exercise that many actors use to help them develop their
characters. They write autobiographies as their characters to give
themselves a history/family/emotional base. No one in &#x22;Inception&#x22; had
any discernible backstory. It was as if each character dropped out of
the sky but no reason was given for the way s/he dealt with situations.
I also had no idea why or how each of the characters came to the
profession of &#x22;extraction&#x22; - what motivated them or interested them in
being an extractor. Visually, the movie was fun. I did have some
problem understanding some lines that were swallowed (Mr. Watanabe
seemed to be the prime offender) and the interminable snow scene should
have lost 15 minutes. However, special effects do no make up for lack
of character development. Not caring whether a character lives or dies
does not an engaging movie make.
