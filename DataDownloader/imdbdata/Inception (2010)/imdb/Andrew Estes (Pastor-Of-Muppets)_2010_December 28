Ever since he spun the &#x22;Batman&#x22; franchise on its head half a decade
ago, there&#x27;s been an increasingly significant level of quality expected
from writer/director Christopher Nolan. If his latest creation is any
indication, Nolan sure knows how to execute a brilliant idea even when
under the most intense of pressure. His latest affair, the mind-bending
&#x22;Inception,&#x22; stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a thief who extracts thoughts
and ideas from people by entering their dreams. When a job goes wrong,
he is offered a chance at redemption. This time he has to introduce an
idea into the mind of a subject rather than steal it away. It&#x27;s an easy
enough task, right? Wrong. As he soon finds out, plunging into the
depths of uncharted waters is especially tricky when carrying your own
personal baggage. To quote Arnold Schwarzenegger in &#x22;Total Recall&#x22;:
&#x22;It&#x27;s the best mind**** yet!&#x22; <br /><br />&#x22;Inception&#x22; boasts an impressive cast. DiCaprio aside, we are treated
to some of the finest young talent Hollywood has to offer by way of
Ellen Page, Cilian Murphy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The actors &#x96; while
excellent in their roles &#x96; are but a pawn in Nolan&#x27;s game. Fact of the
matter is he could have cast a group of no-names and the film would
still be as great as it is. The true star of the film is not only the
insanely well-crafted script which will have you second-guessing
yourself at every turn, but the stunning visuals that accompany it.
Watching this movie is like stepping into an alternate universe where
anything you could imagine is possible. Nolan asks us to suspend
disbelief as we follow the film&#x27;s characters through layers of dreams.
Because the script is water-tight and the visuals so flawless, we are
fooled easily enough. Like children, we believe whole-heartedly in what
we see unfold before us even if we aren&#x27;t quite sure of how it all
works.<br /><br />While Nolan has had a pretty consistent track-record thus far, it still
comes as a shock that &#x22;Inception&#x22; is as good as it is. The term is
thrown around loosely all too often, but the film is a heavy contender
for best film of the year. More than that, though, this is Nolan&#x27;s
masterpiece. The director&#x27;s perfectionist streak shows through in a
film that truly has no flaws. It may take a few viewings to completely
wrap your head around, but there is not an inch of celluloid wasted.
There is not a line uttered without importance and not a special effect
that looks artificial. To step into the world of &#x22;Inception&#x22; is to step
into another dimension where films can still be magical and blow the
minds of even the most jaded of movie-goers. A dream come true indeed.<br /><br />Oh, and was I the only one expecting to hear Tom Petty&#x27;s &#x22;Free Fallin&#x27;&#x22;
during the scenes where the van falls off the bridge? I hope not.
