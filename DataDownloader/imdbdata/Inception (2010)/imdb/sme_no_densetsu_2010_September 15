If I were to venture the opinion that Christopher Nolan has had the
best track record among directors in the past decade there are probably
many who would agree with me. Fresh off the huge success of &#x22;The Dark
Knight&#x22;, Nolan&#x27;s latest project was hotly anticipated and, in my
opinion, has proved to be his best effort yet.<br /><br />&#x22;Inception&#x22; takes place in a world where individuals have access to
technology which allows them to enter into the dreams of others. The
film focuses on a crack team of &#x27;dream thieves&#x27; who specialize in
extraction; that is, stealing the valuable secrets of others. However,
for their latest job they&#x27;ve been tasked with the highly difficult, if
not impossible, job of implanting an idea in someone&#x27;s subconscious.<br /><br />If I had to describe the film in a couple of words I&#x27;d call it a
cerebral thriller. Nolan&#x27;s script is intricate to say the least but the
plot is also full of action. Accordingly, I&#x27;d advise you to pay close
attention or the &#x27;dream within a dream&#x27; layering will have you lost in
no time.<br /><br />The cast is a good one, with the always dependable Leonardo DiCaprio
leading the way. Marion Cotillard also delivers a fine performance as
the subconscious version of DiCaprio&#x27;s deceased wife. In support, the
film features some alumni from previous Nolan films (Cillian Murphy,
Ken Watanabe &#x26; Michael Caine) along with some new faces (Ellen Page,
Joseph Gordon-Levitt &#x26; Tom Berenger).<br /><br />Nolan&#x27;s direction is ably handled, as usual, even if it isn&#x27;t as
accomplished as his writing. Similarly, the Hans Zimmer score serves
its purpose but isn&#x27;t especially noteworthy. The special effects, while
not awe-inspiring, are uniformly effective.<br /><br />I&#x27;ll admit that I thought that &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22; was highly overrated
and hampered by its PG-13 rating. This film, on the other hand, rises
above the usual expectations for a summer blockbuster and has the
audacity to challenge the audience. I can only hope that others follow
suit.
