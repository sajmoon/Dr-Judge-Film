The first movie that I saw of this guy was Memento and I was so much
thrilled that I couldn&#x27;t sleep the whole night and then Batman revival
follows through Batman Begins.... and I was wondering how can one get
lucky all the time... but he again proved me wrong with Prestige. Then
again i felt that this would be last.... but Dark Knight as the world
knows overshadowed everything that the world had seen so far... And I
said to myself wait a minute... this seems to be too much.... too good
to be true... so I went to see Inception in fear mingled with
excitement that this has to be a flop.. but my heart wanted it to be a
good movie...and oh! my dear I couldn&#x27;t believe what I saw... what I
heard.. and what I experienced... and was so tremendously elevated by
this supreme intelligent movie that i pinched myself to check if I&#x27;m in
a real world or a dream world.... Simply the most magnificent movie of
his era.. and the best was not the way Christopher Nolan thought....
but the way he could somehow managed to show in form of cinema... Truly
a super class act... a Masterpiece.... Hats off to Nolan and brilliant
acting by Leonardo-de-Caprio, Ellen Page and other supporting
folks.....
