Let me start off by saying that Christopher Nolan has outdone himself
once again. As if The Dark Knight wasn&#x27;t enough for us to get excited
over, Inception in my opinion blows it all out of proportion in the
best way ever.<br /><br />Inception creates wide appeal to all types of Movie lovers. The great
puzzling moments at the very start of the film which made everyone at
the Cinema go &#x22;WTF?&#x22; and then at the end shout &#x22;OMG&#x22;. It&#x27;s the perfect
film to not only just watch but to explain to all those people that
have dreams every night that this might actually be possible to do in
the near future? But all jokes aside Inception combines superb acting
from the whole cast and dare I say Ellen Page...actually didn&#x27;t let
herself down one bit in the entire duration of the film, Leo just
amazes me every time, his acting from the early years of Titanic to
this present day have got to such a high standard you forget he&#x27;s even
acting! The Narrative of the film is simple yet effective. why would
you need a complex narrative when the idea and concept of the film are
already complex enough? Without going into spoilers the whole film was
a absolute masterpiece, combining great specialFX with breath taking
acting, I assume you already realise that this film is in my top 10
without thinking twice.<br /><br />If your still not convinced then head down to your local Cinema, and
ask for a refund after you&#x27;ve seen it, I guarantee the movie usher will
laugh in hysterics at your joke, because I don&#x27;t know a single person
who doesn&#x27;t like this film.<br /><br />10/10
