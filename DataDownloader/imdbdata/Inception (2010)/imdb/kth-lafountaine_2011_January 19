Christopher Nolan has always been well known for his hard to grasp
films. From Memento to The Dark Knight, his films make you think about
the characters and the story they are going through. Inception is no
different. It is definitely a movie that makes you think, but plot is
amazing. I was very angry when it did not win Best Picture at the
Golden Globes. Many people say that Inception is insanely overrated,
but I think it is insanely underrated. Many people cannot grasp the
work it takes to put together a film of this caliber. Overall,
Inception had it all, from great acting to a well written script.
Anyone who is anyone should go see this film. Don&#x27;t believe the Golden
Globes! This is the best film of 2010!
