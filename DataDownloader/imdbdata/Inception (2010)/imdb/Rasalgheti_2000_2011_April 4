incredible that a meaningless mess, boring and almost pornographic
movie as the black swan has had such visibility in the delivery of the
prize of the Academy of Cinematographic Arts and Sciences this year
2011, and this gem, this masterpiece of cinema has not even mentioned,
there really is something terribly wrong but not only with the academy
but also with the public, which prefers to see the same remake 10.000
times! but a cool story, intelligent, versatile, and ambitious,no, this
story has no acceptance! I am also agree that Christopher Nolan
deserves to be best director, and this movie deserves the prize of best
movie of the year, there are times that I also want the reality was a
dream!.
