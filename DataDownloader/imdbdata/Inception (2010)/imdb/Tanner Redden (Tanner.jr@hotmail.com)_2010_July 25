If you have plan on seeing Christopher Nolan&#x27;s mind-bending new movie,
you should do so quickly, because this is sure to be the type of movie
that has people standing around at the local party talking about for
months and even years to come. A beautiful masterpiece.<br /><br />Let me start out by saying that Inception is one of the best movies I
have seen this year, and ranks among the best movies I have ever seen.
I am not biast towards any director and was a little worried about this
although I love Nolans work with deep sci-fi fascination which might
make you think that I would be predisposed to liking this movie anyway.
Nolan&#x27;s sci-fi slanted, Beautiful, mind-blowing film is certain to be
the type of movie that won&#x27;t be easily defined, and will appeal to fans
of any genre. Years from now, video stores (assuming there are any
video stores left years from now) will likely have to think long and
hard about whether to label this movie as sci-fi, action, or even drama
before assigning it a place on the shelves. It is a movie that defies
easy analysis, but still manages to entertain.<br /><br />Inception is Nolan&#x27;s reward for the success of the Batman films.
Without the critical and commercial success of his previous
blockbusters, it is hard to imagine a studio shelling out the kind of
money that Warner Bros. handed over to Nolan for what is essentially a
passion project- roughly $160 million. By comparison, 2008&#x27;s The Dark
Knight cost $185 million and it was a tested franchise with massive
buzz even before the script was finished. Inception is a different kind
of animal.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan has wowed us all again and as I am only 16 and am
pleased to know that I will have the amazing privilege of seeing his
work in years to come. this mindblowing, action packed thriller has
everyone on the end of their seats. I have already seen it three times
in the four days it has been out and while some will be screaming at
the ending others will agree it is really part of the true beauty of
the film and what Christopher Nolan has created down to the slightest
detail is a masterpiece. Well done Chrsitopher Nolan you have wowed us
all once again.
