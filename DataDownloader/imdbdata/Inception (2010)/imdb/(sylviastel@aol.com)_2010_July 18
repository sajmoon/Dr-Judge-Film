The whole concept of Inception is about planting ideas in the
subconscious of another&#x27;s mind. Christopher Nolan wrote, directed, and
produced this film which has an impressive array of special effects,
sequences, and issues about time. What is five minutes of dreaming can
be an hour in the dream-state? Whatever it is, the cast is quite
brilliant. Poor Sir Michael Caine who is not used enough along with
Peter Postlethwaite OBE who is on for just as much. They are both great
actors. The cast includes Oscar nominee Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph
Gordon-Leavitt, Ellen Page, Ken Watanbe, Marion Cotillard, and Cillian
Murphy. The cast is first rate as well as the special and visual
effects. There is a lot going on here and I was disappointed to learn
Fischer&#x27;s secret but I won&#x27;t spoil it for you. The plot is more
corporate espionage. Anyway, everybody in the dream game is hooked up
by wires to the same machine of some kind. It reminded me of the film,
Coma, where their bodies were suspended in the air. That was scary
enough. I think the mind is an untouched part and not used enough but I
wouldn&#x27;t mess with it like this because there is always the trouble
that you can&#x27;t get back to reality which may not be so bad after all.
