There were only a handful of moments throughout &#x22;Inception&#x22; where I
didn&#x27;t feel like I was watching actors going through the motions of a
plot too complex for them to keep track of during filming. I imagined
the directorial staff telling them: &#x22;Hey you, run over here, then turn
around that way.....just do it, don&#x27;t ask why right now!&#x22;<br /><br />I don&#x27;t think DiCaprio was very well cast. He can be intense, but often
comes off like a teenager posing as an adult. This role called for
someone more eccentric with a mysterious presence. Likewise, the
architect girl seemed like she belonged in high school, though she was
nice to look at.<br /><br />The plot had a good premise but it barely got me involved
psychologically. After the first hour or so, the layers of complexity
got ahead of themselves and erased any real feeling of suspense. You
need a decent grasp of what&#x27;s actually going on to feel suspense. Due
to the lack of focus, I found my eyes straying to things like the
Joliesque bump on the wife&#x27;s forehead, etc. A good film doesn&#x27;t let the
mind wander.<br /><br />After a point, this thing became so convoluted that I was trying to
figure out how it was made (on a technical level) rather than putting
serious effort into following the plot. Yes, I got the gist of the
dream layers and the general plan, but the timing of the &#x22;kicks&#x22; became
too hard to follow.<br /><br />I spent half my viewing time wondering why dreams, which in real life
contain random absurdities, could be so precise, down to the timing of
bombs. These dreams never seemed like ones I&#x27;ve experienced, so the
main premise of the movie was &#x22;kicked&#x22; out the door early on.
Technology- wise, it seems highly unlikely that people could share
dreams except for random electrical pulses.<br /><br />Maybe it played better in a big theater with the crowd adding to the
substantial hype that preceded it. I saw it at home on Blu-ray and it
just didn&#x27;t fire me up. I even considered turning it off twice, but the
very end was clever enough to make it worth the slog.
