Leonardo DiCaprio has been one of my favorite actors for a long time.
He has starred in some of my favorite movies, such as The Departed,
Blood Diamond and Shutter Island. Christopher Nolan became one of my
favorite directors after he catapulted the Batman franchise into the
best superhero movie of all time. The two of these men collaborating on
Inception results in pure movie magic.<br /><br />DiCaprio plays Cobb, the leader of a team of extractors. In a world
where the technology exists to enter someone else&#x27;s dreams, extractors
break into these dreams and steal ideas from their subconscious. Cobb
and his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, 500 Days of Summer) are
hired by a rich business mogul (Ken Watanabe, The Last Samurai) to
perform &#x27;inception&#x27;. Inception is a completely different technique then
extracting, instead of stealing an idea, you implant an idea in someone
else&#x27;s head. However, this is extremely difficult as you have to trick
the person into believing that this idea was their own. As Cobb and
Arthur begin to prepare, they assemble a team of dream-thieves. There&#x27;s
the architect (Ellen Page, Juno), the forger (Tom Hardy, Black Hawk
Down) and the chemist (Dileep Rao, Avatar).<br /><br />In the meantime, Cobb is haunted by a projection of his late wife Mal
(Marion Cotillard, La vie en rose) who invades his dreams and foils
there plans. Cobb must try to suppress his love for his wife in order
for the mission to succeed, despite the fact that he keeps thinking
about her, as his dreams are the only way to keep her alive. Also, Cobb
has to complete this job in order to get home to see his children. This
is just one of the many layers in Nolan&#x27;s brilliant storyline. As the
team goes deeper into each dream to attempt to implant an idea in
another man&#x27;s head, the team (particularly Cobb) begins to lose a grip
on what is real, and what is just a dream.<br /><br />Inception was filmed amazingly. If Christopher Nolan doesn&#x27;t get Oscar
nominations for his performance as a writer and/or as a director, I
will be shocked. The mere size of some of the effects is breathtaking.
However, Nolan keeps it down to earth with a very good cast and great
storyline, as a film of this size has the potential of becoming a
CGI-driven mess. Nolan manages to avoid this completely, creating an
almost perfect story which draws you in, and really leaves you thinking
about the characters and the events which just transpired on-screen.<br /><br />I saw Inception five days ago, and I am still recovering from the
&#x27;shock&#x27; of such an awesome movie. It took me at least a day just to
finish putting all of the pieces together to fully understand the
movie. I highly recommend Inception. It contains great acting,
direction and special effects. This is definitely going to be one of
the best movies of the year.
