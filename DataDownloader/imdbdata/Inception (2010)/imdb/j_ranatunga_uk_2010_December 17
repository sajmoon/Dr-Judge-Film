Not quite mindblowing, but it did stand out from the riff raff, with an
interesting plot involving interesting, albeit, thoroughly fictional
concepts and had elements that would involve to any adult. Not to
mention the stunning visuals, and action sequences, which, although not
overdone, did add that little bit of spice to a great mix. I also liked
the way the movie managed to do without a cheesy sex scene, but instead
made way for a great love story. Yup, it&#x27;s not everyday you watch a
movie that has a character that stands out above the rest, and, more
importantly, about which, at the end, you don&#x27;t have much to complain
about... all credits to Christopher Nolan for writing, directing and
producing a great movie - he&#x27;s gone a long way since Memento!
