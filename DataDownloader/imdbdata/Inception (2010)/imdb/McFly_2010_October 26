I love this movie, it was just so creative and original, but the plot
was SO complex and can be very confusing at times, how confusing?
Imagine trying to take a test and some of the questions on it are
questions about stuff you never learned. Okay, it&#x27;s not that complex,
but boy do you have to pay attention.<br /><br />So anyway; the story is about Cobb (Leonardo Dicaprio), a man who with
a machine that for SOME REASON never has a back story allows him to go
into other people&#x27;s dreams and steal ideas in their subconscious. He&#x27;s
one day told that if he can plant an idea in a CEO&#x27;s mind that he can
have a normal life again and that&#x27;s along story. Plus, it turns out
that the people in another person&#x27;s dream will attack any &#x22;invaders&#x22;,
which they can tell by if the &#x22;invaders&#x22; create too many things in the
dream and stuff like that. And it turns out that the CEO was trained to
fight against &#x22;invaders&#x22;, making the mission even harder. And to plant
this idea, they have to go into a dream, within a dream, within a
dream.<br /><br />Everyone did a great job at acting, but some of the characters didn&#x27;t
have that much character development. The visual effects were
unbelievable, you won&#x27;t believe some of the things done in this movie.
The fight scenes were very well choreographed and very creative, some
of the best I&#x27;ve ever seen in a movie.<br /><br />Good things: Great acting, effects, creative story and fight scenes,
will leave you with a great feeling.<br /><br />Bad things: Story is very complex, not much character development for
some characters, not much of a back story to the machine itself.<br /><br />But overall, this movie was amazing and must be seen in theaters.<br /><br />I give this movie a 9/10 with the title of &#x22;Superb&#x22;.
