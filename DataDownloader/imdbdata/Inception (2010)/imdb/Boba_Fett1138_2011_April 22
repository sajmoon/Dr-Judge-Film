Like every movie genre, science-fiction movies always keep on evolving
and reinventing itself. This movie is typical for the new modern
science-fiction movie; a movie that makes you think but at the same
time also presents you with stunning visuals and spectacular action. A
trend first started by the first &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; movie, over a decade ago.<br /><br />It&#x27;s amazing how Christopher Nolan keeps growing as a director. To be
fair, I have never been too impressed with him when it came down to
action but with two Batman movies behind his belt he has obviously
learned and action-wise &#x22;Inception&#x22; definitely is his best and most
impressive movie till date.<br /><br />But above all things &#x22;Inception&#x22; still remains a story driven movie.
It&#x27;s a clever movie that constantly forces you to keep paying attention
and reading into things, in order to keep track of it all. Yes, this
can get a bit too much at times and the movie also stills leaves up a
lot to your own interpretation. Nothing wrong with that but I still
would had preferred if the movie explained some things more clearly.
Not that the story has any lazy writing in it though, the movie has
plenty of twists and unexpected moments in it to keep you interested
and on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />What also makes this movie better and more classy than the average
genre attempt is its acting. The movie is truly loaded with big names,
even for the much smaller roles within the movie. No doubt Nolan&#x27;s
reputation had everything to do with all of these big names attaching
themselves on to this movie. I must say that this movie also probably
features one of Leonardo DiCaprio&#x27;s best acting jobs till date. I never
really saw him as a big action hero star but with this movie he
actually proofs that he can really pull it off and carry an heavy
handed science-fiction/action spectacle with his acting skills. It&#x27;s
actually pretty pointless for some of the other big name actors (I&#x27;m
talking about Michael Caine and Pete Postlethwaite for instance) in
this movie to appear in some much smaller roles but this is just
something Christopher Nolan seems to like to do, with all of his latest
movies.<br /><br />But it of course also really still is a science-fiction movie, meaning
that it&#x27;s filled with lots of spectacular looking special effects. The
movie uses them in a very original and creative way, while serving its
story. The movie impresses with its visuals but it above all things
also serves a purpose within the movie, so it doesn&#x27;t ever gets pushed
into your face. No wonder the movie basically won all technical awards
at the Academy Awards ceremony.<br /><br />Thing that also really matches its visuals is the musical score by Hans
Zimmer. To me it&#x27;s the score of the (last) year and up to par with
Zimmer&#x27;s his best scores.<br /><br />I won&#x27;t think this movie will top any of my top lists but it
nevertheless remains one superior made science-fiction spectacle, that
lets its 2 and an half hours fly by.<br /><br />8/10<br /><br />http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/
