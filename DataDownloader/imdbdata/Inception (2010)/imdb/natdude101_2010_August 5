Inception is the latest film from Writer/Director, Christopher Nolan.
The same guy who brought the world Batman Begins, Memento, Insomnia,
The prestige, and, most importantly, The Dark Knight. Seeing as how The
Dark Knight is one of my favorite films of all-time, I didn&#x27;t think
Nolan could out due this masterpiece. So, when I first heard of
Inception, I didn&#x27;t expect it to live up to The Dark Knight. I was
wrong. Inception is as good, if not better than The Dark Knight. I have
no idea how to even begin speaking of how great this film this is. The
cast is amazing, especially Leonardo DiCaprio, who gives the
performance of his life. The look is unlike any other movie ever. The
changing environments, the amount of layers, and the scope are unreal.
everything about this movie is just perfect. I&#x27;ll begin with the cast.
The Film is power packed with loads of great actors and actresses. I
already spoke about Leo and I&#x27;ll come back to him. Tom Hardy from Band
of Brothers plays a shape-shifting Eames. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays
Arthur, an extractor. Ellen Page, who played Juno in, well, Juno, plays
Ariadne and architect. Cillian Murphy, Who played a chilling scarecrow,
plays Robert Fischer, the future leader of a billion dollar energy
company. Dileep Rao plays a medicine man who produces the team with
drugs to enter deep sleeps. Ken Watanabe is the man who funds the
entire project. Marion Cotillard plays Mal, Cobb&#x27;s former Wife. And
good &#x27;ole Leonardo plays Cobb and extractor tasked with implanting the
idea of breaking apart a huge energy company soon to be run by Robert
Fischer. He puts together an elite team of 5(6 since the funder comes
along) to do this near impossible mission of inception. The look is
amazing. The constantly changing scenes, especially towards the end,
make an amazing feat of editing glory. The movie was filmed in 6
different countries going from a small hotel room to a snowy landscape
in seconds. The idea of layers also plays deeply in the movie. Its hard
to explain without spoiling the movie, but its a key concept that lasts
through out the entire film. I already spoke of the acting, but, god, I
was blown away. Leonardo DiCaprio gives an amazing performance as a man
who had everything and then lost it. the amount of emotion and
conveying is so intense that I have already nominated and given him the
academy award for best acting ever. the rest of the cast does well too,
but Marion does a great job as well. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if she was
nominated for best supporting actress. The Story is of course the best
part. This is an ever going film. You can&#x27;t look away for a moment. The
dialogue is some of the best I&#x27;ve ever heard. Lines that not only
develop the story, but show off Nolan&#x27;s ability to make characters
likable even with many flaws. The story follows these characters
through many environments, of course, but the pace of the movie is just
unreal. It isn&#x27;t fast, but it isn&#x27;t slow. Its not really in the middle
either. Its literally impossible to describe. The movie opens with Cobb
already in a dream, trying to perform an extraction. The dream,
however, is a test to see if Cobb can preform the art of inception.
Initially, he refuses, but after being offered a cleared name and his
family back, he agrees, saying, &#x22;I can do the inception. I&#x27;ve done it
before.&#x22; Cobb puts together a team of people to build the dreams and
help add an idea to Fischer&#x27;s mind. The only problem is, they can&#x27;t
give him the idea in a single dream. He would reject the idea. they
have to trick him into believing that he actually came up with the
idea. The devise a plan to go through 3 levels of dreams. I wouldn&#x27;t
spoil it for you, but the entire latter half of the film is shear
amazement. And for all of you who think all movies have predictable
endings, be warned. Inception has the greatest ending ever. Out of all
the stories I&#x27;ve ever heard, watched, read, or even played, none
compare to this one. The idea of the movie is amazing and very
original. I heard a lot of people say that they were comparing the film
to The Matrix, another very original film. I can&#x27;t think of any other
film that has used the idea of entering dreams. It sounds more like a
crazy religion that a movie, but Nolan does it and he does it well. I
can&#x27;t get over how great this film is. If you haven&#x27;t seen it, go right
now and watch Inception. Its the best and most original film that
you&#x27;ll see this year and maybe even this decade. Inception will be
remembered by many things. I will remember it as one simple thing,
perfection. 5/5
