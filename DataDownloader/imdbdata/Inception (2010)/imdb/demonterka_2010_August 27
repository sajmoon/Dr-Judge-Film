Boring. Overlong. Stupefying. Cheap.<br /><br />It&#x27;s easy to fool a sheep. Take an idea with great potential and then
throw it in a barrel and burn it. Then throw a banal senseless story
that barely looks complex, mix it with cheap action and waste over 2
hours of everyones lives. And the sheep rejoice because they think it
is intelligent, daring, original and emotional. The truth is sad; it&#x27;s
just another generic Hollywood blockbuster action set in a
,,fantastic&#x27;&#x27; setting. It insults intelligence and anyone with an IQ &#x3E;
70 gets it, and the majority praises it for it&#x27;s emptiness because only
that can they understand. <br /><br />These types of movies make me wonder if we really deserved a comet in
2012.
