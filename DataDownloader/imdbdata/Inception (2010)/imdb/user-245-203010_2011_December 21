2.5 hours of my life wasted watching this drivel. Sorry for fans of
this film but I thought it was garbage. I don&#x27;t like dream stories,
might as well be about wizards, anything can happen, there&#x27;s no
reality. I don&#x27;t like slo mo stuff or flying through the air. And why 2
actors as prime characters who look like children? I&#x27;m referring to
Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I like them both as actors but
they are supposed to be a crack team of experts, hard to believe when 2
of them look about 14 years old. They&#x27;d be great in a stoner movie or
something, not in something that&#x27;s meant to be serious. One of them
perhaps, but both, no.
