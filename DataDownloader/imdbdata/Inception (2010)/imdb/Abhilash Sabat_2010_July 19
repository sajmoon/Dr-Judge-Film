Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of
extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious
during the dream state, when the mind is at its most vulnerable. Cobb&#x27;s
rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new
world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international
fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being
offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life
back but only if he can accomplish the impossible-inception. Instead of
the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off
the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one. If
they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful
planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that
seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have
seen coming. Christopher Nolan, well this name is now among the most
talented directors of the new generation &#x26; arguably of all time. If
anyone having any doubts regarding it, it will be cleared once
Inception is being experienced. Yes, this is one of those movies which
not only can be watched but can be experienced as well. Whether it&#x27;s
the mind twisting thrills of Memento or the adrenaline pumping
sequences of The Dark Knight, you will experience everything here. With
an incredibly amazing talented star cast &#x26; the clever direction of
Nolan, the final result is a Masterpiece for sure. Well, sure you will
need some time to know what exactly Inception is about. And maybe it
wont be possible to understand everything about Inception with just a
single watch. But such a fresh concept, with so much of energy, just
leaves you speechless &#x26; you just cant take your eyes off the screen
even for a minute &#x26; if you do, then probably you missed something
important. Nolan&#x27;s direction is just simply creative, as usual his own
style, trendy, full of emotions &#x26; mild humor. Logically speaking, its
flawless. Whereas the tremendous cast where Leonardo stands at the top
with his fabulous act which surely does reminds you of his character in
Shutter Island, but he is the true new generation star. Hats off to
him. Followed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken
Watanabe, Cillian Murphy, Marion Cotillard, Michael Caine (though a
guest appearance) each of them with a top notch performance. There&#x27;s
something really very different in this movie than the rest of the
Nolan movies, &#x26; i.e. the visuals of the movie. It&#x27;s larger than life.
Yes, the cinematography is stunning. The chase sequences, gravity
defying &#x26; slow motion moments blows your mind &#x26; lets you enter into a
new world. But unlike The Matrix, this has life like sequences of
action. But it surely does leaves you in a totally different world.
Hans Zimmer&#x27;s background score, is a class act again. Mr. Zimmer, you
are a legend. Final verdict: Undoubtedly the best movie of the year &#x26;
also maybe one of the very best movie ever made. Pure magic. Go &#x26;
experience it.
