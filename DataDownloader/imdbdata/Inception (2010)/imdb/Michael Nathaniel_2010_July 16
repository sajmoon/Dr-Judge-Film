In this movie, Nolan picks up the Freudian Theory of dream and pens an
intelligent and surreal script from it although he seems to borrow some
of this ideas from a Japanese anime movie Paprika. However, to condemn
this movie as a Hollywood CGI polished ripoff of Paprika is
preposterous. Inception stands on his own because it has an entirely
different plot and characters.<br /><br />The best thing about this movie are the settings, with a ton of dream
within a dream within a dream worlds, for me at least Nolan
successfully presents us with a fairly coherent state of one&#x27;s dream
(coherent enough to be filmed with CGI at least) without losing the
glorious incomprehensibleness of dream itself. However, sadly all of
the best CGIs and dream worlds stuffs here on this movie has been
spoiled in the trailer, the folding city, the zero gravity hotel room
and the icy fortresses.<br /><br />The acting quality of what could be considered the best all-star casts
in any 2010 movie complements the set and plot nicely without any
particular character chewing the scenery. However, somewhat annoyingly
in my opinion DiCaprio&#x27;s acting falls short and feels a little bit dull
compared to the sheer awesomeness of the environment. His character
seems distracted and somewhat bored throughout the movie. His inner
struggle projected in the dream settings throughout the movie in my
opinion totally distracts the flow of the plot and completely
unnecessary since we have already seen DiCaprio struggles against his
own mental projection and questioning reality in another movie. Shutter
** cough.. cough.. <br /><br />Now that I&#x27;ve written three paragraphs about this movie, I felt that
I&#x27;m somehow being to harsh. This is a really good movie, for me it
holds a respectable second best movie in 2010 after Toy Story 3 and
definitely a top 10 movie in this decade. The action is really intense
and the dream worlds presented by Nolan are really top notch. Although
the sub-plot DiCaprio&#x27;s mental stuff kinda drags a little bit, it
doesn&#x27;t decrease the sheer volatile awesomeness of this movie.
