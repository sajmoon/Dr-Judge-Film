All that stuff about sharing dreams makes zero scientific or
philosophical sense. And no-one can have dreams with that amount of
detail, that many actors, that much lightning fast action, etc, etc.
Read Daniel Dennett. <br /><br />There were plenty of stunning special effects and stunts certainly, but
I had the feeling throughout that the plot was just a peg to hang these
on. If you want to see how to do dreams in cinema, look elsewhere, for
example the dream sequence in Wild Strawberries, the Soldier&#x27;s dreams
in The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, the whole of Un Chien
Andalou. Even Buster Keaton did better than this in Sherlock Junior
80-odd years ago.<br /><br />If you&#x27;re going to make a film about dreaming, first figure out how to
film dreams.
