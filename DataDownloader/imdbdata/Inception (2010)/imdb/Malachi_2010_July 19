I just am not seeing the greatness of this film. There is no doubt
Nolan is an intelligent and imaginative guy. But I just could not fully
embrace the premise of this film, my brain struggled to accept what
seems so divergent from dream behavior. I know sci-fi/fantasy is all
about accepting a bunch of premises which does or can not exist in
reality, but at so many turns my suspension of disbelief was popped out
to ask the question &#x22;hmm does this really jive with EITHER my universe
or Nolan&#x27;s?&#x22;. Maybe I&#x27;m overly analytic, or maybe it&#x27;s the opposite and
I&#x27;m just too dumb to smoothly grasp and accept it - but in either case
I found the movie mentally agitating. He gets points for vision,
creativity and a lot of other positives - but when you&#x27;re so busy
questioning whether anything&#x27;s even plausible that you can&#x27;t even enjoy
the film, well, you get the idea.
