For a film of this kind to work there are (at the very least) three
script-writing requirements: a) internal logic, b) characters with
depth, and c) the complete omission of wise-a*s gimmickry.<br /><br />The film fails on all three counts.<br /><br />I liked the avalanche; I liked the freight train. I laughed at the
Kubrick tributes. Beyond that, the thing was too simple for words - but
dressed up to be a deep and meaningful experience. You know you are
watching a loser when an elevator takes you up and down the guy&#x27;s
consciousness. An elevator? Now who dreamed that up?<br /><br />World domination? A Japanese accent that is unintelligible? Cartoonish
characters of all shades (to sell tickets?) Two female leads, one of
whom is frighteningly out of whack with the film&#x27;s storyline (she
doesn&#x27;t understand anything, but is designing the project!), and the
other wandering through scenes meant to be scary but - hey, you need to
be able to act first, and it would help to then act scary.<br /><br />This film is a mess - except for the avalanche and freight train.
