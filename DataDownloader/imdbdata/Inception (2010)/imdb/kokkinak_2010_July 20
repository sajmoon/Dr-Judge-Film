I found this movie to be very intelligent and entertaining. I must say,
however, that you must be able to comprehend movies far beyond the
surface to appreciate this flick. Beyond the obvious, there is an
underlying theme that dominates the movie: Can the mind triumph over
feelings? Ultimately, the decision is yes. Grab your bag of popcorn,
kick back, and let your mind lead you to a well-constructed &#x27;fictional
reality&#x27; which unlike &#x27;real reality&#x27; is not sequential but parallel, a
reality where place and time do not seem to matter and the only thing
that guides you is the power of your mind. Imagine if you could free up
your mind, be whoever you want to be.......just fly!
