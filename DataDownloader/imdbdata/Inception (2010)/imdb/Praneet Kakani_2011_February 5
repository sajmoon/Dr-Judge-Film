2011_February 5 
To start off with, i have always been a Nolan fan but never really put
him above Kuberick, Kurosava and thought he just about tied with
Scorsese and Tarantino. Obviously his success rate is undoubtedly much
higher than any director, so naturally I went in with high
expectations. I have seen and adored every past movie of Nolan but this
was different. Inception is a movie that scales off from all other
movies. It has such a depth in it&#x27;s plot, such intense direction and
such amazing cinematography that you just don&#x27;t want to take your eyes
off the screen. It is understandable though, it has gone over the head
off many people(including many famous critics) who have seen this and
they are wondering what the whole hype is about. Inception is a movie
that if understood to it&#x27;s full extent will never be forgotten, ever
and if you do not understand the movie fully, you will despise it as
you will feel the story is haphazard. On the contrary it is very
intelligently and carefully plotted and is way above any movie ever
made. After the movie has ended you are left there shell shocked and
wondering. Thats what and excellent movie can do leave layers of
thoughts even after the movie is over. The movie was like poetry, you
really need to understand and search for it&#x27;s essence and when you find
it you will be left wondering from where this abyss of thoughts came
by. This movie Nolan has truly outdone himself and has made his mark in
history as one of the greatest movie makers ever. The only tragedy
remains that not everyone could grasp the exquisiteness.<br /><br />PS: This year has been provided with so many excellent movies that you
can&#x27;t really judge this movie by the Oscars it wins, however having
seen all the others, I really feel it should win the best picture as it
is a notch above the social network, black swan, etc etc.
