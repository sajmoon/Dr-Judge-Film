&#x22;Take Keanu Reeves in Johnny Mnemonic (1995), The Matrix (1999), and
The Scanner Darkly (2006) with some dream elements of Constantine
(2005), and Jennifer Lopez in The Cell (2000), and Dennis Quaid in
Dreamscape (1984), Emilio Estevez in Freejack (1992) and take the
emotional intensity of a timebomb and the ripping nature of a marital
knife and the action thrills and musical cords of Matt Damon in The
Bourne Identity (2002) and one might get some hint of this finely
complex and taut sci fi action thriller. Inception (2010) is to dream
sci fi fantasy as to what Brain Storm (1983) is to dream sci fi
reality, Natalie Wood&#x27;s last movie and her tragic death during the
movie. What&#x27;s real and what&#x27;s not real, what&#x27;s desired and regretting,
themes of guilt and acceptance are all wrapped up in this dream within
a dream that is taken to the power cubed. While there are a few logical
incongruities and editing weaknesses, one of the most prolonged are
they going to survive experiences in movie history on this roller
coaster ride more than washes over any perceived problems with this
movie. How many times did Director Christopher Nolan have to shoot the
final scene would be one of the more intriguing questions of the movie.
It&#x27;s not so much that the visual effects are spectacular, but that they
are used in a way that enhances the movie and visually are different
enough to make an indelible impression. Ellen Page stands out as a
distinctly difference character from her role in Juno (2007) and Marion
Cotillard demonstrates where Oscar winning talents from La vie in rose
(2007), especially her facial emotional expression at the beginning of
the movie that stings with its power. One of the most powerful and
distinctive movies of 2010.&#x22;
