My hands are shaking while writing this review. &#x22;Inception&#x22; is amazing!
Well, my favorite movie by Nolan was &#x22;Batman Begins&#x22; (which by the way
has an excellent plot and acting and is immensely splendid) until i saw
&#x22;Inception&#x22; today evening... No &#x22;Dark Night&#x22; or &#x22;Memento&#x22; or &#x22;Prestige&#x22;
can compete. &#x22;Inception&#x22; will literally blow your mind away to cloud
nr. nine and leave you with a will to watch it again at least one more
time. At least. It is really like nothing you&#x27;ve ever seen before.<br /><br />I mean.. really. Is it possible to create a plot this intriguing,
captivating and great? Obviously yes. Like most of DiCaprio&#x27;s (and
Nolan&#x27;s) work this movie is clever, has a brilliant plot (and even
better cast) and is a fantastic experience in movie watching. I have to
say that you really get absorbed into &#x22;Inception&#x22; and well, at least i,
have a strong wish to dream and dream and dream.<br /><br />The cast.. Leo, Joey Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Ken Watanabe, Cillian
Murphy, Michael Caine, Marion Cotillard.. first class all of them. And
everyone makes you feel like you&#x27;re having an experience of a lifetime.
The film itself is a spectacle of an eye and a true masterpiece. The
plot is too great and complicated to waste time on summarizing or
bringing out some important aspects. To heck, you&#x27;ve got to see it
yourself. It combines both action and intelligence in the best
imaginable way.<br /><br />I loved every second of &#x22;Inception&#x22; and this movie is really a one that
you don&#x27;t want to end. You want to live in it for a little longer. You
want to dream on. So i&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a definite must-see. It will make
your brain hurt. Big time. And in a very good way. One of the best. I
think i have a new favorite. So go storm and watch it!!!
