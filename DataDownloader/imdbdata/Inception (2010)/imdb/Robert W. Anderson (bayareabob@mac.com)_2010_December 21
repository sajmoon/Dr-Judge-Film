I&#x27;m thrilled someone in Hollywood is still making great movies. This is
an exciting thriller that will have you questioning what you know about
what just happened and what might be going to happen. Hollywood has so
messed up their product lately I was waiting for more then half the
film for them to stick some political story line into the film. This
was an artfully done thriller about a group that developed a process to
plumb the depths of our dreams for secrets. In this case it was company
secrets. But it&#x27;s not possible to watch a film like this a speculate on
all things that could be done with this ability. The effects are
stunning, it well written, and the cast is great. And it&#x27;s especially
nice to see Sir Michael Caine. I&#x27;m not going to give anything specific
away. I will only recommend don&#x27;t miss this film. There are no tie ins
to current events, no preaching just good fun. Like it supposed to be.
