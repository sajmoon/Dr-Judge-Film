This splendidly visual film is not the 2nd coming nor will it best The
Dark Knight at the box office. On positive notes, what this movie is&#x85;
is a splendidly-photographed, very well-scored, strongly
production-designed/set decorated drama with straight-forward acting
that improves... no, brings out&#x85; no, lifts up the overlong screenplay.
Ellen Page deserves a supporting Oscar nom. On negative notes, some
critics complain of too much exposition and several implausible
scenarios. Since &#x27;Inception&#x27; is all a dream within a dream within&#x85; the
implausible scenarios become plausible because they&#x27;re happening within
dreams. My complaint is that there is way too much studio-mandated
explosions, gunfire, and car chases. Nolan may never be able to make
another &#x27;Insomnia&#x27; or &#x27;Memento&#x27; in his career. He&#x27;s the official Warner
Brothers, if not industry, stalwart director. The man with the Midas
touch, and the cost/price of that money-making achievement is all the
unnecessary studio-mandated explosions, gunfire, and car chases that
bloat &#x27;Inception.&#x27;<br /><br />One last note, &#x27;Inception&#x27; employs a cliffhanger (possibly to ensure
material for Warner Brothers sequel films) that lacks resolution
creating an anticlimax to a story in which the audience has invested 2
hours and twenty minutes.
