I still don&#x27;t think this guy has melded his talent into a great
movie...although I&#x27;m sure most will disagree. The closest he came in my
opinion was &#x22;The Prestige&#x22;. If he ever gets the emotional part of the
movie to be the driving force....&#x26; gets his very bright ideas to seam
together just right.....I think he could make a movie thats as
unbelievably good as most folks think this one is.<br /><br />Lets see....who is the dreamer in this scene cut..are we at level 1,2,
or limbo, or somewhere else? Which players are on sedatives &#x26; what kind
of Kicks do they need to go to the level somebody thinks they should be
at &#x26; should they be synchronized kicks with music and/or free falling,
and/or feeling gravity, etc. ad infinitum. <br /><br />Cut to the mountain fortress snowmobile scene....I thought for sure a
scene from a James Bond movie got cut in by mistake here...all the bad
guys wearing the same uniforms &#x26; chasing the good guy(s)&#x26; setting the
explosives &#x26; shooting bullets galore....I guess this was an action
movie as well with the car chases and crashes &#x26; well, you know.<br /><br />This movie could very easily be summed up as a dream somebody
had....somebody that you never see in the movie...just somebody&#x27;s
dream. And some people think it was that.<br /><br />You have to give Nolan credit for a lot of his ideas, really good
production values, and other movie making strengths. I thought it went
way overboard with the complexity of who is the dreamer &#x26; who is
sharing dreams with who &#x26; what level are they on &#x26; what are all the
rules on that level, did they get into limbo &#x26; what is limbo exactly &#x26;
do you really feel pain if you get shot in the leg...but if you get
shot in the head you just wake up...or maybe go to double limbo if the
architects totem is spinning, but maybe it&#x27;s the dreamers totem, but if
it&#x27;s Cobbs totem &#x26; he got it from Mal it really doesn&#x27;t work for him
anyway. You could go on &#x26; on about this...but I guess you get my drift.<br /><br />I think Nolan has has the talent to make a great movie...but I think it
will have to get people in their emotional core &#x26; I don&#x27;t think he has
done that yet. I liked &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22; when &#x22;The Joker&#x22; character was
in the scenes...too bad about Ledger...he was really showing some
acting chops big time.<br /><br />I probably would have thought this movie was a lot better when I was
much younger.
