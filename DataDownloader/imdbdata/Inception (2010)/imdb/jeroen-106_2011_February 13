Can&#x27;t believe the high reviews as I think it&#x27;s the worst Nolan
productions to date. Means: it&#x27;s a good/average movie, but not great.<br /><br />The whole movie is just too stylistic, the romance is cold and
uninteresting, the characters are one dimensional, and the whole dream
thing is just too stylistic. The movie wants to be too intelligent for
its own good. I preferred how dreams where presented in &#x22;Eternal
Sunshine of a Spotless Mind&#x22;: blurry, not cohesive stories and
unpredictable.<br /><br />Inception used dreamworlds as a cheap way of adding car chases, shoot
outs in snow. The whole dream-in-dream thing is nice but doesn&#x27;t add
anything to the story.<br /><br />The romance thingie is just annoying to watch. I just don&#x27;t care. But I
should.<br /><br />Meh.
