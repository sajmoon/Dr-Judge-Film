Let me get this straight, this review is for the reviews of this movie.
I mean OMG how can one reviewer rate this movie with a 1 star and the
next with a 10 ? Are you guys really being objective when rating movies
? How can one spend probably more than an hour writing a review of a
movie !!! It took me longer to read one review than to watch the whole
movie !!! lol.... I know its the 10% unemployment !!! Anyway, this is a
pretty good movie, I knew what was going to happen BUT who cares ??? it
kept me entertained !!! If these type of movies don&#x27;t entertain you
then you are an onion and maybe should not be watching movies at all
!!! On the other hand, a 10 stars rating ??? Please no one is perfect,
we are all humans and there&#x27;s a small flaw on everything we do, even
plane manufacturers, a neuro surgeon or even NASA that should be
perfect (they can not afford a flaw or people will definitely die)
aren&#x27;t perfect !!! Watch the movie if you like movies, be open minded,
or not... BUT make sure of one thing, when rating movies, do it for fun
and try to be objective...<br /><br />In my opinion this movie deserves an 8 out of 10. Very entertaining but
not perfect because it was made by humans.
