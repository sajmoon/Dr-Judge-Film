With INCEPTION, Christopher Nolan proves once again that he is one of
the greatest directors of our time. This is a complex, mind-bending and
engaging story of dreams and the dangers they can present. It was an
original script, written by Nolan ten years ago, then rewritten and
worked on before shooting began. The result is a true cinematic
experience.<br /><br />INCEPTION is the story of Dom Cobb, a master thief in the art of
extracting secrets and ideas from people&#x27;s sub-consciousness, and his
search for a way home. Cobb is offered a job to plant an idea deep into
the mind of Robert Fischer, the heir to a multi-billion dollar empire.
In return, Cobb will be able to go home. Planting an idea is known as
inception, the opposite of extraction, but pulling off inception is no
easy job&#x85;<br /><br />Christopher Nolan manages to create something truly original with this
movie. The acting is wonderful, visuals are outstanding and the story
is complex and intelligent. Out of all movies released so far in 2010,
there is not a shadow of a doubt that INCEPTION is the best one, and
will remain at the top for the rest of the year. This one demands an
Oscar or three. Highly recommended! And, did I mention how amazing Hans
Zimmer&#x27;s score is? Well, it is.
