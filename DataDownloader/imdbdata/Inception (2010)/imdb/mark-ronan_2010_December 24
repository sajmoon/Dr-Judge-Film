This is my first review and i felt i had to write one because Inception
has become my favourite movie of all time. Everything about this movie
is perfect. The acting is top notch all round especially from Leo. The
plot is simple but Inception is not. I have now watched this movie six
times and it just keeps getting better upon every viewing. Inception
makes Matrix look mediocre in my opinion and will be a movie people
will remember more in the future. It is a breakthrough in cinema. This
movie proves that Christopher Nolan can make a smart and clever
blockbuster while mixing emotion with action and sci fi at the same
time. Not many can or ever will pull off what Nolan has done with
Inception. This movie gives me hope in todays world of cinema and
raises the bar for other film makers out there. Nolan pulls you in with
his wacky rules he has created in this movie and you can actually
relate to a lot of the theories in this on the way dreams actually work
in real life. All in all Inception is a films lovers film and a
thinking mans film. I feel Inception does require multiple viewings to
really appreciate and understand fully. There is more depth to
Inception than on first look. Inception. A Film By Christopher Nolan
10/10
