Here lies a piece with a prestigious director and a hyper-inflated IMDb
rating. This is a film more surreal than The Matrix, but fails to
establish a reasonable explanation for this fictional universe. It is
important that the audience can at least grasp the concept, too...<br /><br />The concept, for all intents and purposes, is golden. There will rarely
be a cooler premise than to enter the human subconsciousness. However,
this movie does not deliver as well as Shutter Island did for the
insanity (or perhaps faked insanity) of the protagonist. There also
lies the slightly lacking quality of Inception&#x27;s ending as opposed to
Shutter Island. In fact, most of this film reminds me of Shutter
Island...<br /><br />There&#x27;s this Molly character, which shouldn&#x27;t have appeared at all. Too
much action was instilled for there to be a fatal love affair popping
in every so often. This is an action-packed blockbuster. Most audiences
will agree that there was no feeling for the relationship between this
couple. It was undermined by the intensity of everything else currently
happening.<br /><br />Rule sets are always fun and work best in these types of playground
fictional worlds. Again, some are more surreal than others. This one
ranks very high on that scale, however, that is what kills the plot.
There are around 146,000 rules you have to remember and they are fed to
you every five minutes of the movie. One is looking for a recap every
five minutes let alone the 2 and a half hours of film. I am curious to
wonder what they could have done with all the time they used to explain
these rules and develop other scenes instead.<br /><br />Overall, this film quite deservedly serves 3 out of 4 stars. It is a
unique concept with convoluted ideas. One can&#x27;t help but think back to
Momemento with Guy Pierce and how that went. I would give that movie 3
1/2 compared to this. It was slightly convoluted but still kept in
sync. This movie is unsynchronized and leaves its audience unsensitized
(in a bad way).
