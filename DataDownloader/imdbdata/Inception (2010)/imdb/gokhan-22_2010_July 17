Today, I took a nap before I went to movie theater, since I knew that
this movie would be a mind blowing experience. There are still parts
that I did not understand, but probably I will watch it again and I
will understand much more better. I and my friend called this mind
blowing experience as Matrix effect(I did not understand Matrix totally
when I first watched it).<br /><br />I should say that movie is 148 min, but it is worth it. I think
describing the situation, putting things together and presenting a good
conclusion could not be illustrated for such a complex story in less
than this duration.<br /><br />DiCaprio&#x27;s character is full in depth and his struggle in his mind with
his dead wife presented in the whole story so well.<br /><br />Also special effects are gorgeous. Some of them were used in Matrix,
but all those city upside down effects are awesome.<br /><br />I should say that this movie is a really good mind blowing experience.
Probably most people will say it is a masterpiece. I do not know why
but it is not as good as Matrix. Actually when I first watched Matrix,
I thought as the same way. So my critics could change when I watch it
again.<br /><br />I strongly suggest Matrix lovers to watch this movie. Probably, you
will not totally understand in first time and you will definitely want
to see it again.<br /><br />I did not vote for this movie yet since I did not totally understand
the whole situation, there are a lot of points which I did not see or
understand. I will give this movie a second chance. Well job Nolan!
