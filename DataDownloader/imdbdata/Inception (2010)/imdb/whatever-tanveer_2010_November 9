2010_November 9 
Look I am a fan of Chris Nolan or at least I used to be. His movies are
always different and I liked them. Prestige was the first movie that I
watched of him and I loved it. The Dark Knight was the movie that I had
the highest expectations and it did not let me down. I know there are
10 things not to like The Dark Knight but for me there were 1000 things
to like. But this time I AM disappointed. Inception is like the cutest
car that can&#x27;t run very fast. It has its good looking but no good plot
and a million questions about the concept.<br /><br />There are a few simple rules about a science fiction movie or story.
When you watch one there are things you feel right or not. You can use
your wildest imaginations but at some point they have to make sense.
This film certainly did not feel right. This was like a low budget
science fiction which starts well but loses it after a while except for
this was a big budget movie! <br /><br />Well there ARE a few things to like about this movie. It has a good
concept, good graphics and good acting. If the plat was better and a
few more things made more sense this could have been the masterpiece
everyone thinks it to be.
