Visionary filmmaker, Christopher Nolan writes and directs a
psychological sci-fi about a &#x27;thief&#x27; who has the ability to go into
other people&#x27;s dreams. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) does not steal
things, but ideas. He is the ultimate weapon. But weapons have their
weaknesses too. After loosing everything, he embarks on one final
dangerous, yet exciting mission for desperate recovery. This time, with
the right equipment, the right people, Cobb dives into this mission,
without a second thought. However, when someone from his past shows up,
spoiling his plans, then what will happen? <br /><br />Nolan&#x27;s vision of &#x27;exploring the idea of people sharing a dream space &#x97;
entering a dream space and sharing a dream. That gives you the ability
to access somebody&#x27;s unconscious mind.&#x27; keeps the audience on the edge
of their seats,throughout the film. Totally different from his previous
films, like &#x27;The Dark Knight&#x27; and &#x27;The Prestige&#x27;, &#x27;Inception&#x27; is the
film, that will keep you wondering and makes you use a lot of brain
work, to figure things out.<br /><br />And I don&#x27;t think anyone could&#x27;ve played Dom Cobb better than Leonardo
DiCaprio. He as completely outdone himself and we can definitely see
that he has stepped out of the shadow as being known as Jack, from
&#x27;Titantic&#x27;. I just really hope, we see more of him on screen after his
performance. Even the other actors, like Ellen Page, Joseph
Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy has definitely left their mark! <br /><br />&#x27;Inception&#x27; is a roller coaster and the audience cannot help but get
involved in Cobb&#x27;s adventure. Every minute something is bound to happen
and obviously the audience does want to know what&#x27;s going to happen
next... don&#x27;t you? A must see! And one of my favourite films so far!
