Unlike most people here i don&#x27;t feel urged to show that i am not dumb
whether i liked the movie or not, it wasn&#x27;t at all that complicated to
understand it.<br /><br />I liked it because it was different and none of the characters went
overboard, most American movies today has that flaw, a comedy
characters are to hysterical no realism whatsoever or its all below the
belt. in action movies its important to have tons of explosions and be
cool and make the new coolest action scene ever, get shot in the arm is
OK without any reaction.<br /><br />sure there was action in this movie as well but i felt it didn&#x27;t go
overboard, its not a movie for kids.
