2010_July 30 
I did not enjoy this film one bit and its hard to know even where to
begin. The plot is confusing to say the least and at no time did I
understand anything that was happening. I felt the film was trying too
hard to be different and had a certain Matrix feel to it in a bad way,
the effects were good but to be perfectly frank I&#x27;m well aware of what
directors can do with effects in movies these days so I&#x27;m not
particularly impressed when they start doing elaborate visual effects
just for the sake of it. I felt there was no character development at
all and spent most of the movie wondering why the characters were doing
what they were doing and eventually started to realise that the aim is
to keep you on the edge of your seat but to be perfectly honest I
wasn&#x27;t kept on the edge of my seat in any sense and just found it
incredibly frustrating. I believe at times the film tries to cash in on
everyone&#x27;s common knowledge of dreams in the way of &#x22;oh yeah it is hard
to remember my dreams, and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a beginning or an
end in my dreams, I thought I was the only one&#x22; type of situation which
the film does to try and make you believe its almost talking directly
to you but personally I&#x27;m not fooled, yes its a novel concept which I
think has given a few a few easily pleased people the wow factor but
when the smoke clears I hope the punters realise there are better ways
to spend 2hrs and 20 odd minutes or better films to watch. The other
frustrating thing about this movie is how complex and hard it is to
take in all the information about dreams and your sub -conscious and
how all this works when they&#x27;re trying to get into someone&#x27;s head, it
went massively too deep and for a few split seconds it was a bit
thought provoking but that quickly turned into frustration and a
slightly stressed feeling because it just raises far to many questions
which the film just doesn&#x27;t, and probably can&#x27;t answer. To summarise I
would say that Chris Nolan did the most amazing job on the Dark Knight
but this has really let him down, he has picked a great cast for the
film and all are superb actors but couldn&#x27;t identify with this film one
bit and really just couldn&#x27;t wait for it to end.
