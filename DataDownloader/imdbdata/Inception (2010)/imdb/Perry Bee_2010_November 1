Damn this film rates high on IMDb, but I am not one for ratings. I
think a great film is like food, we have all different taste, and this
did not taste well for me. Sure it&#x27;s glossy, great special effects,
great cast. But this film is all over the place, just to many angle&#x27;s
with in an angle. Leonardo has made some great films, but after Shutter
Island I became less of a fan. I rate Shutter Island only slightly
better, but both are a let down for me. I am sure lots of people will
dislike my take on this over hyped film, what kills the story for me,
it has all these different layers inside layers, sure the idea is O.K
but it is not very well done in this film, just one big mess of special
effects, that leaves me just feeling very flat. I gave it a 3 out of
10, as visually it is pleasing.
