2010 is proving to be a landmark year for cinema, between Kick-Ass,
Shutter Island, Toy Story 3, and now Inception this is probably one of
the best years in movies that i have ever experienced.<br /><br />There isn&#x27;t much to say about this movie besides the visuals are
spectacular, the acting is as good as it gets, and the story is one of
the best in the past 10 years. The beginning of this movie is a bit
confusing because it throws you into the middle of it right away, but
if you can pull yourself together and make it through the first 15
minutes you will not regret it.<br /><br />Overall Inception has quickly become one of my favorite films, and 2010
one of my favorite years.
