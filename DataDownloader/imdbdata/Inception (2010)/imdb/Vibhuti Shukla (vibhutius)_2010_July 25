This movie is a perfect disappointment for those who watch to relax
after hard weekdays as they may end up pondering, pondering and
pondering.<br /><br />It is not just brainless action. For a movie there has been nothing
more complex which strains every cerebral nerve and leaves you
spellbound. If you don&#x27;t like to spend your gray matter on movies, this
is not for you.<br /><br />The sequences strangulate the viewer, layer by layer, dream by dream
like a constrictor. You are made to believe what you could never
imagine. The director has full control whereas the spectator cannot
predict or prejudge anything. Nolan deserves a lot of credit to
visualize such a far fetched and abstract subject credible to the
viewer without making any fatal mistake.<br /><br />The movie is purely imagination and beyond most of ours&#x27;. It focuses on
the power of human mind and so many possibilities yet undiscovered. It
shows how our dreams actually are manifestations of reality, that ideas
can be stolen and manipulated while we are asleep.<br /><br />Apart from direction the visual effects were flawless. Background score
and sound effects are awesome.<br /><br />Deserves a perfect 10 on 10.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t call yourself a movie enthusiast if you didn&#x27;t watch this one.
