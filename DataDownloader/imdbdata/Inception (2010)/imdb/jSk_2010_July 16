I always type my reviews in Notepad, but no &#x96; Inception deserves
better. After a run of the most amazing films ever &#x96; Memento, Insomnia,
Batman Begins, The Prestige, and of course, The Dark Knight (my all
time favourite!), Nolan is finally ready with his next experiment:
Inception, a dream-come-true movie (which is kind of ironic!) that
makes us question the existence of the very world around us. One
assumed that The Dark Knight was the ultimate peak that any film maker
could ever reach &#x96; Nolan included &#x96; but this young director refuses to
accept that there is a Cloud 9 &#x96; and simply questions, &#x22;What next?&#x22; And
BANG answers it himself: Inception. My new all-time favourite.<br /><br />The English Dictionary defines &#x22;inception&#x22; as &#x22;origin&#x22; &#x96; basically,
that is what the film is about. It&#x27;s about planting an idea in
someone&#x27;s mind, hence, &#x22;originating&#x22; an idea in that person. It&#x27;s the
most amazing experiment anyone has ever performed: an impossible world
where you enter dreams, and dreams within dreams, and dreams within
those, until you realize that such a movie is only ever found in
dreams, except that Nolan doesn&#x27;t think so.<br /><br />Nolan uses his incredible direction skills in this movie to make it the
wonder it is. His direction is what makes this film tick. His timing is
just amazing. Caprio does full justice to his character, Cobb. Zimmer&#x27;s
music keeps us with Nolan&#x27;s pace, which is why it all turns out to be
so incredible. The cinematography, superb, the special effects, superb,
the editing, perfect, the script, brilliant. This movie has everything!<br /><br />But then the only question that people are asking now is &#x96; which one is
it &#x96; The Dark Knight, or Inception? I&#x27;ll be blunt honest. The reason
Memento didn&#x27;t work as well as TDK, despite being an amazing film, is
that it wasn&#x27;t a film for everyone. Only those people who&#x27;re willing to
take the weight, the tension, and those who have a high presence of
mind, and an understanding of the complexity of a highly complex film
will be able to fully enjoy the film. Inception pushes TDK aside with
ease, but not for the entire world. If one has noticed, then you can
see that Nolan is following an alternative pattern in all his films
that have made it to the Top IMDb 250: Memento, highly complex, Batman
Begins, not so, Prestige, complex again, The Dark Knight, not so, and
now Inception, his most incredible project.<br /><br />I immediately called up people after the movie, telling them to go
watch it, and I was shocked beyond anything when one of the friends
said, &#x22;I&#x27;m going for Eclipse. Can&#x27;t.&#x22; Learn your lesson, people, do NOT
miss this wonder. Like Toy Story, this too comes once in a decade.
Though in Nolan&#x27;s case, that&#x27;s not true. Trust Nolan. Now, I can&#x27;t wait
for Batman 3.<br /><br />10/10. Damn! Isn&#x27;t there anything more than that?
