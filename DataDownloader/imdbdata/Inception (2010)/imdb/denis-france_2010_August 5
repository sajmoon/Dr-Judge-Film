First I&#x27;d like to dedicate some first statements to those dumb,
subjective and most of all &#x22;kill the fan&#x27;s movie&#x22; reviewers that
they&#x27;re full of...<br /><br />Now I&#x27;ve heard somebody saying this movie cannot match against Pulp
Fiction, The Good The Bad The Ugly, Goodfather, One flew over the
Cucko&#x27;s Nest and films as high as these. <br /><br />Let me say I saw almost all the movies on the IMDb list, some don&#x27;t
deserve to be as high as the list claims, so deserve to be even higher,
after all the users decide. And it&#x27;s worked pretty good so far.<br /><br />Now the rating for Inception would be: <br /><br />Plot: 9<br /><br />Special Effects: 9 <br /><br />Cast: 9<br /><br />authenticity: 9 <br /><br />Makes it a niner, but since I was hyped about this movie, and am a
personal fan Of Chris Nolan, I give it a ten, after all, it probably
deserves it too. Why? Not because people are fans, not because people
were too much hyped in the stars, because it certainly deserves to be
one of the best. A 20-year old work stands on it and proves it.<br /><br />Now where was I? Along Pulp Fiction (Which I think is totally overrated
and pretty much a simple movie), Inception can definitely match and
maybe even surpass the top 10 movies on the list. Now I saw all of them
on the top 10 list, that was, no one can say I&#x27;m just an ignorant fan,
I&#x27;m also a fan of Sergio Leone and Hitchcock, but frankly, no one can
outdo Nolan in nowadays.
