Alright let me start this off by repeating myself, this is movie making
at it&#x27;s finest! Inception, made by the Mastermind Christopher Nolan, is
easily one of the best movies I&#x27;ve EVER seen. First off, the
cinematography is ridiculous in this movie and it&#x27;s one of the key
things that involve you so much in this movie! The acting which
obviously is lead by &#x22;The Man&#x22; Leonardo DiCaprio, is very great,the
supporting cast is also phenomenal! Now the best part of the movie is
the concept...It&#x27;s so damn intriguing! Truly I&#x27;ve seem it 6-7 times and
I just got full understanding for it....it&#x27;s definitely a thinkers wet
dream so to say! (haha) So basically,in a nut shell, Inception is one
of the best movies of All Time! IMDb even states it in there Top 250
located at 8! Go check it out either on DVD, or BluRay I don&#x27;t care
just see it! Believe me it&#x27;s definitely worth your time!
