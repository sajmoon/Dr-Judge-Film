I would like to preface this review by saying that this movie is
excellent, on multiple levels. It is visually thrilling,
philosophically pondering, and really, REALLY complex. It basically
invents an entire science, a sub-conscious engineering that provides
some of the strangest, and yet most interesting dialogue I&#x27;ve ever
experienced in a movie. See this movie. See it twice.<br /><br />Inception follows our hero, Cobb, who, after a failed job, is given a
ticket home if he can pull off the ultimate psychological heist: the
implantation of an idea in a subjects mind. This is called, well,
inception, which is often considered to be impossible for multiple
reasons. Cobb, however, knows it is wholly possible, for multiple
reasons as well. There can be no spoilers! I&#x27;m sure by now you all know
the whole &#x22;entering and controlling dreams so as to attain information&#x22;
idea, but the problem is, the origin and the very nature of this
dream-entering technology is highly vague. It&#x27;s original usage is given
a passing glance, but what is NEVER explained is how hooking someone up
to an IV can give you access to their subconscious. There&#x27;s also the
whole concept of the &#x22;kick,&#x22; or the feeling of falling that wakes you
up from a dream. It seems somewhat undeveloped, and you&#x27;ll see what I
mean if you go to see it.<br /><br />All in all, this movie will make you say &#x22;WHAT?!?!?!&#x22; a lot, but at the
end you may have some semblance of understanding as to what just
occurred. A very original movie with some amazing fight sequences, some
interesting commentary on the nature of reality, as well as a really
aggravating ending. That&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just true.<br /><br />Like I said. See this movie twice. It&#x27;ll be a lot less insane the
second time around.
