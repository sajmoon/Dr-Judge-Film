2010_August 29 
Now I will start by saying that for all the many flaws and silly plot
holes, which seem more glaring the more you think about them after
viewing the film, I did enjoy the ride. It didn&#x27;t really stick closely
to it&#x27;s own rules and some of the characters got lost in the shuffle -
well, most of them, I suppose - but at least Nolan was trying to create
something more than the same old flicks Hollywood churns out like the
hot-buttered popcorn you can buy at every cinema. It&#x27;s not terribly
original and nor should anyone buy into the hype that it is, but that
doesn&#x27;t mean it is without merit.<br /><br />To dispel the myth that this is original, I have to say it draws fairly
obvious comparisons to the following works, which isn&#x27;t to say it lacks
originality, more that it treads the same sort of path with a different
flavour.<br /><br />* The Matrix (1999) - Anyone who doesn&#x27;t see this must be blind; they
seem to come from the same seam. It&#x27;s one of the few similar films that
can stand up next to it though. * Dark City (1998) - The buildings, the
gravity. I can&#x27;t say more than that. * Blade Runner (1982) - Chris
loves this film. It&#x27;s more in visual styles than story but it&#x27;s there.
And when I think of the title I can&#x27;t help but think of the term
&#x22;incept date&#x22;. * Star Trek TNG - For the holodeck reference/style
mostly. * Heat (1995) - The action scenes, despite the fantasy
settings, seem remarkably tight and often quite realistic. *
Synecdoche, New York (2008) - The more I think about it, the more
similar it seems to this film, and the more this film seems similar to
Dark City. Which is why I like them, I guess. * Eternal Sunshine Of The
Spotless Mind (2004) - Love is a big theme and how the mind deals with
it an even bigger one. It would spoil Leo&#x27;s story arc to say more. *
eXistenZ (1999) - Can&#x27;t believe I nearly missed this one. In that film
it is virtual reality, as with The Matrix, but there are still a lot of
parallels. * Ocean&#x27;s Eleven (2001) - The whole thing about it being a
concerted team effort to pull of such an ambitious caper.<br /><br />There are a lot of tiers at work here, and it&#x27;s probably going to be
the case that it&#x27;s good first time around, and perhaps more
intelligible after another viewing or three. Of course, the folks who
fund Nolan films are aware of this and are hoping to double their
revenue streams, actually adding this observation to some of the
marketing bumph in the hope of getting people to go and see it twice a
la Fight Club which makes me more than a little cynical, but I can wait
for the home release anyway and would recommend everyone else do the
same. This looks like a fun one to learn, certainly something worth
studying if you happen to have more than a passing interest in
film-making and convoluted slight-of-hand storytelling, and you really
need to be able to pause, rewind and freeze-frame advance certain
sections in order to do that.<br /><br />It mines the seam of &#x22;what is reality, really?&#x22; a favourite topic of
Andrew Niccols and Charlie Kaufman, too. Those are among my favourite
types of works because they beg endless discussion and if handled
correctly can be a great source of inspiration. As I have a soft spot
for those kinds of plots I suppose I&#x27;m naturally more willing to grant
a bit more leeway, because credit where it is due I did find myself
mulling over my perceptions of reality and re-evaluating the value of
lucid dreams. Most films leave no discernible traces in the minds of
anyone which makes this at least above average.<br /><br />The special effects aren&#x27;t overused and/or intrusive, merely adding to
the story I feel. And the mixture of CGI with real photographed
elements is deftly handled. There is the odd moment of &#x22;oh, too much&#x22;
or &#x22;not layer blended so well there&#x22; but trust me, it&#x27;s far superior to
a lot of the junk that gets through and at times I actually think they
were deliberately making it a little weird and obvious to show it&#x27;s
still not a real world.<br /><br />To tie this review up: as one of the seemingly few people who thought
The Dark Knight was a hopeless mess with very little to enjoy outside
of a fiery Heath Ledger performance it&#x27;s a welcome return to the
twisting story lines that are usually a Nolan trademark. Despite the
length there is enough going on that it doesn&#x27;t feel like a moment of
filler is present. Also, I would like to briefly point out that this is
the first film DiCaprio has starred in where I actually enjoyed his
performance completely.<br /><br />This film is not his best but nor is it his worst. It is well worth a
watch, no doubt about that, but it shouldn&#x27;t be heralded as a
masterpiece and as of the time of writing this review is far, far too
high in the IMDb Top 250. I&#x27;ll grant that it is better than most of the
cookie-cutter remake product that Hollywood is very fond of dishing up
as of the past decade or so, therefore it looks better by comparison,
but it isn&#x27;t quite coherent enough to be brilliant. Hopefully it will
inspire other writer/director auteurs to come up with similar, perhaps
more lucid works. As it is, Memento (2000) and The Prestige (2006) are
still the high watermarks against which few others can measure up, even
the man himself. But it&#x27;s still one hell of a ride.
