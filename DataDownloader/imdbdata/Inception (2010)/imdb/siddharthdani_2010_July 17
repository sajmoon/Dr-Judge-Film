This movie is about dreams in a sense that the main characters have the
ability to dream on demand, and enter other peoples&#x27; dreams. I have
always been fascinated by dreams; the difference in the perception of
time in dream space; the effects of the physical changes occurring in
the dreamer&#x27;s reality to the events in his or her dream. <br /><br />I was excited towards the beginning of the film where the main
characters are shown to explore and build dream worlds. The plot which
follows is too complicated to be enjoyed. It is a pretty good plot with
very few loose ends, but I felt that the filmmakers could have made a
more fantastic a more rich experience when it comes to the dream worlds
shown in the film. <br /><br />I would rate Shutter Island, which is similar in the sense that it
deals with the imaginative powers of the mind and its effects, a lot
higher. Or a film like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, where
thoughts and memories and the wanderings of the mind are depicted in so
touching a manner. <br /><br />Inception has gunmen and hand grenade launchers, fast car chases and
action...things which were not completely necessary for the plot to
seem effective. I felt that the film could have made use of the
creative license that dreams gives it, in a far more effective way. <br /><br />Also, Dreaming Is a Private Thing. Sharing dreams is a definite no no
