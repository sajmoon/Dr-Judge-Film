I would have walked out of this film 30 minutes into it, if I went
alone to the theater. Anyway, to sum it up: This film was a torture to
sit through. Do the directors think that every audience member has an
attention deficit disorder? The film tried SO hard to blast the
audience away with special effects and quick editing every other 5
seconds that it forgot a storyline. Leading to my point, what the was
the film about? I still have no idea, nor do I care to know. It was a
confusing mess. And I could care less about any character in the film
either. I was actually hoping to fall asleep in the film because it
would have been a better well spent two hour dream than this nightmare
of a film! But all the noise of the film wound up giving me nothing but
a headache. They should have a discount for an aspirin on the back of
the ticket because you will need one after seeing this film. For a real
sci-fi film that is completely brilliant and moving, go rent MOON
(2009). MOON only had a budget of 3 million, with only one person
starring in the whole film, and it had more beauty in it than this
inception disaster could ever dream about.
