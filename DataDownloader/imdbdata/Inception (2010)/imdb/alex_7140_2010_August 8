I saw Inception yesterday, it&#x27;s a very good movie. However, I couldn&#x27;t
help not being disappointed, since I had read so many reviews saying
the movie is awesome, masterpiece, mind-blowing etc. So I went in the
cinema expecting to see of the best movies ever! And that was wrong.
While the movie is indeed good, and the idea is original, expecting too
much of it may leave you with a bitter taste.<br /><br />I rated this 9/10, so if my review may seem negative, it&#x27;s because you
get to read all the positive opinions in other reviews :) The plot has
many twists, and after a while they are difficult to follow. The dream
within a dream concept is scarcely explained and after a while it&#x27;s
hard to remember in who&#x27;s dream you are. When the movie ended, I was
trying to recall what happened to see if the chain of events makes any
sense. <br /><br />In conclusion, this is worth seeing, but don&#x27;t go with too high
expectations!
