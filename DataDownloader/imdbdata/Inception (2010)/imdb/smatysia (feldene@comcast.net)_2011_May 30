I found this film to be neither the greatest (sci-fi or not) film ever,
nor did it suck the way some recent commentators seem to think. I did
think it was quite good. Leonardo DiCaprio has finally grown up and is
an outstanding actor. Ellen Page was very good as well. (I had never
heard of her until she was recently in some TV commercials in the U.S.,
which told me that lots of other people know who she is) For a pretty
young actress, her role was 99% asexual. In only one very brief scene
would it have mattered if the role was played by a man.<br /><br />But the best thing about Inception was its originality. It was not a
sequel, remake, re-made TV show, or re-made comic book, which is all
that Hollywood seems to churn out these days.<br /><br />As for its complexity, I was able to follow quite well, certainly well
enough to enjoy it. The few points I&#x27;d missed, I read in the FAQ
section here, and frankly, I&#x27;m not sure I would have gotten them on a
second viewing alone.<br /><br />I understand why many folks are miffed by its high all-time ranking.
Y&#x27;all just have to understand that so many voters are young people who
have not seen, or do not like, classic cinema, so recent films will
always be overstated. It will be interesting to see what Inception&#x27;s
rating will be twenty years from now.<br /><br />I recommend checking it out.
