2010_August 19 
I&#x27;m from Europe which means we see most movies a little later than my
IMDb brothers and sisters from the States do, plus I&#x27;m in South America
right now which means I didn&#x27;t see it till yesterday. So it might be a
little late to put in my 2 cents but when I looked it up here last
night and saw it at #3 in the all time movie list I just had too.
&#x27;Cause in no way no how does this movie belong there. I&#x27;ll keep it
short cause a lot of people have already did long and thorough
explanations on exactly why #3 is to much for this movie but than again
what does a list with Toy Story at #12, Unforgiven at #104, Indiana
Jones above that and Shawshank Redemption at #1 really mean........not
much. However you cannot argue over taste so I&#x27;m not going too, and yes
I did get it. What I like about Nolan is that he must think his
audience is pretty smart, he gave us Momento (which in my book is way
better than Inception with a way smaller budget) and even the Dark
Knight has a kind of intelligence in it that you don&#x27;t see that much in
Hollywood. But I think this movie is asking to much of his audience
simply cause certain things don&#x27;t ad up. I amazed he got the studio
bosses to climb aboard with him on this one. It&#x27;s to much, or to little
depending on how you look at it. Nolan is one of the best directors
there is in Hollywood at this time but that doesn&#x27;t mean he has to
surpass himself every time, and he didn&#x27;t with Inception. Hell, Kubrick
made Eyes Wide sh*t, Eastwood dropped the ball on more than one
occasion and so did a few others. I hope Nolan won&#x27;t get to be this
eccentric arty farty director that just makes what he makes and just
expects everyone to dance along like Kubrick cause if he doesn&#x27;t we&#x27;re
gonna see some great stuff to come. But Inception ain&#x27;t one of &#x27;m. I
saw a review here about stupid people which although I would not use
that word does have a good point. And I saw another review where
someone put together a list of movies that dealt with the dream subject
better (although this movie is still way better than the Cell) but let
me just put in my view. Dreams move in another frame per second,
therefor it is not possible to have whole conversations or rides in a
car from A to B in a dream. Dreams are just fragments and that is why a
movie about dreams don&#x27;t work well in my book. All I can think about
when I see movies that deal with dreams is: &#x22;I never dream like that&#x22;.
I could go on and on but I won&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll give it a 7 and it might just be
an 8 if I see it again cause that is something you just have to do with
this one, but it could also change into a 6. Nothing more nothing less.
O and I like DiCaprio very much but I just cannot see him as a grieving
widow and father, maybe Edward Norton would have been a better choice.
