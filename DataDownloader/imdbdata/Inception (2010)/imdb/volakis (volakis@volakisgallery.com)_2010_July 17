The best movie I have seen come out of Hollywood in years! Matrix fans
will appreciate this film noir about dream psychology&#x85;what is real&#x85;and
what is imagined to be real. Brilliant plot, great photography, superb
effects but not TOO focused on the effects&#x85;just enough to keep up with
the story and convey the sense of the impossible without becoming an
outlandish effects movie. Character development was fine, the zero G
fight scene was STUPENDOUS&#x85;.all the time keeping track that your are 3
levels deep in a dream sequence (a dream within a dream..within a
dream). Wrap your little heads around that one for awhile. I can see
where mainstream audiences might have a hard time following this
one&#x85;but for the sophisticated viewer&#x85;this movie is a FEAST for the eyes
and for the brain. If Hollywood only had the balls to make more movies
like this. Bravo for Nolan. This one should prove to be one of the best
of 2010. <br /><br />GO SEE IT NOW!!
