Great movie. Getting &#x22;linked in&#x22; dream states which has its own flavor
of reality/whats real and not real. Good idea but it borrowed ideas
from other movies like The Matrix, Surrogates and probably others. I
remember watching Strange Days 13 years ago and now we have all these
movies which are using the idea of getting &#x22;linking in&#x22;. Its cool and
all but i wonder what the next one will be.<br /><br />I think it could have been crunched to 2hrs instead of 2.25hrs. There
were many scenes that dragged and hopped around. But ya i understand
the concept of the movie is highcore scifi and perhaps it had to be
made that way for people to get whats going on. Its definitely one of
those movies that keeps you engaged, intensely.
