What is real and what is not? That is the main idea of Christopher
Nolan&#x27;s newest film, Inception. This movie is great. The last hour of
the movie had to be one of the best movie experiences I ever had.
There&#x27;s so many layers of plot and action that it could very easily get
chaotic, but it&#x27;s all cut so professionally and logically that it makes
sense. Speaking of the plot, it kind of seems like The Matrix on
steroids, but that&#x27;s okay because there are enough novel elements that
it still comes off as original and extremely entertaining. The only
nitpick I have is that the characters were never really developed. The
action scenes are excellent, the visual effects are stunning, and the
sound is amazing (I literally jumped off of my seat during one scene in
the movie). When one sees it in IMAX, it&#x27;s going to be one of the best
movie experiences of your life.
