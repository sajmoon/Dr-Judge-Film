&#x27;Inception&#x27; is a work of bold ambition. It is Nolan&#x27;s true masterpiece
and one of the most original pieces of fiction ever put on film. <br /><br />The story, although multi-layered and complex, is incredibly engrossing
and a wonder to behold on screen. The movie follows Dom Cobb(DiCaprio)
as he leads a specialized team, tasked with putting an idea inside the
mind of Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). This task is called
Inception. Cobb specializes in the Extraction of ideas from people&#x27;s
minds in their dreams, but Inception is an entirely different story.
Removing an idea from a person&#x27;s mind proves easier because the person
has already thought it, but adding an idea is something that can&#x27;t be
done without carefully manipulating the mind to create the idea on it&#x27;s
own. <br /><br />This is the premise of &#x27;Inception&#x27;, and that&#x27;s only the surface. There
are so many layers to the plot that it&#x27;s almost impossible to divulge
even a fraction of the story in any less than a few pages. The script,
which took ten years to write, is pure brilliance. As the film
progresses it only becomes more intriguing, even up to the very end. <br /><br />The acting is superb across the board. The standout being DiCaprio, but
the entire cast delivers amazing performances. <br /><br />&#x27;Inception&#x27; is visually dazzling and unlike anything i&#x27;ve ever seen on
film. But even the amazing visuals don&#x27;t detract from the depth and
complexities of the plot. With amazing cinematography and a remarkably
well-crafted and fitting original score from Hans Zimmer, there isn&#x27;t
an area where the film doesn&#x27;t shine. <br /><br />This is truly Nolan&#x27;s best, and that is definitely saying something.<br /><br />10/10
