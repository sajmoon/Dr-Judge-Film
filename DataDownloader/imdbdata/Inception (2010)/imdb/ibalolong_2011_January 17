yes, it&#x27;s brilliant! the cinematic effect was outstanding! but what is
the real essence of the story? what is the core idea? simple: stealing
ideas or implanting one through the dream state. that&#x27;s it.<br /><br />i felt so dumb while i&#x27;m watching this movie. there are so many
questions left in my mind after. a good movie does not do that to
audiences. it can be complex, it can be convoluted, but in the end the
viewers should have a grip on it. at first, i was astounded by the very
idea of the story but as i reflected on it i realized that the only
thing the film successfully did is obscure the brilliance of the core
idea. a good movie communicates with its audience. inception only
blurred the communication lines.
