Writer-director Christopher Nolan explores the realm of dreams in
Inception, his first film since his acclaimed box office juggernaut The
Dark Knight. The sci-fi thriller&#x27;s premise sounds simple enough, but
its execution by Nolan is anything but. Ostensibly an international
heist caper, Inception follows Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), an
&#x22;extractor&#x22; whose form of corporate espionage is to invade the dreams
of the rich and powerful and pluck their most tightly guarded secrets
from the depths of their subconscious. &#x22;A single idea from the human
mind can build cities. An idea can transform the world and rewrite all
the rules,&#x22; Cobb says at one point. <br /><br />Cobb is an international fugitive due to a dark deed from his past that
prevents him from being able to return stateside to see his children. A
shady corporate titan, Mr. Saito (Ken Watanabe), offers Cobb a chance
to wipe his past clean and go home. The job? Inception -- planting an
idea into a mark&#x27;s subconscious rather than stealing one. Saito wants
Cobb and his longtime point man, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), to
invade the dreams of Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), the heir to an
energy conglomerate who is also riddled with daddy issues. Saito wants
to take out the competition so to speak. <br /><br />Cobb and Arthur assemble a team that includes the forger Eames (Tom
Hardy), Yusuf the chemist (Avatar&#x27;s Dileep Rao), and newcomer Ariadne
(Ellen Page), an architect who will literally design and build the
world of the mark&#x27;s dreams. Shadowing Dom in the dream realm is the
enzymatic Mal (Marion Cotillard), a woman from Dom&#x27;s past who threatens
the entire operation. (Michael Caine, Pete Postlethwaite, Tom Berenger
and Lukas Haas pop up in small roles.) The deeper Cobb and his team
venture into Fischer&#x27;s subconscious, the more dangerous the mission
becomes and the more likely it is that they could all end up trapped
there -- a seeming eternity in the time of the mind and a fate that
could render them all vegetables in the real world. <br /><br />With Inception, Nolan has made his equivalent to The Big Sleep (ironic
given the subject matter of Nolan&#x27;s film), a thriller whose near
indecipherable storyline will boggle minds for decades to come -- or
even his 2001, a genre opus guaranteed to confound or amaze viewers. Or
is it Nolan&#x27;s finally realized attempt at making a James Bond film? Or
a heist thriller to rival Heat? A better version of Dreamscape?
Inception is all of the above, and yet it&#x27;s also a singular
accomplishment from a filmmaker who has only gotten better with each
film. Indeed, Inception could very well be Nolan&#x27;s masterpiece.
