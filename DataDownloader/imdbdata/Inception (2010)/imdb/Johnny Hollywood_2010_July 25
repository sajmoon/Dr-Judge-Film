Anticipators called it the movie event of the year. Sceptics called it
the unnecessary cash-in following the insurmountable success of Nolan&#x27;s
earlier endeavour. I assure you, believe the hype. One of the most
ambitious films in contemporary cinematic history, Inception engages
its audience right from the opening scene like few other films before
it. Everybody delivers their A-game in a movie that draws inspiration
from Memento, The Dark Knight, Ocean&#x27;s Eleven, James Bond and The
Matrix (to name a few) yet remains powerfully original throughout.<br /><br />Without giving too much away, the film&#x27;s protagonist Dom Cobb, a
world-class thief with the ability to steal secrets directly from the
dreams in which they are locked away, is asked to do the opposite:
implant an artificial memory in the mind of a major corporate player,
in exchange for the clearing of his tarnished name. <br /><br />From there Nolan leads us through a complex world of metaphysical
creation; dreams- within-dreams, if you will. Indeed, it is the
director&#x27;s guiding yet stern hand that applies mind-bending depth to
this film. By this I mean that, yes, we are required to pay extreme
attention to the story at all times, but are aptly rewarded with an
expertly-crafted conclusion that literally leaves your heart pounding
and your head questioning the true meaning of the film long after the
closing credits.<br /><br />Nolan has already proved himself an excellent director, and Inception
has ensured his legendary status. But, for the film to be considered
truly great, it would have to be driven by Dicaprio. This is his best
opportunity to stand up and be counted among the greatest actors going
around today, and he delivers in a big way. He portrays an
inconceivably complex character in Cobb with such passion and
professionalism that it really is a toss-up whether the Academy will
nominate this, or another troubled role as Shutter Island&#x27;s Teddy
Daniels, as the vehicle towards his first independent Oscar. <br /><br />Not since The Godfather has such a standout lead performance been
matched, if not overshadowed, by an equally brilliant supporting cast.
Hardy, Watanabe, Murphy, Cotillard and Caine all act with poise, but
honourable mentions must go to Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ellen Page. As
Cobb&#x27;s right-hand man, Gordon-Levitt shares the comic-relief
responsibility with Tom Hardy, but never overplays his hand. Instead,
he gives off an air of utter confidence and capability, taking a role
supposedly reserved for Christian Bale and making it his own.<br /><br />Page plays Ariadne (alias: The Architect), the new kid on the scene who
acts as the audience&#x27;s window into this practice of inception. Once the
introductory details are dealt with, however, her character is quickly
developed into one that has great impact on the mission at hand. She
adapts very smoothly in a role that couldn&#x27;t be more different to her
breakout role in Juno, showing exceptional versatility and a promising
career in the future.<br /><br />Initially, I was reluctant to give this film the score I did because of
a lapse in the dialogue department for most of the first hour. However,
in retrospect, this aspect alone should not warrant a drop in the score
considering there was no appropriate alternative available to the
filmmakers at that point. This minor gripe of mine is swiftly swallowed
up in a parallel world of grand cinematography, engaging plot and
mental manipulation of the highest degree. You&#x27;ll never look back on
your dreams the same way again.<br /><br />*There&#x27;s nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So
