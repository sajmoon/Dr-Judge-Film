&#x27;INCEPTION&#x27;: Five Stars (Out of Five) <br /><br />If &#x27;ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND&#x27; and &#x27;THE MATRIX&#x27; had a child
together and &#x27;MISSION IMPOSSIBLE&#x27; was the sperm donor &#x27;INCEPTION&#x27; would
be the conception. Writer / director Christopher Nolan, arguably the
greatest filmmaker working today (and the man behind such beloved
blockbuster and indie cult classics as &#x27;THE DARK KNIGHT&#x27;, &#x27;BATMAN
BEGINS&#x27; and &#x27;MEMENTO&#x27;), gives us this ingenious sci-fi / horror / drama
/ &#x27;thinking man&#x27;s&#x27; action film about shared dreaming! The movie is so
well made and confident in every way that the viewer just automatically
believes they are seeing something truly great and clever from the
opening scene to the last. To carry out his impossible mission Nolan
has assembled the most talented and fitting cast and crew members he
possibly could.<br /><br />At the heart of the film is Leonardo DiCaprio&#x27;s performance. The man is
one of the most talented and iconic actors working today; like Tom
Cruise, Brad Pitt, Johnny Depp and a few others he&#x27;s as gifted at the
art of acting as he is famous and this is one of his best performances
to date (although very similar to another lead performance of his this
year in the similar themed Martin Scorsese film &#x27;SHUTTER ISLAND&#x27;, in
which he was also dealing with the battle of reality versus perception
and the reconciliation of the loss of a loved one in order to save his
sanity). There&#x27;s also the extremely talented Ellen Page, Joseph
Gordon-Levitt and Marion Cotillard in impressive key supporting roles
(as well as Nolan regulars Ken Watanabe, Cillian Murphy and Michael
Caine). The editing, cinematography, art direction, makeup, etc. are
all top notch as well but the most memorable and impressive thing for
me about the film (other than maybe the writing and directing) is the
score; Hans Zimmer (who also recently co-scored Nolan&#x27;s &#x27;THE DARK
KNIGHT&#x27; and &#x27;BATMAN BEGINS&#x27;) has outdone himself here with music that
embodies almost the entire film and empowers it. It&#x27;s almost as if he&#x27;s
created an entire new genre of score music and it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve heard
in quite some time (If Zimmer doesn&#x27;t win an Oscar for this there&#x27;s no
justice in Hollywood).<br /><br />In &#x27;INCEPTION&#x27; Nolan creates a very realistic and believable alternate
reality in which dreams can be shared and controlled and business&#x27;s as
well as of course government&#x27;s have created technology in which they
can infiltrate someone&#x27;s dreams and steal key valuable information from
someone&#x27;s subconscious, which they call &#x27;extracting&#x27;, at the time when
it&#x27;s most vulnerable (when it&#x27;s in the dream state). This is a very
dangerous and complex act though considering it requires a very strong
sedative to keep everyone involved in the dream asleep and therefore if
you die in your dream and cant wake up your mind goes into a deep limbo
which can seem like an eternity and drive you to insanity. This is made
even more difficult and frightening by the fact that the most at risk
minds have been trained to militarize their brains and established
dream defense units to ward off any intruders. DiCaprio plays Cobb the
most experienced and wanted dream expert the world has ever seen. He
leads a special unit of dream con-artists in routine &#x27;extraction&#x27;
assignments for various employers. His one flaw is that he&#x27;s haunted by
the loss of his wife (The very memorable Cotillard) on a dream
adventure they concocted together. Due to the suspicious circumstances
surrounding the death of his wife Cobb is wanted for her murder and
can&#x27;t return home to see his two young children. One big seemingly
impossible assignment involving the act of &#x27;inception&#x27; (implanting an
idea in a mind&#x27;s dream rather than &#x27;extracting&#x27; it) could change all
that, by clearing his name, and finally be his ticket home.<br /><br />The movie is extremely fast paced and complicated which does make it
very hard to follow upon first viewing but every detail of it&#x27;s fantasy
world is so well explained that this makes the movie so much more
enjoyable the second time around. The characters also feel somewhat
underdeveloped, all except for DiCaprio&#x27;s Cobb and his assignment; the
mark (Murphy), at least the first time around. There&#x27;s a lot of screen
time given to people like Page and Gordon-Levitt but all we really know
about them is what they know and think about the dream world and Cobb.
It kind of feels like a &#x27;MISSION IMPOSSIBLE&#x27; film in which players are
only put into motion to perform their skill in supporting the Ethan
Hunt character &#x27;Cobb&#x27; on his mission and character development. This
make&#x27;s the film some what frustrating and not relate-able considering
the fact that Cobb is a mystery most of the film and is only fully
understood and loved at the film&#x27;s end, which is a very emotionally
powerful climax. This all changes upon a second viewing though. Only
after you fully understand the dream world and what&#x27;s going on from the
very beginning can you fully appreciate every detail of every second of
the film and it&#x27;s characters. No longer are you head-ached by trying to
figure out what is going on and you pick up so much more of the film in
every way. These are the best films in my opinion; movies which require
multiple viewings to fully understand and love them. I can&#x27;t wait to
see this movie a third time and it&#x27;s by far the best movie I&#x27;ve seen so
far this year!<br /><br />Watch our review show &#x27;MOVIE TALK&#x27; at:
