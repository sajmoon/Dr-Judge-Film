Before going to Inception, I know this much about Nolan, I loved Batman
Begins and Dark Knight and I didn&#x27;t like Memento but I don&#x27;t remember
why - it may have been my state of mind, so I will rent it again to see
what happened. I also knew I was excited about seeing Inception thanks
to fantastic trailers and reviews.<br /><br />Arriving at the local, usually &#x22;ok&#x22; Carmike theater, I was upset they
put Inception on the smaller, non-digital screen. I hate you now,
Carmike.<br /><br />Leaving Inception, I was mostly fretting over the ending, not knowing
what it was that happened. I will have to get back to figuring that out
later. As for the rest of the movie, I can safely say I have never seen
a solid, mature movie like this. As one wonders if we leave our brains
at the door or bring it ready for action, don&#x27;t concern yourself. There
is absolutely something for all. Where thought seemingly is abandoned
and action takes over, we all know what happens when bullets fly...or
do we? Because of the varying levels of involvement, you have to
analyze the action and the possible consequences of it. Believe me,
consequences are always in the middle of the moment.<br /><br />Visually, I do not see how anyone can be disappointed. I do believe the
true adrenaline junkie will be disappointed, however. Despite the
amount of action, Inception, to be so truly admired, requires much
thought, and that&#x27;s a much appreciated positive concept these days.<br /><br />Personally, I am so thankful there are people like Nolan out there. He
convinced me that he cares about his creations. Inception is probably
one of the most completely respectable movies as far as I am concerned.
Nothing lacked except for one thing - the explanation for the ending. I
need more time to finish my thoughts on that. Everything else was
great. Acting, action, visuals, the cute musical allusion to one of the
best performers in Inception, the mystery, and the perplexing concept
of the story itself all come together as the key to true cinematic
success.<br /><br />You might think I would give it a 10 but because of the stymieing end,
I am going to be stubborn enough to give it a 9. Loved Inception and
thanks again Mr Nolan!
