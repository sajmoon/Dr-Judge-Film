1st) I do not consider my self to be dumb... but probably I lay under
that category &#x22;dumb people who think are intelligent&#x22;... (I don&#x27;t think
so, but okay...)<br /><br />2nd) This was one of the best movies I have ever seen... I was excited
and nervous throughout the entire movie...I was actually sad that it
was over, I would see it again today if I had lots of money and nothing
to do.<br /><br />3rd) I just want those people who rated this movie 1 star to think:
who&#x27;s wrong? You, or the other 40,000 people who loved this movie? This
is not a very hard question when there are 40,000 people who rated this
movie with 10 stars and 900 who rated with 1. <br /><br />I&#x27;m just saying.<br /><br />PS: By the way, for those who said that the special effects are bad....
My God... Are you sure we watched the same movie? I don&#x27;t think so. And
I&#x27;m not a fan of CGI. I watched it in the IMAX and I think it was very
worth it.
