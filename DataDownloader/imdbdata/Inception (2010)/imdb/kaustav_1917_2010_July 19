First thing first. Inception is the best English science-fiction film
ever no doubt. Christopher Nolan creates a world of multi layered
dreams that tests the audience at every step. While watching the movie
I felt that I was part of something really special. Go for it guys!! Do
yourself a favor, watch Inception. I am not going to describe the story
here as that is for you to find out. But will advise you that it is not
a film where you go with friends or girlfriend to have a party. You
have to watch very closely to get the flavor. Nolan has certainly
peaked and won&#x27;t ever make a better form of celluloid masterpiece. For
me it is no 1. And I am sure that most of my friends will agree to it.
The entire star-cast is also a winner along with the trillion dollar
script.
