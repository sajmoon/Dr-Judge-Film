This movie was mind blowing. I went to see this with very high
expectations and they were fulfilled this movie was just perfect in
every way. The story brilliant I mean how did Nolan even come up with
this. The special effects mind blowing. The complexity was not as bad
as I thought it would be. I mean this movie is fantastic I say you
should go see this movie now who cares if it is alittle complicated
just go see this movie. I have not seen to many good films this year
this movie and shutter island are my favorite so far this year. Clash
of the Titan very high expectations but I still liked that movie a lot.
The last airbender you know what people hated that movie. I liked it
even though it had the worst acting I have seen in a movie in god knows
how long. I am just saying there are not a lot of good movies right
now. You want a good movie either go buy shutter island or go see
Inception. Trust me Inception is a really good movie. Don&#x27;t miss out on
this movie.
