Interesting concept, and yet OK writing. Almost perfect casting, and
yet rather odd acting. Visually stunning, and yet not very exciting.
First of all, this movie is no Dark Knight, which is truly Nolan&#x27;s best
so far. It is also NOT The Matrix or Fight Club. The problem with the
movie is it started out very interesting and grabbing audience
attention right away, and yet with more and more detail being lay out,
you started to realize it is not really that big a deal, In the
theatre, as an audience sitting there watching people getting shot at
and as the intensity steadily going up, the movie gives nothing, no
fear, no pain, no emotion. Because all it is a dream. The worst
possible outcome, you go insane, like we are not already. The movie
lacks conflict which every good movie should have. Two, because the
movie is set in dreams, so realistically, there shouldn&#x27;t be too much
emotions which Nolan got it right. Yet for a movie, it is a disaster,
because without emotion there will be no feeling. Half way through the
movie, I really didn&#x27;t feel bad for Dom at all. His pain was like
fantasies. It was all in his dreams. Even his personal family
difficulty didn&#x27;t strike me as painful. In today&#x27;s global society, the
situation he was in was just unbelievable. Last, the ending. It just
doesn&#x27;t make sense. To be honest, I can&#x27;t even go into detail to
explain why it doesn&#x27;t make sense, but it just doesn&#x27;t. A movie is
still a movie. However, since Nolan can make a comic book movie
actually make sense, and even nominated for Oscar. I will forgive him
on this one. Either way, I recommend people to see it because it will
make you think about it. Any movie that makes us use even the smallest
amount of our brain is worthy of a viewing.
