I went to see this movie on the theater, based mostly on the reviews of
other users and of course the #3 spot on the Top#250 rank. Having said
that, I was expecting something brilliant, different and deep. After
all, being #3 means that you are a notch above &#x22;The good the bad and
the ugly&#x22;, &#x22;Schindler&#x27;s List&#x22;, &#x22;Cuckoo&#x27;s nest&#x22;, &#x22;Seven samurai&#x22; etc.<br /><br />I was somewhat disappointed. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the script is
brilliant and by all means different. However, between car chases and
gunfights on the snow, it left little room for us to see the real
acting (if any) of the cast. The idea behind this movie is amazing but
it could have deeper implications. Anyway, this is the last time I
choose to see a movie from it&#x27;s position in the Top 250. I should have
known better, since in the same top list you can find movies such as:
the &#x22;Star Wars&#x22; hexalogy, &#x22;Lord of the Rings&#x22; trilogy, &#x22;Raiders of the
Lost Ark&#x22; featuring at higher places from other movies such as &#x22;Citizen
Kane&#x22;, &#x22;Apocalypse Now&#x22;, &#x22;American History X&#x22; etc..<br /><br />Conclusion: Amazing inception :), but don&#x27;t be biased by it&#x27;s #3 rank
in the Top#250. [9 of 10]
