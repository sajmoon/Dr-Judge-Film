I couldn&#x27;t wait to watch this film but boy was it disappointing. It was
a fantastic idea and yes it looked great. However, the main problem for
me was that the characters were drawn so poorly in conjunction with the
visuals that I did not really care what happened to them. I loved
Momento and The Dark Knight but the crucial difference is that I cared
about Guy Pearce and Christian Bale. It may be perhaps that I do not
rate De Caprio but I could care less about what his predicament was. I
even tried watching it 3 times to see if I was missing anything but
ended up getting annoyed. Visually stunning there is no doubt and an
amazing concept but emotionally shallow.
