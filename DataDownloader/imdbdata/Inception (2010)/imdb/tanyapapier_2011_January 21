Let&#x27;s try to keep this simple:<br /><br />- Original concept - Great cast - Killer soundtrack - Stunning visuals
- Engrossing story<br /><br />The movie is one of the few blockbusters in the history of blockbusters
that carries an engrossing story based on elements (dreams) as widely
relevant to this many people and combines so many different themes (the
movie could be interpreted as a love story just as much as it could be
interpreted as an action flick). Add in slick execution and an ending
that will leave you wondering for weeks after and you&#x27;re left with a
movie that isn&#x27;t just the jack of all trades, but the KING.
