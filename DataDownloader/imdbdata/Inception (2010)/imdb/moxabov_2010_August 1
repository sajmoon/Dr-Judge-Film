A cool idea executed pretty well. People believe dreams are ways to let
your brain rest, recuperate, relearn. Some people even believe that
they tell you the future. But could they be used for ulterior motives?
By someone else? It is said that you should share your dreams. The
movie takes it to a whole new level. Or 3. Leaves us wondering if we
are ourselves in a dream. You need to have an ally to know. Wink, wink.
ME TOTally.<br /><br />But it does not stop there. How about it if besides learning from
shared dreams we could use them to actually change the future? The
concept is not unheard of, but here it is shown using technology
somewhat ala matrix. Elements of Stalker (1979) are also seen. So also
is a reflection of Douglas Hofstadter&#x27;s &#x27;Little Harmonic Labyrinth&#x27; (in
&#x27;Godel, Escher, Bach&#x27;, the conversation before Chapter 5). It is here
that the concept of Tumbolia is introduced (a land where cartoon
character live when no one is reading the cartoons). What is dreamland
if not a version of Tumbolia in some other space. How different is
limbo? The concept of GOD (=GOD Over Djinn) is also introduced there.
The name comes from Bach&#x27;s composition called &#x27;Kleines harmonisches
Labyrinth.&#x27; And labyrinths play an important role in the movie. It is
interesting that Penrose is mentioned in the movie but Godel and Escher
(and Bach) are not.<br /><br />But making a movie that seems sensible on such a topic is far from
easy. One thing I do not like in such movies though is that a lot
relies (in terms of making sense) on the first and last few minutes. I
am guilty of it myself in some short stories but in my defense they are
not feature length.<br /><br />What will happen if the inception of dreams fail? Can there be
time-like loops? Closed or open? What if it reverses? I would not want
to actually say what is in the movie so that I do not end up spoiling
it for you. I am sure you will enjoy it though.<br /><br />Oh, BTW, parts of the movie have been shot in Pasadena and LA.
