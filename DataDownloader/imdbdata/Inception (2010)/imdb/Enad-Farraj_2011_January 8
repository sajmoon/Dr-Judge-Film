There is a great deal of movies, not hundreds, but thousands of movies,
a lot of horror, drama, mystery, but only ONE Inception!!!<br /><br />From the beginning of the movie, you could feel its not a regular film,
not one of those high budget action movies that excites you by throwing
big explosions and gun shooting scenes like The Matrix or Die Hard.<br /><br />Not one of those where the actors did their roles perfectly but were
weakened by the screenplay&#x27;s in-competencies.<br /><br />Inception is perfect, a 148 mints movie that goes like 43 mints. as
soon as the film commences, you just cant BLINK!!! cant turn your head.
the acting, story, thrills, mystery, directing and soundtracks, all
congregate together to create a PERFECT MASTERPIECE called INCEPTION!!!<br /><br />If you haven&#x27;t watched it till now, go &#x26; rent or buy it, IT WILL CHANGE
YOUR PERSPECTIVES !!!!
