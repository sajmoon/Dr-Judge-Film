Sometimes it seems the Movie Critics as a group can be off. This is
clear when you take a look at the generally favourable overall review
Inception received from meta critic. True not a bad rating for a movie.
A masterpiece though? Shaw Shank Redemption, The Matrix, Dances with
Wolves and 2001 a Space Odessy, to name some other professional critic
messed up overall reviews when released in theatres.<br /><br />But enough of that. What makes Inception a masterpiece? Flawless
Entertainment. Before seeing the movie, I read some reviews about this
movie being flawed. Along with the hype and average good reviews from
professional movie critics. I did not expect much. Once the show ended
though I could not see what they were talking about. It was just to
much for most of them. This dose not make a film flawed.<br /><br />If you are able to focus in on a movie, you will enjoy this film. Its a
thinker. When you think just how complicated the scenes and story
direction just flows through and through till the end, but at the same
time still simple to understand and action packed through and through.
Well.... Flawless is the only words to describe this movie.<br /><br />This is one of the best films ever created. 10/10 For me. Watch it!
