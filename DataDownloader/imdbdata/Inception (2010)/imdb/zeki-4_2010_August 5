This was a visual treat. A full-blown action movie masked as some sort
of intelligent sci-fi. Lots of explosions and people shooting at each
other.<br /><br />But no real character development here. No memorable characters. Almost
no tension.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan was the guy who directed &#x27;Memento&#x27; and reinvented the
Batman-franchise, right? What happened here? Instead of sitting on the
edge I my seat, I found myself checking my watch. Not good.<br /><br />I expected more than just a lot of cool special effects and
Oscar-worthy production design. I expected a gripping story.<br /><br />I left the theater disappointed.
