Oh man this film wasn&#x27;t really that good and I&#x27;ll try to explain why
without giving anything away.<br /><br />Firstly let me just say that I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Christopher
Nolan, and whilst I&#x27;ve never particularly been a fan of Leonardo
DiCaprio his recent films particularly shutter island changed that view
and I&#x27;ve actually started to like him he&#x27;s surely grown as an actor
over the years, furthermore, there are other talented cast in there but
Joseph Gordon-Levitt I think was a bad choice for this movie he just
didn&#x27;t suit his role.<br /><br />OK now onto the actual film, the ideas were there, so was the budget
and the cast so were did it all go so wrong? With a mixture of the
directing and writing things got too deep and generally quite cryptic
that felt a little hacky at times. It&#x27;s not greatly structured nor does
it seem well thought out, I think they tried to put so many twists and
turns on the movie that it just wasn&#x27;t that enjoyable; I totally
understood it but the time they spent putting too many twists and turns
in it could and should have been spent using deeper character
development and general creativity opposed to just making things as
non-linear as possible.<br /><br />4/10 and that&#x27;s being generous
