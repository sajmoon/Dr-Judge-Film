There&#x27;s only one bad thing about this movie..<br /><br />When I watched the Trailer for this movie for the first time, I was
amazed about the awesome combination of video and music, but felt like
everything was kinda already revealed and there won&#x27;t be much
surprises. I was mistaken and happy about it. It&#x27;s a fantastic and
complex movie and it leaves you astonished. <br /><br />I&#x27;m starting with a top list of movies of all times, with some of them
being rated only average on IMDb, but it seems in this case everyone
else shares my opinion. It&#x27;s probably going to be in the Top 3 of my
list, it&#x27;s a masterpiece.<br /><br />There&#x27;s only one bad thing about this movie, the fact that it will take
a long time until I walk out of the cinema with such an amazing feeling
again : (
