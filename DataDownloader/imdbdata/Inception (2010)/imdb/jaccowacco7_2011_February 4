Chris Nolan has reached new heights. After Memento and the Dark knight
I didn&#x27;t think he could ever top is genius scripts and amazing
effects... but he has. He immediately makes the audience accept this
world of dream thieves. Leonardo Dicaprio plays Dom Cobb a man capable
of entering peoples minds through their dreams and stealing ideas. With
the help of his friend Arthur (Joseph Gordon Levitt) and an equally
talented team he is asked to plant an idea into a young mans mind hence
inception. This film displays possibly the most extraordinary and
realistic effects I&#x27;ve ever seen in film. You leave the film trying to
remember all the classic scenes, the best of which being Levitt
fighting in a room with no gravity, genius! Leo and Ellen Page are as
reliable as ever, Tom Hardy bring a great sense of humour whilst the
overlooked cillian Murphy brings a great sense of emotion, however it
is Joseph Gordon Levitt who excels as the completely serious, cool
right hand man. Next to Hardy he is one of the most exiting newcomers
at the moment. To sum up, perfect direction, great acting and a mind
blowing script. This is likely to be over looked at the Oscars but this
is a MUST-SEE and not a film i will be forgetting soon.
