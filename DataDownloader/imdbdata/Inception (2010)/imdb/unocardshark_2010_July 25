Yeah, I know Dreamscape relied on psychic phenomena in order to assist
the machines with hijacking dreams... but we all know where the
inspiration for this movie came from.<br /><br />This was very well directed, acted, etc. Make sure to use the restroom
as best you can before taking your seat as this movie could leave you
clueless if you were to miss 2-3 minutes of any scene.<br /><br />great movie. when compared to some of the best in the past year, I hate
to say it was better than shutter and eli, but it feels like I might
have to.<br /><br />Will DiCaprio be making any movies soon that do not contain a wife
(alive or deceased) haunting/stalking him?
