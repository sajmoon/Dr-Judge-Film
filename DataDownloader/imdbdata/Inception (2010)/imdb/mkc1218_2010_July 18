Inception?<br /><br />Incomprehension is more like it.<br /><br />Techno-babble, psycho-babble, and just plain babble fill a third of the
film, providing the audience with the rules of the game and the back
story of the main character. Unfortunately, much of it is unnecessary
and difficult to follow and takes the place of character interaction,
character growth, and emotion. Inception is a gargantuan, cinematic
meditation on dreams and reality. Zzzzzz. That&#x27;s the sound of me
snoring.<br /><br />The only thing worse than being bored at a film is being bored AND not
giving a crap. And that&#x27;s the case here. There&#x27;s not a single character
to care about. Oh sure there is a preponderance of cool effects, people
hanging weightless in time and space and climbing on ceilings, but
without a cohesive narrative or anyone to root for, they&#x27;re just pretty
images flashing on a big screen at a frenetic pace.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t get me wrong, somewhere there is a good film here. Or at least
there could have been. But as it stands it is a story not well told.<br /><br />Which is easier to explain: the plot of this film or the praise hefted
upon it by critics and everyone else on this forum? Has Christopher
Nolan risen to the level of Marty Scorsese and James Cameron where
films are lauded despite whatever self-indulgent, effects-laden dreck
they put on the screen?<br /><br />All throughout Inception I wanted to shoot myself so that I could wake
up from this bad movie. Unfortunately my top stopped spinning and the
reality set in: another lousy film in the Summer of 2010. Wake me when
it&#x27;s over.
