Well...have been sitting on reviewing a film since became a member of
this site...never was quite inspired to type away a few words for a
movie (I joined only in 2009, so don&#x27;t go, what about &#x22;The Dark Knight
already&#x22;, I love my movies alright..). But who to break that
melancholic joblessness for me but Chris Nolan. I wonder if there has
been a contemporary director more consistent than him at catering out
breathtaking cinematic experience, time and again. Well he is back
after two long years postponing the third batman movie for this one,
and we here thought &#x22;It better be good.&#x22; Well, we were wrong. Whats the
word, ah!!! &#x22;Ruddy brilliant it is!!&#x22; Nolan has once again got it all
right...the screenplay, the editing, the cinematography, phew!
breathtaking. His grip on the movie is so overpowering, that an actor
of DiCaprio&#x27;s talent, who by the way turns in an exquisite performance
as the troubled &#x22;extractor&#x22; Dom Cobb, still looks just another
character driven in a frenzy in a world only Nolan could make so
complex and yet so coherent with all its multi-&#x22;layered&#x22; texture. Ellen
Page and Gordon-Hewitt turn in good performances, while Michael Caine
is charming as ever in his short cameo, Because I am quite the
Cotillard fan, I would not comment on her performance, lest it be
biased. In short, if you have bought a ticket for this one, and I am
not counting on that being easy at least this weekend, even here in
Pune, you are in for a couple of hours of a hell of a ride. So long and
thanks for all the fish, Mr Nolan.
