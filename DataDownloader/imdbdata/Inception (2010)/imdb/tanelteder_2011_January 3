Christopher Nolan is a genius. After seeing this movie, you have to
admit it yourself. This guy does not only direct one the best films of
last decade but the thought that he even came up with such a screenplay
is gold itself. This is so money. The way the movie plays with your
mind is something new. Something different that people have ween
waiting for. And Nolan has absolutely delivered. The way he has used
time differentials is second to none. I couldn&#x27;t take my eyes off the
screen. I mind was confused because it didn&#x27;t know which clue to take.
There were so many opened strands that you could have picked any of it
and it would have amazed you.<br /><br />The cast is incredible. Leonardo DiCaprio is one the best around, he&#x27;s
never gonna disappoint you. Always brings in the best performance. The
supporting cast in front of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page and Ken
Watanabe were great. A very pleasant surprise was Tom Hardy.<br /><br />Inception is a must see. It gives dreams a new angle. Most of people
are fascinated, so am I. There&#x27;s a good chance you could be too. Take
that chance. Mind-blowing stuff!
