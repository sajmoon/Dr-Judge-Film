When seeing Batman Begins, I didn&#x27;t know what to come of it. I didn&#x27;t
know who Christopher Nolan was, what he could accomplish or what his
legacy would be. I just saw it as a movie, and when i saw it the first
time around- it was a little dark. Then i saw it again, and again, and
again. Until it became extraordinary every time i watched it. Then i
saw the Prestige. This time, little knowledge of Christopher Nolan,
only that he made Batman Begins and it was great. When i saw this one,
Christopher Nolan became one of my favorite directors, and the Prestige
ranking among my top ten films. Phenomenal. When preparing to see The
Dark Knight, i knew what i had in store. A wonderful director, a
fantastic film... what i got was much, much more. What i got was the
darkest, most wonderful, best movie I&#x27;ve ever seen. In the months to
come to Inception being released, i studied deeper into Nolan&#x27;s mind. I
saw Memento, again- mind-sweeping. And then... Inception. For a
filmmaker with so much hype, so much artistic ability, so much talent,
a film cannot be better. Inception is, and will be the best movie I&#x27;ve
ever seen (twice) until he outdoes himself again. Which I know he&#x27;s the
only person to do so.
