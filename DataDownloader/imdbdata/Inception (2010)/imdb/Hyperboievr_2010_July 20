Let&#x27;s say you go to a movie theater, and see a movie that you ended up
loving. How would you describe it? &#x22;Awesome?&#x22; &#x22;Spectacular?&#x22;
&#x22;Magnificent?&#x22; Christopher Nolan&#x27;s latest effort, Inception, is the
first time I honestly don&#x27;t think such words can do justice. Starting
smaller with sleeper hits such as Memento and Insomnia, the British
filmmaker worked his way up to bigger budget films such as the
critically praised Batman Begins, and its even more acclaimed sequel,
The Dark Knight. Seeing that The Dark Knight was the mega-blockbuster
Warner Brothers was hoping for, Nolan was given free reign for his next
movie. As it turns out, Inception is the man&#x27;s Holy Grail.<br /><br />If you are familiar with Christopher Nolan&#x27;s directing style, it may be
no surprise to find out that Inception is a twisted and unpredictable
film, albeit, twisted in the right way. The plot centers on Dom Cobb,
played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who is a skilled master in the art of
extraction. Extraction is the stealing of a person&#x27;s idea straight from
within their subconscious. This is done when a person is most
vulnerable, during their sleep. Through years of practice and
experience of infiltrating dreams, Cobb has reached a high level that
has also transformed him into a fugitive. He has been stripped away
from his family, but is offered a last job that could bring him back
home. His new task is not to steal another idea, but instead to do the
opposite. The new job is to implant an idea into a specific person&#x27;s
mind. The heist is underway after he assembles with the team of
characters in the movie.<br /><br />The ensemble cast of the team consists of wonderful performances from
Ellen Page, Ken Watanabe, Joseph-Gordon Levitt, and Tom Hardy. I will
not explore the plot more than I already have mainly because part of
the movie&#x27;s charm is the mystery surrounding the way the story
progresses. Inception&#x27;s plot is complex, but not impossible to figure
out and follow, as Nolan takes notice of certain limits when telling
the story. For example, the story mainly linear, as opposed to the
reversed storytelling style of Memento. The audience is also introduced
to the world of the dream through Ellen Page&#x27;s character. These aspects
of the plot make it accessible to every audience, without thinning out
the deeper layers of Nolan&#x27;s vision.<br /><br />Every performance was well-handled, with Leonardo DiCaprio&#x27;s
performance as the lead being the strongest. There is a certain level
of emotional pull in his character&#x27;s back-story, one that I will not
reveal here. What can be said about the acting in this movie is that it
is one of the many assets to this film that will keep you on the edge
of your seat. The amount of realism injected into each character makes
for a rather interesting conflict as the film picks up its pace.
Coupled with the beautiful cinematography and performances, the film&#x27;s
action scenes do not disappoint one bit. In fact, there is a certain
sequence in the film&#x27;s climax that is easily one of the most
jaw-dropping action sequences in all of action film history. I have not
been so thrilled since I first saw Neo dodge bullets in The Matrix. A
master like Christopher Nolan has the awesome ability to blend
high-octane action into a complex and layered premise so flawlessly.<br /><br />On a technical and artistic level, Inception delivers greatly. Every
shot in the movie seems so carefully placed, and at times the
cinematography, combined with clever use of slow-motion, greatly
enhances the experience during the more intense scenes. Composer Hans
Zimmer has created an immense score for this movie. The music is really
loud, yet fits with the tone being presented in the movie. As if the
music leapt right out of a giant monster movie, the booming brass cues
and somber piano fillers definitely help amplify every moment, from the
slower, more emotional moments to the absolutely epic action scenes.
The action that takes place in the dream world was made visually
possible thanks to really clever special effects. For a special effects
buff like me, this movie was a bit more of a treat. It seems that Nolan
tries to go out of his way to use as little computer generated imagery
as possible, and restricts it to when it&#x27;s needed. The film&#x27;s highlight
action moments are almost entirely achieved by practical special
effects, and that fact alone makes Inception stand out from the crowd
in today&#x27;s movie generation. As per Nolan tradition, the movie is
tightly edited; do expect some awesome hard cuts and seamless
transitions between the dream world and real world right before your
eyes. The really chaotic editing style gives the entire movie a very
surreal feel, almost as if you don&#x27;t know whether the characters are
dreaming or not. <br /><br />I can sit here for hours and hours, writing about the complexities and
curve-ball dialogue scattered within the plot, but I don&#x27;t want to be a
poor sport and ruin the film&#x27;s genius story for those who haven&#x27;t seen
it yet. Simply put, Inception is a masterpiece that will stand the test
of time. With a climax that is sure to become iconic, a deep and moving
emotional side, and powerful performances from realistically written
characters, Inception has it all. I tip my hat to Christopher Nolan for
envisioning such a fresh and engaging story, and his wonderful team for
making the perfect movie experience. Yes, I said perfect. Go ahead and
call me crazy, but this movie is absolutely flawless. It needs to be
seen by everybody on the face of this planet.
