We may all complain about dumbed down films nowadays, but this film has
blown up that charge quite spectacularly in this case for the defence.
Leo Di Caprio leads a team that can enter a person&#x27;s dreams &#x26; minds in
order to extract information. They are set a challenge to enter the
mind of a magnate&#x27;s son but this time to embed information and
instructions.<br /><br />Complicating the whole episode is the subconscious of Leo Di Caprio who
has to carry the heavy burden of his wife&#x27;s death (something we are
drip fed the details on through the film). The problem? She keeps
appearing and sabotaging his work in the dreamworld.<br /><br />Filmed &#x26; written by Christopher Nolan (of Dark Knight fame), this is
wonderfully handled. The story is a &#x22;riddle &#x26; puzzle wrapped in an
enigma&#x22;, and we are kept guessing and wondering about the machinations
of all that is happening. In truth, it can get overly clever and
requires some concentration, but it&#x27;s always worth the challenge and
effort. The viewer is always left wondering how the abstract ideas
piece together, and the complexity is part of the delight of this film.<br /><br />The film very much takes influences from various other sci-fi films, in
particular The Matrix and Existenz, but this does go its own way and
will be influential to many.<br /><br />The acting is generally very good. Leo Di Caprio is ably accompanied by
a good set of co-stars in this film as he leads. Most notably the
parallel puzzle of the dead wife is brilliantly portrayed by Marion
Cotillard. Cillian Murphy as one of the targets for Leo Di Caprio&#x27;s
team is as good as he always is.<br /><br />The filming is wonderful, and special effects quite dazzling. Folding
over landscapes and loss of gravity with floating characters give us a
real dream setting, and make you believe that is what is happening.
Some of the action work will still amaze even the hardened sci-fi or
action fanatic.<br /><br />Very much invigorates the thriller genre, and the pace will keep most
people intrigued throughout.<br /><br />A cerebral tale that will have you engrossed, and will definitely be
one we will most choose to view more than once.
