No. I could not help but think while I was watching this movie that
others in the audience were being challenged with the plot more than
me. An applause for the movie at the end simply stunned me. I believe
that this movie was made for a 13 year old&#x27;s intellect and if you are
surprised what is going on in the movie you just didn&#x27;t get it or
something.<br /><br />This is definitely the worst Di Caprio film I have seen (in a while.
ever?), which sucks because I thought his acting in this movie was very
good. The predictability of this movie was just too much for me. It was
something mixing the idea of a world within a world(i.e., Matrix
etc...)and the ridiculousness of a movie like &#x22;National Treasure 2.&#x22; I
suspended disbelief for this movie, but the plot was just extremely
transparent and unoriginal to me. There was too much worthless talk in
between action scenes, giving you too much information( A little less
talk and a lot more action)...<br /><br />I guess it will be hard for me to fight the 9.6/10 IMDb currently rates
this movie at, but I had to get this out there.
