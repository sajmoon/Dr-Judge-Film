This movie was very good. i knew from the start that it was going to be
a very good movie.. of course.... it&#x27;s christopher nolan. This movie
was confusing at times.... Especially the parts where they go from
dream to dream. But i liked the story and the effects of this movie. It
was well delivered.I also liked how all the actors fit in with their
characters. especially Leo Dicaprio and Ken Wanatabe and Joseph
Gordan-Levitt and Ellen Page and Marion Cotillard and Everyone!!!!
BUT... I HAVE TO SAY!!!!!!! WHY IS THIS #4!!! SURE IT IS GOOD BUT NOT
GOOD ENOUGH TO BE #4!!!!!!! Story: 9.5/10 Characters: 9/10 Effects:
9/10 Overall : 9.5/10
