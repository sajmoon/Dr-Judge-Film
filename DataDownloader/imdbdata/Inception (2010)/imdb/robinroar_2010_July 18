Hi to IMDb. This is my first review for any movie. I must say i watched
inception with high expectations after the dark knight. And guess what
it does? i can&#x27;t talk to anyone about it at home in India bcoz they&#x27;ll
beat the audience out of me. when i walked out of the theater i was so
amazed at the overall thrill and effect it had on me, sincerely i was
blown away. everyone else had a different opinion, what was common was
dream in dream crap, i sympathize with those who don&#x27;t want to use
their brains after buying the ticket with their hard earned money, but
hey at least have respect for those who dare to show something
original. Thank god i did&#x27;nt watched knight and day, even after more
than 90% of my friends recommended it to me. My final words would be
&#x22;If u are a movie fan, if u love movies n wanna watch a real summer
blockbuster, here it is.&#x22; (11/10), better than avatar!!
