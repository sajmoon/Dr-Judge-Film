Going into see Inception, I have to admit, my expectations were just
about as high as they&#x27;ve ever been. I try not to anticipate films too
much, so as to avoid disappointment, but with this one, I couldn&#x27;t
avoid it. My expectations were even higher than those I had for The
Dark Knight. <br /><br />I just finished watching not thirty minutes ago, and here&#x27;s how it
breaks down. I was instantly drawn into the world that Nolan has so
brilliantly created. Each time a new concept was introduced, I found
myself captivated by it. I&#x27;ve heard people recently compare this film
to Avatar. I have never heard such and erroneous comparison. The thing
that separates that two is that Avatar is based solely on its visual
effects. Things like that don&#x27;t amaze me. I am well aware of the
capabilities of today&#x27;s technology. What did amaze me about Inception
was not the visuals, it was the ideas. As the movie suggests, and idea
is the most powerful thing on earth. It is the greatest weapon mankind
possesses. Ideas have built and destroyed the greatest of nation
thousands of times over. The ideas in Inception are truly amazing. A
group of the 100 smartest people on earth could lock themselves in a
room for a year, together, and they still may not imagine so many
wonderful things. <br /><br />The first thirty minutes had only a few minor flaws. The next hour was
totally spectacular. The final hour dragged somewhat. Everything that
was happening was interesting, but it still dragged quite a lot. The
beauty of the film, though, is that even when it drags, the ideas
behind it never cease to amaze from start to finish. <br /><br />I believe a second viewing may be in order, just to nail down exactly
what I didn&#x27;t like. However, what I did love about it is and will
always be very clear. This is the most creative, imaginative, deeply
though out film I have ever witnessed. The ideas deserve more than a
10. It is a shame that a lack of knowledge of how to really use them
plagued the last hour. But, for all its flaws, its concepts are still
truly mind blowing.
