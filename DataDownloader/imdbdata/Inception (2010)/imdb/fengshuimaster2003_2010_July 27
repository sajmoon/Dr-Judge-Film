hi anyone care to explain to me the ending which i don&#x27;t understand, 1.
did Cobb make it out of the dream or is he trap inside forever? 2. did
he manage to save Saito? 3. what happen the the team after they finish
their mission? i really wish someone would answer my question i really
like the movie which i think is the best movie i have watch in 2010 not
even transformer and avatar can be a match for this movie but now i
look forward for the last air blender seem nice to me. Anyway anyone
watch predator, toy story 3 and the sorcerer apprentice already as i
have yet to watch them cant seem to find time for movie recently so
please comment for those movie as well thanks.
