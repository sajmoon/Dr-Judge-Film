Now This Is Reality.. After I saw the Cruise-Diaz duo&#x27;s unfortunately
unimpressive Knight and Day, I was disappointed. Really, I mean its Tom
Cruise, a careful actor who picks his roles with care, something went
wrong for him this time I guess; and to speak the truth, the film
didn&#x27;t turn out to be the expected &#x27;action-comedy&#x27;. But then came out
the &#x27;multi-level&#x27; dream project of Chris Nolan. A completely different
genre and, of course, everyone was indeed looking forward to it. I read
that he took around 8 years to formulate this masterpiece. &#x27;The Idea&#x27;,
that&#x27;s right the concept , was brilliantly structured, incorporating
logic and humanly experiences and though it was a bit complex, its
presentation was marvelous. Warner Bros. must have been delighted to
get back almost half of their budget in the opening week itself.<br /><br />Now talking about the movie, there are thoughts. Not much different
from the usual Sci-Fi flicks, you know, dealing with the mind and
future and stuffs like that. But Nolan&#x27;s version was a bit more
complicated. I&#x27;m not saying that that made the film bad, but that&#x27;s
what made it look different from the rest in its genre. DiCaprio, with
his style, has easily gelled into his character, Cobb. Not just him,
but everyone else in the film have done their parts really well. The
cinematography, not to mention, has always been outstanding in all
Nolan films. The Audio- Visual effects are not sky-high but they are
good enough. The storyline is quite interesting. As I said before it&#x27;s
the concept that&#x27;s a bit complicated and not the story. So you need to
have a tight grip on it, or else you might end up in a dream of your
own. Now, I don&#x27;t wish to give a full synopsis of the Inception right
here...Coz it&#x27;ll ruin your experience. My verdict...it&#x27;s worth watching
the movie in the cinema and it&#x27;s a &#x27;must watch&#x27;. And after you&#x27;ve
watched and if you&#x27;re not saying you were amazed by this movie, then
give yourself &#x27;the kick&#x27;. I&#x27;d give it a score somewhere around 8.5-9.
Surely it could be awarded with the title of the best Sci-Fi until now,
and it&#x27;s one of the best movies I&#x27;ve ever seen.
