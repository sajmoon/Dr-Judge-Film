Plz go and watch the movie. Thats all I can say. Plz go. This is a
masterpiece for centuries to come. Everything is perfect story,
cinematography, concepts, acting, action, comedy, direction..in fact I
ought to give it 100 out of 10 !<br /><br />Nolan has single-handedly shaken the legacy of Hitchcook, Kubrick,
Coppola, Scorcese and who not. Thanks to Inception, Nolan and Leo Di
Caprio are now officially immortal !<br /><br />This is a movie u can watch 4 times back to back without a break. And
still want more !<br /><br />Awesome movie. No other movie can live up to its standards ! 10/10
