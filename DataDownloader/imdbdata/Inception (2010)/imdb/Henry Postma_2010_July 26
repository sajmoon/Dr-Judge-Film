2010_July 26 
I went to see this film with very high expectations due to raving
reviews (Roger Ebert a.o.), but unfortunately it turned out to be
nothing more than an action flick with too much action and overdone
special effects. The story is about dream tapping, whereby people are
able to step into and figure in other people&#x27;s dreams. That is about as
&#x22;deep&#x22; as the film gets, no double layers (other than tapping into a
dream within a dream), no philosophical double doors or anything else
that could be slightly intellectually challenging for an educated
viewer. With the budget that was made available for this film (USD
160m) they should at least have hired a couple of professional writers
to make it work. Dialogues are very poor. At one point the girl, his
own apprentice, explains Leonardo DiCaprio in a panicky situation that
&#x22;it&#x27;s a projection, remember&#x22;, as if Leo&#x27;s character wouldn&#x27;t know
that. And why would a normal person&#x27;s (not a Navy Seal&#x27;s) subconscious
(in this case Robert Fischer&#x27;s) bring in dozens of guys with uzi&#x27;s etc
from all corners when under stress? It makes no sense at all. Without
all the special effects it could have been a much more powerful film,
despite the poor storyline. By far it does not stand up to a film like
The Sixth Sense (much less special effects, much more thrilling), or
even A Single Man with Colin Firth which I saw this same weekend. We
know that everybody dreams while sleeping, but the mystery of dreaming
has nothing to do with special effects or spectacular shootouts. When
we dream we touch on the unknown, and that is what creates the suspense
and mystery after we wake up. That Christopher Nolan, who apparently is
mesmerized by dreams or why else would he have written this nonsense,
did not touch on this but on the contrary just threw money at
ridiculous visual effects and bullet holes, is anybody&#x27;s guess. To me
this film is a demonstration of this director&#x27;s pretentiousness and his
creativity that only goes so far as blowing up stuff. I don&#x27;t
understand how some writers in serious newspapers can compare
Christopher Nolan to Stanley Kubrick. The score is 0 - 15. Luckily
Nolan is not 40 yet, so hopefully he will come back with something more
stimulating out of the money he will make from Inception.
