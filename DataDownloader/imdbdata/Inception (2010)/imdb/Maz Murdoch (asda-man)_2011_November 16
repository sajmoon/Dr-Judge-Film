I&#x27;ve regretted not seeing &#x22;Inception&#x22; on the big screen. I could&#x27;ve
seen it at my local cinema (lovely little place, and cheap too!) But I
suppose I didn&#x27;t bother to save hassle. Also, I didn&#x27;t quite realise
how much of a positive buzz this film was getting until after the
screening stopped (they only put films up for about two days, they&#x27;re
bloody ridiculous). By seeing this now only reinforces that regret,
because it would&#x27;ve been an absolutely stunning spectacle to see on a
fairly large screen with fairly loud sound. It would&#x27;ve left me even
more speechless.<br /><br />The biggest complaints without a doubt &#x22;Inception&#x22; receives are about
it being absolutely, completely and utterly confusing. Their is no
denying that &#x22;Inception&#x22; is probably the most confusing film I have
ever seen. Christopher Nolan throws you straight into the deep end with
his script and visuals, as Leonardo explains in the &#x22;simplest&#x22; terms
about what this dream manipulation malarkey is about. In a way you have
to sort of understand it for yourself which is sure to put some people
off, but please don&#x27;t let it. My parents gave up on it immediately as
it started, you must be willing to understand and actually want to
understand otherwise you will have absolutely no hope.<br /><br />I think that Christopher Nolan is an absolutely brilliant director and
writer. I&#x27;ve seen and loved &#x22;Insomnia&#x22;, &#x22;Batman Begins&#x22; and &#x22;Memento&#x22;
which have all required viewers participation (well mostly &#x22;Memento&#x22;)
they all show off his talent as a writer. &#x22;Inception&#x22; is probably not
only his biggest and most complex spectacle to date, but THE biggest
and most complex spectacle to date. I do not know how this came from
his mind, either he&#x27;s insane or a complete genius. I think that he&#x27;s a
complete genius as there&#x27;s no way anyone could ever think up such a
weave of ideas and present them in such a brilliant way of
story-telling. It&#x27;s impossible. Christopher is absolutely incredible.
So incredible that I don&#x27;t think that he even understood what he was
writing! It&#x27;s not only his writing but also his vision. It&#x27;s absolutely
gorgeous to look at with mind-blowing special effects that make you as
the viewer feel disorientated. The scene in which Paris folds over is
already one of the most iconic scenes in movie-making history and it&#x27;s
easy to see why. The special effects are just breath-taking. As is the
beautiful cinematography, shown off to dazzling effect in the &#x22;Hotel
level&#x22; and &#x22;Snow level&#x22;. &#x22;Inception&#x22; is the type of film that craves
the blu-ray quality it deserves.<br /><br />What sets &#x22;Inception&#x22; aside from other films is it&#x27;s sheer brilliance
in its writing. It is probably the cleverest film I&#x27;ve ever seen, with
the whole back story of Cobb and Mal that could be a whole separate
feature film in itself. It&#x27;s fascinating and left me completely
exhausted by the end of it, with an absolutely brilliant ending if I
might add! It leaves it up to the viewer and adds yet another layer of
mystery and confusion. The main plot concerns Leo and his team trying
to plant a thought into Cillian Murphey&#x27;s head, which some of it I
didn&#x27;t quite get but I got the gist to care about what was going on.
The music is also sensational aspect. It&#x27;s loud, proud and ultimately
adds a fantastical dimension to the film.<br /><br />&#x22;Inception&#x22; is an absolute masterpiece. It&#x27;s full of startling visuals,
ingenious twists and turns with one of the most original and daring
plots in decades. Did I understand it? No, did I care? No, not really,
I understood enough to care and was ultimately blown away. Like, &#x22;Black
Swan&#x22;, &#x22;Inside&#x22;, &#x22;Shutter Island&#x22; it left me breathless, in awe and
made me feel. Watch it. It&#x27;s worth it.
