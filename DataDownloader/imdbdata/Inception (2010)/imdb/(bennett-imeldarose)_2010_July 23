I thought the movie was absolutely horrible. It was truly a waste of
money. I tried to get my money back, but didn&#x27;t leave within 30 minutes
of the movie, so I had to sit through the retarded bizarre movie. Who
ever gave this four stars should be shot. If Leonardo could&#x27;ve read my
dreams while I fell asleep during the movie, he would not have been
flattered. Maybe I didn&#x27;t &#x22;get&#x22; the concept of the movie, but it was
annoying how they kept going from one dream to another dream, to skiing
and snow mobiles, then a van driving off a bridge, then to a guy
floating down a hallway, then to his wife and kids. All for corporate
espionage? Who cares about the company? I wish there was something
redeeming about the movie, but I couldn&#x27;t think of anything. We did
have a good laugh about how bad it was, so that should account for
something. If anyone reading this wants to pay me back the money I
wasted on the movie, I will gladly accept it! After the movie we went
to see Salt which I thought was excellent and very entertaining.
