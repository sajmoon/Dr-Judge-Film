First, I would like to say that the many many negative reviews are
correct in that, yes this movie is complex, multi-layered,
thought-provoking, open to interpretation, and it requires suspension
of disbelief. However, by the end of the movie, you will understand it,
and it will make more sense. It is also not intelligent, but rather
clever. And it all makes for one great movie. I mention the negative
reviews, because they kept me from watching it until recently. I was
highly intrigued by the idea, so I had to watch it anyway. I was not
disappointed.<br /><br />Now, for the more intelligent among you, you may figure it out before
the end, like I did. But, then I almost always do that. And, actually
the ending was not quite what I thought it would be, it was similar,
but better (if that&#x27;s possible) ! This is a movie that must be watched
at least once, trust me.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t want to give away any spoilers, there&#x27;s already plenty of those
around here, so that is all I will say.<br /><br />9/10, mostly because the acting could have been a bit better, and they
could have explained things a bit more clearly. I didn&#x27;t understand
what was going on until more than half-way through. It&#x27;s more like
9.5/10.
