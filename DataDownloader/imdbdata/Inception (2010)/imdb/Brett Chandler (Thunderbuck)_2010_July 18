There&#x27;s a lot to like about Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &#x22;Inception&#x22;. There&#x27;s
some thrilling action, some spectacular visuals, and some occasionally
clever dialogue. There&#x27;s also some problems with Christopher Nolan&#x27;s
&#x22;Inception&#x22;. The characters are mostly underwritten, the premise takes
some work to buy into, and it&#x27;s probably a good half-hour longer than
it should be.<br /><br />I liked it, with some effort, but I won&#x27;t think any less of you if you
don&#x27;t. There&#x27;s a fairly cool opening action sequence, but after that
the film descends into a good hour or so of exposition that bogs down
enough that it stands to alienate a good chunk of the audience.<br /><br />The biggest problem with the movie (aside from the mostly-flat
characters) is that the dream sequences aren&#x27;t particularly &#x22;dreamy&#x22;.
The odd strange thing happens, sure, but there&#x27;s a logic and structure
to these dreams that I&#x27;ve never encountered in my own personal dreams.
I was prepared to put a little work into my suspension of disbelief,
but those flat characters don&#x27;t make it any easier. This movie never
engaged me to the point where I forgot I was watching a movie.<br /><br />It isn&#x27;t a bad story, though. Nolan doesn&#x27;t leave any nagging loose
ends in his script, and if you&#x27;ve put in that effort to maintain your
own suspension of disbelief up to, say, the 80 minute mark, you will be
rewarded with a rather slick, multi-layered narrative and a pretty
satisfying ending. But if you don&#x27;t put in that effort, you&#x27;re likely
to find the whole thing to be kind of overwrought and tedious.<br /><br />As I say, I liked it, but it&#x27;s far from being Christopher Nolan&#x27;s
&#x22;masterpiece&#x22; as some critics have hailed it. &#x22;Memento&#x22; was smarter,
sharper, and infinitely more involving. And, yes, &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22; was
far more engaging, too.<br /><br />&#x22;Inception&#x22; is probably worth seeing in a theatre if only for the
visuals and the action sequences. Park your brain at the door, and try
not to expect too much, and you might stand a chance of liking it as
much as I did.
