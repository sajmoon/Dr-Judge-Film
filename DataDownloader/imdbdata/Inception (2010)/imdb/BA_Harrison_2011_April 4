At what point does a film become too complicated for its own good? In
the case of Inception, almost immediately: in a bid to make the
ultimate &#x27;mind-f**k&#x27; movie, writer/director Christopher Nolan starts
his film at &#x27;bloody confusing&#x27; and, over the course of 148
excruciatingly drawn-out minutes, works his way up to &#x27;completely and
utterly unfathomable&#x27; before leaving the film on a predictably
ambiguous note (thus allowing endless discussion on movie forums).<br /><br />Along the way, Nolan introduces many an intriguing idea, but the ones
that haven&#x27;t been nicked from far better movies (eXistenZ, Vanilla Sky,
The Matrix, Dark City, Cypher) are so half-baked that the film
inevitably becomes a frustrating mess of contradiction and contrivance
which conjures up an endless stream of questions (see IMDb&#x27;s FAQs),
none of which seem to have any satisfying answers (despite the best
efforts of Nolan&#x27;s rabid fan-boys).<br /><br />Lost in Inception&#x27;s labyrinthine plot, all I could do was sit back and
marvel at the special effects&#x97;which are undeniably impressive&#x97;whilst
asking myself repeatedly how Ariadne (Ellen Page) became such a great
architect despite no actual work experience, and whether such a pretty
young woman would really be happy to be sedated in a grubby warehouse
by a group of suspicious looking strangers. Somehow, I doubt it.<br /><br />5 out of 10 for its jaw-dropping effects (in particular, the awesome
gravity-defying fight scene), and I reckon that&#x27;s being generous.
