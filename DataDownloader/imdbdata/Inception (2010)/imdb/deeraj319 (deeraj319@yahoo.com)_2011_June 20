This movie is a true masterpiece. It has everything you could ever
want. The entire movie just stands out from all the others and is a
once in a lifetime movie that can&#x27;t ever be remade. The screenplay was
absolutely amazing and Christopher Nolan is an absolute genius. Hans
Zimmer did a wonderful job on the music too! This is a movie that I
recommend for everyone. No matter what, you will be touched by this
movie and moved. Though, you might have trouble understanding it at
parts because it is quite complex sometimes. The concept of Inception
is truly interesting and is ,once again, very complex at times.
Overall, this movie is truly amazing and it honestly should have one
every award it was nominated for. No other movie adds up or even comes
close to this one.
