I just had the great pleasure of watching Inception and it confirmed
some things that I think I&#x27;ve known all along: 1) Christopher Nolan is
insanely creative and a freaking genius, and 2)Leonardo DiCaprio is an
incredibly good actor.<br /><br />In a world of creative derivatives, I haven&#x27;t enjoyed a movie this much
since, well, Avatar. And there was a long stretch in the last 15 years,
where I just didn&#x27;t like anything with the possible exception of
Memento and Gangs of New York.<br /><br />I&#x27;m going to wait a bit before I see it again to hopefully understand
some of the stuff that eluded my tiny brain. I&#x27;m sure it will be well
worth it.
