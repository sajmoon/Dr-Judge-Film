I enjoy the fact that Inception arrives with some fairly good ideas to
it and isn&#x27;t afraid to have a little fun with them; when several
characters are in a deep sleep inside of a moving minivan, which is
being chased by would-be mercenaries armed to the teeth and wholly
taking advantage of that fact, they are thrown around and thrust about
inside of the collective world of their slumbers as if an earthquake
were happening therein &#x96; all because of the grief their unconscious
bodies suffer in &#x22;reality&#x22;. The film is close to all but full of little
instances such as these, the bulk of them more interesting that any
sort of narrative the writer/director of the piece Christopher Nolan
has going on; as indeed are they a great deal more than any sort of
attention to character the film has unfolding within it beyond that of
its lead&#x27;s. There is a nagging feeling throughout Inception that
somewhere along the line, an original idea mutated into an assembly
line actioner; when it&#x27;s established that anonymous gunmen turn up to
fire upon the lead characters having entering somebody&#x27;s state of
sleeping, it is explained they are the subconscious reacting negatively
to intruders within the person&#x27;s mind: neat idea. By the time we&#x27;re all
storming an isolated dream-scape base drenched in Arctic conditions,
guns blazing whilst engaging with those gunmen, it&#x27;s veered away from
its smart foundations and become a snow-set Call of Duty level. <br /><br />Inception&#x27;s lead is a certain Dom Cobb, played effectively by Leonardo
DiCaprio; a man occupying an unspecified future not too dissimilar to
that of our own present but which happens to house an invention capable
of entering that of a human-being&#x27;s dream. We begin in the present, the
film essentially one long flashback; we see Cobb washed up on a heavily
guarded island beach rife with Japanese iconography before taken to
meet an elderly man whom reacts to seeing him. When we dart back to
before they would have first met, we observe Cobb standing in stark
contrast to that of when we saw him during the opening; Cobb here is
smart and well dressed and is far better shape; the ability to identify
specific British artists of-old when observing a painting at a function
suggesting degrees of sophistication in that regard. Inside, Cobb is a
troubled man; his dead wife, who&#x27;s fittingly named Mal &#x96; incidentally
the French word for &#x22;bad&#x22;, here played by the French actress Marion
Cotillard, weaves in and out of his own mind causing havoc in a fairly
unique way as he strives to get home to his two young children whom he
has not seen in years. The truth with Mal looms over proceedings
impressively.<br /><br />His field is that of essentially thieving, Cobb&#x27;s crucial piece of kit
to his line of work a series of pipes and tubes linked to a machine
small enough to fit into a briefcase complete with its own
infrastructure and framework; an invention enabling one to connect it
to another human and enter their dreams. We have to latch onto things
quickly in this regard; the film does not much pause for thought as
this utensil is used as it is &#x96; it is established to exist; it is
established people use it and are familiar with it and we must catch
on. Cobb is approached by a rich Japanese businessman named Saito
(Watanabe), his idea on this, Cobb&#x27;s retirement time, to do the
seemingly impossible and achieve &#x22;Inception&#x22;; the placing of a memory
or psychological item into that of a person&#x27;s dream, in this case to
make Cillinan Murphy&#x27;s Robert Fischer, son of a dying billionaire,
think he should divide the company up and do all manner of wrongfulness
to benefit Saito. Bruce Willis&#x27; immortal line to Hans Gruber nearer the
end of the first Die Hard seeing him exclaim to us precisely where he
stands upon realising everything that had just transpired was,
essentially, so as to steal something at this point rearing its head. <br /><br />The film covers, to varying degrees of interest, Cobb&#x27;s employment of a
team to do the never before attempted. His first is Eames, (Hardy) an
ice-cool Brit. whom dwells in the hostile surroundings of African
township casinos whom shares some, but not enough, amusing antagonism
with Cobb&#x27;s lifetime work partner in Gordon-Levitt&#x27;s Arthur. In
addition to proceedings, Ellen Page&#x27;s young Architect Ariadne, whose
role it is to literally construct the dream-scape, sees Page lumped
with the role of the newbie to the proceedings &#x96; a role which we very
much map onto ourselves in this regard as she asks all the questions
and needs most things explained to her in the manner we do. <br /><br />Strip away most of the exterior and Inception is a relatively
simplistic film; like Gilliam&#x27;s troubled movie of six months earlier in
The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, although not as enjoyable, the
premise is fairly condensed, if routine, and is near-enough embedded
within the realms of straight forward genre &#x96; right down to the crew of
guys sitting in a warehouse around whiteboards housing plans as they
knock around ideas. The kick being that both projects have this wildly
inventive item or core idea at the very centre of them, something which
cannot help but demand creativity and incident along side dramatic
content inducing the odd bout of awe on top of what might be at its
heart a very simple story about a love triangle or an affluent but
corrupt individual going to a man for one last job and asking him to do
&#x22;x&#x22; and &#x22;y&#x22; . The film is a sharp, if ultimately overly long, but
engaging science-fiction with enough action and familiarised photogenic
stars in it so as to draw in the mainstream crowds in that regard; not
to sound too dismissive, the film has its merits and its triumphs and
is impressively reigned in by its creator but is far from dreamy.
