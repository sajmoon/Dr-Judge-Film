Strong performances across the board, from Christopher Nolan&#x27;s
direction, to the actors, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt shines...there are
LOTS OF EXPLANATIONS...how the dream levels work, expansion of time,
construction of dreamscapes, yadda yadda yadda...the effects are top
notch but I&#x27;m not much of a fan of &#x22;dream&#x22; movies...something weird
happens and someone wakes up...and then I&#x27;ll realize that &#x22;oh
yeah....the guy was just having a dream....&#x22; ...and Bobby Ewing WASN&#x27;T
REALLY KILLED !....grrrrr ......read &#x22;deus ex machina&#x22;.....all in all
it was pretty good, though....and I&#x27;ll rent it and see it again just to
enjoy the enjoyable aspects of it....but I DON&#x27;T agree that it is the
masterpiece that it has been rated to be.....so I woke up this morning
and wondered if I had really gone to the movies last night to see
&#x22;Inception&#x22;...and I grabbed my little toy and realized that I WAS awake
and I HAD NOT really seen it....but then, I REALLY woke up and realized
that I had........MAYBE.....
