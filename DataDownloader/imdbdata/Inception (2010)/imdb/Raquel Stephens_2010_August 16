Not only is Leonardo DiCaprio one of the sexiest men alive, but the
co-roles such as Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt proved to be very
vital to the overall aspect of the movie. Inception takes what you
know, makes you think about it, and then causes you to leave the
theatre asking &#x22;What the hell did I just watch?&#x22; Not going to reveal
any spoilers, but walking away, and I mean within 2 minutes of the film
ending, most of the audience walked away upset. However the acting,
action, plot and lingering question cause it to be one of the greatest
movies possibly created. It makes you think to say the least, and if
you&#x27;re into that kind of thing, GO SEE THIS MOVIE. There is no reason
to not see this movie and when anybody asks me, I instantly say, &#x22;Go
see Inception.&#x22; Why? Because not only is it IMDb&#x27;s top 3rd highest
voted movie but because in combination of everything that makes this
movie whole, all I can say was... It was the perfect movie.
