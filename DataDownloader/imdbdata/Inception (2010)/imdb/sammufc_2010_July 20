In the aftermath of The Dark Knight (2008)&#x27;s gargantuan commercial and
critical success, there was a scepticism that hovered over its
director. Christopher Nolan was the pioneer of multiple narratives
playing out before converging, with the rug being pulled from under the
feet of his audience come the finale. Yet these hallmarks were absent
in The Dark Knight: complex-free (relatively) sans flashbacks and
multiple narratives. Had Nolan sold out? He had certainly become a
directorial brand. Relief for his ardent aficionados and film purists
then, that Inception is the quintessentially distinguishable Nolan
&#x27;comeback&#x27;.<br /><br />Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), riddled with guilt over his wife Mal
(Marion Cotillard)&#x27;s death, is offered redemption by Ken Watanabe&#x27;s
businessman- with his culpability in Mal&#x27;s death extinguished-if he can
plant &#x27;Inception&#x27; in the mind of corporate rival Cillian Murphy. The
predicament is that Inception is the opposite to the art of extraction
Cobb excels in, and doubts linger whether it can be done.<br /><br />Cobb is the classic Nolan protagonist: obsessive, aloof and suffering
from familial loss, establishing his personality in the opening twenty
minutes is the reassuring tonic that Nolan hasn&#x27;t defected from his
complex film writing roots. Complemented by a failed extraction Cobb
and point man Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) participate in, it&#x27;s an
informative arc which segues onto the beginning of Cobb&#x27;s purported
last job. It&#x27;s a familiar premise in a different genre for Nolan, yet
the emotionality which is recurrently engineered struggles to hold as
the crux of proceedings. When Cobb recites to architect Ariadne (Ellen
Page) the coming of his wife&#x27;s demise-aided by Hans Zimmer&#x27;s versatile
score- it&#x27;s a rare occasion of feeling allotted to anyone in Inception.
Because it&#x27;s forever subordinated by the heist which takes, get this,
within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream. It&#x27;s the
first occasion Nolan has struggled with allowing a film&#x27;s emotion to
fall into the background, the absence of his brother Jonathan on screen
writing duties should not be underestimated.<br /><br />Those who have seen DiCaprio in Shutter Island will be hampered by the
timing and familiarity of Martin Scorsese&#x27;s B-Movie homage as much as
Nolan&#x27;s project, the outpouring of sympathy occasionally weeps rather
than gushes. And while DiCaprio&#x27;s performance is competent, he is
outclassed by nonchalantly joyful character acting from Tom Hardy and
the dapper Gordon-Levitt; the pair&#x27;s ying-yang chemistry enhancing
their respective performances.<br /><br />Enshrouded in mystery since it&#x27;s, well, inception, Nolan&#x27;s innovation
remains visually stunning and refreshing amidst another summer of
abject failures. Chase sequences through Mombassa, gravity-free hallway
fights, carnage in LA and a mountain firefight are heart-pumping
sequences choreographed thrillingly. The irony is that such moments
could have been rendered expendable for a better film, for Inception
isn&#x27;t as complicated as had been mooted by Warner Bros. The
inevitability which exists within Nolan&#x27;s dream scape is incongruous
for one of his film&#x27;s, and the ultra-cerebral viewer, while in awe of
the premise, may be yearning for the rug pulling trick Nolan excels at.<br /><br />Curiously, there&#x27;s no outstanding antagonist. Watanabe is billed as the
blackmailer, yet his benign manner and Saito&#x27;s development vanquishes
the prospect of any animosity, which is reserved for the wreaking ghost
of Mal in Cobb&#x27;s dreams. More crucially though, it subsides the rooting
factor that the film attempts to engineer.<br /><br />For all its imperfections though, Inception is an enjoyable,
grand-scale blockbuster which deals in the cerebral and thrilling,
albeit not in equal measure. The contractually obliged addition to
future projects is that Christopher always be paired with Jonathan
indefinitely, and then you have the dream double-act.
