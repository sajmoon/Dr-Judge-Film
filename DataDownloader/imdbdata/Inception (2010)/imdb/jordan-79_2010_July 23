This movie is over-rated. It is hard to follow, not just because some
of the dialogue is very difficult to hear but because it is,
purposefully, inherently confusing. I don&#x27;t like to have to work quite
as hard as I did in the beginning of this movie to be able to enjoy it.<br /><br />Also, I didn&#x27;t really care about the characters. The type of
&#x22;craziness&#x22; that Leonardo&#x27;s character suffers from has been gone over
time after time in movies, and I didn&#x27;t find anything particularly
compelling about Leo or the other characters. I want to deeply bond
with the characters, and I didn&#x27;t really do that in this movie.<br /><br />The visuals were truly stunning. And they do kind of wrap up everything
by the very end. But in my view this movie is not nearly as good as
everyone is making it out to be.
