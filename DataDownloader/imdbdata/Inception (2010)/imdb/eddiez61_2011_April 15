It takes its own sweet time setting up the intricate (absurd) plot and
detailing much of the back story, spending an awful lot of time
explaining itself as people go on and on reciting the rules and logic
and pitfalls of dream invasion. I often found myself murmuring &#x22;Yes,
yes, I get it.&#x22; So many words - so many ideas - unnecessarily spoken.
But this slightly overlong odyssey is charged with scenes of superior
creativity. Sprawling between the static, verbose moments are genuinely
spectacular episodes of stunning hyper-surreal imagination. The grand
visual effects are so fluid and organic. The real world is entirely
subsumed in this fantastical universe of spellbinding vistas and jaw
dropping action, all marvelously animated by some deeply disorienting
physics. <br /><br />I was often impatient with the movie, cursing the intermittent scenes
of tedious exposition, but what stays with me, however, hauntingly, is
a genuine sense of awe. I feel like I&#x27;ve been through a harrowing
experience, much more challenging and treacherous than the all the
media hype had prepared me for. I had watched its TV commercials
convinced that it would be relying entirely on computer generated
effects for all its allure. But it turns out the clever concepts that
drive the action are captivating as well. I&#x27;ve spent quite a few idle
moments reflecting on the perplexing notion of multiple layered dreams,
pondering the interplay of the relative time-space of each layer. The
old tired clich&#xE9; of a dream within a dream is here entirely
deconstructed and exploded into a bewildering symphony of synchronized
chaos. <br /><br />Chaos is an ingredient, for sure, and for so many viewers, the defining
one. They have found the story to be too randomly illogical and
ponderously convoluted. What&#x27;s so funny about this reaction is that
it&#x27;s possible ONLY if you expected this farcical tale to to be anything
else but purely ridiculous. For me the only way to receive the crass,
dreary product that Hollywood regularly excretes on us is to accept it
ironically, sarcastically. It&#x27;s just as much fun to not only laugh
along with the somewhat humorous shenanigans, but to also laugh AT the
contrived crap - a full throated, hearty roar of mocking contempt. I
take my yucks wherever I can get &#x27;em. So, armed with this snide
attitude, a movie just isn&#x27;t able to &#x22;let me down.&#x22; I always find
something to enjoy, even if it means taking pleasure in despising it.
Got that? Good. I didn&#x27;t expect Inception to change my world, or even
worse, to support my pitifully puny version of life&#x27;s meaning. That
seems to be most people&#x27;s expectation of movies, to have their own
major and minor delusions validated. Go figure...<br /><br />Leonardo is riveting, as always, and does his utmost best with the
often cumbersome script. As tortuously explicit as the dialog gets, Leo
manages to sustain a convincing and compelling character. Ellen Page
strikes a nice balance of innocent wonder and precocious arrogance. She
reminds me a lot of Jeneane Garofalo, but cuter and not as smug. Joseph
Gordon-Levitt has the look and composure of a classic Hollywood star,
but the talent of a veteran character actor; a real pleasure to watch
him work. And there are a few heavyweights filling out the cast
including a barely recognizable, substantial Tom Berenger, and also the
usually sublime Ken Watanabe, who is partially wasted here in a minimal
role. Michael Caine&#x27;s elegant appearances bookend the film, anchoring
the whole fanciful, capricious event. His regal presence lends gravitas
to any production.<br /><br />As obtuse and self satisfied as Inception is I have found that there
are few films that have taken such complete advantage of the film
medium. I can only think of three or four other movies that have
stunned me more. One of them, of course, is Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 2001: A
space Odyssey from 1968, and another is David Lynch&#x27;s Inland Empire
from 2006, which has taken the art of cinema to an unprecedented level,
employing absolutely no computer generated effects but achieving what
is, for me, one of the most intense, profound, mind and soul shattering
cinematic experience of my life. It&#x27;s indescribably remarkable. The
Matrix, in case you&#x27;re wondering, is not one of the others. HA! That
steaming heap of ox dung is remarkable only for its mind numbing
stupidity. But Inception, in spite of its verbal excesses, is extreme
good fun. 7.5/10
