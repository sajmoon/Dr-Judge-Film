Contrary to the opinions of the deluded army of comic reading Nolan
fanboy geeks who have descended on IMDb, Christopher Nolan has entirely
and irrevocably disappeared up his own self inflated backside with this
movie. I say The Emperors New Clothes because the director will sneer
at anyone who doesn&#x27;t understand the film and he has thus created a
perfect defence mechanism. I&#x27;m sure Di Caprio et al had in depth
briefings about the narrative and can explain it verbatim but us
viewers are left to work it out for ourselves. And it&#x27;s so full of
holes, so full of irrelevant tripe and so full of itself that it isn&#x27;t
easy. It&#x27;s incredible that its been voted the 3rd best film of all time
by IMDb users. I mean seriously, that&#x27;s a joke. The fanboys all want to
laud Nolan as the new Kubrick (another joke) but in doing so they have
voted this tosh above ALL of Kubricks work. It&#x27;s such a smug self
congratulatory film from the get go and it just gets smugger as time
drags on.<br /><br />Now of course I appreciate that you can go too far in explaining every
detail to the viewer with unnecessary script mechanics that insult the
viewers intelligence. However, although you can go too far in
explaining, you can also go too far in NOT explaining and expect the
viewer to grasp in a single viewing what is a massively complex concept
film - and one that&#x27;s so badly flawed in so many areas for it to
undermine the whole &#x27;intellectual&#x27; nature of it. The idea of the film
is OK and the film does have its moments but there are so many scenes
that don&#x27;t make sense that it spoils it entirely. I appreciate that
&#x27;heist&#x27; movies are usually procedural and that Nolan wanted to avoid
that but in doing so he&#x27;s created the most self-indulgent picture ever.<br /><br />I could go on about the snow scene, the thoroughly implausible way
these people not only do what they do but &#x27;assemble&#x27; as a team, the
oh-I&#x27;m-Christoper-so-considerably-cleverer-than-you-are-Nolan backstory
with Di Caprio&#x27;s wife but I&#x27;m not going to pick apart the scenes
because I&#x27;d be here for hours and I haven&#x27;t got the energy left after
enduring this nonsense. Besides; everything could be spun that he meant
this or that (he isn&#x27;t as deep as he likes you to think). Inception is
all fur coat and no knickers. It explains so little of what is going on
that I left feeling angry. And I generally get these films so it&#x27;s not
a case of me being some moronic fool who struggles to follow the
weather. <br /><br />And billed as a completely original idea? Nah. There&#x27;s obvious
similarities with The Matrix, Dreamscape, Total Recall, Flatliners,
Vanilla Sky, Pan&#x27;s Labyrinth, Dream Demon and even one of the Star Trek
Next Generation Episodes centred around the holodeck, all of which I&#x27;ve
&#x27;gotten&#x27; - the good ones, the bad ones, the ones you ponder for days
afterwards. The fact is with this abomination I simply can&#x27;t be
bothered to think about it because I really don&#x27;t care. I don&#x27;t care
about the characters, I don&#x27;t care about the ending (which was
excruciatingly predictable) and I don&#x27;t care about how clever Nolan
thinks he is. You&#x27;re not mate. You&#x27;ve pulled a massive con with this
film by creating a movie where you can call people stupid if they don&#x27;t
get it / like it. You get to sneer and snigger at the stupid little
people. You&#x27;ve taken your previous successes to the movie execs and
they&#x27;ve foolishly allowed themselves to fund your rampant self
indulgence. That&#x27;s what irritates me the most about this utter piffle.
I understood what was understandable about this film and there are of
course films where the intention is to purposely let the viewer fill in
the gaps with their own imagination (generally a nice touch) but that
simply isn&#x27;t the case here. The story script and indeed most of the
awful acting (outside of Di Caprio, Juno girl and Cillian Murphy)
neither holds it together nor papers over the cracks of a weak script
that&#x27;s trying to be oh so deep... and badly failing.<br /><br />This is over 120 minutes of my life that I will never ever get back and
I simply couldn&#x27;t wait for the film to end. I had lost all interest in
any of the characters, their backstorys or indeed the &#x27;mission&#x27; after
an hour once I woke up to the fact that he was clearly unable to pull
the film together into something coherent and genuinely contemplative.
And judging by the rest of the audience and the people I was with, I
wasn&#x27;t the only person who left feeling bitterly cheated. I
congratulate Nolan on creating hysteria, mass hypnosis and hype because
he&#x27;s clearly managed to brainwash a lot of the audience into making
them think they&#x27;ve seen a clever film. That&#x27;s the only inception.<br /><br />Go and see this insidious fluff for a visual experience perhaps (even
then; visually it&#x27;s pretty overrated). But don&#x27;t be surprised if you
feel a strange peer group pressure to tell whoever you go to see it
with that you understood it all when you probably didn&#x27;t (or if you
did; that you actually care and did so in spite of a dumb script).<br /><br />Nolan is not nor ever will be Kubrick. Kubrick would have done this
film justice - after he had rewritten the script, changed half the
cast, removed 45 minutes of length and replaced it with sensible
content that made the film engaging and cohesive. I fear the next set
of people to be duped will be those who vote for this trite idiocy come
the Oscars.<br /><br />BTW I wager that Nolan watched Guy Ritchies Revolver and liked it.
Congratulations Christopher, you have just descended to his level of
filmmaking.<br /><br />Meh.
