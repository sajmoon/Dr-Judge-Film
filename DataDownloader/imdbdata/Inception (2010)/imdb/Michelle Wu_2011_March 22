I personally enjoy the plot of love adventure very much. Merely the
background of the movie, love adventure of the main character, Dom and
his wife, Mal, made the audience brood over the meaning of dreams and
ideal in a love relationship. In a relationship, women always get
obsessed with the imagination just like all the scenes Mal and Dom
could create together in the dream. Through Inception, it gave me the
insight that in the relationship we could easily lose ourselves. It
needs us to be more self-disciplined about being in love and
maintaining the daily life. After all, the dream that one can stay with
your loved ones forever is always seductive enough to let someone
abandon sense, refuse to wake up. In the movie, I again see that love
is suffering.<br /><br />However, I ended up screaming in the theater with my friends. ;D &#x22;It
ends? It&#x27;s awesome!&#x22;
