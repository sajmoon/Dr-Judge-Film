I was trying my best to keep from falling asleep. What purports to be a
breakthrough film about dreams, turned out to be a first-rate,
high-budget snooze fest. The writer couldn&#x27;t decide, I suppose, whether
he wanted to do a James Bond movie or the Matrix or the Thirteen Floor.
Leo Dicapprio&#x27;s character is insipid. Ellen Page&#x27;s character is two
sentences short of a paragraph. Everyone else was unmemorable. I
couldn&#x27;t care less if anyone lived or died. Nothing really made much
sense. And don&#x27;t get me wrong, I absolutely loved the Thirteenth Floor
and the Matrix (though the sequels were blech!). Christopher Nolan did
a great job with Memento and Batman Begins and the Dark Knight, but
OMG, what was everyone thinking? Apparently, I, too, am in a nightmare,
looking at the great reviews. And while the special effects were
eye-catching, they were not mind boggling. Two clenched fists for this
one. Methinks now, I&#x27;ll just go and watch Green Lantern and do myself
in.
