2010_July 26 
I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m a bit confused. I saw &#x22;Inception&#x22; last night. I had high
expectations based on miles of positive ink from reviewers and
professional critics, all tripping over themselves to bestow demigod
status upon Christopher Nolan. These expectations were dashed to bits
within the first thirty minutes of the film, and turned to a kind of
dread as I realized what folks these days will accept as &#x22;depth&#x22; in
their entertainment. I wish I&#x27;d never seen those gushing reviews, I
would&#x27;ve enjoyed the film much more. <br /><br />Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m a fan of Christopher Nolan&#x27;s Batman
reboots &#x22;Batman Begins&#x22; and &#x22;The Dark Knight.&#x22; For my money, those were
without a doubt the second and third most effective superhero movies to
date (sorry, Raimi wins.) The man certainly knows how to keep a story
moving along, and he knows how to film action. In the case of The Dark
Knight, Heath Ledger provided an emotional lynchpin non-pareil in his
Joker portrait, and Nolan milked it for all it was worth. There was
real pathos and genuine mortal horror built into the foundation of the
film&#x27;s impressive structure. Also, the fact that it was based on a
comic book lowered the bar and allowed the audience to suspend just
enough disbelief to allow most of the dorky plot elements to slip
through and do their work. <br /><br />Now let&#x27;s discuss obvious comparisons to an earlier effort in this
vein&#x97;that is, an action movie dolled up to the nines as philosophical
treatise. I&#x27;ll admit that I was never a fan of The Matrix. I thought it
was asinine in conception and brutish in execution, even as I admired
some of the visual effects and spectacular stunt work. Comparing The
Matrix&#x27;s ridiculous endless &#x22;stream-of-consciousness&#x22; gibberish about
free will with, say, Roy Batty&#x27;s laconic final soliloquy in Blade
Runner, is like comparing the Twilight series&#x27; moronic teen romantic
angst with David Foster Wallace. Unfortunately, Inception had precisely
the same effect on me, which is to say very little. <br /><br />Here we find the great and terrible Nolan exploring the tired territory
already plundered in countless films of yore, including Hitchcock&#x27;s
Spellbound and 1980&#x27;s genre pics such as Brain Storm, The Dead Zone,
and Dreamscape. The basic premise reads like a dime store sci-fi
novel&#x27;s back cover: &#x22;In the future, we can enter into each other&#x27;s
dreams! Feel the magic of dreams, within dreams, within dreams!
Experience the thrill and wonder of miraculous &#x22;Dream Time&#x99;.&#x22; Oh Boy!&#x22;
Within twenty minutes of the film&#x27;s somewhat intriguing intro, I knew
not only how it would end&#x97;I also pretty much knew how we were getting
there. Nolan plays primarily to the back row, and&#x97;no offense,
America&#x97;but we&#x27;ve been slightly dumbed down over the past few decades,
and we&#x27;re much easier as a whole to entertain than we used to be. Look
back at a few films of the past with vast, labyrinthine plot structures
like Hawk and Faulkner&#x27;s &#x22;The Big Sleep&#x22;, or practically anything by
the Coen Brothers. What&#x27;s defines their deep-impact gravitas, as
opposed to the flat and diffuse emotional landscape of Inception? It&#x27;s
character development, pure and simple. In this case, Nolan didn&#x27;t have
a single character &#x97;especially the one played with typically earnest
gusto by Leo Dicaprio&#x97;with a plausibly human fatal flaw, foible, or
reason for doing&#x85; uh, whatever it was he was doing. We&#x27;re simply
dropped into an alternate universe with rules seemingly invented to
favor nerds of any stripe &#x97;almost impossibly similar to the one in The
Matrix&#x97;and told to hold onto our hats, because here&#x85; we&#x85; go! Except
we&#x27;re not actually GOING anywhere, or at least not anywhere we haven&#x27;t
been a thousand times before. <br /><br />Sorry to rain on the parade of everyone that&#x27;s ready to lionize C.
Nolan as the great white hope of modern blockbuster cinema, but from my
vantage, there is no there there. If you want a lesson in basic
existential philosophy, take a class at your local community college.
You&#x27;ll get more out of it, and you can keep your textbook as a
souvenir. If it&#x27;s great car chases you&#x27;re after, rent &#x22;The French
Connection,&#x22; or &#x22;Ronin.&#x22; In other words, keep your high-octane action
movie out of my high-concept art film. These are two tastes that do not
go great together. Meanwhile, if Inception somehow does &#x22;become a
religion&#x22; in another five years, than I&#x27;m reconsidering my continued
faith in Hollywood as some kind of egalitarian oracle, where the
huddled masses can go to get their myths, and feel the true power of
redemption. If this is the kind of movie that will be worshipped from
now on, than the god of blockbuster cinema may truly be dead.
