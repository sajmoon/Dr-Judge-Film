This movie is a long waste of time. It&#x27;s all about special effects and
confusing plot twists. It&#x27;s idea at the basis is understandable but
they go about carrying it out in way too convoluted a manner and get
carried away with plots within plots. It makes The Matrix seem like
child&#x27;s play. Save your time and money and watch a movie that makes
sense and is enjoyable. I just got my review back and it said I had to
be long, like this movie, and review it with at least 10 lines of text.
How much more can I say about a movie that wasted 2.5 hours of my time
in the theater and now requires I waste more time in reviewing it? I
have never cared much for Leonardo DiCaprio as an actor and his only
redeeming feature was his work for the environment and involvement with
the movie (scarely seen by anyone) entitled, The 11th Hour (2007). That
is a movie I do recommend watching. Other than that, he did &#x27;ok&#x27; in
Shutter Island, a movie which is far superior to Inception.
