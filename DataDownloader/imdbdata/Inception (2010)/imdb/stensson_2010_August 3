I haven&#x27;t got the faintest idea of what this is about. Perhaps
something about controlling other people&#x27;s dreams, to get what you
want. In this case it&#x27;s once again the evil corporation, which wants to
rule the world. OK, great.<br /><br />In fact there is no plot or five running at the same time. You decide.
You can see Paris upside down if you&#x27;re interested, but really, the
time when we got impressed by computer tricks is since long over.<br /><br />Together with all the quasi-intellectualism in the dialog, this is very
hard to stand and not even entertaining. Something is wrong when you&#x27;re
bored already after two minutes and then, there are more than 140
minutes to go. A serious warning about this.
