This is ,unfortunately, a cinematic catastrophe, and all my
expectations that I might have had before like this being the most
original film of the year that might open a new page in the sci-fi
genre, proved completely and utterly misconceived, to say the least.
This is simply the most overrated film after Nolan&#x27;s Dark Knight,
supposedly intended to represent a pinnacle of intellectualism,
originality, and ideas never before even hinted at. But, all in all,
this is nothing but two and a half hours of utter and sheer nonsense, a
real viewing terror, a debasement of a genre! It is in the limitless
realm of quasi-Freudian, or is it Yungian ?, philosophy, e.g., a dream
fixing, and the main actors are faced with a difficult task of
deciphering the way to create the dream within the dream within the
dream, and when you expect to see some true scary Freudian elements or
dream symbolisms of destruction and, God Forbid, sex, no, you are left
in the cold with your feet dangling in the aforementioned &#x27;within
loops&#x27;, as sexuality, as we all know, is the source of all the modern
evils, and as this film is intended for all and sundry, e.g. like a
pleasant, &#x27;wellness &#x27; relaxation after a really exhausting 3-hour
shopping spree, the family must let some steam off in the nearby
cinema, and ,voila, Inception is here with a correctly calibrated dose
of illogical shooting and explosions ( at least I got to see the
technology and weapons the Alpine units today use ), and ,yes, not only
DiCaprio survives , everybody else fares the same, so have no fear,
Nolan is here! But, the damn time, it just won&#x27;t follow the film&#x27;s
logic, 140 minutes is a heck of a time to kill the boiling fury over
this total waste of money, time and personal dignity. Thank God for
Star Wars, Star Trek, Alien series and a million other films. Crisis in
the screenplay department has really surpassed the worst personal
expectations, now even the illiterate are writing &#x85; Just horrible &#x85;
