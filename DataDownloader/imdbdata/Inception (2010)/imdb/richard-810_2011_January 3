We have a phrase in the UK about &#x27;too many eggs spoiling the pudding&#x27;
and my view against the majority of reviewers, is that Nolan had
committed the same sin with Inception. On the positive side, the story
has an intriguing and largely original premise. The cast are all pretty
much excellent &#x96; DiCaprio and Page and but Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy
also and great to see Tom Berenger again. Also a brief cameo by Pete
Postlethwaite who I heard only today has sadly passed away &#x96; a great
actor who appeared in some really interesting movies. Inception clearly
had a big budget &#x96; masses of CGI (maybe a little too much?). All the
ingredients are there but I felt that the script was a layer or two
overdone. The &#x27;arctic&#x27; section for example was largely unnecessary and
didn&#x27;t add anything to the story, other than dubious justification for
extended gun play and James Bond style explosions with people flying
through the air. Make no mistake, the story is very clever and bold but
the plot lacked tightness and tried to be too clever, to the extent
that my attention wandered as did that of those with me (all &#x27;serious&#x27;
movie fans). I really felt that 30 minutes or so could have been shaved
off the running time and that the momentum of the story would have
greatly benefited as a result. I know that Inception has achieved cult
status and that this review will be considered blasphemy by some but I
really feel that this thriller could have been so much better with
tighter editing and direction.
