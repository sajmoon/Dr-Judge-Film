&#x22;Inception&#x22; seems to be taking the premises of such films as &#x22;Peter
Ibbetson,&#x22; &#x22;Altered States,&#x22; &#x22;Being John Malkovich&#x22; and &#x22;The Eternal
Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&#x22; to more elaborate lengths. Throughout
this action flick &#x96; and that is what it truly is, despite its pretenses
&#x96; I couldn&#x27;t help thinking of the most recent James Bond thriller in
which I lost track of who was who among the secondary characters
because the identities they started with were revealed as false, but
then the revelation itself was proved equally false (or at least
dubious), to the point where you couldn&#x27;t believe a word they were
saying and ultimately you ceased to care. <br /><br />With &#x22;Inception&#x22; we get a lot of technical jabbering from the mouths of
Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ellen Page about what
everything means or might mean as they &#x22;share&#x22; and &#x22;engineer&#x22; other
people&#x27;s dreams in order to infiltrate their subconscious to achieve
their corporate goals. These dream states are filled with the usual
action staples of racing and crashing vehicles, explosions and the
liberal use of automatic weapons, accompanied here by huge crumbling
cityscapes (less effective than the more modest melting away of various
smaller environments in &#x22;Eternal Sunshine&#x22;). There is nothing
particularly dreamy about writer-director Christopher Nolan&#x27;s dream
world; aside from a few interesting computer-generated images like a
whole city appearing to fold over upon itself, none of the effects
stick in the mind or affect the viewer&#x27;s juices. <br /><br />Marion Cotillard contributes her trademark broken heartedness. Page
gives the same performance we are familiar with from her telesystems
commercials. Cillian Murphy emotes richly as the kidnapped son of an
energy industry magnate. The heaving score by Hans Zimmer sounds like
hundreds of others.
