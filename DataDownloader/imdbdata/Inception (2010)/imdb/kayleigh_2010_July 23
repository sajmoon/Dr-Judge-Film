To start off, I&#x27;m not usually a big fan of this kind of film. But I
have to say I thought it was very cleverly done, with a very
interesting concept.<br /><br />I&#x27;m not going to give anything away about the plot! I thought that the
casting was fantastic, Leo DiCaprio was brilliant once again (what a
top actor!).<br /><br />You really do have to devote your attention to the film, it&#x27;s
definitely worth seeing twice to pick up on things that you may have
missed; I found it hard to keep up with the dreaming terminology and
which dream states where which and who was the person dreaming, and so
on and so forth.<br /><br />If this is not your kind of film, I&#x27;d still suggest giving it a go.
It&#x27;s got absolutely outstanding reviews, and the film has creeped into
IMDb&#x27;s top 250 films of all time, managing #3 (last time I looked!).
Really worth a watch or two ;)
