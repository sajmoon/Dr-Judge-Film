There are so many things that are right about this film, it&#x27;s hard to
depict which is wrong to give note. As much as I like to focus on the
metaphorical aspect of movies or the brilliant acting performances; the
effects in this movie were jaw dropping. Joseph Gordon Levitt gave a
phenomenal performance (500 Days was good, but this could be the best
of his career.) And to highlight the direction of this movie,
Christopher Nolan proved once again that he is capable of nothing but
brilliance behind the camera. <br /><br />As someone who has a large &#x22;man-crush&#x22; on Leo, I still try to be a bit
skeptical about his films that I have yet to see, out of respect. But
once again, Leo leaped and bounded his way to another stellar
performance, his character once again made me feel like (as he always
does) that it was fit, almost exacted for his persona, and his skills
alike. I try my best never to spoil, only to hype and influence a visit
worthy of the movies reviewed, which this movie certainly falls into
the category of. Films can always be reinterpreted or seen differently
out of theatres, and this is one that deserves your ticket price, an
absolute must-see in theatres.<br /><br />The combination of Nolan, DiCaprio, Levitt, and even Ellen Page who
broke through with an outstanding performance, this movie captivates
that which we all wish to understand-dreams. Whether it is a dream you
can&#x27;t forget or a dream you can remember, this film will explore the
depths of human capability, and more importantly, human emotion. If you
can have the ability to dream, then you can have the ability to
thoroughly enjoy and thoroughly understand the depths of this movie,
which are nothing but spectacular. I HIGHLY recommend
