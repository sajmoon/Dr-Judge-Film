After seeing Inception, you&#x27;re mind will go bonkers when you go to
sleep, and dreams may never be the same. Two years after he hit the
peak of Batmania with Dark Knight, director Christopher Nolan returns
to originality with Inception, featuring a star-studded cast and shot
on man locations around the globe on a very good budget of $160
million. Very little CGI was used in this movie, with most of the stuff
real explosions and stunts and moving set pieces. The surround sound
mix is awesome, especially in IMAX. The cinematography by Walter
Pfister is extraordinary, and the score is haunting. The plot can be a
bit confusing at times, but I sat through it and enjoyed it. Watch it
again.
