2010_August 6 
First of all.. When i entered in a cinema, i had a feeling that this
the day i&#x27;ll never forget. I bunked the very first day of my college to
see INCEPTION, I had my friend and we were very excited about the
movie. now lets get to the movie review... <br /><br />This is the best work done by christopher nolan and his special effect
team. I mean from acting to direction, from story to screenplay,
everything was perfect. Many times we just praise the director, actors,
writer and forget the technicians who works a lot in each section of a
movie production. So lets not forget the special effect team. <br /><br />I also watched the making of INCEPTION and and I saw that each crew
member was giving 100% during the crucial scenes of movie. My final
verdict is.. watch INCEPTION if you want to see a new story(an
IDEA)..and make your brain twist throughout the movie.... seriously
don&#x27;t miss it..
