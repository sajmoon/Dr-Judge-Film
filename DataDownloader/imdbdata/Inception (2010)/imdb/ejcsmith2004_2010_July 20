The next time Hollywood powers that be want to dumb down a movie, I
hope they take a look at INCEPTION first.<br /><br />At the end of the screening I attended, with a packed theater, on a
Monday night no less, there was not only applause, but shouting of
yahoos! The audience was a cross section from a few kids, to 20
somethings to 60 somethings! This is absolute proof that audiences are
capable of keeping track of a fast paced, complicated story with
subplots. Of course some of the time, you just had to just had to give
yourself over to the experience. <br /><br />Probably Leonardo DiCaprio&#x27;s best work since Titanic and that includes
Shutter Island.<br /><br />Outstanding production values, including cinematography.<br /><br />Great casting and good career move for Ellen Page. She&#x27;s definitely
raised her status another several notches. <br /><br />I just have to say hot d**n Chris Nolan. Hope you&#x27;re working on the
next one already I&#x27;ll be seeing this one again in the theater.
