It has been so long since something has been put on screens having a
vivacious mix of feelings, ideas and philosophy. The movie makes you
think of things that probably have never passed your mind before.
Consciousness falling and awakening, the shells of a deserted mind,
what we wish for and what we know we can create and hold close as real,
intelligence and beauty, selfishness and responsibility, light and
darkness. It&#x27;s a nine from me cause the end leaves room for speculation
and my personal belief is that it shouldn&#x27;t have. Otherwise a diamond.
I had almost lost hope of ever seeing such a movie after years and
years of violence and bad content. Always good to watch a display of
sound conscience and human feelings.
