Christopher Nolan is a very good upcoming director and the more time
goes by,the better he becomes,but Inception is in my opinion very
overrated.First things first,this movie is a very nice sci-fi
movie,with perfect special effects and so on but in no way you can
consider it one of the greatest movies of all time,as many people claim
Inception to be.As a matter of fact i found this movie very confusing.I
mean,i can attribute my excessive confusion during the movie to the
fact that i was very tired when i watched the film,but again what the
heck?The script want it or not is very complicated and easy to be
misunderstood but at least the acting is quite good and as i outlined
above the special visual effects used in the movie are hundred percent
plausible and are provoking your awe.These ingredients might be enough
today for a movie to be considered good but if you think that this
movie is a masterpiece you need to adjust a little bit your thoughts
about movies and cinema in general.
