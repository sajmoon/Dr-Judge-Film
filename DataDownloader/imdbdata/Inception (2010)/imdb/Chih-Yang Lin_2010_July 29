The movie is, without a doubt, in a class of its own. It went right
into the main theme, no prelude, which was great. The whole movie
grasped my mind all the way from the start to the end. A fantastic
movie for sure, one of the best movie I have ever seen in my entire
life and I doubt there will be any movie that will get even close in
the near future. The characters had their own styles and it blended so
well. Together with the music and the scenery, the movie was
spectacular. I was so focused that it felt like 5 minutes just passed
and the movie was over! Great work by Christopher Nolan and hope
Leonardo can win an Oscar for his outstanding performance in this
movie. I worked for three hours for this movie ticket and I am gonna
say it is totally worth it!
