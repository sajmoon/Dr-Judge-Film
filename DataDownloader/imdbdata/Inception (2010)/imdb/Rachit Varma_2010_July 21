Inception Pinch yourself after you&#x27;re done watching Inception, you&#x27;ll
feel like it was all a dream! Christopher Nolan has done it again.
After giving us films like Memento, The Prestige, The Dark Knight;
Inception is yet another masterstroke by the maverick director. This
time he has delved into the world of dreams. A world within a dream. He
goes deeper and deeper into the world of dreams and subconscious. And
he does it brilliantly.<br /><br />Cobb(Leonardo DiCaprio) is a thief who steals ideas. But his ability
has made him a fugitive and that keeps him away from his family.
Saito(Ken Watanabe) is a businessman who hires Cobb to do the
impossible, Inception. He wants Cobb to plant an idea in the mind of a
rival businessman Robert Fischer, Jr.(Cillian Murphy), so that he
dissolves his father&#x27;s business. And in return Saito guarantees Cobb
that he&#x27;ll get his life back. And all Cobb wants right now is to get
back to his kids! So will he be able to do the impossible? Inception?
If you think Inception is as simple as what is written above, you&#x27;re
badly mistaken. Its much more than that, its much more than just a
story about a man wanting to get back to his normal life. Its not just
a film that you will watch, its an experience. It makes you think. It
makes you question what&#x27;s real and what&#x27;s not. You wont come out
watching this all happy and satisfied, you&#x27;ll want more. You&#x27;ll want
more clarity, you&#x27;ll want to discuss this over and over again. You&#x27;ll
wonder &#x27;What if?&#x27;.<br /><br />After a long time a movie has come out which is completely original. We
see movies these days, based on a book, out of a franchise, sequels,
etc. etc. But this one is totally original and refreshing.And this, in
my honest opinion, is its biggest strength. After &#x27;The Matrix&#x27;, this is
probably the one which will force you to question yourself about this
world. Its a benchmark on its own. It hasn&#x27;t created a whole new world,
but what it does is, it gives you an &#x27;idea&#x27; that you can create your
own world. A world in your dreams. And who knows, maybe its possible.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio has come a long way since Titanic. Someone once told
me that he&#x27;d read a Leonardo DiCaprio interview somewhere and he&#x27;d said
&#x22;Titanic was the biggest mistake of my life&#x22;. In all probability this
is a false statement, but that&#x27;s not the point. The fact is that it
took him a lot of movies and a lot of courage and brains to get out of
that chocolate boy image he had created unknowingly. I&#x27;m sure you
remember how the whole world went crazy about that blue eyed blonde
cute boy from Titanic. But after movies like &#x27;Catch Me If You Can&#x27;,
&#x27;The Aviator&#x27;, &#x27;The Departed&#x27;, &#x27;Shutter Island&#x27; and now &#x27;Inception&#x27;,
you can definitely say that he&#x27;s grown immensely as an actor and
probably none compare to him today. You give him whatever role and
he&#x27;ll carry it off with panache! And he&#x27;s done a brilliant job in this
film as well. Ellen Page as Ariadne has done a pretty decent job I must
admit. She plays a young prodigy of sorts, and she does it highly
convincingly. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Arthur plays a calm and collected
character, which is kind of a polar opposite of Cobb, which in turn
provides a nice contrast between them. Although Michael Caine has a
tiny role in the film, we clearly see his impact on the film as whole.
Kudos to the rest of the cast as well.<br /><br />Technically this film could&#x27;ve been better I feel. There are certain
scenes which very clearly look shot on a miniature set. I mean,
comparing the best &#x27;effects&#x27; these days, of &#x27;Avatar&#x27;, this kinds of
fades in comparison. But it makes up with a great storyline, intense
action sequences and some great storytelling. But mind you, some of the
special effects will just leave you gaping at the screen in pure
amazement, not because of their technical brilliance, that is there,
but because of the pure imagination put into what&#x27;s shown to us. When
you watch it, you&#x27;ll know what I am talking about.<br /><br />There is not a single moment in the film when you can take a break, go
to the loo, even chewing on your pop corn will disturb you. Even with
proper concentration, you are bound to come out a little confused and
with a few questions in your mind at the very least. You&#x27;ll understand
the basic story and the concept but to know the details and the
preciseness of the story, this film needs another viewing. And that is
the genius of Christopher Nolan. He creates such mind boggling stuff
that it leaves the audience wanting more and more and more. This film
is bound to create a madness online with people giving out different
concepts and theories on what exactly happened in the film. And that&#x27;s
the least it deserves.<br /><br />If I had to describe this film in one word it would be &#x27;crazy&#x27;. Not
crazy in a disturbing sense but the fact that even thinking of
something as complicated as this can confuse a normal human, that guy
creates a whole story around that concept. Hats off to you Mr. Nolan.
You have outdone yourself, yet again. Thanks for making movies! Looking
forward to your next venture! Great stuff!
