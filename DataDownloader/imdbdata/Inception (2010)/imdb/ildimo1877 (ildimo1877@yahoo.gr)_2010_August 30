Cerebral like a Kubrick infected Egoyan, possessor of a Spielbergian
touch, sharing Cameron&#x27;s technological mania, Nolan is (at least) four
directors in one - but that&#x27;s merely an understatement. Far from being
perfect or entirely original, Inception proves to be the, so far,
magnum opus of a distinct auteur in search of his masterwork. For this
Mr. Nolan most certainly is. A one-man-league director, shot out in his
entirely own universe of filmmaking, a craftsman who knows how to
divide his action and create a (sort of televised) montage of
suspenseful situations (Lord of the Rings calling&#x85;), a man who
addresses action operatically and melodrama as an action set-piece.
Thematically speaking this one is a &#x22;pick and choose&#x22; work &#x96; almost
worthy of the &#x22;masterpiece&#x22; term accompanying it. Guilt, the search for
familial redemption, dream as the imprint of an iconic civilization,
the list goes on for 2 &#xBD; hours. And it does so in an emotionally
accomplished manner. Few negative reviews have mentioned a lack of
heart at the core of it &#x96; but this is the Kubrickean aspect Nolan
seeks. If that&#x27;s the game he&#x27;s after, he definitely has to ease on the
wordiness, slow down the pace, look for a different composer and
restrict himself to talking about fewer things vertically than more,
horizontally. In any case, his masterpiece breathes nearby ahead&#x85;
