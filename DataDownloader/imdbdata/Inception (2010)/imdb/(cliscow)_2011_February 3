Wow, what a bad movie. I was truly surprised at how bad it was. It was
an interesting concept but just evolved into a plethora of violence,
noise, and special effects. I am a Leanardo Decaprio fan and have been
impressed with his acting since What&#x27;s Eating Gilbert Grape? (1993) but
there was very little acting in this movie, note: no Oscar nominations
for acting in any category. I can&#x27;t understand how it was nominated for
Best Picture, other than the fact the needed to fill up the new number
of 10 nominees needed. Note, no nomination for Best Director. I thought
Ellen Page was hugely miscast; she was a distraction through-out the
movie. There were only 2 or 3 brief scenes when there was a bit of
meaningful dialogue. There was the potential to develop Cobb&#x27;s
relationship with Saito, but it never happened. If you are expecting a
movie with good acting, good direction, and any depth, do not go to see
Inception. You will be disappointed.
