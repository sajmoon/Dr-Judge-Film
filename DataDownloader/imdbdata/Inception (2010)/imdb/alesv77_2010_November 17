Can&#x27;t believe Inception can be one of the best 10 movies ever.<br /><br />Still, it is.<br /><br />Leaving aside few little flaws, like obvious, redundant lines,<br /><br />Inception is just pure maieutics.<br /><br />You can watch this movie oh, so many times, discovering things about
yourself you&#x27;re oh, so afraid to discover.<br /><br />Some scenes will resiliently stick into your mind, so much you&#x27;ll
appreciate or damn the whole show taking place inside you.<br /><br />Like The Matrix in the nineties, downwards is the only way forwards.<br /><br />Oh, since this site doesn&#x27;t let me end without providing few more
lines, I&#x27;ll add the you might wanna get in touch with Evangelion and
Escaflowne. <br /><br />They are Anime series (just in the scarce case you don&#x27;t know), that
delightfully and slowly, will show you up the very same.
