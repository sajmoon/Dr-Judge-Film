I didn&#x27;t expect too much from this, given Leonardo DiCaprio&#x27;s presence,
but was surprised how weak and unwatchable it ultimately was. This film
was nothing but special effects -- it was impossible to care about any
of the characters, and there was nothing truly interesting or
thoughtful about it. No twists, no surprises, nothing. I was one of the
few times I really felt like I&#x27;d wasted 2 hours of my life, and got
nothing out of it.<br /><br />Nolan&#x27;s earlier &#x22;Memento&#x22; was far more original, thoughtful, and
fascinating, both throughout, and in the ultimate plot reveals. The
13th Floor is a far better execution of a similar theme, more
straightforward and interesting.<br /><br />Save your money, and don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this vastly
overrated collection of silly, pointless special effects to no apparent
purpose.
