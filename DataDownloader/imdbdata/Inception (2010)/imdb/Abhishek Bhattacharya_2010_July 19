Inception is a viscerally breathtaking, emotionally engaging, thought
provoking, preposterous but at the same time ingenious creation from
the mind of one of the most creative, talented and amazing directors
existing today, Christopher Nolan, who has also directed other great
movies such as &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22;, &#x22;Batman Begins&#x22;, &#x22;The Prestige&#x22; and
&#x22;Memento&#x22;. It is an impenetrable, lucid and psychologically complex
investigation into the various layers of the sub-conscious dream state,
combined with some amazing, fascinating and spectacular action
set-pieces with superb special effects. The multi-layered labyrinthine
plot may be too obscure to comprehend at the first viewing and requires
subsequent multiple viewings with great concentration to fully grasp
and decipher this engaging, bold, complicated and often intentionally
ambiguous plot. The Cast and their performances are superb, spearheaded
once again by Leonardo Di Caprio who is fast transforming into one of
the greatest actors of this generation, aptly supported by Ellen Page,
Joseph Gordon Levitt, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Marion Cottilard, Ken
Watanabe &#x26; Dileep Rao. Also, brilliant cameo performances by Michael
Caine &#x26; Tom Berenger helps to transcend this captivating movie into
greater heights. The superb cinematography by Wally Pfitser and the
sublime music by Hans Zimmer is spot on and blends nicely with the
overall feel and atmosphere of this movie, adding to the spectacle. I
don&#x27;t want to go into the specifics of the plot for its best to watch
this movie with absolutely no idea about it, the way Nolan wanted it to
be. Still the basic outline consists of this: Dom Cobb (Leonardo
DiCaprio) is a master thief with a shady past who specializes in
breaking into people&#x27;s dreams and stealing their ideas, is given an
opportunity by a mysterious businessman Saito (Ken Watanabe) to redeem
everything he&#x27;s ever done, and in the process reunite with the children
he left in the U.S. when he was forced for shady reasons to flee the
country. Saito&#x27;s offer includes completing an impossible mission, for
which Cobb must assemble the best team ever compiled for such a
mission. Saito&#x27;s particular offer involves planting an idea in the head
of the heir (Cillian Murphy) of his greatest rival (Pete
Postelthwaite), a process called &#x22;inception&#x22;. The rest of the movie is
up to the audience to watch, grasp, enjoy and interpret, especially the
conclusion which is one of the most interesting, innovative and
original &#x22;open to interpretation&#x22; ending that is sure to keep many
viewers mesmerized and bewildered for days and weeks after the initial
viewing. Finally, In a nutshell, this without a shadow of a doubt is
the greatest achievement in movie-making in the year 2010 and it firmly
deserves all the accolades, plaudits and honours it will receive in the
future. Definitely a must watch for movie buffs, this future &#x22;Oscar
contender&#x22; will most certainly provide all the audiences with a
&#x22;Riveting, once in a lifetime, roller coaster ride&#x22; experience that
must not be missed for anything else in the world.
