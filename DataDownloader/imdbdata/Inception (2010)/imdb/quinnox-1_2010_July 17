Somehow I knew when I checked IMDb this movie would get a ridiculous
rating, and sure enough... This movie is silly, tedious and way too
convoluted for its own good. Not entertaining and mainly an exercise
for the director to say &#x22;Look how clever I am! I can throw in twists
upon twists!&#x22; The actors were uniformly dull, and no one stood out. The
story line was well, just forget it, its not worth going into.<br /><br />&#x22;Memento&#x22; by the same director is far superior to this mess. This movie
isn&#x27;t even in the same league as that. Also, the movie was too long, I
was praying for it to end several times but it just kept going. It was
a relief when the movie finally ended. I can&#x27;t stand movies that wear
out their welcome, and this movie should have been cut to 90 minutes.<br /><br />I&#x27;ll give it a 5 just because it was an intelligent movie, but that is
about all it had going for it.
