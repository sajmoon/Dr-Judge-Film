An intense action/adventure movie about the nature of consciousness?<br /><br />What is reality? How do we know we are dreaming? What is the power of
an idea over our lives?<br /><br />This movie is both highly emotionally and intellectually gripping. It
seems to take hold on a visceral level very rarely experienced in a
movie. The tension brought about by the action and soundtrack... Is
there something subliminal going on here?<br /><br />It&#x27;s more about our wet brain &#x22;software&#x22; than about hardware... A
journey of the mind, between dreams and reality ... Forget the
biotechnology (enabling as it may be) it&#x27;s far more about our brain
ware, the nature of mind, existence, and the trajectories of ideas. The
dream worlds that interact with our real world actualizations, as the
present interacts with our future.<br /><br />There are so many (more than 4, less than 7) plot levels, and
dreams-within-dreams, it produces a challenging enjoyment for the mind
to comprehend it all. Bah to the detractors who just don&#x27;t see it as
masterpiece. Confusion is simply the inadequacy to comprehend many
simultaneous levels. <br /><br />This is the next level of motion picture evolution. Congrats to Chris
Nolan for setting new levels (multiple, simultaneous) that becomes the
new standard -- post Matrix and post Memento -- again.<br /><br />This movie experience may stand in time as a milestone accomplishment,
in Film-experience, and in ontology, I believe.<br /><br />A highly enjoyable action movie experience, perfectly assembled in a
multi-faceted gem of a film. (10/10)
