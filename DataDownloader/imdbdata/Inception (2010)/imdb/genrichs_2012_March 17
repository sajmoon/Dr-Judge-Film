I&#x27;m quite amazed to notice some (quite many, indeed) reviews that
define this film as possible crap. So many reviews that, opposite to
those that acclaim the movie with a 9 or 10 stars, do exclaim on how
bad the movie is.<br /><br />But after reading many of them I say that they mostly base on the fact
of &#x22;unreality&#x22; or &#x22;impossibility&#x22;, or &#x22;unaccuracy&#x22; according to how
oniric universes should be. However these vexing critics may be, they
all huddle into the kind of audience that trend to hate unrealistic
approaches of day-to-day facts.<br /><br />I&#x27;m a Freud admirer, despite I recognize many of his theories are
nowadays obsolete. I have been reading about surrealism for a long
time, and so far there are very little films that were to my humble
opinion able to scratch the skin of such. Normally, science fiction
films stay very far away from the term of surrealism to display a more
approachable and tangible way that becomes very commercial. As a
Spaniard I see directors such as Bu&#xF1;uel as actual genii of this genre,
as I do in other art areas such as Dali and Pedro Salinas, quite a name
in the metaphysical approach of feelings.<br /><br />So does this film diverge so deeply from the metaphysical surrealism
that diserts a deep critic from the most calculating and demanding
minds of this field?. Probably it does. But I believe the intent of
this film falls far from that perspective, and does not intend to be a
precise picture of surrealism itself, but to be a &#x22;what if&#x22; based on
the rules it poses itself.<br /><br />Under those rules, the movie is superbly done. Most acting, scenery,
music and rhythm all converge in a beautifully tempered alternate
reality of action and &#x22;whatifs&#x22;. Whoever wants to critic negatively
this film for not &#x22;believing&#x22; the actual drawn scenery is simply either
a skeptic or a narrow-minded not-wannabe. This is a science fiction
movie, and has its right to make and reconstruct its own rules of
reality, whenever it makes it believable. And the film does this
extraordinarily.<br /><br />Not only I&#x27;m to consider this one of the best sci-fi movies ever made
(along with films like Gattaca, 2001, Blade Runner and so) but also I
do consider it evolved according to the demanding complexity of the
audience. Even though it might fall into improbable or for some people,
unbelievable facts, the way it is carefully woven make you deepen into
the story. Both storyline, and soundtrack go along in a very natural
way, driving the audience into a nevertheless oniric state of reality,
although such reality is just a carefully constructed sensation. But so
beautifully that those who may not deepen into the storyline are those
same people who seek films of ripped reality, perfect scripts that do
not accept other rules than those of the real actual world, and do not
leave room for anything else but their own beliefs.<br /><br />Superb movie.
