Christopher Nolan is a man who can&#x27;t disappoint. Look at &#x22;Memento&#x22; and
&#x22;Insomnia&#x22;, his first films where the budget wasn&#x27;t very high and he
focused on character study instead of action. Now &#x22;Inception&#x22; is what
Nolan can do on a big budget.<br /><br />DiCaprio (one of Hollywood&#x27;s finest talent, I believe) is Dom Cobb, a
man skilled in the &#x22;art of extraction&#x22;, you could say. He goes in to a
man&#x27;s mind to find ideas and steal them. Cobb and his men (including
Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy, and Ellen Page) are soon contracted by
a powerful businessman named Saito (Ken Watanabe) to infiltrate the
mind of business rival Robert Fisher (Cillian Murphy) and make Fisher
lose the power in the company, by making Fisher hate his dying father
(Pete Postelthwaite).<br /><br />After a mostly dull year at the movies, we get &#x22;Inception&#x22;, which
promised to be (and was) the most fantastic film of the year. Nolan
triumphantly returns after &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22;, and brings with him the
cream of the crop of acting talent.<br /><br />How Leonardo DiCaprio has not gotten an Oscar yet is a complete mystery
to me, but perhaps this is his year. His performance as Dom Cobb was
the best so far this year, maybe he&#x27;ll grace the Kodak stage this year?
JG Levitt is a great younger actor and shows us that he&#x27;ll be one of
Hollywood&#x27;s finer younger actors, and we already know that the same is
true of the beautiful Ellen Page, who steals each scene she&#x27;s in as the
newest member of the group.<br /><br />Marion Cotillard, what can I say. This woman is a wonderful actress and
a stunning beauty whose only fault is that she cannot disappoint.
&#x22;Inception&#x22; is made all the better because of her. Tom Hardy is another
great younger actor and is a joy to watch as the free-wheeling &#x22;Eames&#x22;.
Cillian Murphy is always great, he&#x27;s just as good here as he was in &#x22;28
Days Later&#x22;. Michael Caine and Tom Berenger are classic Hollywood
actors and it&#x27;s great to see them around.<br /><br />See it. The year&#x27;s best film, and I&#x27;ve got my money on &#x22;Inception&#x22;
bringing home the Oscars this year.
