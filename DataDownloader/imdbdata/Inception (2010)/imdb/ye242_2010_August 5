I can&#x27;t believe the favourable reviews this movie gets...the movie has
no sense of coherence, terrible plot, very dubious arguments, and only
slightly salvageable performances by the main actors... i am a huge fan
of SciFci/thriller/philosophical movies but this one is so mediocre
that the comparisons to the Matrix series is simply insulting to anyone
with single digit IQs who watched them. Seriously, the movie is
horrible.. Being a huge movie fan I can stand all genres of movies and
all qualities, good and bad...And out of the 1000+ movies (i watch 50+
movies a year since i&#x27;ve been a teenager) I&#x27;ve watched in my lifetime
this movie was going to become only the 3rd movie to cause me to walk
out of the theatre... The only two movies i ever walked out of were
(yes, i remember b/c they were THAT bad): The Lawnmower Man and The
Avengers (with Ralph Fiennes)...So yes, Inception is almost AVENGERS
bad...you get the idea... I didn&#x27;t walk out just b/c i was killing time
for a later date.
