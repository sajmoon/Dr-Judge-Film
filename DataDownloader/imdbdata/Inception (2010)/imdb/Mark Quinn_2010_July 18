Christopher Nolan is one director who has never failed to deliver &#x26; his
latest film, Inception is no different. With this he has created a
monumental &#x26; thoroughly original piece of cinema that not only
entertains but makes you think, something that modern blockbusters have
failed to do time &#x26; time again (e.g. Avatar, Transformers, Clash Of The
Titans).<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio leads a sublime ensemble cast that includes some of
today&#x27;s biggest &#x26; brightest stars and a true legend in Michael Caine,
while Leo himself delivers arguably his greatest performance yet.<br /><br />The film looks &#x26; feels stunning!! The visuals are top-notch, the film
sounds suitably tense while Hanz Zimmer&#x27;s score only adds to the
atmosphere. The script is (as you would expect) brilliant, remaining
complex but relatively easy to follow &#x26; Nolan has once again stayed
clear of conventional narrative to heighten the film&#x27;s complexities.<br /><br />This is a true original &#x26; just goes to show everyone that blockbusters
can be intellectually challenging whilst remaining hugely enjoyable. As
a result, one can&#x27;t help but want more from a standout film in a year
that surely has more to offer than it has produced thus far. A new
dimension of boundary-breaking has just been created by the new Kubrick
/ Hitchcock of film.
