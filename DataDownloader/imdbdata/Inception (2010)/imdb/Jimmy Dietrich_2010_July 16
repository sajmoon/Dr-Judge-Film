If Inception does not win picture of the year then, well, I cannot
imagine what will. This is the only truly flawless movie I have ever
seen. Everything from the plot down to the smallest detail of the
&#x22;Limbo&#x22; was perfect. Christopher Nolan, the eight years it took to
write this script really paid off. Kudos to Ellen Page and
Gordon-Levitt as well, who pull off a brilliant performance and really
capture the role of criminal geniuses. As for DiCaprio, its no surprise
that he delivers one of the best performances one can give. To sum it
up, Inception trumps recent greats such as Avatar, Crazy Heart, the
Hurt Locker, etc. If you have yet to see it, don&#x27;t ask other people to
explain it to you, just go spend the money and take in its greatness.
