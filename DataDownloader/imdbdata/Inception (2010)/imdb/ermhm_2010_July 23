Why are people going mental over this Matrix/Paprika wannabe? It&#x27;s
undeservingly credited for way to many things. Maybe I&#x27;m being too
harsh since it&#x27;s the best blockbuster in the last two years, but lets
be honest. The first half of the movie is drowning in clich&#xE9;s and the
rule &#x27;show, don&#x27;t tell&#x27; is not being utilized at all. Am I the only one
who finds those tedious dialogues when they explain the whole plot (as
if we were ten year olds) - really annoying? The real people in those
situations would talk and react completely differently. That makes the
character interactions and conversations barely believable and just
empty.<br /><br />Also, actors who play Saito and Mal are really destroying any
credibility of the drama and tension movie has. Saito (besides being a
Morpheus wannabe) always talks as if he was simply happy he remembered
the lines. And why, oh why do they have such unnatural, bad and forced
accents? Ellen Page was a bad choice too (another clich&#xE9; - younger
student learns everything sensei has to say in 2 min and then teaches
HIM a lesson). DiCaprio wasted his talent here, his powerful acting was
ruined by the forced tension of the movie and a lousy soundtrack (which
apparently never stops).<br /><br />The second half of the movie was better and combined with the end gave
a certain satisfaction in terms of mental food. Nolan really is a
master of plot and king of moments - unfortunately this is obviously
becoming his biggest weakness. The overall impression is: it could have
been a LOT better. It&#x27;s not awful, but giving it a 10 and calling it a
benchmark is just ridiculous.
