I can&#x27;t believe the hyperbole of some of these &#x22;viewers&#x22;, who probably
never even saw the movie in question. A little disturbing if you&#x27;re put
off by bad acting. I disliked this movie because it was not good,
predictable and inane. While watching I felt like I was in a psychology
experiment to determine how low movie standards could get before people
complained. Ripping this movie apart is like shooting fish in a barrel.
It&#x27;s too easy. So I&#x27;m going to challenge myself to acknowledge the
positive aspects of Inception. First, I&#x27;m impressed with the special
effects. It really did look like Cthulhu&#x27;s head was attached to the
body of a little person. The imbeciles who funded and made this film
are frightening and pitiful their ridicule of those with a birth
defect.<br /><br />I viewed this with my younger sister. She actually laughs out loud at
KING OF THE HILL but this cinematic masterpiece put her into a coma
from which she&#x27;s not yet awakened. This is no different than making fun
of children in wheelchairs or joining the KKK. This film is sickening,
humourless and obscene. I&#x27;ve seen high school plays that were better,
and cheaper. There wasn&#x27;t anything positive about this movie. I don&#x27;t
like my entertainment to be dumbed down.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t have the words to describe accurately the hell that this movie
is. Its debilitating stupidity even fails to amuse. This movie is
definitely aimed at some of the slower turtles in the sandbox. The
story was blatantly stolen from a 10 minute Bugs Bunny cartoon and then
stretched like Mr. Fantastic to 145 excruciatingly painful minutes.<br /><br />Movie...$26.......Popcorn &#x26; Ice cold beverage to avoid falling into a
deep slumber...$4....knowing I will never see another Nolan
production....Priceless (MasterTard...what you felt like afterward)
this movie sucked ! it sucked it sucked it sucked it sucked the Fox
Home Video you suck at DVD-manufacture-- give it up
