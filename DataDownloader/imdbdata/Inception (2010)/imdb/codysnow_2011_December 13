inception is a futuristic movie about retrieving information straight
from the minds people, IN THERE DREAMS!!! this movie is by far no
question the best movie i have ever seen in my life, and by its ratings
hundreds of thousands of people agree with me. Inception is full of
twists and turns and has one of the best group of actors that you could
get in a movie. Leonardo DiCaprio plays an exceptional part as usual,
his character is mysterious, daring, and is by far the best movie he
has ever acted in. if you are wondering about watching this movie or
even if you think you will not like this movie you must 100 percent
watch it, you will be blown away. This movie deserves a 100 out of 10
rating if that was possible.
