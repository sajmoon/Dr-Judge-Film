Of course this film is truly an epic masterpiece. It has the
intelligence and sophisticated elements and design of a modern fiction
action film.<br /><br />You have to pay close attention from the start as it is somewhat
confusing otherwise, but this is one of the reasons as to why it is an
amazing film to watch; it does not bore you. Leo does very well here
and pleases us with his intense acting skills, bringing forth the
emotion and adding to the main aspects of what a successful film
in-tales.<br /><br />What makes Inception different from other modern action films is the
idea of it; a dream within a dream and stepping inside of that dream;
why could no-one have thought of this before? There are some elements
in Inception that audiences can relate to; the elements of being in a
dream state with strange occurrences and thinking that a dream is real
because it appears so true right inside of your mind.
