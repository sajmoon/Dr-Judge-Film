The universe set by this movie is OK. <br /><br />The technology used isn&#x27;t explained... lame. The story is plain and not
interesting. The movie drags on way to long in boring not so much
important it could have been faster convo&#x27;s. The movie length is just
that long because of the long slow conversations and slow motions.<br /><br />But what gets annoying is they don&#x27;t apply the logic they set in the
rules. <br /><br />1. Tip over you come back out (car flipping over is tipping over). 2.
Weightless only works on one dream but doesn&#x27;t apply magically to
another. (Winter Wonder Land has its own gravity i guess)<br /><br />Overall this movie is a waste of time and certainly not re-watchable.<br /><br />Rating of 2 because the non-standard Hollywood movie with new ideas was
kinda nice.
