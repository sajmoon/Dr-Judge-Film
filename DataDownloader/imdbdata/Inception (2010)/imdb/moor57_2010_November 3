First of all, this is not a review to the movie and its story, it is
more than an guide, &#x27;cause i heard a lot of people saying the didn&#x27;t
understood what&#x27;s happening. And when I first saw the movie, it was a
stunning experience.<br /><br />What I can say, the movie is product of a genius writer. The story
takes you into a fictional world like &#x27;matrix&#x27; with its own rules. You
see people who engage the world of dreams of people and interact with
their dreams. This goes further, as they establish dreams within dreams
to engage a construct, within they can interact to manipulate the owner
of the dreams to make them believe it&#x27;s reality and do things as they
will.<br /><br />There&#x27;re many levels of this interaction in this movie and for
understanding i call them &#x27;reality (lvl. 0)&#x27;, &#x27;the van (lvl. 1)&#x27;, &#x27;the
hotel (lvl. 2)&#x27;, the fortress (lvl. 3)&#x27; and &#x27;the room (lvl. 4)&#x27;, which
may help to tell the different plot lines apart.<br /><br />Each level has its own rules of time as explained in the movie,
therefore every happening in the lower levels has a relative minor
importance in the higher levels. You have to differentiate they
happening in the various plot lines, but also think about the influence
they have in the other ones. And in addition, you will be always in
unclarity, if the real world (lvl. 0) is really real.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this movie as I did.
