2010_July 18 
This movie came out on my birthday July 16, 2010, so I went to see as a
present from my parents. I had high expectations seeing as how Chris
Nolan is one of my favorite Directors and Leonardo DiCaprio is one of
my favorite actors. I was blown away by the acting, directing, plot,
and special effects of this film. This movie easily replaced The
Departed as my favorite film of all time. This movie is just so
perfect. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time in the Theater. I
was thinking about this movie the whole night after I got home from the
theater, so I just decided to write a review about it to tell everyone
to go see it. I am true to my word when I say that this movie is
unbelievable and it is a must see! This film has many Oscars coming its
way!
