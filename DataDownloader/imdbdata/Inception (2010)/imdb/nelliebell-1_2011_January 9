Inception is a lie and like all legitmate hollywoods irregardless of
who is doing what to whom there is only the technology that allows this
hysterical calculator(that is all this film represents) in this motion
picture to perhaps make money.There seems not much more to suggest and
that would be if this film made money,? Well did it ? This is what is a
most unusual point to all this,and that would be if this particular
film did not make money what else is this film doing if in fact it did
not make money? What is required to know better or perhaps to truly
know well what the viewer is looking at when as a viewer,the viewer as
it were watches the motion picture &#x22;Inception&#x22;.There is as well another
consideration and that is if in fact the very participation in the
watching of any motion picture is such an experience as to be a
unwholesome experience. I believe it is that(unwholesome) and even more
so provides for a disguise so to mislead any who might be drawn for
what ever reason to watch such a film or for that matter to watch such
are the films of Hollywood,California.There is no degree of involvement
in the making of this film that is in fact authentic and as
illegitimate that that might sound like it is an illegal search and
seizure which allows a thief to be masqueraded as the man with the
candy.This film is not new nor is this film what it appears as is as
well.The result when viewing such a film is that there is no time that
is real nor is there a place as to any particular event is concerned
and if that isn&#x27;t enough there is no definition as to not if there is a
capacity to dream but how do we provide the ability to interject
another ability that could pass as a dream.This is the handiwork of a
masquerade with any here who believe believe not in this motion picture
as there is no dreaming there is only the ability to transmit the
stimulus with the image that is what masquerades as a &#x22;dream&#x22;.It is as
well imposed upon the body of the human race so to provide a
unmistakable influence.The influence as the film provides such a
witness has a goal of influence pure and simple this film is merely
more of the same as the same has meant since as it were its
inception.It is its invention that is at the source of this worlds
ability to influence anything with merely more of the same being all
that the viewer will ever be looking at.The inventor as well as the
inventors many inventions are all patented and do it is believed remain
so.There were some 700 separate inventions with which this unwholesome
day in this world occurred when one Nicola Tesla discovered how to bind
energy across wide open space many many miles from nowhere including
even deepest darkest space.This is the field of regard it is as well
the ability to network with many disparaging elements so to influence
even say Adolf Hitler(I kid you not).Though 1920 is the year of radio&#x27;s
invention and 1921 the year Berlin radio started to broadcast it was a
good time before this point in time that Tesla&#x27;s inventions and
subsequent patents were in place.The better premise would be to know
through Tesla&#x27;s own words as to what capacity does what he invented
provide and without to much trouble Tesla&#x27;s&#x27;s own misgivings provide
for the very problem of being under the influence of a lie.Though this
lie was not meant to interfere with the human race that is exactly what
has occurred.The money men of Teslas&#x27;s own day are at the root cause as
to the necessity to influence anything outside of an antenna.They
remain as perhaps a cog in the wheel that very nearly saw to its
conclusion not to long ago.This wasn&#x27;t Tesla&#x27;s design this was there
influence on his attempt to bind energy that it was not to be unless of
course they could extract a measure if you will of revenge upon
humanity.This is the masquerade that there is a profit motive in this
foreign power as well as an aggression not to be deterred in its
inability to be regulated properly.This is an imperfect science which
has meted out suffering through this field of regard.(network field)It
is this thief in the night and it is as well the exploiter of human
flesh that this film is providing the viewer with.This is what this
film is up to and it has been such since it inception.
