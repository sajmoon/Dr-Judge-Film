Like most modern films, it has very few if any original ideas. Mostly,
it just has rearrangements of ideas from successful films of the past.
The ones that come to mind are Dreamscape, Vanilla Sky, The Prisoner
(2009 miniseries), The Cell, and Total Recall.<br /><br />If you know anything about dream or sleep research you will have to
actively suspend a ton of disbelief. I think this must have been
written years ago or by someone who didn&#x27;t check any sources.<br /><br />I was disappointed upon recognizing the narrow scope of the film.
However, when I saw where they went with it and how deeply they went
into it, I was pleasantly surprised. I was ultimately pulled into the
movie.
