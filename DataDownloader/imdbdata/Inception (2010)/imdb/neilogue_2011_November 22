It&#x27;s a heist movie with a banal twist, placement rather than
extraction. Forget Sigmund Freud and Lewis Carroll. Dreams are
misconceived as just a version of reality with some CGI tricks and so
we move through conceptual layers rather than anything that might
reasonably be passed off as subconscious states. Any ambiguity about
what is real and what is dream merely has us guessing about whether any
of Nolan&#x27;s crafted layers of so called consciousness actually matter at
all beyond supplying opportunity for clever-clever editing sleight of
hand gimmickry.<br /><br />To See Cobb (Di Caprio) and Mal (Cotillard)poncing about in their
mental construct with a hand wave that its ordinariness is due to their
fondness for modernist architecture (serial reiterations of skyscrapers
worthy of a Hanna-Barbera loop)puts paid to any claim that we are
witnessing the like of surreality we visit in our sleep. Dreams in this
film are nothing but different locations arrived at by means of taking
a pill. We sure don&#x27;t get to see Wonderland.<br /><br />All this leads us to wonder about the entire premise which turns out to
be nothing more than a bunch of corporate malarkey. Absorption into the
plot rather depends on the audience buying into the elaborately
technical internal logic about who has to be where and doing what in
various levels of a subject&#x27;s mind to perform the exercise at hand.
That&#x27;s your mission should you accept it.<br /><br />So if you happen to swallow the director&#x27;s pill at the outset then
Nolan&#x27;s fake world will draw you in -James Bond&#x27;s Impossible Oceans
Infinity. Take the pill that powers your critical judgment and for a
couple of ours you&#x27;ll find yourself staring at some overblown money
drain that invites you to consider the deception that marketing and
production gloss can pull off.
