Nolan has always pleased me wit his creativity, and has yet to
disappoint me. This movie doesn&#x27;t have 30 seconds of reel time that
will make you feel any sign of boredom.. Inception is filled with
thrills, and action packed intensity (what we all want right?) which
your mind will be blown. Be careful.<br /><br />And of course the acting is perfect, Leonardo never disappoints. Ellen
Page does a good job for her first serious movie. Which I very much
liked her performance in Inception.<br /><br />Overall will be the best movie of this upcoming decade And ending you
will never forget..
