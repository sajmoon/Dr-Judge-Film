During the movie I was possessed by the thought how can anyone come up
with idea like that. I think this was the most complex, smartest movie
whats been released in recent years. I have seen it only once but I
know for getting full picture of it I got to see it again. There are
just questions that hunt me still. Like what is the original thought
really? Can we think of something thats not been rotten in our
subconsciousness for years or even a lifetime? etc. <br /><br />What concerns the acting then Dicaprio was excellent as he is. All the
others were good too but I don&#x27;t know about Ellen Page. She looked like
with a very little experience in acting. It was a bit surprising she
was chosen for the part.<br /><br />Thanks for reading!
