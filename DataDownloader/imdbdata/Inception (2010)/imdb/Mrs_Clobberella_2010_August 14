I went into the cinema to see this film with sky high expectations
given the domestic and international reviews of it. Phrases like
&#x22;modern classic&#x22; and &#x22;landmark film&#x22; made me think that I was in for
something truly special in terms of film history along the lines of
Citizen Kane and The Godfather.<br /><br />Turns out I wasn&#x27;t, well not all the way anyway. I won&#x27;t bother with
the whole plot line, since it&#x27;s very sprawling and complicated, but
suffice it to say that my main disappointment with the film stems from
the fact that the thematics of the story simply are too limited and
ordinary compared to the potential impact of the film&#x27;s gimmick: the
fact that you can enter somebody&#x27;s dream to steal information or plant
ideas.<br /><br />The plot revolves mainly around industrial espionage, a theme which
simply does nothing for me emotionally. Who cares if one industrial
tycoon wants to stop another? The dream concept of the film is truly
magical and innovative and is a very compelling feature of the film
itself. But why in heaven&#x27;s name marry it to something as pointless as
industrial espionage? What happened to something like the fight for
world domination? It would have given the film infinitely more punch if
the plot had centered around some political intrigue in stead.
Especially given the unstable nature of the world today with wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan, huge climate issues, and so forth.<br /><br />The subplot involving Leonardo DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard&#x27;s
characters to me comes off very flat, their on screen chemistry not
being very strong. This is a shame, for the premise of the subplot has
great emotional potential.<br /><br />All in all, somewhat of a disappointment, despite the wallop one
inevitably receives from the film&#x27;s take on the concept of entering
someone else&#x27;s dreams.
