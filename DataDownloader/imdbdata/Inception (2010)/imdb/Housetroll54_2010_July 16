The plot was so convoluted that half the audience were scratching their
heads and whispering to each other trying to figure it out. Several
people walked out early but we stuck it out nearly to the hour and a
half mark before we had to leave. Worst movie I&#x27;ve seen in many years
and I go nearly every weekend. The only people who would like this
movie are drama majors who enjoy debating the deep meaning of every
scene over their cappuccinos and scones. There were several lines that
were mumbled and the sound was handled so poorly that you couldn&#x27;t hear
what the character was saying. The constant background music was
overpowering and eventually gave me a headache. If you love movies skip
this one and go see The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice - much more entertaining.
