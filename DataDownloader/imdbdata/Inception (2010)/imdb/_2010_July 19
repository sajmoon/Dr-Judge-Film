I saw the trailer and thought &#x22;looks quite interesting&#x22;. Then the hype
started and I read all the glowing reviews from critics (but what the
hell do they know?). Popped to see the film with high expectations
cause Chris Nolan has always been on the money. Well, I could try to
explain but wouldn&#x27;t do it justice. Even if I tried to give away the
ending, there are another 145+ minutes of brilliance to see. I can&#x27;t
recall a film had me so transfixed for every second....thrilling,
clever, grand, entertaining, intelligent, thought-provoking and utterly
mind-blowing. The cast, score, the set pieces, the pace...enough said!
Whatever you&#x27;ve seen before...Avatar, the Matrix...forget them...this
is the new bar!
