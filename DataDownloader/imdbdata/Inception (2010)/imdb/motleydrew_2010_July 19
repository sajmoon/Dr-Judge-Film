The film was well done, but I saw a leap in logic in a spot or two.
That is forgivable with science fiction, so I&#x27;m not deducting points
for it. It gave me a similar feeling as The Matrix did when I saw it
for the first time. Both tease the characters and audience with not
knowing if they are in the real world or not.<br /><br />The graphics were good, but not as explosive as I was expecting. You
see most of the good stuff in the commercials in terms of showing off
the CGI.<br /><br />My only complaint was that the movie was a little slow. I feel they
could have reached the same conclusions with less unnecessary fluff.<br /><br />All in all; the film was very original and leaves the audience
thinking. The acting was excellent, as was the directing.
