Wow. Just wow. On IMDb&#x27;s top 250 list Inception (2010) is the number 8#
right now! Just like Watchmen year before, this movie is another
definition for over-rated. It seems nowadays that films, which you DO
not want to even watch again are getting those 10 votes a-plenty.<br /><br />The synopsis was interesting: men who dive into others dreams and steal
and plant information. Tim Burton would make this amazing, although
typically Gothic. Sadly we got this Nolan-guy, who doesn&#x27;t really know
how to make an action scene, and isn&#x27;t even an artist. <br /><br />Conclusion: Boring shootouts with unknown video game characters and a
non-witty scenario which is topped with &#x22;a dream within a dream within
a dream&#x22; script. Pure garbage!<br /><br />You do not need brains to watch this, none. Lowest expectations won&#x27;t
be low enough. What you need is loads of coffee and a blanket. And then
you have an urge see Matrix (1999) again, which is like 100 times
better and more intelligent than this numbly numbness.
