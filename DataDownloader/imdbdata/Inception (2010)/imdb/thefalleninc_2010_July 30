It is so great to see that originality in western film making isn&#x27;t
dead. I haven&#x27;t been this enthralled by the first viewing of a film
since Donnie Darko. The plot has complexities yes, but all are well
explained and carefully handled so as no meaning or understanding is
lost. The visual scope is stunning, and the pure concept is just so
clever and so engaging. There are a few aspects that need to be
accepted at face value, such as the ease at which Ellen Page&#x27;s
character applies her skill or sedatives altering a person&#x27;s ability to
transport themselves back into reality, but none of this is detrimental
to the overall narrative and nor will it effect the viewers immersion.
There is tension, emotion and the ongoing question of &#x22;where will it go
next?&#x22; keeping you hooked to the end. This could well be a true modern
day masterpiece.
