The only way to describe this movie in one paragraph is it was like the
first time a person has sex, it&#x27;s hyped for about 2 or three years of
your life till finally it&#x27;s prom and you got the parents station wagon
and you got a hotel in the country all set up for your first big night
of love. Then you go to pick your date up and she&#x27;s gotten braces over
the weekend. OK, not the worst thing in the world. Then you slip and
fall while shaking the dads hand and karate chop his balls and grab her
mothers blouse and rip it off on the way down. Then on the way to the
prom you get a flat and you go and change it and you get oil all over
your tux. Then you go to the prom and you think it&#x27;ll be so cool now
that more people are being added to the mix. But it&#x27;s not, and it sucks
because there&#x27;s now so much sexual tension built at this time the dudes
don&#x27;t wanna dance for fear of boners and the girls don&#x27;t want to for
the same reason... Then you finally leave and get out to the hotel and
you think ah well, this whole night was crap but this will redeem it.
This will make it all better... Then you realize she&#x27;s got braces...
And her hymen&#x27;s still intact... And what ensues is 20 minutes of
nothing but blood, pain, and screams of agony coming from both parties
till eventually you can&#x27;t even look at her anymore and you wont be able
to jerk it for a month now because your scabbed penis needs time to
heal.... Yeah thats what inception was like to me....Stick with
Momento...esk stuff dude
