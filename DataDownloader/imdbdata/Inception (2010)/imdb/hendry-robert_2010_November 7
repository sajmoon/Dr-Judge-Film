If you must watch this caper then I would recommend you watch it as if
you were watching a comedy. At least then its tolerable. As you watch
just imagine the delirious brainwashed mind salivating at the infantile
plot. Titter away at the scenes and dialogue they perceive as
intellectually gigantic (easy to spot). Guffaw at the endless streaming
dialogue intended to inform their low IQ brain what&#x27;s going on
(otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t have a clue, guaranteed) <br /><br />I have no complaints about the acting or the production in general. I
do however have to complain about the annoying score which was terribly
loud. At times it was so loud it was actually painful in the mid range.
