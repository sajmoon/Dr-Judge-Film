WE WERE exhausted halfway through Christopher Nolan&#x27;s groundbreaking
sci-fi thriller, &#x22;Inception&#x22;&#x97;but, we couldn&#x27;t take our eyes off the
screen! The brilliant filmmaker has been among our favorite directors
ever since we saw his 1998 mind-bender, &#x22;Following,&#x22; at a film
festival.<br /><br />With the exception of the existentialist bust, &#x22;The Prestige,&#x22; Nolan
has pretty much delivered on his film-making promise&#x97;from &#x22;Memento&#x22; to
the Oscar-worthy &#x22;The Dark Knight.&#x22; Anchored by the outstanding
performances of Leonardo DiCaprio, Ellen Page and Marion Cotillard, the
megman&#x27;s latest triumph, though occasionally tedious to watch, takes
viewers on disparate planes of reality that eventually converge in a
rousing finale.<br /><br />Nolan&#x27;s espionage thriller doesn&#x27;t just navigate around the globe, it
hopscotches through parallel realities as it traverses the confounding
world of dreams: Dom Cobb (DiCaprio) is a special kind of thief&#x97;he
steals valuable ideas from deep within the subconscious during a
person&#x27;s dream state, when the mind is at its most vulnerable.<br /><br />Redemption Dom&#x27;s dream-extracting ability makes him thrive in the
treacherous world of corporate espionage. Unfortunately, it also cost
him everyone he&#x27;s ever loved, including his departed wife, Mal
(Cotillard). The first time we see him, he&#x27;s on the run from US
authorities. His latest assignment offers Dom a chance at redemption&#x97;by
way of &#x22;inception.&#x22; In the deadliest heist of his career, the grieving
protagonist isn&#x27;t just tasked to steal an idea&#x97;he&#x27;s required to &#x22;plant&#x22;
one in the mind of Robert (Cillian Murphy), who&#x27;s heir to the
multi-billion-dollar business empire of mogul, Maurice Fischer (Pete
Postlethwaite).<br /><br />Helping Dom accomplish his mission is an exceptional team: Reliable
point man, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt); chemist, Yusuf (Dileep Rao);
brilliant forger, Eames (Tom Hardy); dream architect, Ariadne (Page),
and his father-in-law, Miles (Michael Caine), who taught him how to
&#x22;share&#x22; dreams. Everything goes as planned&#x97;until someone from the deep
recesses of his subconscious begins thwarting Dom&#x27;s plans! Though it&#x27;s
30 minutes too long, Nolan masterfully weaves his brilliantly imagined
thriller with intriguing scientific concepts that have been haunting
humans in their waking state: How relevant are dreams in our lives? Are
they merely projections of our subconscious? And, what do we learn from
these disjointed snippets of memories and yearnings that don&#x27;t have
beginnings and endings? Boundaries Nolan adroitly manufactures a
semblance of scientific believability that establishes boundaries for
the movie&#x27;s complicated concept. What keeps it &#x22;relatable&#x22; are the
existential themes&#x97;guilt, redemption, intimacy, the consequences of
sin&#x97;Nolan utilizes to drive the story forward and keep the viewers
guessing until the credits roll.<br /><br />&#x22;Inception&#x22; isn&#x27;t just a mind-bender, it&#x27;s also an edge-of-your-seat
action whose thematic conceit allows the production to defy the laws of
physics and psychology.<br /><br />You&#x27;ll probably need more than a single viewing to understand the whole
thing. Sometimes, it&#x27;ll drive you nuts just trying to figure a way out
of one psychological maze after another! But, Nolan and his actors make
some cogent arguments about the mysteries of the subconscious that are
hard to refute.<br /><br />Nolan&#x27;s exceptional thriller bends rules of fact, fiction and
fantasy&#x97;and you have to watch it to see how it&#x27;s done. But, this film
would have been harder to take without its outstanding actors, who
embrace and fuel the production&#x27;s out-of-this-world concept.<br /><br />DiCaprio and company don&#x27;t just manage to steal moviegoers&#x27; hearts and
minds, they also plant seeds of appreciation for a summer movie that
dares to be more than the usual Hollywood action.
