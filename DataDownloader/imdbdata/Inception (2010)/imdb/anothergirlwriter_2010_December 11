I had high hopes, I really did. I was expecting a complicated plot,
with twists and turns all the way through. I was expecting something
jaw dropping...especially with all the raves it&#x27;s been getting. So to
the point 1- fascinating theme. Dreams, Inception. It&#x27;s creativity
should get itself a ten 2-complication? Not so much. it was mostly
predictable, and it was easy to follow along. Sure, there were twists
and stuff 3- Events that took place were pretty cool. The places the
sub concsious (sp) could do, and people attacking, and good action
scenes 4-acting? It was great, and believable. 5. character
development? Not so much. Almost all characters were glossed over,
except for the mainest main character. except the movie shouldn&#x27;t have
been all about him. it needed to be more than just about his
relationship with his wife. what about arthur, and his team? 6. great
action so overall, i believe that all the low ratings is because they
had high expectations, and all the high ratings because it is something
different than what is usual. i found it super entertaining, and got
swept away in the idea of Inception. So overall-great action movie, and
its something more than what we are used to.
