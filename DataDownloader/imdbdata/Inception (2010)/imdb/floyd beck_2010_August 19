The best movie this year that should be one of the Top Ten of the
century. The special effects are superb and beautiful, which makes
sense as the CGI industry continually improves. The movie is a bit
complex, but not as complex as the movie Memento, made in 2000, another
IMDb 9 out of 10 rated movie. Nonetheless, it will require viewing
twice, or should I say, it will desire viewing twice. I saw it at the
theater and am eager to buy the DVD, hopefully soon. There is constant
action, with just a few slow talk scenes. I rated it 10, even though
the use of Christ&#x27;s name about 6 times was a bit unnecessary. Why can&#x27;t
they use Clinton&#x27;s name, instead, such as &#x22;For Clinton&#x27;s Sake!&#x22;?
Finally, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.
