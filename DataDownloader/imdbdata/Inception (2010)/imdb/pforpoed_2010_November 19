Let&#x27;s get this out of the way right now: This movie does NOT make you
think. I am so sick of that clich&#xE9;. A movie may be challenging to the
senses and demand your undivided attention, but it can&#x27;t make you
think. You think independently of movies, people. Stop giving Hollywood
that much credit.<br /><br />That said, I found Inception to be a grand disappointment. One of the
things that marks other Chris Nolan projects is his love of character
and development of such. Nolan has interesting ideas, but once he gets
the germ of an idea, he then populates his films with rich and
interesting people, giving them compelling stories, making us care
about what happens to them beyond the constructs of the idea. Not just
masterpieces like Memento, The Prestige, and Insomnia (one of the few
English language remakes of a foreign film to get it right), but even
in his &#x22;comic book&#x22; movies, Batman Begins and THe Dark Knight, Nolan&#x27;s
love of character and relationships is what drew us into the story.<br /><br />Insomnia is about 2-dimensional characters (okay, some of them flirt
with being 2.5-dimensional) who wander through a complex and admittedly
brilliant idea for a little over two hours. There are some stunning
visuals and some quirky twists, but for the most part I fought to stay
awake because I did not care. I was told not to leave to go to the
bathroom or I would be lost when I came back; well, I nodded off for 15
minutes and did not miss a beat.<br /><br />And for all this primal hooting about the breathtaking final shot, a
moment that elicited gasps from audiences across America ... not to
sound arrogant, but I must be smarter than most audiences because I saw
that moment coming. I knew how the film would end, and I knew what that
last image would be.<br /><br />An okay film, but not up to Nolan&#x27;s standards.
