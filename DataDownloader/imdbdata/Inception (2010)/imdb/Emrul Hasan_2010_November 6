This is one of the greatest movies I&#x27;ve ever seen. While watching this
movie I got the same feelings when I was watching &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; or &#x22;The
Lord of the Rings&#x22;. After finishing the movie I was satisfied. The
finishing is excellent. This long movie never bored me. Every moment
was interesting and I could not take away my mind for a second.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan is the boss. All of his movies are mind blowing. His
thought are ahead of time and outstanding. And Inception is speechless.
Direction is perfect, special effects and choreography is more than
perfect. It will simply blow your mind away.<br /><br />The theme of this movie is not so simple. Human got the technology to
dream whatever he wants, build his own dream world and also enter
other&#x27;s dream. Dom Cobb is a special man whose job is to steal ideas
from other&#x27;s mind. He is perfect at this. But he also a fugitive for
the death of his wife Mal which is actually another interesting story
of Inception. Cobb got a chance to go home if he can do the final
inception which is not stealing idea but to plant an idea into Robert
Fischer&#x27;s mind.
