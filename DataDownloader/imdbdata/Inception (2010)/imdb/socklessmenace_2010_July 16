Inception is the most well crafted, thought out, mind blowing
masterpiece I&#x27;ve ever experienced. By saying this I am not saying it is
my favourite movie although it has great potential of being so after a
few more viewings; but it is the greatest movie I&#x27;ve ever seen because
of how perfect it is in every aspect of what it is. Christopher Nolan
creates a world and a story within that world that is so perfected in
every way that it makes you sit there and believe in what your
watching, that&#x27;s how emerged you become in this picture. But I would
actually rather classify it as something other then a film for no other
film has made me feel or think this way afterwords. You sit in awe, and
as the screen goes black your overwhelmed by what you&#x27;ve just sat
through.<br /><br />I can&#x27;t stop thinking about it! It&#x27;s completely consumed me and I&#x27;m
totally thrown away by what I have just watched. Christopher Nolan has
created art with this Film. It will force you to watch it again and
again just to understand everything you just went through. I feel like
I haven&#x27;t finished watching it and haven&#x27;t completed my Inception
experience till I watch it at least two more times...it&#x27;s breathtaking,
thought provoking and I feel like I haven&#x27;t left the theatre because
the movie wont get out of my head! There&#x27;s no describing it, it&#x27;s
simply Inception.
