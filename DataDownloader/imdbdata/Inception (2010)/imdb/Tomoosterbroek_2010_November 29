My feelings about this movie is probably best illustrated by the
Southpark episode &#x27;Insheeption&#x27;, just because a film is complex,
doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s good or cool.<br /><br />Making a film more complex and multi-layered doesn&#x27;t necessarily make
it a deeper and more engaging film. In the case of Inception, it
generally only makes it more complex, and not in a way that is to the
film&#x27;s merit.<br /><br />The complixity gets in the way of the film&#x27;s plot a lot, which is quite
frankly, not that complicated.<br /><br />I can only call the film, an overly complex, though decent film, that
just insists too much upon itself. It&#x27;s a decent film,and although
graded equally on IMDb, it does not deserve to be amongst the likes of
The Shawnshank Redemption and The Godfather.
