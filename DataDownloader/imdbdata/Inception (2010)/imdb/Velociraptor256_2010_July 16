These days, it feels like the majority of movies coming out are sequels
or adaptations (which aren&#x27;t necessarily bad, but all too often they&#x27;re
just made to make money and too little effort is put into them), or
otherwise just unoriginal and lazy. But Inception is different.
Inception is something entirely new. And Inception is awesome.<br /><br />Basically, it&#x27;s about a team of people who specialise in entering
people&#x27;s dreams and extracting information from their minds; except now
they&#x27;re being called upon to place an idea in someone&#x27;s mind, which is
much harder...and that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m going to give away if you haven&#x27;t seen
the movie, it&#x27;s too good to spoil. Just about everything here makes for
a top-notch movie-going experience. The film flows perfectly and is
never boring. The story completely sucks you in: it&#x27;s fascinating,
intense and perfectly written and executed (no easy feat considering
the nature of the story, moving from one &#x22;world&#x22; to another, which adds
to the film&#x27;s unique feel). When special visual effects are called for
(e.g. the initial dream construction scenes, and the zero-g fight
scenes), they are just breathtaking. There&#x27;s no weak links in the cast,
with Leonardo DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard giving particularly good
performances.<br /><br />The closest thing to a flaw Inception has is that it is a little
complicated, mainly in the first act&#x27;s explanations of how the dream
construction works. But when you get to the second and third acts, that
doesn&#x27;t really matter: you only need to know the basics to follow
what&#x27;s going on, and that&#x27;s easy enough.<br /><br />Inception is easily the best movie of 2010 so far: director Christopher
Nolan has provided a great example of how movies should be made, and it
would be nice if more people were to follow his example.
