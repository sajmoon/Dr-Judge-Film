I wanted to like Inception because I think most of the people involved
are talented, but it is just an endless exposition of the ever-changing
&#x27;rules&#x27; of the dreamworld. It&#x27;s a shame. It isn&#x27;t confusing, but it is
very boring. There are no engaging characters and it has no trace of
humour. It does have some good performances and... nope, that&#x27;s it.<br /><br />It&#x27;s not a terrible film, it&#x27;s just very very dull. When all rules are
taken away, it would be nice to see some genuine imagination - not a
few FX set-pieces which don&#x27;t, even at a most basic level, do anything
to help the wafer-thin story, You know what this is like? It&#x27;s like
reading a dream diary - a fragmented collection of somebody else&#x27;s
ultimately vapid ideas. It&#x27;s worth watching once to say &#x22;Was that it?&#x22;
and shrug.<br /><br />Watch Mr Nobody instead. It takes Nolan to school.
