Well, the trailers, the reviews had my anticipation going before I
watched the movie. However, the expectations were tower high as Chris
Nolan is one of my favorite directors and Leo is my favorite star. I
prefer never to miss his movies.<br /><br />Merits First : Story , Screenplay and Direction : 10/10 ,Direction was
consistent in all the places, didn&#x27;t feel continuity errors, Story and
Screenplay were so engaging that involved the viewers at every point in
the movie, challenges them and leaves them enthralled, confused ,
wanting for more.<br /><br />CGI / Special Effects : 8/10 , Got patchy in a couple of
places,specially the Paris Cafe Scene.<br /><br />Acting : 10/10 Totally Blown away by the performances of Leo, Ellen
Page , Joseph Gorden Lewitt , Tom Hardy are exceptionally good .<br /><br />Technicals , Cinematography , Casting : 10/10 Nolan just paints the
canvas with beautiful dreams and subconsciousness of people.Background
Score needs a special mention as it adds to the mood of the film.<br /><br />Inception is the story of Dom Cobb(Leo) and his team of &#x22;Extractors&#x22; ,
who deal with a special kind of security called subconscious security.
They enter the dreams of subjects, extract their secrets from the
dreams. Cobb is a fugitive of American government and corporates. He
stays in Japan and want to get back to his family. A Powerful Japanese
client offers him a deal to give his life back in return for his life
and lift all the bans on him in return for planting an idea in his
competitor&#x27;s mind. Cobb decides to take a &#x22;Leap of Faith&#x22; and starts
collecting his team for this. He meets Ariadne, a young and bright
architect from his father&#x27;s university , and Eames who leads him to
Yusuf, a chemist with deep sleep sedatives. Together, they start
working on the mission to plant the dream in Fischer Jrs Idea.<br /><br />No spoiler&#x27;s here I will not reveal anything from suspense but on a
whole the movie deserves a standing ovation as execution of such a
script is a very difficult task, Nolan has handled it quite
efficiently. The anti-gravity scenes were too good. The cinematography
, the creation of dream worlds , the concept of architects were so good
that you can believe that the time required to build the script and its
depth took 10 years and the movie was pitched to the producers just
after memento.
