Brilliant technical wizardry. Heady, at least apparently so. A ride
more than a movie but a movie none the less. Chris Nolan is rapidly
becoming the director of his generation and I&#x27;m longing to find out
what is he trying to say. He has established his technical power again
and again but if I think of &#x22;Memento&#x22; for instance I remember the
gimmick but not what the story was really about. I suspect the same
will be said of &#x22;Inception&#x22;. I&#x27;m not putting down, I&#x27;m just wondering.
I left the theater full of questions and nobody could actually give me
any answers. I&#x27;m not talking about the plot but at the way Christopher
Nolan chose to tell the story. Leonardo Di Caprio is acquiring some
extra gravitas as an adult presence on the screen.Loved Cillian Murphy,
I always do. Riveted by Tom Hardy. Enchanted by Marion Cotillard.
Amused by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and delighted by Ellen Page. I wonder
what Mr Nolan will do for an encore.
