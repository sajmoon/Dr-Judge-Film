OK, Inception is, in my opinion, the culmination of everything that&#x27;s
wrong with the movie biz these days.<br /><br />Awful dialog and no characterization, stock actors who give stock
performances, plot holes that are covered by the a fore mentioned awful
dialog and weak characterization, an inability to explain much of the
way the dream world and limbo work, and the ambiguity of the entire
movie is quite over the top. <br /><br />If something isn&#x27;t done soon, movies like Inception will be considered
great works of film when the people who work on them don&#x27;t even take
the time to have a coherent storyline.
