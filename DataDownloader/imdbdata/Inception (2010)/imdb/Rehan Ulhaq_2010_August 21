This is one of the best movies i have ever come across. I am a true
movie geek and love to compare directors. Chris Nolan is one of my
favourites. After movies like memento,dark knight,prestige Nolan has
taken it even one step further if ever that were possible. The movie is
almost perfect if not it, the story line is so well written that you
cant take your eyes off the movie even for a second. Learnardo was it
his absolute best. The casting is absolutely amazing, every1 involved
in the movie is as if he/she was born for the respective part. Nolan
trademarks are very apparent in the movie. As the movie runs along you
become more and more involved, surprisingly fiction seems real. Even
the effects in the movie are marvellous. All in all i will say this is
a must watch movie. Any one who has not seen this has deprived himself
of a true masterpiece !!
