2011_March 6 
I had this film sitting around on my hard drive for a good 6 months and
never got round to watching it. But after seeing the high score this
film has on IMDb I thought it was about time I took a look at this
&#x27;masterpiece&#x27;. I started watching the film back in January and managed
to handle around 30 minutes before my interest started to wain. After
another few weeks I finally had a second attempt at watching the whole
film and I have to say I think I need a commendation for sitting
through this convoluted mess all the way to the end. How this film has
ended up at No.8 in the all time Top 250 I have absolutely no idea; all
I can think of is nowadays very good special effects constitute this
film as a classic as opposed to acting and storyline??? Perhaps they&#x27;re
are too many sheep on the planet nowadays....this would account for the
ridiculous 8th best film of all time ranking.
