This is one of the most hyped-up films in recent memory and I feel
exactly the same way after I saw The Hurt Locker. Don&#x27;t believe the
hype - make up your own mind. I am a fan of Christopher Noland and
DiCaprio and think Juno with Ellen Page is one of the most original
films I have ever seen with her outstanding performance. But Inception
is, please excuse my language, simply a gargantuan piece of crap.
Illogical plot, weak acting, a plethora of unnecessary, distracting
violence - the film never did it for me. After less than an hour I
wanted to leave the movie theater, were it not for a niece evening with
my wife in the unique and great Moolah theater in St. Louis. Simply
disappointing and I just cannot believe what I read in the other
reviews. Did you see the same movie?? Did you write up what you wanted
to see or what you actually saw? Number #3 on the list of all-time
greatest films?? Give me a break.
