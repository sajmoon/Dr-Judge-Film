This review is being written by a 46 year-old guy. I mention this
because clearly this is a film where age is important, as younger folks
probably will enjoy the movie more--and can take the fast-paced action
and frenetic pace. I assume older audiences probably will be a little
less amazed and a bit overwhelmed with the film. Just something to
consider as you read this.<br /><br />As for the movie, I&#x27;ll be up front about the fact that I did NOT love
this film. It&#x27;s just not the sort of movie I&#x27;d usually see and only
went because my oldest daughter nagged me to go. I am glad I did,
however, as I really could respect the movie in many ways. First, the
story is wildly original (though, also quite confusing). Other than the
Matrix films, I can&#x27;t think of anything that even comes close to it in
style. Second, the production looked and sounded great. The music was
intense and worked great with the amazing, totally amazing, special
effects. Third, it was nice to see so many kid actors show that they
are NOT light-weights and could act. Leonardo DiCaprio is no longer the
pretty young thing he was in &#x22;Titanic&#x22;--his maturity and grit were
welcome. Also, seeing the kid from &#x22;Third Rock&#x22; suddenly playing an
action hero was great--you&#x27;d barely recognize him--or the other grown
child actors. Fourth, I loved the ending--it really pulled everything
together very well.<br /><br />So why am I not giving the film a glowing review? Well, I am simply not
an action film fan. And, the insane pace, TONS of shooting and crazy
plot simply lost me at times. I much preferred the slower and more
introspective moments of the film. Also, while Ken Watanabe is a fine
actor, I had a devil of a time understanding a lot of what he said--to
the point where I wish they&#x27;d either dubbed him or had caption! Now
this is NOT just because I am an old crank who is slightly hard of
hearing--my daughter, too, found his thick accent difficult. On the
other hand, Ms. Cotillard was VERY easy to understand and I was
surprised how well she controlled her lovely French accent.<br /><br />I could probably go on and on about the film--as it&#x27;s long, complex and
VERY prone to be one to watch and re-watch and discuss with friends.
However, at this point, there are already a bazillion reviews and 7
billion people have already gone to see it, so I&#x27;ll call it a day.<br /><br />Well worth seeing....but perhaps too frenetic and confusing for many.
