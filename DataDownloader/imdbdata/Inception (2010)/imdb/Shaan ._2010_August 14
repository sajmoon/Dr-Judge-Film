Inception has a multi-layered plot, quite literally in fact. It focuses
on the emotional journey of its lead character, Cobb, but at the same
time thrusts the audience into multiple levels of action packed story-
telling, very distinct from one another, but all finely connected. It
has been described by critics as &#x22;a film that rewards intellect&#x22;, and I
can assure you that it is exactly that. Director Christopher Nolan
challenges the audience to keep up, and rewards those who can with a
breathtaking spectacle, one that has the capability to leave you
awestruck. The best part about it is that while you may feel you need
to watch it again to be able to fully absorb the experience, chances
are, you will probably want to.<br /><br />The final hour of the film, is possibly one of the most complicated
action sequences put on film. You have to constantly be paying
attention to remember all of the layers of what is happening. Without
spoiling anything, all I have to say is that is what this film is
about, that is what makes this film so great, layers. Once you have
seen this you will now what I am talking about.<br /><br />Great Great Great
