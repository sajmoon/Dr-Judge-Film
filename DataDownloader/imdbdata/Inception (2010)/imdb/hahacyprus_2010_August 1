I walked into the movie theater where they were screening Inception,
not knowing a thing! The only trailer I had seen then was the teaser
(where they don&#x27;t give out any details on the plot or etc.) . All I
knew was that , visually, it looks mesmerizing. The reason why I didn&#x27;t
watch any of the trailers or read the synopsis is because lately I&#x27;ve
been going into movies without knowing a thing, hence as it unfolds , I
would enjoy it even more. As I watched Inception unfold in front of me,
I forgot everything around me, and slowly began to realize what a
genius Nolan truly is.<br /><br />The beauty about Inception is how the story slowly reveals itself.
Nolan never gives everything away instantly. So, I&#x27;m gonna be quick and
brief in order not to ruin your experience: In the future world (where
there are no big pointless gadgets, but slick and cool architecture),
we have a technology that allows us access into one&#x27;s dreams. It is
usually used in order to extract ideas from ones brains. Cobb
(Dicaprio) is a man who gets one last chance to return home when he is
asked to implant an idea (into who&#x27;s mind and etc , I&#x27;ll leave that to
you to find out.) by assembling a team and dive into that person&#x27;s
dreams.<br /><br />However, the story is much more complicated than that. This film has
big brains; and you need to focus thoroughly in order to keep up with
what&#x27;s going on. However, My God what a movie! When I first got what
the film really is about (since , I repeat, I didn&#x27;t know a thing) I
almost jumped out of my seat and began cheering...almost. It keeps on
unfolding and Inception is like an onion; there are layers after
layers. It keeps you wondering and leaves the answers to you.<br /><br />Dicaprio gives one hell of a performance!! This is probably his best!
He is having one hell of a year, and by God if he doesn&#x27;t get an Oscar
nom...His expressions are priceless! His eyes express everything so
easily!Cotillard is creepy as hell (not going to ruin it, unless you
already know) and also worthy of a nom. Ellen Page and the rest of the
cast excel! Joseph Gorden Levitt gets to be part of the craziest action
scene ever! (The one with the spinning hallway...oh, and as he flew
through the corridors and etc.) <br /><br />Nolan is a genius. It is said that this took him 10 years to write! We
are surrounded with remakes, sequels, book and TV-shows adaptations,
and the films based on nothing are 3D crap. However, without the help
of 3d, he created an amazing story and a visually immersing experience!
The folding of Paris, the paradox staircases (only to name a few) are
proof of his creativity. In addition, this is one hell of psychological
thriller. It&#x27;s in depth study of Cobb&#x27;s mind...and ours!He keeps you on
the edge of your seat, waiting to know what&#x27;s gonna happen
next...Brilliant! <br /><br />The visuals are stunning, and so is Zimmer&#x27;s score. Wally Pfister&#x27;s
work here is outstanding! He better get a nom, at least. The Art
Dirction is what caught me the most as a matter of fact! The sleek cool
style is tempting! <br /><br />I made a list of the best films of the last decade, and I believe this
beats all of them! Intelligent, thrilling...I might even go ahead and
say that this is one of the greatest thrillers ever made! (And not
getting it isn&#x27;t an acceptable reason for not liking it.) Bring on the
Oscars!! Now, there&#x27;s a debate as to how the film ends, and , point is,
we&#x27;ll never really know. I&#x27;m gonna stick to the ending that makes this
film even more intriguing...Definitely worth multiple viewings! This
film, not only does it dwell into Cobb&#x27;s mind, it&#x27;s one of those rare
psychological thrillers where Nolan toys with you! The entire time Cobb
(and you) is lost as to what is real and what is a dream. In the end,
you realize that it&#x27;s you who is stuck in that conundrum...
