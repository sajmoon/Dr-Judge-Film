Inception is a marvelously carved masterpiece , by Christopher Nolan.<br /><br />Well I&#x27;m not going to write much about the scenes, But yeah, about the
movie.<br /><br />Nolan has always been an excellent narrator, and his movies are well-
known for the direction and screenplay. His previous films , like The
prestige, Memento , had excellent( perfect) screen-play. This time, it
only gets better and better.<br /><br />He uses CG , and Visual Effects very well , and they are apt. Many
directors simply make the producers to throw away the money on CG ,
where there are not really required.This doesn&#x27;t hold good for
Christopher Nolan.<br /><br />When it comes to acting , De Caprio is another fantastic actor. There
is some &#x22;Shutter Island&#x22; nostalgia seen in him in some occasions. All
the other actors including Michael Caine , and Cillian Murphy (Often
seen in Nolan Films) give an outstanding performance.<br /><br />This movie is a must watch for fantasy freaks and every one :) I rate
this (9.3)
