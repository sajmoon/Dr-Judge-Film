I think I finally came around this movie after months. My first review
was sloppy and superficial. I&#x27;ve seen it months ago and since then I
haven&#x27;t give it much of a thought. But now it hit me from nowhere, I
finally see what the essence of this piece of art is- it&#x27;s about the
art of manipulation.<br /><br />There are only a handful of movies, every now and then a new one is
made, for which it can be truly said that it represents some kind of a
&#x22;document&#x22; or at least an amazing meditation of how we already live
today and how we will live in the near future. In this regard I would
put Inception right next to the Matrix. The later is in essence a film
about a completely ignorant super-used workforce of humans, who haven&#x27;t
actually moved from their wombs yet, but at the same time they have
computer generated illusions about how they reached &#x22;the peak of
civilization&#x22;. This kind of humanity is completely immature (but not
pure, or innocent) until a New man comes from somewhere and decides to
move from this cave of ignorance and unconscious slavery. Most of them
stay there, some by their own free will, because it&#x27;s pleasant.<br /><br />Now the key thing about this movie, is not just that it&#x27;s a long
&#x22;journey into the mind&#x22;, but what matters is what comes out. It takes
inception to make perception. That&#x27;s the whole trick. The conciseness
is a product and the subject of manipulation doesn&#x27;t know a bit about
it. He wrongfully thinks that his consciousness &#x22;mirrors&#x22; the world &#x22;as
it is&#x22;, but it doesn&#x27;t, it never did and it never will.<br /><br />Inception is a pure and plastic example of how we live in the 21.
century. We live in a world where there is an infinite amount of media
inception of ideas on a daily level. All of it is very well planned and
targeted, nothing spontaneous about it. And yet we still egoistically
think how our minds &#x22;mirror&#x22; the world as it is and how independent we
are. We cannot except or even know that our minds are a product, that
our perceptions are a product. To realize that, one would at least need
to &#x22;plug off&#x22; for a substantial amount of time from this. But that is
costly, so nobody does it. In the end our own defense mechanism screw
us up, because we refuse to recognize what kind of fools we are.
