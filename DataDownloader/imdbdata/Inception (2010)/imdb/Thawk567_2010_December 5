This was without a doubt a perfect film. Christopher Nolan is on a
roll, first The Dark Knight and now Inception. This is another movie
where you can&#x27;t talk, text or go to the bathroom during the progression
of the film. This movie was simply mind-blowing, I knew that this was
going to be a excellent film by just looking at the poster. This was
also an all-star cast, with some heavy hitters like Leonardo Dicaprio
and Michael Caine, and some great up-coming actors like Ellen Page and
Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Joseph caught me by a major surprise, his acting
was superb. Also I was surprised that the movie would end out in a
&#x22;Cliff Hanger&#x22;, I&#x27;m not going to say what happens in the film because I
don&#x27;t want to ruin for you guys because the movie is to good to just
read the spoilers. Anyways 10 out of 10 stars.
