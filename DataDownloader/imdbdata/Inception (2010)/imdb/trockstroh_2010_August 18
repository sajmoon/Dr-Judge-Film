Let me start by saying that this movie would have been good had I not
seen Shutter Island or read &#x22;I am the Cheese&#x22;. Inception is nothing
more then Shutter Island meets the Matrix. The motive and the plot are
the same in both Shutter Island and Inception. SPOILER DO NOT READ IF
YOU WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIE.<br /><br />Both of DiCaprio&#x27;s characters in these films both blame them selves for
the death of their wives, they spend the movie creating a world where
they do not have to live with the guilt of their loss. I know you are
reading this and thinking &#x22;But a lot of movies have wives as the root
of the characters problems&#x22; and your right so let me go further. In
both movies DiCaprio also has issues with his children, in one they are
dead and in the other he is unable to see them.<br /><br />Now if that isn&#x27;t enough here is the mini cherry on top of the regular
cherry on top of the Sunday of recycled garbage that is this film. In
both movies he blames a single selfish action of his own doing for the
reason of his wife&#x27;s death. This is why he creates these worlds to live
in to hide the truth from him self.<br /><br />On a positive note the effects of this movie were awesome. Some of the
best I have seen in a long time I enjoy seeing Hollywood try something
new rather then overload their films with CGI. Other than that I have
nothing positive to say about this film.<br /><br />I end this by saying watch either Shutter Island or Inception, either
film on their own was OK but when you watch one after the other all you
can do is think &#x22;Man why is Leo playing the same roll again, he has
depth he is much better then this&#x22;. Also Nolan go out and find a good
script and stop piggy backing off of other films.
