If you&#x27;re a fan of sci-fi and virtual world movies, this is the movie
for you. I thought Avatar was great but Inception beats Avatar on sheer
mind warping intensity. Nolan has outdone himself&#x97;how, I&#x27;m not sure.
The cast, and production simply glow. Everywhere you look there is
action and intrigue. There are lines of great, great dialogue and some
stellar performances, and some of the most astonishing production
values I&#x27;ve seen in years. Go and see it. Make this world yours. You
won&#x27;t regret it. Then ask yourself if you can tell the difference
between what&#x27;s real and what&#x27;s the dream. The plot is complex and it
keeps you on your toes. As a movie it&#x27;s worth seeing several times just
to get your head around the complexity&#x97;particularly the part where ...
well, that would be telling. Clever, clever stuff and all in all, a
great movie. See it.
