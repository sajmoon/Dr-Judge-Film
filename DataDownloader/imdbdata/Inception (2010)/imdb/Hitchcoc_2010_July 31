If one goes to an art gallery to see a provocative piece, one sees
something new each time. That&#x27;s what true art is. That&#x27;s why a black
light Elvis is not art. This film is certainly a tour de force. It
requires engagement at every step. LIke most works of art, it doesn&#x27;t
give it all away. I look forward to seeing this the second or even
third time. First of all, the premise is wonderfully engaging. Our
consciousness is layered as everyone knows who thinks they have
awakened, only to find themselves in another nightmare--then they
awaken again. We know that the subconscious by nature is out of our
control. There you have a wonderful premise. Now layer that further
with people who can flip in and out and use this to their own ends.
While confusing, it&#x27;s exciting. The amazing thing is that the
director/writer pulls it off. Every nuance and event is picked
precisely for its effectiveness. We have the luxury of watching from
one precipice into the abyss. We do care about the people and not just
because we want them to succeed. We care about the matrix of the dream
levels. Great movie.
