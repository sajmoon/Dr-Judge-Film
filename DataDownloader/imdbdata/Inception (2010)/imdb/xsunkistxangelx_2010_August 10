Honestly, this is my favorite movie of all time. <br /><br />But in order to fully understand the concept, you must be alert and pay
attention throughout the whole thing. <br /><br />What made the movie better was the fact that the main character was
played by Leonardo DiCaprio. His exceptional acting made you believe
you were part of the movie. <br /><br />Although the movie can get confusing at times, you must remember the
basic rules laid out in the beginning of the movie. <br /><br />There was action, drama, and even some comedy thrown in to make it more
entertaining. The concepts though up in this movie were unbelievable
and it made you wonder if you are really living in reality.<br /><br />I would recommend it to everyone basically, be sure to watch it in
theaters too, it looks better that way.
