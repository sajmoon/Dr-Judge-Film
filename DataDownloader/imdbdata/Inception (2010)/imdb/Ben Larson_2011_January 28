What makes this film is not the story, which is mysterious and
compelling, but the cast that was put together to make it happen.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio (Blood Diamond, The Aviator) is magnificent, but he
doesn&#x27;t carry the film on his own. He has an excellent cast supporting
him: Ellen Page (Juno), Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai),
Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy (Red Eye), Marion Cotillard (La Vie en
Rose), and Pete Postlethwaite in one of his last roles.<br /><br />It is a really heavy film, with unobstructed attention compelled. But,
you are rewarded with some great action sequences and special effects.<br /><br />Thrilling to the very end.
