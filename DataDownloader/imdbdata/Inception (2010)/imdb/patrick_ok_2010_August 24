In other circumstances I&#x27;d call this movie a nice roller-coaster action
ride, not great, but fun to watch.<br /><br />But with regard to a lot of seemingly competent film critics claiming
this movie to be the be all end all of what a brilliant movie can be,
it makes me kinda sad. It makes me really sympathize with all the
reviews here calling Inception dumb. But that&#x27;s the point, really, it&#x27;s
even a nice phrasing in my opinion. On the one hand I find it really
astonishing that some producers understood the NEED for deep,
challenging, meaningful movies. But instead of creating a thought
provoking movie they just produced one that looks like it, trying to
mimic the clues which make a movie seem deep... I&#x27;d phrase that
perverted.<br /><br />Otherwise I don&#x27;t have to add much to what has already been posted
here. The topic of dreams has a lot of potential but instead Inception
constrains it to a small logical prison which neither has any reference
to real neuolobiogical science nor does it take on the endless creative
possibilities of what dreams are about. Anyone who has some memories of
dreams or experience with lucid dreaming will know.<br /><br />Since I loved Memento I&#x27;m flabbergasted. I think Nolan&#x27;s able to do way
better and stand for clever movies. But not with Inception. I know
about taste and how everyone has another one and such... but imaging a
scenario of future &#x22;brilliant&#x22; movies and how they&#x27;d take Inception as
a role model, how marketing tries to mock terms like &#x22;clever&#x22; and
&#x22;thought provoking&#x22;, with thousands of pseudo-intellectual movies
spreading all over the world. And in the end no one knows anymore when
you really can expect an engaging movie - that&#x27;s NOT the future I&#x27;d
like to see. Insofar : Inception: Dumb. Thank you.<br /><br />Would the author of Inception only have listened to its own script:
&#x22;Don&#x27;t be afraid to dream of something big.&#x22;
