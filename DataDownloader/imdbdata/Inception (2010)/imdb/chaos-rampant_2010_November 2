I wonder how many different ways will Nolan find around making a heist
movie. Whereas the average heist film basically makes a statement that
hits a mark around &#x22;crime doesn&#x27;t pay&#x22;, a Nolan film at some point
feels the need to peel back the heist film as an irrelevancy that no
longer serves a purpose to give us catharsis and soaring emotional
crescendos. Yet he makes his catharsis the same way he makes his heist
movie framing devices, mechanical and calculated and &#x27;movie-like&#x27;.<br /><br />For all the hoo hah of philosophical ambition about boxes inside boxes,
this is still a movie where a plot is set in motion by characters
saying things like &#x22;we had to deliver Saito&#x27;s expansion plans to Cobol
Engineering two hours ago&#x22; and where a team is assembled to work for
&#x22;some very very powerful people&#x22;. In all this furrore the make juvenile
mistakes. The heir to the most powerful energy conglomerate in the
world apparently flies to Los Angeles not in his personal jet but on an
airline owned by his competitor. The movie hinges its believability in
abstract stratagems like &#x22;the subject&#x27;s mind can always trace the
genesis of that idea&#x22;.<br /><br />Like Shutter Island, I am bothered by this type of film that purports
to speak at profound length about dreams and their mechanics, yet seems
to understand nothing at all about dream logic. In Shutter Island
dreams are tableaux of carefully constructed symbolism, detail planned
in all the right spots to mean something. Inception is even less;
dreams are vistas/levels of real world abstracted to a small degree.
When a van tumbles over a bridge, the people dreaming inside that van
find themselves bumping about in their dream! Where Scorsese&#x27;s movie
allowed for itself the failsafe of being able to claim that it&#x27;s all a
pastiche of 50&#x27;s detective mysteries, Inception is a Nolan film so it
must take itself thoroughly serious at every turn.<br /><br />The Nolans are really masters of film structuralism, I can&#x27;t take that
away from them nor do I want to, they excel in this. They are great
architects who make boxes carefully fit within other boxes, an
elaborate maze to lose the viewer in, but their idea of trascending box
and maze is to the force the viewer into submission by sheer volume of
plot detail. I like how we&#x27;re given fragments of images that pay off
later but at the same time can&#x27;t help but feel that, outside the
mechanics of it, when it comes to emotional response, those fragments
never really challenge our expectations. For more than two hours, Nolan
symbolizes Leo&#x27;s guilt on leaving a family behind by showing him unable
to dream/remember the faces of his children, always seeing their backs.
In the end he does, yet, again seemingly through that architectural
need to create another narrative box, the film ends on the ambiguous
note &#x22;is this another dream?&#x22; that betrays the emotional response of
the character seeing his children&#x27;s faces.<br /><br />What annoys me most about this is two things though. That the movie
seems content to give the impression that a villain, like a Minotaur in
the far end of a labyrinth, inhabits the lowest level of the dream,
closed in a hotel room of broken furniture, or a bleak cityscape of
concrete buildings without features, and even characters who should
know better refer to it in the third person like it actually exists
down there as something more than a figment of Leo&#x27;s subconscious.<br /><br />And more importantly, that Nolan creates a very elaborate system of
dreams within dreams and simultaneous narratives that hinge on the idea
that dream time is condensed (I find this fascinating, that entire
lives can be played out in the span of time it takes a van to tumble
over a bridge), yet he only fills those boxes with the most banal and
unimaginative action set pieces. Dream levels are in turns hazy aimless
blurs of something that is very gray and very rainy, of characters
running around in orangecolored corridors, of characters running around
in the snow shooting guns at each other.<br /><br />I&#x27;m not sure that Nolan could make a better movie even if he didn&#x27;t
have blockbuster expectations to fulfill or financial investments to
protect, even with the ridiculous actions trimmed out, a dream version
of Memento would not warrant Kubrick comparisons. For a generation that
wasn&#x27;t old enough to take the red pill ten years ago this should serve
as a Matrix for the new decade, but when it comes to meaningfully
capturing what it feels like to dream no one has yet to even rival
Lynch.
