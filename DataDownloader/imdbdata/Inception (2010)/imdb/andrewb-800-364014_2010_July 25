If you are about ten years old and like ridiculous far fetched plots
this movie is for you. I read the first glowing review and I am
wondering what planet the reviewer is from. The plot is a mess, the
special effects are lame and the whole think stinks. Don&#x27;t waste you
money..it is worth $1 when it comes out on Red Box but even this
assumes you are desperate for a distraction. I was thoroughly
disappointed in Decaprio&#x27;s acting and the story line screams a
desperate attempt at trying to do something different rather than
crafting a good movie. The child actress female lead...looks to be
about 15 years old is totally miscast. She does not do herself justice
when compared to her role and acting Juno. Finally the plot seems to
have been padded to make the movie fill time. At the end they seem to
have run out of budget and simply don&#x27;t explain how Decaprio is saved
or saves himself or something. Stupid stupid stupid.
