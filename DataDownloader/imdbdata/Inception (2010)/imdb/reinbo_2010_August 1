I saw it last week and really don&#x27;t get the hype. OK, the idea is nice,
but the movie itself is just like any other Mission Impossible of
Oceans Eleven franchise. It is a boring heist movie. Apart from that
the characters are lame. DiCaprio plays the same person as in Shutter
Island and the action scenes are completely out dated. I thought I was
Watching an Bond movie from the 80&#x27;s from time to time. And why did
they have to explain everything. I&#x27;m not stupid. Just a quick run
through and we could have started. Nolan took over an hour to explain
everything..... Why. No I also did not like Memento, so maybe Nolan&#x27;s
puzzles are not my cup of tea<br /><br />No, this movie is not what I had hoped.
