Let me first by saying Inception skin deep is a 10/10 and is beautiful.
But deep within the shell of hype is a movie that is still good but
lacking at the same time. To all the people Who ultimately love the
movie I see reviews like,&#x22;Couldn&#x27;t wait to see this&#x22; &#x22;Masterpiece?&#x22;
&#x22;Insanely Intelligent&#x22; which just makes the movie reviewer seem very
naive. To all the people who ultimately hate the movie, they always say
things like &#x22;I hate Christopher Nolan&#x22; &#x22;This movie is a ***** waste of
time&#x22; etc. Which then makes me believe that those people just have
something against Christopher Nolan.<br /><br />In my opinion I saw the movie as nothing but a Hollywood movie. It was
mildly entertaining and the cast was just a big name with no giant
steps in their acting skills. I saw no hard acting parts besides them
being themselves trying to talk about &#x22;logical things&#x22;.<br /><br />The Reason this movies was mildly entertaining was due to the fact that
the storyline wasn&#x27;t as fresh as people say it is and the editing I saw
to try to cram in a dream within a dream between movie scenes was just
&#x22;Bleh&#x22;. <br /><br />I have seen too many movies that skew the whole concept of reality and
dreams and quite frankly this one didn&#x27;t make me think too hard. Did
they have to use pretty CGI? Did they have to have giant gun scenes?
no. Of course this movie could of been way better if it wasn&#x27;t
&#x22;Hollywoodized&#x22; and dumbed down to make everyone interested with action
CGI and less talking about things that really needed to be talked about
to avoid plot holes. Instead they just kept explaining the concept in a
repetitious measure and never explained other things. Like for
instance, the machine the Architect created. (&#x22;Architect&#x22; rofl Matrix
again) I hate to compare, like most people, but I would have to say
that matrix (the first) beats this. The matrix created a universe aside
from a concept and also had a foundation to where something originated.
In this movie they treated everything so calmly yet everything was so
insignificant due to everything being a dream? (Sound confusing and
irrational? Tell me about it) What you know and who you know is
insignificant and the movie is a continuous Dream, in a Dream, in a
Dream that was just piled together to make me think. Is this a Dream?
That isn&#x27;t very exciting to me. I am not over thinking. I am just not
chasing a very uninteresting rabbit down a hole.<br /><br />I have seen it once, it was fun, its in the past. It has a 20% chance
of me buying it on DVD when it comes out and it will soon be forgotten
by me. There are more movies out there that blow my mind with their
concepts then this one did. It was just a fancy effect, semi action,
simple concept movie.
