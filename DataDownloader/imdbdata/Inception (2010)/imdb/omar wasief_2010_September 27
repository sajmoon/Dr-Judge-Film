As his career evolves, Christopher Nolan is establishing himself as
multiple things&#x97;among them, a director who&#x27;s willing to push the
envelope and doesn&#x27;t shy away from challenges, a man with an incredibly
creative mind, and someone who&#x27;s more interested in technical wizardry
than generating sheer emotion through traditional means. This last
point is true in multiple ways: sure, Nolan loves using extravagant
cinematic techniques (which is not to suggest that he&#x27;s a gimmicky
filmmaker), as illustrated by Memento&#x27;s (2000) wildly imaginative
editing. But he&#x27;s also drawn to trickery and mind games as topic
matter: from his unique debut, Following (1999), about a writer who
follows strangers to spark his creative process, to The Prestige
(2006), which zeros in on dueling magicians trying to one-up the other.
And his Batman duo&#x97;Batman Begins (2005), and The Dark Knight
(2008)&#x97;focus heavily on psychology, especially The Dark Knight&#x27;s epic
battle between the Caped Crusader and The Joker. So it&#x27;s no surprise
that he&#x27;d eventually be drawn to a literal examination of the mind and,
to a lesser extent, our current obsession with technology and gaming
with his latest, Inception, which has been talked up to crazy heights
and showcases the best, as well as the most problematic, aspects of
Nolan&#x27;s directorial chops.
