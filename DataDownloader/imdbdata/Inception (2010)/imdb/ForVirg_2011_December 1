I have long considered Hans Zimmer an underutilized soundtrack
composer, because, until now, his talent has not been given full rein
to move the viewing audience to the emotional depths of which he is
capable.<br /><br />Inception unleashes that ability, in much the way the character of Dom
seeks a supremely talented &#x22;dream architect.&#x22; Nowhere is this more
evident than when Zimmer&#x27;s score plays during the closing few
sequences, with no dialogue. These minutes are, in my mind, a
demonstration of the ideal application of music in film, and I loudly
applaud the filmmakers for this decision to let emotion, riding on the
powerful waves of music, finish the story. <br /><br />After all, many of us are not stupid, and we know what is happening
without constant verbal exposition. Having seen Inception several times
now, I still sob uncontrollably during this extremely powerful ending.
That speaks volumes when one knows it is far more common for me to be
sneeringly sarcastic by the end of a movie.<br /><br />As delightful as this is, however, it is, I am pleased to say, only a
portion of what makes this movie work for a rather wide audience. <br /><br />First and foremost, the script tells a story that gives viewers of
different experiences and age groups different things to think about.
On the surface, it has its fair share of action and shoot-em-up scenes.
But ultimately, for more mature viewers, the film has a lot to say
about interpersonal interaction, and the ultimate place of relationship
in reality, as opposed to the virtual kind (whether in dream states or
on Facebook and other social media). <br /><br />In this sense, Christopher Nolan has clearly matured as a writer and
director.<br /><br />Then there is the acting. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers an excellent
performance. Like Nolan, DiCaprio has matured, and as he has, he became
an authentic actor, not just a &#x22;star.&#x22; <br /><br />The genius of this film with regard to the acting, however, is the
sparse use of big names, and the copious addition of incredibly
talented character actors -- those people whose names may not be
household words, but who pack an unrivaled punch of talent. <br /><br />After all, shouldn&#x27;t a truly good actor actually cause us to &#x22;know&#x22;
different characters in different films, and not their individual
persona over and over again? This is Inception&#x27;s serious fodder, and
why so many of the film&#x27;s actors are multiple Oscar nominees, even if
not common names in People Magazine. <br /><br />There is also the intelligent use of special effects. Unlike so many
modern films, the CG departments here didn&#x27;t waste their talents with
clich&#xE9;d scenes of actors in slow motion martial arts moves, instead
opting for judicious enhancement of the visual texture of the film. It
is appropriate special effects, not merely CG for the sake of CG. <br /><br />The appeal of classic films, for so many thinking film connoisseurs, is
the way a well-executed script will take root in your mind and haul you
along into the magnificent journey of a unique tale. <br /><br />With the advent of modern technology pandering to nanosecond attention
spans, too many filmmakers have lost the ability (or willingness) to
relate a good story visually, relying instead on mere &#x22;eye candy&#x22;.
While special effects can wow an audience, just because we can do
something doesn&#x27;t mean we should. Inception gets this idea (this and
the prior reference intended, which is understood once the movie is
seen) and applies it exceedingly well. <br /><br />I will admit I almost gave up on this movie half way through the first
viewing. By the end I was beyond relieved I had not. Somewhere along
the way this movie grabbed hold and wouldn&#x27;t let me go. It turned out
to be one of those films that one thinks about for hours after
watching, and, like a good classic, has me returning again and again to
catch the subtle ways in which the story unfolds scene to scene --
dialogue and visuals which may not be noticed until all is revealed.
I&#x27;ve now watched it three times in less than a month. I&#x27;ve not watched
even Casablanca that frequently. <br /><br />So if Inception seems silly or trite upon your first viewing, I implore
you to hang in there. If you value good stories and thought-provoking,
suspenseful tales, I predict you&#x27;ll change your mind before the end.
The second viewing is even better, now that you know what is going on
early in the film. <br /><br />In fact, unlike many lesser films, I have only one serious quarrel with
this movie, and it is relatively minor. It occurs early on, when
DiCaprio&#x27;s character says to Ellen Page&#x27;s character, in the middle of a
sentence, that &#x22;they say we only use a small percentage of our
brains...&#x22; Science has thoroughly debunked this particular bit of
nonsense, and I sincerely wish the spread of this myth would stop.
Given the terribly bad opinion I have held of most films made since
about the early 60&#x27;s, this is such a minor error that I almost forgive
myth-spreading. <br /><br />This film is a minimum TWO-TIME must see, as it offers some new
interesting morsel of thought each time around. It is what good cinema
should be -- a fascinating tale well told in every way.
