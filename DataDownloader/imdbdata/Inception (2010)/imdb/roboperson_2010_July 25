Right Now, i am completely speechless of Christopher Nolan&#x27;s new film
called &#x27;Inception&#x27;, a film about where entering into other peoples
dreams is possible.<br /><br />Comparing it to The Dark Knight and Inception is almost equally great,
because of its same atmosphere and emotions. But Inception goes higher
with its more bigger than life special effects, background setting and
also with its mind-bending twists at the end.<br /><br />So for me, Inception is not just a great film or a film of the decade,
but Inception was the movie i have been waiting for my life. Almost
like a adrenaline-packed roller-coaster ride. Just life-changing.
