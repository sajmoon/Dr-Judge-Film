2010_August 7 
Like most people I love movies, and I have watched the majority of
IMDb&#x27;s top 250 movies over the course of my life. Everyone has their
own personal favorites based on their life experiences and their
ability to connect with the different aspects of a film.<br /><br />For me, Inception connected on almost every level more than any other
film has. The musical score was the best I&#x27;ve heard since 2001: A Space
Odyssey or Amadeus. The story, especially the Cobb/Mal/children aspect,
was the most emotionally resonate for me since The Shawshank
Redemption. The story was also the most captivating and interesting of
any movie I have seen. The action sequences (largely due to the
connection with the characters) were more intense and visceral than any
I have seen. The Hotel Hallway action sequence in particular was the
most visually stunning any film has ever had.<br /><br />On an emotional level, this movie connected with me very strongly due
to events taking place in my life right at the moment it was released.
I can understand some of the reviewers who really like the movie, but
couldn&#x27;t connect with the emotional aspects of the story if they have
never experienced anything very similar. Thankfully the movie is so
perfect in every aspect that even if you are not able to enjoy the film
on an emotional level, you will almost certainly love all or most of
the other aspects.<br /><br />Along with Memento, this is the only film I have needed to use any
brainpower to keep up with. With that said, it was not too complicated
to understand the overall story even after only one viewing. Thankfully
the movie is so enjoyable and there are many fun little details, so it
is a very good movie for repeat viewing. <br /><br />It would be easy to nitpick this movie like with any other, and it
would be easy to boost your ego by saying it is not as smart as most
people say it is, but the fact is that this movie is as unique, new and
intelligent as any film that has been made. There has never been a
movie that has completely new concepts. Every aspect of human nature is
learned from other humans, and movies are the same way. The best a
human can do is put together what he knows in a unique and thought
provoking way, and that is what Nolan has done.
