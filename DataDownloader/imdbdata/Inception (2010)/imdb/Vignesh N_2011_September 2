Awesome. Very well thought out and well directed classic. I wonder how
the story-writer got such an idea; it really amazes me. In certain
places, I had to literally pause the movie, think &#x26; figure out what is
happening and resume it - this movie will be loved by anyone who
understands it completely. Even the subtlest things like the &#x27;totem&#x27; is
good. <br /><br />This guy DiCaprio is too good at what he does. I think this is the
second movie I am watching of Chris after &#x27;Memento&#x27; - will surely watch
rest of his movies after this. About the Climax, well what can I say -
magnificent. I might as well have had many goosebumps here and there
during the movie - tends to happen with a very few movies.<br /><br />I loved it. To me, this is &#x27;The Best&#x27; movie of 2010.
