there are a lot of reasons why I didn&#x27;t like Inception. to begin with
the fact I was disappointed in the story, I find this the worst movie
since Shutter Island. but that&#x27;s no coincidence! what&#x27;s the link
between Inception and Shutter Island? Leonardo DiCaprio! wait... does
this mean Dicaprio only acts in bad movies? no, because Leonardo
DiCaprio can act, even though he always does the same thing and looks
the same way he did in the last picture you&#x27;ve seen with him. it only
means DiCaprio chooses to work on promising films that end up as no
good. and why is Inception a bad picture? now here&#x27;s the point! it&#x27;s a
stupid picture, with no mystery in it at all! am I joking?off course
I&#x27;m not! the so called twists in the end are easy to come up with, so
that when the clues are shown during the show, you can easily guess
what they will turn out to be. what we really should be asking
ourselves is this: if I had the choice between a James Bond movie and
Inception, which one of the two would you prefer to see? answer: the
James Bond movie. however, this is not the case with other movies
directed by Christopher Nolan! Bond versus The Prestige? Bond loses.
the same with The Dark Knight or Memento. and here&#x27;s why: Inception is
deception, because it&#x27;s no good movie. I rest my case. I hate
Inception. you like it? okay, tell me why.
