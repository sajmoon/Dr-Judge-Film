Firstly, I&#x27;ll admit that I only went to see this because 1. Leo
DiCaprio is in it, and I have a VERY soft spot for him :) and 2. My
brother also wanted to see it. So I went along, expecting some nice Leo
eye-candy and gun fights. Nothing more. <br /><br />This film was AMAZING! I absolutely loved it. It had everything in it:
outstanding acting, an excellent score, mind blowing special effects
and a very intricate, detailed plot. There was exactly the right
balance of drama/Leo and action/guns , making it an ideal film for
either gender. The film was so clever, and I was absolutely glued to
the screen the whole time. I was overwhelmed, because it was so much
better than what I was expecting. In my opinion, this film is very
underrated, and I believe that it is by far the best film of the
decade, maybe even the century. The only bad thing that is if you&#x27;re
slow like me, you may need to watch it a few times to fully understand
the plot, but I&#x27;m not complaining. I was also very disappointed that
this didn&#x27;t make the number 1 or 2 spot on the IMDb top 250, because it
should be there. Absolutely. <br /><br />So if you haven&#x27;t seen it, make it your top priority, because this film
is definitely a classic :)
