My first review on IMDb and i thought there would be no better film to
review than Inception, the film is simply brilliant in every way, it
deserves a 10 out of 10 and to be at the top with the greats and
classics. Christopher Nolan once again shows you why he is one of the
best directors about at the moment and his collaboration with Hans
Zimmer and his superb film score, pores so much emotion into the film.
As for the cast, you cant fault any and there performances are
flawless. Im not going to go on too much but i would advise anyone who
is yet to see this, to make sure you do! <br /><br />&#x27;Your mind is the scene of the crime.&#x27;
