Like many other out there who have been reading about all the hype
Inception has been bringing the World Wide Web, and possible your
friends, I got to the movie theater as soon as I could to watch it. And
let me tell you, this movie has a whole new twist. It is not a &#x22;cookie
cutter&#x22; plot, it doesn&#x27;t have a theme you have found in another movie,
it is just flat out unique and amazing. (No wonder it took Nolan 8
years to release it!) The acting in this film is just flat out
outstanding. After watching Cillian Murphy in &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22; and
&#x22;Batman Begins&#x22;, it was hard to picture him acting in any other type of
role. But this film just pushed the bar up a few more levels! He does
an exceptional job with this film! Don&#x27;t even get me started with
DiCaprio&#x27;s performance. You can just expect that to be great, and let
me tell you, IT IS.<br /><br />Nolan choice to pick actors from the Batman Series (Michael Caine and
Cillian Murphy) was a risky one. Its hard to picture these actors in
another type of role after watching the Batman Series, especially the
number of times I have re-watched them. But nonetheless, High Risk =
High Reward, and without a doubt is this one a high reward.<br /><br />This movie will literally Blow you away. Its worth every penny. I
watched the movie in 2D, and it was great. Take your family (Thats what
I did! Everyone Loved it!) It will be a great experience, and if you
don&#x27;t decide to go see it yourself, I bet someone eventually will make
you.<br /><br />Oh and trust me, you&#x27;ll have a hard time falling asleep and dreaming in
the movie theater with this film ;]
