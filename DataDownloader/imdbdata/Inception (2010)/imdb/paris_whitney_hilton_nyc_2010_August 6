2010_August 6 
I am not going to discuss any particular event or reveal the beginning
or ending to this two and a half hour ear &#x26; butt buster . However , I
will warn anyone from walking into the theater unaware of what the
storyline is about . I saw Shutter Island and really enjoyed DiCaprio&#x27;s
performance despite some negative reviews it got from professional
critics . ...... So I paid my $12 bucks and bought a ticket for
Inception and walked in without knowing what to expect . I thought this
film would be more of a psychological thriller but I was mistaken . I
found myself trying to play catch-up with this confusing plot from
start to finish . I remember seeing people floating around in zero
gravity, machine guns blazing , bombs exploding , buildings collapsing
, numerous car crashes , and lots and lots of chase scenes , fights,
falls, and natural disasters . Just about everything you would expect
to see in any big budget summer action flick . By the time this long
movie ended I couldn&#x27;t have cared less . As I exited the theater I
looked at the faces of my fellow movie goers . No one commented on how
good it was or how much it stunk . They just looked relieved this
unnecessarily long nightmare was over and quietly left . Most people
here who took the time to review this picture apparently were not
disappointed as I was . So I guess I&#x27;m in the minority of unhappy of
Inception reviewers . If I could re-edit this movie I would 1) Chop off
one hour . 2) Remove all dialog . 3) Speed up the film . 4) Change the
soundtrack to that of The Benny Hill Show . ......... The next time I
feel in need of another nightmare adventure I think I&#x27;ll take an Ambien
and hop in my clothes dryer .. I gave this movie a 4 because of some
really good special effects ... ( Not so Hot ) ... P.W.H.
