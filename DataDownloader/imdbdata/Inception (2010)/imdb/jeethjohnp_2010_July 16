A movie these day seldom makes one think about it once we exit the
theatre hall. This one does. And never does any movie makes its viewer
go back through the reels while in the hall this many times. Yes, this
is by far the most intellectual film I have ever seen. Story is very
simple. It is about an extraction master who needs to do the exact
opposite of his profession: Plant an idea in a person&#x27;s mind to bring
about a favorable result for his client. What follows is a heist
thriller that is complex, thrilling, and high on steroids. It is like a
web. It is very easy to get entangled and create a mess in your mind.
But Nolan has executed the order of scenes in such a manner that the
viewer gets enlightened slow and steady. It is like sitting in a class
where one gets taught the basics of everything. Once this is done it is
application of these theories to reality. That&#x27;s when the real test
starts. If the basics didn&#x27;t get through into your mind, it is a
daunting task to get what is going on in the application stage. It is a
beautifully designed web actually. I understood that on my second
viewing. With added visuals, Hans Zimmer&#x27;s background score and the
grasp of the going on&#x27;s gives goosebumps. It is one hell of a ride and
this is the effect that is similar to what one gets after smoking a
joint. Your mind goes on a ride with no limits. It is like looking in
the mirror in a barber shop:Dream within a dream. There is immense
scope to go to any places with this story. But the success of this
movie lies in the fact, that Nolan never took the action sequences
over-the-top like all the blockbuster&#x27;s try to do these days. He wanted
to make us go &#x27;wow&#x27; just by the sheer brilliance of what is coming out
of his mind. Yes he had the intentions of playing with our mind. And he
has done that very masterfully. This is the work of a genius and it
should not be missed at any cost.
