&#x22;Inception&#x22; might have been a better movie -- and would certainly have
been more entertaining -- had writer/director Christopher Nolan not
made his premise so complicated that the film had to spend its entire
2:25 running time explaining itself to its audience.<br /><br />Seriously, the exposition Never. Stops. There were literally moments
during action sequences where one character would pause and explain
what was going on to another character, which of course was a
ham-fisted way of explaining it to us. But even with all of that
aggressive exposition, the movie never does make a lot of sense. The
result is a lot of busyness -- oh, there&#x27;s always plenty of stuff going
on -- that&#x27;s nevertheless pretty boring because it&#x27;s never clear what
all of the busyness is for.<br /><br />Nolan has done this to us before. Who the hell came out of &#x22;The
Prestige&#x22; with any clue what that movie was about? And even his more
narratively coherent films (like &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22;) suffer from a lack
of humor and a burden of philosophical pondering that the premises
can&#x27;t support. &#x22;Inception&#x22; is no exception (ha!). The movie is junk
trying to disguise itself as something important and significant. How
much more fun it would have been if it had just been content to be
junk.<br /><br />Grade: C-
