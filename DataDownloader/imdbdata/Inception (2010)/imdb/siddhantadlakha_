Dom Cobb leads a highly skilled team, specializing in stealing secrets
from people&#x27;s minds by entering their dreams. When they are hired by a
mysterious businessman, Cobb finally has a shot at redemption, but not
before achieving the near impossible. Rather than stealing an idea,
they must do the complete opposite: Inception. Planting the seed of an
idea.<br /><br />Inception has a multi-layered plot, quite literally in fact. It focuses
on the emotional journey of its lead character, Cobb, but at the same
time thrusts the audience into multiple levels of action packed story-
telling, very distinct from one another, but all finely connected. It
has been described by critics as &#x22;a film that rewards intellect&#x22;, and I
can assure you that it is exactly that. Director Christopher Nolan
challenges the audience to keep up, and rewards those who can with a
breathtaking spectacle, one that has the capability to leave you
awestruck. The best part about it is that while you may feel you need
to watch it again to be able to fully absorb the experience, chances
are, you will probably want to.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan brings his unique vision to the screen with the help
of a star-studded cast, including the likes of Leonardo Dicaprio (The
Departed), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (500 Days Of Summer), Ellen Page
(Juno), Marion Cotillard (Public Enemies), Cillian Murphy (Batman
Begins), and Michael Caine (The Dark Knight), as well some amazing
photography by long time collaborator Wally Pfister. The thrilling
music in the film is provided by none other than Hans Zimmer, who was
also set the mood for Nolan&#x27;s previous film, The Dark Knight.<br /><br />While it may seem simple at its outset, Inception is an extremely
complex film, delving deep into the subconscious of the human mind.
Technical brilliance and visual splendor have rarely blended together
as beautifully. The emotional depth and explosive action complement
each other perfectly, delivering a film that is at the same time both
heart- wrenching and heart-pounding. It&#x27;s a film that manages to
engross you with its complexities, yet comes together seamlessly, and
will have you at the edge of your seat, quite literally from start to
finish.<br /><br />Inception is magnificent.
