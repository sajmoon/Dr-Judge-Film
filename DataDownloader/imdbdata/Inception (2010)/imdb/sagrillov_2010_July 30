Inception: pointless mix . Nolan: absolutely _overrated_. DiCaprio:
same chewed gum. Conclusion: I want my money back.<br /><br />This is just utter bullshit really. And for sure nothing to be 9.2 ...
people should go back and see again real movies..please. <br /><br />Want a real inception? Fightclub, Matrix 1, and many others. But this
one? I can hear DiCaprio crying on the phone &#x27; I want to be like Keanu,
pleaseeeee&#x27;, so they put together this script in like what, couple of
weekends? and they get Nolan... the most overrated director ever... the
result speaks for itself... a pointless mix...at 3/4 of the movie ppl
where leaving the theater... dullness empire... <br /><br />bah.
