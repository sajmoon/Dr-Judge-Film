Inception- Highly anticipated and most satisfying.<br /><br />I had the pleasure of viewing this film last night at Canal Walk in
Cape Town and I must say that this film is one of the best I have ever
seen, the visuals, the story, the dreams and the heists were all
phenomenal.<br /><br />Although Christopher Nolan&#x27;s high intellectual script writing and
brilliant direction kept me intrigued throughout the film, there were a
few moments where I felt confused- It could have been the length of
some sequences which made me forget what had happened previously but it
didn&#x27;t take me long to get back on track with the storyline. Even
though this was the case, the film was still extremely enjoyable and
captivating in &#x27;the dream within a dream&#x27;.<br /><br />Leo DiCaprio gives a good performance, but it felt like he was holding
back a bit and I personally think that it was due to the complexity of
the writing that caused the actor to somewhat not give it his all. All
in all everyone gave an excellent performance, especially Ellen Page as
the architect.<br /><br />This could and probably is one of the best sci-fi action films since
The Matrix and it definitely has to go onto Nolan&#x27;s wall of
masterpieces, just like ALL his other films. Nolan&#x27;s direction and film
making skills are other worldly, he knows exactly what he&#x27;s doing and
he knows how to keep the audience intrigued. With Inception he plays
around with time so effortlessly and the projection of his vision on
screen is so clear that this film pulls you in, keeps you there for
2hours and 50 minutes and spits you out, leaving you fulfilled and
satisfied because you have just witnessed one of the greatest original
films of ALL TIME. &#x27;The Director who hasn&#x27;t made a single bad film?&#x27;-
This statement becomes more believable after every film he directs.<br /><br />When watching Inception, do not think of leaving your seat to go to the
toilet or to get some more popcorn or slush puppy, you will most
definitely come back confused and lost in a dream :).<br /><br />9 out of 10
