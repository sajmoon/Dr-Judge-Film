Heres The Basic Plot..<br /><br />Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is the most skilled extractor in the
world, he is able to access the mind at its most vulnerable state and
steal your very own secrets. Mr Saito (Ken Watanabe) offers Cobb his
one and only way home, back to his family, but he must do one last job,
Inception.. Cobb and his team have to plant an idea in Robert Fishers
head. (Cillian Murphy) They have to plant the idea in Roberts mind
which convinces him to break up his fathers empire. Cobb and his team
bring fisher down 3 levels, using his own subconscious projections
against himself. They time kicks for each dream level which wakes them
up in sync with each other.. Cobb and his team complete the Fisher
con.. But is Cobb still dreaming? Or has he returned to reality to his
children? Pure genius from director Christopher Nolan. I highly
recommend you see it! 10/10
