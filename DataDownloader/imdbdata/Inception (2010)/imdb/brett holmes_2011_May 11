i will start off by saying that I&#x27;m not a fan of DiCaprio&#x27;s work,but
that is not the reason why i didn&#x27;t like this movie.the special effects
are spot on but i just didn&#x27;t like the idea of the script, the acting
was almost lazy and forced,it seems to me that maybe DiCaprio is
getting worse with age (much like brad Pitt).of course when i viewed
this with a few mates they all loved it but i was left with a
headache.the script was all over the place and it was a little too
confusing and hard to keep track of. this was named as one of the best
movies of 2010 but i saw way better animated movie that year. do
yourself a favour and save your money and time.
