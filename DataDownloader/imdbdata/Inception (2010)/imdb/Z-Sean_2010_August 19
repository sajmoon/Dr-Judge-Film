Now this is how movies are supposed to be be. This is a movie...more
like a real movie. Chris Nolan did it again!!! Beautifully carried out
job. Amazing cast and acting......Joseph really steals the show!!! no
confusion b/w the steps of dreams, i didn&#x27;t get confused even one
single time. Cinematography and visual effects are
stunning.............. It is the most confusing and plot-twisting movie
ever to be such a big success........Warner Bros. kinda gambled 160
Million Dollars because it was not based on a book, comic book, or a
sequel or a remake or of video game....but i gotta tell
you....Inception speaks for itself. Chris Nolan has managed to tell the
story so amazingly that and keep us interested in movie the whole
time...............<br /><br />GO SE IT NOW!!!!!!!<br /><br />Without a doubt Chris Nolan&#x27;s best work........ Perfect and
flawless!!!! Well done, Christopher Nolan, Well DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
