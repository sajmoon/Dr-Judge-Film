From the moment that Spielberg scared millions of people from swimming
in the ocean: the blockbuster has become Hollywood&#x27;s bread and butter.
From the late 70&#x27;s to the new millennium, most of Hollywood&#x27;s
theatrical releases-- primarily caters to the fanboy/adolescent
audience. Gone are the days, that the adult audience is the target
demographic for Hollywood; nowadays-- for the most part-- adult theme
films are confined to the independent and to the foreign film scene.
The absence of adult oriented blockbusters, usually means that most of
the mainstream films are either mindless entertainment and/or do not
dare venturing in material that is provocative, controversial, or
profound.<br /><br />Despite the dominance of low brow blockbusters&#x85; once in awhile, emerge
blockbusters that blur the line between the blockbuster and the art
house. Films such as Children of Men, Collateral, and Zodiac are adult,
art house films with both a bigger budget and a more widespread
theatrical release.<br /><br />Ever since making an impact in film festivals with Following and
primarily with Memento, Christopher Nolan has been able to work in the
Hollywood system, while still managing to churn out films that are aim
at an adult audience. Does Inception continue Nolan&#x27;s trend of mixing
the art house with the blockbuster? Well&#x85; not really. &#x22;Not really&#x22;? Is
the answer yes or no? Inception&#x27;s major weakness is that it leans more
towards the blockbuster side than the art house side. Yes, the film has
an unorthodox structure and has creative, original sequences. Yet, it
leans more towards the blockbuster-- due to its inability to both
venture and dwell on the story&#x27;s darker aspects and on being subtle
when addressing its rules. In other words, Inception is too afraid of
offending a large segment of the audience; the film spends too much
time with exposition and with bombastic, action sequences than with
dealing with the protagonist&#x27;s existential crisis and with the
philosophical implications of both the technology and the moral
practice surrounding dream espionage and voyeurism.<br /><br />It does not mean that film should be avoided. On the contrary, the film
is a tour de force blockbuster. The acting is great, especially Tom
Hardy: who overshadows the other actors. Wally Pfister continues his
trend of delivering a recognizable, gorgeous cinematography. Hans
Zimmer&#x27;s score is fantastic&#x85;although, the film could have a deliver a
better sound design (on many occasions, it is difficult to discern the
dialogue). Unlike The Dark Knight, most of the action sequences are top
class; the hotel, action sequence is mind-blowing. Overall, it is a
well made blockbuster-- but it is not a masterpiece, and therefore,
nowhere near the top of Nolan&#x27;s filmography.<br /><br />Inception&#x27;s problem is not whether it is good or bad; Inception&#x27;s
problem is that it could have been a masterpiece. Instead of simply
being on par with The Matrix, Inception had the potential of being
Crime and Punishment in the dream world.
