Christopher Nolan is one of the most watched directors in Hollywood
today. Each of his movies makes him more and more popular. I am a huge
fan of his films and I believe Inception is his greatest work. Yes, The
Dark Knight was amazing, but I prefer to see original ideas. Inception
is the story of Domm Cobb (Leonardo Dicaprio) who specializes in the
art of extracting information from a subjects subconscious. When he is
accused of murdering his wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), he is forced to
run. He is offered a job for very powerful people that can clear his
name. He and his point man Aurthur (Joseph Gordon-Levvitt) assemble a
team and take on the job of planting an idea in the mind of an heir of
a major corporation.&#xA0;<br /><br />There are a lot of elements that make Inception...well...Inception. The
cast is truly amazing. Dicaprio can really capture the emotion of Cobb.
Tom Hardy (Eames) really made a name for himself with his role in the
movie. And this is Ellen Page (Ariadne) at her best. All of the
characters blend so well together, but are still very unique. The
relationships in this movie are so real and convincing. Each actor
captures all of the attitude, all the emotion, all of the intensity and
makes the scene what it is meant to be.&#xA0;<br /><br />The story itself is complex. Its not confusing; just complex.
Everything is explained so well. It made me feel like Inception was a
real thing. Just the basic thought that one idea can change someone&#x27;s
life; or that a dream can be the source of an idea, there&#x27;s so much
truth in what Nolan had to say. It&#x27;s amazing that no one thought of it
before.&#xA0;<br /><br />Nolan is one of the very few who has enough respect for film to keep it
in 2D. The cinematography (done by Wally Pfister) is so clean. Each
shot focuses on what it needs to and nothing more. There are some shots
that i had never seen before. The scene transition and intensity of the
movie work hand in hand. This is also true about the film score, but I
would expect nothing less from Hans Zimmer.&#xA0;<br /><br />Usually when I review movies, I try to find the positives and
negatives; for Inception, I just couldn&#x27;t do it. Everything was so
perfect and worked so well. Some critics have said it the dream world
was not enough like a dream. My answer to that is that if Christopher
Nolan changed it, the end would not have been so mind bending. That&#x27;s
another great thing about Inception: the ending is limited only to what
you imagine it to be. I look forward to seeing what Nolan has planned
for the future.&#xA0;
