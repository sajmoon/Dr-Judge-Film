First of all I&#x27;ve only seen this movie twice in theater &#x26; i feel like i
barely deserve 2 write this review since it feels like an never ending
dream that you can&#x27;t fathom. Lenardo Dicaprio has truly become the best
actor of the past 5 years between Inception Shutter Island
Revolutionary Road Body of Lies &#x26; Departed. These all started showing
his emotional depth &#x26; turmoil with reality of the outside world.
Revolutionary Road really started him on an almost unconcievable
reality vs dreamlike state. Inception really shows where he has been
able 2 act perfectly fine but somehow be able 2 allow himself be
attacked easily &#x26; allow others 2 see the pain he&#x27;s going through. Ellen
page has become the true doll and wondering beauty that i hoped she
would grow into, shes become more than just a teen movie star &#x26; in this
she showed how she can assess others weaknesses &#x26; try 2 help them
before they lose their mind as Dicapprio does but barely shows it. The
movie worked for me on the emotional level, logic level, visual, &#x26; just
was a true mind bending movie that eats @ you. The movie can never
truly be assessed when you&#x27;re watching since you&#x27;ll miss one o the many
levels of exposed elements &#x26; there&#x27;s just so much @ each of the 4
levels in the stages o sleep they have to break into.<br /><br />My favorite part of the whole movie was the spinning little top that
showed when one was in someone else&#x27;s dream. Now i don&#x27;t think anyone
can truly have a spoiler since no one really knows what this fabricated
dream means. What i gather is that Dicaprio is always in some form of
his wife&#x27;s created dreamland. Now he wasn&#x27;t when they were trying 2
plant an idea, for inception. But he can&#x27;t distinguish what she wants
for him truly, and the ending &#x26; beginning link itself in a weird way
but i think does it perfectly. The last 5 minutes are my fave part
since none of my friends will admit that I&#x27;m right. The truth is
staring us right in the face, you just have to think from the
standpoint of his wife Cotillard, a deserving Oscar for her role. Pay
attention 2 her words towards the end. The other actors all deserve
quite a nod for this awesome fights( Levitt), goofy charm (Tom Hardy) &#x26;
mafia hard sternness (Ken Watanabe). I don&#x27;t go a day without thinking
about this movie. This truly is like a disease that you can&#x27;t stop
dreaming and thinking about.
