If you choose to watch this film, let me warn you: it is NOT for the
average movie-goer. It is complex, urging the audience to remember what
scene just passed. It uses psychological terms, hoping that the
audience is intelligent enough to understand where it is going.<br /><br />If you can pass all of those tests, then you will immensely enjoy this
film. I don&#x27;t know where to begin describing it. If you want me to
start with the score, I&#x27;ll simply say it is flawless. Although music
may have been overplayed (downplaying the ambiguity of particular
scenes) Hanz Zimmer should enter the ranks of Mozart and Beethoven with
it. The action is smoothly directed, and Nolan proves to be improving
exponentially. <br /><br />The acting couldn&#x27;t have been better. I didn&#x27;t scoff at any poorly made
comment because they didn&#x27;t occur. Every word spoken was for a purpose
and not one second of screen time was wasted. Brilliant performances of
Leo DiCaprio for demonstrating his deep dedication to the role; Joseph
Gordon-Levitt is an up and coming actor with much promise; same goes
with Ellen Page, Tom Hardy (the amazing Bronson); Ken Watanabe; Cilian
Murphy; Marion Cotillard; and all others. Especially with DiCaprio&#x27;s
character, Cobb. Just mesmerizing.<br /><br />(POSSIBLE SPOILERS) But the component I am eager to boast is the drama.
Whoever says this movie has no emotion has clearly not contemplated the
delicacy of familial bonds. What drives the main character, Cobb, is
his love for his family. Nolan makes this movie a love story
intertwined into the vastly complex universe of the mind and
subconscious. How did he do it? Simple: spend 10 years composing the
script, and you might, too, come up with a geniusly crafted work. <br /><br />&#x22;Inception&#x22; and the famous quote about the &#x22;idea as parasite&#x22; play at
the backbone of the plot, and its final result is not only a warning of
an idea&#x27;s power, but an example that an original idea can change the
world. I believe that this film will change people&#x27;s minds about their
own dreams, and thus the global population have made one step closer to
being more attuned to themselves- thanks to Christopher Nolan.
