2011_July 3 
I have seen many great movies and i have seen this movie, but it was
not up to my standards. The plot was a little confusing (when i say a
little, i mean a lot) but on the lighter side the fight scenes were
good so were the actors that participated like Leonardo DiCaprio
(really awesome actor he was in Blood Diamond, and of course
Titanic)there was also Pete Postlethwaite (who died recently, you would
of seen him in Jurassic Park and The Usual Suspects)that is not all
Michael Caine got a role in this movie and i am sure everyone knows of
his work. 3/10. (-7/10 because of the plot) I recommend you still watch
it no matter what i said, or what other people said because everybody
has there own opinions. Kind regards, ben-james300
