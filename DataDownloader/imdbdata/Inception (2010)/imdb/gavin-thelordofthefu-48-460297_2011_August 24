My mother was expecting a family-movie to watch. I went to my movie
shelf and looked for appropriate movie to watch and just when I was
about to give up, I&#x27;ve finally chosen Inception, directed by
Christopher Nolan who did the critically acclaimed smash hits &#x22;Batman
Begins&#x22; and &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22;.<br /><br />Let&#x27;s just say I saw it not only at the same year it came out, but
somewhere during the summer last year and I don&#x27;t feel like reviewing
the plot since we already heard about it before like a few times.<br /><br />I mean, it is that good I just want to watch it over and over again. It
has a fantastic cast of actors that were very entertaining, the visuals
were astounding, the CGI effects were amazing, the soundtrack from Hans
Zimmer was solid, and even the action scenes were great. Let&#x27;s not
forget the emotional scene where Cobb confesses to his wife Mal about
her world not being real was very touching. The premise about dreaming
in reality was very creative for a sci-fi action movie.<br /><br />Inception is one of the best movies from the year 2010. In fact, it&#x27;s
one of the best movies of all time, period.<br /><br />A solid 5 out of 5.
