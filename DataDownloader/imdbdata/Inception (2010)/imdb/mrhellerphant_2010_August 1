Directed By: Christopher Nolan Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph
Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Michael Caine<br /><br />What It&#x27;s All About:<br /><br />Dom Cobb is an extractor, a man who enters the dreams of others to
steal information that would otherwise be inaccessible. After the death
of his wife which cost him his family and his nationality, he is
offered a chance to get his life back. The catch is rather than
extracting information, he needs to plant an idea in a corporate
target&#x27;s mind, otherwise known as Inception.<br /><br />The Final Verdict:<br /><br />Movies very rarely live up to expectations, let alone surpass them
which is the case with Christopher Nolan&#x27;s latest film Inception.
Thought provoking, thrilling and utterly gorgeous, Nolan delivers yet
another first class film with the help of DiCaprio as a more than
capable leading man. A film that will keep you thinking long after you
leave the cinema, my only criticism is the weakness in Ellen Page&#x27;s
performance which lets the film down somewhat. Otherwise this is the
must see film of 2010.<br /><br />9/10
