Without a doubt, Movie of the decade.<br /><br />10 / 10 for &#x27;Nolan&#x27; for this one of a kind Original movie. I don&#x27;t want
to say anything on story or cast related performances because
everything is just PERFECT. <br /><br />Just BE-AWARE of what you Dream. Is it possible?. Nolan has made it
look easy &#x26; presented it with brilliance.<br /><br />I just watched once and eager to watch it again and again since every
scene is so well made and the first half itself is so well executed
that once the second half starts, its a complete showdown till the end. <br /><br />A ride to remember.<br /><br />Classic for generations to come.
