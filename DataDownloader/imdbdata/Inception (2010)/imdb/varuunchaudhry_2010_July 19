Just when u think that Chris. Nolan cant come up with a movie of the
same league as the dark knight, he comes up with inception. 148 mins of
pure genius. an instant classic. it is well on its way to be the movie
of the decade or maybe even more. <br /><br />From start to finish this movie just holds your attention and you
witness something that u cant even dream of.Every single thing in the
movie seems to be picture perfect, each and every character has been
well portrayed and justified in its own way.<br /><br />The only problem i had was that i didn&#x27;t want the movie to get over, i
just wanted to be a part of his dream world. to conclude i would just
say that Chris Nolan is on his way to be recognized as one of the very
best the world has ever seen.
