I personally thought that inception was one of the most genius,
creative and amazing movies of all time, this is one of Christopher
Nolan,s master piece, the movie is so complicated, I thought that was
the beauty of it, it was pure imagination and creation, of all the
dreams the snow forest and the hotel, their was amazing shots, and the
music was energizing, at the end of the film when cob and Ariadne go
into the last dream, and you sea those buildings falling a t the sea
shore, the music at that moment was thrilling, one of Hans Zimmers best
pieces hes an amazing composer for the dark knight and this film. In my
opinion this is my favorite film, I have never seen such an amazing
movie with this idea, going into people&#x27;s dreams and planting ideas to
change their mind about a decision they made, its just pure
imagination, and genius, Christopher Nolan you are my hero.
