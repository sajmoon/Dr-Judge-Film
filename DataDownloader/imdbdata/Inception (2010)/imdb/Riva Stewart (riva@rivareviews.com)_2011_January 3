Following Leonardo DiCaprio as Cobb and his team (including scene
stealing Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Arthur) through a multilayered
dreamscape is a thrill for the mind and the eye. Starring in this bond
meets the matrix adventure along with Leonardo and Joseph is Ellen
Page, Tom Hardy and Ken Watanbe. Inception is written and directed by
Chris Nolan, director of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.<br /><br />The story follows a team of what I would call dream spies. It begins as
they are attempting to extract information from the subconscious of a
target, Saito (Ken Watanbe). But things don&#x27;t go quite as planned, the
target is more aware of the team&#x27;s special skills than they realize.
The dreamscape crumbles around them and the participants awaken, minus
a team member.<br /><br />Saito (still possessing the unknown information) propositions the team
to stretch their abilities and go beyond extracting information to
planting information in the subconscious. Can this be done; can a
thought introduced by another be accepted as one&#x27;s own? Needing a new
team, Cobb and Arthur must recruit the skills of a talented college
student, Ariadne (Ellen Page) and an experienced forger, Eames (Tom
Hardy) to attempt the task. Together they embark on a journey that will
take them not only into the deepest recesses of the new target&#x27;s mind
but their own as well.<br /><br />The look of the dream world is real yet pliable to the workings of a
dream architect. This is where the special effects add depth to an
interesting story. The idea of manipulating space and time is exciting.
It&#x27;s like being able to take a painter&#x27;s brush to the world. The
effects make you believe you are exactly where the characters say you
are. If Arthur tells you that it takes 3 minutes for something to fall,
in the dreamscape time slows enough to watch each nano second pass.<br /><br />Inception is a mind bending ride full of twist, turns, ups and downs. I
enjoyed every minute of it.<br /><br />www.rivareviews.com
