In my opinion this movie is the best Christopher Nolan has directed -
This movie is better than The Dark Knight in my opinion.I didn&#x27;t think
that any movie that Nolan would direct after The Dark Knight would get
any better but it outshone it by 20 times.When I went to see this movie
I definitely wasn&#x27;t disappointed with it.Nolan is one of the best
directors ever. I do believe without a doubt this is Nolan&#x27;s
masterpiece and any future movie from Nolan will be very difficult to
do better than this one.It reminded me of the Matrix but much better
with a mix of James Bond.It is very hard to understand unless you pay
very close attention to the movie(It is very hard to describe what this
movie is about), the plot was very good and had a very good
concept,Leonardo DiCaprio had an amazing performance which is very
worthy of Best Actor Academy Award and everyone else in the movie did
almost as well.The soundtrack in the movie was breathtaking.It kept me
on the edge of my seat wondering what is going to happen next.It was
interesting and imaginative.<br /><br />The movie did very well in every part and has all the elements required
to earn Best Picture at the 2011 Academy Awards and other awards, I
think that not only is this the best movie of 2010 it is probably the
best movie of the 2010 decade.If you haven&#x27;t seen this movie yet you
MUST see it.It is well worth the money.<br /><br />10/10 is my rating
