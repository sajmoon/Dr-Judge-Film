&#x22;Inception&#x22; is what you get when a filmmaker knows how to merge style
with substance. Christopher Nolan has crafted a story (not an original
one, but that&#x27;s OK) that takes slightly abstract ideas and places it in
a reality you can almost grasp, and then tells it with little
complexity. It&#x27;s a movie for all the masses - and that&#x27;s where Nolan&#x27;s
genius comes in.<br /><br />He gives us characters, many of them in fact, and all performed
expertly by the stellar cast. The dreams all have their own
architecture which is visually stunning. And no it&#x27;s not redundant to
say again that he managed to merge style with substance.<br /><br />&#x22;Inception&#x22; is filled with special effects, action running all over the
place and loud dramatic scores. Remember this is Nolan with a big
budget. But it&#x27;s also just a straight-forward story with characters and
romance - it does star Leonardo DiCaprio after all.
