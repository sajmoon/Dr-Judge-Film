2010_October 2 
Let me begin by saying that I have absolutely enjoyed everything
DiCaprio has done since 2002 and that I immensely enjoyed Nolan&#x27;s works
in the past.<br /><br />And let me admit that Nolan did a great job to bring this complex idea
to screen. However, the biggest problem with this movie was that you
could have cared less for what happened to its characters. &#x22;Inception
borrows heavily from &#x27;The Matrix&#x27;, a much better film in entertainment
terms, though Neo and the others were a lot easier to care for than
this bunch.&#x22;<br /><br />Let&#x27;s starts by DiCaprio&#x27;s wife who was absolutely annoying and her
story was getting repetitive as hell. It seems like Nolan enjoys
casting annoying actresses for main roles as he did with Gyllenhaal and
Katie Holmes in Batman. &#x22;How many times did they have to rehash the
pain of DiCaprio and his wife....his wife that didn&#x27;t even exist! Fine
he had issues but seriously, there is a limit to how much of it we have
to watch over and over...WE GET IT, he&#x27;s racked with guilt and misses
her!&#x22; <br /><br />DiCaprio and his gang, well I couldn&#x27;t care less for them either.
During the whole movie there was no good guy whom I cheered for or
whose cause I cared for and no bad guy who I hated, or somewhat admired
(such as Joker in Dark Knight). &#x22;The characters don&#x27;t have a lasting
effect on me at all and just seem like a means to an end. You know what
might help? How about writing dialogue that elicits more than one or
two laughs from the audience during the entire course of the film? I
don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen a director take himself so seriously.&#x22; <br /><br />&#x22;And then there is the dialogue. Oh my god.....I have never seen
anything trying to be so overly intense. I mean, a character could have
said &#x22;I feel like a sandwich for lunch&#x22; and there would have been
ominous music and dark glares. <br /><br />I am convinced there are tonnes of people that are afraid to give
negative reviews for fear of being labelled &#x22;stupid&#x22;. It shoved &#x22;I am
an intelligent movie&#x22; down your throat while the plot was simply &#x22;a
cool technology exists that allows us to share dreams, so now we must
use it to plant an idea in some trust fund baby&#x27;s head&#x22;. The movie was
unpredictable because it was simply the writer&#x27;s creativity and had no
boundaries. The story wasn&#x27;t responsible for ...well...anything (except
for drawing things out at a snails pace).&#x22; <br /><br />Then comes the last scene, where I just felt like this is just a
terrible movie, but to second guess myself by saying, maybe it is great
and I&#x27;m missing something. I mean bunch of people, all dressed the
same, running in the snow and shooting endlessly at each other,
creating no excitement, and the audience has no clue of the progression
that the good guys are making. And at points you forget what the hell
they are doing there. Not to mention how ridiculous it gets as non of
the bad guys seems to be able to hit a target as big a barn door. The
whole scene looked like a bad James Bond movie. The movie had me
looking for something cool or even vaguely interesting and every time I
started to get my hopes up it just kinda droned on then trailed off. <br /><br />Regardless, I just want to point out that, hey, it&#x27;s okay to just like
&#x27;Inception&#x27; without having to pick a side that says it&#x27;s a masterpiece
or a side that thinks it&#x27;s complete rubbish. &#x27;Inception&#x27; isn&#x27;t a movie
that will &#x22;change how movies are made.&#x22; It&#x27;s just a well done movie
that creates the illusion that it&#x27;s the thinking person&#x27;s movie that
never gives the viewer a chance to think. It&#x27;s a mass marketed
intellect. It&#x27;s like a KFC Double Down that&#x27;s sprinkled with truffles.
But, hey, I am part of the masses and, you know what, sometimes maybe I
do want to eat a fancy KFC Double Down. Which is why I liked
&#x27;Inception,&#x27; but why I also think it&#x27;s still just a KFC Double Down.<br /><br />The movie was fine in many aspects, although it had massive loop holes,
and is perhaps worth the watch, and I don&#x27;t like using the word
&#x22;overrated,&#x22; but it&#x27;s nothing close to what Dark Knight was.
