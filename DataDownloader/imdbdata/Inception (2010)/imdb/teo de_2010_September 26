I was disappointed. I had great expectations from the film and I was
let down. The story was predictable, nothing was left on viewer&#x27;s
imagination, the constant talking and explanation(in any single
scene)was unnecessary. The techniques of direction were pioneering, but
the story lacking of depth. The development of the character&#x27;s
personality was short, as a result the lack of connection between the
movie&#x27;s characters and the viewers. I expected more silent scenes and
less gunfire. Nollan, this time, was arrogant,underestimating the
viewer&#x27;s mind. The move was like a &#x22;blockbusterous&#x22; imitation of
memento. It was nothing new.<br /><br />I found myself sleeping after the break. When the movie ended &#x22;I was
old and regarded&#x22;.
