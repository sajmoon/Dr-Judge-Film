During the night the brain rages on, projecting dream worlds for the
sleeper, dream worlds that purge the mind from random luggage, often
combining bits and bytes that normally should not be connected at all.
In a dream anything is possible. And in this film, the dream stage is
the point where a mind can be altered, to give information the person
isn&#x27;t ready to give.<br /><br />Allowing the film this starting point makes for an interesting set-up -
a master thief enters dreams and tries to steal information from the
invaded sleeper. But than said thief is sent on another mission. He&#x27;s
not to steal anything, but he&#x27;s to leave something behind, he&#x27;s the
plant an idea that will eventually alter the decisions the person is
going to make.<br /><br />What follows is a nearly 2.5 hour long revolving tale in which a crime
is worked out. The visualization leans heavily on CGI, but doesn&#x27;t
abuse it - the essence of the film is in its story. It moves with
considerable speed but never looses track of itself and if there&#x27;s plot
holes in it they aren&#x27;t deep enough to trip over. So, all in all, good
stuff.<br /><br />9 out of 10 warped minds
