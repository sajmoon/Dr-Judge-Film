Inception with a extra-ordinary imaginations that you can&#x27;t even
imagine. likewise the going into a dream was brilliant thought by
Nolan. DiCaprio is always a spectacular actor on his own way. The film
though was unbelievable let us through a world of thriller which given
a kick always. The idea of going into dream and let know about the
ideas of others was which wont work out in real. Anyways the casts all
spelled the way of their acts. the most thrilled time was when Ariadne
went to the basement in the elevator which gives a limbo of surprise.<br /><br />But the suspiciousness of Fischer was toped the film. The train in the
downtown Los Angeles was a brilliant move by the director. Another
thing in this movie i could hardly notice was the casts never over
reacted for their play. I could possibly see in all the movies at least
one cast will over react, in that way movie gets a 10.<br /><br />Sad thing was the film didn&#x27;t won any academy or the Bafta
&#x22;disappointed&#x22;. The Fischer was followed with most anticipating
thriller but finally gives us a failure. Finally Cobb enters into his
homeland without any charges which is again easily predicted. Ariadne
was too young to enter the Inception instead she proved her maturity.
More like MATRIX which doesn&#x27;t uses heavy machines spaceships or
anything. The film rocked with its economical way and hit the spot most
high.<br /><br />I personally enjoyed the film which was i dreaming about.<br /><br />Inception &#x22;Dreamers choice&#x22;.
