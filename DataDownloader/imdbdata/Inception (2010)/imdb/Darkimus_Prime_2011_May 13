Inception. Arguably one of the best and highest rated films of 2010.
Starring Leonardo Di Caprio, Ellen Page(of Juno fame) and guest
starring Cillian Murphy ( Batman begins) amongst others, and directed
and written by Christopher &#x22;Dark Knight&#x22; Nolan, Inception had many high
expectations.<br /><br />Having seen the film twice I managed to grasp the concept a lot easier
second time round( although it has to be said the plot is not as
complicated as many people would have make out). Dream within a dream
within a dream within a dream. <br /><br />Coupled with the superbly interesting and original concept is the
superbly written script and the mind blowing SFX ( which makes Avatar
look tame at best) and the great acting from Di Caprio, Gordon-Levitt
and many of the supporting cast. I wasn&#x27;t as keen on Ellen Page, she
wasn&#x27;t bad I just wasn&#x27;t as keen on her as the other cast.<br /><br />With a great guest star performance from Michael Caine and a superb
plot twist which I defy anyone to say they saw coming, I can only hope
that this is the start of something new for films. A film that doesn&#x27;t
talk down to the audience, a film that requires a little bit of thought
on the viewers part.<br /><br />Overall a superb film with few flaws I can mention with an ending which
will leave the viewer gasping for more and sparking millions of debates
all over the internet.<br /><br />Having said this, I know how Hollywood has a record for ruining great
films with naff sequels, so from me to you Mr Nolan, keep this as a one
off. If it ain&#x27;t broken don&#x27;t fix it!<br /><br />My overall Rating 10/10
