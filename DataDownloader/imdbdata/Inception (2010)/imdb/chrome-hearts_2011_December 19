Inception was the movie of the summer &#x96; and many would probably say,
still the movie of the now. It resembles one of those things that
remains baffling, remains intriguing, and will probably remain, for a
long while, a long-talked-about cinematic masterpiece.<br /><br />Now, I don&#x27;t want this review to be another one of those that simply
commend director Christopher Nolan on everything he did right for
Inception, but I assure you that commending will happen. As this review
comes rather late considering the release date of July 16, 2010, my
viewpoint therefore comes from multiple sources &#x96; the theater, the DVD,
the reviews, everything.<br /><br />Inception follows the dilemma of Dom Cobb, played by Leonardo DiCaprio,
a thief who &#x22;specializes in a very specific type of security&#x22; -
subconscious security, which is in fact only a ploy. Cobb is a thief
who possesses the ability to enter his target&#x27;s subconscious&#x27;s dreams
and steal their innermost secrets &#x96; a technique called extraction.
After failing an attempt to steal his latest target&#x27;s (Ken Watanabe)
ideas, he is forced to risk himself and his team by performing an
extremely dangerous technique &#x96; inception &#x96; which involves planting an
idea inside a person&#x27;s head instead of stealing one.<br /><br />DiCaprio grabs you with his acting, going so far as to convince you
that his character is genuine and his concerns are real- there&#x27;s a
particularly heartbreaking scene towards the middle of the film where
the audience can almost feel themselves yelling inside just as much as
he is. As far as skill goes, people have come to expect nothing less
from DiCaprio, who is a supremely talented actor, although he&#x27;s been
snubbed for an Oscar many times now. As for the other actors, everyone
pretty much brings their A-game to the set- Joseph Gordon-Levitt is
slim and slick as Arthur, a team member who gathers information on the
targets, and Marion Cotillard is alluring and mysterious as DiCaprio&#x27;s
lost love. Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, and Ken Watanabe are just a few of
the other acting treats in the film.<br /><br />Inception&#x27;s plot is one of those things that can&#x27;t be justified through
a few simple paragraphs, however. A bare-boned plot summary like the
one above probably doesn&#x27;t do much to clear up the confusion. The
concept of infiltrating dreams is about as complex as you can get, but
leave it to director Christopher Nolan to concoct a story so immersive
that the only way to understand is to watch the film itself. As
producer, director, and screenwriter of the mind-bending thriller,
Inception reeks of the Nolan touch that made pieces like Memento and
The Dark Knight so intriguing. His ambition is quite staggering, and
the multi-layered structure of Inception places the audience in Nolan&#x27;s
clever hands.Yet, for some, such a storyline can trigger impatience and
confusion in those who don&#x27;t appreciate the finer points of filmmaking.
Even Ellen Page&#x27;s character, Ariadne, openly expresses her confusion in
the movie, going so far as to ask &#x22;Whose dream are we infiltrating,
again?&#x22; The movie takes some thinking to sink in, and some may call it
quits out of frustration.<br /><br />Although the complicated dream sequences and spinning tops and
chemistry might be a little hard on the brain, Inception is pretty damn
dazzling to the eyes, infusing within its story visuals so intense and
mind-boggling that the technical aspects of the film make up literally
half of the gorgeousness of the entire thing. Buildings folding upon
themselves, mirrors shattering, structures crumbling; a rotating
hallway, a van falling in slow motion, endless staircases- the visual
effects of Inception are so successful at impressing, The Oscar for
Visual Effects went to it without competition. Not to mention Hans
Zimmer&#x27;s moody, chill-inducing score, along with Zack Hemsey&#x27;s
impressively-talked-about track for the trailer. Inception&#x27;s visual and
audio aspects convey to the viewer the sheer power of the setting, the
seriousness of the events happening on screen, the sincerity of the
characters&#x27; emotions. Rolled into one, the film is one to remember- as
long as you can keep up with a labryinth of a plot and DiCaprio&#x27;s
brooding visage, Nolan has created a masterpiece- remember when
everyone was so puzzled the first time they saw the trailer? Well, the
film just spills piece after dazzling piece onto the table- and they&#x27;ll
be talked about for a long, long time to come.
