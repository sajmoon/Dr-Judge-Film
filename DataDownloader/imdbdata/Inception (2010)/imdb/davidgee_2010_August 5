Is it just me, or was this unintelligible? Not just &#x27;hacking&#x27; into
someone&#x27;s dreams but manipulating their thoughts inside Dreamworld. And
then, to add to the confusion, we had dreams within dreams within
dreams! If the complex plot had an internal logic which appeared not to
defeat Leonardo DiCaprio - it certainly defeated me. There is
considerable homage to the MATRIX films, with aerial fights and frozen
motion sequences: kid&#x27;s stuff, but what do kids make of the anarchic
storyline? <br /><br />If you die in someone else&#x27;s dream, you can either wake up alive or go
to a place called Limbo (not the same as the one Dante envisaged) which
looked like the flooded New York of The Day After Tomorrow a few
decades on. The plus side of Limbo for Leo was that it reunited him
with his dead wife (Marion Cotillard), but was this his limbo or hers?
Best not to ask.<br /><br />If MEMENTO, with time running backwards, was Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &#x22;set
text&#x22; for Filmgoing GCSE, I guess INCEPTION represents A-Level movie
comprehension.<br /><br />And I seem to have failed.
