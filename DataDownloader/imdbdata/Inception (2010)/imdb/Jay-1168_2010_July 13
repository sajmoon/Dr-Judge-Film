Inception is the Smartest film of the Year<br /><br />INCEPTION (PG-13) Directed by Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins and The
Dark Knight) Inception is the smartest film you will see all year. It
never plays down to the audience, in fact, it assumes the audience is
intelligent. Inception tells the story of Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio)
as a thief with the rare ability to enter people&#x27;s dreams and steal
their secrets from their subconscious. His skill has made him a hot
commodity in the world of corporate espionage but has also cost him
everything he loves. Cobb gets a chance at redemption when he is
offered a seemingly impossible task: Plant an idea in someone&#x27;s mind.
If he succeeds, it will be the perfect crime, but a dangerous enemy
anticipates Cobb&#x27;s every move.<br /><br />This movie is challenging, but always in a fun and inventive way that
keeps you captivated. It is an updated 40&#x27;s crime drama with a
technological twist that just works. <br /><br />After the fight scene in the hallway, you will agree with me that
Christopher Nolan will no doubt take home a few Oscars this year. Sound
Design, Cinematography, best Original Screenplay, Director and Film
unless something monumental is released between now and then. <br /><br />One scene alone should get Nolan the Oscar, and that being the city
folding back on itself. <br /><br />Most films this year are like sitting down to a bowl of potato chips,
Inception is like sitting down to the juiciest thickest most filling
steak dinner you&#x27;ve had in years. Inception opens Friday July 16 5 out
of 5 Stars Jay Fox
