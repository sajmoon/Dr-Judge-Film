How this is number 13 in the list is beyond me. It wasn&#x27;t that I didn&#x27;t
get it, it was more that I did get it, but didn&#x27;t get what the big deal
was about. Going inside people&#x27;s dreams - big wow.<br /><br />The special effects were pretty clever, but that is no substitute for
quality plots or acting.<br /><br />That this has been voted an average 8.8 by your common sci-fi nerd
unfortunately undermines the best film site on the net, which is a
shame because the &#x27;top 250&#x27; is usually a good democratic film review.
That is except when it is hijacked by what is tantamount to troll
pressure group.
