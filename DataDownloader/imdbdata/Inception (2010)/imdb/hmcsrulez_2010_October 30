9.1 / 10 on IMDb? <br /><br />So ~91% of Earth&#x27;s population is asleep, these people like the film so
much, because it tells them of fantahstic possibilities of dream state.<br /><br />Well I don&#x27;t want to wake up anyone forcefully, espehcially since
propagation of the weird reality of the American Dream, but speaking
from an outsider&#x27;s observation-point: looking at all your bodies with
your eyes wide-open but frozen in deep-sleep<br /><br />You all are so vulnerable in your dream!<br /><br />Since your birth it has been continuous, stabilized by swallowing
Matrix-blue pills. Greatest drama is you will never wake up what
happens at the final moment may resemble an individual in coma whose
heart or brain stops.
