No doubt that Christopher Nolan had been thinking and implementing his
mysterious and genius thoughts in the script and plot of Inception.<br /><br />The viewers always expect something different from the writers,
producers and directors. Inception had been completely different and
mind-blowing experience for me, personally. <br /><br />But, I guarantee that most of the audience felt exactly like me. This
movie is a beautiful combination of Action, Mystery, Sci-Fi,
Romance...and much more. It&#x27;s really worth of Oscars. I personally love
to see best-picture award of 2010 for Inception.<br /><br />One thing I would like to share proudly that when I was watching
Inception in our multiplex, during the end, the movie received a
standing ovation from every single viewer present. <br /><br />Hope Mr.Nolan make more great movies like these and give all of us more
&#x22;OMG!&#x22; moments. I wish Inception much more Oscars!! <br /><br />Good Luck!!
