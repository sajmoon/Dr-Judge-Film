The idea is obviously scintillating and grand by its very nature -
traveling through someone&#x27;s mind, visualizing the world their mind
sees, extracting secrets, and even planting new thoughts. This sort of
canvass opens door to infinite possibilities and nothing is off the
table.<br /><br />However, if one did have this capability, you have to assume US
Government would get the wind of it and would be all over it. There are
tons of special psyche-ops projects as we speak. I don&#x27;t believe
individuals could just market that ability to corporations for their
benefits. If you are a head of some corporation now, how would you even
think this option exists, and how would you even approach it? There
should be a better explanation of how the talent and its employer found
each other and it should not be shown as something that occurs as
normally as one hiring a contractor to fix their house.<br /><br />The objective in this movie was so trivial - one corporation wants the
destruction of other.<br /><br />Bankers on wall street accomplish that 100 times a day, and they own
media too, not only to travel through one persons&#x27; mind, but mold mind
of entire population, as a matter of fact, entire humanity. So there
was nothing too exciting for me about the conception of &#x27;INCEPTION&#x27;
itself. People are doing it to entire populations, so what is so great
about doing it to just one person.<br /><br />To me it would have meant more and I would have cared more, if the
objective was as grand as the tool of inception. Something that impacts
entire humanity and not just head of one corporation.<br /><br />Also, the visions created by so called architect, are just lame. I
think you would find lot more titillating and morbid stuff in a healthy
male American brain, then just people walking around in suits. I have
had lots of dreams, and none of them ended with a plot of B-Action
movie. How does a teenage girl know what corporate world looks like?<br /><br />I do like the main idea of the movie, how it opens doors to reckless
imagination, even though it was barely tapped upon. I liked the acting
of different characters. Most importantly I liked the personal
suffering that the main character experienced, because he had this
power, and he misused it, so it is the law of Universe, he pays for it
in maximum. I however, don&#x27;t like the attempt to show relatively happy
ending for him. In epic battle of right and wrong, wrong can win all
the way, but NOT at the very end. Otherwise, there is no basis for
anything.<br /><br />Finally, the last trick to not let the audience know whether the
spinning top stops or not is just so cheap, that it should be ridiculed
by critics who know what they are talking about.
