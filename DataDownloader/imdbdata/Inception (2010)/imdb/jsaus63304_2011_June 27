Good news is I got to see it for free on an HBO free weekend and did
not have to pay to see it.<br /><br />Bad news, I got to see the movie.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to this movie. The trailers were great and
the concept was intriguing. The problem was the execution. Once again,
chase scenes, fights, explosions, special effects etc took the place of
good writing. What could have been a cerebral movie just turned out to
be another action movie. I do not want to take anything away from the
special effects, they were very good and some were outstanding. My
problem was that maybe there was only 30 minutes of actual plot and
dialog in the entire movie. After a while, you quit wondering if it is
real or a dream and just start dreaming that the movie will end soon.
There are really no good twists and turns in the movie and little that
is so thought provoking that you want to talk about the movie
afterwords.<br /><br />My advice would be to take the special effects budget and spend it on
some great writers.<br /><br />As the old commercial asked &#x22;Is it real or is it Memorex?&#x22; Who cares?
