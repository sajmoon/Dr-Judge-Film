Why did give this movie 10/10? Simply because of it&#x27;s originality, it&#x27;s
script and it&#x27;s direction. Inception is one of the great cinematic
works that you must experience for itself. You may have to see it twice
to fully grasp it&#x27;s complex plot, but you even have to solve the puzzle
for yourself to understand and appreciate a script that has taken nine
years to write. I only hope it gets the Oscar nominations it deserves.<br /><br />And it does deserve a hell of a lot of nominations. I predict it will
win best screenplay but other wins are likely. Leonardo Di Caprio was
the perfect actor in my opinion to play as the main character. He
brings mystery, intelligence and believable action to the plot. A must
see film!
