Di Caprio plays Cobb, an expert in extracting information from people&#x27;s
minds by infiltrating a target&#x27;s dream. In return for a new identity,
which will allow him again to go to the States to be with his kids,
Cobb is challenged to now plant an idea in someone&#x27;s mind in stead of
retrieving it.<br /><br />The premise of the film is rather silly but it&#x27;s the execution that
truly ruins the film. The major issue is without a doubt the exposition
ridden dialog which didn&#x27;t progress the overall plot or added anything
in terms of character development. In stead we get the most expensive
cast doing little else than yammer on and on about the totally
uninteresting and far-fetched technical methods that are involved in
dream infiltration as Nolan&#x27;s showcases his unimaginative and clueless
take on the Sci-Fi genre. In between these witless and thoroughly
boring expositions, we get treated to the action clich&#xE9;s from every
Bond movie that has ever graced the silver screen in the past 3 or 4
decades while the pounding soundtrack gets louder and louder simply
with every subsequent scene.<br /><br />Where was the conflict in this story needed to create viewer
involvement? Who exactly were we expected to root for? Why was
everything happening in this film without exception utterly
implausible? Why do people find this movie to be complex when the film
spends about 95% of the script explaining what is going on. And why
wasn&#x27;t this hapless script nominated for a couple of Razzies?<br /><br />The fans are right, I don&#x27;t get it.
