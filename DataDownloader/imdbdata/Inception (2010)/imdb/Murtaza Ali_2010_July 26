Surrealism can appear to be ineffably bizarre, or inquisitively
titillating, depending purely on the viewer&#x27;s intellect. Though the
realm of surrealism is highly nebulous and complex, but even a slight
attempt at improvisation can sometimes go awry and open a Pandora&#x27;s
Box, making the task highly improbable and nigh impossible. This facet
of reality may pose a handicap to the most gifted of the directors, but
not to the genius of Christopher Nolan, who not only dabbles with the
concept of surrealism, but also ingeniously blends it with the elements
of Science Fiction in his latest wonder named Inception. Nolan created
a niche for himself a decade back by unleashing a monster of a movie
called Memento. He further substantiated his status by conjuring movies
like Insomnia, The Prestige, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. His
unremitting desire for innovation and uncanny craving to foray into the
unexplored realms of imagination deservedly earned him an auteur tag,
which gave him the carte blanche that a story-teller like Nolan
desperately needs. It&#x27;s highly apparent that Nolan takes every possible
advantage of this liberty while filming Inception. Inception is not
only dreamlike, but is a dream in itself and is superior to any other
thing conceived on the silver screen. With its entwined layers, the
movie for the most part serves as an unfathomable riddle and makes
multiple viewing extremely essential. It incredibly does extremely well
on both the humanistic as well as the technical fronts. In fact, the
balance between human emotions and the elements of Science Fiction is
so adequate that it&#x27;s impossible to separate them. <br /><br />The movie is about a futuristic world where the human mind can be
intercepted through dream invasion. Cobb is an expert in the art of
extracting information (stealing valuable secrets) from deep within the
subconscious in the dream state. His proficiency in extraction is
marred by a turmoil that begins with his wife&#x27;s untimely death. He is
forced to live the life of a fugitive away from his children. His only
chance for redemption lies with a Japanese tycoon named Saitu, who
wants him to do an inception (planting information into someone&#x27;s
mind). In order to accomplish this unprecedented task, Cobb and his
team must overcome a labyrinth of unforeseeable challenges, where even
a slight miss could trap them in a perpetual limbo. Any further
revelation would be remissness on my part as the plot is filled with
such intricacies that even expatiation would be incapable of justifying
its profundity. <br /><br />Leonardo Dicaprio gives a solid performance in the lead role, following
his memorable performance in Shutter Island. He has brilliantly
depicted the complexities and limitations of Cobb&#x27;s enigmatic character
highlighting his pain and mental trauma. Marion Cotillard is
ravishingly scintillating as Cobb&#x27;s whimsical wife, Mal. The rest of
the cast has given a thorough performance with special mention of Ken
Watanabe, Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.<br /><br />Inception is incredibly brilliant as a movie and is a breakthrough in
contemporary cinema. Nolan&#x27;s creativity and his unparalleled execution
definitely make it an object of great cachet, but whether it would
become Bu&#xF1;uel&#x27;s &#x27;Un chien andalou&#x27; or Kubrick&#x27;s &#x27;2001: A Space Odyssey&#x27;
and serve as a prototype for the movies to come is for the time to
decide. Irrespectively, Inception is sine qua non not only for an
aficionado, but also for the average viewer, who is willing to delve
deep enough to savour the delight.<br /><br />PS: One has to imagine it to believe it. 9/10
