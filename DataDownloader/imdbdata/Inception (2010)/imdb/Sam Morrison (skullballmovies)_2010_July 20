What do our minds tell us when we see something we don&#x27;t want to see?
We wish they were dreams, just made up images caused by chemicals in
our brains. Dreams are extremely powerful, and this was displayed in
Inception with great force. It shows what can happen and what can&#x27;t
happen with our thoughts; things we want to see, things we don&#x27;t want
to see, and things we have to see. They also conjure up our imagination
more than anything in our lives can force to do. We create our own
little worlds and certain things happen in those worlds. All of this is
pretty much explained in the film and it keeps your interest extremely
well. All of the situations and different places and things that
happened throughout the movie really showed how powerful dreams and our
imaginations are. The performances didn&#x27;t par up with the great story
telling and production value but they were still great nonetheless. I
highly recommend this movie to anyone to wants to think deep and to be
taken into another world for 2 1/2 hours.
