On first impression &#x22;Inception&#x22; is a highly enthralling mental
experience that seems to defy logic and yet be so believable. But as
the saying goes ,the devil is in the details.Christopher Nolan uses his
signature style of film-making to create a multi-layered film. His
signature style is:confuse the audience.Just as in &#x22;Following(1998)&#x22;
which used out-of-sequence storyboard,this movie presented a complex
concept in the most complex fashion possible(just watch the snow
sequence where in dream level 3 where all characters have their faces
covered and who is doing what gets so confusing!).The characters say
some rules as the movie proceeds which is suppose to explain what is
going on around them.But there are pretty big faults and loopholes in
them-a detailed explanation is given below.<br /><br />Gravity rule 1: Gravity in next level dream = Gravity in previous level
dream.(This is highlighted when Yusuf(who was driving the van) is in
free fall.This results in a gravity free space at the hotel (in dream
level 2)This should according to the above rule result in a gravity
space in level 3 which is not the case.It is just like saying that A=B
&#x26; B=C but A is not equal to C which is logically impossible!!<br /><br />Gravity rule 2:Yusuf&#x27;s drug left inner ear function unimpaired and thus
if anyone having a sense of falling(sense of falling means feeling
weightless -basic physics) gets a jerk;he/she gets awakened.If this is
true then there was no need for Arthur to tie all others and shove them
down an elevator to create a sense of falling AS THEY WERE ALREADY IN
SENSE OF FREE FALL(being in a gravity free space).All he had to do was
give a jerk!!<br /><br />Rule 3:You can recall things from previous dreams.Cobb,Mal and Robert
Fischer remembered their dreams perfectly.Robert even recalled a number
sequence from previous dream level.Then why at the end did Robert not
remember that Cobb and the others were in his dream on waking up(he
glances at Cobb while waiting for luggage and ignores him)??<br /><br />Mister Nolan please make films more carefully next time.
