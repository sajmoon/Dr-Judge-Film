Reaping money like there&#x27;s no tomorrow and rocketing to the top of IMDb
to contend with even The Godfather and Shawshank, Inception has had
nothing but success since its release. An incredible sceptic toward all
things popular, especially in their earliest days, I fully expected
this to be quite poor and overrated.<br /><br />Working as an independent dream-thief, Dom Cobb is tasked with the more
difficult job of implanting a thought within the mind of a subject, the
promise of reunion with the family from which he is estranged his
motivation to do so. Forging a team of assorted talents, he plans an
intricate network of dreams and deceit whilst simultaneously coping
with increasingly realistic memories of the past.<br /><br />When a film garners almost universal acclaim and high rankings all
around, discussion turns quickly away from the work itself, and more
towards its accolades. Such is certainly the case with Inception, its
current spot at number 3 on the top 250 as much the subject of
discussion boards as the (soi-disant) intricacies of its plot. Like its
predecessor in Nolan&#x27;s filmography, The Dark Knight, Inception is now
praised variously as genius, brilliant, revolutionary, and &#x22;the
greatest film ever&#x22;. Yet almost for every fanboy who screams the
wonders of this sci-fi epic is a cynic, tutting with disapproval and
angrily muttering about the decline of modern civilisation. What we&#x27;re
currently seeing is a replay of Nolan&#x27;s fortunes just two years ago.
Some call him the new Kubrick, others dismiss him as a glorified
Michael Bay. The arguments between these two camps have been the
subject of more discussion than the film&#x27;s merits, or lack thereof;
indeed such is the content of this &#x22;review&#x22; so far. My point: people
feel compelled by such acclaim to either love the film, or to hate it,
leaving a disturbing imbalance in its ratings. Unless you take a stand
and proclaim it ludicrous garbage, anything other than unending praise
will see you labelled a thoughtless moron, incapable of artistic
appreciation or sagacious thought. Those who rate it a 1 out of 10 are
making a point, refusing to stand for overrating. The simple fact is
that Inception is a good film: entertaining; interesting; superb
looking; well-acted; well-directed. Is it a masterpiece? No, absolutely
not. Its flaws are many, both logically and cinematically; its moments
of brilliance few. Aside from excellent effects and anti-gravitational
fight sequences, it holds insufficient emotional impact to transcend
the general mediocrity of its genre: the heist thriller in essence. And
that is it. The film is perfectly entertaining, but at no stage is it
anything special. I enjoyed myself, but certainly see nothing within it
to warrant such vigorous fanaticism. And the ending was silly,
overused, and lazy.<br /><br />A key example of the way in which people forget what they really should
be discussing, Inception has become naturally presumed as a deep and
thoughtful movie, probing far into recondite things and leaving us to
formulate our own theories and opinions. In truth it is a standard
action film, delivering a solid chunk of appealing-to-the-eye
entertainment (some of the best for a while), but little more. Its plot
is complex rather than its meaning, a key mistake audiences will
continue to make as they argue and bicker. I just wish people could sit
back and enjoy the film, rather than messing their pants at every
halfway decent movie that hits the screen.
