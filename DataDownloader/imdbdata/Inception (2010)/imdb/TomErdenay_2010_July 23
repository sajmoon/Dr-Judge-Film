I&#x27;ll be frank - this has to be one of the best movies I&#x27;ve ever seen.<br /><br />The idea is original, the cast is great, the effects are amazing, the
plot is mind blowing and it leaves you with something to think about -
what more can you actually ask? It&#x27;s quite hard to talk about the movie
without actually revealing anything about it, but all you need to know
that all of the actors play in it extremely well, the plot has enough
twists and turn-arounds for you to be completely shackled at your seat
and that it will leave you with something to think about it.<br /><br />If you are having any doubts whether to go see it or not, don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s
definitely worth seeing and probably not just once.
