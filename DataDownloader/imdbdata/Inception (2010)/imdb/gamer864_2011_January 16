First the good news. The movie contains decent action sequences. The
acting is OK, some exceptions left aside.<br /><br />Apart from that, this movie is overrated.<br /><br />The characters are one-dimensional. The story is predictable. About
acting, Di Caprio can you make believe everything, except that this is
a good movie. The actors try to perform and get something out of the
script, but sometimes you can see them struggle and that can not be the
purpose.<br /><br />Score is about 9 at the moment of writing, that&#x27;s higher rated than all
movies of Hitchcock... Are you kidding me ?
