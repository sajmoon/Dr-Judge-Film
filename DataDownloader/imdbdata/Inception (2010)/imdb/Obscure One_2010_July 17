I am stingy when it comes to awarding 10 points for a movie, but in
this case I have no choice. Have seen quite a bit of movies over the
last 2 years, but none of them ever incited me to discuss it with my
friends, or even if they did, not the way inception is doing now.<br /><br />People rave about avatar, but other than the fancy graphics the
storyline was very bland. None of that&#x27;s going to happen with
inception. From the start right till the end, it will keep you
wondering as to what might come next. Makes you think as well. You
don&#x27;t have to be super smart to understand the movie. An average person
will surely absorb it pretty decently.<br /><br />Leo has been amazing as always. He&#x27;s a brilliant actor, probably the
best currently. Nolan and leo both deserve Oscars for what they have
achieved here. Levitt has been damn good. The last I saw of him was in
500 days of summer. Was pleasantly surprised to see him in a mature
role. Not sure about Ellen Page. Nothing in her role made me say &#x22;wow,
she&#x27;s damn good&#x22;. She was okay. Ken Watanabe was decent. Tom Hardy was
good. I liked the way he portrayed being a more serious/jovial kind of
person as opposed to how Levitt is, especially all.<br /><br />I am damn happy for watching the first-day-first-show for this movie.
Planning to go down and watch it again tomorrow. Worth every extra
penny i am spending on it :)
