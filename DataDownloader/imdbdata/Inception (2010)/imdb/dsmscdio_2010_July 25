When I went to see this movie I thought that the beginning seemed kind
of rushed and a little cheesy and thought &#x22;ok well maybe they&#x27;re just
setting up the rest of the movie&#x22; so I gave it a chance and the movie
delivered! The movie keeps you thinking about where in the film you are
and the action sequences are just plain awesome and fun! The soundtrack
is also perfect for what is happening. I was told that the less you
know about the movie the better it is, so this is how I went. I have
already seen it twice and it was just as good the second time around.
If you have any doubt don&#x27;t worry, just go see it, even if it somehow
didn&#x27;t live up to the hype that you may have heard you will still have
left with a great experience!
