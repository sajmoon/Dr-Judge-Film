For a film that deals in the world of dreams this film lacks a lot of
imagination. I think that in being a Hollywood blockbuster it had to
tick a certain amount of boxes that are necessary for the monumental
amounts of money that are thrown at it.<br /><br />The first 30 minutes I was interested by the concept and the pacing of
the film. The concept of espionage within a dream is an interesting
enough concept. I was very open and excited by the idea of going into
the world of dreams with the characters. I wish they could have perhaps
explored a little more and pushed the boundaries of the dreams. It
seemed that time and space flowed a little too seamlessly. Perhaps
Kafka&#x27;s &#x27;The Trial&#x27; or a more Cronenberg style would have helped.<br /><br />After the first 30 minutes it sunk into the normal plodding of a
Hollywood blockbuster. Are we watching Mission Impossible or a film
about dreams? Unfortunately the last two thirds of the film were more
Mission Impossible. I couldn&#x27;t help thinking of the could have beens.
All I remember is a van falling for two hours, some irrelevant action
scenes in the tundra, and an in-durable no gravity scene which had me
yawning.<br /><br />Oh and am I the only one who cannot stand Marion Coutillard?
