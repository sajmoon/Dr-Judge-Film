their toes and needs the complete attention from the viewer so that
nothing is missed. Although the film at times foreshadows what will
happen in the following scenes the viewer knows what will happened but
they do not know when it will happen. <br /><br />The writer had Artistic semblance of Truth by creating a world that
makes that the film is could be actually true with the unique special
effects. This film makes the viewer feel that this could really happen
with the advancement of technology. <br /><br />Cinematography is rather unique with background motion while the lens
still focuses on the character gives the film a special touch that
really isn&#x27;t seen. The camera man uses a lot of close up shots to make
the viewer see that they need listen to the character. Also there are a
lot of Telephoto Lenses shots that make two different shots closer than
they are and a lot of wide angle views also. Some slow-motion shots
give the film a nice look shits that are more familiar from the movie
the Matrix. This film is great with the visual effects such as great
CGI shots that makes the film stand out from other films. <br /><br />The cast is great not to many names that jump out and catch but names
and faces that the audience are already familiar with.<br /><br />Inception is a all around excellent movie with more than exceptional
special effects and unique uses of the camera, with many various
techniques that are used throughout the film. This movie could be a
cinematographer dream. This movie gives Leonardo DiCaprio another notch
under his belt with great movies and great acting.
