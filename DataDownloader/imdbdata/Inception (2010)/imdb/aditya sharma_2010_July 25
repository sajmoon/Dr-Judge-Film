When i first read about the movie, i was not too sure of what to
expect. Sure it had Leonardo DiCaprio starring, but at that time i was
not even aware of who was directing this wonderful masterpiece. So with
little expectations i went to watch the movie at 11 at night. That was
the last time i think i would want to watch another Movie. Inception is
something which i am still having a hard time describing even after
having seen it two times. Its not just a movie i guess. Its something
which could only be conceived once in a life time. I have seen a lot of
movies. And i can guarantee that i have not seen anything like this. I
even joined IMDb just to rate this movie 10 and now i am writing this
review. Why?..How?.. There are so many questions i have in my mind
right now, and this is not from my misunderstanding of the movie. But
they are just random thoughts which fail to escape me. I don&#x27;t want to
see anything else now. I don&#x27;t want to breathe anything else now.
Sitting in the theater for those 2.5 hours have changed the way i look
at things. An idea is like a virus...This movie is a classic. I would
pay you to go watch it. The music i am listening to right now is from
the movie, its reminding me of my experience and i wish to take it with
me always.
