After seeing the cast, I couldn&#x27;t wait to see this movie. I completely
over-hyped myself. Who wouldn&#x27;t though? My two favorite young actors of
Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cilian Murphy, Marion Cotillard,
Michael Caine, Leo, etc. The icing on the cake was it was directed by
Christopher Nolan who doesn&#x27;t understand how to make a bad movie. After
one and a half years of waiting, I finally caught a midnight showing. I
decided to write this review three days later.<br /><br />We know the basic plot. Leo and crew attempt to steal from people&#x27;s
dreams, etc.<br /><br />This movie was incredible. It exceeded my expectations which were as
high as possible to begin with. It starts up with action in the very
first five minutes and never really lets up. The portrayal of dreams
was spot on even if they were lucid dreams. Such an example, Leo runs
out of a room and ends up in another that looked completely different
with some different characters from before. The further we get through
the movie, the more controlled the dreams were until someone from Leo&#x27;s
pass gets in the way.<br /><br />The film is very multilayered. I don&#x27;t want to give much a way but it
is very hard to follow. If you notice a lot of the critics who didn&#x27;t
care for the movie, you&#x27;ll notice that the theme of their review hinted
that they couldn&#x27;t really absorb most of the information processed
throughout the film. I still haven&#x27;t fully grasped everything in the
movie but that&#x27;s what I love about it. I plan seeing this movie at
least four more times so I have a decent interpretation of everything.
That and the special effects are still worth every price of the ticket
alone.<br /><br />For first time viewers, pay close attention to Ellen Page&#x27;s character,
Ariadne (I think Nolan is tired of traditional names). She explains a
lot of key information throughout the movie. The cast was very good. I
think Cilian Murphy really stood out the most to me.<br /><br />Inception reminded me of Jean-Pierre Melville films which involve a
long heist sequence. This movie is almost one long heist. Of course the
matrix and eternal sunshine come to mind but in no way does this film
rip them off. Inception is guaranteed to stay with you for a long time
and most likely blow your mind. The two and a half hours flew by. I
didn&#x27;t want this movie to end.<br /><br />Inception is a masterpiece. Taking eight years to write a movie pays
off.
