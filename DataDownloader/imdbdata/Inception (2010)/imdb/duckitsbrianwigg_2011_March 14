This is one smart and entertaining movie right here. The type that
makes you want to watch it a couple times for you to completely
comprehend and appreciate it&#x27;s genius. All of your attention is needed
for this one. And Leonardo Dicaprio definitely continues to chose smart
original suspense titles that don&#x27;t disappoint. I can always trust his
character to be intelligent also. A must see movie for anybody, except
maybe kids. The movie is awesome in BLUE RAY, but I&#x27;m sure will still
be very enjoyable in normal DVD format, due to the fact that the
storyline is excellently crafted, with little need for crazy action
scenes, even if there are some. And the best thing about this movie in
my opinion, is, it&#x27;s an original. So many movies are remakes, and
that&#x27;s fine sometimes, but to watch an original, a movie that you don&#x27;t
necessarily know the story and how it ends and whatnot, makes for a
more suspenseful movie.
