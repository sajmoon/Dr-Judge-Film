All I can say is the writers, director and cast must have had a *LOT*
of fun with Inception. Some of the creativity was really out there and
just so much fun to enjoy.<br /><br />Very few movies are worth a 10 or even an 8 or a 9 (in my book). But
Inception was easily worth a 10, it was fantastic! So many movies waste
time with filler stuff that has little or no bearing on the movie.
Inception didn&#x27;t waste a single minute, needing every one of it&#x27;s
carefully crafted 148 minutes.<br /><br />Inception started off a little slower as it needed to build its back
story. Basically a little better than an average movie to start, but
not an overwhelming beginning. But as it went on the pace picked up and
the movie slowly built to a fantastic and fast paced crescendo.<br /><br />I&#x27;m not normally a DiCaprio fan, but he, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen
Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe and the others all helped make up a great
all star cast.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to see Inception in the theater and I&#x27;m so glad I
did. I&#x27;d have hated to have had any &#x22;home&#x22; interruptions or
distractions while I was watching it. A job well done to everyone
involved!
