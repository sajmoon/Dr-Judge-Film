This is the &#x27;most brilliant&#x27; film i have truly ever seen! To me,it was
even better than Christopher Nolan&#x27;s previous masterpiece &#x27;The Dark
Knight&#x27;! But undoubtedly &#x27;Inception&#x27; is the masterpiece of his
masterpieces! I don&#x27;t want to discuss anything about the storyline
because if you are reading this,then you must have already read the
unique and very compelling storyline.All the actors were absolutely
fantastic in their individual roles,especially of course Leonardo
DiCaprio.The sound editing and mixing,music,art,dress-up,visual
effects,film editing and all the other elements were excellent! This is
the first movie i am ever commenting about on IMDb so you must
understand how moved i am by it.While watching,i was totally glued to
the screen during the whole movie and in the last one hour of it,i
probably didn&#x27;t even want to blink! Plus after watching Inception,i
have been researching and experimenting so much about dreams! Till
now,i have watched it several times and each time it felt wonderful.
Overall,this is a &#x27;must watch&#x27; film and i would definitely give it a
10/10.In my opinion,it should have won Oscars for both &#x27;Best Film&#x27; and
&#x27;Best Director&#x27;!
