I really don&#x27;t want to talk at all about the plot or the characters too
much, as it&#x27;s impossible not to give something away. It&#x27;s really best
if you go into this movie knowing what the trailers tell, and that&#x27;s
it. The performances are absolutely superb. The acting is simply
wonderful, Page and DiCaprio steal the show. You must go into this
movie on a full stomach with your thinking cap on though. I do not
advise eating or drinking during the film as one bathroom break will
wreck the whole experience for you. The film making here is absolutely
top-notch. The special effects are tastefully rendered and do not take
away from the film at all. 10/10 from this movie-goer. I&#x27;ve yet to find
a significant flaw that could motivate me enough to drop it to 9.
