i saw this movie yesterday.it was mind blowing.i went with some great
expectations and this movie surpassed my expectations.the screenplay
was awesome and the cast was excellent.some brilliant performances by
actors like Dicaprio,levitt and Ellen page had made this movie a 2011
Oscar contender.the first half of the movie was a bit slow but the
second half gained pace and was mind blowing.Nolan deserves Oscar for
creating this masterpiece.am sure that this movie will be the no.1
contender for 2011 Oscars..hope this movie gets many Oscars. thanks to
Nolan for giving this wonderful movie.. i give this movie a
10/10...nolan u rock.........
