Inception is just too hard to believe to be made in real life. This
movie takes the aspects of dreams and turned it from illusion to
fantasy reality. This movie is a smart movie that is gonna be hard to
beat for years to come.<br /><br />Leonardo Di Caprio was already a good actor, but inception turned his
acting from good to phenomenal. They have an unusually unknown cast,
besides Leonardo of course, but they all pulled the movie together
perfectly with all of their parts.<br /><br />My mom watched this whole movie, and i thought that she would like it,
but she thought it was stupid. She likes movies that are filled with
drama, and some action if it has a great story. I thought she would
like this movie because it was so brilliantly put together, but she did
not.<br /><br />I, on the other hand, got it for Christmas that month it came out,
watched it that day, and I loved it. I love dreams; they amaze me with
how fast time reacts in and out of dreams and life. This movie is one
of the best I have seen in quite sometime, and I definitely would
recommend it to anyone just because of how great the storyline is.
