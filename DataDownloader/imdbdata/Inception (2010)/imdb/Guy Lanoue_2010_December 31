This overly-hyped movie tried to be too clever by half and didn&#x27;t even
manage to pull off a Matrix-type pretentiousness. It&#x27;s just bad,
substituting elementary (and wrong) psychobabble for plot. It&#x27;s science
fiction and fantasy, it doesn&#x27;t have to conform to real life but it
should conform to its own rules. The acting was wooden, which is due to
the bad script because each of these actors can hold their own
elsewhere. The pacing is glacial. We are continually being preached at
about the subconscious, but it&#x27;s all like an Agatha Christie novel,
with a surprise, unforeseen and unannounced deus ex machina just
popping up here and there to wrap things up. Like, it&#x27;s really
complicated because there are these things called &#x22;levels&#x22; to dreaming
and the subconscious. If the director spent ten years writing this
script, he should get another job. It looks like it was pasted together
in a couple of days over a few too many mai-tais. Some interesting
visuals, but that&#x27;s all there is.
