after i watched this movie i just had certain thoughts 1.how the hell
did Nolan wrote such a great complicated script. 2.how did he assemble
such a great intelligent cast &#x26; crew,that was able 2 understand &#x26;
perform in this amazingly high level. 3.how did he saw &#x26; shoot the film
in this mind blowing way. 4.how can u create a movie that people will
sit &#x26; watch without being able 2 just rest their minds even 4 seconds.
5.Nolan will go among the greatest directors this film making business
have ever seen. 6.DiCaprio deserves an Oscar 4 this.(and also 4 SHUTTER
ISLAND).<br /><br />THIS MOVIE IS A RIDE,JUST BUCKLE ON BEFORE U TAKE IT..IT&#x27;S A MIND
BLOWING RIDE..IT&#x27;S A RIDE THAT WILL TAKE U 2 PLACES THAT U NEVER
WENT..U WILL FEEL THAT THIS A MASTERPIECE ALL THE WAY.. NOLAN THANK
YOU.....
