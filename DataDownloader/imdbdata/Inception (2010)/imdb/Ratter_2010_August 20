How does one go about reviewing a film like Inception without giving
anything away? Ideally you can&#x27;t but no matter how much you know, or
think you know, nothing can prepare you for what you are about to
experience. That being said the less you know, the more rewarding it
can be.<br /><br />Inception is one of the very few exceptions to the summer Blockbuster
where the intelligence of it ranks as high as the action. Sure, you
won&#x27;t have you&#x27;re life changed by it, but you&#x27;ll certainly have
something to talk about afterwards. Like many of his previous films,
Inception can be understood on a single viewing, but to understand the
real motivation behind it and see between all the layers does mean
extra viewings.<br /><br />I know that many people have criticised the film claiming it wants to
make you feel dumb or that it want to be complex, however that is not
the case. The film is relatively linear in narrative, with only a few
flashbacks scenes that act as necessary exposition on DiCaprio&#x27;s
character. I will say though that the film can become complicated, not
because it wants to be but because it has to be. The idea behind the
multiple levels of dreaming can be hard to understand at first, but
this doesn&#x27;t necessarily deter you from the actual film. Other than
this, by simply paying attention the film should remain simple on the
surface and allow you to enjoy it without feeling lost. It&#x27;s only if
you scratch deeper that you unleash Nolan&#x27;s true power of narrative and
you realise how intricate each part of the film is and how vital its
role is.<br /><br />The acting itself is exceptional with no one pulling you out of the
experience. DiCaprio gives his best, and it shows. Gordon-Levitt is
brilliant and is responsible for the film&#x27;s most memorable set-piece.
Hardy&#x27;s Eames adds some of the blink-and-you&#x27;ll-miss-them witty remarks
that provide some mild comic relief. The dialogue itself works well in
the film and it&#x27;s obvious that care was taken when the scripting was
done.<br /><br />In turns of visually, Inception seems to hit every mark. The
cinematography is stunningly gorgeous, no matter what the situation is
and the use of IMAX cameras gives the impression that Nolan really
wants us to see the bigger picture, which we do. The special effects
are nothing short of mind-blowing. Nolan, who isn&#x27;t keen on CGI,
obviously cares that what few scenes should feature it they have to be
flawless. The most eye-popping scene, and the one which will forever
stay with me, features Gordon-Levitt&#x27;s Arthur fighting it out in a
corridor while bouncing all over the place. While this doesn&#x27;t sound
like much, in the context of the film it is a flawless piece of stunt
work that is just amazing to watch. Even knowing how it was done it is
still fascinating to watch the scene play out and marvel at how
authentic it feels.<br /><br />In short Inception is a movie that you have to see.
