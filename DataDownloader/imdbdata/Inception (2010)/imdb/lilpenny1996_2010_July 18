What a great movie! I went to see the movie yesterday without knowing a
lot about the movie other than the reviews and the confusing previews.
If it wasn&#x27;t for Dicaprio I probably wouldn&#x27;t have given this movie a
shot. The previews don&#x27;t do this movie justice. It was a brilliant
idea. A dream within a dream within a dream? The movie starts off kind
of slow but really picks up and doesn&#x27;t look back from there. Paying
attention in the beginning is crucial to understanding the plot. The
acting, the directing, the special effects were all great. DiCaprio is
the GOAT. Inception is easily the best movie of the year. Worth the
price of admission.
