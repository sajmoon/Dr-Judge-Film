The only reason I had not to stand up and leave was Joseph
Gordon-Levitt, because my boots are made for walking. But his part,
unfortunately, is neither long nor developed. Lukas Haas disappears in
the beginning, which is also a waste of talent. Instead, we see
Leonardo DiCaprio, just as he always is : not bad, not good. Ellen
Page, here an actress in limbo. Cilian Murphy, in a character also
unexploited. And Marion Cotillard in repeated appearances : love,
murder, suicide. All the actors seem to think: &#x22;dont&#x27;t be harsh, I know
I am acting in a silly movie; I just do my best not to show.&#x22; Alas!
their idea of a nightmare goes to our consciousness (without stealing),
and stays. The directing is nonexistent.<br /><br />Too bad, I did not fall asleep on my chair, for maybe I would have
woken up from this nightmare. The plot is of no interest : if you
accept the stupid premises of those scientific dreams, you guess very
quickly who will die and who will survive. Waiting for the end, 2 hours
and a half are ten years long. The special effects are rather well
done: they don&#x27;t know they act in a mess, but the editing is loose in
between.<br /><br />Do not waste your time : take a good nap instead.
