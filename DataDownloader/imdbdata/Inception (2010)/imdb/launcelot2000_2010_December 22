i really do not understand that how people say it is a masterpiece it
is a piece of faeces... plagiarism from matrix.. the high rates are
just about some fans of mr Leonardo dicaprio? yes of course the wet
girls who like him vote 10 always..they don&#x27;t watch the film, they
watch their potential dream boy..the film is really very boring and i
couldn&#x27;t wait until it finished and i think the points will be in a
decreasing line in future..worthless film waste of time..and it is an
insult to the films really deserve high points..the perception of
reality is the same in matrix and this must be discussed by the people
who watched this film.this is about money and advertisement of such
Hollywood films they have the ability to show a bad film as a good
one..
