Speechless! That&#x27;s what me and my wife were when we walked out of the
hall having seen this spectacular, mesmerising and fantastic piece of
art. Yes, the depth and the dedication with which Inception is made and
put to life simply cannot be categorised as movie-making but as a
highly evolved art form.<br /><br />I just don&#x27;t know where to start praising the entire team behind the
movie. Right from the script to the sound to the direction to the
special effects to the acting, everything is picture perfect and takes
you into a whole new world, as the script is quite literally meant to
do. Every aspect of the film is so complete and so flawless that it
could have easily masked minor flaws of other bits but go find a
microscope or a telescope, and you wont find any.<br /><br />Well, I cant really go into the details of the movie at all as that&#x27;s
something you need to experience yourself.<br /><br />As for performances, everyone is perfect but simply have to say that
Leonardo just doesn&#x27;t stop surprising me. With recent feats like
Shutter Island, Revolutionary Road, Body of Lies, Blood Diamond, Catch
my if you can, he is just going from strength to strength. At a very
young age of 36 he has achieved what the best have not achieved in
their lifetime.<br /><br />This is surely going to be a cult-movie like Matrix &#x26; Memento. The
movie leaves many impressions and questions in your head that you want
to talk about and understand. And the beauty is that there are no loose
ends, everything is explainable. <br /><br />Go for it if you liked Memento, Shutter Island, The Usual Suspects.
