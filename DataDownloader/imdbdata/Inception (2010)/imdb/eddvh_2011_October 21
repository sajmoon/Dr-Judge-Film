Its Simple.<br /><br />But, should be explained here, just in case.<br /><br />The people who gave this one star, or in fact, anyone who gave this any
less than, say, 8/10 ... just didn&#x27;t get it. <br /><br />Why do i say that? its a pretty bold statement to make, and i am not a
fan of people who making unfounded comments like this, but in this
case, its truly is warranted.<br /><br />If, like me, you&#x27;re a true movie fan, that is, you&#x27;re happy to watch
anything from chick flicks to horror, not only for the acting, but the
score, the production values, the character development, blah blah,
then you must see this movie, you simply must. The story is a little
complex, but the movie is so involving, from the first minute, it grabs
by the scruff of the neck, holds your head back, and forces you to
watch, like car crash reality TV, or rubber-necking from an RTA. Don&#x27;t
get me wrong, there is action, and stunning eye candy, but they are
mere by products, and tools used to tell a story that is so involving,
captivating, complex, yet simple in its idea, that you end up thinking
the 3 hours that had you gripped onto the edge of your seat, with your
mouth open catching flies, was in fact 15 minutes. <br /><br />The cast have been chosen to perfection, and the acting is mixture of
dark and brooding, to subtle yet sarcastic. The movie hits the ground
running, with the character development being a more integral part of
the story than usual, to pack so much into the time provided. The story
has a lot happening, but with your senses craving every second of this,
its easy to get it all on one viewing, i know i am banging on about
this, and no, i am not on commission, the truth is, i so wanted to
slate this movie, but i cant, i really cant, and you shouldn&#x27;t to, yup.
It really is that good. The photography and camera-work in general is
fantastic, and really helps in getting the human element, and pace of
the story across, the score is one of those great scores, where you
cant remember the music, but at the time, it did its job, it lifted
you, it shocked you, it scared you. it was quiet, and is the perfect
foil to the darting photography, the effects are stunning, yet the
story, and movie in general is that good, that they play second fiddle
to everything else. There are certain movies which are infamous, that
is, cult status, this is one of them, or it will be, and is up there
with The Matrix, Blade Runner, going way back to such movies as
Forbidden Planet etc, Movies like this can sometimes be so conceited or
convoluted, that they trip over themselves, or make the viewer feel
either un-involved or bored, or even worse, like they are being
preached to, or in some cases its all a little too high brow, not so
here. While other movies of this genre tip-toe along that very fine
line of getting this type of movie right, Inception hop, skips, and
even moonwalks along that very fine line with consummate ease. <br /><br />So, its a longish movie, but it really does seem like 15 minutes, and
while this movie is the equivalent of the longest 100m sprint ever,
even after the end credits, your left in a stunned state, with the wind
knocked out of you mentally, as Inception has just had its hand down
the front of your pants, and had a good rummage around, leaving you in
a state of shock. And the thing that makes it all really work? its all
so believable, and the real hook is &#x22;i bet they can do that now, or
thats only a few years away&#x22; technology is at a point, or getting to
the point where this really could be around the corner, and the movie
uses this in an eloquent fashion, that is, it leaves you thinking
&#x22;Duuudeee ... are we awake just now?!?!?&#x22;<br /><br />The people who gave this one star, just ... really didn&#x27;t get it. Even
on production values, and quality of the cast, its worth way more.<br /><br />A future classic, and another rare gem to add to that very small list
of movies, that you can watch over, and over, and over again, and
always get something from it.<br /><br />10/10 Miss this, miss out. Its that simple
