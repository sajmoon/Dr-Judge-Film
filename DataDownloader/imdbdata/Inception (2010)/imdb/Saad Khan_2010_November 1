INCEPTION &#x96; CATCH IT ( A+ ) Wow&#x85; A Dream in a Dream in a Dream in a
Dream. Shocking right? But trust me that&#x27;s all Inception is about! Who
thought that our dream world can be so fascinated, I think only Mr.
Christopher Nolan did! Sometimes a movie is so gripping and intriguing
that you forget to take a breath and trust me missing one moment from
this movie is like missing out on the whole story and concept. The
thing I loved about the movie was how beautifully and simply
Christopher Nolan explained his Dream world to us without presenting it
in confusing or disturbing way. Christopher Nolan proves that he is
literally par excellence and his work speaks for him too. Casting
Leonardo DiCaprio was a Brilliant choice, his performance was really
impressive yet Again. Joseph Gordon-Levitt shine this time around and
his Gravity fight was Wow Wow and Wow, I can watch that fight hundred
times, it was just simply one of the most Amazing fight sequences ever
pasteurized on cellulite. Ellen Page was impressive and stands out
among all male ensembles. Marion Cotillard as the deceased wife of Leo
was Amazing, it&#x27;s so good to see her every time in Big movies like
Public Enemies, Nine and now Inception. She stands out in all these
movies in front of Bigger and Senior names than her. Tom Hardy is such
a fantastic new Breeze into the movie, it was his first major big
Hollywood movie and he doesn&#x27;t disappoint at all! Ken Watanabe did a
decent job. Cillian Murphy is a pro and never disappoints. Dileep Rao,
Lukas Haas. Tom Berenger and Michael Cain were good. Overall Inception
is a Mind Boggling, Incredible, Outstanding and Brilliant Modern Master
Piece. The Dream in a Dream in a Dream in a Dream... Wow :-O . WATCH
IT! P.S &#x96; The ending was not a Dream &#x96; Michael Cain
