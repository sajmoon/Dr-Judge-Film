I think the people who are writing the bad reviews of this movie are
those who were not smart enough to follow the whole plot and all of the
movie. This movie is mind blowing and makes you wonder, even in our
lives, whats real and what&#x27;s not. Inception is not a &#x22;shoot em up&#x22;,
although it is packed with action. It is a thriller that will twist
your mind until you decide whether you believe more in reality or
imagination. The most amazing thing is that our society has no idea why
and how we dream. If we ever found more research on dreams...who
knows..this &#x22;inception&#x22; may one day be something remotely possible. PS.
Listen to what they say about remembering your dreams...and see if you
do.
