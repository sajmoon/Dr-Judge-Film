I hope if this fails getting an Academy Awards nomination it wins the
Saturn Award for best picture. It&#x27;s pleasantly confusing and the &#x22;dream
team&#x22; acts adult level and professional. There&#x27;s too many sci-fi films
were researcher heroes supposed to be colleagues working together but I
can&#x27;t believe it for the lack of discipline. Thank God there&#x27;s no love
interest side story that takes attention from the rest of the goings
one. It instead adds deeper sense of tragedy.<br /><br />I was sucked into this world and 20 minutes in I didn&#x27;t know where the
dreams began or the whole thing was a dream. It reminded me of the
twilight zone that the dream technology was refined into an art.<br /><br />I loved Leonardo Di Capro in this, torn by guilt, but staunch on
getting the job and why he wants to succeed.
