I had come across reviews that compare this film to Matrix.
Notwithstanding all its bluster, the first Matrix was built around a
very basic and ancient philosophical argument: which is real, the
physical around us or the world in our minds, i.e. our perception of
the world? Which is worth preserving, the perception or the physical?
In other words, should we take the juicy steak our mind tells us we are
having, or should we make do with the muck? Even the action was wrapped
around this basic argument and it lent its strength to the film, the
first at least.<br /><br />Inception is action packed. It doesn&#x27;t exactly take your breath away,
but it takes you to the end. The images are good, the acting is
alright, you are left with a feeling of satisfaction at the end. But
Inception doesn&#x27;t give you arguments about the nature of dreams or the
human mind. You can find some parallels in a few of the action
sequences, but it doesn&#x27;t give you the same kind of mind-tickling
Matrix gave.<br /><br />Watch it. You will enjoy it for what it is.
