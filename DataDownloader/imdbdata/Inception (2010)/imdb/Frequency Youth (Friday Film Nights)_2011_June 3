The young people have 2 sentences to share their thoughts: Timo: The
cinematography and special effects are spectacular, overall the film is
very good. There are some plot holes however they do not compromise the
overall effect of the film.<br /><br />Rosie: Confusing even after the second time round. But just as
enjoyable as my first watch<br /><br />Chris: Partially agree with Timo&#x27;s thoughts, however the plot holes in
my opinion do hinder the enjoyment. Disregarding the flaws, it is a
phantasmagorically good film, with excellent music.<br /><br />Pete: This is easily my favourite film, so enjoyable. With the numerous
plot lines it means that I can watch it again and again without any
loss of enjoyment.
