Right, i&#x27;ll keep it as short as possible but i will be honest i knew
Inception would be good but I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the amount of detail
and work and thought put into this film; it&#x27;s pretty much a fresh idea
( i am 22, love the diversity of film ,dumb or smart, just as long as
it&#x27;s keeps me entertained and/or thinking. The story, visuals and idea
of this film interests me and the fact it was written by a single
individual named Christopher Nolan. I have admired this man for many
years (The Prestige, Insomnia, Momento, The Dark Knight) and he is
getting better by each film and it&#x27;s the fact that he has made a film
like Inception that has made me admire him even more. I am in no way
going to reveal anything of the plot. I can assume that you have
gathered the basis of the films from the trailers/reviews. To me that
is all you need to know going into this movie; It is utterly brilliant.
For someone like me it requires at least 2 viewings to appreciate the
logic and effort put into a piece of art like this; i had managed to
get the basics and some other important detail of this movie from the
1st viewing along but the greatness and detail of this movie need
multiple viewing. So that you can truly appreciate the genius and
originality of Christopher Nolan. Kudos to that man and happy birthday
to him :D.
