Ugh, where to begin? This is without doubt one of the worst movies I&#x27;ve
ever seen! I know I stand pretty alone in saying this, everyone else
loves it at the moment. I just guess I&#x27;m no fan of surrealist art, and
don&#x27;t get me wrong - this is, if there ever was, a surrealist moving
picture. It&#x27;s like watching James Bond while you&#x27;re high. Y&#x27;know, James
Bond in the sky with diamonds? I guess that doesn&#x27;t really work though.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t know why this film has my dislike. It has good actors, good
jokes and very visually stunning sets. Yes, I know what it&#x27;s about.
Yes, it&#x27;s mostly in a dream. Or, a while in, In a dream of a dream of a
dream of a dream. Yes I get the whole time thing. 5 minutes in
Inception equals 1 hour in reality. Yes I know because it&#x27;s set in a
dream world this gives it license to do surreal things that would
happen in a dream.<br /><br />Stuff it, call me simple but after so long of a Soundtrack that sounds
like a stuck record, landscapes filled with surrealist artwork, people
I can barely hear speak, Jokes that seem out of place and just plain
weird weirdness AND ON TOP OF THAT a story that I didn&#x27;t pick up
interest on when the movie started and I most certainly did not by the
time it finished - it all just seemed like white blur. The snow didn&#x27;t
help much either.<br /><br />To be completely honest I just sat through a movie that most now regard
a masterpiece and was bored out of my skull. When I left I felt
horrible and tense and unsure as to whether or not I just watched
anything at all. I guess it just all blurred together, won&#x27;t be seeing
that again if I can help it.<br /><br />1/10
