What should I say about this movie..?? Trust me, there&#x27;s no other movie
in Hollywood that makes you so involved in it and there&#x27;s no movie such
interesting and fantastic as this..Its the future..Its the
masterpiece..Spectacular, Extravagant, and Magnum Opus.<br /><br />There&#x27;s no need to tell the story because whether you know the story or
nor you&#x27;ll not understand the movie unless you watch it. Though the
story seems little bit confusing and we can&#x27;t understand what actually
it is, Nolan&#x27;s direction eliminates this confusion. It looks more
easier and simpler to understand when we see the film. We will be
completely involved in it and our brains will have no other thought
except the movie. Even I was unable to believe that i really watched a
film that is 2 hrs 28 mins long. There&#x27;s no problem if it is more
lengthy and we would have still enjoyed it.<br /><br />All the actors did their maximum. DiCaprio balanced all the emotions
intelligently and i could say he&#x27;s the perfect match for the
character.I would say Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy are the
special attraction for the movie. Nolan extracted a great level of
talent from Ellen Page and it was her best and convincing performance
till now..Other actors also did well but it&#x27;s a disappointment for me
to see Marion Cotillard for such a short period of time,because I&#x27;m a
fan of her. But however it was meaningful why her role appears for very
less period of time and the character &#x27;Mal&#x27; had its own importance in
the plot.<br /><br />All the technical dept. worked well enough to make the movie more
appealing. I&#x27;m slightly disappointed with the background score, i think
the movie requires more better score. Visual effects are great and it
appears as if everything is really happening.Screenplay was wonderful
and made the movie more simpler to understand.<br /><br />It&#x27;s a Nolan&#x27;s movie guys. One by one there&#x27;s much improvement and
perfection in his films. After a few films I don&#x27;t know how he could
make films more perfectly because when he goes on and reaches 10/10 and
we all increase our expectations,how will be the next one.? Its the
magic of Nolan and he know how to impress us. Never in history was a
director like him.I&#x27;m very much eager to see more and more of his
films.
