Throughout the entirety of the picture I was never saying &#x22;End already&#x22;
or &#x22;When is the bloody climax&#x22;. I was actually glued to the screen at
all times. It was an intense and well thought out movie. Really a
masterpiece, but again, Leo never seems to disappoint. I wouldn&#x27;t like
to give any spoilers. So I won&#x27;t. But all in all, best movie I have
seen in 2010, The Other Guys in close second :D. So please do
yourselves a favor, and see a movie that will truly make you pleased to
be in the theatre. Thank you for reading, much appreciated. And
hopefully you enjoyed this as much as I did, and can now see why it has
a 9.1 star rating :) <br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />herris456
