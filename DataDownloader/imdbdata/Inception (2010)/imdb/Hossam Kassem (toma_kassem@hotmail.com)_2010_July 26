&#x22;How the hell he did that ?&#x22; that&#x27;s what I said after the 2 and half
hours of the non-stop heart-breathing mind-blowing experience , Nolan
performed on us ! how did he just thought about that ? this is not just
another fast-paced action thrilling movie .. no its far beyond that ..
deep far i mean .. taking you in a long fascinating journey , exploring
the human mind with all its complexity , invading the non-limited dream
world , creating almost anything from just your imagination .. i&#x27;ve
never seen something quite like that before .. this is definitely
Nolan&#x27;s masterpiece by far , a pure creation from him , when you
thought he&#x27;ll never top &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22; , he blew you away with this
.. setting on the edge of your seat almost all the movie run-time ,
staring at the screen with opened eyes and fast heart-beating , adding
to all this a fantastic music goes all over there , that&#x27;s just to show
you how magnificent it is !<br /><br />Nothing extraordinary about the acting .. I mean they were all great ,
and each one fit his role totally , and all were in their best , but
nobody delivers a spectacular performance like for example Heath
Ledger&#x27;s Joker .. the characters weren&#x27;t deep enough , and you didn&#x27;t
get passionate enough over any of them , except the main one ( Cobb ) ,
and that&#x27;s the only flaw there .. but , again , the story here and how
it was told , this is what we&#x27;re talking about and what matters the
most .<br /><br />&#x22;Inception&#x22; is that type of movies that keep you thinking , wondering ,
imagining , dreaming and talking about it for days , and perhaps for
months! i didn&#x27;t fully understand it specially the ending , and I
missed so many details , so a 2nd view is a must indeed !
