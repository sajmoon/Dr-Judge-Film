2010_July 25 
No use for repeating the details, all has been said in the 800 and
comments that have been submitted before mine. I just want to add to
the euphoria. I read quite some positive reviews that made me decide to
go watch it (not that I wouldn&#x27;t have gone watch it without reading
them). With expectations sky-high I had prepared myself for a major
disappointment, as that happens quite often after reading too many
movie reviews.<br /><br />No way today. <br /><br />The movie far exceeded those expectations, it&#x27;s #3 in the Top 250 is
absolutely justified. For myself as sci-fi action thriller lover it
even deserves the number 1 spot, it is truly amazing and the best movie
I have ever seen.<br /><br />Genius plot (Where does one get the idea of extractors stealing
in-dream ideas from businessmen? Brilliant!), good actors all settling
the roles of their lives, a story that develops at the exact right
tempo with enough time for character development (I see that runtime is
148 mins, it feels like 60), truly AMAZING effects and an ending that
will leave you flabbergasted in your seat.<br /><br />Go watch it, it&#x27;s mean!<br /><br />10/10
