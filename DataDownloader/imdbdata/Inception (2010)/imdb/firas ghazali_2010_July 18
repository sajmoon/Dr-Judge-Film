This movie is fantastic. It succeeds on so many different levels that
you leave the theatre almost shocked and still trying to absorb all the
info the movie gave you. I think the first 30 minutes are the most
confusing but the characters do a great job in explaining to the
audience (in an indirect way ofcource) how the idea of &#x22;Inception&#x22;
should be performed. I will not ruin the movie for you, therefore all i
will say is that everybody should see this movie. It is a very
&#x22;Original&#x22; movie since the idea behind this movie has never been used
before as far as i know. A great cast from Di Caprio to Ellen Page with
such a genius director in Christopher Nolan makes this movie perfect.
DO NOT MISS THIS MOVIE
