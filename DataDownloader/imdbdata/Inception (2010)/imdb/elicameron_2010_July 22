for starters i have been waiting for this movie since Chris Nolan
announced it, and i just spent the best 13 dollars i ever spent on the
ticket<br /><br />i&#x27;ll keep this review very simple the story, however Chris Nolan came
up with it is mesmerizing and then to adapt that onto a screenplay and
on film is amazing<br /><br />this movie, like most Nolan films has a stellar cast and Leo DiCaprio
shines as does Joseph Gordan Levitt, and i have never been a big fan of
Ellen page but she rises to the task of portraying her character with
belief<br /><br />visually this movie is flawless :spoiler alert: there is a scene in a
hallway of a hotel and plays host to one of the most unique fight
scenes in movie history with an attempt to fight an enemy in no gravity
with 4 wall boundary while in an dream, thats in a dream. this is just
a fraction of the visual amazement<br /><br />all in all Nolan surpasses his previous work including the prestige and
memento in terms of creative and the execution. Nolan&#x27;s finest
achievement a sublime, flawless, incredible ...call it what you want,
this is inception
