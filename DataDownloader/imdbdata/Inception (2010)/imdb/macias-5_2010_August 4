2010_August 4 
The trailers of this movie were great, especially the second one (look
for it on youtube). Great, dark score, mysterious story, superb special
effects, and two great actors.<br /><br />The problem with the movie is, the trailer lasts little longer than 2
minutes, the movie lasts over two hours, and the time is wasted --
there is no mystery here. All good parts are in trailer already, the
movie adds only &#x22;surprising&#x22; twists, but they are not surprising, they
are just like deus ex machina alterations. The characters could even
speak foreign language, it wouldn&#x27;t matter because there is no
cause-effect chain here, most events are incoherent.<br /><br />The movie repeats itself (how this can be interesting?), the moral
struggles of the characters are rather shallow and predictable, and
with constant shifts (now let&#x27;s try something completely different) it
is so unreal (not in sci-fi sense) that I didn&#x27;t even care. Sure,
unreality works for Terry Gilliam because he uses tale scheme, it
worked for The Matrix because it was futuristic message with ancient
background, it worked for Monty Python because it was comedy. But here?
What it is? Monty Python seriously?<br /><br />Speaking of The Matrix, it was 11 years ago, when my mind was simply
blown away. Inception didn&#x27;t even manage to get me interested. You want
a fast paced action thriller, watch The Kingdom (2007), want a
masterpiece of suspense you cannot wait for solution, see The Ghost
Writer (2010), you want an insight of the mind, see The Matrix, again
(1999).<br /><br />Inception just will make you yawn. It is not even the execution, there
was not any good idea for a full feature movie in the first place. The
Matrix succeeded because it explained the whole mechanism and all
pieces of the puzzle fit. Trailer of the Inception explains the
mechanism well enough, there is nothing left to explain in the movie
(and additionally, because of the nature of those two movies, there had
to be a lot of similarities, and there are).<br /><br />I rate it so high (4/10) because I like main actors (yes, Ellen Page is
cute). Every movie rating is a matter of taste but anyway I am totally
surprised Inception is #3 at the charts, my advice -- look for
something maybe not that fresh, but really solid, the one I mentioned
above or Nothing but the Truth, or Syriana, or Body Lies, or The
Departed, or (if you prefer something lighter, for summer), The
Shooter, or... ;-D
