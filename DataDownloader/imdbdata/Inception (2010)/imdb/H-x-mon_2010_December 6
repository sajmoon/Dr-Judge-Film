2010_December 6 
Some reviewers have given this movie a single star where&#x27;s other have
rewarded it 10. There&#x27;s very few in-between. I think 4 stars is apt.
It&#x27;s really not that bad but certainly not a &#x22;movie of the decade&#x22;.
Such a disparity is probably due to the overrated expectations the
Hollywood movie industry and IMDb hype has created. I&#x27;ve heard it being
compared to the Kubrick&#x27;s &#x22;Space Odyssey 2001&#x22;. Not surprising some
film-lovers overreacted. As much as I liked &#x22;Memento&#x22;, I must say Mr.
Nolan ain&#x27;t no Stanley Kubrick. As for the people who rated the movie
as the best thing that has happened to the American cinema since &#x22;The
Sixth sense&#x22;, I can only enviably wish their bliss.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment was probably the plot. Somewhere 45 minutes
in the movie I figured the second twist was for the main character to
discover it was actually him locked in the &#x22;limbo of his own dreams&#x22;
(a.k.a. Hades in the world of Plato a few thousand years before the
idea of our lives being mere reflections of grand &#x22;pure forms&#x22; landed
on Mr. Nolan&#x27;s forehead) and the rest of the gang was trying to drag
him out to the light under a masterful orchestration of his beloved
wife. Unfortunately this second twist never happened. The director
rather awkwardly tried to pull a Lynch-style finale of letting the
viewers to decide whether this entire movie was real or not. This is a
hard trick to pull, since all fictional films are not real and we (the
audience) are quite well aware of it. Although Mr. Lynch sometimes gets
to pull it but he&#x27;s, well, an actual artist. Anyways, it was about as
entertaining for the next 115 minutes as watching a barrel of brandy
mature.<br /><br />I can&#x27;t resist just one more barb to the lavish display of plot holes -
many reviewers have mentioned the utter failure of the storyline to
construct anything resembling a solid structure but I really hope to
point out a previously overlooked nonsense (my apologies for anyone who
has already done so). How is it that one of the most feared &#x22;brain
hackers&#x22; who can mastermind a &#x22;cerebral heist&#x22; of all times, can&#x27;t
arrange for his kids to move some place safe where he can quietly meet
up (or even live) with them? Or forge the documents needed to enter the
country? I mean there are literally thousands of people illegally
crossing the borders into the land of the free every single day and
some of them can barely read English! And somehow this is a major
roadblock for the man who has the power to peek into other people&#x27;s
brains and even plant his ideas in there. For Pete&#x27;s sake! What a
nonsense.<br /><br />P.S.<br /><br />&#x22;Once Zhuangzi dreamt he was a butterfly, a butterfly flitting and
fluttering around, happy with himself and doing as he pleased. He
didn&#x27;t know he was Zhuangzi. Suddenly he woke up and there he was,
solid and unmistakable Zhuangzi. But he didn&#x27;t know if he was Zhuangzi
who had dreamt he was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming he was
Zhuangzi. Between Zhuangzi and a butterfly there must be some
distinction! This is called the Transformation of Things&#x22;<br /><br />4th century BCE
