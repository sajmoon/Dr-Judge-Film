Inception is the most innovative and creative film I&#x27;ve ever seen. THIS
REVIEW IS SPOILER FREE! In fact, telling anyone a thing not known from
a trailer ... well I&#x27;d feel like a jerk. Inception is about technology
that can invade peoples mind for numerous reasons. Christopher Nolan (
Writer and Director ) goes above and beyond exploring the process,
exploring the mind, and exploring the concepts, possibilities, and
well... dreams.<br /><br />Everyone praises James Cameron as the master of visual effects and
whatnot. After seeing Inception I&#x27;m inclined to believe that from
everything but a technical standpoint, James Cameron can only dream of
making visual effects that come even close to evoking the type and
magnitude of emotions that Inception can. Inception is absolutely
awe-inspiring in scope. it&#x27;s not a summer blockbuster thrill-ride, or
an emotional roller-coaster, it&#x27;s the absolute best aspects of both. <br /><br />The script and acting are all phenomenal. Dicaprio gives not an only an
Oscar worthy performance but his best performance ever. it&#x27;s not all
about Dicaprio though as he is surrounded by an ensemble cast with
names such as Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy, and many more. More
importantly, their performances too are incredible. The original score
by Hans Zimmer is as usual outstanding and amplifies the intensity and
emotion within every scene. <br /><br />With and outstanding creative and innovative plot that&#x27;s massive in
scope with substance and a number of eye popping visual effects that
will be forever planted in your mind, amazing direction and acting, and
an amazing score, there is no reason not to watch Inception. Yes the
story is very complex but at the same time everything that&#x27;s important
is easy to grasp. 2 views isn&#x27;t necessary but it&#x27;s worth it. hell, 10
views are worth it.<br /><br />Chris Nolan is no longer chasing directors like Kubrick, Tarantino, or
Scorcese. Chris Nolan is now #1. Between Memento, The Dark Knight, and
Inception, Chris Nolan is the greatest director of our time, one of the
best ever, and one of the most important directors ever.<br /><br />Inception is simply one of the best films ever made and one of about
5-10 movies i&#x27;d ever give an absolute perfect <br /><br />10/10
