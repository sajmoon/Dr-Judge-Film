&#x22;Inception&#x22; attempts to lure you into the world of dreams with its
vivid imagery and trippy sequences. While it certainly is a bit of
eye-candy to behold, the reach of this film far exceeds its grasp.<br /><br />I desperately wanted to like this film. I thought it was going to blow
my mind when I started watching it. The art combined with the subject
matter should have by all means resulted in something amazing, yet it
falls flat on its face. The film could have truly been visionary had it
narrowed its focus, but the themes and attempts at philosophy they try
to present are scattered at best.<br /><br />A little cohesion could have gone a long way. I&#x27;m aware it&#x27;s a Paprika
remake and therefore, about dreams, but that does not mean the writers
can throw things together randomly and expect it to work. Stories are
meant to be followed by an audience, and thus still have limits,
regardless of how absurd the topic is. Even getting rid of a plot
entirely would have been an improvement, but the fact that it tries to
tell a story while only being half-aware of its audience left me with a
feeling of utter disappointment.<br /><br />The film is on the whole pretentious and superficial. On the surface it
pretends to be rich and meaningful but it is ultimately shallow and of
no consequence. I&#x27;m sure it will appeal to the anime subculture which
absolutely eats up Japanese remakes. The style and incoherence of this
film will give them the added bonus of feeling like they &#x22;got&#x22;
something deep, when in reality the movie is devoid of substance.<br /><br />&#x22;Inception&#x22; might be worth seeing for the visuals alone if you haven&#x27;t
seen anything similar before, but only because it comes in at a tedious
3 hours. However, if you&#x27;re a newcomer to anime, please compare this
film to the classic sci Fi anime &#x22;Paprika&#x22;. Anime is so blindly eaten
up by fans that putting more than a little effort into the story is
almost a waste of time. Tripe like this masquerades as being some of
the best the genre has to offer, causing many to ignore some truly
great films.<br /><br />It&#x27;s unfortunate such a talented studio (Warner Bros. Pictures Studios)
is wasting their time on material like this. They&#x27;re an American studio
but paired with a writer on the level of Yasutaka Tsutsui or someone of
similar creativity and story-telling skill, they could accomplish
something truly revolutionary.<br /><br />A note to the aforementioned anime fans: Do your genre a favor and stop
drooling over movies like this so blindly. You can at least pretend to
give a damn about substance and watch half-decent films, like &#x22;Grave of
the Fireflies&#x22; or even &#x22;Spirited Away&#x22;. This genre will forever remain
on the fringes until newcomers can reliably separate the great from the
simply pretentious. For the genre&#x27;s sake and that of your own critical
development: Be a little more picky with your films! And the best part
is, you get to keep the same smug sense of self-satisfaction. It&#x27;s
win-win.
