Wow! That&#x27;s my reaction to pretty much the entire film that
writer-director Christopher Nolan has made called Inception. Since this
is the first movie I&#x27;ve seen of his that isn&#x27;t part of the Batman
series (correction, I did see The Prestige and review it back in 2006),
I just marvel at how creatively compelling his work truly is when he
literally uses his imagination to the fullest of his ability. To make a
more apt comparison: What &#x22;Lost&#x22; is to television, Inception is to the
movies-the ability to truly take you to places you&#x27;ve never been
before. Plus, what a great cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph
Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian
Murphy, Tom Berenger, Marion Cotillard, Pete Postlethwaite, and Michael
Caine among others. All deserve the kudos they&#x27;re getting and more. No
wonder it&#x27;s been No. 1 at the box office these past three weeks! This
movie isn&#x27;t very easy to describe so I won&#x27;t even try. I&#x27;ll just highly
recommend this to anyone who wants their minds challenged to the
fullest extent of their ability and just leave it at that.
