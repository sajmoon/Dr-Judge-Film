Normally I am a very &#x22;idle&#x22; IMDb user who would read reviews but not
write them. The Incepetion reviews however made me reconsider, the
reasons behind it are simple. A 9+ ? Yes the effects are great and yes
the story is original but that does not mean its a great movie. <br /><br />- It&#x27;s lacking consistency - the &#x22;Juno&#x22; girl was clearly miscast-ed -
Half of the movie is about explaining &#x22;the movie&#x22;<br /><br />Let&#x27;s not turn this into a &#x22;titantic&#x22; winning all the Oscars over
&#x22;shawshenk redemption&#x22; and let&#x27;s keep it a &#x22;Avatar&#x22; with just a few
Oscars for the special effects.<br /><br />A.
