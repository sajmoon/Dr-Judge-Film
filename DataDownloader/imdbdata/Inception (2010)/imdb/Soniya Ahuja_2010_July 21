2010_July 21 
When I entered the cinema hall, I had my expectations set high. I had
already seen the rating on IMDb and though the movie was at #86 when I
checked it (it now stands at #3), I was expecting some kind of an
adrenaline rush drama. What I met instead was a mindset so complex that
it left me stunned, amazed, shocked, terrified and thinking long after
the movie was over. Christopher Nolan has created a masterpiece. I had
even enjoyed the movie 2012 a lot, but what differs in Inception is
that it explores a possibility that has not really been explored
earlier in any genre of entertainment.<br /><br />The movie explores the infinite possibilities in which a man&#x27;s
subconscious state can be explored, exploited and in fact manipulated.
The consequences can be grim but what&#x27;s even more fascinating is the
fact that such an idea can actually be translated in to a movie and
that the movie is believable. Leonardo Di Caprio&#x27;s biggest hit since
Titanic. His last movie Shutter Island was definitely a mind bender,
but though Inception does not have any element of suspense - yet it
manages to leave the audience stunned thanks to the lovely inception
that was born in Christopher&#x27;s mind 10 years back. The thought of
manipulating dreams is presented in a manner that not just fascinates
you but also terrifies you. A perfect balance between the good and the
bad is presented in the movie.<br /><br />A must see and a must see again :)
