I heard a number of great things about Inception, including from my
sister who came out saying it was one of the cleverest and best movies
she&#x27;d seen. After seeing it for myself, I thought it was a good film,
but not as good as I was led to believe. Out of the Christopher Nolan
movies I have seen, Inception didn&#x27;t wow me as much as Memento and The
Prestige, and it is one of my least favourites of his so far. Does that
mean the film is bad? No, I am just saying I do not think it is Nolan&#x27;s
best as I have heard people say.<br /><br />My main problem with Inception was the lack of emotional attachment, I
do understand completely anybody who says it is emotionally cold.
Particularly in the characters, they are written and acted well, but
not much is done to make us empathise with them and their predicaments.
I loved the idea of the story, it was clever and somewhat original and
it did start very compelling and intriguing, but as the film progresses
it does become rather convoluted and I found myself losing a little
interest. Also, the pace is uneven, as the characters became more cold
and the story more convoluted, the film really does start to drag until
the conclusion where the film does thankfully pick up.<br /><br />Inception despite these faults does have a number of strengths,
especially the beautifully crafted production values, dream sequences
and effects and Nolan&#x27;s superb direction. Hans Zimmer&#x27;s score is
incredibly good too, while powerful and haunting it rarely becomes
overbearing, while the dialogue is on the whole clever and
thought-provoking. The acting is generally very good, both Leonardo
DiCaprio, with a more hardened persona which has grown even more, and
Ellen Page give strong performances and while Marion Cotillard is
underused she is pretty good as well and Cillian Murphy I think gives
the best supporting performance as he is superb.<br /><br />Overall, Inception is a generally good film but not as good as it is
lauded to be. 7/10 Bethany Cox
