I cannot believe people have voted this movie 9.0. I never critique a
movie just because it does not make sense, I love quite a few extremely
stupid b-movies which are far from making any sense. In my opinion, a
movie can make no sense all right, provided it is still entertaining.
However, this one does happen to make so little sense that it should be
classified as fantasy, not sci-fi, as explained in detail in many
&#x22;Hated It&#x22; comments here. And as for entertainment, Inception, a movie
about dreams, ironically made me so sleepy I barely made it to the end.<br /><br />Basically most &#x22;Loved It&#x22; comments here posit this movie to be pure
&#x22;genius&#x22; because it is so &#x22;complex&#x22; and &#x22;multi-layered&#x22;. If you don&#x27;t
like it, you must be too stupid to understand all the supposedly
mesmerizing, breathtaking and complex &#x22;layers&#x22; or &#x22;levels&#x22;. In short,
an idea that one can dream within a dream either &#x22;blows your mind&#x22; or
you are stupid. Well, okay, maybe it&#x27;s just me. I happen to have been
reading sci-fi since my early childhood, plus virtually all the
software code I write actually represent a complex and multi-layered
virtual reality, so I&#x27;m personally not that impressed. Looks like the
&#x22;Loved It&#x22; guys were truly &#x22;mesmerized&#x22; by the dream-within-a-dream
idea though, must have been quite an intellectual shock for them. I&#x27;m
not saying there is anything wrong with it, only that it&#x27;s not
necessarily a &#x22;genius&#x22; in 2010. I would probably be &#x22;mesmerized&#x22; if I
watched Nolan&#x27;s movie in, say, 1910 (or to be on the safe side, in
1810).<br /><br />The worst was the casting, Leonardo DiCaprio and Ellen Page are good
actors, but their cute &#x26; cuddly faces in a supposedly dark and moody
sci-fi movie? No credibility at all, that completely threw me off. That
choice would be perfect if Nolan was at least shooting for
so-bad-it&#x27;s-good movie. As a result, Inception is
so-average-it-makes-you-sleepy movie.
