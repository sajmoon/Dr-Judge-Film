I don&#x27;t get all the positive reviews for this movie. I found it
overlong and I could not find a reason to care about any of the
characters. Technically speaking, there was no true heroic character,
as it was a bunch of technologically-advanced criminals and their
victims. At several points during the movie I was pleading &#x22;Go home! Go
home!&#x22; It had a decent idea but I have to think that Rod Serling (RIP)
probably could have done a much better job with this and he would have
done it in a shorter time. I really think the writers and producers
could have made a tighter film with better and more interesting
characters. Christopher Nolan did terrific, terrific work with Batman
Begins and The Dark Knight, but this film is unworthy of its success.
