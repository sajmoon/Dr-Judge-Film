In this new film directed by Christopher Nolan (Memento, Dark Knight),
Leonardo Di Caprio stars as Dom Cobb, a skilled thief in a world where
people can steal secrets from other people&#x27;s subconscious by entering
their dreams by using a machine&#x97;this process is called &#x22;extraction.&#x22;
Cobb, an international fugitive for being a master of &#x22;extraction,&#x22; is
offered a chance to get his life back if he does one last job for a
company, where instead of stealing ideas, he is sent to plant an
idea&#x97;this process is called &#x22;inception.&#x22; Working with a team of
extractors to infiltrate a corporate boss&#x27;s heir, Dom finds this
process difficult, as he has to deal with own personal dark memories as
well.<br /><br />When I first heard Christopher Nolan was directing a new, original
movie, I was very excited. He directed Memento, starring Guy Pierce,
one of my favorite and the most mind-boggling cerebral thrillers ever
made. He also made that good ol&#x27; film called Dark Knight, which broke
box office records. His films, often written with his brother, Jonathon
Nolan, tend to be multi-layered, challenging, and many times,
thought-provoking. He is also a great, visual stylist, as can be seen
in the movie. Having seen the movie, and given that this is one of the
films where Christopher Nolan wrote without his brother, I think it
could&#x27;ve helped with an extra edit to clear up and tighten things up.<br /><br />This film is a visual spectacle, and the special effects are nothing
short of breathtaking. Buildings fold on each other like Dark City,
characters are tumbling and jumping off walls, and stairs sometimes go
on forever not unlike something from M.C. Escher. Many things go on in
this film. The fuzziness of reality and memory recalls writings of
Phillip K. Dick. There are lots of action scenes. The plot gets
convoluted. I felt a slight numbness in my brain keeping track of
everything in this movie, as many things are happening simultaneously.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts in the film, and an important subplot, was
when Cobb&#x27;s memory of his wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), interferes with
his job during a dream sequence, where we get to know more about Cobb&#x27;s
psychology and his darker secrets. Leonardo Di Caprio gives his usual
best as the mentally complex Cobb. Marion Corillard is memorable as the
figment of his memory of his wife. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is in physical
good form as Arthur, who has the world turned upside down on him
(literally). The rest of the cast is competent, but we don&#x27;t really get
to know them in a deep level.<br /><br />The problem with the plot for me was the fuzzy nature of the
dream-world itself&#x97;one can ask many questions that could go on forever.
Having been familiar with films like Dreamscape and Nightmare on Elm
Street, I have always assumed pretty much everything was possible in a
dream world. The dream world in this film is much closer to reality,
but I couldn&#x27;t exactly understand the established limits of possibility
within that reality. For example, why can&#x27;t someone be bulletproof if
you know it&#x27;s a dream? Things get stranger when people enter a dream
within that dream using the device--this was the part where the plot
got a bit too convoluted for me. In my logic, if a dream is an
illusion, an illusion within an illusion is basically the same illusion
except it&#x27;s only making us think it&#x27;s a different kind of illusion&#x97;but,
I won&#x27;t expand on that. Simply put, I think the script should&#x27;ve
cleared up better on how dreams operated in this particular world.<br /><br />I might have appreciated this film more on a smaller budget. It
could&#x27;ve been a more cerebral film that explored the concepts more
deeply than have it covered with action scenes with everything
happening in elaborate ways. Similar to how I felt about Steven
Spielberg&#x27;s A.I., the budget appeared to exceed the need of the film&#x27;s
concept, even if the effects were cool. It also reminded me of Charlie
Kaufman&#x27;s Synecdoche, New York, a similarly cerebral, yet equally
plot-heavy film, about a theater director who creates a life-size
replica of New York inside a big warehouse and within that warehouse is
another smaller warehouse with a smaller replica, and on, and so forth.
Like that film, this film seems to get lost in its excess of plot ideas
it wants to explore. Perhaps it might&#x27;ve worked better as a
mini-series.<br /><br />Overall, I felt the film could&#x27;ve been tighter and trimmed. There are
many action scenes that didn&#x27;t really contribute to the plot and
occasionally seemed to slow down the film, such as the James
Bond-influenced gunfight in the mountains. One of the problems about
films about dreams is that one assumes a character is never in any real
trouble and no action seems extraordinary (while it may be surprising
in real life), thrilling, or risky, because it&#x27;s all &#x22;illusion,&#x22; if you
will. When the plot had the character go within a dream within a dream
within a dream, it was just a bit too much for me. The concept is
interesting, and there are certainly no movies like it, but there
appears to be an overload of too many things going on.<br /><br />For more of my reviews, you can also follow me on
