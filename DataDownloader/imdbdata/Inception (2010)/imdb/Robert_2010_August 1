It is probably just me since movies like The Matrix bore me to tears
but I literally could barely stay awake during this nonsense. I am
quickly coming to the conclusion that the Leonardo Di Caprio school of
acting involves simply glowering and clenching his jaw during every
scene. If you loved The Matrix you will probably like this but if you
found The Matrix to be as boring as I did then you may want to avoid
losing two hours of your life on this. Some of the computer graphics
were compelling but this is strictly The Matrix from a different
perspective and just as uninteresting. Go rent Fargo or some other
decent movie and avoid wasting your time on this nonsense!
