I love Chris Nolan - a lot. I waited in a line for hours to see The
Dark Knight, and I just don&#x27;t do that for movies. I also really respect
Leonardo DiCaprio and Joseph Gordon Levitt.<br /><br />I just don&#x27;t get the BEYOND insane amounts of love for this movie. It
was a REALLY REALLY good summer blockbuster. Unlike most summer
blockbusters it was smart and somewhat intellectually stimulating. I
just in no way see how people are claiming this as a &#x22;movie that might
be a religion in a decade&#x22; or the other overflow of hyperbole that
people have used to describe this movie.<br /><br />It was a GREAT movie, it was fun AND interesting, which is more than
you can say for most big budget movies like it, but come on. People say
things like this: &#x22;That being said, there was still a lot about this
film I still don&#x27;t get, and may require multiple viewings to better
understand.&#x22; I&#x27;m sorry but watch it a second time, and you will realize
this isn&#x27;t really true.<br /><br />GREAT movie, as evidenced by my 7/10 (id honestly like a 7.5 - oh well)
but, a movie that spawns a religion? A movie that deserves to be the
4th best of all time? No way.<br /><br />At the same time, people giving it a 5 or less and slagging it off as
awful. Umm. Good luck with your top of the line expensive movies that
aren&#x27;t garbage, you&#x27;ll be begging for another Inception, and if
Christopher Nolan only made Inception-quality movies for the rest of
his life, I&#x27;d be MORE than happy with that.
