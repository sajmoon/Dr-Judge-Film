Now here is a movie which actually managed to thrill me without showing<br /><br />high voltage mind less actions.The movie is a continuous flow of
informations too interesting to ignore. The visuals,what can i say
seriously felt like slipping into dream in some scenes. i was wondering
how it got me on the edge when i never completely knew what is going
on. we don&#x27;t actually see the movie but rather<br /><br />collect the informations.the movie begins only after the final scene.
Thats what his style is. Nolan is 15 years ahead of Hollywood in
conceptualization and visual treatment. However i happen to read the
negative reviews as well. some were complaining about its pace while
some feel the characters are under developed some didn&#x27;t like the whole
dream concept while some wanted the dream to be more imaginative and
contorted. first of all accept the movie for what it is.deforming the
dream or giving more color to a character would shift the focus away
from the story they are intending to tell.a well made movie can only go
bad if you have different or heightened expectations for the movie.it
can ruin the whole movie experience as a result a disconnect from the
movie.and end up blaming it.i would suggest those reviewers to analyse
a movie from outside. rather than just following the story and feel
good factors. observe how they are executing and bringing the effect on
screen .learn to appreciate other aspects too which goes into movie
making. A difficult concept or a story line can challenge even a
veteran director.but directors like nolan is going against it.showing
us how a strong visions can overcome obstacles in movie making. This
movie is a refreshing change from otherwise boring sci-fi flicks coming
out these days. The rating of 10 is what usually is given to a movie of
such scale and grandeur. I want many such movies.The movie which can
actually beat this one.a 9 from my side in hope of a better one.
