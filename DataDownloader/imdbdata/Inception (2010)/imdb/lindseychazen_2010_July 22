2010_July 22 
I didn&#x27;t have high expectations coming into this movie, but when I
left, I decided this was one of the best films I had ever seen. This is
certainly Nolan&#x27;s best work. The acting is exceptional, the story line
is mind-blowing, and the action is fantastic! Nolan&#x27;s film kept me on
the edge of my seat the entire 2+ hours. The last hour of the film has
to be the greatest theater experience I&#x27;ve ever had. I saw Inception
twice, as I heard you will get more out of it the second time, which
was very true. If you are unclear on some things the first time you see
it, go again! It&#x27;s even better the second time. You will be thinking
about this film days after you see it, and probably have some very
intense dreams. 10/10
