I am astonished by the reviews posted. My only explanation is that this
deadly dull movie put everyone else to sleep and they thought they saw
a better movie. The performances were very lackluster and the actors
all (except for Tom Hardy) looked like they were performing in their
sleep.There was no reason for any of the characters to be involved in
this plan from a personal motivation reason, and their behaviours were
completely arbitrary. Did they get paid for their time or was there
some other reason to what they were doing in this scheme with the main
character? I felt no connection or empathy for the main character or
his motivation. There was no sense of unreality or mystery one would
expect in a dream. The action sequences were dull and seemed to be just
shooting people because there was a perceived need to have some gun
fire. I struggled to stay in the theatre and see it through let alone
stay awake.
