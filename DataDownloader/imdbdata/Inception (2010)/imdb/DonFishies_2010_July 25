As I read reviews, theories and just general thoughts on Inception, it
baffles me how so many people seem to be able to put their ideas about
the film into words. I instantly knew how I really felt about the film
less than a second into the credits, but trying to comprehend
Christopher Nolan&#x27;s daring vision, much less attempting to put it into
words, is one of the hardest tasks I have had to do for such a recent
film. That alone should tell you the power and gravitas this
brilliantly conceived pseudo-blockbuster has and will continue to have
an effect on audiences.<br /><br />In true genre-bending form, Inception revolves around Dom Cobb
(Leonardo DiCaprio), a man whose occupation is to literally steal the
dreams of others. Using a rather incredibly looking device, Cobb can
enter a person&#x27;s dreams and literally extract their most treasured
secrets. After a botched attempt on Japanese businessman Saito (Ken
Watanabe), the man comes back to Cobb with a proposition. Instead of
stealing an idea, he wants Cobb to plant an idea into the mind of oil
company heir Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy) &#x96; the act of which is
called Inception. Cobb has his doubts about whether Inception could
work, but he brings a team together, and then the real mindbending fun
begins.<br /><br />Without a doubt, Inception is Nolan&#x27;s enigmatic masterpiece. The film
was hyped for months, but I can still not help but feel it came out of
nowhere in how much of a chord it strikes. It is the kind of film that
only comes around very infrequently, and tends to not have people
talking until years after its release. But this film is far from a
predetermined cult classic. This is an unequivocal blockbuster of the
highest degree &#x96; one that never falters from its lofty and pseudo
intellectual ideals. It obviously owes more than a small amount of
gratitude to The Dark Knight for even being able to get made in the
first place, but even more to the likes of The Matrix, Dark City, Blade
Runner, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and so many more like
them.<br /><br />The praise for this film comes specifically out of the script and the
sheer ideas driving the film. Dreams and the imagery behind them are
inherently difficult ideas to grasp. There are whole sects of
researchers and theorists who devote their lives to understanding them,
yet after an initially staggering explanation, Nolan manages to make
sense of them and develop a whole film based around them. It is more
than enough to chew, but it is still easily digestible. What occurs as
the film goes on may baffle some viewers, but that is the beauty of the
whole project. It develops and extrapolates on deep ideas rarely seen
in the realm of summer movies, and even movies in general. There is
just so much inherent ambition and drive to the film that you wonder
why there are so few filmmakers willing to take the plunge into this
kind of reckless, thought-provoking filmmaking.<br /><br />The film is also stunning in how majestically edited it is. Incredible
special effects, camera angles, and wire acrobatics are only the
beginning of how stuffed this film is. The running time was always the
only problem I had with The Dark Knight, and I feared it would work
against Inception as well. But the opposite happened. Inception feels
all too short by its ending, as if it could have been longer. The film
is a riveting, edge of your seat experience at any given time. It packs
on the action, drama, suspense, and thrilling moments at every turn,
grabs you, and never lets up. I actually am quite certain I forgot to
breathe during the last twenty minutes of the film, and struggled to
look away during everything that came before it. It is just that
strong, and that unique of a picture. It is the rare type of movie that
ends, and you immediately will want to watch it again, no matter how
long it is.<br /><br />After an astonishing turn in Shutter Island (a film whose storyline and
themes play all too close to this one), DiCaprio still manages to
launch this film out of the park. He has just as much wild audacity
on-screen as Nolan does off-screen, and he plays it with such
recklessness that you can barely even attempt to think of someone else
coming close to playing Cobb as great as he does. The man never lets
up, and only intensifies himself as each scene passes. He is the
emotional crux of the picture, and is just as riveting and spellbinding
as the picture itself. He knows just what moves to make, what emotions
to hit, and what chemistry he needs to have with the rest of the cast.<br /><br />My only real problem with the movie, outside of it being so enigmatic,
ambiguous and generally left to the audience&#x27;s own imaginations, is
that the film has very little character development for anyone other
than Cobb. As great as she is in her supporting role, Ellen Page&#x27;s job
as Ariadne is to explain the film and its mindbending concepts to the
audience. Joseph-Gordon Levitt gets quite a bit of time to shine, but
Tom Hardy and Dileep Rao get far too little to do. Watanabe, Murphy and
an absolutely incredible Marion Cotillard are the only ones who seem to
get some form of development, but not nearly enough.<br /><br />In the end, I know further analysis and multiple rewatches will negate
this small gripe, but as it is, Inception is the must-see movie of the
summer and the first great movie of the decade. Nolan has truly
delivered a film I can only think to call brilliant. This is the type
of magical filmmaking that only comes around too little. Everyone who
enjoys watching films, no matter the kind of film-goer, owes it to
themselves to experience Inception.<br /><br />9.5/10.
