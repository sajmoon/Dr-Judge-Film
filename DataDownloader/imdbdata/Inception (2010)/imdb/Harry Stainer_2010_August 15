If I could ask Christopher Nolan one question,Just one it would be How
do you do it ? Bringing one amazing film after the other each one
better than the last. Yet this is truly his masterpiece. one thing you
should know about this film is the less you know about it before seeing
it the better it is and that it is not the most easiest film to follow.
I really want to to hate this film but you just can&#x27;t it builds you up
and hits you were it hurts. Its a must see you can&#x27;t not just simply
love this film. DeCaprio is outstanding as Cobb you just forget its
him. lets say if you have to see one film this year it has to be this.
An amazing film well worth seeing, Well done to Christopher Nolan once
again.
