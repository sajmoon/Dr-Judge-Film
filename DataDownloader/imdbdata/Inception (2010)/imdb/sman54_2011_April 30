Regardless of your thoughts concerning the lack of character
development, the seemingly conformist message (for lack of a better
term)and other various imperfections, this movie goes above and beyond.<br /><br />From a pure film making standpoint, it&#x27;s a masterpiece. The story is
fast paced enough, even for a 2 hour and 30 minute film, to keep you
interested and keep the movie going. The characters are interesting (at
least most of them) and the acting is good enough to fill the holes.<br /><br />The presentation is extraordinary. The action is frantic. The multiple
atmospheres are all gripping. The plot is enthralling.<br /><br />In conclusion, to keep this simple, this movie should be watched by
anyone who appreciates film or is looking for a great movie to watch.
