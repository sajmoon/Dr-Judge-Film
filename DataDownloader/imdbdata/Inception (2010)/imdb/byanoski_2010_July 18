I was beginning to think there wouldn&#x27;t be a good movie in 2010. I was
wrong. This is it. Honestly, this is probably one of the best movies in
the last five years.<br /><br />This film is not just an action movie, but a thriller, a romance and a
drama all intertwined into one. The visuals are one thing but the
script is phenomenal. Everything from the very beginning to the very
end all makes sense and comes together in one finely crafted work of
art. This film is most definitely a work of art.<br /><br />The acting is fantastic as well. Leonardo puts on another great
performance as always and some of the cast you aren&#x27;t used to seeing in
a movie such as this make it what it is. Ellen Page, who we all know
from Juno, took an entirely different role and made it her own and she
nailed the part. Her part in this film was crucial to its success. The
last I had seen of Joseph Gordon-Levitt was Brick in 2005. I had not
seen any of his other movies since then. Brick was another really smart
film that he played so well. In Inception, although he had few lines
compared to the other actors, his persona was so great that it was
awesome just to see him on screen.<br /><br />Few movies have been released of this caliber and I think Nolan is
going to be remembered as one of the best directors of all time because
although he has made few movies, they have all been amazing. This is no
exception.<br /><br />Go see it...and don&#x27;t wait until it is out on DVD or Blu Ray. This
movie HAS to be seen in theaters.
