I haven&#x27;t written any reviews for this site, but I feel that given the
varying opinions going around, I should throw in my 2 cents. I loved
Inception. I loved the acting, everyone gave a good to great
performance. I loved the stunning action sequences, from the shootouts
to the fight scenes. I loved Nolans direction during the dreams, from
the building to the destrucion of them. And I loved the premise of the
movie, going into dreams, experimenting with different levels of
dreams, how the dreams can change, this movie is incerdably original.
Now, I&#x27;m not saying that this movie is perfect. Cobb and Fischer are
the only character who go through development, though the rest of the
characters have enough personality for you to be entertained by them.
This is a film that focuses on the plot, and it shows. There were some
parts of the movie that confused me, but none that I weren&#x27;t able to
figure out later. The story is complicated, but has no plot holes.
Overall, Inception is a movie that you should definitely check out.
