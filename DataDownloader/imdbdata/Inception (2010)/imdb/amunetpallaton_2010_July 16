I just cannot explain how awesomely awesome this movie is.
Overwhelming, but in a completely good way is a very good word to
explain this. The actors were all SO fantastic. There wasn&#x27;t one of
them that wasn&#x27;t completely believable in their role. The FX were just
spectacular and really helps to transport you in to this movie. The
story and whole concept of this Inception thing and how they do it just
totally blows your mind. I mean it really does. This movie made me feel
like I had been sitting on the edge of my seat and holding my breath. I
could not wait for the next whatever to happen and to see how
everything played out.
