I liked everything about this film In my opinion this film is a break
through in film making.<br /><br />The story is so fresh and told in a different environment than usual. I
liked Nolan&#x27;s script and Zimmer&#x27;s music was great There was never a
dead spot in this film. I&#x27;m going to see this film again in theaters
and I am defiantly going to buy it on DVD.<br /><br />The Acting was great and this film includes one of the longest,
weirdest and best action scene I have seen on the screen <br /><br />After watching this film I got goosebumps This film woke up a lot of
questions for me and made me think.<br /><br />This is defiantly one of the best films I have ever seen with out a
doubt.<br /><br />10/10
