First of all, this movie is insanely brilliant, it totally lived up to
the hype. &#x22;What is the most resilient parasite? An Idea!&#x22; I couldn&#x27;t
agree more! Chris Nolan once again shared his wonderful and brilliant
imagination and gave something much more than a summer blockbuster,
this is truly an instant classic and deserves the highest respect.
First of all, I couldn&#x27;t believe that thus was a &#x22;one man project&#x22;, the
man wrote, directed and shot and post produced the damn thing, all by
his self...and on such a high level....simply mind blowing! The script
is so well written, so original, so amusing, doesn&#x27;t have any holes
into it...the direction is perfect, the cast, on top with Leo Di
Caprio, who is, let&#x27;s face it, a &#x22;hall of fame actor&#x22;, it totally
delivers! There is never a dull moment, the 2:30 hours pass like
minutes, your jaw never has the time to picks itself up, you&#x27;re
constantly exploited to the pure genius of film-making, scenes that
will never leave your head, and keep you replaying them in your mind on
the way home...There is only one word to describe the cinematography,
the set designs and the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You
don&#x27;t just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a
real blast. The action scenes are well presented and done to
perfection, and the music by Hans Zimmer is totally haunting. In the
whole movie there&#x27;s never a chance to move your eyes from the screen,
cause it has so much layers, so much going on.. Do yourself a favor,
don&#x27;t wait to watch Nolan&#x27;s perfect movie, pay the ticket and see it in
the theater and have your mind blown away in style....
