In the beginning i could not understand it. but slowly i started
understanding it. The movie explains itself slowly as the time passes.
Its a brilliant movie for all reasons, acting picturisation concept and
every thing. But the best thing about the movie is the concept.<br /><br />Nolan has put a very vast thought in the movie. you will really
appreciate his thought. Its a masterwork. no storyline is even near to
it. It is for me far far better than shawshank or even 12 angry men.
Its a completely original thought. So all i want to say is that just go
and see this movie. but be patient while watching the movie. each and
every word is relevant. It will turn out to be your best movie of life
time.
