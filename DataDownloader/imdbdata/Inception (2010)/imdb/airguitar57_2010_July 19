Christopher Nolan is a genius. Yeah, I said it and I mean it. Nolan is
producing the most consistently great films and in the current world,
he is one of the best directors out there. In a summer film season that
has generated little excitement, with the exception of Toy Story 3,
Inception is a reason to head to the theater.<br /><br />Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an Extractor. That means he slips into your
dreams and steals your secrets. Having developed a reputation as the
best at what he does, Cobb is approached by Saito (Ken Watanabe) to
accomplish a rare feat, planting an idea in someone&#x27;s mind, or
inception. Normally I give a little more detail in these summaries,
while always remaining spoiler-free, but this is all I&#x27;m offering up.
If you want to see Inception, and you should, I suggest avoiding
learning as much as you can about the film&#x27;s story. There are great
articles all over the internet about Inception but resist temptation.
Going into the film, I planned on knowing as little as possible. I
avoided articles like the plague and limited myself to the first teaser
trailer and the unavoidable television commercials. This film deserves
your full attention and going in with as blank a slate as possible is
the best way to view it.<br /><br />Just take a second to look at the cast list. Leonardo DiCaprio is the
lead and emotional center of the entire film. If you don&#x27;t believe that
DiCaprio is one of the greatest actors working today then there is
something wrong with you. He gets better with every film he makes and
with Shutter Island and now this film offering his two best
performances of his career, with the possible exception of What&#x27;s
Eating Gilbert Grape, the guy deserves all sorts of Oscar gold. The
film rides on his shoulders and DiCaprio carries it regally. Joseph
Gordon-Levitt, who is thankfully developing quite the film career, is
great as Arthur, the Point Man. His acting is spot-on and he shines in
the action role. By doing a great deal of his own stunts there is an
authenticity to his performance that doesn&#x27;t go unnoticed. I could
write an entire column on the cast alone. Tom Hardy, Ellen Page, Ken
Watanabe, Cillian Murphy and a short treat of an appearance by Michael
Caine, there isn&#x27;t a weak performance in all of Inception. Every actor
brings his A-game. With a film concept that is quite abstract any
misstep by the cast could result in nothing less than a distraction.
Each character is infused with a believability and honesty that
surrendering yourself to the world of the film is done without a second
thought.<br /><br />Before discussing the brilliant direction of Christopher Nolan, I think
it is just as important to give credit to the people that helped to
create the world of Inception. First, is cinematographer Wally Pfister.
The film literally takes place in a dream world and Pfister captures it
beautifully. Pfister is a longtime Nolan collaborator and the two have
found a way to bring the images of the mind to the screen, sucking you
in with such ease. I found myself thinking that the film was so
visually appealing that it could work silently, but I quickly stopped
as Hans Zimmer&#x27;s score wrapped me in its warm arms. Amazingly, Zimmer
composed the entire score without seeing the film, yet thanks to some
cinematic god, he appears to have shared the same vision as Nolan. The
score elevates the film to such an extent that it is hard to imagine
one without the other.<br /><br />The current film climate is crowded with unoriginality. I cringe as
film&#x27;s based on board games are green-lit or another parody film comes
to fruition. Often I find myself, like an old man, yearning for the
originality of yesterday. This is why I am thankful for Christopher
Nolan. He is able to create a world that is both fantastic and
tangible. It is difficult to compare Inception to another film since
there is nothing else like it. The film&#x27;s story and structure is
complex, however under the direction of Christopher Nolan every
component works.<br /><br />There are few directors currently making films that are consistently as
brilliant as Christopher Nolan. With Inception, he offers up his best
and most satisfying to date. I cannot find a flaw in the film. The
acting is superb. The score is engaged in a beautifully symbiotic
relationship with the film itself and the cinematography is
breathtaking. The most important aspect of any film is the story and
Inception delivers. It is safe to say that the film&#x27;s story is one of
the most original and fascinating of any film in the past decade. This
film is what others should aspire to be. To find a film that is thought
provoking, exciting and aesthetically pleasing is rare. The film is the
result of every cinematic puzzle piece falling into the right place.
Inception is a shining beacon of originality and excellence.
