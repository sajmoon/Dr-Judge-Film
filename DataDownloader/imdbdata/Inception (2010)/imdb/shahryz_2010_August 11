I watched Inception a month late after its release date, so I had to
deal with the constant hype in the news, on the net, and just about
every you looked there was something about it. I managed to keep it
spoiler free for myself, and after that whole month, my expectations
for this movie were so high I was expecting to just barely make it.<br /><br />But I was so wrong, this move trumped anything I could possibly fathom.
Right from the start, the movie sucks you in, and with the brilliant
composition by Hans Zimmer, this entire film is a constant flow, and
doesn&#x27;t give you a chance to think about what&#x27;s going to happen next,
because it just keeps bombarding you with new information. <br /><br />I watched it a second time the day after, and I must say, that this
movie is a master piece. The details are so intricate and everything
just falls into place. Many disagree, that there are some things up for
interpretation, but having seen it twice now, and read almost every
review out there, I can safely say that the story is flawless.<br /><br />I wish the rating system was different for this specific title because
10 stars doesn&#x27;t do it justice.
