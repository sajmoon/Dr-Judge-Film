2011_December 15 
Once every so often there is a film which just takes the breath away
from all who watch it and inception is by far one of those films. The
story line and concept is truly remarkable and sounds like something
you would learn in A-level physics. The director (Christopher Nolan)
has made another Oscar winner along with the dark knight and batman
begins.The film does seem like its never going to end but i believe
that Nolan doesn&#x27;t dumb down for the audience and tells the story how
he likes it. Yes the film isn&#x27;t a easy-watch by any means and it runs
for a meaty 148 minutes but it is 148 minutes of: clever plot, sensible
action scenes,superb acting from di caprio and put all that together
and you have the greatest film of 2010&#x85;
