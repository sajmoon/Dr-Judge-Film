This is the worst film I&#x27;ve seen in a long time. I think I can imagine
what other people who are raving about the film like; but I can
guarantee that the rating of this film will plummet in a year when the
slight novelty of the special effects wears off. <br /><br />The &#x22;story&#x22; here is the story of a role-playing video game, where you
get trapped into deeper and deeper levels without knowing what to
expect. As you go, the rules change. This is convenient for the
writers, who simply make it all up as they go along. <br /><br />If you liked Matrix, you will like this film. You will probably like
Titanic, Avatar, and other films that dangle flashy special effects in
front of your eyes. If you would rather play a video game than read a
book, you might like this film.<br /><br />If on the other hand you like dramas about human beings, then skip this
one. It&#x27;s a waste of time and money.
