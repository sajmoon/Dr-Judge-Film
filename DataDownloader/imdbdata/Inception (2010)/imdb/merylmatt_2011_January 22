I think you have to enjoy the abstract, appreciate the artist Escher
and are not annoyed by is this reality, a dream, an illusion. Is this
my world, or am I a dream in your world? Does it have plot holes? Of
course! It&#x27;s science fiction! Does it have similarities with the Matrix
series? Yes, it also has incredible special effects. Is this the most
intellectual, mind blowing movie you&#x27;ll ever see? I don&#x27;t think so, but
I was very entertained by the combination of the special effects and
the plot was good enough that I&#x27;ll watch it again.<br /><br />I&#x27;m not overly concerned with what Director Nolan set out to do -is he
trying to be an artist or make a statement? It doesn&#x27;t matter to me, I
enjoyed this movie. It&#x27;s far better than just a blockbuster popcorn
film, but it has a lot of action, explores the concept of reality and
while I won&#x27;t loose any sleep over it, did make me go, hmmm.
