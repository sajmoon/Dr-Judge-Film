Typical Christopher Nolan&#x27;s movie like Momento.. except it is three
level&#x27;s deeper! Everyone in the theater was on the edge of the seat for
the entire film. For the entire duration of the film i was in a
different world experiencing whole new thing which i have not
experienced before...i was with strange taughts while watching movie
like what will be next frame, how will this movie end, what is director
trying to convey, or am i dreaming.<br /><br />If you wanna feel the way i felt you have to watch the movie.
Personally i watch comedy movies to enjoy and refresh myself. Even
tough after watching this movie i was mentally drained ...there is
something in this movie that is worth watching for. I have given eight
out of ten because i felt it lacked consistency in imagination.
