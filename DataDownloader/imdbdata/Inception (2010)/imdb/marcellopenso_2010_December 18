For the amount of effort that went into this production, I found the
result to be ultimately pretty dull. Like nearly 99% of what has come
out of Hollywood in the past 15 years or so, this film has loads of
technique but little heart. It offers little to care for, and therefore
little to remember.<br /><br />Yes, there&#x27;s some fancy graphics, but that&#x27;s about it. The internal
logic of the nested dreams is routinely disrupted, the action sequences
don&#x27;t make much sense (why all the shooting, really?) and none of the
characters are emotionally involving. Di Caprio&#x27;s character has a
nominal story arc at best, and the angst he&#x27;s supposed to feel is not
grounded because we don&#x27;t know neither his nor his wife&#x27;s history, or
how they got together.<br /><br />Yes, Inception is a fun mind game. But like most mind games, it
ultimately doesn&#x27;t make for a worthwhile experience. And at 2.5 hours
this mind game is far too overblown. Its lack of proportion (too much
talk, too many levels, too much trivial action, complicated for the
sake of complicated) unfortunately makes things worse. The incessant
music, typical of Zimmer, is trivially repetitive, as are much of the
action sequences. Ultimately these become much more intrusive and
annoying as the film progressives.<br /><br />When I compare this film to older ones, like The Woman in the Window,
which achieves so much more of a memorable experience and story, yet
with so little, one has to wonder if technology and truckloads of cash
are getting in the way of memorable storytelling.<br /><br />This film would have fared much better as a comedy, or maybe as
round-table discussion about dreams, or maybe as a survey of a Facebook
clique of friends sharing dreams. But the film needed to have far more
fantasy to really evoke the sensation of dreamscapes. And most
importantly, it needed a far more soulful and compelling story with
characters we are allowed to learn about and therefore care about.
