If you like action movies and are short of gray matter, you&#x27;ll love
this one. But if you have a brain, or even half of one, you&#x27;ll want
your money back.<br /><br />This dreadful piece of trash is the biggest wast of money, both mine
and the producers&#x27;, that I believe I&#x27;ve ever seen. <br /><br />Intellectually incoherent, VERY bad acting, mediocre special effects.
needlessly convoluted plot and worst of all, completely pointless. All
the actors are talented (except Marion Cotillard, who couldn&#x27;t act her
way out of a paper bag, in English anyway), but they were all just
phoning it in.<br /><br />All the positive reviews, of which there are&#x97;unfortunately&#x97;many, never
mention how great the &#x22;Story&#x22;or &#x22;plot&#x22; is. The mental midgets who like
it rave and rave and rave about the special effects. Well, my dear
thinking, tasteful friends, that should tell you something. <br /><br />Do not go see this movie unless you are escaping open-air radiation.
