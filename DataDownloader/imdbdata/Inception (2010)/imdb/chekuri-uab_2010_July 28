There is a clear hole in the plot, that is when Murphy(the
subject/victim) makes a transition back from Level1 to Real world
Level0. Here is the explanation stimulations.blogspot.com/2010/07/
is-there-hole-in-plot-of-inception-or.html what follows is my
understanding of the chronology of subject&#x27;s state of mind and his
perceptions during the length of the story. From what is being
presented in the movie, i see that the objective of Dicaprio&#x27;s team was
not actually met!! Why i think that way would hopefully be apparent
towards the end. May be i am missing some point but please feel free to
comment.<br /><br />Objective of DiCaprio&#x27;s team: Implant a new idea/thought in the mind of
Subject at Level 0. That is- by the end of the process, the subject in
Level 0 should be aware/know with authenticity, about a NEW important
information &#x27;xyz&#x27; previously unknown to him<br /><br />Subject&#x27;s/Victim&#x27;s(Cillian Murphy) State of mind:<br /><br />Level 0: Traveling with bunch of guys in a plane. Duration of journey
is 10hrs.<br /><br />Level1: Doesn&#x27;t know that he is dreaming. He thinks it is real world.
Inception team is his enemy and is harmful to him. His
Godfather/Adviser(Tom Berenger)is a good man.<br /><br />Level2: Initially doesn&#x27;t know that he is dreaming. He thinks it is
real world Later, Dicaprio convinces him that, -this is a dream world,
where his godfather is trying to extract info from him and Level 1 is
the actual real world. -and that subject&#x27;s Godfather knows some very
important info relating to Business empire, which need to be extracted
from him.<br /><br />Subject friends with DiCaprio&#x27;s team.<br /><br />Level3: Knows he is dreaming. But still thinking that Level1 is real
world, Level2 is Dream and now thinks he entered into Level3 which is
the Dream of his Godfather(Berenger), to extract some valuable info.<br /><br />Level 4: Dead/Inanimate Ms.Page gives him a kick so that he could wake
up/go live and continue on with his work back in Level 3<br /><br />Level 3:<br /><br />Now he extracted valuable info from the subconsciousness of Berenger.
Goes through some Father-child emotion and changes his future
direction. (From Dicaprio&#x27;s perspective, New thought implanted into
Subject&#x27;s mind.(But notice new thought which is real with respect to
only Level1 subject but not Level 0 subject ))<br /><br />Level 2: Knows he is dreaming. Thinks he is Just one level from Real
world which for him has been Level 1. Thinks that with the help of his
friends, he successfully extracted some valuable info(previously
unknown to him) from his godfather&#x27;s dream<br /><br />Friends with DiCaprio&#x27;s team Equipped with New info he extracted from
his god father&#x27;s dream<br /><br />Level 1:<br /><br />Friends with DiCaprio team. Thinks he is back to real world with the
new thought carried from his Godfather&#x27;s dream to Intermediate dream to
real world. Ready to implement the thought in this Level 1 real world.
He is not aware of the existence of any Level 0.<br /><br />Level 0:<br /><br />No relationship with Dicaprio team. Just Remembers about the new
thought as a part of the dream(s) he had. But he comes to know that he
Level 1 is just a dream but not real world .The new through is not from
a real world experience.<br /><br />(This is the transition i would like to question. The movie doesn&#x27;t
show what the subject was thinking when he is back to this level 0.
Everyone starts walking as if objective was achieved )<br /><br />what&#x27;s not convincing is: The subject thinks that he just had a dream
and the idea he had was part of just a dream. But not part of some
REALLY planned extraction from his Godfather, which means there is no
authenticity associated with the new thought he now has. But for the
Subject who lived in Level1, yes since it is real world to him he would
have followed the thought that is being implanted into him. But isn&#x27;t
the objective of Dicaprio team is to implant the idea with
authenticity, into the mind of subject in Level 0 ? The subject would
not follow the implanted idea in Level 0 because, he knows that the
idea belongs to Level 1 which he consciously knows is a dream, meaning
DiCaprio team&#x27;s objective is not met.<br /><br />Am i missing something?
