This movie has it all. A Sci-Fi world in subconscious dreams. A load of
special effects done with great care and technique. Even a love story
thrown in. Action packed and non stop pace keep this cerebral movie on
track. After watching this at home for the first time I was so blown
away I stood up and paced about the room rehashing with my family what
we had just seen.<br /><br />If you are not a fan of deep heady type films, pass. This movie takes
you to the edge of reality and snaps you back like a rubber band.<br /><br />Easily the best movie from Netflix since I joined in 2000.<br /><br />Peace.
