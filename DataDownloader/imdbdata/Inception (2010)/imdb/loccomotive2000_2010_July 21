Christopher Nolan returns with Inception, the definitive summer
blockbuster of the year that stands heads and shoulders above it&#x27;s
competition consisting of adaptations, remakes and sequels full of
mindless action. With this highly intellectual film, he has once again
challenged the average movie-goer by starting off with a mind-bogging
and profound concept of dreams and reality, with a spectacular heist
going under way, while we follow the emotional journey of the
protagonist. <br /><br />Inception tells the story of Dom Cobb, who is a skilled thief in the
art of Extraction; stealing the darkest secrets of a person through his
or her subconsciousness, or in other words, dreams. After becoming a
fugitive, he is offered a chance back into his old life, but only if he
can perform what is known to be impossible; the act of planting an idea
into someone&#x27;s mind, known as Inception. Cobb assembles a team as they
prepare for a mission into the mind so dangerous that may cost them the
ability to distinguish dreams from reality forever. <br /><br />DiCaprio is flawless here. As Cobb, he sparks off the presence of a
true expert in his field, but as the story digs deeper into him we see
a conflicted man haunted by his own obsessions. Leo&#x27;s star-studded co-
stars threatened to steal the show, with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tom
Hardy providing comic relief in an intriguing rivalry, and Ellen Page
as the enthusiastic student who is introduced to dream sharing for the
first time. <br /><br />All the tricks and trademarks of Nolan that we have come to know and
love are evident here, from the first scene that teases us of what&#x27;s to
come, to that last scene that will have us re-examine ourselves, and on
these message boards, possibly years of debate. Here, Nolan combines
some of the greatest aspects of his past films; from the puzzle-solving
quest in Memento to the brilliantly thought out heist plans and action
sequences in the Batman movies, while he masterfully unfolds the
secrets of Cobb one layer at a time. Visually he succeeds in capturing
the feel of dreams with scene cuts, incoherent objects and
physics-defying feats. However, with Nolan being a technical film
director more fond of practical methods, it leaves one thinking if this
film could have been more visually spectacular had there been more use
of CGI of the highest standards. <br /><br />On top of being one of the few original films out there with a bold and
exciting concept, Inception&#x27;s greatest triumph comes in it&#x27;s ability to
tease the audience with more questions raised than answers given
throughout the film. Even if Nolan himself denies it, there is no doubt
that Inception is toying with it&#x27;s audience, hinting at different takes
and theories to the film throughout. But that is exactly why we will
love this movie, for it sets us uncontrollably debating over the
ambiguities and paradoxes that perhaps will never have a definitive
answer, and question ourselves on the true meaning of the film. In an
era where the typical summer action film so often contains so little
depth, this is probably exactly what we need.
