I saw this movie today and I was all charged up because it was a Nolan
venture.. And Thank God I watched this movie on the big screen instead
of my PC.. simply because watching this movie at home would be an
insult to the gem that Christopher Nolan has created..The people who
would see this review would probably think that this guy is
exaggerating it, but trust me.. I AM NOT... People who are criticizing
this movie are just plain dumb..If I had it my way,anybody giving this
movie less than a 9/10 at the least wouldn&#x27;t have their review posted
here...This movie is worth all the acclaim and accolades that are being
showered on it..And if Leo DiCaprio doesn&#x27;t get an Oscar for this, then
I don&#x27;t know for what he will.. <br /><br />I would not want to spoil the fun by telling anything about the
plot...But just a message to Mr. Christopher Nolan - &#x22;Thank You for
respecting the viewer&#x27;s intelligence.&#x22;
