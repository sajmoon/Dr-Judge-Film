I doubt any film could have lived up to the hype surrounding this one.
I thought &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22; was about the best action film ever to hit
the screen, and &#x22;Memento&#x22; a clever puzzle that engaged.<br /><br />&#x22;Inception&#x22; has the look of a great film, but it&#x27;s about as
heavy-handed as any film I can think of. We&#x27;re constantly stopping to
hear a long explanation of the new rules of dream logic that got us
to...something that isn&#x27;t at all dream-like. And by the time we hit the
slope on skis it seemed so weighted down by mundane &#x22;action,&#x22; I lost
all interest.<br /><br />The first 30 minutes or so when you don&#x27;t have your footing on what&#x27;s
going on are the most satisfying. But once the explanations start (and
they never approach the cleverness of &#x22;Memento&#x22;) tedium sets in.<br /><br />Logic is abandoned: Who says that if you die in a dream you never wake
up? Why is one person&#x27;s projection lethal and another&#x27;s isn&#x27;t? How can
an &#x22;architect&#x22; of one person override another&#x27;s? On and on.... And
&#x22;just because&#x22; really isn&#x27;t a satisfying answer for a film that
purports to be a sensation.<br /><br />Visually, it can draw gasps. Intellectually, it&#x27;s just plain silly. And
the entire length works against any excitement. I&#x27;d have voted for one
less dream within a dream.<br /><br />There&#x27;s a 1962, 28 minute short film, &#x22;La Jet&#xE9;e&#x22; which is likely the
source for Nolan&#x27;s idea. It devastates the viewer with much less fuss
than all this $160 million dollar rattling and rolling.
