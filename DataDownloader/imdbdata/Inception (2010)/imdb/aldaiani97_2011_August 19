What thing that needs to do better than this. Dear Mr. Nolan, you can
not be a normal person. What can you do after this is what I tell you
that deified the largest and the biggest film project in history.
Nolan&#x27;s name from the names of the success in the modern film industry.
One of the finest qualities in Nolan is the script. You are waiting for
a train. Train will take you faraway. A dream within a dream I&#x27;m
impressed. 528491 oh There are a lot of ideas in this film. And Hans
Zimmer&#x27;s soundtrack was fantastic. Joseph. DiCaprio. Ellen. Maron. Ken.
Murphy. Hardy. Especially Hardy. They were all good in this film. Do
not forget the wonderful Cinematographer Wally Pfister He deserved the
Oscar. In the end, I tell you that we have seen a film. Wait. This is
not a movie. This is the invention of the century. <br /><br />This is Inception.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan Thank you and God bless you.
