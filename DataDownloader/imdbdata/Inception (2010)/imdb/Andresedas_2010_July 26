My high expectations of this movie based on its no. 3 position in the
Top 250 lasted for about 2 seconds into the movie. What a disgrace! And
so childish. And Tiring! How can it be that everyone likes this movie.
It&#x27;s absolutely overloaded with bizarre and completely arbitrary turns
of plot that have to be explained for about 75% of the movie. No
character! No excitement, I could not even tell who were the bad guys.
And yet again a few seconds of Michael Caine to camouflage the complete
cardboard appearance of the entire cast! What is the meaning of this
movie? What is it about? Uhhh???? Its internal logic is utter bullshit.
Its emotional significance is zero, empty, frightening.<br /><br />Can please somebody agree with me, I feel so sad.<br /><br />Kurosawa come alive!
