&#x22;Take, if you must, this little bag of dreams, Unloose the cord, and
they will wrap you round.&#x22; William Butler Yates <br /><br />&#x22;Ha, bloody ha!&#x22; Viewing this movie left me with wobbly legs, barely
able to walk the first few steps towards the door. My hands were
shaking and my head ached. What a rush! I haven&#x27;t had this reaction
since &#x22;Black Hawk Down&#x22;. Christopher Nolan has artfully taken the
images of our subconscious nocturnal ruminations and used them as
priceless fodder for his &#x22;Inception.&#x22; Not only was I completely drawn
in within the first few minutes, I felt involved. <br /><br />The notion of dreaming &#x27;in conference&#x22;, as well as in layers is
interesting and intelligent, but there are myriads of such ideas
bouncing around in the heads of creative sorts all over the place. The
fact the Nolan was able to gather the group of actors that he did and
then pull it off is extremely impressive. <br /><br />DiCaprio as Cobb the retired &#x27;architect&#x27; was, as usual, solid and
dependable. Even more, his haunted affect in respect to his
relationship with his wife, was chilling. Ellen Page, Ariadne, becomes
to Cobb a sort of &#x27;good angel&#x27; on one shoulder to Marion Cotillard&#x27;s
(Cobb&#x27;s wife), bad angel on the other. The insinuations of ambiguity
between reality and dream become a frightening proposition for Cobb,
and for those of us who witness. As supporting cast, Tom Hardy, Ken
Watenabe and Joseph Gordon-Levitt were icing on the cake, powerful and
proficient in their parts. What a surprise to see Gordon-Levitt used as
muscle! <br /><br />CGI was mind-bendingly claustrophobic in some scenes and eye candy for
the ADHD advantaged in others! I&#x27;m far too ignorant about such things
to comment beyond that. <br /><br />There have been some criticisms regarding character development and
confusion regarding the role of Kobel Engineering in the dream
sequences. As far as character development in concerned, when chaos
abounds, there is not much time to exchange personal information or go
fishing. This was an intense experience that I believe would have
suffered from too much exposition. As to Kobel Engineering, I believe
they were in Cobb&#x27;s surreality, as was Mal. <br /><br />&#x22;Inception&#x22; was the movie of 2010 for me. I plan to watch it at least a
couple more times in order to cull the marvelous minutia right out of
it.
