It is rumored that Christopher Nolan took eight years to complete this
story, his first original work in over a decade. Perhaps he just needed
a little more time.<br /><br />It doesn&#x27;t surprise me that Nolan, the guilty party behind Memento,
would come up with a movie where gratuitously Byzantine convolution is
served up instead of anything resembling story. What does surprise me
is that Nolan manages, eventually, to steer this vehicle to a
reasonably satisfying conclusion. And it is for the sake of the
marginally effective d&#xE9;nouement alone that I am willing to forgive a
movie for having a blatantly video game structure, complete with levels
and avatars and an artificially aggressive ticking clock to manufacture
urgency.<br /><br />I suppose one could carp about the fact that Ellen Page as Ariadne goes
from badly dressed student to the Yoda of shared dreaming quite
literally in the blink of an eye, but that would be complaining about
the table service when the restaurant is on fire. Perhaps the biggest
failing of the writing in Inception is that all the characters are
forced to deliver lengthy, tedious expository dialogue to explain what
just happened, what is currently happening, or what is about to happen. <br /><br />Without giving too much away, this probably explains why, in the second
act, Nolan has the wrong character delivering a speech. Basically,
there are the main characters in a dream and then there are projections
created by the characters. In one scene, a key plot element is
explained by a projection, who would have no knowledge of the element,
instead of the character, who is there to introduce it. It&#x27;s an
amateurish blunder that shows what happens when bad writers get in over
their heads.<br /><br />This basic story itself was done decades ago with far more finesse and
wit in everything from Dreamscape to American Werewolf in London. In
fact, the whole plot, if you can call it that, is as convincingly fresh
as yesterday&#x27;s dry toast. It&#x27;s The Matrix meets Eternal Sunshine of the
Spotless Mind, who then get hijacked by Total Recall while Memento and
Dark City stand back and laugh on the sidelines. It&#x27;s as if Nolan
wanted to outdo all of them by forcing them into a single mashed up
meta-story.<br /><br />So why watch this movie? I guess it all comes down to this &#x96; the movie,
quite simply, is fun to watch. Lots of fun.<br /><br />What Nolan lacks as a writer, and the list is long, he more than makes
up for as a director. Inception is taut and energetic from start to
finish. Even though the characters are ridiculously flat, they move
effortlessly through Nolan&#x27;s heightened reality. Inception may not be
the best story literarily, but Nolan&#x27;s way of telling it cinematically
is superb.<br /><br />In short, the story revolves around a team of people, scientist, spies,
we&#x27;re never really sure, who have perfected a way of entering other
people&#x27;s dreams. Once inside, they use the warped reality of dreams to
extract secrets from the dreamer.<br /><br />Apparently there are numerous rules regarding dream intervention.
Violating them leads to dire consequences. Mercifully, the old saw that
if you die in a dream you die in real life is not true here. It just
wakes you up. Usually.<br /><br />But along comes the mission to use the dream to implant an idea in the
dreamer &#x96; Inception. Apparently this is difficult, but, of course, it
must be done. Fortunately, it seems that the whole world is up on the
dream-jacking process, and experts abound. It&#x27;s even so commonplace
that ordinary citizens go to seminars on how to fight back in their
dreams, making them formidable foes in dreamland. So a new team is
assembled and the game, as in video game, is on, and on, and on.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that, in typical Nolan fashion, the story revolves
around itself until it generates a tasty little paradox, within which
the (almost) redeeming moments of the film reside. Ersatz intellectuals
are already asking the central question of the film as proof of their
depth, a sort of &#x22;Who is John Galt?&#x22; meta-meme. Unfortunately, Ayn Rand
was such a pedantic, didactic writer I ended up not caring who John
Galt was. In similar fashion, after Nolan has drummed away at his
central issue for so long it grew tedious, I walked away from this
movie not caring about the answer to &#x22;The Question.&#x22;<br /><br />I&#x27;d say, reel in your expectations a tad, then go see the movie and
have fun.
