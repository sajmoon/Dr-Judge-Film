Dreams within a dream, within a dream. Are dreams within dreams
actually dreams or nightmares? I find it difficult to remember my
dreams, sometimes I get the feeling that I&#x27;ve been there before but
perhaps in a dream. The movie &#x27;Inception&#x27; explores the subject of
dreams and the ability to influence people through their dreams:
inception. This ability to influence could have many uses. In the world
of business contracts could be won, persuasion of political agenda&#x27;s
can be achieved and in retail customers can be convinced that they
really need the item on offer even though in reality they don&#x27;t. In the
movie a team of agents lead by Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) infiltrate the
dreams of their targets. Their mission is to influence the son of a
dying oil tycoon in an effort to prevent future market dominance.
Tension is provided by the unstable mind of Cobb. The projections of
his dreams and desires threaten the mission. Cobb is on the edge and
working on his own agenda while other members of the team are kept in
the dark. To help the audience understand the thoughts and dreams of
the main protagonist Cobb, a young apprentice is drafted in to help the
team. Ariadne (Ellen Page) is young, attractive and has plenty of time
to spare from her studies to commit to helping with the mission. She is
a fast leaner and keen to learn more. There is no love interest in this
movie but Ariadne is drawn to Cobb and his mysterious character. She
advises Cobb on what he should and should not be doing; offering her
opinion on matters and saying how certain things should be done. She&#x27;s
an &#x27;upstart&#x27; looking to impress; she&#x27;s annoying but clever and probably
right. If I were dreaming I would tell her to go away or perhaps give
her a kiss. Ariadne uncovers for the audience the &#x27;truth&#x27; behind Cobb&#x27;s
dreams and what is motivating his character. The truth is not clear
despite Cobb&#x27;s explanation of past events. Owing to the dream
environment of the movie, questioning the truth is unavoidable. What is
a dream and what is a dream within a dream? Where is reality? Inception
is used to influence people such that their behaviour in the non-dream
world is manipulated by changing their subconscious thoughts, beliefs
and emotions directly from within their dreams. Given the ability to
create dreams with other dreams, the layers of differing and alternate
perceived reality or dreams is almost infinite. Much like the main
characters state of mind, the environment depicted in the movie is
unstable. As an audience there is no opportunity to feel comfortable
with the events of the movie. Our only comfort is that we understand
the danger of getting too comfortable. As the movie concludes so does
the dream; the inception is drawing to a close. The extent to which we
believe the inception will vary. The truth behind the events are
coloured by the various levels of dreams. Our dream is now over and as
we awake we are left to question the central characters true
motivation. Inception is the perfect way to mislead or persuade. The
next time you&#x27;re arguing with your partner about which colour carpets
would suit the hall and stairs, perhaps there is a better way to
convince them that you are right.
