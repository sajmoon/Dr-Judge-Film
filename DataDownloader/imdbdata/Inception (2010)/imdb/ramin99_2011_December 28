I don&#x27;t know what I was watching and I didn&#x27;t care. This Matrix rip-off
is very implausible and the science behind it will never be invented.
In the old times this plot would be made into a B-movie. Nowadays big
money is allocated because we all want to see some impossible thing
that is cool to look at.<br /><br />In my dreams I run fast but don&#x27;t go anywhere; or I shoot a guy 20
times and he laughs in my face. My cousin repeatedly appears in my
dreams and if I ever find him sleeping in the next room and inserting
himself in my dreams I&#x27;ll kick his ass.<br /><br />2/10 for the Germans for their sharp Carl Zeiss lenses. I better go
have a real dream, that&#x27;s 8 hours of my life that feels like 5 minutes.
Good night folks and please rate my dream 9/10, for its* more real.<br /><br />*I deliberately typed &#x22;its&#x22; instead of &#x22;it&#x27;s,&#x22; because this is the
vogue on the net.
