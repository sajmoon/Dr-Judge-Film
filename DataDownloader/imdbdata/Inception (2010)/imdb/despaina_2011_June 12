I don&#x27;t rate many films as a 10, but this one would be one of them.<br /><br />The reason I rate this so highly, is because it appeals on the
emotional level and the action level. Not many movies can do that, and
yet be so fulfilling. The score, the screenplay, and the special
effects add tremendously to an already beautiful story.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan presents such a unique view into the world unseen
that we experience every night and in the back of our minds everyday.<br /><br />After seeing it again, it completely entertains me. It&#x27;s flattering
because it asks you to &#x22;take a leap of faith&#x22; and trust it. It also
compliments the audience by acknowledging we see another layer of life
beneath our everyday reality.<br /><br />Just as real, just as tangible, and just as important.
