...And I&#x27;m not one of those Nolan/Dark Knight-fan-boys. This really
deserves every praise it&#x27;s getting. One of the most anticipated films
of the year, Inception, is nothing short of spectacular. When reviews
were pouring in, critics were honoring it as one of the best films of
the year. My anticipation level was through the roof, and while I had
my doubts, it succeeded every expectation I had. <br /><br />I don&#x27;t even know where to begin, everything about this film is worthy
of Oscar consideration. The script written by Christopher Nolan is one
of the most brilliant pieces of art ever written. It&#x27;s so intelligent,
thought-provoking, and completely original. I like to think that I can
call myself &#x22;a writer,&#x22; but after seeing Inception, no person compares
to Christopher Nolan&#x27;s writing here. <br /><br />Christopher Nolan also directs the film with such confidence. Many
think he was snubbed in 2008 for a Best Director nomination, if he&#x27;s
snubbed again this year (which I highly doubt), the Academy will have
some explaining to do. He takes this material that was masterfully
written and turns it into his remarkable vision. This is a film where
so much depended on the director, and he thankfully held up his end of
the deal and more. <br /><br />This would be a terrifying adventure for someone who doesn&#x27;t pay
attention to a film always. When you view the film, pretend as if there
was a quiz afterward, otherwise it&#x27;s easy to get lost. Nolan moves at
the right pace for this film, he just asks you to meet him half-way,
which a director should ask of you. You are connected more to the film
that way. <br /><br />The performances are also wonderful. It&#x27;s one of the best, if not the
best, ensembles of the year. I got the feeling every cast member came
to the set with the material in their hands ready to attack it.
Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the most talented actors working today and
he fits Cobb to a tee. Pitching the right emotion at the right time
every time. Marion Cotillard, who is always the stand-out in her films
since she started starring in American films, follows the tradition
here. Her character wasn&#x27;t at all what I expected her to be. She&#x27;s the
villain figure and with that delivers a hauntingly luminous portrait of
Mal (which translates to &#x22;Evil&#x22; in Latin, thank you Peter Travers).
She&#x27;s heart-breaking, frightening, and even charming, all in the matter
of about a 20 minute performance. Ellen Page is effective as the brainy
and curious girl who tries to follow in Cobb&#x27;s footsteps. LeVitt gets a
laugh here and there as much as he does with the dramatic scenes.
Murphy steers with subtly of the brutality of being taking advantage of
shortly after the death of his father.<br /><br />Inception is much of a stimulation on the narrative side as it is on
the technical side. The cinematography is gorgeous. The lingering sets
will impress you. Heck, even the costumes match the characters well,
some are even beautiful for being a contemporary piece, Mal&#x27;s costumes
in particular. The special effects may seem a cross with The Matrix and
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, but Inception stands as it&#x27;s own
in originality.<br /><br />With that being said, Christopher Nolan does something here some
directors never get close to in their entire career, delivers a
near-perfect film. Inception is more than a summer blockbuster and
science fiction/ action film the trailers may imply. It&#x27;s a must see; a
solid 10.
