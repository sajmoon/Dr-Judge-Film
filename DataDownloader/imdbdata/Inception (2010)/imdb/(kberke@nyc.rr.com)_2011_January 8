In Inception, Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, Memento), who directs
and writes the film, asks the question, &#x22;Are we living in a dream world
or is it real? And which is more desirable?&#x22; The viewer can answer for
himself as Inception plunges him into both worlds. The arena of
Inception, a system containing the wild creations of its dreamers,
grows more vivid, thrilling and tangible as the movie unfolds.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio plays Cobb, an expert extracter, someone who is able
to enter the dream state of another in order to steal confidential
information from their subconscious. He works mainly corporate
espionage, until one of his targets, Saito (Ken Watanbe) hires him to
do an inception. Instead of stealing another&#x27;s ideas, he is to implant
one.<br /><br />Cobb knows the power of ideas. In one of the opening scenes, he states
that ideas are the most powerful invaders of humankind, impossible to
forget and capable of growing. DiCaprio is utterly convincing as the
master dreamer and leader, the one who has the power to guide the
others through the maze of their dream states and get out safely. This
is not an easy sell because Nolan is asking us to suspend our belief
about how we comprehend reality.<br /><br />The dangers of inception are clear. There isn&#x27;t just one level. To
implant the idea, his team must go 3 levels down, to a dream within a
dream within a dream, comprehending and dodging the obstacles of their
target, Fischer, played by Cillian Murphy.<br /><br />Nolan visualizes this world powerfully. It becomes increasingly harder
to distinguish the dream world from the waking world. People are in
danger. Revolutionaries, security forces and armies hunt them down.
Ellen Page as the architect, Ariadne, conjures up an entire
cathedral-like structure on top of existing buildings through which she
and Cobb roam freely, breaking the laws of physics. It&#x27;s like an M.C.
Escher drawing.<br /><br />Our willing suspension of belief is referred back to during the
climactic scenes, where the team tries to guide Fisher through the
deepest level of dream state so he can discover the implanted idea
himself. Nolan cuts between Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Arthur, Cobb&#x27;s
right hand man and a sober, level headed influence, as he battles
Fischer&#x27;s security forces in zero gravity while the rest of the team
squares off on snow-capped mountains dodging an avalanche while
battling gun-toting adversaries. In &#x22;real time&#x22; the dreamers are packed
in a van plunging off a bridge into slow motion.<br /><br />Cobb is tormented by a secret sorrow. He cannot prevent his wife from
entering his dream states and destroying his plans. Ariadne acts as the
outsider, the one who questions Cobb&#x27;s obsession and tries to protect
him and the group against it.<br /><br />The cast is uniformly excellent, with Tom Hardy playing Eames, the
wise-cracking master of disguise and Dileep Rao as Yusuf, the chemist
charged with jolting the team from their self-induced comas and driving
the van plunging off the bridge. But Christopher Nolan is the master,
creating enrapturing scenes that make you pause as you try to answer
the question I posed at the start of this review.
