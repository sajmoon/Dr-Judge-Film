I have been waiting like many to see this film. And I wish to see it
again, preferably in an empty cinema because you just don&#x27;t want to
lose any piece of it. The film demands your full attention from the
beginning but once you&#x27;re accustomed to it you get blown away by the
story, the visuals, the actors and locations but above all; the idea.
The impossible becomes possible in this film and it&#x27;s all made &#x22;real&#x22;
and with purpose and meaning.<br /><br />If you liked The Dark Knight and The Matrix, you have to see this one,
it will be the best spent money on a ticket since The Dark Knight.<br /><br />The only thing that doesn&#x27;t make it a 10/10 for me is the fact that
it&#x27;s strongest point is also it&#x27;s weakest, bending reality has it&#x27;s
limits and Nolan carefully avoids those limits. What&#x27;s real and what&#x27;s
not can get tiring. Good thing the effects are convincing as well.<br /><br />It&#x27;s the concept and how well it is realized, filmed, that&#x27;s brilliant,
however, telling you about it is never gonna portray the experience.
Pure cinema is scarce these days. This is the opportunity to get it.
