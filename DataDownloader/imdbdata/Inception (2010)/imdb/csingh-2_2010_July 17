The concept is intriguing, the direction is slick and the plot is
gripping. This would adequately describe any Christopher Nolan film, be
it Memento, Prestige or The Dark Knight. Inception is no exception.
Nolan once again manages to stun and intrigue his audience with a
roller coaster ride that dares to challenge your perceptive
capabilities. <br /><br />It is definitely not one of the simplest plots to understand &#x96;
Technology exists to infiltrate your mind and allow other people to be
a part of your dream, of course unwillingly. Simple enough? Not really.
In a world where such technology does exist, there forms a thin line
between a dream and reality. It is easy to get lost in this &#x27;multi
layer&#x27; film where the limits of the familiar concept of &#x27;dreams&#x27; are
tested. But the film promises to glue you to your seats and your eyes
to the screen all throughout the 148 minutes. <br /><br />Cobb (DiCaprio) is an expert at dream invasion and gets paid to find
out peoples&#x27; secrets by accessing their dreams and conning the secret
out of them. Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Ariadne (Ellen Page), Eams
(Tom Hardy) and Yusuf (Dileep Rao) are his accomplices in the &#x27;not
strictly speaking, &#x22;legal&#x22;&#x27;, task. They are hired by one of their own
victims, Saito (Ken Watanabe), to perform the impossible &#x96; Inception,
that is, deliberately planting an idea in someone&#x27;s head during the
dream invasion so as to make the person think that it is their own. It
will make more sense during the movie. <br /><br />Like any other Christopher Nolan movie, this one too has brilliant
dialogues and flawless performances. DiCaprio once again proves his
merit as one of the best actors in the business and Ellen Page and
Joseph Gordon-Levitt don&#x27;t disappoint either. German composer Hans
Zimmer continues to provide some thrilling music as he did previously
in The Dark Knight.<br /><br />It would be foolish not to expect any twists and turns in this highly
entertaining yet complex tale which explores the limits of the human
subconscious. The beauty of the film is that despite the intricacy of
the set up, the audience finds itself identifying with many of the
concepts intimately linked with the plot. The notion of dreams within
dreams and retardation of time while dreaming is something all of us
may have experienced. Even the feeling of free falling during sleep or
the &#x27;kick&#x27; that wakes us up is cleverly used and deftly executed. All
in all, the movie is technically brilliant, mentally stimulating,
visually mesmerizing and conceptually fascinating. Watch it because a
movie like this comes once in a decade.
