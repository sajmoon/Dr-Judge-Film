Inception is the 2 and a half hour thriller by acclaimed director
Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight) that has been at the top of the box
office for almost a month... with good reason.<br /><br />The plot, of course, is 100% fiction. People are capable of sharing
dreams with each other and stealing secrets from the minds of other
dreamers... on, like the plot of the movie, forcing things into the
minds of other dreamers. Leonardo Dicaprio (who ALWAYS chooses the
right movies) is very good in this, as is Ellen Page and the other
actors/actresses). And if you have ever thought about how movies almost
NEVER show a dream the way it should be, then you will be pleased with
this film. There are many trippy events that occur, such as a &#x22;kick&#x22;
(the &#x22;falling feeling&#x22;), which wakes you up from your dream
immediately. The ending to film... I don&#x27;t think I can say anything
without giving the film away so I wont tell you about it.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t want to give away the plot at all, but it&#x27;s deep, amazing, and
full of state-of-the-art special effects. In my opinion it&#x27;s the most
creative film since the matrix.
