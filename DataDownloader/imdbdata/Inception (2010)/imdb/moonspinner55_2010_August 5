Writer-director Christopher Nolan&#x27;s byzantine puzzle-movie &#x22;Inception&#x22;
is so fully engulfed in a surreal sort of Raison d&#x27;&#xEA;tre--while also
managing to introduce a new set of rules to us, though not appearing to
abide by those rules near the finale--it&#x27;s easy to understand why some
audiences are embracing the film as a masterpiece. These days, if a
film is complexly-layered it is automatically deemed art...not popcorn
entertainment ready for mass consumption, but high art. If &#x22;small
minds&#x22; are unable to grasp the film&#x27;s deeper meanings, those poor folks
are disregarded as unworthy participants in the ultimate game.
&#x22;Inception&#x22; is a game--and, at times, a grand one--but it isn&#x27;t a
masterpiece. It&#x27;s a gun-crazy, gadget-mad, hyperactive Rubik&#x27;s Cube of
a movie. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the grieving Cobb, a dream extractor
who enters into the sleeping minds of others to gather vital
information which cannot be obtained any other way. Unfortunately,
memories of his late wife (and guilt over her mysterious death) are so
vivid they are permeating Cobb&#x27;s subconscious; and inevitably those
haunted images follow him helplessly on his jaunts into the
dream-state. The movie has very little exposition, with a confusing
prologue later revealed to be the starter threads to the epilogue, and
doesn&#x27;t really get going until we are introduced to Cobb&#x27;s latest case
involving a dying billionaire, his crestfallen son, and the final draft
of the tycoon&#x27;s will which is locked up in a safe no one knows the
combination to. The other participants in the project are a brainy,
adept, and engaging group of people we become quite fond of; often
times, particularly in a perplexing movie such as this one, having such
smart, savvy characters populating the scenario makes the ride that
much more enjoyable (not forgetting of course that humans are never so
vulnerable to danger as when they are asleep). What doesn&#x27;t really work
are the constant sniper attacks in the dreams--projections which
manifest themselves as an angry militia--as well as a visual
impersonation of the son&#x27;s godfather, which is necessary to the plot
but becomes little more than a complicated footnote. The level of
dreams our heroes pass through, one more dangerous than the last,
provide the picture with a visual kick, and the nonchalant manner in
which the characters respond to their strange new surroundings accent
&#x22;Inception&#x22; with a giddiness not usually found in big-budget action
films. I&#x27;m not sure whether or not Christopher Nolan violates his own
movie-rules in order to cap the film with an emotional bow, but he does
get solid performances from his cast, a rich and delectable production
design from his art department, and swirling, hallucinogenic special
effects from his creative team. Is the movie a mind-blowing experience?
For many audiences, it certainly will be. As with all &#x27;summer epics&#x27;
and popcorn crowd-pleasers, this one&#x27;s crazy glow will probably fade in
the stretch (I can&#x27;t imagine the film will hold up so well once it goes
the home-video route--it&#x27;s a theatrical experience, after all). It is
not a work of art, however that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t sheer pleasure
from start to finish. *** from ****
