2010_August 5 
I&#x27;ve seen this movie in a very crowded theatre in Brighton 2 weeks ago
and I enjoyed it very much. When I got home I wrote a review (in my
native language, which is Italian) and I added myself to the list of
those who actually think that this is a great movie if you like movies
because they are a form of entertainment, and not a way to show off how
witty/smart/cunning/opinionated you are criticizing someone else&#x27;s
work. The horrid thing about Inception is that it&#x27;s making those who
didn&#x27;t like it call those who actually enjoyed it
&#x22;dumb/stupid/ignorant/etc&#x22;. I think that&#x27;s really messed up and clear
sign that they need to let go of their frustration and stop going to
the movies with the attitude of &#x22;if this flick turns out to be crap I&#x27;m
going to write on IMDb that everybody who likes it is a retard&#x22;. Not
healthy. Inception has top notch CGI, a good cast, an interesting plot
(in a genre that pretty much has explored every corner of the universe
of possibilities), an approach to sci-fi that&#x27;s unusual, brilliant
soundtrack, a good ending (and that&#x27;s what most of the people who
didn&#x27;t like it have in common: they didn&#x27;t bother to watch the end...)
and serves very well the purpose of taking you away from your every-day
reality for a couple of hours. I don&#x27;t see why should I be called dumb
because I enjoy all of that. And trying to argue that it is a &#x22;movie
for dumb people&#x22; because the &#x22;concept of the dream machine is blah blah
blah&#x22; is the most useless attempt to look smart I have ever seen...
