Like many others I cannot see this as a work of genius at all and
believe this to be a really stupid movie.<br /><br />The dream team that can manipulate your dreams and waking ideas - Yeah
Right - &#x27;in your dreams&#x27;. That about sums it all up.<br /><br />The movie writes it&#x27;s own rule book regarding dreams and assumes that
time moves exponentially more slowly when you dream within dreams.
There is no evidence for this as fact and my experience and
understanding is that dreams can go both ways - sometimes an epic takes
minutes and others an action takes hours.<br /><br />So having said that the whole conceptual context falls apart and
crumbles into absurdity. And why would movement in a dream affect a
dream within a dream as occurs in this movie? When you dream you leave
the real world behind - until you awaken.<br /><br />This movie has been compared with the Matrix trilogy. Well it blatantly
rips it off but that&#x27;s another dream - or rather a fantasy. This movie
doesn&#x27;t even come close to Matrix which was truly original and at a
stretch even plausible. This isn&#x27;t.
