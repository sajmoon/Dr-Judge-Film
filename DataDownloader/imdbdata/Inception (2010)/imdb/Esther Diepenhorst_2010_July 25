Even though Inception for me didn&#x27;t match The Dark Knight it is still
one of the best movies that I have ever seen. In fact it is one of
those movies that you want to see again after a first time to try and
figure out what goes where.<br /><br />The movie is complicated, there is more going on than meets the eye. As
a first timer you see this film one way and when you are done and
finally start connecting dots about what was really happening or at
least what could have been happening you feel like seeing it again to
get some form of confirmation. It is a great movie if you, like me, are
into making theories, finding reasons etc.<br /><br />I didn&#x27;t find any dull moments in this movie, the acting was simply
fantastic as well as the whole vibe. The writing is simply amazing and
complex, I tip my hat to you Nolan for this one.<br /><br />I first thought the trailers explained almost every thing of this movie
but that is not true, unexpected things still happened which made
everything different than what it seemed. You think it is about one
thing when something else is actually going on.<br /><br />The scenes, effects and designs are simply amazing. To me this is the
movie of the year and I highly recommend people to see it.
