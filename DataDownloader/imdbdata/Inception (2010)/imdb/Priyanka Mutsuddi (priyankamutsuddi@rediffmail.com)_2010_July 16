I loved it. OK, I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and I love dark
movies with great twists. I loved Memento..Prestige, I had to watch it
twice to understand it.<br /><br />I have seen dreams inside dreams inside dreams, so I got the movie from
the moment it started. I will not spoil it too much but everything in
the movie are explained clearly. The mystery of the movie is inside the
mind of Cobb. He is hiding his subconscious guilt and still playing the
game of inception with his team members. This is the most difficult job
he has to do and all the time he is haunted by his wife. The movie is
understandable. Leonardo Dicaprio&#x27;s one of the best performance after
The Blood Diamond. Ellen Page is absolutely the character Nolan wanted
from her. She is a brilliant architect and also curious about all the
mysteries that goes around Cobb&#x27;s life. This is the first movie I have
seen of Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I loved his character, balanced and funny
sometimes. This is the first movie of this summer that I am going to
watch a second time and may be third.
