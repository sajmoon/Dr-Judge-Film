I had the privilege of seeing this movie before it came out, and, like
most of DiCaprio&#x27;s films, it blew me away.<br /><br />Inception is a well-made movie, filmed in about 6 locations all over
the world. The directing was outstanding, there were only about two
moments, maybe three seconds in total, where i noticed that visual
effects were being used (of course defying gravity is pretty
difficult). <br /><br />The plot was very pleasingly intricate, with a twist-and-turn,
keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type feel. I noticed that this film
had similarities with DiCaprios thriller Shutter Island (which i also
enjoyed very much)seeing as it left you wondering what was real and
what was not. It&#x27;s great to see a movie with a thick and emotional plot
and not just grenade-throwing action heroes who achieve greatness in
the end.<br /><br />Inception also has a very well-composed score, which to me was the
finishing touch to a perfect movie. If you&#x27;re thinking about seeing
Inception, definitely go! Even though i was fortunate enough to see a
free show, it is worth every penny you pay. <br /><br />Truly unique, like nothing i&#x27;ve ever seen before. Christopher Nolan
certainly covered new ground with this film and wasn&#x27;t afraid to leave
us hanging with a spectacular ending.
