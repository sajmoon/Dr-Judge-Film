Christopher Nolan&#x27;s Inception is fast, witty, beautiful, action-packed
and emotional. But what makes this movie more special is the fact that
you are in a dream and you can do anything in a dream... There came
many astounding moments in the movie when I was very sure that the
movie will fail and lose it&#x27;s track, but it never does. Inception is a
rare combination of art and entertainment. It is extremely rich in both
the elements. I will blindly recommend this to anyone. If you compare
this to movies like Silence of the Lambs, Lord of the Rings, Pan&#x27;s
Labyrinth or Godfather, Inception proves to have better thrills and
stuns. It is the only movie in my opinion where possibilities of
winning are very thin and you are almost convinced that we are not
gonna make it. And the ending... wow that&#x27;s the best I have ever seen
in any movie and that&#x27;s the best part! Wally Pfister&#x27;s cinematography
and Han&#x27;s Zimmer&#x27;s electronic score makes Inception feel like
Inception. Go...Give it a try!
