2010_August 5 
I rarely post but felt the need after seeing the rave reviews on this
film that I clearly disagree with. I felt obligated to vote to bring
this score down to reality. I&#x27;ve read the terms benchmark, intelligent,
masterpiece and greatest ever. After seeing the movie I find those
terms and the current rating of 9.2 insulting. Yes for some reason I
feel personally insulted by this. Is this because I was expecting the
world after the great reviews and was truly disappointed? Was it the
fact that I believe most feel the movie wasn&#x27;t that great but are
jumping on the bandwagon? I&#x27;m not the most intelligent individual in
the world and can&#x27;t understand how anyone intelligent could actually
enjoy the story line with so many obvious holes. All I know is these
layers upon layers of poor plots left a sour feeling in my mouth. I&#x27;ve
read the comment and agree this is &#x27;a smart movie for ignorant people&#x27;.
They do say ignorance is bliss. Keep rating this ten you smart folk.<br /><br />Overrated, unengaging and far too long (let me scream that from the
roof tops) are my thoughts. I paid top dollar to view this in my lovely
electric reclining leather chair being waited on hand a foot in a &#x27;gold
class&#x27; cinema and I wanted to escape the comfort of my chair after 30
minutes. Long and painful movie experience. I urge you to filter
through the positive reviews and read some well articulated negative
responses. I have chose to keep this post short and sweet and leave the
well articulated responses to the well articulated (lord knows every
second person here thinks they are a literary genius). I really did
want to post a 1 out of 10. I am a realist though and I have seen worse
films. On a positive note Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy and Joseph
Gordon-Levitt were great. They boosted my score from a one to a three.
Leo and Joseph finally went through went through puberty and were
believable as adults. Give me back the 148 minutes of my life wasted
watching this film.
