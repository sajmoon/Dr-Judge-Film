INCEPTION The dialogue in this film is preoccupied with explaining what
is happening, rather than being natural. This is very possibly due to
the director feeling the concept of the film was too complicated for
mere cinema goers to comprehend and instead of enhancing the film as a
good flowing natural dialogue might it in fact has a tendency to spoil
the film. It is also very repetitive, continually repeating the rules
of inception, the inner workings of the dream construction. It becomes
very annoying and I&#x27;m sure Inception holds the world record for saying
the word &#x27;dream&#x27; more times than any other.<br /><br />There is a concept in teaching, developed by the Americans which goes
like this, tell the people what you are going to teach them, then teach
it to them, then tell them what is was you just taught them. It seems
the director has adopted this method of explaining to the audience,
just in case they are too stupid to get it for themselves, what the
film is about and what is happening.<br /><br />Di Caprio who in my opinion is a talented actor that often picks
challenging roles was neither commanding nor outstanding. Partly due to
the lack of any real structure to the film as the whole thing seemed
too fluid and poured out in a tsunami of CGI. Additionally there is no
kind of character development, something Di Caprio is generally
masterful at, leaving the film feeling hollow and a waste of an
otherwise talented cast. Something Hollywood studios will often do when
trying to portray highly intelligent criminals (or evil masterminds) is
cast British actors, and it is noticeable in Inception that director
Christopher Nolan has not broken away from the stereotype.<br /><br />A previous reviewer wrote &#x22;The stupid dialog is there, because Nolan
did not know, how to push the plot forward in an integrated way&#x22; and i
totally agree.<br /><br />I&#x27;ve heard a lot about how Inception is the new Matrix and I must
confess I have never watched Matrix, I did sit down and try, on three
occasions to do so, but all three times i fell asleep out of sheer
boredom. That is not sarcasm it is real. I know the Matrix story as
it&#x27;s so well known, whether or not Inception is the new Matrix i cannot
say but I can confess it&#x27;s a fairly redundant mediocre film with an
over contrived plot strung together by clich&#xE9; action scenes. The plot
concept is not so difficult to comprehend and seems to be hyped up for
what it really is. The only real thought needed is that of the closing
shot, (this is not a spoiler ).. does it tip or does it keep spinning?
I smell a sequel.<br /><br />3/10
