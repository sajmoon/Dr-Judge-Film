OK, this is surely not the third greatest movie ever as the statistics
on here indicate so far. I&#x27;m an avid movie buff who watches every
detail of a movie like a rabbit in heat watches female rabbits. It is a
good movie and I will be thinking about it for a while, but not as long
as I thought about Memento. Christopher Nolen is a genius of some kind
I admit. Anyone who can write like he does certainly is. I do some
writing myself and I am envious. I can&#x27;t point out any specific flaws
in the movie other than the obvious, &#x22;some of the concepts just would
not work in reality.&#x22; The acting was good and the story was intriguing
as can be. CGI I could care less about, as it does not make a great
movie. I am leery of the voters on here as there seems to be no real
reason they are voting for what they vote on (come on, The Shawshank
Redemtion is picked as the best movie of all time, that&#x27;s laughable). I
do recommend seeing this movie, but if you are a movie buff for real I
also recommend going back in time and seeing some well rated older
moves from directors such as Scorsese, Bergman, Coppola, Spielberg and
Aronofsky. You will definitely see this is not the 3rd best movie of
all time. There is too much emphasis put on votes from a younger crowd
who simply like weird stuff as opposed to intelligent all around film
making combined with excellent acting.
