Smart, fun, thrilling, and provokes you to think. I have seen the
social network and the kings speech. Both movies are great, but neither
are as original as this. I recommend this movie for anyone. So many
people have said its too confusing, but its really not. If you are
accustomed to mindless movies then it might be. I think that
Christopher Nolan is a visionary. He is a great director. For some
strange reason, the Academy has a tendency to ignore him. His work on
inception was amazing. What does he have to do to get a nomination?.
There is a great ensemble of a cast. Joseph Gordan-Levitt has a great
performance. Inception is the movie to see, and is Christopher Nolan&#x27;s
best movie yet. Inception gets 10 of 10 and is the greatest movie of
2010. Read full review here.
