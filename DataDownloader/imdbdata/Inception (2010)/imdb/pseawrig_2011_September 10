Okay, maybe this movie isn&#x27;t awful. It&#x27;s closer to mediocre, but I just
can&#x27;t resist the urge to lower its over-inflated rating.<br /><br />To be fair, Inception has a strong cast, inventive CGI, and an
interesting premise. Nonetheless, the film ends up being surprisingly
tedious and unaffecting. Images rush across the screen as jargon-rich
dialogue whisks pasts your ears. The film&#x27;s methodical score swells and
swells until you can barely make out what the characters are saying.
It&#x27;s all so complex, but complex like a brainteaser or a riddle. If you
concentrate very hard, you can decode the film&#x27;s narrative trick of
dreams within dreams within dreams within, well you get the idea, and
multiple action sequences all taking place at once in parallel
dreamscapes.<br /><br />But, what do you get for all of your narrative attention? Very little.
The story is gimmicky and the characters are flat: you just don&#x27;t care
what happens to them. In fact, when watching this film, I did not feel
as if I were watching characters navigate a story world. Instead, I
felt like I was watching movie stars speak difficult dialogue while
performing stunts.<br /><br />By the way, any movie that can make Joseph Gordon-Levitt seem less than
fascinating must have something wrong with it. If you do not believe
me, then watch Manic, Mysterious Skin, or The Lookout. Then marvel at
Inception&#x27;s ability to mask&#x97; or at the very least waste&#x97; his
considerable talent.<br /><br />As for the movie&#x27;s imagery, it is initially striking. Then, like the
movies narrative trope&#x97; a dream within a dream within a dream&#x97; it
becomes simply repetitious. Whose dreams look so leaden and dull? And
whose dreams are so relentlessly consistent and coherent? There are so
many good movies that replicate the bizarre visual logic of dreams--
Vertigo, Badlands, The Last Wave, Videodrome, Blue Velvet, Until the
End of the World. Has director Christopher Nolan ever seen any of these
movies? Has he ever even had a dream? <br /><br />In short, Inception delivers some new cinematic tricks, but lacks
emotional depth or provocative imagery. It&#x27;s a notch above Hollywood&#x27;s
typical comic book based summer extravaganza, but only a notch.
