2010_October 30 
Just saw an &#x27;Inception&#x27; today finally, although my hype for this movie
wasn&#x27;t that big at this point in time (it was much bigger few months
ago when it made top 10 movies of all time list here on IMDb basically
the first week it came to cinemas), I was still happy to see this movie
as I loved Nolan&#x27;s &#x27;Memento&#x27; and there were quite a few people pushing
this movie way past the mark that &#x27;Memento&#x27; set.<br /><br />Well two and half hours later I seem to be (judging by ratings) one of
the few that took a &#x22;free fall&#x22;... or wait... maybe I am one of the few
that took a &#x22;leap of faith&#x22;? (dum-dee-dum-dee-dum-dum) Roll the subtle
drummy music throughout my whole review please, cause I&#x27;m writing a
masterpiece here guys, I&#x27;m &#x22;cereal&#x22;! No, c&#x27;mon seriously all kidding
aside this movie isn&#x27;t top 10 material for anyone who is somewhat
experienced and realistic viewer that isn&#x27;t about to take an &#x22;Inception
101&#x22; class in local college to study this whole averagely done vague
script that only poses this much questions due to the core of the story
that is meant to do exactly that. Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, if a movie
gets under my skin and if the movie is great and exceptionally
well-done in terms of acting, script and cinematography, either one of
those things would actually make me do some &#x22;research&#x22; because then it
would be fun and I would think that conclusions would satisfy me
because of the quality of the questions. &#x27;Inception&#x27; doesn&#x27;t have
quality questions to ask the viewers, well I guess by flooded &#x22;FAQ&#x22;
threads that these viewers don&#x27;t need much quality questions presented
in the movie to make 100 of their own for every sequence. The answer
you&#x27;re looking for is only as worthy as the question that the movie
presented, that&#x27;s my main motto for these kind of &#x22;mystery after
viewing&#x22; movies. In fact, the first movie that popped into my mind out
of my subconscious (oh gawd now I am an &#x22;insheeped inceptic&#x22;!) was
&#x27;Primer&#x27;, a movie that I saw not so long ago about time-traveling
filled with questions and ridiculously messed up time-line, now that
movie I thought was worthy of watching again, kind of (gave it a 7).
Now, about those questions and &#x22;alternative&#x22; scenarios that &#x27;Inception&#x27;
seems to pose constantly with each scene to some viewers, when are you
people going to realize that that&#x27;s basically what this mediocre script
was designed for. If a 12 year old girl was writing it and used Justin
Bieber in a scene people would ask &#x22;Is Arthur really Justin Bieber
caught in a &#x22;limbo&#x22; and does Leonardo DiCaprio even exist?!&#x22; Or if
someone would let unknown strangers and home pets wander on the movie
set while the movie was being shot, people would ask questions about
that, basically what I&#x27;m trying to say is that all you have to do is
create a dream inside a dream that&#x27;s inside someone else&#x27;s dream who is
in a &#x22;limbo&#x22; of another person&#x27;s dream that is dead inside of his own
dream but can&#x27;t wake up due to another person&#x27;s late response to
&#x22;synchronized kick&#x22; (which was to me funniest aspect of this whole
script to be honest) and you&#x27;re good to go! Write whatever you want
after that people will embrace it and love it, oh but don&#x27;t forget to
make an actually good movie first that will then open a door for you to
make 2 big budgeted movies of a superhero saga that has already been
made 10 years earlier but who cares right, box-office blossoms etc.,
and then you&#x27;re well on your way to make something like &#x27;Inception&#x27;.
Why am I thrashing this like I gave it a 1/10 like the much smaller
group of hype-controlled biased people, I gave this movie a respectable
6/10, but uh-oh it&#x27;s #4 and that speaks volumes why I decided to do so.<br /><br />Now, on to a part where I actually tell you why this movie was &#x22;good&#x22;
enough for 6/10 for me. Leonardo DiCaprio was great again, this time as
Cobb the &#x22;dream extractor&#x22;, other people either seemed out of place (so
called miscasts), which are Ken Watanabe and Tom Berenger, and some
just seemed like token characters rather belonging to a Disney movie,
Dileep Rao definitely and Ellen Page (whom I loved in &#x27;Hard Candy&#x27; and
&#x27;Whip It&#x27; but not here unfortunately). Cinematography was quite decent
as movie was heavily budgeted, but visual effects never impress me
unless they&#x27;re a part of a great script or if they&#x27;re really
revolutionary and these weren&#x27;t. Music was good in second half of the
movie while in first half it was lacking. Action scenes are
unfortunately lame to me, Nolan tried to make it as original as he
could but for me it didn&#x27;t work out at all, plus action scenes of dream
extractors vs. projections were silly to begin with... the way they
were being played and the way they were being portrayed was just
ridiculous, unrealistic to the bone, but hey it&#x27;s a dream, might as
well put a tall fat Chinese guy with red hair in it and people would
still call it masterpiece.<br /><br />If you wanna watch a mysterious movie that will require multiple
viewings which you can research later on go see &#x27;Primer&#x27;. If you wanna
watch a movie that presents great and revolutionary visual effects
(although a much more shallow script) go watch &#x27;Avatar&#x27;. And finally if
you like Leonardo DiCaprio and you wanna watch him in center of
mysterious happenings that make him wonder what&#x27;s real and what&#x27;s fake,
go see a much more suspenseful and overall quality movie (to me),
&#x27;Shutter Island&#x27;.
