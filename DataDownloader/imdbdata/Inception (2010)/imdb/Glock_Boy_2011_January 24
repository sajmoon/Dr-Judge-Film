Alright folks, I saw the same movie you saw. My wife and I both went
into this with great expectations. Visually, the movie was interesting.
Beyond that, it was ho-hum for us. I felt myself fidgeting in the seat
several times wondering when they were going to get to the point. The
film was about 45 minutes too long. The concept is very interesting,
but there are so many loopholes and unanswered questions and illogical
contrivances that we both just shook our heads and enjoyed the scenery.
I have to wonder where all of the high ratings for this flick are
coming from. I am not buying that as many people loved this thing on
the same par as Lord of the Rings and Godfather. This movie was so
pumped up that I was hoping for something brilliant like The Matrix. I
feel like I got something more similar to &#x22;The Happening&#x22;.
