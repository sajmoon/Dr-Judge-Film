The first 15mins of Inception are a dizzying test of your patience as a
movie goer. The images are thrilling and you really do get the feeling
you are watching something totally unique but it&#x27;s anyones guess what&#x27;s
going on. After that,things do start to level out a bit and the film is
not that difficult to follow, it&#x27;s just a case of keeping up. What i
liked about the film was that is doesn&#x27;t pander to the dumbed down,big
studio mentality of many modern blockbusters but instead expects you to
keep pace with the story. The payoff for doing so is one of the more
satisfying movie watching experiences you are likely to have. The film
echoes Total Recall, The Matrix and more recently Shutter Island the
latter sharing more than a few identical elements including a very
similar,albeit impressive scenery chewing performance from DiCaprio.
The thread of the story being dreams and layers of dreams is a
fascinating one and has you glued to the screen. The overall look of
the film is very ordinary, gritty and down to earth. Lots of &#x27;bleach
bypass&#x27; looking shots and a real earthyness to ground the film in a
form of reality which lends itself well. The supporting cast are all
great with and the music adds a lot of presence. The special effects
are used brilliantly and interestingly it is the physical effects that
leave the longest lasting impression. The massive success of the film
can probably be explained by a very clever marketing campaign and a
post Dark Knight Christopher Nolan at the helm. The sheer scale of the
idea and the skill in getting it to the screen in a coherent way must
surely mean Nolan will win an academy award this year.
