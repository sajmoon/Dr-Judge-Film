I&#x27;ve seen it twice so far: Inception is a fabulous high quality heist
movie in which nothing is taken: instead an idea is implanted: in the
mind of a mark(Murphy) but also the audience... Its also a journey into
the underworld...and calls to mind the story of Orpheus and
Eurydice...and his journey to rescue his wife from death. Cobb may not
be able to rescue his dead wife, but his obsession with her leads him
in the end to making a journey deep into an Underworld, where she has
become a more vindictive character. Like Orpheus: Cobb cant return Mal
to the world of the living: he can only let her go... Also another nice
twist is to have an Ariadne who makes mazes. But She is also the thread
that guides the audience thru the story...she asks our questions..she
goes all the way to Limbo with Cobb, and her last words to him are
words of advice: to rescue Saito....as if she is implanting an idea in
his mind.. <br /><br />What a great cast of characters playing off one another: who lighten
the tense story Loved the scenes in the dreams when the van is in
freefall or rolling down the slope....as if in a dream! Quirks like:
after Yusuf has righted the van, he turns to share the experience with
the passengers...only then remembering they are asleep, and Arthus
playful kiss with Ariadne.. The most novel idea? the projections acting
like white blood cells against the invaders...
