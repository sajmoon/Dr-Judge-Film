Yes, this was a good movie with an original premise and exciting
action. No, this should not be ranked in the top 10 movies of all time!
The story is not THAT complicated ... you have to keep track of what,
four different subplots? Love Actually had twice that many intertwined
stories, yet nobody went berserk about the &#x22;complexity&#x22; of that movie.
I had to pay more attention than I would at your run-of-the-mill B
action movie, but I did not have this urge everyone keeps clamoring
about to immediately see it again. The acting was fine (Marion
Cotillard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt have always been favorites of mine),
but nothing spectacular. That&#x27;s not the fault of the actors - there&#x27;s
just not much to work with in the script, since the movie is all about
the plot. I never felt particularly emotionally tied to any of the
characters (and I am always the first to cover my face or cry at the
first sign of danger or drama!). I also think Ellen Page was miscast.
And finally, it was about 25 minutes too long; I found myself glancing
at my watch during the last action scenes.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t mean to sound overly critical - I&#x27;m giving it an 8/10 rating -
but I feel the same about this as the other Nolan movies: the story was
refreshingly innovative, but there&#x27;s still not enough depth to warrant
the crazed response by viewers.
