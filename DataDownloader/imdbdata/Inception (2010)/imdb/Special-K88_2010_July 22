Exciting, intricate, cerebral thriller from the one and only
Christopher Nolan. DiCaprio&#x97;a thief with heavy emotional baggage&#x97;is a
professional &#x22;dream extractor&#x22; who obtains inaccessible information
from others by penetrating their subconscious mind. With the aid of a
motley, high-precision team, he&#x27;s recruited by powerful businessman
Watanabe for his most difficult assignment yet and a definitive shot at
redemption&#x85;and the hits just keep on coming. Only director Nolan (who
captivated audiences with the labyrinthine thriller Memento) could pull
this one off, delivering a gripping, pulse-pounding, and multilayered
story that&#x27;s rich with emotion and nuance, endlessly inventive ideas,
intriguing plot twists, colorful characters, and more than enough
high-energy action/effects sequences. Film&#x27;s mind-boggling logic can be
confusing&#x97;to say the least&#x97;even questionable at times, but the script
always manages to deliver a new, effective twist to keep you on the
edge of your seat. The kind of film that requires a careful attention
span, and likely repeated viewings. ***&#xBD;
