Having seen this 24 hours ago the more I think about it the more I
think this is over-hyped and actually a rather poor movie. On leaving
the cinema I was prepared to give it a 7 (well short of it&#x27;s 9.3 on
IMDb) but on reflection I&#x27;m downgrading it to a 5.5.<br /><br />Why? For a start the writing is ridiculously weak. The plot, although
slightly intriguing in that you do make the effort to keep up with the
triple (or is it quadruple) levels of depth, is preposterous. In short
it&#x27;s about a dream within a dream within a dream. I think that&#x27;s
correct! But, that said, who cares? It might be crafty but it isn&#x27;t
crafted. It&#x27;s self indulgent in the extreme.<br /><br />Whilst not gratuitously violent, there are a lot of killings in this
film, but the &#x22;goodies&#x22; are dead eye dicks to a man (and woman) whilst
the &#x22;baddies&#x22; are way, way beyond inept. With five targets and two and
a half hours of incessant shooting I counted only 2 direct hits,
whereas the &#x22;baddies&#x22; must have taken in excess of 200 fatalities. Just
plain silly really.<br /><br />Then there&#x27;s the casting. Di Caprio is starting to look desperate for a
decent acting part and Ellen Page absolutely sucks compared to her
magnificent role in Juno (it&#x27;s the writing I tell ya).<br /><br />The special effects are at times good, on one or two occasions I&#x27;d call
them remarkable, but not on many. As an emotional engagement exercise
it has all the impact of a potato. I&#x27;ve been more moved by a night in
watching Blomberg TV.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan is just not that great a director or writer on this
occasion.<br /><br />Sorry folks.(His mind was the scene of a crime.)
