I first saw this at the theater it had a lot of hype and Oscar buzz.
Leonardo DiCaprio plays Cobb who hiding out Because he&#x27;s been blamed
for his wife&#x27;s death really she killed herself thinking she was in a
dream. Mainly the movie is about the power of dreams such things are
shown and brought up like a dream within a dream Trinkets that the main
characters have to prove if they are in a dream Cobb has a top that
keeps spinning if he&#x27;s in a dream Arthur (Joseph Gordon Levitt) has die
that lands on same number if he&#x27;s in a dream if someone die&#x27;s in a
dream they go into a deep sleep for years. The main plot is Cobb trying
to prove his Innocents with help of a girl named Ariadne who the newest
member of this team she learns how to manipulate dreams this makes for
some surreal scenes she and Cobb build a model maze in real life then
build a giant one in there dream. There is so many odd things in this
movie but you have to think about it in the final story-line Cobb
Ariadne and the gang go into Robert Fishers (Cillian Murphy&#x27;s) dream on
a plane to America to finally clear Cobb&#x27;s name and put an end to his
guilt. This is A lot like Science of sleep and even similar to
Nightmare on Elm street on how those movie are about the power of
dreams.I give it an 8/10
