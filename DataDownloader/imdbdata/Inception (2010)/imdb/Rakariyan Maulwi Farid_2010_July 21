I&#x27;ve seen this movie twice yet i&#x27;m still thrilled about it. Chris Nolan
IS the best director in the world even before he made this movie, and
with Inception, he&#x27;s just wanna remind everyone that he&#x27;s still the
best even though The Dark Knight released almost 2 years ago.<br /><br />Leo&#x27;s acting is probably the best one he has done so far, and the most
surprising is that Joseph Gordon Levitt, Tom Hardy, and Ellen Page
somehow almost stole Leo&#x27;s spotlight.<br /><br />Right now i&#x27;m still amazed of how Chris Nolan get the idea for this
movie! And the tagline, &#x22;Your Mind Is The Scene Of The Crime&#x22;, is also
one of the best tagline ever!<br /><br />I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Inception gets the best movie award in the
Academy Awards next year, along with Chris Nolan, Hans Zimmer, Leo
DiCaprio, and Ellen Page
