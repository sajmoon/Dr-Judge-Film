I watched the first day first show of the movie, it was amazing !!!<br /><br />First of all the story was brilliant and unique. It is actually very
difficult to implement such complex story because there are so many
characters and so many explanations of how things are going on and so
many levels in the movie.<br /><br />The concept of dreams and dreams inside dreams was unique. All the
action sequences were very well done.<br /><br />I think such complex stories only great directors can tell because
there were so many small pieces in the movie which needed to be
connected.<br /><br />I expect this film to be nominated for Oscars because of being unique
and very well made movie<br /><br />Only the directors like Christopher Nolan would dare to implement such
unique concepts .VERY GOOD !!!<br /><br />I would give this movie Rating : 10/10 , and it is a MUST SEE !!! (
Please watch it in theaters )
