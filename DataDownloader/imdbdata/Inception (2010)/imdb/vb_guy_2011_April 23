Was it all just a Dream?! I mean come on people, isn&#x27;t that the most
overly used clich&#xE9; in, perhaps, all of human history? (yes, I intended
to use another overly used clich&#xE9;) The brilliance of this movie is that
the makers somehow implanted into the minds of apparently 90%+ of the
posters that this is new, original and exciting.<br /><br />IMDb needs to start weighing these rankings. A movie from 1945 with a
ranking of say, 7.5, is likely a better picture than one from last
month with a 9.8. Considering the ranking for a film like Inception is
typically generated by the Facebook crowd, longevity needs to be
calculated into the rankings if they are to amount to a hill of beans.<br /><br />PS: JUNO was horribly, horribly, miscast. I will avoid any movie that
she appears outside of some high-school slapstick.
