I walked out of the theater in a totally different state of
consciousness and walked into a dimly lit glossy deep red tiled ladies
room. After entering the stall I felt as if I was still in an extension
of Dicaprio!s mind. What if every single character was an extension of
his tormented mind. Symbolizing his inner journey of letting go and
finally able to go home to the reality he longed for so desperately.
When the object of the mission comes to his own realization and says I
want to be my own man, the one my father wanted but could not be. That
part of Dicaprios psyche finally becomes real. He overcomes the ties of
heartfelt memory to his wife. <br /><br />The film experience was like being in the mind of the ultimate supreme
universal architect, and the brilliance and humaness of mans mind.<br /><br />Inception is genius. Quite the journey.
