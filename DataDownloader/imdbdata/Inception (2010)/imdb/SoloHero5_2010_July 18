When I thought The Dark Knight could not be topped, Nolan delivers this
picture and stuns all who gaze upon it. Leonardo DiCaprio turns another
role into a work of art.<br /><br />The directing is astonishing and the acting is spot on. The story line
sounds confusing when you read a review or a plot outline but when you
watch the movie everything falls perfectly into place.<br /><br />This is one of those movies where it wouldn&#x27;t be feasible to read about
it online. This movie must be watched to understand how well it was put
together. Avatar thrilled us because of its CGI, and Hurt Locker
thrilled us with its storyline but inception is something different and
it can&#x27;t be explained.<br /><br />There are some movies I would recommend someone to watch but Inception
is a movie everyone should watch.
