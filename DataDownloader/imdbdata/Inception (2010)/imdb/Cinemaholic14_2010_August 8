This movie is a masterpiece like most people say. Not like the ones
that take it to the extreme, though. A thoroughly thought out movie
indeed. An outstanding cast, soundtrack that you probably won&#x27;t pay
attention to but is still good, storyline that you CAN follow and is
mind-blowing, and entertaining, even when there isn&#x27;t big shootouts or
hand-to-hand combat, you are hooked the entire time...<br /><br />The cast, as I said, is outstanding, but I don&#x27;t think Leo was the only
performer that did great. Joseph Gordon-Levitt did- now what, everyone
on the cast delivered a good performance. I&#x27;m not going to even bother
with that part. Even if you don&#x27;t like the movie, I think you&#x27;d have to
admit, the acting was at least &#x22;pretty good&#x22;. So, on that note...<br /><br />I think you will notice the plot, since it is very deep and kind of
confusing, was well thought out, and looked over carefully. The idea of
going into someones mind, and giving or taking an idea from them, is
cool on its own. But the consequences, what happens, how it happens, is
even better. You will not pay attention to the little kids who&#x27;s
parents thought it was okay for them to see it but they didn&#x27;t get it,
the guy jabbering on the phone two rows above you, none of that. You
will focus on the movie. Well, unless those people are next to you,
that&#x27;s a different story.<br /><br />The script of this movie is like the storyline. Minus the confusing
part, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll understand what there saying. anyway, it has lots
of effort put into it. what they say isn&#x27;t stupid, it&#x27;s complicated and
smart. Nothing stupid, not clich&#xE9;s, none of that. It&#x27;s pretty darn
original if you ask me.<br /><br />The soundtrack I&#x27;m not really going to discuss since I didn&#x27;t really
pay attention to it, it was just kind of background noise. So all in
all, Inception is a masterpiece, if you want see it, it&#x27;ll be worth it.<br /><br />Overall: 10/10
