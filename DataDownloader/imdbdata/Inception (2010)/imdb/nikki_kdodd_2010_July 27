2010_July 27 
Firstly I want to say that I am fan of clever films that challenge the
brain, however, it is possible for a film to be so complicated, and
frankly...boring, that it becomes difficult to hold your interest. This
was definitely the case with this movie.<br /><br />Obviously the visual effects were excellent, that goes without saying,
but I left the movie thinking &#x22;what was the actual point?&#x22;. I am sure a
lot of people must just be jumping on the band wagon by rating this
movie highly, of perhaps pretending to get it, as I am positive I
cannot be the only one that found this film over complex and just plain
rubbish. In fact, I heard many of the people saying similar things as
they left the cinema.<br /><br />I like a film to entertain me, and having heard everyone raving about
this film I was bitterly disappointed to find it was a total &#x22;try too
hard&#x22; yawn-fest. The concept was good, however it just didn&#x27;t hit the
mark and was thoroughly un-entertaining. I found myself drifting off
wondering about what I would eat for dinner,and about things I needed
to do at work the next day, and that is the sign of a BAD movie.<br /><br />9.2 out of 10? I don&#x27;t think so, but each to their own.
