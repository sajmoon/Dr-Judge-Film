After &#x22;The Prestige&#x22; and &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22;, Christopher Nolan comes
forth to impress the public with yet another masterpiece: &#x22;Inception&#x22;.<br /><br />The movie tells the story of an adept thief, Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio),
trained to extract information from people&#x27;s subconscious while they
are dreaming. Troubled by the memories of his departed wife (Marion
Cotillard) and eager to return to his children, he accepts one last job
that can make it possible for him to come home. The task is the
opposite of extracting information: Cobb has to implant an idea in
someone&#x27;s head.<br /><br />I loved everything about this picture, but what stroke me most was its
originality. The hi-tech environment and the society pervaded by
industrial behemoths are the premises for a world in which man can&#x27;t
make the distinction between reality and imagination, truth and lie.
Consequently, the dream becomes the battlefield and the ultimate weapon
is the idea. The utter bewilderment of the modern man becomes his
religion and only his thoughts are the &#x22;parasites&#x22; resilient enough to
survive in this deceitful world.<br /><br />Aesthetically captivating, with stunning performances, great screenplay
and brilliant Hans Zimmer soundtrack, I believe &#x22;Inception&#x22; is a
milestone for the 21st century cinematography and a Nolan-branded
masterpiece about human mind ,ideas and imagination&#x85;but the question
remains: is the dream real?
