-- This is my first contribution of any kind to a Web-Page, so be
tolerable to me.<br /><br />-- INCEPTION!<br /><br />WOW! MIND-BLOWING! I thought, wait a minute, AVATAR is a movie which
definitely am ready to watch any time but here it is............
INCEPTION!<br /><br />ACTORS: Wonderful cast all the way ;<br /><br />headed by DiCAPRIO .. All have done magic.<br /><br />STORY: AMAZING! BREATH-TAKING!<br /><br />In a nutshell, INCEPTION is a movie which pushed me to write something
about it. This is the second time i&#x27;ve watched this movie and from
start till the end, God, it just takes you in a state where you start
questioning your idea of an IDEAL MOVIE! I&#x27;ve really really enjoyed
this movie.... although i hadn&#x27;t had a chance of watching the Cinema
Experience of it! I won&#x27;t be writing about the story because it would
be injustice, i believe, to know about the idea while not watching it.
So, for those out there who haven&#x27;t been &#x22;INCEPTED&#x22; yet, come&#x27;on guys
what are you waiting for!!!
