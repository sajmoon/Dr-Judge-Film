I must admit, I have a weakness for fantasy films. That said, I wasn&#x27;t
immediately drawn to Inception upon first viewing the trailer several
months back. After repeated advertising and a better look at the
special effects I soon became more interested in the concept. First
off, the acting was spot on. Not necessarily inspiring, but just the
right amount of seriousness and drive to really get the point across.
The idea of Inception was admirably executed giving us a nice blend of
theory and practical knowledge to bring the notion to reality. Not too
formulaic, but descriptive enough and multi-faceted in a way that
allowed me to really get into the art of Inception. I never got lost,
or presented with something over my head. The movie gives one a bit of
everything and allows the imagination to roam free. There&#x27;s the secret
agent element, shoot outs and such, corporate espionage, action buddy
sequences, young adult creativity, and even a doomed star cross lover
aspect. I was really into this film and was never bored. It keeps a
fluid pace with well thought out sub plots which helped me to get more
involved with the characters. I wanted to know what was going to happen
as opposed to waiting for it to end. ********** Now, here&#x27;s the
spoiler.********** The entire time I was thinking, this whole thing
better not just be a dream. The ending would have been better if we
were completely confirmed of the outcome. The only reason not to would
be if there was going to be a sequel. You get the feeling of what the
end result is, but not completely. Pretentious and unfulfilling. Make a
decision director. Is he dreaming or did he escape the dream. It&#x27;s like
a great escape movie without the escape. Come on, you can&#x27;t have it
both ways. Other than that, I really enjoyed Inception and found it to
be one of the better Summer releases to date.
