Great Cinematography ! Captivating story, thought provoking, great
visuals ! ... too much shooting and hunting ... Why not 10 stars ? <br /><br />&#x22;Inception&#x22; is interesting, quite original, an attempt to explore the
world of dreams. The exploration is a combination of known things about
dreams (e.g. outside stimuli influence dreams), and less know things
(questions), such as &#x22;What happens when we die in a dream ?&#x22;, &#x22;How is a
dream within a dream ?&#x22;, &#x22;What happens if two or more people could
share a dream ?&#x22; The answers Chris Nolan (both British and American by
birth) offers, may be viewed as speculations, of course, but,
nonetheless are interesting. Not seldom he gets the Physics right -
Gravity (= acceleration, as Einstein points out): loss of it; creation
of temporal artificial gravity. Chris Nolan suggest that Gravity
effects propagate to dreams - true or not, but interesting. He even
suggests that in a dream world, Gravitation my pull in multiple
directions ! <br /><br />I have my own questions: - Will understanding dreams help us further
uncover the mysteries of the mind ? - Will we ever be able to design
dreams - ours and others ? - Will we ever be able to share dreams ?
Will this be useful ? - Will we be able to visualize dreams, say on a
TV scream dreams ? - ours and others ? - Will this help treat currently
incurable and most destructive mind (brain) diseases such as
Schizophrenia, Bipolar Syndrome, Alzheimer, Parkinson ? - Will we ever
be able to do &#x22;Extraction&#x22; and &#x22;Inception&#x22; ? - for non- harmful, maybe
good purposes ... <br /><br />So, while we may not fully agree with the story proposed to us, the
film is thought provoking, but, because of the nested layered dreams
(dreams within a dream within a dream ...), hard to follow for many
viewers. That is where the DVD/Blu-ray comes to the rescue - Rewind
(many times) ! Not possible in the theatre, but easily done at home. <br /><br />Next, please, pay attention: at the end of the film, the top is still
spinning, which allows us, the viewer, to formulate two possible
interpretations: 1) It is, finally reality; 2) It is (still) a dream -
maybe, everything was a dream from the very beginning ... A fantasy ? A
good work of art (visual or written) should be susceptible to multiple
interpretations, right ? Hamlet: he is tormented - maybe he really saw
(the ghost of) his father, maybe not, maybe his uncle murdered his
father, maybe not ... should I take punitive action or not (&#x22; ... to be
or not to be ... &#x22;) . The Penrose Steps (nice drawings by Max Escher !)
- an optical illusion: are we going up or down ? Maybe both at the same
time. <br /><br />I like Leonardo di Caprio and Marion Cotillard a lot. The personal
story of the characters they play (story which causes trouble to all)
brings humanity and depth to this film, and the two actors are very
convincing in their roles. By the way, &#x22;Mal&#x22; means &#x22;bad&#x22; in French. <br /><br />My only real criticism is this (therefore 4.5/5 stars): too much
shooting, too many people chasing each other, and too often - it makes
it more attractive to some viewers, but ***lowers*** the overall value
of the film ! It makes it look &#x22;less deep&#x22; than Chris Nolan would have
liked. Notice this: The Academy nominated this film in several
categories, among others: &#x22;Best Film&#x22; (which refers to the producers,
one being Chris Nolan), &#x22;Best Original Story&#x22; (Chris Nolan), but not
&#x22;Best Director&#x22; (who is also Chris Nolan). Maybe this is due exactly to
the fact others noticed the same thing: long and frequent chases, lots
of shooting ...<br /><br />The thrilling should come more from the tension between characters,
from the collision between their minds and souls, their problems,
worries, and less from fast paced and sustained action sequences. <br /><br />Last but not least I like the use of one of my longtime favorite songs:
&#x22;Non, je ne regrette rien&#x22; sung by Edith Piaf. It is used in the film
as a signal to wake-up the dreamers in a synchronized fashion (it even
propagates from one dream level to the next), but, perhaps it also
means this: no matter what happens, or happened, whether this is
reality or it was just a dream, I do not take anything back (I regret
nothing).
