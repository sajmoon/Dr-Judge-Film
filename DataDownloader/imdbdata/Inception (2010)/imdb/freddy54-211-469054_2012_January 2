Inception is a film that thinks it&#x27;s too clever by half and then sets
about insulting its audience by presuming they have no brain. No amount
of pseudo-intelligence, rubbish dialogue and overuse of special effects
can redeem this pile of junk. An inferior video game masquerading as
high art.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan thinks he is a great director by basing his story on
Freudian assumptions and psycho-babble but the dialogue is
incomprehensible and the use of A-listers to carry the film shows that
they are far more interested in making money than utilising their
acting skills.
