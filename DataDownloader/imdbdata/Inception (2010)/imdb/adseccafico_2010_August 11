Let&#x27;s face facts, the last decade sucked. The economy was terrible, we
allowed an idiot to thrust the country into a war we cannot get out of,
and the pop culture took a turn for the worst. Whether it&#x27;s the
Twilight films, Jersey Shore, or Lady GaGa, I feel ashamed to be apart
of my generation. That was until I discovered Chris Nolan.<br /><br />Chris Nolan has always done great work, but this is by far his best
picture. I can see him going to Warner Brothers with the idea for
Inception and telling the powers that be, &#x22;Alright, I did the Batman
movies, now I want to do something of mine&#x22;! Needless to say, if you&#x27;ve
saved a major franchise, I doubt a studio will tell you no.<br /><br />The film itself is complex, however isn&#x27;t impossible to understand. I
could see the countless hours of research Nolan did for the film on the
screen. You can tell that every little detail was looked at with
caution, which made the story an absolute pleasure to watch.<br /><br />The cast was superb, with DiCaprio standing out. People argue that his
performance in Inception was almost identical to his performance in
Shutter Island. I thought the one true difference was the character he
played. In Shutter Island, DiCaprio is an anti-hero who isn&#x27;t given
much of a goal during the duration of the story. In Inception, he&#x27;s
more of an Archietyple hero and is given stronger character traits as
well as a set goal to reach by the end of his character&#x27;s story.<br /><br />When I said that this is what the world&#x27;s been looking for, I meant
that I think we&#x27;ve found a movie that shows how originality will always
triumph over re-hashed plots and Michael Bay films. If you&#x27;re a young
filmmaker like I am, the film gives you a renewed sense of optimism in
your craft. That your ideas do matter, and they can make a great movie.
