I have noticed throughout the film world that people tend to either
have ridiculous action and no depth or vice versa. Inception keeps you
entertained and offers you something to think about if you want to. The
imagination behind this film is ridiculous, as it should be because it
interprets the human mind into its on own universe in a nutshell; a
world as your playground to some aspect. Many people tend to over look
the complexity behind directing and especially creative writing. His
adaption to his own script into big screen is very clever. This is the
most intense movie that has been released this year. Although, many
people have compared this film to an amine called paprika that involves
diving into dreams as well. Also note that many of the jokers clever
schemes were derived from Alan Moore&#x27;s(watchmen, V for Vendetta, From
Hell etc)adaption to the batman story. But nonetheless this movie is
incredible, everyone has their sources, see this, in Imax.
