What a bore, all these fighting, pursuing, exploding sequences in a
film that purported to be a descent into dreams and the unconscious
mind! The adult moviegoer inevitably says: ENOUGH of such simplistic
shortcuts to box office. Hollywood films are not interesting anymore
for the general audience AND the thinking viewer. All this said,
&#x22;Inception&#x22; is not a terrible film: it is that hybrid creature, the
ambitious potboiler. So the screenplay, the actors, even some special
effects (see the weightless sequences towards the end of the movie) are
interesting enough to make us sigh at the thought of where a mature
treatment of the same subject could have led. On another level, one
cannot stop wondering why the film&#x27;s dreams are so visually banal.
Nobody is asking here for another dream sequence painted by Salvador
Dali like in the Hitchcock masterpiece, &#x22;Spellbound&#x22;, but it seems
absurd that nothing in &#x22;Inception&#x22; looks even remotely surreal or
fantastic (some of the weightless scenes excluded). All in all, another
disappointing fantasy that could have been a much more interesting film
-- if only it had avoided to include such an embarrassing amount of
platitudes.
