Nolan is a wonderful craftsman obsessed with dreams and the nature of
reality. From Memento and Insomnia, &#x22;What is real?&#x22; has been a central
question in his films. DiCaprio is a wonderful craftsman. The
production values in this film were outstanding.The storyline was weak.
The &#x22;original&#x22; metaphors and ideas had appeared before in the Matrix
Sequels, Angel Heart, and Blade Runner. Was not disappointed but do not
think is a generationally great or life-changing film. Both Nolan and
DiCaprio tried really really hard and made one of the best films of the
year. Anyone who thinks this film was game changing apparently hasn&#x27;t
seen enough films to know what game-changing is.
