Let me just say from the get go that I normally love cheesy movies like
this! It&#x27;s light entertainment and often that&#x27;s all that I need.
However, this snorrer is just plain dull. Even seeing it in IMAX 3-D
didn&#x27;t help.<br /><br />The characters were dull; even the comic relief was dull! The only good
notes in the thing was Liam Neeson and Ray Finnes (no surprise there)
who have one or two good moments. Kudos also to Bill Nighy who has fun
with his now patented goofy wacko character. Otherwise it&#x27;s hard to
have any fun with the rest of them. If Sam Worthington was any more
wooden he&#x27;d win the Steven Boyd manikin award for acting. <br /><br />Who wrote this thing and what group of knuckleheads thought it would be
a good idea to finance it? Save your money; save yourself. Wait for
May.
