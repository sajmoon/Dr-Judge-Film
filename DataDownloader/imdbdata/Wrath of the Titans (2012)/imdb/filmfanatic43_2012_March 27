Wrath of the Titans is exactly the same as its awful predecessor
without the campiness. The film follows Perseus as he embarks on a
quest to save his dad from Hades, Ares, and Kronos. All of the actors
in the film appear to have hardly put any work into their performances
especially Sam Worthington who, just like in Clash of the Titans, is
completely boring making Perseus a character that no one cares for. The
storyline is almost nonexistent and seems to only exist as a way to set
up the next action sequence. Clash of the Titans was an absolute
disaster but its campiness was hilarious and it was extremely
entertaining watching Liam Neeson yell &#x22;Release the Kraken&#x22;. Wrath of
the Titans on the other hand is basically the same with decent visual
effects and without any campiness at all making it an unnecessary
sequel to an unnecessary remake of a decent film that was made several
years ago.
