i went to see this movie with not really high expectations and it
turned out to be really AWFUL! and here comes why: 1-the storytelling
is pretty dull and boring 2-acting just looks like acting with no
emotional link to any of the characters. 3-the monsters in this movie
are just ......silly especially the cyclops. 4-the action sequences are
not remarkable at all.<br /><br />finally it is just another stupid movie from Hollywood and i would like
to mention that these kind movies was really great in the 1950s and
1960s like for example The seventh voyage of Sinbad it is just one of
greatest B movies of all time.<br /><br />verdict:just avoid this piece of crap of a movie.
