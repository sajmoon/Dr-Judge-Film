I enjoyed this marginally more than Clash remake but that really
doesn&#x27;t say much.<br /><br />It&#x27;s plenty more of the same here: disingenuous re-branding of Greek
mythology in a mainstream-friendly format. <br /><br />Sam Worthington outdoes himself in this one, as the most bland lead
actor of all time - including even Bill Paxton. The FX are BIG but what
exactly does that do for a film? Hot air balloons are big too. I saw
this in 2D (thank goodness), which might have been the saving factor.
3D is such a headache and blurry irritation, that the already blurred
and hyperactive monster animations would have been a mess.<br /><br />The only thing that saves this movie from being utter **** is the
promise of some big fiery guy (Chronos) being unleashed to wreak havoc.
When he does, it is a bit of a disappointment but not too bad.<br /><br />I saw this with my 6 year old son. Not recommended for adults.
