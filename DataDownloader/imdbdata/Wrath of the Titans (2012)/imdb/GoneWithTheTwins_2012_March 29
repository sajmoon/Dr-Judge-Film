In an attempt to outdo 2010&#x27;s Clash of the Titans, the sequel Wrath of
the Titans introduces larger, more insidious foes for the noble
warriors to battle. Yet the bigger the monsters get, the smaller the
story becomes. Wrath presents an overly simplistic, straightforward
plot that rarely utilizes its potential for awe, trading a few moments
of impressive special effects for genuine adventure. The classic
concept of fighting a minotaur in a maze is reduced to a brief scuffle
in a pointlessly complex labyrinth (which the protagonists haphazardly
stumble out of), the lazily crafted scenarios are predictable and
tired, and the lifeless personas shift from location to location in a
mundane waiting game for the next appearance by a giant monster. Sadly,
a nagging indifference for the foreseeable conclusion even diminishes
the colossal grandeur of the final gargantuan enemy.<br /><br />Several years have passed since Perseus (Sam Worthington), the son of
Zeus (Liam Neeson), defeated the Kraken and saved a kingdom. The
revered demigod now lives the simple life of a fisherman while raising
his young son Helius (John Bell) &#x96; without the help of Io (from the
first film), who has too conveniently passed away. When Zeus returns to
inform him of a new threat &#x96; the impending escape of the monstrous
Kronos from his underworld prison of Tartarus &#x96; Perseus must once again
fight to save the gods and humanity alike. Joining forces with
Poseidon&#x27;s son Agenor (Toby Kebbell) and Queen Andromeda (Rosamund
Pike), the intrepid soldiers must search for the mysterious Fallen One
to uncover a weapon worthy of defeating the very father of the gods.<br /><br />In Wrath of the Titans, the gods start to lose their power and dwindle
away as humans forget to pray to them. This sounds a bit like some
fairy tale or Santa Claus, not the mighty immortals of ancient
mythology. It also mutates into something along the lines of Star Wars,
with its polestar of familial betrayal followed by recapturing the good
in rebellious relatives, and finally with joining forces to overcome
evil. A derivative labyrinth with shape-shifting qualities like the one
seen in Alien vs. Predator (a most unfortunate film to copy) turns up,
as well as Cyclopes from Sinbad and monstrosities from recent video
games. When the creativity is at such a low, it hardly matters that the
story seems improvised on the spot, with characters that appear and
vanish without impacting the story, and an unshakeable emptiness to the
scenery changes and unorganized quest.<br /><br />The computer graphics are definitely more impressive this second time
around, with a final monstrous antagonist that is as awe-inspiring as
the plot is feeble; both are at noteworthy extremes. Even with the
attention to colossal battles, destruction, and elephantine enemies,
the fights between titans and mortals is never fully convincing, most
noticeably due to the differences in size and strength. It doesn&#x27;t help
that Perseus&#x27; abilities are never clearly defined, requiring stitches
and wincing in pain during one attack, yet shrugging off a duel with
Ares in which Perseus&#x27; head is smashed repeatedly into stone columns.
It&#x27;s also pitiable to see the tiniest bits of comic relief squeezed
into the dialogue (&#x22;Go to hell,&#x22; requests Agenor, just before the group
departs for the underworld) &#x96; there doesn&#x27;t seem to be room for humor
in this particular world of barbarians, beasts, gods and fantastical
powers. Wrath of the Titans is, however, likely to get intrigued
audiences to research the real stories behind Greek mythology, which
are always far more fascinating than their filmic counterparts.<br /><br />- The Massie Twins (GoneWithTheTwins.com)
