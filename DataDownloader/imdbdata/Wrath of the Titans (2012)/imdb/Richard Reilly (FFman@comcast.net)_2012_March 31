Epic movies have been around for several years now. Simply throwing
action and graphics at a movie can no longer make it great. Epics have
been pulled down to the level of an average movie. We must care about
the characters. The dialogue must be worthwhile. The storyline cannot
be linear and bland. Wrath of the Titans, although enjoyable, did not
get the memo.<br /><br />Wrath of the Titans follows a linear storyline. Any person who has any
knowledge of Greek mythology with grow bored of the overused story of
the labyrinth, Kronos, and how being part human makes you stronger than
a God. The storyline has absolutely no originality. It&#x27;s almost like
the screenwriter read Percy Jackson and the Olympians and decided to
turn the series into a more adult movie.<br /><br />Luckily, there are several aspects that save Wrath of the Titans from
being horrible. For one, the dialog worked. Mix that with the fantastic
graphics and you have a movie that you can sit back and enjoy&#x97; so long
as you don&#x27;t think too much. At the heart, the original Greek mythology
about Gods overthrowing Titians is quite intriguing. It&#x27;s just been
done far too often<br /><br />I must note that this movie should have been longer. The opening was
far too short. You barely see the town in which Perseus and his son
live before it gets ripped apart. With no buildup, it is impossible to
care for the characters. This makes the movie little more than Greek
Myth brought to life with no depth. It is truly unfortunate. A movie
like this has so much potential. It was all wasted with a horrible
screenwriter.<br /><br />If you like Greek Mythology or enjoyed Clash of the Titans, this is a
movie you might want to see. If that is not the case, it&#x27;s not
something you will want to see in theatres (or at all). There have been
much better action/adventure movies so far this year&#x97;The Grey and
Chronicle are two. Wrath of the Titians is a movie with potential.
Unfortunately, the makers of the movie forgot to turn that potential
into gold.<br /><br />reillyreviews.wordpress.com
