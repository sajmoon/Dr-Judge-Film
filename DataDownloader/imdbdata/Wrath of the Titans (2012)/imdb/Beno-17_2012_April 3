2012_April 3 
A friend and I saw this the other week and quite frankly I&#x27;m astounded
that anyone could rate this higher than 1 out of 10. It is definitely
the worst movie I&#x27;ve seen all year, I can only imagine very young
children finding it enjoyable and even their mental capacity might be
too great for this one.<br /><br />The characters are unconvincing, Sam Worthington was terrible in
contrast to his performance in Avatar and the screenwriter should be
taken out to pasture. The worst part is that you never really care
about the story or any of the characters at all.<br /><br />Toward the end we were actually laughing at some of the lines and the
direction that the story went! I don&#x27;t know how Liam Neeson gets
involved in this trash! Lets all hope they don&#x27;t make a third!
