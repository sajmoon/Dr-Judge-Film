the second installment the wrath of the titans was a considerable more
thoughtful then clash of the titans but that doesn&#x27;t mean its brainy...
some 3d sequences in the movie are actually so good that i actually
jumped from my seat 2-3 times so yes to 3d was the best I have ever
seen and performance by sam worthington, liam neeson ralph fienes and
rosamond pike were good the overall movie could been much better.. it
was a bit boring in do places and climax was kind of abrupt so the
question is is it worth going to theatre and shedding OK extra bucks
for seeing it 3d... know if you wanna see alight action packed fantasy
adventure then this is definitely worth the money
