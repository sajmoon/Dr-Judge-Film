Wow, I love it when Hollywood surprises me. Wraith of the Titans was a
good movie, not great, not epic but good. Sam Worthington is much
better in this movie, usually very stiff, he is definitely learning to
express himself better. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are awesome as
always, and their own story line was great. Now Rosamund Pike was under
used however she did a great job, I just wanted more of her, who
wouldn&#x27;t? (wink) <br /><br />The story is good, straight forward and the special effects are great.
I saw this in 2D and didn&#x27;t think I lost anything, might see it in 3D.
The main difference here as opposed to Clash was the characters were
much more lively, more interesting and more enjoyable to watch. Toby
Kebbell does an excellent job of keeping the mood light and funny,
making this a very entertaining ride.
