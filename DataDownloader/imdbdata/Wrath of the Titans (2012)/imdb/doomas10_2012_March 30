Everyone knew and knows that i HATED with passion the first film. It
was beyond terrible. It wasn&#x27;t even mindless fun for my standards. The
main hero was annoying to say at least who kept moaning &#x22; i will do
this as a man&#x22;, his choices were contradicting with the previous ones
he recently made, the direction was faceless, the action utterly
unexciting and despite the promise of a monster-gathering, it wasn&#x27;t
that interesting after all. The generic designs and the lack of an
energetic direction or at least set pieces generated an incredible
borefest. And let&#x27;s not talk about the story. It made no sense and it
wasn&#x27;t that simple to follow even though the initial premise was &#x22;A
going to B to achieve C&#x22;. Only saving grace was the inspiring for the
god characters cast which at the end was a wasted artistic opportunity.<br /><br />Thus, i am in the pleasant position to announce that despite the
irrational story presented in the &#x22;Wrath&#x22;, this sequel is ten million
times better than the first. Of course it won&#x27;t be given the title of a
&#x22;very good&#x22; film, hell not even a &#x22;good&#x22; one, but the &#x22;entertaining&#x22;
caption would be spot on. The talented hack Jonathan Liebesman (of the
&#x22;Texas chainsaw massacre: the beginning&#x22; and &#x22;Battle: Los Angeles&#x22;
fame) manages to bring actually some gravitas and nerve to the
proceedings, more compelling (than the first attempt of Leterie)
characters, flawless CGI and surprisingly witty creature design and
clever production design.<br /><br />&#x22;Wrath&#x22; feels actually closer to the spirit of Sony&#x27;s &#x22;God of War&#x22;
video game series. This can be seen when the Titan Cronos makes his
well conceived and executed appearance. At this point the film reaches
cosmic proportions, making the Kraken to look like a baby doll. While
most films disappoint when they reach the long-awaited climax, &#x22;Wrath&#x22;
offers more and more spectacle of biblic level. The special effects are
stunning and i cannot take from my head the scale of awesomeness that
was displayed in front of me. The whole screen was on fire and the lava
effects looked undeniably...sophisticated! Just for the appearance of
Cronos, the film deserves the price of admission alone. This was
directed by the same dude of one of the most horrible horror prequels
of all time and one completely forgettable &#x22;B:LA&#x22;?<br /><br />Or maybe it was the fact that my expectations were so low that i ended
up astonished by the effort seeing on screen. Hell, they don&#x27;t even
take themselves seriously. Americanised one liners and some small shots
of humor make the whole experience more...fun. The cast is doing what
they can with the unfortunately still weak material. Liam Neeson and
Ralph Fiennes (give awards to the casting director) are the standouts
of the movie with more than i thought characterization and a bit more
complicated relationship that caught me off guard. Edgar Ramirez as
Ares is also awesome but he has limited screen time like Danny
Houston&#x27;s Poseidon. Maybe a director&#x27;s cut will add a bit depth? Who
knows. And yes Sam Worthingthon is actually DECENT in this rather than
a whiny loser. He gets to kick some ass from one famous Greek monster
to another unlike the first film where he did nothing (without the help
of gods)<br /><br />Hence, there is not a single shot of sunshine acting, no room to
breathe. The sequel moves with bullet speed from one innovative action
sequence to another with thrilling fights and larger than life
monsters. That&#x27;s good but sometimes it may tire those who are not
familiar to non- stop roller-coaster rides and hand-held camera-work.
Additionally, some silly plotwists-gods can die, extra betrayals, other
main gods are not present?! (Apollonas, Hermes, Aphrodite etc)- seem to
be happening for the creation of more ancient Greek mayhem on screen.
My main complaint though is that i still haven&#x27;t seen a god fighting a
god with devastating effects. Maybe the third time around?<br /><br />Despite knowing the mythology as a Greek inside and outside, this is
not an adaptation of the famous myths but a damn entertaining film that
knows how to pleasure film fans with non-insulting material. You just
need to switch off your brain just before you go inside the theater and
all will be fine. Mark my words!<br /><br />+ witty production design, larger than life blockbuster, epic in scale,
good cast, brilliant action sequences - story could have a bit more
depth, when are we going to see a god vs a god??<br /><br />8/10
