It was better than the first movie (Clash of the Titans - 2010) but it
wasn&#x27;t epic like you hope befitting of the title about Greek
mythological gods. Hollywood typically likes to keep their films moving
along by cutting short on story depth and character development, both
of which afflicted this movie. The plot is simple and follows 10 years
after the conclusion of Clash of the Titans. They kept the same cast in
this sequel; Of noteworthy is Perseus, the half-god, son of Zeus, and
protagonist, played by Sam Worthington (Avatar and Man on a Ledge).<br /><br />In sacrificing depth and char dev, the movie had a lot of action. At
the heart of all the action were special effects. The CGIs were
impressive and, essentially, what made the movie. A scene of fiery
rocks hurling at the screen in 3D made me dodge before I caught myself.
Lol The music complemented the action well and added to the visceral
experience. The bass and horns were almost as loud and deep as in the
movie Inception.<br /><br />If you dig deeper though, you may find flaws, poor logic and mythology
that isn&#x27;t true to Greek mythology but rather loosely based. For
example, the audience can see plenty of wrath from Kronos (Greek,
Cronus), but its fury translates into little substance in the battle as
he was seemingly too easily beatable. You learn that the gods&#x27; powers
are dependent on human prayers. W/o prayers, their powers wane and
their immortality fade into dust. So Zeus isn&#x27;t the immortal and
all-powerful Greek god you had envisioned reading about growing up. <br /><br />In conclusion, if you can watch with an open mind and are OK with a
shallow storyline, then the action and visual fx are worth the price of
admission. It&#x27;s a good action flick with great CGI. I give it a 6 to
6.5 out of 10.
