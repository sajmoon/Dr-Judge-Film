OK as many have said the movie is vastly improved from the first one
most notably the 3D here is excellent I was ducking, dodging it was
great. The CGI was in a word Dynamic, the Cyclops, Chronos oh how I
loved it and I&#x27;m a child of Ray HarryHausen Era this movie is a must
see. There are so many improvements its hard to tell you all of them
without spoiling it so I&#x27;m not gonna go there. The acting is much
better everyone delivers most of all Sam Worthington&#x27;s performance has
more depth I did miss Gemma Atherton or the appearance of Apollo thats
so minor in the greater scheme of things the pacing is perfect I was
thrilled from start to finish.
