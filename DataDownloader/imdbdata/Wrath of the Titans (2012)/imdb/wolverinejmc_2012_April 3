2012_April 3 
Well darn, at least Clash of the titans, while cheesy to a fault,
entertained me. It was two years ago, and I left a theater mildly
entertained but ultimately let down by horrid 3d effects and an
underwhelming lead man in Sam Worthington. fast forward two years and
here we are again, with expensive special effects and a two dollar
script. it&#x27;s not that Wrath is horrible, but it does not improve upon
it&#x27;s predecessor in any way, which is it&#x27;s final downfall. Worthington
seems more comfortable in the role this time(I spy a smile!) but the
script denies him any time to flesh Perseus out.<br /><br />In fact, the script let every actor down. Ares, portrayed by Edgar
Ramirez, is hopelessly sullen and Fiennes&#x27; Hades has by far the worst
lines in the film. Liam Neeson phones it in, with his beard doing most
of the work. Also, Bill Nighy randomly shows up as Hephaestus, the
keeper of the labyrinth, and while his kookiness is most welcome, he is
granted around ten minutes screen time. And finally poor Rosemund Pike,
playing a tough queen, gets knocked down and around by both monsters
and a two dimensional character arc. Wrath of the Titans&#x27; only
improvement is it&#x27;s special effects, which are indeed quite amazing.
Kronos, while suffering from short screen time, is an awesome sight,
except for when he stands( too much torso, not enough leg). His arms of
molten rock spew destruction everywhere, and you can see the money on
the screen. Other titans fair just as well, but the director seems
unsure of the effects work, and keeps the camera jittering along.
Overall, Wrath really did nothing that Clash didn&#x27;t do, and failed to
truly entertain. the only time my heart beat fast during the movie was
when the Prometheus trailer came on in 3d. That was the highlight of
the film.
