First let me say that this is no 300 or Lord of the Rings epic as the
multiple trailers would have you believe but it definitely surpasses
the first one in every way. Plot,acting,action,F/X,and 3D are all what
you should expect from a popcorn movie like this the only thing that
would have made it more entertaining would be blood and gore added to
all the hacking and slashing that goes on or at least more
decapitations and dismemberment&#x27;s but then the movie would have lost
millions due to limited viewing .<br /><br />My review on the plot. (NO SPOILERS PRESENT) Many people including
my-self complained about the paper thin plot clash of titans had so
when I heard that Wrath of Titans was being directed by Jonathan
Liebesman the directer of (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The
Beginning,and Battle:Los Angeles) I was skeptical that the plot was
going to be any better because as good as Battle L.A was in the
action,and F/X, the plot was almost as thin as Clash of Titans was but
i,am happy to report the plot is a lot better in depth and they
actually included Titans in the plot.<br /><br />My review of the acting. The acting is a lot better than the first
manly because of the writing and the script and I think Sam Worthington
in maturing as an actor and as a result he gives a fine performance
rivaling avatar,the only one i had any problem with was Rosamund Pike
her performance as Andromeda the worrier princes was a bit wooden and
not very believable but the rest of the cast was at their very best.<br /><br />My review of the action and F/X. The action was top notch and non-stop
and far better in every way than the first one the only thing missing
was blood after the blows.The F/X was amazing nothing looked fake the
creatures,the set pieces, every stick and stone, looked amazing perfect
eye-candy can&#x27;t wait to see it on bluray.<br /><br />My review of the 3D. The 3D was applied in post production just like
the first one so I was scared the the 3D was going to be a bust but to
my surprise the 3D was good but no comparison to avatar or transformers
3 but all in all the 3D was good.It gave depth to the movie most of all
in the action scenes when the cyclops popped on screen he literally
popped out of the screen and that was amazing.<br /><br />All in all this is a perfect movie to kick back relax with a large
popcorn in one hand and a large coke in the other with your feet prop
up on the seat ahead of you unless occupied and forget your problems
for 99 minutes and after the movie you will fill as you can conquer the
gods so i give it a 7 out of 10
