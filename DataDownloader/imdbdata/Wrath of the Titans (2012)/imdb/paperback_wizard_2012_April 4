Now, I actually liked the remake of Clash of the Titans better than the
original, as I&#x27;ve written before. Though the plots were very similar, I
felt the characters had better development and motivation in the
remake. Unfortunately, Wrath of the Titans takes a step backwards in
that regard.<br /><br />Take Perseus, played again by Sam Worthington. In the 1981 Clash, he
was sort of a generic hero who sort of generically decided to save the
world and marry Princess Andromeda. In the remake, he&#x27;s given actual
motivation for his actions. He&#x27;s a half-man, half-god whose adopted
human family was just killed and blames the gods for their deaths, and
must reconcile his divine heritage with his desire to live as a man.
Whatever you may think of Worthington&#x27;s performance in the remade
Clash, the effort was certainly made to give some depth to his
character.<br /><br />In Wrath, however, he sort of falls back into his generic role as the
&#x22;demi-god hero&#x22;. Not for lack of trying, mind you. They do give him a
son and a half-brother (Ares, played by &#xC9;dgar Ram&#xED;rez), but neither
they nor he spend much time on screen developing themselves past their
surface traits. That&#x27;s a shame, too, because Ares, the God of War,
could have been such an impressive character, especially since he
betrays his father Zeus (Liam Neeson) to the Titan Kronos. Instead, the
God of War comes across as more than a little ... whiny as he berates
Zeus for being a bad father to him. The rivalry between Ares and
Perseus is never really explored, but you can&#x27;t imagine there being
much to explore given that Ares actually lives with Zeus on Mount
Olympus and Perseus lives as a human with his son and didn&#x27;t even like
Zeus all that much in the last movie. Why does Perseus seem so devoted
to his father now? Why does Ares seem to think Zeus has grown so close
to his half-human son? Those are two questions the movie never even
tried to answer, but should have.<br /><br />Next on the list of underdeveloped (and underutilized) characters is
the demi-god Agenor (played by Toby Kebbell), the son of Poseidon
(Danny Huston). We first meet Agenor in an Argos prison. Apparently,
he&#x27;s something of a master conman/thief/liar, but his father, the God
of the Sea, trusts him and sends Perseus to enlist him in the fight
between Olympians and Titans. Agenor could, potentially, have been the
most interesting character in the movie, as charming rogues with hearts
of gold have a tendency to be. However, we&#x27;re not given much of his
backstory, which leaves us with the vague clich&#xE9;d assumption that his
father abandoned him, he turned to a life of crime and cons to survive,
and the news of his father&#x27;s death has shaken him so that he&#x27;s decided
to give being a good guy (for a price) another shot. To be fair,
hearing that a god has died would make anyone stop and think; and it
gives us one of the better exchanges in the movie: Agenor: Gods don&#x27;t
die.<br /><br />Perseus: They do now.<br /><br />You see, it&#x27;s not that this is a bad movie. The dialogue, for the most
part, is actually pretty good. The plot, while it&#x27;s more akin to epic
fantasy than traditional Greek myths, is an interesting one. And the
settings and special effects are, quite frankly, spectacular. The
labyrinth that leads into Tartarus, where Zeus is being slowly drained
of his life force so that Kronos can be freed of his prison, is an
incredible shifting stone maze. The creature effects, especially the
Chimera and the Makhai, are stunning and even fairly realistic. But the
movie revolves entirely around the plot, which is a fairly basic one
and even mirrors the plot of the 2010 movie. The characters are just
going through the motions, like a puppet show with really good visuals.
I understand that, at nearly two hours in length, it could hardly take
more time for character development, but there are ways they could have
gotten around that.<br /><br />I&#x27;d recommend this movie, personally. It&#x27;s exhilarating, and at times
quite hilarious. For all that it has very little character development
(and only one Titan), it&#x27;s still a good movie.<br /><br />(This review originally appeared at http://fourthdayuniverse.com/ )
