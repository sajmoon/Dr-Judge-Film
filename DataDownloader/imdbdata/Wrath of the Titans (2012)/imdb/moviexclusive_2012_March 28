The Gods indeed deserved better than the 2010 remake of &#x27;Clash of the
Titans&#x27;, a wholly ill-conceived attempt at revisiting the campy Ray
Harryhausen sword-and-sorcery epic that instead replaced the original&#x27;s
stop-motion visual effects with second-rate CG effects. And certainly,
the producers seemed to have heeded the call with this sequel,
retaining the fine cast from the original- Sam Worthington, Liam Neeson
and Ralph Fiennes- while opting for fresh writers and a new director.<br /><br />It&#x27;s still as important however to keep your hopes down for &#x27;Wrath of
the Titans&#x27;, especially for those expecting a sweeping mythological
epic. Taking over the reins from French director Louis Leterrier is
Johnathan Liebesman, and going by his previous works- &#x27;The Texas
Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning&#x22; and &#x22;Battle: Los Angeles&#x22;- the man is
at best an efficient but uninspired director who pays more attention to
visceral pleasures than to anything resembling depth.<br /><br />That is certainly true of his work here, which vastly improves the
action sequences of the original but little else. As if singularly
devoting his time to create mind-numbing big-budget sequences,
Liebesman invests little in the story and in his characters- God,
demi-god and human alike. Both are mechanical at best and engineered
with a specific purpose of taking his viewer from one jaw-dropping
sequence to another, never mind the inconsistencies or the leaps of
logic along the way.<br /><br />So despite the exposition, the plot of the entire movie can be summed
up in a one line- to save Zeus (Neeson) from his conniving brother
Hades (Fiennes) and jealous son Aroes (Edgar Ramirez), the demi-god
Perseus (Worthington) leaps back into full battle mode since retiring
ten years ago to a quiet life in a small fishing village. Before facing
the worst of them all, Perseus will have to go up against a host of
hideous- looking monsters- a fiery-mouthed Chimera with two heads at
the front and a snake&#x27;s head at its tail; a trio of towering Cyclops
giants; a Minotaur; and a band of half-man, half-rock soldiers with
four arms and two bodies that twist around on a pair of legs.<br /><br />There&#x27;s no denying that the creatures this time are much more
inventive, and the action sequences choreographed much more skilfully,
adding up to a much more thrilling time than what its predecessor
offered. Saving the best for last, Liebesman also crafts an epic finale
with a gigantic lava-spewing monster known as the Kronos that also
involves a whole legion led by warrior-queen Princess Andromeda
(Rosamund Pike). The victory call at the end may be a tad overdone, but
the climax alone is worth the price of admission and surprisingly
impressive even in post- converted 3D.<br /><br />Pity then that the rest of the movie often pales in comparison- and
perhaps the most jarring of all is the poorly defined interfamilial
conflict between Zeus, Hades and Aroes. Screenwriters Dan Mazeau and
David Leslie Johnson (working off a story that&#x27;s also credited to Greg
Berlanti) give Aroes little motivation behind his father&#x27;s betrayal
other than his envy of Perseus, nor do they manage the sibling tension
between Zeus and Hades convincingly. Worse still, they try to turn
Hades into a less straightforward character by casting him as a
reluctant pawn in Aroes&#x27; scheme midway into the movie, and the
subsequent reconciliation between Zeus and Hades is laughable even with
the considerable acting talents of Neeson and Fiennes.<br /><br />Certainly, both thespians are well aware of the thin material here, but
kudos to the pair for trying to imbue their Godly characters with the
gravitas they usually bring to their roles. Among the more interesting
additions to the cast are Bill Nighy as the loony weapons-maker
Hephaestus whom Perseus approaches for help to gain entry to the
underworld labyrinth Zeus is held captive, as well as Toby Kebbell as
Poseidon&#x27;s son Agenor and the only other character besides Hephaestus
to have a sense of humour in the entire movie.<br /><br />Indeed, the movie takes itself too seriously for its own good, ignoring
its own campy origins in favour of a self-serious sensibility to its
storytelling that only further exposes its plot and character flaws.
This is, and perhaps has always been, about watching Gods, demi-gods
and monsters go at each other with sound and fury- and thankfully, this
sequel easily betters its predecessor on this regard alone. That&#x27;s not
likely to be enough to make the Gods happy though, but for those of us
mortals looking for big-budget mind-numbing spectacle, this will do
just fine. <br /><br />- www.moviexclusive.com
