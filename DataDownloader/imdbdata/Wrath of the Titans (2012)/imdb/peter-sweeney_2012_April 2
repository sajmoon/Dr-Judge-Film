Totally really enjoyable movie and brilliant in 3d! Superb effects!
Disengage your brain, take in the diabolical liberty taken with these
Greek mythology characters. So much is given to perceived inaccuracies
in the movie about the &#x22;gods&#x22; real roles. Nobody knows anyway. All we
really know are their names and what they are Gods of....! <br /><br />These professional critics bang on about wooden acting - well really!
The acting is secondary to the special effects, and I thought they all
done a good job (with a slight reservation about Bill Nighy).<br /><br />Sam Worthington takes a lot of stick, so how come he seems to be in the
films i&#x27;ve enjoyed recently &#x22;man on a ledge&#x22;; &#x22;the two titans&#x22;;
&#x22;Avatar&#x22;. To me he is an excellent action actor and can express humour
e.g. his relationship with Pegasus. Pegasus taps him on the rear with
his wing in a surly manner.<br /><br />So yeah, the action moves unabatedly and builds to several climax
scenes.<br /><br />Have to say bit of a shame for Kronos that having been slumbering in
the underworld for limitless years, his time on earth, actually on the
ground, lasts approximately 10 minutes! - unlucky chap.
