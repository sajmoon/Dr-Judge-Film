2012_April 6 
I&#x27;ll start this by saying, I was disappointed with 2010&#x27;s &#x22;Clash of the
Titans.&#x22; Everyone was in their typecast roles, the script was hammy and
flat, and the action scenes -- the most valuable element of a summer
action blockbuster -- were hit or miss.<br /><br />HOWEVER, &#x22;Wrath of the Titans&#x22; does not suffer from those symptoms.
It&#x27;s an honest, to-the- point action film, that moves smoothly from
action scene to action scene with great pacing. It&#x27;s been a while since
I&#x27;ve watched a film that feels like an &#x22;adventure&#x22; -- and you get that
experience with a few of the film&#x27;s larger set pieces, particularly the
maze sequence. The adrenaline fun is balanced with good humor from Toby
Kebbell, who plays Agenor, Perseus&#x27;s cousin, and a reluctant hero with
a vibrant personality.<br /><br />Get your candy and your drug of choice, and go into this movie looking
for a good time. Don&#x27;t go in with bizarre movie expectations. This is
an action movie, it&#x27;s not out to deceive you that it&#x27;s more than that.
Enjoy Sam Worthington kicking some Titan ass and feel the WRATH OF THE
TITANS!!!
