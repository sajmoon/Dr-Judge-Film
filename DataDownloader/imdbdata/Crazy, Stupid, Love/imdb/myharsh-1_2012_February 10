Good date movies, or RomComs as they are called, are getting rarer
these days. Sure we&#x27;ve regular barrage of typical Jennifer Aniston and
Katherine Heigl movies, but a good RomCom, we haven&#x27;t seen in years.
The kind that peaked in 90s with Meg Ryan movies( You&#x27;ve got Mail,
Sleepless in Seattle), Love Actually, and Notting Hill. This is why
Crazy, Stupid, Love comes as a breathe of fresh air. It covers all the
basics. I know it is not realistic, but RomComs are not supposed to be
so. They are supposed to fill you with a bittersweet feeling, they&#x27;ve
to be in words of Notting Hill: &#x22;Surreal, but nice&#x22;. CSL is story of
Steve Carrell and Julianne Moore, as they try to fight their mid-life
crisis, story of Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, as they find love in one
night stands, and story of teenagers as they experience their first
love. And it goes beyond depicting love at different life stages; it
shows how they are inter-connected and love, despite of what is your
age, is just love. And finally music. Any good RomCom has a great score
and CSL is as previously mentioned, has a great score for a RomCom
after many, many years. Songs are beautifully woven in the fabric of
the movie. You begin to sense bitterness of a divorce in &#x22;Alamanc&#x22; and
ecstasy of a great closure in &#x22;Blood&#x22;. Shakespeare invented RomCom
genre with his plays. It has romantic element and is a comedy because
it ends with a positive closure for characters we&#x27;ve begun to love. CSL
is RomCom of true proportions, where comedy is not used as a cheap
selling point, but a smile on viewer&#x27;s face comes from the subtlety.
Here is where CSL scores. 10/10
