I so enjoyed this movie! The acting and writing were excellent and I
was very moved by the end. It was so enjoyable! In particular I loved
the long scene where Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling fell in love over the
course of an evening. They had amazing chemistry, she is really turning
out to be a terrific young actress. And he is always spot on. It was
wonderful. But everything was good! Sometimes Julianne Moore isn&#x27;t that
sympathetic to me but I enjoyed her here very much. The same for Steve
Carrell. This was his best work since the movie with Juliette Binoche
(I loved that one, too, DAN IN REAL LIFE). As opposed to some of the
gross out comedies of the summer, this one really trusted the
intelligence of the audience. I hope these filmmakers continue on.
