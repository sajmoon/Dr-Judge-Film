This movie will captivate you from the start, with its unusual story
and great performance&#x27;s, it will make you laugh, make you feel good,
make u enjoy every second of it, at least that was in my case. Every
penny that you spent on this movie is more than worth it, trust me, and
if u like this kind of movies, the only thing you will be sad about is
that you CANT WATCH this movie for the first time ever again.. Its that
original and funny, with an epic ending conclusion which will put a
smile on your face for a long time, you&#x27;ll be smiling even on your way
home. Actors did a really great job in concluding this masterpiece,
especially Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling spicing it up. I wish I had
Alzheimer&#x27;s so It gets new every time I watch it ;))) Joking aside,
really great cinema experience. 10/10, go and watch it.
