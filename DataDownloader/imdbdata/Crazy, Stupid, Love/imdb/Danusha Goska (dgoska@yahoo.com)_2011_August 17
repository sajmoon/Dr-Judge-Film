&#x22;Crazy Stupid Love&#x22; is funny, warm, well-made, and grow-up. Ryan
Gosling gives an Academy-Award winning performance as the lounge lizard
who outdoes all lounge lizards. There are unexpected, politically
incorrect, farcical moments, and at least one classic love scene that
did something no other love scene I&#x27;ve ever seen has done. I laughed
out loud and came close to crying. <br /><br />Emily (Julianne Moore) tells her husband, Cal (Steve Carell) that she
wants a divorce. Cal begs his wife to &#x22;stop talking.&#x22; When she keeps
talking, he throws his body out of a moving car. As a woman who has
tried to talk to men about serious issues, and been frustrated by their
occasional inability to respond, I loved that scene. <br /><br />I thought I knew where this movie would go. The movie surprised me. Its
biggest surprise was Ryan Gosling. Gosling has done nothing so far that
made me look twice. &#x22;The Notebook&#x22; was one of the blandest and most
forgettable movies I&#x27;ve ever seen, and his smaller movies tried too
hard. <br /><br />Gosling&#x27;s Jacob the Lounge Lizard is one of the funniest, sharpest,
subtlest performances I&#x27;ve ever seen. In every smarmy smile, in every
delivery of the hackneyed pickup line, &#x22;Do you want to get out of
here?&#x22; Gosling performs a razor-edge between dead serious and flat-out
parody. Jacob is both a big joke on bar bravado and an awed salute to
masculinity. Gosling demands that we grant Jacob the due of an alpha
male, as if he were a silverback gorilla &#x96; or Frank Sinatra &#x96; even
while he invites us to laugh uproariously at him. He&#x27;s Buddy Love on
steroids. And, finally, we are invited to see poignancy and even some
heartbreak. Even if I hated the surrounding film &#x96; and I did not &#x96; I&#x27;d
watch this movie again and again just to see Gosling in it. <br /><br />Robbie (Jonah Bobo) has an unquenchable crush on his baby sitter. I
kept waiting for the film to do something conventional with Robbie&#x27;s
love, but it never did &#x96; in fact it got a little weird &#x96; and I liked
that. When I was that age, I was capable of that kind of love. <br /><br />There is a tangle of subplots that weave together into a beyond-chance
farcical lawn party that made me laugh and cry at the same time. The
audience watches characters have their hearts ripped out, their dreams
and plans smashed &#x96; and yet has to laugh. What feels like death inside
of participants&#x27; hearts looks like a screwball ballet to observers. <br /><br />&#x22;Crazy Stupid Love&#x22; includes a quiet love scene that is worthy to
become a screen classic. It involves two cell phones and a pilot light.
This scene poignantly salutes what real, adult love really is, at its
best. Steve Carrel could not be better in this scene.
