After their ill-fated director debut, I LOVE YOU PHILLIP MORRIS (2009),
duo filmmakers Glenn Ficarra and John Requa comes back with this
sleeper hit in the lukewarm summer last year, it is a G-rated rom-com,
composed of run-of-the-mill scenarios, but exquisitely draws me head
over heels for it. <br /><br />It took 6 years for Steve Carell to upgrade his 40-year-old-virgin
status to a 44-year-old- loyal-husband honor, whose sexual object has
remained as singular form with his soulmate (then high-school
sweetheart, now the wife for 22 years, who is submerging into a
quotidian middle age crisis). Steve exudes a tremendous bent of
poker-face acting in this film, flavored with a whiff of sarcastic and
knowing jokes; it is also a delight to embrace Julianne Moore back to a
mainstream rom com since LAWS OF ATTRACTION (2004), her role is
well-measured and no one will ever doubt her capacity to be competent
for it. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone pair suffers from a shorter screen
time for their corresponding story about an invincible womanizer meets
the girl of his life; but Gosling has the qualification to stride
swaggeringly in the Hollywood now because his filmography proves that
he is the next George Clooney with a much earlier inception (judging
fairly by his three films coming in 2010). There are a third love
lateral in the film, a 13-year-old boy&#x27;s puppy love, could have been a
filler, but owing to youngster Jonah Bobo&#x27;s precocious strain, it
parallels immaculately with the main artery. Another two big names here
Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon, the former&#x27;s short appearance is the most
hysterical part of the film and the latter is unworthily
unprepossessing. <br /><br />Near &#x2154; of the film, there is a sterlingly concocted plot twist which
could be a gratifying surprise, which attests not only Dan Fogelman&#x27;s
well-structured script but Ficarra-Requa&#x27;s ingenuity as well, I have
seen a budding spark from this worn-out genre of Hollywood film
industry.
