Honestly as the years pass by, we can start telling which romantic
comedies have come to become romantic classics. Last time I saw one, it
was &#x22;The Holiday&#x22;, But &#x22;Crazy stupid love&#x22; has come to become one. <br /><br />Sofisticated humor, clever script writing, and great story lines, turn
this movie into a must see.<br /><br />A funny-sensitive Steve Carrel, a dazzling Julian Moore, a manly-
romantic Ryan Gossling and a smart-cute Emma Stone, make the perfect
lead cast; plus a very unique supporting cast spicing it up a little,
playing the children, the nanny, the best friends, and some people in
between the married couple&#x27;s relationship.<br /><br />Plus, be ready to get a few plot surprises, I assure you, you won&#x27;t be
expecting some of those.<br /><br />Although, if you&#x27;re expecting to laugh your ass off, and be sitting on
the edge of your seat exited about something amazing that&#x27;s about to
happen, you may get disappointed. Just relax, seat back, maybe prepare
a few tears, hold your couple tight, and you&#x27;re all set to enjoy this
clever romantic comedy.
