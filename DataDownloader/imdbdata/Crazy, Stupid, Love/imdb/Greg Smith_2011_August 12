CRAZY, STUPID, LOVE<br /><br />ONE LINE REVIEW: Engaging romantic comedy with a Shakespearian twist.<br /><br />RATING: See it in theaters. (rating system: &#x22;see it in theaters&#x22;, &#x22;wait
for the instant download&#x22;, &#x22;don&#x27;t waste your time&#x22;)<br /><br />NO SPOILERS<br /><br />The film opens with Cal (Steve Carell) being informed by his wife Emily
(Julianne Moore) that she wants a divorce. After 25 years of wedded
bliss that started in High School, this comes as a great shock to Cal.
He starts hanging out at a local bar where lounge lizard, local
slickster Jacob (Ryan Gosling) takes pity on our schlemiel and takes
him in hand to give him a make-over. Cal then goes on to bed 9 women
and turns into a slick dude himself.<br /><br />If this were any ordinary movie, the rest of the plot would be obvious.
It doesn&#x27;t give away too much to say that one of the women Cal conquers
turns out to be his son&#x27;s teacher (Marisa Tomei). In fact, the movie
plays very much along Hollywood formula lines that the non-Hollywood
ending is a complete surprise.<br /><br />I wish I could tell you more. But to do so would spoil the film for
you. Steve Carell is a master of the underplayed comedian. Julianne
Moore is lovely at age 50 (although she claims to be 44 in the film &#x96;
it is a comedy after all). Emma Stone is smart-sexy. And a special
appearance by Kevin Bacon was not unwelcome.<br /><br />You might &#x22;wait for the instant download&#x22; but I recommend you &#x22;see it
in theaters&#x22; because you won&#x27;t want to have the ending spoiled for you
around the water cooler.
