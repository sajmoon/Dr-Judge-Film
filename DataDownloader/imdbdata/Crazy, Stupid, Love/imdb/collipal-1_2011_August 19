After reading so many very positive reviews about Crazy, Stupid, Love,
I expected it to be a challenging deconstruction of the romantic
comedy, or at least a version with enough intelligence in order to make
it a remarkable film of the genre, reaching that weird combination of
genuinely funny comedy and sincere and credible romance. And I have to
say that Crazy, Stupid, Love certainly tried to achieve that;
unfortunately, its occasional deviations from the known formula, as
well as its unexpected encroachments of the habitual clich&#xE9;s made it
not be very satisfactory, despite having some positive elements.<br /><br />The main problem from Crazy, Stupid, Love is that its screenplay feels
imbalanced, due to the fact that it pays more attention to the &#x22;main&#x22;
romances while it ignores the supporting characters, which were more
interesting in my humble opinion. And something which does not help is
that those main romances frequently loose the course and tend to repeat
themselves due to their lack of a narrative impulse. For example: How
many times do we have to see Cal making a fool of himself in the bar?
We already understood it...he is weak and shy with women; let&#x27;s move
on, please. Meanwhile, even though I consider Ryan Gosling one of the
best contemporary actors, I found him antipathetic and not very
credible in this movie as the co-star. As for Julianne Moore, her huge
talent is wasted with a weakly written character.<br /><br />On the positive side, Steve Carell brings a solid performance, even
though it is not very different to his previous work. In fact, his
character in this movie is a combination of the boring husband he
interpreted in the comedy Date Night and the depressed loser from the
drama Dan in Real Life...something which is not bad at all. That simply
reveals the fact that Carell has the necessary range to go from the
comedy to the drama with fluidity, as long as the road between both
extremes does not go very far from his &#x22;comfortable area&#x22;. Emma Stone
also brings a competent work in this movie. However, my favorite
performances from Crazy, Stupid, Love were unexpectedly the ones from
Jonah Bobo and Analeigh Tipton, at the same time that their &#x22;romance&#x22;
(or romance attempt) was the most honest and emotive one from the whole
film. Unfortunately, their screen-time is reduced, but they both share
the best scene from Crazy, Stupid, Love, which was a breath of fresh
air after the various missteps the screenplay had committed before it.
Unfortunately, they both also share the WORST scene from the movie: a
classic &#x22;big romantic gesture&#x22; which supposedly solves it all, when in
fact, it made me angry for being such badly raised and executed.<br /><br />I was left with the impression that Crazy, Stupid, Love aspired to be a
hybrid of Love Actually and American Beauty, and no wonder that it
failed to achieve that very high ambition. However, at least it tried
it, and because of that and the fact that it kept me moderately
entertained, I think it deserves a slight recommendation. Nevertheless,
I would have mainly preferred a better balanced and more credible
screenplay, which did not fall into the clich&#xE9;s it tried to laugh at.
