I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to see this movie at the theater,but I am
really glad I did. The characters are well played out, not very likable
at first, but after you get to know the cast, you really feel for
everyone. I thought Julianne Moore &#x26; Steve Carrell had great chemistry
with their relationship. Super script, nice directing, great casting
with Robbie, the son. This movie will surprise you at how good it is. I
loved how you saw the characters at work, at home, at the bar &#x26; with
their friends. This was very well played out &#x26; comes together in the
end extremely well. Ryan Gosling is very hot even when he is sleazy.
Great date night movie!!
