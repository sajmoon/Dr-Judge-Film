Greetings again from the darkness. From the opening scene it is clear
we aren&#x27;t in for a typically lame rom-com with caricatures instead of
characters and punchlines instead of feelings. Instead, this one is all
about the characters and their feelings ... realistic feelings of pain,
anger, hope and frustration. Now don&#x27;t misunderstand. It doesn&#x27;t go too
deep and there is still plenty of humor in the moments.<br /><br />Cal (Steve Carell) and Emily (Julianne Moore) are sharing one of their
many restaurant moments over the course of their long, steady marriage.
Only this time, something spoils the comfort zone. Emily says she wants
a divorce and later tells Cal that she had an affair with a co-worker
(Kevin Bacon). What follows is as close to real life reactions as we
could ever hope for in a rom-com. Cal is hurt. The kids are angry.
Emily is confused. Their friends take sides.<br /><br />The intertwining story lines and characters are both sad and funny. We
see how people react when they are attracted to others ... or not. We
see how people react when they wonder if their decision was rash. We
see how basically nice people try to do the right thing for themselves
and others, but still mess it up sometimes.<br /><br />After moving out, Cal heads to a local upscale lounge that seems to be
stocked with gorgeous women and only a handful of men ... every night.
In real life, the line of men waiting to enter would be wrapped around
the block. Still, one of the regulars is Jacob, played by Ryan Gosling.
He is a thing of beauty to look at it and always quick with just the
right line. His science is making women believe he cares about nothing
but them. Cal is discouraged by Jacob&#x27;s incredible success rate. Jacob
notices Cal&#x27;s negative vibe and agrees to train him. But first, the
makeover ... wardrobe, haircut and conversation skills.<br /><br />The polar opposite effect of what you might expect from Hollywood -
these nice people begin to question their direction. Cal longs for
Emily. Emily still thinks about Cal, but dates her co-worker. The son
(Jonah Bobo) has a crush on the older baby-sitter, who has a crush of
her own. Even Jacob falls hard for new attorney Hannah (Emma Stone) who
has just walked out on her wet rag boyfriend (Josh Groban) who offered
her a job, rather than a ring. Oh what a tangled web we weave. And
that&#x27;s just the stuff I can tell you! Cal&#x27;s first conquest utilizing
his newly learned skills is a teacher played with full energy by the
terrific Marisa Tomei. She only has a couple of scenes, but as usual,
Ms. Tomei makes the most of her screen time. The baby sitter is played
well by Analeigh Tipton, but it&#x27;s interesting to note (in real life)
she is 3 days younger than law school grad Hannah (Stone).<br /><br />All of the actors are top notch here. Steve Carell continues to get
better ... this is a superior movie to Date Night (with Tina Fey).
Julianne Moore is solid, though her character is mostly mopey. Ryan
Gosling and Emma Stone are both outstanding. Gosling is none for mostly
offbeat, dark independent films but shows again how easily he slides
back into sex symbol. Ms. Stone is headed for super-stardom. She was
really good in Easy A and has a star-making turn in the upcoming film
The Help. After that, it&#x27;s on to the new Spider-Man for her.<br /><br />Glenn Ficarra and John Requa are the co-directors and were responsible
for the much less mainstream I Love You Phillip Morris, with Jim Carrey
and Ewan McGregor. Surprisingly the film was written by Dan Fogelman,
who is known for his script writing on the animated Cars movies.<br /><br />No question women will enjoy the film, but the surprise is, many men
will relate to what&#x27;s going on with the Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling
characters. There is enough humor to keep everyone happy and enough
strong writing to say this is a very good movie.
