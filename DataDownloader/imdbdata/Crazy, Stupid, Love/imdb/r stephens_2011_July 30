This is a slow, depressing, very disjointed movie. It is not romantic
and other than a great scene with Marisa Tomei, it is not a comedy.<br /><br />Carrell and Moore are hardly seen for the middle 70 minutes or so of
the movie; rather the movie inexplicably focuses on the extremely
creepy friend of the Carrell character.<br /><br />The movie hops from scene to scene with no real segue and no emotional
ties develop to any character.<br /><br />The first 90 minutes are a brutal bore. Thankfully it does come
together in a mildly humorous development toward the end, but 90
minutes of sheer boredom is too great a price to pay
