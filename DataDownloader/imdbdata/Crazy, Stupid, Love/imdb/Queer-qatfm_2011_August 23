I&#x27;ve been looking forward to Crazy, Stupid, Love for a couple of months
now. While the TV Spots haven&#x27;t been very good, the extended trailers
seemed to promise a real visceral and gut busting romantic comedy that
was full of heart and laughs. I&#x27;ve been yearning for a nice drama I
could rally behind in the midst of the Summer Movie Experience&#x99; but
unfortunately that&#x27;s not quite what I got here.<br /><br />Steve Carell plays Cal, the sort of hub which all the other players
revolve around. There&#x27;s Julianne Moore who&#x27;s divorcing him, Ryan
Gosling who mentors him, Kevin Bacon who replaces him, Jonah Bobo who&#x27;s
his son and looks up to him (but is obviously not important enough to
be included on the poster in spite of being about 1/3 of the movie&#x27;s
focus) and then there is Emma Stone who plays a role along side Ryan&#x27;s
character and more, but that&#x27;ll be kept secret for spoiler concerns.<br /><br />It&#x27;s a stacked cast, to be sure. It&#x27;s too bad that most of them aren&#x27;t
very funny. Carell tries his improvisational routine which often really
only means he keeps repeating the same phrase over and over using
different weird voices. It&#x27;s clearly one of the only comedy tools he
knows and was best used during the superior film 40 Year Old Virgin.
The fact he&#x27;s pared with Ryan Gosling makes little since, but what&#x27;s
even more shocking is just how much funnier Gosling ends up being in
comparison. Even Emma Stone seems to miss her funny mark in this near
disaster which eventually pulls out madcap hijinks when the whole time
it&#x27;s been more of a mental comedy. And then when it comes to the
sincere moments none of the actors except for Julianne More really pull
it off. I guess they all just wanted to do what they&#x27;re known for and
not really that well.<br /><br />The whole thing is overloaded. There is bloated and disjointed plot
everywhere. Too many characters who have too much that needs to be done
so they can wrap it all up in a neat bow a number of times in the
overextended denouncement. Kevin Bacon is a good example of this. There
is no real good reason he&#x27;s in this picture. His character could have
been just referenced and left off camera since he adds nothing to the
show. Simiarily, Marisa Tomei&#x27;s crazed school teacher role seems like
it belongs in another movie entirely. She provides such a jarring clash
of misfit comedy that doesn&#x27;t work here. And after those parts are cut,
a general overall snippy snip snip would have helped tighten things up
as well.<br /><br />So really what we have here is a romantic comedy that is not nearly as
romantic or funny enough. It&#x27;s too long. It&#x27;s too populated. And
doesn&#x27;t seem to know just how crazy or stupid or lovely it wants to be.
To be honest, other than some nice scenes here and there (Ryan giving
Steve a manly make over was in the trailer) the only real satisfying
storyline is that of Hal&#x27;s son and his crush on his babysitter. But
even that gets a kind of disturbing conclusion.
