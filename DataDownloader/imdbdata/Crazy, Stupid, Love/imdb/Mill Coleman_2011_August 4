My initial reaction is that this film is the best romantic comedy that
I&#x27;ve seen in years. The genre has been pretty devoid of quality lately.
So, I don&#x27;t know if that plays a part or not and I really don&#x27;t care at
this point. I enjoyed everything about this movie. It has tremendous
heart and charisma and it&#x27;s so very easy to get caught up in to the
lives of these characters. A certain degree of patience is required
while viewing because some secondary characters that feel unnecessary
to the story are worth getting to know. Steve Carell&#x27;s character is the
one everyone empathizes with and when the movie shifts away from the
&#x22;A&#x22; story you wonder why and start to think that the &#x22;B&#x22; story is going
to be muddled or clich&#xE9; or one to endure. Well, they&#x27;re not and
everything comes together in a wonderful fashion. The entire cast here
is perfection. The overall message may be one to debate but it doesn&#x27;t
matter because the ride and this film are just so smart and so well
done.
