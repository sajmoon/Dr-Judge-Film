7.6? Have you all gone mad? This movie sucked. I laughed about 3 times.<br /><br />Painful to watch. As with all romantic comedies, once it hits the
dreaded one hour mark, go away because the &#x22;comedy&#x22; part goes and is
replaced by the &#x22;romance&#x22;.<br /><br />In other words zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.<br /><br />And the first 50 minutes were no prize either.<br /><br />If you are a straight male, do not be convinced by your significant (or
insignificant) other to endure this crap.<br /><br />If you want to see something funny have haven&#x27;t seen before, go rent
Saxondale. Or see The UK version of The Office again.<br /><br />Americans make comedy. Britian makes humour.<br /><br />The jokes in Crazy, Stupid Love were so obvious and predictable, I was
covering my head with a blanket to stop the agony.<br /><br />I remember when my baby had an infection and she was pooping all over
the place. Cleaning that up was more fun than watching this movie.
Because after 20 minutes, you were done. This just kept on going on and
on and on.
