Crazy Stupid Love, was an okay movie. It wasn&#x27;t as funny as I thought
it would be but it did have a good plot. They should remove the genre
of &#x22;Comedy&#x22; from the movie because it&#x27;s a normal drama with different
love stories along with a few funny parts, just like any other movie.
My favorite character in this movie was Jessica (Emma Stone), she&#x27;s a
great actress and played her roll very well. She and Ryan Gosling&#x27;s
chemistry was actually believable. I love how the two completely
different stories link together towards the middle and end. I would
recommend this movie to anyone who likes a drama film as well as a
funny story line, plot and cast members.
