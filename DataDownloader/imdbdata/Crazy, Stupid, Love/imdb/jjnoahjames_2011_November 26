Synopsis; Unique love relationship stories told with a whole bunch of
famous acts you already know. It works.<br /><br />Awesome; Script, good acting, actually funny at times, tough moral
lessons learned, great soundtrack, actors enjoyable despite being so
overused. Both types of fans of comedy should enjoy this. Marisa Tomei
still kicking it strong here. Almost reminds me of a Spanish actress.<br /><br />Poop; You might not like how it&#x27;s almost all famous actors, risqu&#xE9;
scene and situation (I don&#x27;t personally like this). Could be worst. <br /><br />Overall a really great film! I could probably watch this again with
friends.
