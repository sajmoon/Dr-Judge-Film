You know usually I&#x27;m not into romantic comedies, as I find that most of
them fall short &#x26; are extremely cheesy. I really liked this movie
though. One of the great things about it, is the acting is great.
Everyone plays their part perfectly and you actually kind of feel for
them in their individual situations. Usually when I think of Steve
Carell, I think of a jokester. He was great in his serious scenes
though, very believable. And Ryan Gosling, Oh my goodness, Ryan
Gosling. He has always been one of my favorite actors. He plays a
ladies man in this movie, trying to get Carell back on his feet after
splitting with his wife. The two of them have great chemistry together
and provide plenty of laughs, along with touching moments. I just saw
this movie yesterday and I already want to see it again. That almost
never happens that I want to see a movie again right away. Very cute.
This movie has a little bit of everything and I think that most people
would enjoy it. 9/10!
