2011_August 2 
A hugely talented cast wasted in a movie that wanders like a drunken
cow on a highway. One can buy the initial premise, of a boring and
predictable office worker (Carell), taken in hand by a predatory Romeo
(Gosling) and turned into a a playboy after Carell&#x27;s wife (Moore) asks
for a divorce. Alas, alas, this movie has so many subplots and
unnecessary complications one gets the feeling that a bunch of scenes
from other movies were simply dropped into a Cuisinart and taken for a
spin. Nothing seems to hang together. The eminently watchable Emma
Stone appears to be performing in another movie for all the
relatability her character has to the main plot. One sits there baffled
as to why she is in this movie (although having said that, she is an
absolute delight to watch -- and the reason this viewer went to see
this flick!) Admitted, there is a final payoff for her character --
totally unbelievable -- but the interminable journey to get there is
exasperating. As is another subplot between Carrell&#x27;s underage son and
his baby sitter that leaves one longing to fast forward every time
either character shows up. The acting talent on display here is
wonderful but oh, what a waste in a godawful script. (And did I mention
Kevin Bacon and Marisa Tomei? Both woefully underused, drowned out by
the surplus of subplots.) This is a stinker of a movie kept afloat by
the sheer talent of the actors involved.
