Aside from an occasionally inspired moment or two from Marisa Tomei,
this movie is an unstructured, poorly-scripted, badly-edited waste of
some very talented people&#x27;s time. Steve Carell took it upon himself to
shepherd this to fruition quite unwisely -- maybe he should think long
and hard about the material he wants to bring to the screen. Between
this and &#x22;Dinner For Schmucks,&#x22; he&#x27;s done a poor job of working the
post-&#x22;Office&#x22; movie angle. The script left no hint as to what anyone
was feeling, and we had to take it on face value what was going on in
the characters&#x27; heads. We were never given a clue as to whether we
should like Carell, Gosling, Moore, Bacon, etc. I don&#x27;t know how you
get anything this wrong.<br /><br />Oh, and Julianne Moore was miscast.
