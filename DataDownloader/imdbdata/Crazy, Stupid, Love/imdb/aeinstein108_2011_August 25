As I was watching this I kept thinking to myself that this might be
pretty good if I had brain damage. Mindless and idiotic. Stay away
unless you want to punish yourself. Since I have to write 10 lines in
order for a review to be posted on this site I guess I need to say
more. The target audience for this movie appears to be 12 year old
girls or any males who are very feminine. The whole movie is just a
repeat of other boy/girl love stories with a faint attempt at, what the
writer must have thought, was humor. The quality of the acting is right
up there with middle school thespian attempts. The music and
cinematography is also at a level that would appeal to young teenage
girls. Honestly I don&#x27;t know how any of the adults in this film can
stand to look at themselves in the mirror without being embarrassed
after performing in this film. I guess the nice pay checks help to ease
their pain. Truly awful.
