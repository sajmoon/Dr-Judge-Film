This is not an all time great in the overall category but for the
ROM-com genre it really is one of the best. The difficulty with making
a good ROM-com is that it is difficult to stray away form the
formulaic, and this is not exactly a new type of ROM-com. This film
combines a mixture of a quick and witty script, fantastic performances
and a story that is actually engrossing. Cal (Steve Carell) is stumped
when his wife Emily (Julianne Moore) asks for a divorce seemingly out
of the blue. He goes through stages of depression until he is
approached in a bar by Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a serial womaniser who
takes pity on Cal and offers to spruce him up and bring back the
confidence and manliness that Cal has lost over the years. This is a
clich&#xE9; but I really don&#x27;t want to say anymore as you need to watch it
basically blind (and the trailer in my opinion gave too much away). I
rarely laugh out loud while watching a film and it does take quite a
lot to make me laugh but I found this film absolutely hilarious and at
the same time very heartfelt. This has to be accredited to, as
previously mentioned, the script and acting. Steve Carell was perfect.
He steered away from his typical &#x22;Steve Carell&#x22; type character in this
role a lot more than usual and possessed streaks of brilliance.
Julianne Moore was very good as expected. Ever since &#x22;A Single Man&#x22; the
actress has been on fire. But what can you say about Ryan Gosling? He
is a incredible talent who is getting bigger and bigger every year. His
presence was felt throughout the film and he put in the kind of
performance when you missed him when he wasn&#x27;t on. Emma Stone did very
well but her part was sadly too small. The youngest member of the cast
put in a really memorable performance portraying first love which was
both nostalgic and very funny. Seriously watch this.
