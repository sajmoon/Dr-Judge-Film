This movie is close to perfect, when it comes to a romantic movie,
which also succeeds in being funny and witty at the same time, without
one of them being too much. <br /><br />I sat down and watched this with my expectations kind of high, after
hearing about it, and watching trailers etc.<br /><br />The movie starts off fast and you&#x27;re captured by the very first
minutes. The story throughout the movie is great, and the plot is funny
and well-thought. You cannot do anything else than loving this movie
because it has so much heart and personality. <br /><br />Sometimes a romantic movie can be too corny or too crazy and too stupid
to love. Yes, this is &#x22;Crazy, Stupid, Love&#x22; but it has the perfect
amount of each of those things to satisfy someone who&#x27;s looking for a
movie to laugh at, love and enjoy.<br /><br />This is without a doubt one of the best romantic comedies in quite a
while, so you should definitely go see it, and if you already have,
then watch it again!
