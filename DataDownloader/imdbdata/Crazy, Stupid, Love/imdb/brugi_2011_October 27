First feeling after watching a movie was that it was overrated. Then
I&#x27;ve realized: &#x22;Hey, what could one expect from a romantic comedy?&#x22;
Considering that I&#x27;m not into this genre, this was pretty watchable and
quality movie. Those who like the genre will certainly love it.<br /><br />The acting is great and they really got into characters well,
especially Steve. The story is somewhat fresh, although occasionally
unbelievable and even slightly inappropriate. It isn&#x27;t quite hilarious,
but contains certain amount of subtle and &#x22;smart&#x22; (or &#x22;mute&#x22;) humor
that I particularly appreciate. On the other hand, some scenes are too
slow for what they offer, while some others could use more emphasizing.<br /><br />All in all, I&#x27;m giving this move a 7, which is pretty good from me. :)
