Taking a new twist on the classic romantic comedy, &#x22;Crazy, Stupid,
Love.&#x22; features an all-star cast including Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling,
Emma Stone, Julianne Moore, Marisa Tomei, Kevin Bacon, and 13-year-old
Jonah Bobo. The film starts with Carell portraying Cal who is getting a
divorce after his wife Emliy, portrayed by Julianne Moore, cheats on
him with Kevin Bacon. Now single and hopeless, Cal gets advice from
professional bachelor Jacob Palmer, portrayed by Ryan Gosling, to
become a ladies bachelor. Then the story leads into unexpected moments,
hilarious clich&#xE9;s, and some heartwarming messages. Now, I have to say
that &#x22;Crazy, Stupid, Love.&#x22; is easily one of the best movies of the
year. The script is beautifully well-written, and Dan Fogelman does an
excellent job of visioning his script to the screen. Directors Glenn
Ficarra and John Requa do magnificent work by creating a unique romance
with lots of great camera work and writing. Now speaking about the
cast, Steve Carell does a brilliant job in this movie, and he&#x27;s one of
those characters where you want them to succeed. Ryan Gosling brings a
sexy, golden attitude to his performance, and he delivers in every
scene he is in. Wonderful as always, Julianne Moore delivers yet
another satisfying performance. Emma Stone was completely awesome in
this movie, and she really stands out. Marisa Tomei was pretty funny as
the psycho-insane teacher. But, Kevin Bacon was okay as Julianne
Moore&#x27;s affair lover, but they neither share any great chemistry
together. It&#x27;s the scenes between Carell and Moore that make the movie
stand out. But, out of all the cast, Jonah Bobo made me laugh the most
as Carell&#x27;s love-struck son, and he&#x27;s my absolute favorite role in the
movie. In a year filled with rated-R raunchy comedies, 3-D animated
features, and box-office fantasies, &#x22;Crazy, Stupid, Love.&#x22; is neither
of that, but instead, a fresh and unique comedy that delivers heart
warmth, clich&#xE9; moments that really work, and laugh-out-loud humor,
since all the laughs in the movie are deserving. Let&#x27;s also not forget
that the final twist in the movie, without revealing any spoilers, is
both funny and unexpected. With a charming script and wonderful cast,
&#x22;Crazy, Stupid, Love.&#x22; is not just one of the best comedies of the
year, but it&#x27;s also one of the best movies of the year. &#x22;Crazy, Stupid,
Love.&#x22;, in my review, &#x22;a fun and delightful romantic comedy&#x22;.
