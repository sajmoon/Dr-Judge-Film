I will admit from opening bell, that I do enjoy sappy love movies. It
was a movie that made you laugh,cry,wonder and cover your eyes. Steve
keeps true to his on screen character and his own real life strength
but never forgetting to mumble some sort of funny line even in his most
&#x22;sappy-est&#x22; of moments. I give this movie two thumbs up for its twist
at the end and keeping it out of viewers sights so well! I do however
wish that they would have developed a little more back story with
Ryan&#x27;s character but still, a movie to be enjoyed by all. Emma delivers
some nice side humor along with her friend in the movie as well! I
believe Steve may have surpassed expectations of his ability to play
that main love role and still maintain his &#x22;funny guy&#x22; image.
