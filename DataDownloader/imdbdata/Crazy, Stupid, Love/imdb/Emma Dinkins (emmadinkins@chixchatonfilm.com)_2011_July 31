I am always in favor of a good comedic family drama and thought that
this one looked as good as any. I was also interested in this story
because it struck an accord with someone such as I, who has been
married for more than two decades, and begs the question where can it
go wrong? Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) has reached a comfortable
complacent point in his life when he is then blindsided by his wife
Emily (Julianne Moore), as seen in the trailer, with her declaration of
wanting a divorce and her confession of a transgression. I have seen
Despicable Me so many times now with my grandson Three, that when I see
Steve Carell all I can think about is Gru, yes sad but true. I digress.
The situation with Cal and Emily leads to Cal spending a lot of time in
a bar where he then meets Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gossling) a slick
womanizing pretty boy. I was not convinced by the whole premise that
led to Jacob and Cal bonding, but decided not to give it too much
thought. But the fact of the matter is that if Jacob were as self
absorbed as he was shown to be he would not have given Cal two minutes
of thought, let alone try to help him deal with his circumstances. The
most endearing character throughout this whole movie was Robbie (Jonah
Bobo). I loved his determination and his honesty regarding how he felt
about Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), it was so adorable. And he was right
about the four year age difference in a few years it would make no
difference at all. I found myself after sitting through approximately
forty minutes of this film, slumped down in my seat, yawning while I
wondered where it was headed and then started to think about the
Whodini song, When We Gonna Get To The Good Part, Get Down To The Good
Part. And finally we did get to the good part, when all the
outlandishness and asinine behavior brought everything together. And to
be perfectly honest I did not see it coming. I sat up took interest
once more and thought that the film had taken a very clever turn. I
liked the bottom half of the film, but I felt as if the top half was
overindulged. I give this film an amber light for taking so long to get
to the good part.
