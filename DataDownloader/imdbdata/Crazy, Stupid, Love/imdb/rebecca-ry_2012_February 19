This film surprised me, despite liking most of the actors in it I
always assumed this would be another cheesy chick-flick with some gags
thrown in but, it was so much better!<br /><br />The script is simply great. Nearly every actor in this film performs
well and it is obvious they all got along well whilst filming. The
roles of Julianne Moore and Steve Carell worked well but I particularly
liked scenes with Ryan Gosling and Carell talking in the bar because
there are some points where you can see they are both trying to hold in
laughter and I love seeing that in films. I like to know they enjoyed
acting as much as I enjoyed watching this film. <br /><br />Towards the end of the film it begins to get cheesy but not to the
point where you start to lose interest. There are some genuine
laugh-out-loud moments in this film and it can leave you in tears with
some comedy sequences. <br /><br />Emma Stone&#x27;s role in this was probably the best. She was hilarious as
usual in this with her storyline being quite bizarre. That was my main
objection to this film, everyone&#x27;s storyline was great or at least
really funny despite being unbelievable but, the story between Carell
and Moore&#x27;s son and his babysitter was just ludicrous. Not even funny,
at some points it was just awkward watching it - especially at the end.
I of course will not give anything away but it is the main factor of
this film which wasn&#x27;t really needed, it did provide some laughs but it
got to the point where you just didn&#x27;t want to see them in the film at
all.<br /><br />Overall, this is a really good film. It&#x27;s been a while since I saw a
really good girl&#x27;s film. I would recommend it to those who like
comedies but particularly romantic comedies. If you don&#x27;t like that
genre then maybe this film isn&#x27;t for you but you will still laugh at
some parts.
