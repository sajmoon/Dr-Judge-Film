I feel compelled to write as I can&#x27;t believe the rating this movie has.
We&#x27;ve seen it all before many times and this movie brings nothing new.
OK let me begin, the first 40 minutes are funny, if it ended there it
would be 10, Carrell &#x26; Gosling give good performances and really gel as
a duo but like so many comedies it loses it&#x27;s way and the mid section
drags only to find that the finale is a big sentimental schmaltz that
really shouldn&#x27;t be present in a comedy. Why do American comedies
always do this (Sandler, Carrey)? It&#x27;s better than Just go with it, it
couldn&#x27;t be any worse!, and the performances are all first rate, it&#x27;s
just a pity the project is wanting.
