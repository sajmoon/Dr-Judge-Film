It would be a good movie if it weren&#x27;t for its indecision between being
a funny movie and a serious sentimental one. But anyway it has enough
of both features to make it agreeable to watch though on the whole it
has too many funny scenes to be considered serious and too many serious
scenes to be considered funny. But it has some witty dialogues and a
few powerful sentimental scenes along with funny ones. The story tells
us about a few crossed love situations: a 13 year old boy in love with
his 17 year old babysitter who is herself in love with the boy&#x27;s
father, a husband and a wife who seem to be on the verge of a divorce
which appears not to be wished by the husband and maybe also not fully
for the wife despite of her confessed adultery, a husband who tries to
take lessons of seduction from a professional philanderer and a few
confusing situations that finish with a great surprise in the end. In
sum a pleasant but not too ambitious movie.
