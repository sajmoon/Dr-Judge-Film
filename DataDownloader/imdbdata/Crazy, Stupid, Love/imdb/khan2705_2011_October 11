At fortysomething, straight-laced Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) is living
the dream-good job, nice house, great kids and marriage to his high
school sweetheart. But when Cal learns that his wife, Emily (Julianne
Moore), has cheated on him and wants a divorce, his &#x22;perfect&#x22; life
quickly unravels. Worse, in today&#x27;s single world, Cal, who hasn&#x27;t dated
in decades, stands out as the epitome of un-smooth. Now spending his
free evenings sulking alone at a local bar, the hapless Cal is taken on
as wingman and prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; to handsome, thirtysomething player Jacob Palmer
(Ryan Gosling).<br /><br />Starring, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore, Emma Stone,
Marisa Tomei , Jonah Bobo , Beth Littleford , John Carroll Lynch ,
Kevin Bacon , Analeigh Tipton , Joey King , Liza Lapira , Josh Groban.<br /><br />Directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, directors of I Love You,
Phillip Morris.<br /><br />well here it is a Romantic comedy drama which actually is somewhat
romantic, has comedy and drama. i was really looking forward to this
movie after the very good response by both audience and critics. i am
not saying i was disappointed or something but it just wasn&#x27;t what i
was expecting or i thought. it never gets Crazy as the title suggests,
it is not stupid but definitely has love. it is crazy in a way that all
the characters have some really crazy life situations and things going
on, yes in that way it is crazy. it has every type of love, i mean love
at first site, lost love, ever lasting love, crushes and everything
else like that.movie starts off very well but after the first half, it
gets really bellow average.<br /><br />i see more maturity in the direction from their last too silly and too
weird I Love You, Phillip Morris. they have progressed i think. this
movie could have been something of a big and lovely movie but it is too
forgettable. it never even tries to be clever or smart. the characters
were too self absorbed and the whole movie was too phony for me. that
usually bothers me. i wished they looked at actual people&#x27;s life more
closer and should have observed more clearer than they did to get this
movie. they really looked like people from another planets, aliens, i
couldn&#x27;t connect to them or understand their feelings.<br /><br />Steve Carell as Cal is a man who finds his wife Emily, Julianne Moore
cheated on him with her Coworker David played by Kevin Bacon and she
demands divorce. Cal starts frequents visit to a bar every night after
he moves out of the house. he yells his sad story to everyone loud.
Jacob, played by Ryan Gosling kind of notices him and decides to help
him. he himself is really dashing and womanizer king of a guy who knows
Tips To The Trade. the trade being bedding a girl every night with
simple talks and gestures. he gets him a whole look and wardrobe
change, starts meeting girls like him and the story continues to a
rather nice and sweet end. their is Emma Stone playing Hannah, a law
student who rejects Jacob at first but falls for him. and other arcs
too but not gonna get into that.<br /><br />when the reviews first started rolling in, everyone was just talking
about Ryan Gosling. i really agree with the fact that his whole
persona, the look, the attitude and his comic performance was nothing
but a treat. he really was someone who is a Fairy Godmother type
figure, a very too fantasy like. he is not someone you will find around
you easily. Ryan looked super hot and really good in this movie. i am
not a big Steve Carell fan but he really impressed me with his
depiction of this character. he could have played it like a dead dull
man with everything lost and too all over the place guy but he managed
to keep a certain amount of balance in his performance with some comic
approach to it and being the way he is. he was someone that was very
believable to me among the entire characters. Julianne Moore once again
plays someone who cries and yells and whines a lot. she always performs
too over the top for me, i think she always was overrated. her
character was someone you really want to go and slap her. Kevin Bacon
did a nice job, he wasn&#x27;t much in the movie but like a nice addition to
the cast.<br /><br />Emma Stone is one gorgeous girl, she is really someone who has good
comic timings and pulls romantic comedies very well. you have lately
seen her like in every movie. she did nice, nothing great. Marisa Tomei
as the teacher of Cal&#x27;s son was nice too. i loved that crazy scene when
Cal brings her to his apartment and moreover the Parent Teacher Meeting
one where she gets really crazy. i laughed so hard at her, her
expressions and the whole attitude was seriously hilarious.<br /><br />there are some moments in the movie which really are touching, very
few. it has some hilarious scenes that made me laugh. the pacing was
slow which was something i liked but the way movie itself was moving
was something i didn&#x27;t liked. so it had Screenplay problems, that ruins
everything. Editing was not done well. everything else was okay in it.<br /><br />its not a high recommendation from me but you might like or even in
some way love it, it maybe intoxicating for you too. it is a nice take
on romantic comedy drama movies that needed much more than what it got
but you still like it for everything it had and have good time.
