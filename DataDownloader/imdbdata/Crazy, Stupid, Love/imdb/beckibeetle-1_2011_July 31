This is the second movie I have ever walked out of. (The first one was
&#x22;Reds,&#x22; which I went to with my Mom, and it was just too long for her -
we left at Intermission.) So, it&#x27;s the first movie I made the choice to
walk out of. <br /><br />It was over the line at times, like when one high-school girl advises
another how she can pursue having sex with a friend&#x27;s father, but
mainly simply tedious, slow and going nowhere. None of the characters
were likable enough to care what happened to them next or how it ended.
Too bad Steve left The Office...<br /><br />My favorite thing about the movie was the couple&#x27;s backyard, which says
a lot. Maybe they should have had a talking dog in it or something. Ha
ha.
