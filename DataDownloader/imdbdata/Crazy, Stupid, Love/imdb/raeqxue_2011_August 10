The love in Crazy, Stupid, Love is not that crazy. But the movie is
kinda stupid indeed. After watching the trailer, I thought I was gonna
see a romantic comedy that can actually tell me something about love.
However, it didn&#x27;t touch me or tell me anything at all. Especially the
directors completely loses control of the movie when Emma Stone brings
Ryan Gosling to parents. I&#x27;m giving 4 points. For the first one, it&#x27;s
the minimum for a movie. The second one for the director telling a
story. Nowadays a lot of filmmakers even fail at this part. The third
point goes to Steve Carell and Julianne Moore for their chemistry while
they totally don&#x27;t look like a couple in person. The last one is given
to Ryan Gosling for being so hot. As for Emma Stone, I had a lot of
expectations for her. But she still looks like the high school girl
from Easy A and not attractive at all. Ryan is just too sexy for her.
Anyway, it&#x27;s still a good movie to kill time.
