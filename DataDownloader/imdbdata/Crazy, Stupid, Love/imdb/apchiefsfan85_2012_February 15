This movie at first I thought was going to try too hard to be funny.
However, it was way better than I ever expected. It has the perfect
blend of comedy, drama, and romance. The best performance would have to
be Ryan Gosling playing Jacob. There are no weak links in the movie
though. The plot flowed nicely with very few holes. The soundtrack has
a very good mix. The lighting and editing were both top notch. There
were a few moments where the acting was over the top but really didn&#x27;t
take away from the movie.The ending wasn&#x27;t all that great but that&#x27;s
the only reason I really took 1 star away from my rating. This movie is
perfect for a laugh and a movie that isn&#x27;t too predictable.
