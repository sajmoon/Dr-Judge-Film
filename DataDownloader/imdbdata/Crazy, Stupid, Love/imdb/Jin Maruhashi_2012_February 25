Realistic in its unpolished perspective towards love and uniquely
entertaining in its raw, disorganized humor, &#x22;Crazy, Stupid, Love&#x22;
strays far from being a regurgitation of all other artificially sweet
romantic comedies by a considerable amount. As predicted, Steve Carell
adds his one-of-a-kind, awkwardly amusing touch that goes so well in
practically any comedy, this one not being an exception. Steve Carell&#x27;s
goofy attractiveness, conjugated with the more gallant and serious mien
demonstrated by Ryan Gosling adds a pleasantly balanced overall mood to
the film. &#x22;Crazy, Stupid, Love&#x22;, unlike most others in its category,
centers its focus on both the blissful side and utterly disgruntled and
havoc-filled side as well, such an encompassing approach is what yields
the positive differential that sets it apart and incorporates an added
level of excitement.
