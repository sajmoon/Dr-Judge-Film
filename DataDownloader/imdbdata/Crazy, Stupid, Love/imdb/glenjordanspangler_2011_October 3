Some comments on movie websites quote Jacob&#x27;s lines and complain of
sexism. I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s a big difference between portraying something
and being something, but the message boards are missing a more
interesting point.<br /><br />Here, let&#x27;s imagine the genders of Crazy, Stupid, Love reversed:
CALLIE: My husband just left me, and he slept with some woman at the
office! JACKIE: Well, it&#x27;s no wonder: you&#x27;ve certainly let yourself go.
I&#x27;m going to make you over and teach you how to get into a man&#x27;s pants
more effectively. You know, rediscover your femininity.<br /><br />It&#x27;s unfair, though, to attack a screenplay for making nonjudgmental
observations about human nature. Better to first address the accuracy
of each problematic point, in case it isn&#x27;t the words themselves that
offend you, but the truth of them.<br /><br />Is it true, then, that we&#x27;re obligated to court our spouses tirelessly,
for the rest of our lives, because they&#x27;re &#x22;only human&#x22; and may
&#x22;stray?&#x22; Is counting on them to remain faithful on your bad hair days
the same as taking them for granted? If &#x22;working late&#x22; comes to mean
&#x22;exchanging bodily fluids with Jamie from accounting,&#x22; is it the
cheater&#x27;s fault for cheating? Is it your fault for working too many
Saturdays, getting flabby from lack of exercise, wearing the wrong
shoes and forgetting to compliment your spouse on wearing the right
shoes? Is your spouse at fault for failing to love and cherish you no
matter how rotten your teeth have become and how bad you smell? Do you
share the blame equally? Or is &#x22;fault&#x22; a useless concept in a
struggling marriage in which you&#x27;re both flawed, make mistakes and
blah, blah, blah? <br /><br />--from my review at www.1man365movies.com
