Looking at all the plot contrivances in &#x22;Crazy, Stupid Love,&#x22; I can&#x27;t
believe I found this movie so engaging and believably. I don&#x27;t much
care for Steve Carell, nor did I find his character very likable or
sympathetic. Julianne Moore, while a fine actress, is not one of my
favorites, either. However, the ensemble cast is good, especially Ryan
Gosling, Emma Stone, Analeigh Tipton, Jonah Bobo and, in an incredibly
thankless role, Marisa Tomei, that I found myself carried along by this
broad, sometimes farcical story.Writer Dan Fogelman&#x27;s screen is so
eccentric, it drew me away from obvious conclusions with snappy
dialogue and directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa make no mistakes,
as even one would have caused &#x22;Crazy, Stupid Love&#x22; to come crashing
down.<br /><br />Some don&#x27;t understand WHY Julianne Moore cheated and HOW Steve Carell
changed. The answer is that Steve Carell took his life for granted and
never developed his innate romantic skills. He had to discover his dark
side before finding out WHO he really is. He reveals this in his
climactic speech.<br /><br />While production values are top-notch, they are also suitably
forgettable. The important thing for me is I watched the closing
credits with a smile on my face, new found admiration for Emma Stone
and Marisa Tomei and discovered what a fine comedic actor Ryan Gosling
can be.
