What stands out in this movie (besides the look of some of the
mutants), is the clever way in which all the pieces fall into place as
a prequel which cements the backdrop and tone for the previous X-men
offers. This one however, stands above them though for the
consideration and tact that has gone into developing these
understandably complex characters. Resulting in a more complete movie
experience.<br /><br />The leading cast do a brilliant job in giving you a sense of their
conflict with ingredients such as prejudice, ignorance, a sense of
belonging and bitter revenge giving the film a more humane feel than a
lot of dramas allowing you to connect with the characters more easily.<br /><br />The special effects- lets not forget, are top notch as expected, but
surprisingly very in-keeping with the film and doesn&#x27;t take away from
the other elements of it. The violence is clean but present, pitched
right between a young and adult audience. There&#x27;s also a decent amount
of ironic humour thrown in, which, considering the party tricks on
offer (by that I mean the powers and peculiarities of the mutants),
just comes and goes naturally without feeling forced as like a lot of
comedy moments in films of late.<br /><br />Bottom-line, this is a well-constructed, well acted Marvel film. I
wasn&#x27;t totally convinced beforehand, casting James McAvoy as the young
Xavier, a full head of hair and northern accent doesn&#x27;t seem the best
fit after all. I can say that he fully realised that role and showed
his range in playing a more commanding lead. Michael Fassbender has
great screen presence and does a good shift as the Magneto to-be and Mr
Bacon adds another interesting element to the story. All the supporting
cast give a solid performance with everyone focused on the exciting job
at hand and no weak links.<br /><br />Easily worth the cinema admission and thank god they didn&#x27;t make it in
hit-and-miss 3d, there&#x27;s just no need! The best of the X-men franchise.
