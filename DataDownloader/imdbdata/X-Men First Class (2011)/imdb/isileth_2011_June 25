I&#x27;ve seen all the X-Men movies and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would have liked
this one, too. I didn&#x27;t like James McAvoy that much and I feared that
this movie could prove a letdown. I was wrong. The movie is great, well
directed, CGI good to watch without being more important than the movie
itself and - most of all - the acting was really good. McAvoy and
Fassbender were great in depicting Xavier and Erik. Their emotions look
real, not acted, their chemistry great. And the other characters work
well, too, villains and good guys. I liked also the Bondesque style of
the part during the 60s. Drama and humour are well mixed and they give
depth to a good action movie. Just a last line: Magneto is right in
distrusting humans.
