Two years have gone by since the release of the last X film; X-Men
Origins: Wolverine. This being the origin story of the franchise&#x27;s most
popular character, so naturally expectations were high. However, when
the film turned out to be nothing more than an action flick lacking
character development, story and general attention to detail many fans,
including myself, felt cheated. Rumors of other Origin projects, this
time focused on Magneto and Deadpool, took off and fizzled out as soon
as X-Men First Class was announced. This at first seemed like a wild
stab in the dark for the studio after Wolverine failed to deliver.
However, it eventually became clear that it would fill in the history
for several main characters at once; Professor X, Magneto, Mystique and
Beast, as well as introducing several new heroes and villains to the
screen. Sounds too good to be true right? Well fortunately, it isn&#x27;t!<br /><br />This film may well be the best X-Men movie to date, rivaling only with
X-Men 2. Finally there&#x27;s something in this film that&#x27;s been absent from
the franchise for far too long: the ability to make us care about the
characters. The majority of the film&#x27;s characters are relatable and
have their own personal conflicts such as insecurity, anger and
loyalty. These are especially noticeable with James McAvoy&#x27;s Professor
X and Michael Fassbender&#x27;s Magneto. Both actors have a brilliant fresh
take on the characters. Professor X is far less serious than his
previous portrayal. Yes he lectures students and advises the FBI, as
you&#x27;d expect, but he&#x27;s also out in the field fighting the bad guys with
the rest of the team and is out drinking in bars when he&#x27;s not on the
job. He&#x27;s young and it shows. Magneto here is vengeful, powerful but
clearly human. He&#x27;s been through some pretty dark stuff so has a right
to be angry and Professor X knows this. These two together have great
chemistry and their friendship feels real, even though we know that
ultimately their views will separate them. The rest of the X-Men do get
their time to shine, Mystique and Beast also deserve a mention for
character chemistry, but they&#x27;re all ultimately shadowed by Magneto and
Professor X who seem to steal the show slightly. Although not all of
First Class&#x27;s villains are convincing, Kevin Bacon&#x27;s Sebastian Shaw is
casually brutal which really works for a threatening bad guy, and the
bright red teleporting Azazel (yes, he is pretty much a red
Nightcrawler) is pure ninja in a fight.<br /><br />Moving on to the action, the fights between the X-Men and the Hellfire
Club are brilliant and even the training is great to watch. First Class
really does have some great jaw dropper moments. Sadly the film does
have a weakness, well, depending on how you look at it. First class
doesn&#x27;t quite seem to know where it stands with the other X-Men films
in terms of continuity. Hence the term coined at the start of this
review; pre-boot. I&#x27;m not going to list all the things that stop it
from linking up with Origins: Wolverine or X3, but you might just have
to pretend those films didn&#x27;t happen for it to all make sense. Some of
us already were anyway&#x85;
