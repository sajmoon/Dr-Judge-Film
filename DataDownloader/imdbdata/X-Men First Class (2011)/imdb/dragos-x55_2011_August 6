It&#x27;s a complete terrible tedious rubbish of a movie. All positive
reviews here are fake! The story was very boring. The SR-71 Blackbird
aircraft should only have one or, rarely, two seats, and it is not
hollow inside. The submarine had a way too large interior for its size,
not to mention its interior was completely unrealistic. The scene with
the missiles at the end was embarrassing to watch. I&#x27;m not sure why
there are so many positive reviews. One might begin to wonder whether
somebody is manipulating the system. And how could this movie possibly
have an 8.0 rating? I no longer trust IMDb and its ratings. IMDb has
become corrupt, unfortunately. I demand that IMDb does something to fix
this.
