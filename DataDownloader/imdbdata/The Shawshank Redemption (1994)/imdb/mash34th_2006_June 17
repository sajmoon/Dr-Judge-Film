As an omnivorous reader movies are always second to books to me. I
believe....movie can never defeat the book because while reading book
we use our own imagination....and movie narrows down the
imagination.....it only allows us to see how the director has imagined
the book.<br /><br />But Believe me...this is not the case of The Shawshank
Redemption...which I rate as the best movie I have ever seen.For the
first time in history the book(the Stephen King Novella) has been
defeated by its movie version.After watching the movie I was crazy
about reading the book....I thought wow!the movie is so good...how will
be the book!!To tell U frankly,the book is good, but the movie is
best.There are some unforgettable scenes in the movie which were not in
the book.Some examples are: The scene when Andy locks up the guard and
play the opera on the microphone.The narration goes on like..&quot;I didn&#39;t
understand a single word that Italian lady was singing...but I tell
U..for that single second every soul in the Shawshank prison felt
free...&quot;The scene just fill my heart with Andy&#39;s yearn for freedom...I
was kinda shocked when I didn&#39;t find it in the original book version.<br /><br />I can remember another scene.While Andy creates the prison library and
starts listing books sent to prison from charity organizations...a
fellow inmate tries to read a name on the book...Alexandre Dumas as
&quot;Dumb-Ass&quot;. Andy says....&quot;its not Dumb-ass...its Dumas..and U may like
the book..The Count of Monty Cristo...its about a jailbreak.And the
category it falls is Fiction&quot; Then Red says..&quot;Why don&#39;t we put it on
Educational category?&quot;(Right before Andy listed an engineering handbook
as &quot;Educational&quot; category).As Count of Monticristo is one of my
favorite books, I was hysteric watching this sophisticated joke.This
was also not in the book.<br /><br />This DVD is my favorite gift I give my friends. And after they watch
it....they always thank me . Like many other IMDb friends commenting on
this movie..I would also like to say..&quot;Shawshank Redemption is the best
movie I have ever seen in my life&quot;.Thanx to all.
