1999_February 6 

Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer
to it by title, but rather as &quot;The Movie&quot;.  When I say &quot;The Movie&quot;, my
friends know exactly what I'm talking about.  In fact the main reason that
me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so
great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in
vain!
I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption.  Some
friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those &quot;Budget Theaters&quot; over
the summer of 1995.  None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we
had heard that it was pretty good.  So, not having any real expectations, we
saw it.  When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the
theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor.
I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said &quot;That was the greatest movie
I have ever seen in my entire life!&quot;
There's really no other way I can put it in words.  Every moment of
this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing
in life...... &quot;HOPE&quot;.  This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold,
funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same
time.  I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the
greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie
history!  How it all just &quot;comes together&quot; is so incredible and uplifting.
I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well,
and the soundtrack is a &quot;must buy&quot; for any music fan.
The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will
never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see.  I've seen many
movies over the past few years, many excellent films.  However, every time I
walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it
with and I say, &quot;That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as
'you know what'!&quot;  There have been many movies over the past few years that
thought would really move me or that I might one day call my &quot;favorite of
all time&quot;, but they've all fallen far short of &quot;The Shawshank
Redemption&quot;.
So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store
immediately.  You're guaranteed to find it in the &quot;employee picks&quot; section.
And if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there
that there is something seriously wrong with them.  If you have seen this
movie, go see it again.  If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one.
In fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an
emergency. :o)
So, you want a 1-10 rating???  I give it a 13!!!!!!<br /><br />
