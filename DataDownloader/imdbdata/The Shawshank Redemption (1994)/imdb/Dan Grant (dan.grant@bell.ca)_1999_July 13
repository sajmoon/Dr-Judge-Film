Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now
you can add Shawshank to that list.<br /><br />This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the
first to say that and I certainly won&#39;t be the last. The standing on
the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I&#39;m sure
it could be number 1. So I&#39;ll just skip all the normal praise of the
film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that
what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote
it.<br /><br />King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the
Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his
best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was
brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned
Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes
onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to
understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. <br /><br />What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it
conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim
Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he
never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man
again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane,
but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a
different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and
I don&#39;t know if there will again.<br /><br />I&#39;m not going to say any more about this film, it has already been
said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best
picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or
Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will
be appreciated for years to come.
