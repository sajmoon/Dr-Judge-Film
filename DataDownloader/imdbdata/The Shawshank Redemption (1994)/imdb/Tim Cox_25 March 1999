One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story
about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a
movie. It tells a lesson about life.
Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's
also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, 
from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are
majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other.
Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first
moment they make contact with one another. There is also a
wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.<br /><br />He shines when it is his time to go back into the world,
only
to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got
a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the
screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion
that people &quot;will&quot; be talking about in 
50 or 100 years.
