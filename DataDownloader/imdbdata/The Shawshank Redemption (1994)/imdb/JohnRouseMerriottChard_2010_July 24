The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It
is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and
Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film
portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is
sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for
apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going
but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate, Ellis
&#x22;Red&#x22; Redding (Freeman) . While things start to pick up when the warden
finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker.
However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things
for all of them.<br /><br />There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film
back in 94, with a title that didn&#x27;t give much inkling to anyone about
what it was about-and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it,
Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come
Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although
it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home
entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film
finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost
mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that
has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors.
One thing is for sure, tho, is that which ever side of the Shawshank
fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will
never go away.<br /><br />It&#x27;s possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the
film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent
sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two
chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. But
when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it
strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that&#x27;s dealing in hope,
friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that
acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of
the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No
chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during
incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of
Robbins (never better) &#x26; Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it&#x27;s the
easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.<br /><br />Those in support aren&#x27;t faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled
spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great
as the &#x22;Birdman Of Shawshank,&#x22; Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist
Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood &#x26; Mark Rolston is
impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there&#x27;s Roger Deakins&#x27; lush
cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison
offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours).
The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie
too. Thomas Newman&#x27;s score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly
with Andy&#x27;s state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack
ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di
Figaro by Mozart.<br /><br />If you love Shawshank then it&#x27;s a love that lasts a lifetime. Every
viewing brings the same array of
emotions-anger-revilement-happiness-sadness-inspiration and a warmth
that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all
else, tho, Shawshank offers hope; not just for characters in a movie,
but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10
