One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story
about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with
everyone
giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie,
but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison
guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrail of an
elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at
least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very
surprising &quot;twist&quot; near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If
you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll
want to see this one more than once.
