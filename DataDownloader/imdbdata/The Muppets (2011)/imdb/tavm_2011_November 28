Just watched this movie with my movie theatre-working friend and,
having just also seen the first two Muppet movies again, I felt like
laughing and was feeling nostalgic throughout the whole experience to
the point I almost was in tears when moments like when Kermit was
singing about missing his old friends and then again when the whole
gang was once again on stage reprising &#x22;The Rainbow Connection&#x22; near
the end were happening. Kudos to Jason Segel in both co-writing and
starring in what I&#x27;m sure was a labor of love to him. And his leading
lady Amy Adams also was pretty charming enough. And then there&#x27;s
Walter, a new Muppet with voice by Peter Linz, that is partly the heart
of this movie. The other part is of course that of Kermit in once again
getting reacquainted with the likes of Fozzie, Gonzo, among others all
the way down to perhaps the most endearing charms of the one and only
Miss Piggy. There&#x27;s also a nice campy villainous turn by Chris Cooper
especially when he says &#x22;maniacal laugh&#x22; to his Muppet minions. There&#x27;s
also some entertaining original songs by Bret McKenzie and others that
should get one either humming or tapping their toes like the show
stopping &#x22;Life&#x27;s a Happy Song&#x22; that could possibly get another Oscar
nomination for a Muppet movie. The only songs I didn&#x27;t like, to tell
the truth, were the ones where Ms. Adams sings about being alone at a
diner or that rap by Cooper but they don&#x27;t ruin the film too much. In
summary, I found myself grinning from ear to ear during most of the
picture especially with all the usual, or unusual, celebrity cameos. So
on that note, The Muppets gets a high recommendation from me.
