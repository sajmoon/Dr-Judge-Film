2012_February 7 
I&#x27;m what you&#x27;d call a casual fan of the Muppet characters. Jim Henson&#x27;s
creations weren&#x27;t a huge part of my childhood, as I grew up when their
popularity started to wane in the 90&#x27;s. Although &#x22;Muppet Christmas
Carol&#x22; and &#x22;Muppet Treasure Island&#x22; were among my childhood favorites,
and I did watch repeats of the &#x22;Muppet Show&#x22; on trusty old cable. I
loved the characters, but wasn&#x27;t an enormous fan. However, over the
past few years, in my early 20&#x27;s, as I have started to explore
different films, I rediscovered their magic, and have become a bigger
and bigger fan, watching the show and the old films more and more. So I
was excited when this movie was announced not long after I became a fan
again, as it seemed to coincide with my re-discovery of the characters,
making it seem like perfect timing on my part.<br /><br />This is a marvelous film. Plain, simple, true. It has an appeal for
everyone, child or adult. It&#x27;s characters (human and muppet alike) are
all likable and fleshed out, the production is high quality, and it has
an enormous heart. This is one of the few films I&#x27;ve seen recently that
had the ability to put an enormous smile on my face, and keep me
grinning (and occasionally crying) throughout.<br /><br />This is also a return to form for the characters, who have fallen into
obscurity lately, and it treated them all with respect and care. This
is as good a tribute to Henson&#x27;s work as possible.<br /><br />The film was directed by James Bobin and written by Nicolas Stoller and
Muppet-fanatic Jason Segal, whom also co-stars. And you can tell it was
written by a Muppet fan in Segal. His love for the characters helps
this film soar above and beyond.<br /><br />We open with two brothers- Gary (Segal) and Walter. Gary is a human,
while Walter is, somehow, a Muppet. Both a very close with one another,
even though Walter sometimes feels down as a Muppet in a human family.
However, upon discovering &#x22;The Muppet Show&#x22; as a child and realizing he
is not alone, Walter feels better, and is now the world&#x27;s biggest
Muppet fan.<br /><br />When Gary plans on taking his girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams- what needs to
be said, she&#x27;s perfect) to Los Angelas to celebrate their tenth
anniversary as a couple, he decides to take Walter along, so he can go
on a tour of the Muppet studios.<br /><br />Walter is excited, but realizes that since falling into obscurity in
today&#x27;s world, the Muppets have broken up and spread over the world.
Walter also hears a devious scheme by oil-man Tex Richman (Chris Cooper
as a hilarious villain), whom plots on demolishing the Muppet studio to
drill for oil, and he sets out with Gary and Mary to bring the muppets
back together and save the studio the only way they know how- by having
a show!<br /><br />From there on, the movie turns into a hilarious and heartfelt road trip
picture, as we are re-joined by Kermit, Miss Piggy, Gonzo, Fozzie and
the others, as they come together once again!<br /><br />The film is exceptionally well made. Bobin&#x27;s direction is light and
kinetic. Some wonderful musical numbers by Brett MaKenzie are fun and
memorable (including this year&#x27;s Oscar nominated &#x22;Man or Muppet&#x22;), the
writing is top notch, and as I said, this film has something for
everyone, young or old, newcomer or Muppet Veteran. The acting is also
perfect (particularly from the Muppeteers including Steve Whitmore,
Eric Jacobson, Dave Goelz and Peter Linz as the new Mupper Walter),
finding the right balance between campy and at times satirical
performances, and seriousness. The whole movie walks a very
meta/satirical line, actually. (A lot of the movies did, but this one
moreso) And I will say, it skillfully and perfectly navigates this line
without going too far, as many films do.<br /><br />And as I said, this is also a very emotional film. Segal obviously
appreciates these characters, and delivers a story that will supply
plenty of tears. The Muppets are portrayed as real, honest-to-god
&#x22;people&#x22; with wants and needs, and their own emotional baggage from the
world. It does fall into a dangerous trap early on by being a bit too
serious, but as it continues and the light and fun are restored, it
gets better and better.<br /><br />I am truly and honestly touched by this film. It is one of the finest
films of 2011, and is my personal favorite. It&#x27;s also arguably the best
Muppet movie since the original, and will be remembered for years to
come as a modern classic and a phenomenal re-introduction to the
characters.<br /><br />&#x22;The Muppets&#x22; is a perfect 10!
