Growing up as a little kid in the late 70&#x27;s and early 80&#x27;s I fell in
love with &#x22;The Muppets&#x22; watching Kermit on TV and collecting his little
plush toys and friend action figures. As his little green face always
brought a smile as &#x22;The Muppets&#x22; were always fun loving and an escape
of joy and happiness for me always bringing about a bright rainbow! So
it was good to see after many years that a new big screen movie
adaptation has once again came to life.<br /><br />Starring Jason Segel(&#x22;How I Meet Your Mother&#x22;)as Gary a man who still
has a Muppet obsession even after all grown up and now ready to marry
his sweetheart Mary(the beautiful Amy Adams),despite this good news
Gary hears from his good Muppet friend Walter that an evil oil tycoon
Tex(Chris Cooper)is planning on destroying the old Muppet theater,
which by the way the Muppets and Kermit are planning on using for a
comeback musical show.<br /><br />Yet never fear with the help of Walter, Gary and Mary travel all the
way to Hollywood to join little green buddy Kermit and his pals to save
the day. Along the way you as a viewer feel happy, sad, and feel good
entertaining moments it brings back your childhood memories as a kid
when seeing Fozzie Bear, Animal, Gonzo, Rowlf, and outspoken Miss
Piggy! Also some eye catching guest appearances are found from Emily
Blunt and Alan Arkin. Overall fun feel good film that will bring back
and take you to your childhood memories see it if your a &#x22;Muppets&#x22; fan
it&#x27;s nice to see that cute happy little green friend Kermit again.
