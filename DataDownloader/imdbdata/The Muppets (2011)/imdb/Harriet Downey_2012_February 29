Satyrical genius. It introduces the new story very well by having a
puppet grow up with a human family and looking into the perfect world
of the Muppets, only to see it all collapse. So obviously, he needs to
save them in order to be part of their family... Obviously.<br /><br />The opening songs are insanely cheesy, but knowing Jason Segel&#x27;s back
catalogue of work, it makes it OK. You know he&#x27;s just taking the mick.
This along with the characters taking to the audience makes it the
perfect parody. There is some shameful self-promotion from Disney with
the likes of a Cars 2 poster in a couple of background shots, but thats
OK too (this time it&#x27;s just because I like Disney).<br /><br />It&#x27;s packed with 80s nostalgia, so many cameos (Dave Grohl and Mickey
Rooney included) and tonnes of laughs. Get on it, if only to have
Mahna-mahnam stuck in your head the rest of the day, maybe even week.
