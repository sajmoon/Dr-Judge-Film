It&#x27;s been years since the Muppets were on the air and its fuzzy stars
have gone their separate ways. But when an evil tycoon conspires to
tear down the dilapidated Muppet Theatre, the stars are reunited by
fanatical new Muppet Walter, who is visiting L.A. with his brother Gary
and Gary&#x27;s girlfriend, Mary, who only wants to spend her anniversary
with her boyfriend.<br /><br />This movie is the sort of thing that never happens. It&#x27;s clear that
living and working with the Muppets was a huge childhood fantasy of
star/co-writer Jason Segel, who struts through the film with a big,
stupid grin on his face. And he has reason to be grinning, he
accomplished something that nobody else has been able to do in 20
years: he brought the Muppets back into the public consciousness in a
big way whilst retaining all the hallmarks that made them a phenomenon
in the &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s. The film has gratuitous celebrity cameos, &#x27;80s
references, self-references, inside jokes and general absurdity galore,
moments that tug at your heartstrings, two levels of humor (for adults
and kids), and a ton of catchy (and vastly diverse) songs.<br /><br />That&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s a perfect movie (and realistically a few Muppet
films come close but not a single one is a masterpiece). This film&#x27;s
greatest asset is simultaneously its greatest flaw: Segel, whom
admittedly gives a pitch-perfect performance as the happy-go-lucky
idiot who realizes it&#x27;s time to grow up. The problem is this story is a
little too big and takes time away from the Muppets themselves, though
Segel mostly takes a backseat (literally) to his fuzzy costars about 20
minutes in. Knowing how big of a fan he is -- it was Segel who
conceived the movie and pushed to get it made -- it makes this flaw not
only forgivable but downright endearing. He&#x27;s a 30-something kid
playing with all of his childhood TV friends.<br /><br />As promotion, the Muppets invaded the small-screen, appearing on
&#x22;Dancing with the Stars,&#x22; &#x22;WWE,&#x22; &#x22;Good Morning America,&#x22; the CMA
Awards, &#x22;The X Factor,&#x22; Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Jay Leno, Regis and
Kelly, and even &#x22;Saturday Night Live,&#x22; on which they were featured
during the first season (they left SNL for their own variety show).
It&#x27;s been decades since the Muppets have had that sort of exposure and,
while it remains to be seen if it will endure, it&#x27;s incredible that
this massive-scale revival only happened because one little boy loved
the Muppets.<br /><br />The message of both this and the original film is that dreams can come
true, and Jason Segel proved it can happen. Pretty inspiring and for
that reason alone there&#x27;s no question that Jim Henson would be proud.
