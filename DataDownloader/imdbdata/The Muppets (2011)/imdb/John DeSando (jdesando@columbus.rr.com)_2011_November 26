Waldorf: &#x22;Nope! The Muppets are as one-dimensional as they&#x27;ve always
been!&#x22;<br /><br />You can go home again, at least if you&#x27;re the Muppets, those genius Jim
Henson creations that for over 40 years have inspired Sesame Street and
Muppet movie mania not in 3-D. The most recent of the canon, The
Muppets, chronicles the gang getting together to help save the old
studio from a mean old oilman. They must do a telethon to raise the $10
million to save the place or it goes to Tex Richman (Chris Cooper). <br /><br />Writer/actor Jason Segel as Gary and wholesome Amy Adams as Mary are
the adult real people who help the Muppets put together the fund
raiser, with the cameo help of several stars including the indomitable
Mickey Rooney, who did a fund raising show or two in his cinematic
prime. The film shares Rooney&#x27;s love of performance as if their lives
depended on it, and their survival does. But nothing to fear, for they
are as melodic and eccentric as ever. <br /><br />Spirits are high as Miss Piggy and Kermit try to overcome their
tempestuous tendencies for the good of the group. Newcomer Muppet
Walter may not be as talented as the famous puppets, but his character
allows us to be awed with him by the star power of the original cast,
showing us all how we can become a part of the family with a little
imagination. <br /><br />Although I love words, I would have liked fewer of those and more
songs, which have been Muppet strength since the beginning. Songwriter
Bret McKenzie&#x27;s Life&#x27;s a Happy Song and Man or Muppet are toe-tapping
memorable and worthy to stand beside the chestnut of them all, Rainbow
Connection, which features Miss Piggy and Kermit and the crew at their
most romantic and familial. <br /><br />Yes, family is the real connection in this and all Muppet productions.
But that they are puppets not computer images beats even Pixar to the
tears. <br /><br />Fozzie Bear: &#x22;Wow, that was such an expensive looking explosion! I
can&#x27;t believe we had that in the budget.&#x22;
