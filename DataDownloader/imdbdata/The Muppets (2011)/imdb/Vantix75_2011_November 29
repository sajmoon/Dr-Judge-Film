The Muppet&#x27;s just aren&#x27;t the same under Disney ownership. There&#x27;s so
much Disney product &#x26; cast placement in this movie to make you sick,
and the Muppet&#x27;s are now a side act to a live-action story.<br /><br />On a good note; the film inspired me to purchase the original 3 movies
as well as the old Muppet shows on DVD.<br /><br />Old fans will feel some nostalgia with the new movie, but you&#x27;ll get a
MUCH better experience going back to the roots of it all.<br /><br />Summary: A few laughs, but the acting is very dry. The music just
doesn&#x27;t seem to fit in most places and is sometimes cringe-worthy.
Possibly a good experience for newcomers and young-uns, but it wasn&#x27;t
my cup of tea.
