Imagine a bunch of 40 somethings that had never moved out of their
mothers&#x27; basements and existed on nothing but Muppet TV and movie
reruns, and then were given the chance to create a movie. However, they
couldn&#x27;t use any music from the series or the movies, they couldn&#x27;t use
the original voices, and they had to guarantee that every moment would
be predictable, boring and horribly unfunny. The result would be The
New Muppet Movie. I loved the original series, I really liked the first
and third Muppet&#x27;s movies - and tolerated the 2nd, but this movie is
simply terrible. It uses continuing references to the 30 year old
Muppet series, apparently assuming today&#x27;s children have been
reincarnated from the disco era. Even the brothers sequences seems
terribly contrived and unworkable. I feel very sorry for Amy Adams
because she will be apologizing for being in this movie until 2050. Do
yourself a favor. Buy the original Muppet movie or Muppets Take
Manhattan and save your eyes from this horror.
