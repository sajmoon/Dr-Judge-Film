2011_December 13 
As any film critic and movie-goer will tell you, 2011 is the Year of
Nostalgia. It&#x27;s impossible to explain this phenomenon &#x96; maybe it&#x27;s the
result of the public&#x27;s collective need to escape from the grimness of
reality or maybe it&#x27;s the upshot of aging film-makers struck by the
urge to reflect upon their lives and careers or maybe it&#x27;s simply a
coincidence &#x96; yet in the end, it hardly matters. The fact is, several
movies this year express a yearning for the past, either directly
(Super 8, Hugo, The Artist) or obliquely (Crazy, Stupid, Love,
Moneyball, We Bought a Zoo). Of those in the latter category, The
Muppets is most successful at transporting viewers to a bygone era, a
supposedly happier time, more rational in which dreams came true if you
believed in yourself, and good inevitably triumphed over evil. It&#x27;s
Singin&#x27; in the Rain meets Toy Story 3: a delightful ode to the power of
friendship, the strength of the human spirit and the joy of childhood
that&#x27;s bound to charm the most steadfast cynic.<br /><br />The movie opens with a montage showing the two main characters, Gerry
and his brother Walter, growing up, a five-minute scene that sets the
tone for the rest of the movie. Like Toy Story 3, which featured a
similar sequence during its opening credits, The Muppets is a &#x22;kids&#x27;&#x22;
movie that appeals just as much, if not more, to adults and, despite
being an ostensible comedy, aims more for the heart than the funny
bone. It has its share of gags and jokes, yet what ultimately makes the
film special is its ability to blend off-the-walls elation with wistful
melancholy, to advocate traditional values in a fresh, inspired way and
to evoke memories of the past without coming off as resentful or
condescending. Although each scene bursts with manic energy, beneath
all that can-do spirit and gleeful fluff, the movie is bittersweet;
it&#x27;s not simply an attempt to introduce a beloved host of characters to
a media-savvy generation but a tender elegy to the lost innocence of
youth. In its own uplifting way, The Muppets insists that the past is
still relevant and always will be, no matter how far away it seems.<br /><br />Of course, The Muppets also works as pure spectacle. The cast is huge,
thanks to numerous cameos, including Neil Patrick Harris and Emily
Blunt (in a clever wink at her work in 2005&#x27;s The Devil Wears Prada).
It is a credit to the tact of the film-makers that none of the cameos
distracts from the storyline or the central actors, who fulfill their
parts with aplomb. As the lead, Jason Segel radiates verve and
sincerity, his well-documented fondness for Jim Henson&#x27;s felt creations
palpable. He makes an endearing couple with Amy Adams, who, after The
Fighter, returns to the cheery persona that made her famous, though
here, it&#x27;s more effective than in movies like Doubt and Enchanted. Also
impressive is Chris Cooper, who makes the villainous Tex Richman both
legitimately menacing and appropriately cartoonish. However, the real
stars are the Muppets themselves. The whole gang is back, engaging in
their usual lovable antics, and there is something heartwarming about
the sight of old-fashioned, tangible puppets in an era of digital
animation. At the forefront is Kermit the Frog, as earnest as ever, and
feminist diva Miss Piggy, and their romance is so surprisingly
heartfelt that it&#x27;s easy to forget that they&#x27;re not human. The whole
thing brims with infectious energy, complete with musical numbers that
represent some of the catchiest tunes since Disney&#x27;s 1990s heyday
(standouts include the joyous &#x22;Life&#x27;s a Happy Song&#x22; and a triumphant
rendition of the classic &#x22;The Rainbow Connection&#x22;). It hardly matters
that the plot itself is as frothy and predictable as that of a
traditional TV sitcom.<br /><br />The day after seeing The Muppets, I came across an article on The A.V.
Club that I found uncannily resonant, even though it was actually a
review of the latest episode of NBC&#x27;s wry, pop culture-obsessed show
Community. In it, author Todd VanDerWerff asserted that the episode, a
Christmas special that parodied Fox&#x27;s hot-button musical-comedy Glee,
reminded him of one thing: that, to quote directly, &#x22;liking things is
vital&#x22;. In a way, that could be the message of this film year. As
reflected in the Best Picture wins of such films as No Country for Old
Men and The Hurt Locker, recent cinema is dominated by cynicism, a
sense that the best movies are ones that reveal some fundamental truth
behind the chaos of reality. In contrast, this year&#x27;s most popular
movies and prime Oscar contenders, including silent-film homage The
Artist and Steven Spielberg&#x27;s weepie War Horse, are saturated with
optimism. Predictably, this trend has drawn complaints from critics who
bemoan the attention given to the aforementioned films instead of
darker offerings like Martha Marcy May Marlene and Melancholia,
essentially equating lighthearted romanticism with escapist fluff. This
is where I finally arrive at my point: while I understand the need for
grittier, more somber fare, it&#x27;s a mistake to assume that pessimism is
the same as seriousness or that optimism is the same as naivet&#xE9;. Maybe
I&#x27;m just a sentimental person, but to me, this shift in attitude is a
breath of fresh air. This year has given me some of the most
eye-opening and downright magical film experiences I&#x27;ve had in a while
in Super 8, Moneyball and Hugo, all of which favor emotional catharsis
over &#x22;realism&#x22;. The Muppets may not be on the same level as those, but
it exemplifies an idea extremely relevant to our perpetually ironic,
postmodern climate: it is okay to feel good. It is okay to indulge in
nostalgia or yield to emotion. Sometimes, you have to stop analyzing
everything and learn to let go. Cynics had their turn, and chances are,
this is nothing more than a fleeting anomaly. For now, though, let us
dreamers have our moment in the sun, just for one year.
