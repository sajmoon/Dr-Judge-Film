For most people, they know who the Muppets are. Ever since the mid
50&#x27;s, the late-Jim Henson has made the Muppets become such iconic
figures. Kermit, Fozzie, Gonzo, Miss Piggy, Rowlf, Sam the Eagle,
Swedish Chef, and many others. They&#x27;ve had an ongoing history and ever
since, have gotten much from Jim Henson and Frank Oz, even getting
their own show and a few movies to it as well.<br /><br />The first film, &#x22;The Muppet Movie&#x22;, showed the origins of the Muppets
and how they met up. It had the great feel of a road trip movie, as
well as spawning many cameos from famous actors at the time of the
late-70s, like Mel Brooks, Dom Deluise, Steve Martin, Bob Hope, Carol
Kane, Richard Pryer, even Orson Welles. It was a great start, for a
great gang of characters we all have now come to love, which is why it
was the film that most people remembered. As for &#x22;The Great Muppet
Caper&#x22; and &#x22;Muppets Take Manhattan,&#x22; I don&#x27;t remember much of it, but
everyone has said that they were pretty good for what they&#x27;re worth, so
I&#x27;ll take their word for it. As for &#x22;Muppet Christmas Carol,&#x22; it was
something that really had much passion to it, with keeping true to the
Charles Dickens classic. With it being the first film the Muppets did
without Jim Henson, after his tragic death in 1990, &#x22;Muppet Christmas
Carol&#x22; showed us that no matter what, the legacy would never die out.
Now for &#x22;Muppet Treasure Island,&#x22; I do remember some things from it,
like the opening number being such an enjoyable way to start a movie,
and Tim Curry giving one heck of a great performance. But aside from
that, not much else can be said about it. With their last theatrical
film, &#x22;Muppets from Space,&#x22; I haven&#x27;t seen. Many people have stated
that it wasn&#x27;t really good or that it was alright for what it was. If
that&#x27;s what people think, then more power to them, since I cannot
compare my opinion with them.<br /><br />Now let&#x27;s get down to the newest movie. How does it hold up? Well, I
have to be honest, it&#x27;s pretty good. It&#x27;s a fun, entertaining,
enjoyable, family movie. It&#x27;s got just about everything you&#x27;d expect in
a Muppet movie. Singing, dancing, cameos, an interesting story, 4th
wall jokes, and obviously, the Muppets. With what this new film has
given, it works and is appropriate to show kids of this generation who
they are, as well as give off a great deal of nostalgia to those who&#x27;ve
grown up with them. Even though, Frank Oz and other Muppet veterans
have disregarded it, as a mockery, just to cash in on the &#x27;Judd Apatow
style of gross-out humor&#x27;, like with the fart shoes you see Fozzie wear
in the trailer. It didn&#x27;t bother me much, despite the fact that I&#x27;m not
a fan of Judd Apatow to begin with. Even Kermit can agree that it&#x27;s
just a cheap joke, and it&#x27;s hilarious to know that an iconic character
knows that films that follow that similar format that think they&#x27;re
funny, by using the &#x27;f&#x27; word constantly, or just making dumb gross
jokes; that type of humor does work sometimes, if it isn&#x27;t overused,
but when it&#x27;s used throughout the majority of one film, then it gets
old really fast. Going back to the new Muppet film, it really does its
best to try and be something new, instead of just a mindless remake
like most movie studios have been doing since the late nineties.
Surprisingly to most, this movie is actually a continuation of the
Muppets, instead of rehashing the whole thing from scratch. It shows
where Kermit and friends have been, what happened, and how they get
back together again.<br /><br />Jason Segel did an excellent job co-writing the script, and giving off
one of the best performances of his career in a movie. I could tell
with the look in his eyes that he was a big Muppets fan, and wanted to
give them the film they deserved after such a long time. Not only that,
but with him being a Broadway kind of guy, he really has an amazing
singing voice, from the opening song that he does, that&#x27;s really
catchy. I also enjoyed the chemistry between him and his adoptive
Muppet brother, to where you could feel a bit teary eyed at the sad
scenes with them. Amy Adams did a great job with this too, and was
pretty enjoyable as the lead actress. She was funny, she was charming,
and knew how to give such a great performance. Plus, I gotta give props
to Chris Cooper, for almost every scene he was in making me laugh. The
cameos they had in this film made me pleased, counting out most of
them, and for how they made they&#x27;re screen time so great in such a
small amount of time.<br /><br />Now even with how good this was, the only complaint I had with the
movie was the ending. Not that it was bad or anything, but it built up
to a point where you feel it taking another direction you never thought
they&#x27;d go, like a very adult and mature ending. I felt that with all
that build up, you think that they&#x27;d actually had the guts to go there.
But despite that, I found it to be one of those perfect movies.<br /><br />Overall, The Muppets is a film that has a lot of passion and shows
great respect to the franchise. I highly recommend it for anyone who
wants that feel of nostalgia, or someone who&#x27;s just looking for a good
film to go to. It surely won&#x27;t disappoint.
