In one weak moment, I decided to watch The Muppets. Yes, I did. Purely
on peer pressure despite not being a fan of The Muppet Show and not
having watched Muppet Cavalclade or Muppets Jack Sparrow. I&#x27;m glad I
watched these Muppets though for it has taught me a few of life&#x27;s most
unforgettable lessons. Here is a list of things I learned from The
Muppets (in order of appearance).<br /><br />PS: May contain spoilers.<br /><br />The plot basis. The Muppets established a long time ago that the
theater belonged to J.P. Grosse (Scooter&#x27;s uncle); how could Kermit
just kind of sign it over to Chris Cooper? OK, that&#x27;s a nerd point -
but it still stands.<br /><br />Miss Piggy is nowhere near as funny without Frank Oz. Jacobsen just
isn&#x27;t getting it done; she doesn&#x27;t have the same camera presence, the
slow pauses and turns towards the camera, etc. The voice is...close
enough, I guess, but the puppeteering just lacks.<br /><br />Miss Piggy&#x27;s violence was always directed in large part towards Kermit,
and towards others only secondarily; that&#x27;s what made it funny. She
lashed out when she couldn&#x27;t have what she wanted more than anything.
Now Kermit wants Piggy? Ruins the whole dynamic. Not funny, not
interesting.<br /><br />Amy Adams just isn&#x27;t a very good actress. There, I said it. .<br /><br />The endless Disney/ABC cameo system. Arrrgh! Putting Cars 2 billboards
all over the movie? Having Whoopi Goldberg, Rico Rodriguez et al appear
in the movie just for some publicity was just too much. What the
audience cares - or should care about - is the Muppets, especially the
classic characters. You had major characters barely have any role at
all. We only caught a fleeting glimpse of Rizzo and Bunsen Honeydew,
yet we have to endure an onslaught of celeb cameos which furthered the
plot by precisely zero? You can chase your enemies in a BMW coupe which
hits other cars at high speed without getting a scratch on it until
crashing at a bridge. You can still lose your enemy though, who escapes
in an Isuzu pickup truck.<br /><br />No matter how yummy Nachos and Salsa sauce are, if the movie is crap,
you should get a refund.
