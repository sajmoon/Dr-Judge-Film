I really, really, really wanted to like this movie. I love the Muppets,
and Jason Segal is a talented guy who also really loves the Muppets.
They had everything there for a great film, and somehow it just fell
apart. The start was cute, the middle was numbing, and the end was not
great. It dragged. In some places it really dragged. And the end was
anti-climactic.<br /><br />I have to place this firmly at the feet of the director and the
producers. This is the directors first feature length film. Up to this
point he has been directing episodic cable television programs (The
Conchords and Da Ali G Show). It&#x27;s hard to move between the mediums of
TV and film, as well as between the genres of semi-adult TV comedy and
family movie. I have to say I more blame the producers (and Disney) for
letting this director cut his feature length teeth on something as big
as the Muppets on his first try.<br /><br />I recommend waiting for it to hit cable.
