All right, I loved it in this movie when the Muppets did a great
rendition of their trademark song &#x22;The Rainbow Connection&#x22;, I always
enjoy watching Jack Black and he has a wonderfully funny cameo as the
celebrity host and I thought that Fozzie&#x27;s fart shoes were cool.
However, there was little to nothing else I liked in this yawner of a
film. I write this negative review with a heavy heart because I grew up
loving Sesame Street and The Muppet Show and the 1979 Muppet Movie. I
was hoping to feel a rush of joy and nostalgia when the movie started
however I was just mostly bored to tears, maybe I&#x27;m just getting old
and grumpy. The magic just isn&#x27;t there anymore. There were several
songs in this film and all of them just fell flat as a pancake. There
was one song called Are You A Man Or A Muppet that just about sent me
screaming out of the cinema!
