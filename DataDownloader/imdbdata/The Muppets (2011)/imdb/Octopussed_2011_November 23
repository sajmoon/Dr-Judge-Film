&#x22;The Muppets&#x22; movie has made me finally except the fact that the
Muppets died with Jim Henson 20 years ago. I have been preparing myself
for this film for quit some time. I held back any hope so I would would
not disappoint myself, but even doing that didn&#x27;t stop me from being
completely deflated after seeing this film. What really sucks about it
is that people think this actually good. This isn&#x27;t a Muppet movie,
this is a crappy film with some familiar looking puppets and few
mediocre songs.<br /><br />The story is based off of some ironically generic plot that really is
more dull then smart. Kermit was a shadow of himself, he was just
another puppet pushing the one dimensional storyline. There were no
sincere relationships in any two seconds of this film except for the
new Muppet Walter and his human brother. Where was the funny banter
between Miss Piggy and Kermit, their relationship in this film was so
trite and uninteresting. Hardly any of the characters had time to
shine. The cameos were sad and forced, mere plugs for Disney&#x27;s other
shows on ABC and Disney channel.<br /><br />Grant it this is suppose to feed off of The Muppet Show so the Muppets
in the film are already claimed celebrities but part of the situational
humor in their films is that &#x27;real people&#x27; characters are usually
surprised by the Muppets as being curious talking animals but never
quite believe it to be impossible.<br /><br />The songs were whatever, not bad not great, but what I love is when
they actually get around to singing Rainbow Connection they take you
right out of it. This film is banking on your nostalgia they barely
give you a moment to feel it. But they do want to make sure they quench
your thirst for crappy 80s songs that are incessantly plugged every 15
minutes in the movie, probably to solidify what ever continuity they
think this one note story has.<br /><br />Now for nit picking, the Muppets themselves were poorly created
puppets. Miss Piggy does have phases of quality throughout her career
but this is the poorest of them all. They also made sure you saw this
film as they are, puppets. Every shot in the film was framed the same,
waist up. Yes I know they are puppets but usually film gives allowances
to be creative and give opportunities for fun life like illusions. You
can count on one hand the shots where you saw a Muppet standing. This
film highlights minimal imagination and franchise dependency.<br /><br />I am not accustom to bashing anything, but this is a heartbreakingly
bad movie. And not even as a Muppet movie but as a movie in general. If
you don&#x27;t believe me watch The Great Muppet Capper. Sorry Jason Segel.
