The plot: A puppet named Walter lives with his brother Gary (Jason
Segel) in a place called Smalltown. They have both been fans of the
Muppets since they were young and when Gary and his girlfriend Mary
(Amy Adams) plan to go to Los Angeles for their anniversary, they
realize it is a great time to go see Muppet Theater. Once they get
there though, things aren&#x27;t looking too good as they realize that the
only way the Muppets can get Muppet Theater back is if they all put on
a big show to raise $10 million before Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) can
destroy the theater for good.<br /><br />The good: There&#x27;s so many good things about The Muppets. One of the
first I will mention is the music. I think it&#x27;s safe to say you will
easily leave this movie with at least one song stuck in your head until
death. My personal favorites were &#x22;Life&#x27;s a happy song&#x22;, &#x22;Party of
one&#x22;, and a grand finale song of &#x22;Mahna Mahna&#x22; performed by the entire
cast. The music is so catchy and fun, even the biggest anti-Muppet
moviegoer will find it hard to resist the charm of the score.<br /><br />Another surprising thing about The Muppets is the amount of wit and
humor throughout, The Muppets is actually quite hilarious. There&#x27;s a
lot of sight gags with the Muppets that will keep the kids (and even
adults) entertained but there&#x27;s a lot of tongue in cheek humor that is
quite refreshing to see in a children&#x27;s movie. Characters will mention
songs right after they&#x27;re done singing them, they will cue for a
&#x22;manical laughter&#x22;, stop their conversations to let the audience know
that was an important plot point and even mention the budget of the
movie. There&#x27;s a particularly humorous scene when Kermit is mentioning
how he doesn&#x27;t think the Muppets will get back together, leading one
character to exclaim, &#x22;Well I guess this is gonna be a short movie&#x22;.
Witty stuff.<br /><br />Jason Segel and Amy Adams were the perfect choices for the leads as
well, I couldn&#x27;t picture anyone else replacing either of them. What,
with Jason Segel&#x27;s love of singing and very adolescent-like nature and
Amy Adams&#x27; ability to play the happiest mofo you will ever meet (see
Enchanted for further proof if you don&#x27;t believe me...this chick is
happy). A lot of celebrities make cameos at the end which is pretty
stellar to see as well. They actually put Jack Black in a role that I
liked him in.....color me shocked. :O &#xFEFF;The bad: As much as I love being
a Debbie Downer...I actually can&#x27;t think of a noticeable negative to
say about this movie. Wow.<br /><br />The gist: The Muppets is a delightful, irresistible, adorable movie for
moviegoers of all ages. The music is catchy, the performances are
wonderful, it does a classic group proud and will easily be welcomed
back by any fan of The Muppets. It&#x27;s just an awesome movie for the
whole family to watch, and how many movies these days can say that? Not
many. There&#x27;s your answer. Done.<br /><br />Grade: A<br /><br />Check out the rest of my reviews and lists here :)
