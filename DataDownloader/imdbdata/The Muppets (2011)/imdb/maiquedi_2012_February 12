The muppet&#x27;s charming looks (even with their legs extremely visible)
and a few trademark acts make up for a regrettable and senseless plot
and awkward human characters whose acting seems inappropriate for the
movie itself: other than the ridiculously funny cameo of Jack Black,
all the other celebrities seem out of place (Jason Segal) or wasted
oportunities (like Selena Gomez or Neil-Patrick Harris). The movie&#x27;s
main character isn&#x27;t all that bad, but kind of a clich&#xE9; underdog who&#x27;s
a fan of a dying trend, the crisis involving the muppets and human
characters are solved in ridiculous or senseless ways and some of the
characters are even forgotten along the way. Music acts are necessary,
but many of them, mostly the ones not involving the muppets themselves,
are quite poor. Also, I can&#x27;t really sympathize with the muppets when
they simply reject a member of the group to begin with, either. The
ending (but fortunately not the credits sequence) is quite
disappointing, to.<br /><br />On the other hand, however, Kermit is a well-done character and the
movie DOES have some funny and heartbreaking moments, mostly during the
second part of the movie, but I wish they&#x27;d focused more on the small
acts that made The Muppets so special to begin with...
