Before this starts I want to formally applaud and thank Jason Segel for
breathing new life back into the one of the most beloved group of
characters in media history, The Muppets! Most people know Jason Segel
for his work on the television show how &#x22;I Met Your Mother&#x22;, or his
comedic films like &#x22;I Love You Man&#x22;, &#x22;Forgetting Sarah Marshal&#x22;, or
&#x22;Knocked Up&#x22;. For the past four years Segel has been working on a new
Muppet movie (He wrote!) for a whole generation of tikes who went a
whole decade without them! <br /><br />The story is about Gary, (Jason Segel) his muppet brother Walter, and
Gary&#x27;s long-time girlfriend Mary (The incredible Amy Adams) who take a
trip to L.A to see The Muppet Studios. But arrive when a greedy oil
tycoon (Chris Cooper) want to take it down. The trio find Kermit the
Frog, and gather all the Muppets back together for one last show to
raise the money to keep the Muppets name alive. <br /><br />Think of this as some kind of re-introduction of the characters for
those who haven&#x27;t grown up with the them. Walter being a new Muppet
really fits in with the group in more ways than just being, well, a
muppet. All the characters are packed in with their iconic comedic
routes and characteristics so don&#x27;t think that you will miss any
Un&#x22;Bear&#x22;able jokes by Fozzy, or some drumming action by Animal! Miss
Piggy and her elaborate behavior, or Gonzo&#x27;s weirdness. This is a
Muppet movie so prepare for a show; Music, Dancing, laughs, etc. <br /><br />Every note the film tried to aim is hit with entertainment perfection.
The songs were catchy and at most times a little moving. The center
story is almost a love letter to The Muppets for being out of focus for
so many years. The main character Gary (Jason Segel) and Walter grow up
with the Muppets in being their biggest fans. If anyone is familiar
with The Muppet Show back from the 80&#x27;s than your really in for a show.
This film is so packed with celebrities that some were taken out for
the DVD/Blu Ray release! Celebrities like Neil Patrick Harris, Jack
Black, Zach Galifianakis, Emily Blunt, Alan Arkin, Jim Parsons, Sarah
Silverman. Pink, and even more. <br /><br />This movie was made from true Muppet lovers whom really took them to
the next level in their future history with us, the fans. The final
consensus is that if someone wagered that they could watch this movie
without smiling, they would lose. Even if they have to wait for the one
of most joyful endings in quite some time. It&#x27;s time to play the
music... it&#x27;s time to light the lights... It&#x27;s time to meet The
Muppets!
