I have previously written about the Muppet &#x27;franchise&#x27; when discussing
the last great Muppet movie (The Great Muppet Caper (1981)). I had
stated the brilliance of the late Jim Henson who began this visual
plethora of beautiful characters. At a later stage I will be writing
something more personal and fundamentally reflexive of his career, but
at this point I will simply comment on this particular film that
attempts to combine the love of a new audience with the more ferrel
likes of it&#x27;s original fans.<br /><br />Since 1984&#x27;s The Muppets Take Manhattan, the film career of the
Muppet&#x27;s has taken a very slow decline. OK, so the Christmas Carol
adaptation was genuinely brilliant (adequately emphasised by repeat
Christmas broadcasting), but subsequent films have been incredibly
questionable. So after about 12 years in obscurity, the Muppets seem to
make a comeback? Well, possibly. It was an absolute joy when I
discovered that Nicholas Stoller and Bret McKenzie (of Flight of the
Conchords fame) were advertised as being involved. This film, it would
seem, would be a film fundamentally aimed at the people that were
originally influenced by the band of felt characters.<br /><br />The story of an oil tycoon, Tex Richman (Chris Cooper), who wants to
overtake the Muppet studios, due to an apparent oil flow under said
ground, is a very obvious choice of story arc in the cannon of Muppet
movies. This was unfortunately an apparently contentious issue with the
always level-headed Fox News (sic). (As a side-line they stated that
this film was communist in it&#x27;s ideological stance - cause it didn&#x27;t
show an evil Obama administration - check the webosphere if you think
I&#x27;m making this s**t up!)<br /><br />The story of the rebranding of the Muppets is fundamental to the full
concept of this film. We see motifs taken from the more interesting
films of the cannon. Muppet movies are always self-reflexive, and
almost always comment on the fact that what is happening is in fact
film making! The crux of this particular film hinges on Walter. He is
essentially a Muppet, but has been brought up as the brother of Jason
Segal&#x27;s Gary. Walter, essentially represents the generation that this
film represents. What the Muppet franchise holds, is something that was
not represented through the 1990&#x27;s (certainly after the death of Jim
Henson).<br /><br />Every element of this film is entirely made for the audience that
firstly succumbed to the wonder back in 1976 (as well as previously
through Sesame Street). All good Muppet movies are self-reflexive. They
are able to transport the viewer to place that transcends their adult
life, bringing them back to a place of absolute comfort. Not only does
the presence of a character like Animal bring you back to a child-like
state, but it also rekindles your concept of values.<br /><br />With all The Muppets propensity to good, the fact that the film seems
to have a cross-over of independent and mainstream ideas makes the film
far more interesting than the usual &#x22;kiddie&#x22; fodder. I&#x27;m guessing that
only time will tell if the non-computerised Muppets will endure any
further beyond their felt restrictions. For my money, I would rather
watch 460 minutes of Kermit, rather than 230 minutes of some computer
generated frog-monster!<br /><br />www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com
