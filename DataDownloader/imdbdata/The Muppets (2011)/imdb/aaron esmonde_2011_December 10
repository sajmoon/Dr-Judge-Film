The Muppets re-team to save their old studio from a greedy oil
tycoon...<br /><br />After a series of made for TV outings The Muppets are given the care
and attention they deserve courtesy of director&#xA0;James Bobin and
writers&#xA0;Jason Segel &#x26;&#xA0;Nicholas Stoller.<br /><br />What&#x27;s noticeable are the Muppet&#x27;s themselves look like their-selves
while not the original TV season 1 versions they are the lovable and
popular versions in the earlier films and later TV seasons as appose to
the sterile odd looking models. Fozzy Bear looks like- Fozzy Bear.&#xA0;As a
bonus the voices are on the mark. <br /><br />The &#x27;original&#x27; contemporary setting is welcomed rather than a reworked
classic backdrop. Leads Segel and&#xA0;Amy Adams as&#xA0;Mary are well cast. The
Muppets is packed with cameos, the spirit, songs, gags and the humour
are all spot on. All the gang&#x27;s there -from Sam Eagle to Miss Piggy,
newer and lovable characters appear including&#xA0;Pepe the King Prawn and
even some new faces.&#xA0;<br /><br />If your an old fan it&#x27;s simply a perfect fantastic joy and it is also
fun introduction for a new generation.
