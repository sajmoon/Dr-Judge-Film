It&#x27;s disheartening to read poor reviews of this film. I went to see it
last night with my family, and we all loved it. Everyone else I&#x27;ve
spoken to has loved it as well, regardless of their previous exposure
to the Muppets.<br /><br />From the start, they do away with the 4th wall, invoke celebrity
cameos, poke fun at Hollywood plot impossibilities, drop
tongue-in-cheek references to days of Muppet yore, and acknowledge that
media aimed at children has lost its &#x22;goodie goodie&#x22; nature. I agree
with them-- after spending 10 years trying to keep my child away from
garbage TV, it&#x27;s wonderful and refreshing to see humor done with class
again. I sincerely hope that this acts as a launching pad for Muppet
Studios to begin producing regular media for our kids.<br /><br />Bravo, Muppets. Keep it up.
