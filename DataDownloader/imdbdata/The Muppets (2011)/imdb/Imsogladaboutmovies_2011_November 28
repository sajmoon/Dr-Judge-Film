Instead of this being a Muppet movie with Jason Segel, this was a Jason
Segel movie with the Muppets in a supporting role.<br /><br />Very little original content including the Muppets; it continually
referenced the classic The Muppet Movie in most of the scenes where
Jason Segel wasn&#x27;t the focus, which were few. A good portion of the
film was centered on a Muppet Telethon with a bunch of very short guest
cameos (mostly Disney franchise stars) and rehashing of old bits from
the original TV show.<br /><br />It&#x27;s very telling that Frank Oz disliked the script Jason Segel wrote
and refused to take part in production. I would love to read the Frank
Oz script. I bet Disney rejected it because it would&#x27;ve cost more to
produce.
