Off television for 30 years and off the big screen for 12, The Muppets
are finally back in a whole new adventure to dispense the third best
gift in the world: laughter. This time, instead of the late Jim Henson
at the helm, Jason Segel, James Bobin and others succeed in filling
some big shoes thanks in large part to their nostalgia for the
characters.<br /><br />The plot centers on two brothers Gary (Jason Segel) and Walter (voiced
by Peter Linz), one a man and the other a Muppet (either someone was
adopted or theirs something odd going on). The two along with Gary&#x27;s
longtime girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) travel to Los Angeles to find The
Muppets are no longer together. After uncovering a nefarious plan to
level the Muppet theater, Walter seeks out Kermit the frog to save it.<br /><br />Using &#x22;The Blues Brothers&#x22; plot outline, a large portion of the film
involves getting the gang back together. This is of course peppered
with celebrity cameos and infectious musical numbers with great
results. &#x22;Life&#x27;s a Happy Song&#x22; is a particularly catchy tune. The rest
of the film involves the gang putting out all the stops to save their
beloved theater with a TV telethon.<br /><br />A lot of the time watching The Muppets was like eating mom&#x27;s home made
apple pie during a 15 minute lunch break. It&#x27;s comforting, familiar,
and oh so good, but its sweetness can&#x27;t be savored too quickly. The
story seemed to be in such a hurry that at times it gets contrived. A
lot of it probably has to do with my personal feelings of nostalgia (90
minutes? I would have been happy with 3 hours of Muppets!), part of the
problem however lies with the films coy self-awareness. It&#x27;s funny to
occasionally break the fourth wall or look directly into the camera but
when major hurdles are handled in under 2 minutes the joke wears a
little thin.<br /><br />The problems with the movie are thankfully overshadowed by a cast who
truly care. Amy Adams and Jason Segel who co-wrote the script possess
an obvious admiration for the Muppets. Many of your favorites, while
voiced by different people are still the same goofy little critters we
all grew up with and Walter makes a great addition. I won&#x27;t spoil the
end other than to say I was pleasantly surprised by it. The message was
so profound and heartfelt that I completely forgot that it was being
expressed by a felt puppet.
