WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW : THE MUPPETS<br /><br />ONE-LINE REVIEW : If you liked the Muppet Movies, you&#x27;ll love &#x22;The
Muppets&#x22;<br /><br />RATING: &#x22;Wait for the instant download&#x22; (Rating System: &#x22;Watch it in
theaters&#x22;, &#x22;Wait for the instant download&#x22;, &#x22;Don&#x27;t waste your time&#x22;)<br /><br />Gary (Jason Segel, &#x22;How I Met Your Mother&#x22;) and Walter (a new Muppet
voiced by Peter Linz) are brothers growing up in a small town. Gary
grows but Walter stays the same size. Walter falls in love with the old
&#x22;Muppet Show&#x22; and idolizes them. While Gary falls in love with Mary
(Amy Adams, &#x22;Julie &#x26; Julia&#x22;). The three go on a trip to Hollywood to
see the Muppet Theater where they learn that Tex Richman (Chris Cooper,
&#x22;The Tempest&#x22;) wants to tear down the Muppet Theater to get at oil
beneath the building. Walter, Gary, and Mary have just 48 hours to
round up the old Muppets and put on marathon show to raise the 10
million dollars to save the theater. And we&#x27;re off. . .<br /><br />If you&#x27;re a fan of the original &#x22;Muppet Show&#x22; or the Muppet movies,
then you&#x27;re going to enjoy &#x22;The Muppets.&#x22; The story is a cross between
an old Mickey Rooney and Julie Garland film (&#x22;Hey kids, let&#x27;s put on a
show&#x22;) and &#x22;The Blues Brothers&#x22; (&#x22;Hey, we&#x27;re getting the band back
together&#x22;). The plot is thin and is mainly a vehicle for all the
characters from the original show to come back to the stage and put on
a show as we remember it.<br /><br />There are a number of cameos (including Alan Arkin, Mickey Rooney, Jack
Black, Sarah Silverberg, and more). There are tons of puns. And lots of
inside jokes. One nice thing about the plot is that there are
opportunities for growth for just about every major character. Everyone
learns something about themselves.<br /><br />The movie is rated PG for reasons I don&#x27;t understand. It is as clean
cut as it gets. There may be some concern over explosions. But there is
no swearing and nobody really gets hurt. Well, except the bad guy. I
also noticed a complete absence of the Henson name in the movie (except
a couple images of Jim Henson in pictures on the wall). Since Disney
owns the Muppets I can see why this may be, however costumes were
supplied by Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature shop.<br /><br />This is a very good movie for older fans of the Muppets and a very nice
introduction to the Muppets for a younger generation. But there is no
reason to rush out and see it on the big screen. So, for a simple story
told with love and affection for classic characters I recommend you
&#x22;wait for the instant download.&#x22;
