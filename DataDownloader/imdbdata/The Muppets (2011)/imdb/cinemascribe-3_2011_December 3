There is a specific moment in &#x22;The Muppets&#x22; where the film manages to
pull off that sadly infrequent feat of cinema: It takes that one extra
step beyond it&#x27;s already established level of excellence and into the
pantheon of the classics. <br /><br />The moment is simple- some of the Muppets (led by a motivated Miss
Piggy) have abducted someone (not saying who). They have arrived (as a
group)- prisoner in tow- at Kermit the frog&#x27;s door in the early evening
to explain to him what they have done and to urge him to continue on
with a planned telethon to save the Muppet Theater. One of the
characters points out to Kermit &#x22;You see? You inspired us!&#x22; to which he
replies, horrified, &#x22;To kidnap people!?&#x22;<br /><br />He may be green, he may never give up and he may be an eternal
optimist- but the frog has been around the block a few times and he
knows when things may have gone a step too far. <br /><br />The new film &#x22;The Muppets&#x22; understands that Kermit is wise enough in
the ways of the world to temper his optimism with a sense of
responsibility without losing it. It also understands that the values
of friendship, loyalty, decency and honor are still worth prizing and
that - in today&#x27;s culture of celebrity scandals, obnoxious reality TV
and downbeat news - we need an injection of the aggressive optimism Jim
Henson introduced when he created Kermit and his cohorts all those
years ago.<br /><br />As the story opens, Gary (Jason Segel) and his Muppet brother Walter
are due to head to Hollywood with Gary&#x27;s girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams).
Once there, they stop by the defunct Muppet Theater and discover that a
twisted oil baron (Chris Cooper)has plans to level it in an effort to
drill for some crude located beneath the property. <br /><br />Walter (who adores the Muppets, a group who allowed him to vicariously
fit in when his Muppetness placed distinct differences between himself
and the human beings surrounding him every day of his life) and his
human companions set about reuniting the long separated Muppet gang
,who then decide to put on a show to raise the necessary funds to save
the theater..and perhaps the magic that once made them so beloved. <br /><br />I could describe more, but there&#x27;s really no point. With it&#x27;s catchy
songs (some new, some classic and at least one guaranteed to make even
the most jaded adult eyes misty with memories ), dead on satire of
cinematic devices ( I will never again be able to see a montage unfold
without smiling after this flick) and clever nods to the inherent
absurdity of the staging of production numbers in musicals , merely
reading about this movie could never conceivably do it justice. It&#x27;s
one of those films that needs to be experienced firsthand. <br /><br />&#x22;The Muppets&#x22; is a rare cinematic creature..a film that gets it
absolutely right, understanding the founding principles which made the
titular characters so enduring to begin with while simultaneously
providing a fresh, quirky new narrative in which to reintroduce the
beloved icons of the felt and fur set to another generation of
audiences.<br /><br />At a time when a lot of miserable dreck occupies theaters, saturates
television and fills Netflix cues far and wide, it&#x27;s a breath fresh air
to see a film that gleefully addresses life -with all of it&#x27;s peaks and
valleys -by delivering a sly wink,a knowing smile and exuding unabashed
hopefulness. <br /><br />Whether we&#x27;re four or forty, each of us has inside the desire to find
the Rainbow Connection..and &#x22;The Muppets&#x22; - with it&#x27;s rapid fire in-
jokes, cheerful music and good natured sensibility - taps directly into
that, reminding us of what we learned from Kermit, Piggy, Fozzie ,
Gonzo, Dr.Teeth and the Electric Mayhem, Rowf, Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and
Beaker, the Swedish Chef and the rest to begin with : That
joy,laughter, friendship and love are not only what make it all
worthwhile, they may just be the ingredients necessary to make it work. <br /><br />I am rarely this entertained when I go to the movies. I was blindsided.
Consequently, I rate The Muppets a much deserved ten out of ten.
