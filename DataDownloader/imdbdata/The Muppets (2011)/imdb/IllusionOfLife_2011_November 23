The Muppets is essentially flawless. I know this is a weird way to
start a review, but I feel I should just forego formalities and cut to
the chase. This year has been a fairly disappointing year for movies,
but The Muppets just about makes up for it all by itself. It&#x27;s an
absolutely life-affirming tribute to beloved characters and memories
that should have never been allowed to fade into obscurity, and if you
care at all about movies you need to see this, as soon as possible. <br /><br />Jason Segel, along with co-writer Nicholas Stoller and director James
Bobin have made a film that is just absolutely bursting at the seams
with affection towards the Muppets, and that love and passion has
instantly rocketed this movie to the very top of the list when it comes
to long history of Muppet shows, movies, and even viral videos. The
film is one of the funniest movies I&#x27;ve seen in a long time and
accomplishes this without being crass or cynical; it&#x27;s smart, witty,
and most importantly, completely heartfelt. Jason Segel with his
obvious and undying love for the Muppets is, by all accounts, the most
deserving person to be given creative control of the Muppets since Jim
Henson himself. <br /><br />The original Muppet Movie will always be a timeless classic, and it&#x27;s
charm and legacy will likely never be topped by another Muppet movie.
However, The Muppets is the closest it has ever come, and, due to the
timeliness and poignancy of the story, I would argue that right at this
moment it is more relevant and moving than even the 1979 classic. I was
unable to stop smiling during the entire running time of the movie,
even while tears were coming to my eyes. <br /><br />I know I&#x27;m not really reviewing the movie right now, and I&#x27;m more just
beaming about how much I loved it, but really, I feel it would be a
disservice to go into details about this movie. Simply put, you need to
see it, and if you don&#x27;t you&#x27;re robbing yourself of a truly
extraordinary film experience. This is the most sensational,
inspirational, celebrational, Muppetational movie of the year. Go see
it. Right now. I mean it, go buy tickets for this weekend, and you can
thank me later. <br /><br />A+
