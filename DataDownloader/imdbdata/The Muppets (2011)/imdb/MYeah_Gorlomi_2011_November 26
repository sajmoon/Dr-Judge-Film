The film introduces us to Walter, the world&#x27;s biggest fan of the
Muppets. When he, his big brother Gary (Played by Jason Segel), and
Gary&#x27;s girlfriend Mary (Played by Amy Adams), take a plane trip to
Hollywood, they take a visit to the Muppets studios. However, it&#x27;s
currently in possession of the greedy Tex Richman (Played by Chris
Cooper), and unless the Muppets can raise ten million dollars to buy
back the theater, Richman will tear it down to claim the oil underneath
it. Walter, Gary and Mary find Kermit the Frog and share this
information, and so they rally together to get the whole Muppet gang
back together, and put on a show to raise the money.<br /><br />The Muppets is that gem of a movie that doesn&#x27;t come along very often,
one that had me smiling the entire time. I&#x27;ll get my minor, brief
issues with moments of rushed pacing and characterization out of the
way pretty quickly. You might have thought that Jason Segel and
Nicholas Stoller, of 2008&#x27;s Forgetting Sarah Marshall, would be the
LAST candidates to write a Muppet movie, but what they construct is not
only the funniest movie I&#x27;ve seen all year, and one of the absolute
most entertaining, it&#x27;s also a project with the utmost passion and
heart behind it.<br /><br />There are a lot of laughs in this movie (including some really clever
fourth wall gags), and never does it feel mean spirited for the sake of
being mean spirited. Hilarity without vulgarity. And even at its utmost
random (Such as a rap by Chris Cooper that seems to come out of
nowhere), the humor never feels unwelcome. But it&#x27;s not just humor mind
you, there&#x27;s a heartfelt attention to character, a keen sense of
emotion, and a nostalgic style that perfectly nails that of the old TV
show and movies. But on top of that, they also take time to explore
some interesting ideas in regards to today&#x27;s ideas of stardom and
popularity.<br /><br />But of course, it wouldn&#x27;t be a proper Muppet movie without some great
original songs, and Bret McKenzie of Flight of the Conchords fully
meets that task, and then some. He contributes five (counting that
aforementioned rap by Chris Cooper) original songs to the film,
including &#x22;Man or Muppet&#x22;, a duet with Walter and Gary that plays at a
pivotal scene, and &#x22;Life a Happy Song&#x22;, the beautiful opening and
closing number that is seriously deserving of recognition by the
Academy Awards.<br /><br />I&#x27;ll encourage anyone to see this movie over the Thanksgiving weekend,
and even see it again myself. It&#x27;s just a shame that it had to open so
close to movies like Breaking Dawn Part 1, which will take box office
business that The Muppets so richly deserves.<br /><br />***1/2 out of ****
