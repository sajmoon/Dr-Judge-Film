The Muppets is a fantastic film that brings back the classical Muppets
brilliantly,I would definitely say it would appeal to long time fans
like me but also to young people who never heard of them until now,I
have to say that I had forgotten how much I loved the Muppets until I
saw this film,such fun and lovable characters,I love how they make fun
of themselves throughout the movie,with great musical numbers
(especially Lifes A Happy Song and Man Or Muppet) and a great new
edition of Walter,the Muppets number one fan who is himself a true
Muppet,I can imagine a sequel is in the works.<br /><br />When Walter,Gary (Jason Segal) and Mary (Amy Adams) go to
Hollywood,Walter,who is a huge Muppet fan,visits the Muppets old run
down studio,and a wealthy man,Tex Richman is looking to shut the studio
down the find oil underneath the building,the only way they can stop
him is unless The Muppets can make $10,000,000,Walter tells Kermit The
Frog and he trys to get the old gang back together to out on a telethon
and make the money.
