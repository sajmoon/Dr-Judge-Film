I must admit, I usually write reviews when i am angry, however in this
case, I am writing this review because of pure love for the movie.<br /><br />I went to this movie expecting few laughs and an enjoyable night. My
expectations were met and more. the songs were great, the plot was
classic Hollywood plot but they made fun of it so it didn&#x27;t bother me
at all. I laughed at all the jokes without exception. I didn&#x27;t know the
whole cast so the surprise appearances affected me emotionally. <br /><br />most importantly, I felt that the people who are doing that movie
didn&#x27;t acted on that movie for the money, for the box office or for the
fame, they did it for pure love for the Muppet&#x27;s(most of them anyways)
and I felt that. I was asking my self why I loved this movie? and this
is was the answer I got. As long as these kinds of movies being made,
there is still hope for Hollywood.
