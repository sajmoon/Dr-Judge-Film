Let me tell you about Bandwagon Bob. Prior to me seeing The Muppets, he
went on a rampage about how The Muppets sucked and how it was a musical
like Grease. Obviously he hasn&#x27;t seen a Muppets movie, and what The
Muppets had always excelled at was their songs. This new Muppet movie
is no exception.<br /><br />The movie mostly centers around a new addition to the Muppet crew,
Walter. All of Walter&#x27;s life he wanted to be a part of the other Muppet
crew with Kermit the Frog and all of them ever since he first watched
The Muppet Show (something I fondly remember watching with my family
back in the eighties). One day, Walter is invited by his caretakers
(Jason Segel and the gorgeous Amy Adams) to California to see the
studio where they filmed The Muppet Show, well, Walter is ecstatic.
They even sing about it! But then things take a turn for the worst when
The Muppets&#x27; old studio is threatened to be taken over by a ruthless
business tycoon (Chris Cooper) and must raise ten million dollars at a
telethon to win it back. Reminds me of that Weird Al Yankovich movie
UHF.<br /><br />Throughout the way, the film is riddled with great songs and very funny
scenes. The film isn&#x27;t shy about breaking the fourth wall. The best
moments for me is towards the end where nostalgia sets in with The
Muppet Show. I swear I had chills. Also, I love the chemistry between
Jason Segel and Amy Adams. After getting to California, they clearly
don&#x27;t have much purpose left in the film, but their chemistry is so
good that it doesn&#x27;t even matter.<br /><br />The only faults I found was that the story seemed a little rushed, and
the forced happy ending somewhat ticked me off. I don&#x27;t want to give
anything away, but the forced resolution with a newspaper clipping
wasn&#x27;t necessary. It was fine the way it was.<br /><br />However, The Muppets are back (hopefully the box office allows it) and
I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Bandwagon Bob was wrong. The Muppets ruled!
