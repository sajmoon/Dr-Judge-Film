Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t very much enjoy this movie, first of all I
thought it was more like a musical with all the happy happy joy joy
songs; of course that is part of the Muppets but it was too much in my
opinion.<br /><br />The plot was very simple and not very interesting, pretty clich&#xE9;
actually...we&#x27;ve seen it a thousand times and this was just another
love story without excitement...<br /><br />The muppets were pretty funny, but I was hoping for an ending with a
bit more of the standard Muppet Show scenes like the Swedish Chef or
Pigs in Space; for old times sake! No, it was pretty short and not very
entertaining in my humble opinion; I was disappointed.<br /><br />Of course it still are the Muppets, but just rent the DVD/Blu-ray and
watch it at home from the couch...I wish I did.
