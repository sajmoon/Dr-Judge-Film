The Muppets have been and always will be amazing. Take this film as a
prime example.<br /><br />The movie opens to the life of Walter (Linz), a Muppet, and Gary
(Segel), his human brother. As they grow up, they develop a love for
The Muppet Show. Eventually they end up going to LA with Mary (Adams),
Gary&#x27;s girlfriend and taking a tour at the Muppets studio, where Walter
discovers an oil tycoon&#x27;s (Cooper) plan to destroy the theatre and
drill it. He, Gary, and Mary, decide to visit Kermit and convince the
Muppets to get back together for one last show to save the theatre.<br /><br />This film also has short appearances with Jack Black (The School of
Rock) and Jim Parsons (The Big Bang Theory).<br /><br />This movie has many of the elements that just scream, &#x22;Oh my gosh! It&#x27;s
The Muppets!&#x22;. Which include covers of popular songs, and explosions.
Even the original characters still have the same physical and
personality traits, as they did from the start of the very first
episode of this show, to the end of the film. They also were able to
incorporate every character from the show into this film. <br /><br />The acting is very interesting, as the characters in the movie pretend
that The Muppets are no longer popular, when the franchise is still a
huge part of pop-culture. They even act as though Kermit never existed,
when everyone in reality knows who he is. This could probably happen
two hundred years later in the future, but not now.<br /><br />The actors make you think that they believe the Muppets are actual
real-life beings that can communicate, and think the way they always
have.<br /><br />This flick will be thoroughly enjoyed by many kinds of people
including, hardcore fans and young children who endlessly beg their
parents to see this movie at their local theatre. Seeing as it has a
mixture of comedy, drama, and catchy music scores. <br /><br />It is one of those movies where you go into the theatre thinking,
&#x22;Alright, there is probably nothing special about this film,&#x22; and come
out singing one of their songs as they leave after the credits appear.<br /><br />I give this movie a 9/10.
