The Muppets (1:43, PG) &#x97; other: talking animals, 3rd string, sequel,
OSIT romantics<br /><br />My reviews are totally subjective. I say what *I* think, how *I* react,
and so you may wish to take this one with a grain of salt.<br /><br />I unabashedly love the Muppets. Did going in. Did coming out.<br /><br />Apparently I&#x27;m not the only one. Here&#x27;s a link to what I consider the
best TV commercial of all time:
&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX9GTUMh490 It features brief
appearances by Thomas Edison, Bucky Fuller, Martha Graham, Pablo
Picasso, and Albert Einstein, but notice whose picture shows up when
they drop the word &#x22;genius&#x22;.<br /><br />I&#x27;m guessing that Alan Arkin, Jack Black, Emily Blunt, James Carville,
Zach Galifianakis, Whoopi Goldberg, Selena Gomez, Neil Patrick Harris,
Jim Parsons, Mickey Rooney, Kristen Schaal, and Sarah Silverman all
agree, because each of them signed on for a cameo appearance.<br /><br />The plot is paper-thin. The idea is to reunite the Muppets to save
their old, cobwebby, dilapidated theater from being torn down by the
subtly named Tex Richman (Chris Cooper), who wants the oil beneath it.
It&#x27;s basically &#x22;Let&#x27;s put on a show.&#x22; And so they do. They sing. They
dance. They drum. They blow things up.<br /><br />The catalysts for the reunion are 2 brothers, Gary (Jason Segel) and
Walter (a muppet voiced by Peter Linz), and Gary&#x27;s long-time girlfriend
Mary (adorable, endearing Amy Adams, a human muppet perfectly cast as
literally a Smalltown sweetheart). I haven&#x27;t been a fan of Segel as an
actor, nor was I fond of his performance here, but he gets huge props
as screenwriter (along with Nicholas Stoller) and executive producer;
apparently it was a labor of love for him, too. Steve Whitmire voices
Kermit the Frog plus 4 others; Eric Jacobson does Miss Piggy and Fozzie
Bear + 3; and Dave Goelz does Gonzo + 5. They are all fine.<br /><br />The movie is corny, slapstick, juvenile, and unabashedly sentimental.
Production design is basically plywood and terrycloth. There are lots
of tunes, all effective in context, but the only truly memorable one is
a reprise of &#x22;Rainbow Connection&#x22;. There are sight gags, puns,
onomatopoetic smilers, and a wealth of metahumor. There are many
laff-out-loud moments and more than one where I found myself blubbering
like a baby. For good, clean, wholesome fun, it can&#x27;t be beat. I&#x27;m not
sure where the &#x22;P&#x22; In front of &#x22;G&#x22; came from, maybe it means that
parents shouldn&#x27;t miss it.<br /><br />I love these guys.<br /><br />BONUS: The feature is preceded by a terrific cartoon in which one of
the Toy Story characters gets misplaced on a trip to the fast-food
Poultry Palace.
