I live in Texas and felt uncomfortable watching this movie with my 5
year old. The movie includes ugly stereotyping against Texans,
particularly against those working in the oil and gas industry.<br /><br />It is hard for me to understand the use of the word &#x22;Tex&#x22; in Tex
Richman, which is depicted as a rich but miserable oilman. The Tex
Richman works at the top of a high rise with nasty looking muppets and
keeps courtesans in his closet. He plans to drill for oil under the
Muppets Theater, which would be in downtown LA somewhere according to
the movie.<br /><br />The movie is full of misrepresentations. The worst is these
misrepresentations are made to children who cannot judge them, and to
unsuspecting parents who think they are taking their kids to a harmless
holiday movie.<br /><br />It is unfortunate how The Muppets movie can be used as a platform for
cheap political propaganda. The producers of this movie likely consume
energy just like the rest of the Americans, without having much regard
for where it comes from. I wish people stopped pointing fingers calling
each other Tex Richmen, or Tree Huggers, and really thought about
solutions for the nation&#x27;s energy needs. In any case, The Muppets movie
is probably not the best platform for this debate.
