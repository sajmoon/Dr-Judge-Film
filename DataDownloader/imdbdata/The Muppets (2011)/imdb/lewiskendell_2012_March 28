Delightful. That word describes The Muppets &#xA0;better than any other word
that readily comes to mind. This movie is fun, funny and charming in a
way that easily appeals to kids and adults. That pretty much sums up my
review, but IMDb insists on more content in their user reviews than
that, so I&#x27;ll give a bit more detail.&#xA0;<br /><br />The story is a simple one, with the Muppets getting back together after
drifting their separate ways to put on a huge show to save their old
theater. A new Muppet, Walter, his human brother Gary (Jason Segal) and
Gary&#x27;s girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) take a trip to Los Angeles that
sparks the whole storyline. Segal and Adams are great, singing and
charming their way through the movie while leaving plenty of space for
the Muppets to be the clear stars of the show. Celebrity cameos are
numerous and usually hilarious.&#xA0;<br /><br />The frequent songs are catchy and amusing (&#x22;Me Party&#x22; was pretty much
the highlight of the whole film in my opinion), the dynamics and
chemistry between the Muppets seem as good as ever, and best of all,
it&#x27;s almost impossible to not have a smile on your face while watching
The Muppets. I didn&#x27;t enjoy the movie so much that I was oblivious to
its flaws, though. The pacing suffered at times, the movie peaked too
early for me (the first 70% was better than the last act), Chris Cooper
was largely mishandled as the villainous Tex Richman (great name, by
the way), and the ending fizzled. Oh, and there wasn&#x27;t nearly enough
Amy Adams, but I&#x27;m willing to admit that&#x27;s probably just an issue on my
end (she&#x27;s one of my favorite actresses).&#xA0;<br /><br />Still, those issues didn&#x27;t change the fact that I enjoyed The Muppets a
lot. Be you an old fan or a newcomer, give it a shot.&#xA0;
