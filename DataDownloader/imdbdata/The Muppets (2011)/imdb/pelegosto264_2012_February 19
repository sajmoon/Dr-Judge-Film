While it seems that the muppets are back, they never really have left.
There were of course a lot of TV-movies made in between treasure island
and this one. And most of them were not that good. This movie borrows
probably from all other muppet movies. Is that bad? No, because it is
done right. So don&#x27;t expect a great story, you know where it is going
after watching it for about 5 minutes. Yet, it is so entertaining! A
true muppet movie. A real shame that Frank Oz did not want to
participate (I can understand that since his script did not make it to
the final film). I think the only real bad thing is that one of the
writers is also an actor. Jason Segel wrote a nice script... but if you
also let an actor write, you can make sure that he will appear in shots
where he is not needed at all. And that is exactly what happened. All
that is left to say is: MORE MORE
