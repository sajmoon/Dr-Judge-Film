There are very few of us twenty-somethings who grew up without the
Muppets. Between Sesame Street, Muppet Show reruns, and videocassettes
of the various Muppet movies, we saw these guys all the time. We even
had one or two theatrical releases of our own during the &#x27;90s. (My
personal favorite of those is The Muppet Christmas Carol, which is
still annual holiday viewing.) In recent years, since the very
underwhelming Muppets from Space, we&#x27;ve seen them pop up now and again,
mostly in similarly underwhelming TV projects and in short (yet
hilarious!) YouTube videos. I am quite happy to say that, in this
newest movie, the Muppets are back in a big way! <br /><br />The movie starts by introducing us to a new Muppet, Walter, and his
strangely human brother Gary. Gary has planned a trip with his
girlfriend, Mary, to Los Angeles, and he is taking Walter along to
visit the home of his heroes, Muppet Studios. They find the studio to
be in disrepair, and hear of an evil plot to destroy it. Can the
Muppets, and everything we hold dear about them, be saved? To get my
one complaint out of the way, I do feel that this movie was a bit
rushed in places. I wanted more time with these awesome characters, and
it did feel as if they were trying to get from one place to the next a
bit too quickly.<br /><br />That said, I spent nearly the entire movie with a smile on my face.
These are the Muppets that I grew up with, doing what they are best at
doing, with that gently edgy humor at which they have always excelled.
While there are some moments that are very touching, it is mostly very
funny, with lots of nods to The Muppet Show and The Muppet Movie. While
new little Muppet fans should enjoy this, it will be much more
meaningful to those who have a history with Kermit and Co.<br /><br />Clearly made with love for Jim Henson and his creations of fur and
felt, The Muppets is the most delightful movie I&#x27;ve seen in theaters
this year.
