While I love Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo and the other muppets of
all shapes and sizes because it has been such a loooooong time since I
last saw them, and that Amy Adams and Jason Segel are utterly adorable
(watch especially for Adams&#x27; and Miss Piggy&#x27;s rendition of Me Party),
that the finale &#x22;Rainbow Connection&#x22; can cause teary eyes, and the
cameos by Jack Black, Whoopi Goldberg, Selena Gomez, Emily Blunt,
amongst others, are priceless and thoroughly entertaining, one can&#x27;t
wipe off the feeling that The Muppets is going to be no more than a
one-off nostalgic ride down memory lane for those who grew up with
them, and as much it is a tribute to Jim Henson, is unfortunately
largely irrelevant to today&#x27;s kids who grew up on a diet of CGI,
coolness and cell phones. The age of technology, the dearth of
nostalgia.
