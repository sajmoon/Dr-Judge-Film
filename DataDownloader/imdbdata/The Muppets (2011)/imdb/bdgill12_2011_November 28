I live my life by a simple creed that has worked fairly well for me
over the years: anything that involves the Muppets is better than it
would be without the Muppets. It&#x27;s just that simple. If you have a
concept, whether it is a film, TV show, or life plan, just add Kermit
and I would say your concept will be bettered by a solid 21 percent.
Case in point: Muppet Babies: better than regular babies. Babies cry,
sleep, and poop all day (says the guy who&#x27;s a little bit afraid of
babies); Muppet Babies, on the other hand, sing, dance, and create
glorious imaginary dreamscapes in which they take the form of Star Wars
characters. This is a no brainer. Needless to say, I&#x27;m a big fan of the
Muppets. I don&#x27;t trust people who don&#x27;t like the Muppets because,
honestly, how is that possible? This seems un-American. I mean, if you
don&#x27;t like the Muppets, I&#x27;d expect you&#x27;re also not such a big fan of
apple pie, baseball, and, you know, constitutionalized freedoms. <br /><br />Walter and Gary (Jason Segel) are as close as brothers can be despite
their obvious differences. Gary is a near lummox of a man while Walter
is a Muppet. Growing up, Walter is obsessed with the Muppets and
whenever things get tough, Gary always cheers up his little brother by
watching the famous TV show with him. When Gary plans a trip to Los
Angeles with his fianc&#xE9;e Mary (Amy Adams), he invites Walter along for
a tour of the Muppet Studios. But when they get to their destination,
Walter finds the studios to be in severe disrepair and completely
devoid of Muppets. To make matters worse, he overhears a conversation
involving oil tycoon Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) describing his plot to
take over the studio and tear it to the ground. Distraught, Walter and
Gary track down Kermit the Frog to warn him of the studio&#x27;s impending
doom. With limited funds available, the trio must get the old band back
together in order to put together a Muppet telethon to save the studio.<br /><br />From start to finish, The Muppets is about as much fun as you could
possibly ask for in a movie. Segel&#x27;s script (along with the help of
Nick Stoller) is a delightfully nostalgic piece of work that not only
pays homage to the Muppet way of old but revels in it, making the
decidedly retro feel of the film&#x27;s humor seem like a breath of fresh
air. I love sarcasm as much as the next guy but to come across a movie
that is genuinely funny without becoming snarky or mean-spirited in the
slightest is a rarity these days. At the same time, the vast majority
of the bits and jokes aren&#x27;t near as easy as I thought they might be.
Very little within The Muppets is what you would call witty but that
doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t smart; it is just straightforward comedy that
should appeal to both adults and children without any problem. <br /><br />The story itself is a simple one as the tale of getting the Muppets
back together and putting on one big show takes up the majority of the
film&#x27;s narrative and isn&#x27;t in and of itself exceedingly original. But
as a Muppet fan, it is a narrative that I greatly appreciated and I
would imagine that&#x27;s exactly how Segel felt as he wrote it. I would
love for the Muppets to get back together and become relevant again and
that&#x27;s an overriding theme throughout the movie. Segel and director
Jason Bobin know that this is somewhat of a last chance for the Muppets
as a whole; if this movie succeeds, we&#x27;ll soon be talking about sequels
and a rejuvenation of the Muppet brand; if it fails, Kermit and the
gang will be reduced to nothing more than a fond memory that may never
again capture the imagination of a generation. This leads to a sort of
self- awareness, making The Muppets almost a movie within a movie and
that element is one that brought me absolute joy and leads to a number
of hilarious moments that had me and the entire audience cackling. <br /><br />In addition, there&#x27;s an extreme liveliness to The Muppets that I would
say bests anything done in the previous Muppet films. As Kermit gets
the group back together, we get to see the Muppets at their worst:
Fozzy is playing in a cover band (called The Moopets) in Reno, Gonzo
has put away the childishness of youth and become a toilet businessman,
and Animal is no longer allowed to drum because it triggers his rage.
It&#x27;s cool to see the Muppets in a different setting than we&#x27;re used to
and it makes their final production all the more special. And speaking
of the music, each and every number, from the delightful &#x22;Man or
Muppet&#x22; to the shocking- but-hilarious rap song to the inevitable but
no less satisfying singing of &#x22;The Rainbow Connection&#x22;, are all
exquisite. Bret McKenzie (from Flight of the Conchords) did a masterful
job of constructing smart, entertaining songs that both progress the
film and stand alone as fun and addicting tunes that will almost
certainly pop up on my iPod from time to time. <br /><br />The finished product plays as a Pixar-like version of the Muppets with
a little bit of Flight of the Conchords mixed in for good measure (this
ingredient should come as no surprise since both Bobin and McKenzie
made their names through that show). The Muppets is riotous, uproarious
fun and thoroughly refreshing and balances the perfect amount of heart
and comedy. It is, in many ways, a passion project and that excitement
oozes through in every wonderfully constructed scene. It stands as my
favorite film of the year thus far and holds up against any
non-animated family film of the last decade (or more).
