It may not have the elements of the original, but this is a very family
friendly film, with something for everyone. Leave your prejudices at
the door, ignore the niggles about characters and those involved, just
go with it, let yourself go and have a fun time! <br /><br />We went as a family, from the youngest to the oldest, and everyone got
something from the film. The smallest child sat giggling throughout the
film, my Mum, pushing 70, was wiping away tears of laughter. Everyone
laughed out loud, enjoyed the whole experience, and we had a great
time. <br /><br />There were a couple of things I could have lived without, I found the
human characters a tad over twee, and their songs a bit much, but they
moved things along, and the kids enjoyed those parts.<br /><br />The chickens singing &#x22;Forget You&#x22; had me crying with laughter in my
seat thinking of the original Cee Lo Green title.<br /><br />Overall, I think the best thing to say about the film is Mahna Mahna!
Maniacal laugh, maniacal laugh, maniacal laugh!
