The Muppets are back once again in a slick and average film which I
thought worked and didn&#x27;t at some points. Note to anyone who doesn&#x27;t
like my review here has to hear me out. I did NOT hate this film nor do
I think it was badly made, I just thought that there was some screw up
and it wasn&#x27;t what it used to be like. The Muppet Show and Muppet films
which ran from the 60&#x27;s all the way till the early 2000&#x27;s was a great
dose of fun, everything was played out well to an extent and it was
always memorable. This new film is an OK take on but by the end of it,
it was nothing but &#x22;yes, this was good&#x22;. When I watched the other
Muppet films as a kid, I watched them over and over again (That being
Muppets from Space). Anyway, I will point out what I found positive and
negative about this film. I didn&#x27;t hate it but I certainly don&#x27;t think
it&#x27;s at it&#x27;s predecessors levels (such as Muppet Christmas Carol or
Muppets Take Manhatton).<br /><br />This plot is told really simply.... With the help of three fans, The
Muppets must reunite to save their old theater from a greedy oil
tycoon. That being Gary, his brother Walter and his girlfriend Mary.<br /><br />Positives: I thought that the messages sent across to each characters
was really heart-warming and we could really get a taste of what they
were really feeling. We could also connect to them in some ways.<br /><br />I found the sing-alongs really fun and enjoyable (only Muppets
singing). I don&#x27;t usually like that type of stuff but this film did it
for me really well. I also thought some of the voice acting was
particularly good and I was surprised since most of the actors who
portrayed them before have left. The new actors actually did OK. On a
positive note as, I was laughing most of my way through this film and I
was surprised about how much I laughed at it. The use of cameos as well
was a clever idea. The concept I found most interesting about this film
was how the film poked fun at itself and related back to it&#x27;s original
stuff back in the 70&#x27;s. Really kicked up a vibe there which I was
really impressed with.<br /><br />Negatives: Even though i loved this film, this film does have many
problems which some film these days in general lack. First off, this
film was not as good as most of the older movies which went through the
70&#x27;s-early 2000&#x27;s era.<br /><br />First off, Disney has gotten itself into many shambles and it has
really become a bad filmmaking/TV show company. I mean what happen to
their awesome films? Well they&#x27;ve taken the Muppets to a level which it
doesn&#x27;t have that everyone feel. Sure this film does have many laughs
but they are soon forgotten once we still think about the older films.
Disney just went a bit too much on the lighting, look, feel and tone of
it. I liked the old looking cinematography and the time were there
weren&#x27;t all these people around just taking the spot light away from
the Muppet&#x27;s. If you&#x27;re gonna do a film or show about these characters,
you have to have them in the spot light. Not the human actors. I
believe Amy Adams and Jason Segal did an excellent job. They were&#x27;nt
the problem. It was that first starting song and last starting song
where we only had like three Muppet&#x27;s singing while there were a
thousand humans? What the heck???? I didn&#x27;t get that at all.<br /><br />In conclusion, I didn&#x27;t think this was a bad film nor do I think it was
the best of the bunch. I thought this film was gonna blow badly but I
was surprised at what it turned out to be like. The film by the way is
really well paced and I found the sets good. The overall problem really
is it&#x27;s just not I was used to. I mean I guess I have to move on but
The Muppets is something I have liked dearly. But oh well. I would
rather watch this than Muppet Treasure Island (which I think is OK) but
not the others. Overall also, this Muppet film was a good/bad film and
it had some potential going for it. By the way I also found the voice
actor for Ms. Piggy and Fozzie really dodgy. The voices kept going high
pitched and then low. I really noticed that which wasn&#x27;t good.<br /><br />My friend did not like this film at all. He found it funny, but nothing
new to him and at thought, thinks that this new film was bad in many
ways. I can except it for what it is but if you are a real die hard fan
of the Muppets, you will either love or hate. I found it in the middle
7/10
