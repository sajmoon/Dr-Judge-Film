I went with a small group of friends to see this during opening
weekend. We all like the Muppets and were hopeful, but not expecting
anything. We were all thrilled with it. Funny, smart, modern, Muppety,
nostalgic and I think a perfect kick start to the Muppets. The best
Muppet movie since the original three for certain! Several of us are
going back to see it again. Also, some of the songs in the soundtrack
are impossible to get out of your head. For anyone who hasn&#x27;t kept up
with the Muppets recently, most of the characters are performed by new
puppeteers, with some exceptions. I think this is the best that Kermit
has been since the late Jim Henson performed him. Also, scooter who was
absent for so long is back and sounds his best. Only a few times did
Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear sound &#x22;off&#x22; to me, which was distracting in
the moment, but overall they were great. Really, the only misstep in
writing seemed to be Fozzie&#x27;s fart shoes joke, which could have been
acceptable if someone like Kermit replied with a &#x22;Really? Fozzie?&#x22;
etc... Instead, it sort of hung there as a particularly poor taste joke
for Fozzie. I saw this show in a large theater which was mostly full
and it appeared everyone loved it. Lot&#x27;s of laughter and applause at
the end!
