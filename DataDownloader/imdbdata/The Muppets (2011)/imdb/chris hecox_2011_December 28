I read that Frank Oz didn&#x27;t do any voice for this film... It didn&#x27;t
matter, and I didn&#x27;t notice. It was wonderful. I was truly blown away
by how cleverly written this story was. If there is any method to
bringing back a &#x22;dead&#x22; franchise, this is the way to do it. Countless
other franchises have tried (Transformers) and only succeeded to an
extent. (What Michael Bay? Your characters need... character?)<br /><br />This movie is done so well, and although my knowledge of the Muppets
was limited to time spent with them in the Muppets Christmas Carol, and
Muppet Treasure Island, I felt like I connected back with the old days
of the Muppet Show... Days that I hadn&#x27;t even experienced before!<br /><br />I&#x27;ll warn you though, this movie is so corny... But it&#x27;s about old
talking puppets, so it easily gets away with it. I was slightly worried
in the beginning, but after about 15 minutes, I knew I was set for a
great film. The leading roles definitely play supporting roles, if that
makes any sense. It is a film about the muppets, so about the muppets
it stayed, and there was no better way to do it. The new Muppet, Walter
is just as lovable as the rest, and rest assured, you will leave this
film quoting it and laughing about it with your friends or family. It&#x27;s
really a fun romp through the past, so find two hours in your life to
go enjoy this film. It&#x27;s really great!<br /><br />Don&#x27;t let any Muppet haters tell you otherwise... They have no souls.
