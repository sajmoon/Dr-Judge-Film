If the goal of making &#x22;The Muppets&#x22; was to make a very fun, enjoyable
movie, then they succeeded in every way. Of course, the movie also
brings up the issue of nostalgia, but it&#x27;s mostly an hour and a half of
fun. Even the musical numbers were kind of neat, and I&#x27;m not someone
who usually goes for musicals. As with the previous movies, they
sprinkle the movie with cameos and bit parts by famous people in
addition to Kermit, Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, etc, and the main stars.
Seriously, it&#x27;s just a movie that you gotta love. Does the movie have
any downside? Maybe the occasional low humor, but everything else more
than makes up for that. It&#x27;s one for the ages!
