&#xA8;Am I a Muppet, or am I a man? If I&#x27;m a man, I&#x27;m a Muppet of a man. &#xA8;<br /><br />James Bobin was perhaps barely known for his work as a writer in TV
series such as Da Ali G Show and The Flight of the Conchords, but after
his direction in his first feature film, The Muppets, he will be
recognized and remembered for bringing back the 70&#x27;s film and TV series
back to life. Bobin has accomplished what I thought in today&#x27;s advanced
technological world couldn&#x27;t be done: bring back the Muppets to popular
mainstream and make them stars all over again. This film was a very
pleasant surprise and didn&#x27;t just work only as a nostalgic piece, but
it also managed to convert new fans with some catchy songs and great
cameos. Whoever thought the Muppets were done and over with was wrong,
because they&#x27;ve really made millions of new fans and there movie was on
par with their greatest shows in the eighties. Seeing these characters
back in the big screen without any use of animated effects and just
being their old selves was such a great feeling. It allowed for a
better story to be told and not just rely on the special effects like
so many animated films do now a day. The spirit of Jim Henson is still
alive and he would&#x27;ve been pleased with this latest effort. One of the
reasons this film worked so well was thanks to the funny script which
was written by Jason Segel (who also stars in this film) and Nicholas
Stoller. Segel had already proved to be a great writer when he wrote
the hilarious Forgetting Sarah Marshall. At the end of that film we
came to know about his characters passion for directing a Muppet opera.
Perhaps it is really a dream of his and he got close to achieving it
with this film. The question I&#x27;ll have to ask Segel is if he is a
Muppet or a man.<br /><br />Gary (Jason Segel) and Walter (muppet voiced by Peter Linz) have been
very close since they were born. The two brothers always spend time
together and one of their favorite hobby&#x27;s is watching The Muppets on
television. Walter admires the muppets and dreams of meeting them, and
one day Gary decides to take him to their Theater in Los Angeles. Gary
is actually going to LA to celebrate his tenth year together with
girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams), but he convinces Mary to let Walter come
with them. Once they arrive at the Museum, they are torn to see the
place abandoned and no muppet in sight. While Walter is touring
Kermit&#x27;s old office he overhears a conversation an oil tycoon named Tex
Richman (Chris Cooper) is having, saying that he is going to buy the
abandoned theater and extract oil from under the sacred place. Walter
is terrified after hearing this and decides to search for Kermit in
order to let him know about Richman&#x27;s evil plans. The only way to save
the theater is to come up with ten million dollars before the end of
the week. Gary, Mary, and Walter find Kermit and tell him they still
have time to come up with the money if the Muppets get back together
and raise the money. That is when Kermit begins enlisting every one of
the muppets one by one and preparing a lived telecast show to raise the
money. Veronica Martin (Rashida Jones) decides to produce the show
despite believing the Muppets are history because their hottest show
got canceled and they need something to cover the hole, but she says
they will need a star to host the show. The Muppets find Jack Black and
convince him (by kidnapping him) to do it against his will. Thus the
show begins and the race against the clock to raise the money.<br /><br />The comedy along with the musicals in The Muppets work to perfection. I
loved every one of the songs in this movie, and Kermit&#x27;s single was so
good. Jason Segel and Amy Adams have a special chemistry together.
Adams reminds us why we fell in love with Enchanted and Jason Segel
plays his useful lovable self. It was such a nostalgic feeling to see
The Muppets back in action, but they were great as always. Kermit, Miss
Piggy, Gonzo, Animal, Fozzie, Beaker, Rowlf, and company were all
spectacular. These are the characters I grew up with so it was really
something to see them together once again in such a well written and
entertaining movie. Perhaps the weakest part was the villain; Chris
Cooper is a great actor but his character was a little over the top.
The best part of the film in my opinion was the cameos. I absolutely
loved each one of them, but I don&#x27;t want to give away any surprises. My
favorite was the cameo from the &#xA8;Am I a Muppet or a Man&#xA8; song. This is
a movie for everyone, fans of the old series and young kids will enjoy
this alike. The Muppets is one of the pleasant surprises from 2011.
It&#x27;s definitely worth a watch.<br /><br />http://estebueno10.blogspot.com
