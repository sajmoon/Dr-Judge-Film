First off, heres a little description of the movie. It&#x27;s not what you
might think. Also, there will be no spoilers in this review. It starts
off with a puppet and a young boy playing together, which appears to be
on an old projector. It shows various clips of the boy getting older,
and the puppet stays the same. However, it&#x27;s funny because they treat
him like a normal person. When it goes to a few years later, he first
sees the muppets and feels a great connection to them. When it goes to
the present day, the older brother is going to Los Angelas with his
girlfriend, and the Muppet comes along to see the studio. However, the
studio is about to be destroyed! He must find all the Muppets in a last
chance to save the theater. Don&#x27;t worry, this is all revealed within
the first 20-30 minutes of the movie. There is a lot of music, funny
scenes and those jokes that they make fun of the fact that they know
they are in a movie. If you want something to go see this holiday,
don&#x27;t miss out on this one!
