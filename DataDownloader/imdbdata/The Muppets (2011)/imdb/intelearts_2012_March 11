It&#x27;s not often we get to watch a film we can all enjoy but with the
Muppet movie we did - the youngest, twins aged 7, wanted more muppets
(and who can blame them), and the older, aged 9, loved it from
beginning to end.<br /><br />It&#x27;s full of nostalgic moments and yes we too get that Jason Siegel
dominates the film but the songs were fun, the sense of hope and
triumph invigorating, and it did what you hoped for - bought up old,
happy memories, and created some new ones.<br /><br />All in all, if you&#x27;re looking for a family film you can all enjoy then
the Muppets certainly fits the bill - just wish there had been enough
more silliness from the Muppets themselves, but we really enjoyed it.
