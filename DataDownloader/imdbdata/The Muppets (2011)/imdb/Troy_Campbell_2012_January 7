Disclosure: I&#x27;ve never seen any Muppet shows or movies before. I&#x27;m what
you would call &#x27;uninitiated&#x27;. After 103 minutes of watching Kermit and
friends get their careers back on track in The Muppets (their last
noteworthy effort being 1992&#x27;s The Muppet Christmas Carol), chalk me up
as a fan. From the innocent humour to the lyrically clever musical
numbers &#x96; the &#x27;Am I a Muppet or a Man?&#x27; ballad at the midway point is a
highlight &#x96; this return to public consciousness for Jim Henson&#x27;s
puppets is a fun-filled one. Star, co-writer and self-confessed
Muppet-obsessive Jason Segal is essentially the sole reason this film
got off the ground, and in the lead human role of Gary, he is clearly
having a blast; as is perennial sweet girl Amy Adams as his girlfriend
Mary. With a multitude of cameos ranging from old-timers Mickey Rooney
and Alan Arkin to younger celebs like Emily Blunt and John Krasinski,
this comeback event ticks all the right boxes and is sure to put a
smile on your face.
