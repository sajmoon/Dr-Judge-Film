I&#x27;ve been a huge Muppet fan ever since I was a child. I grew up
watching them, in particular the original Jim Henson movies (The Muppet
Movie (1979), The Great Muppet Caper (1981) and The Muppets Take
Manhattan (1984)). As I got older and I became interested in
filmmaking, I discovered how the Muppets were done. When I found out
how the puppetry was involved, I found a new reason as to why I love
them. I love them not only because of my childhood, but also because of
how much work goes into making these movies or shows. With today&#x27;s
rising technology and use of CGI, it&#x27;s refreshing to go back and look
at old movies that use more hand made techniques. These techniques can
still be used, but many decide not to for reasons I don&#x27;t need to
explain. I digress though. <br /><br />It&#x27;s been 12 years since the last Muppet movie and since it&#x27;s been 21
years since the death of Jim Henson. Ever since then, The Muppets have
slowly declined and not much has been seen from them. One has to wonder
how a new movie would do in today&#x27;s age. I mean Jim Henson is a hero of
mine and to see another movie released without his involvement is kind
of sad. Although, the intention behind this picture was to bring back
the Henson quality that&#x27;s been missing. Did it exceed? <br /><br />To me, the movie not only exceeds, but goes above and beyond anything
The Muppets have done since Henson&#x27;s death. The original characters are
great as always, but I thought Jason Segal, Amy Adams and the new
Muppet, Walter, were all excellent editions. You can tell Segal, Nick
Stoller and James Bobin really wanted to capture that magic and that
they knew who these characters were and how Henson would&#x27;ve done it. <br /><br />One thing they exceeded in the most is the depiction of these
characters. This time around, they have such emotional depth and
character development. Probably more this than in any other Muppet
movie I&#x27;ve seen. These character are merely puppets and they not only
give them life, but also a soul. That&#x27;s not to say Henson didn&#x27;t give
them soul. He most certainly did, but here the characters are dealing
with something that one never thought could happen: people have
forgotten them. <br /><br />This is where the film really pulls on the heart strings. It&#x27;s been
years since The Muppets have been on the big screen and this movie
knows that. It shows how things have changed through the years and how
the world has become adapted to watching unoriginal material in both
film and television and that there&#x27;s nothing fresh. It almost like a
commentary on our society. I&#x27;m not trying to get deep with a family
film, but that&#x27;s the impression I got when I saw the movie. <br /><br />It&#x27;s things like these that make the film work very well. The story is
simple, but it&#x27;s how the filmmakers attacked it that made it so good.
Plus, it pays homage to Henson with the same meta humor and irrelevant
jokes. It makes us remember why we love these characters and why it&#x27;s
good to have them back. I also enjoyed both the new and old songs and
musical numbers. All the songs were obvious nods to the original Henson
movies. <br /><br />Overall, I loved this movie. I felt like a kid again, especially in the
last half hour. I felt like I was in the audience of the Muppet
theater, watching them live, rather than seeing a movie. Is better than
the Henson movies? I have to say no, but it&#x27;s just as good and comes
closer to that magic than the Post-Henson movies. I think that&#x27;s
because you can&#x27;t duplicate something that&#x27;s so well known. I think Jim
Henson would be proud to know that his characters, as well as puppetry,
still have a life. To me, this is a comeback for not only the
character, but also the art of puppetry. <br /><br />Here&#x27;s how I rank all the Muppet movies: <br /><br />1. The Muppet Movie (1979) 2. The Muppets Take Manhattan (1984) 3. The
Great Muppet Caper (1981) 4. The Muppets (2011) 5. Muppet Christmas
Carol (1992) 6. Muppet Treasure Island (1996) 7. Muppets From Space
(1999)
