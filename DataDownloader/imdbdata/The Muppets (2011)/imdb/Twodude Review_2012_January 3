As I have said many times before, when reviewing a family movie, I look
at it from a variety of perspectives; first, is it appropriate for my
three kids? Second, are I and my kids being entertained? And finally,
is there a decent storyline? <br /><br />The Muppets stars Jason Segel, co-star of Forgetting Sarah Marshall and
the hit T.V. Series How I Met Your Mother. Segal, a long time fan that
had grown up watching The Muppets, only to see them face into
obscurity, co-wrote the screenplay for the film. I applaud him for his
genuine love of the characters and the care he took in bringing them
into the present. The Muppets is a truly entertaining movie! I&#x27;m glad
that I had an opportunity to take my kids to see something that I had
grown up on and how enjoyable it was to me. As I go on a tangent,
without spoiling the movie; The Muppets popularity shrunk as animation
grew and the human element of children&#x27;s entertainment was lost. If you
are looking for CGI and crazy animation this isn&#x27;t the movie for you or
your children. If you are looking for a movie that won&#x27;t over stimulate
for your kids and is easy enough for them to understand, than this is
the movie to take them.<br /><br />What stands out most about The Muppets is that the movie embraces what
the Muppets were and what their current perception is; and again for
that I applaud them. As you watch the film it is very clear that this
is the message that is the underlying theme of the film. This film is
funny and touching in true Muppet form, all of the characters are
touched upon and the movie flows well with a great deal of cameos. It
is long enough that my 6 year old wasn&#x27;t antsy and my 10 year old
understood it and laughed along without thinking it was a baby movie.<br /><br />I am glad that the Muppets are back and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if
there is another one made soon. To me if you loved the Muppets as a kid
this is a must see. <br /><br />Family Movie Grade: A+<br /><br />Is it Worth the Price of a Rental: Yes<br /><br />Would I watch It Again: Yes<br /><br />please visit our site at www.twodudereview.com
