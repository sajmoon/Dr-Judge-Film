If you haven&#x27;t already that is of course. And while I tried to tell
myself that I didn&#x27;t like the movie, it just is impossible not to like
it (at least for me). It really is sweet and innocent (compared to
other movies trying to reach mature audiences with some weird adult
jokes), but still has a lot going for itself.<br /><br />The success at the Box Office showed that there is an audience for the
Muppets. It also seems that a second movie has been green-lit. It&#x27;d be
great if Jason Segal would again take over the scripting duty (even if
it doesn&#x27;t look like it right now). Even character turns do not feel as
bad as in other movies. Those last minute I&#x27;m gonna change who I am and
be another &#x22;character&#x22; are tricky. Yes those are puppets and yes it&#x27;s
not for everyone. But if you let yourself into this world, you will be
entertained!
