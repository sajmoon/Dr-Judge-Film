It&#x27;s difficult not to get swept up by the hype of the first
theatrically-released Muppet movie in 12 years. The preview trailers
have been going viral since this past summer, and the Muppets &#x26; their
human co-stars have been hitting the talk show circuit like never
before. Audiences who don&#x27;t catch on to this Muppet fever will be
missing a refreshingly entertaining movie.<br /><br />&#x22;The Muppets&#x22; lives up to most of its hype. It&#x27;s a solid, stand-alone
movie with a great storyline. While the film may be considered a
tribute, which in many ways it is, very rarely does a tribute make a
great movie. Any TV show can put the Muppets on proverbial pedestals
using archive footage. &#x22;The Muppets&#x22; succeeds by breathing new life
into characters we&#x27;ve known for years, and bringing them back down from
their high pedestals so they&#x27;re easier to see.<br /><br />It really takes a Muppet fanatic to reintroduce these classic
characters about whom the movie alleges everyone forgot. In the movie,
that fanatic is Walter, who is himself a Muppet that the world treats
like a human being, albeit a very short human being. When Walter
accompanies his best friend and roommate Gary (Jason Segel) and his
longtime girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) to Los Angeles, Walter&#x27;s ultimate
goal is to take a tour of the famed Muppet theater. He soon finds that
the theater&#x27;s glory days are long gone, and the Muppets themselves have
since gone their separate ways.<br /><br />In reality, it&#x27;s Jason Segel who is the Muppet fanatic. Segel co-wrote
the screenplay with Nicholas Stoller (director of &#x22;Forgetting Sarah
Marshall&#x22; (2008)), and also served as executive producer. He does a
good job acting in the movie, knowing precisely when to take a step
back and have the film&#x27;s real stars take center stage. As a
screenwriter, he also allows virtually every classic Muppet to have
their screen time, as the Muppets are brought together the same way
Jake and Elwood reunited the old band in &#x22;The Blues Brothers&#x22; (1980).
Each character&#x27;s appearance reminds us why they were so revered way
back in &#x22;The Muppet Show&#x22; days.<br /><br />The plot involving a Texas oilman wanting to demolish the Muppet
theater because they&#x27;re oil underneath has been done before, but Chris
Cooper, as villain Tex Richman, lives up to his clever name. He&#x27;s funny
while also being a convincing villain. He performs a rap number (yes,
Chris Cooper raps) that is desultory, but amusing if only for its
randomness.<br /><br />If the thought of Cooper rapping alone makes you cringe, there are
plenty of other highly original songs that will wash out that memory
quickly. All the songs, most of which were written by Bret McKenzie
(one half of the band/comedy duo, Flight Of The Conchords), are
well-written. My favorite was &#x22;Man or Muppet&#x22;, sung by Segel and
Walter, which was funny and poignant.<br /><br />&#x22;Pictures In My Head&#x22;, sung by Kermit, is also surprisingly touching,
with Kermit&#x27;s walking through a hallway of Muppet paintings adding to
the sentiment. It could rank as the best Muppet movie song since
&#x22;Together Again&#x22; from &#x22;The Muppets Take Manhattan&#x22; (1984). The
aforementioned songs, and perhaps even &#x22;Life&#x27;s a Happy Song&#x22;, have
strong possibilities to be nominated for Best Original Song at the
upcoming Academy Awards.<br /><br />With all these original tunes, it&#x27;s a wonder why they wasted precious
royalty money on the terrible Starship song &#x22;We Built This City&#x22;. Alas,
this is the chosen song the Muppets sing while renovating the Muppet
theater. <br /><br />While the songs add heart to a movie that makes the term &#x22;franchise
reboot&#x22; seem too myopic, the movie would not be worth watching if it
was not funny. Fortunately, most of the Muppet gags are gut-bustingly
hilarious. Some gags are self-referential with characters breaking the
fourth wall without even have to look at the camera. Others are the
zany gags you&#x27;d expect from seeing &#x22;The Muppet Show&#x22;, but are clever
and hilarious too.<br /><br />While the trailers had their share of recent movie parodies, the film
fortunately eases up on them. There&#x27;s one reference to &#x22;Kill Bill&#x22;, but
it&#x27;s slight and capricious. I also laughed at the 80&#x27;s Robot.<br /><br />All the classic Muppet characters make their mark in ways they haven&#x27;t
done since &#x22;The Muppet Christmas Carol&#x22; (1992), the last great Muppet
movie. The few newer Muppets that are allocated screen time happen to
shine, fortunately. Walter is a great new Muppet, and has a lot of
heart of which the late Jim Henson would whole-heartedly approve.<br /><br />Dozens of celebrity cameos abound here, but the film&#x27;s strength is
knowing who the real stars of the movie are and why we love them. I
just hope younger audience members get the same message.
