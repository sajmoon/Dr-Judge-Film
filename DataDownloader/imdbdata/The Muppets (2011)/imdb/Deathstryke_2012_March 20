I love the Muppets, but this film was a major disappointment, I&#x27;m
actually shocked how they could get it so spectacularly messed up. I
mean they have iconic characters that people love, with a tried and
tested formula that always guarantees hysterical laughter, yet it seems
they&#x27;ve totally abandoned it this time. This didn&#x27;t feel anything like
the Muppets I remember.<br /><br />The knowing wit has been replaced by dumb Hannah Montannah slapstick,
the voice delivery of many of the characters lacks comic timing and the
right tone to give the gags impact. Miss Piggy, for example, sounds
like a bad impersonation of herself.<br /><br />The human characters all act with the sycophantic over-expressiveness
of those horribly gleeful children from &#x22;Barney The Purple Dinosaur&#x22;.<br /><br />Worst of all is the script, co-written by goofball Jason Segal, it&#x27;s no
wonder really. The first hour is just a mish-mash of poorly thought out
&#x22;Boink-boink&#x22; gags, montages, horribly irrelevant song and dance
numbers which, in my opinion, totally neglect the intelligence of
anyone beyond the age of 5. Chris Cooper&#x27;s cringe-inducing rap
segment...Amy Adams&#x27; utterly pointless &#x22;Me Party&#x22; number...Whoopie
Goldberg and Selena Gomez sleep-walking through their tacked on
cameos...it really is face-palm worthy.<br /><br />The last 20 minutes or so is where it starts to pick up. Once the
Muppets begin their telethon show, things veer into more familiar
territory and the gags -including a barber shop quartet to the strains
of &#x22;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#x22;- start to hit the clever absurdist tones
we pay to see. But they all come too little too late.<br /><br />I think I would rather remember The Muppets as they were and pretend
like this awful venture never happened. A wasted opportunity.
