The nineties were not a kind decade for the Muppets. It began with the
death of their creator and mastermind, Jim Henson, followed just two
years later by the passing of another gifted principal Muppeteer,
Richard Hunt. They returned to the big screen in 1992 with a critical
and financial success, the widely frowned-upon &#x22;Muppet Christmas
Carol&#x22;, but after that were bombarded with more unfortunate setbacks.
While their 1996 venture, &#x22;Muppet Treasure Island&#x22; did reasonable
business, it was met with disappointment by critics and fans. A new
television series, &#x22;Muppets Tonight&#x22; was cancelled after just one
half-baked episode. They then came back in 1999 with a new movie,
&#x22;Muppets from Space&#x22;, their first original story in over twenty years -
which unfortunately met with more unfavorable reviews and bombed in
theatres. Finally, Jim Henson company was in financial trouble and
acquired by a German entertainment corporation, which was running into
money problems itself and left the future of the Muppets in question.<br /><br />The Muppets (2011), therefore, came in the middle of this 30-year
semi-slump for the Muppets, and in my opinion, the critics hit the mark
on it. It is a somewhat empty, substanceless adventure that attempts to
run in the same vein as &#x22;Christmas Carol&#x22; but fails to carry with it
the magic. Once again Gozzo and Mrs. Pig are the real stars here, and
that has it&#x27;s downside. They are great supporting characters, but it&#x27;s
Kermit, Fozzie &#x26; Pig that are more suited for the limelight in these
kinds of things. Surprisingly, another Frank Oz character, Sam the
Eagle, becomes a bigger star than Fozzie and Berry Pepper in this film,
but doesn&#x27;t bring his usual humour to the role. Mrs. Pig scares the
bejeezus out of Kermie and gets him to undergo King Solomon&#x27;s Trials,
which are basically pit fights. And another Oz favourite, Gozzo wants
to take over the village with his inhuman ideas about science. Animal,
is virtually absent, muttering two measly lines in the background of
one offscreen scene and is quickly returned to mothballs. <br /><br />Just a note: the Great Muppets Bollywood Extravaganza! is well on its
way! Fun cast, new Muppets, all Bollywood. I super can&#x27;t wait for it to
open. Hee!
