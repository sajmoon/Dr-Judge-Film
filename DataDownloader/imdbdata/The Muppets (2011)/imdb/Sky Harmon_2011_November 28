2011_November 28 
Gave it 7 out of 10 because I&#x27;m a tough critic...but I really enjoyed
this movie! Of course, I was a super-fan of the original series (anyone
else remember Rudolph Nureyev and Miss Piggy dancing Swine Lake?)so,
like many, I was somewhat dreading this new film. Yes, it is very, very
corny, but it is also delightful. The jokes are spot on, the cameos are
priceless, and even the songs were pretty good. The &#x22;Am I a Man or a
Muppet&#x22; song was hilarious. My family and I went the day after
Thanksgiving...ages ranging from 16 to 72. We all enjoyed it. The
audience was diverse as well...all ages, genders and races. Everyone
laughed. The little kids behind me knew the words to &#x22;Rainbow
Connection.&#x22; The 30-ish man sitting in front of my Aunt Mary laughed
himself silly. If the movie has a few slow moments, just go with them.
They don&#x27;t last long and the highs are more than high enough to
compensate. Thanks, &#x22;How I Met Your Mother&#x22; dude whose name I don&#x27;t
know because I don&#x27;t watch that show. Thanks for bringing back the
Muppets.
