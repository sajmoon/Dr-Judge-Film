As Kermit the Frog plays his banjo and sings &#x22;Rainbow Connection&#x22; with
his estranged Miss Piggy, I broke into a big smile. &#x22;The Muppets&#x22;
generates retrospective fond memories for me, also reminding me how old
I am. Unlike me, The Muppets are timeless. Jason Segel, a dedicated fan
of The Muppets, provides irreverent reverence in &#x22;The Muppets&#x22; as
co-writer and human Gary, who helps get &#x22;the band&#x22; back together. Jason
Segel had his signature Muppet moment with the Count Dracula puppet
rock opera in &#x22;Forgetting Sarah Marshall&#x22;. I read a review in
&#x22;Entertainment Weekly&#x22; which brilliantly characterizes &#x22;The Muppets&#x22; as
&#x22;unironic humor&#x22;. &#x22;The Muppets&#x22; is refreshingly unique in its innocent
transparency much like its endearing characters. &#x22;The Muppets&#x22; is just
fun and funny.<br /><br />First off, &#x22;The Muppets&#x22; is a musical&#x97;with puppets integrated with
humans. I really was not expecting the musical part. We get a clue in
the beginning as Jason Segel&#x27;s Gary and his school teacher girl friend
Mary of 10 years, wonderfully played by Amy Adams, who displays her
amazing &#x22;Enchanted&#x22; gifts; suddenly break into song and dance on the
crowded streets of very rural Smalltown, Kansas. Director James Bobin
has a knack at dialing in the musical numbers without a sledgehammer
telegraph. When he doesn&#x27;t it is intentional. His direction has a
distinct charm and follows the natural flow of Segel and Nicholas
Stoller&#x27;s screenplay. Like Segel, we really get Bobin and Stoller&#x27;s
love for &#x22;The Muppets&#x22;. I wonder if The Muppet&#x27;s wide eyed goofiness
overcomes the distinguishing retro charm, and crosses over to a new
generation. That would be nice. Hearing Gary Newman&#x27;s &#x22;Cars&#x22; blaring on
Kermit&#x27;s radio as they assemble The Muppets for one last show is funny
for my generation. At least Segel and Stoller are humorously
self-aware. In one hysterical scene, humorless and spunky Rashida Jones
as network programming exec Veronica says, &#x22;You guys are not relevant
anymore!&#x22; She also illustrates on a pull out chart. Classic.<br /><br />Part of the ridiculous charm of &#x22;The Muppets&#x22; is that people and
Muppets are integrated unquestionably. Gary has a diminutive younger
brother Walter, who looks amazingly like a Muppet, but no one else in
the movie seems to notice. Gary lives with Walter, who is a huge
Muppets fan. The Muppets speak to him. Walter (voiced by amazing Peter
Linz) is gentle and proud in his geek-dom, which is awesome given the
current state of bullying. To celebrate the 10th anniversary of their
relationship, Gary plans a vacation with Mary (Adams) to Los Angeles.
However, Walter is also coming along so they can go on The Muppets
Studio tour. Earnest Gary is clueless to Mary feeling emotionally
threatened by his protective love for his little brother.<br /><br />Much to Walter&#x27;s chagrin, The Muppets Studios is a deteriorated shell
of what it was. Eavesdropping on oil tycoon Tex Richman (hysterically
evil Chris Cooper), Walter discovers the dark conspiracy, and Richman&#x27;s
selfish motives for the property. According to the lease Kermit signed,
unless The Muppets come up with $10 million, the Studio will belong to
Richman. Gary, Mary, and Walter track down Kermit to save the Studio.
The Frog seems to have become a recluse in his mansion, joyless in his
retirement. There is no Piggy, the love of his life. Walter pleads with
Kermit to get the Muppets back together so that they can raise the
money with one last show&#x97;a telethon. Walter convinces Kermit, &#x22;You&#x27;re
my hero&#x85;&#x22; <br /><br />Thus, the journey begins. It is great reuniting with the gang like
Fozzy, Gonzo, Scooter, and Dr. Teeth. I especially loved the Animal
reunion. We find Animal in an Anger Management 12 Step retreat with his
sponsor Jack Black, playing himself. Black is great. Across the
Atlantic Miss Piggy is the Plus-Size Editor of French Vogue in Paris.
Emily Blunt is at her &#x22;The Devil Wears Prada&#x22; best as Piggy&#x27;s hot haute
Assistant. But apparently, Kermit refuses to admit to Piggy that he
specifically needs her, more than just &#x22;they need&#x22;. Will the Muppets
save the Studio? Will Walter discover the greatness within himself?
Will Kermit get off it and be with Piggy? What other celebrities will
drop in for cameos? Remember this is &#x22;The Muppets&#x22;. Things have a way
of working out. It is more than just a trip down memory lane. &#x22;The
Muppets&#x22; is fun and loads of laughs. And yes, we still cheer for them
after all these years.
