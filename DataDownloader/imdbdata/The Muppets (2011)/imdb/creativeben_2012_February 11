&#x22;The Muppets&#x22; manages to offer something to all ages which they can all
enjoy together. This film just gives you such a positivity and an
uplifting feeling because of the amazing characters and the beautiful
connection they all have. The editing was brilliant in the film, in
terms of how they spoofed various editing techniques. For example, to
recruit all the Muppet&#x27;s instead of individually gathering them one of
the characters offers to finish the job by using a montage, also to
travel long distances they keep referring to travelling &#x22;by map&#x22; (like
they do in Indiana Jones etc.) and how they keep saying how they have
had to sing a song about a various situation. It just felt like they
weren&#x27;t taking themselves to seriously and it was light-hearted in
everything they did. The leading characters: Jason Segel, Amy Adams and
new edition Walter did an amazing job at keeping spirits up and giving
really enjoyable performances. Of course, the Muppet&#x27;s themselves have
to be applauded. I loved how they explored Kermits and Miss Piggys
relationship like a proper modern day relationship, it was very very
humorous. I felt like Disney really gave everything to this project, it
was well thought through in how they addressed the Muppet&#x27;s decline in
popularity and how they were going to revive themselves in the public&#x27;s
perception of them. This film wasn&#x27;t a cop out film, a film just to
make money, it felt like this was a story that needed to be told and
that leaves the door open for many new and fresh Muppet&#x27;s adventures.
