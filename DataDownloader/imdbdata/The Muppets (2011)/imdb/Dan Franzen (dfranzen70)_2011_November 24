You&#x27;re gonna laugh a lot, and you&#x27;re gonna cry a little. That&#x27;s the
Muppet formula and has been for four decades. Whether it&#x27;s Fozzie&#x27;s
goshawful jokes or Kermit and Miss Piggy singing &#x22;Rainbow Connection,&#x22;
The Muppets have always known just which heartstrings to pull. This
version - reboot? - manages to combine the sweetness of the original
movie with the chaos and unfettered hilarity of the TV series. It&#x27;s
well cast, and when it&#x27;s all over your cheeks will hurt from laughing
and your eyes will be damp. Yep, it&#x27;s one of those.<br /><br />Are you over 12? Doesn&#x27;t matter. Those of us who grew up on Sesame
Street know all about Muppets, and they&#x27;re as beloved by us now as they
were in the 1970s. Each character a contrasting individual with
eccentricities in full bloom. And all under the control of only a
select few operators!<br /><br />The Muppets follows a fairly common theme in movies - something is
about to be lost (in this case, the old Muppet Theater in which the
original series was filmed), so Something Must Be Done before an evil
someone takes over and does bad things. It&#x27;s not a complex formula,
something like A + B + C. Here, the old &#x22;let&#x27;s put on a show&#x22; trope
gets a genuinely funny - and sincere - workout.<br /><br />To begin with, there&#x27;s a new Muppet, named Walter. In what&#x27;s one of the
funniest unspoken jokes, Walter seemingly has no idea he is a puppet.
After all, he has a human brother named Gary (Jason Segal) and seems
only mildly perturbed when he himself never grows any taller during the
&#x22;early life&#x22; montage. Walter is a huge Muppets fan, and it&#x27;s not tough
to see that one reason this is so is that he sees something of himself
in them, even if he has no idea what that is.<br /><br />Gary, now in his twenties - as is Walter, believe it or not - has a
longtime girlfriend named Mary. Gary plans to take Mary to Los Angeles
(they live in Smalltown, USA) to celebrate ten years together, and as
fate would have it, Walter comes along as well. That&#x27;s when they
discover that the famed Muppet Studios is now a crappy fifty-cent tour
full of dust and decaying memories; Walter surreptitiously learns that
the land is about to become property of one Tex Richman (Chris Cooper)
who tells everyone he plans to build a Muppet museum but who secretly
wishes to destroy all of the property so that he can drill for oil.
This leads Walter, Gary, and Mary to visit Kermit the Frog and convince
him to get the old gang back together so that they can raise enough
money to keep the studio.<br /><br />It&#x27;s a very simple plot, and of course kids aren&#x27;t going to care about
a lack of nuance. In fact, this movie revels in it, mocking such
standards as musical and travel montages (in a couple scenes,
characters travels by map, a la Indiana Jones). There&#x27;s no need for a
complicated plot. All you need is Muppets and a reason for them to be
there.<br /><br />The ingenuity of the very first Muppet movie was in how sweetly it
introduced us to characters we already knew. Kermit&#x27;s travels, picking
up Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf, Electric Mayhem, and Miss Piggy, were a
wonderful road movie full of puns, laughter, and sincerity. This movie
manages to capture quite a bit of that same sentiment. You see, the
movie is set in the real world, and the Muppets have been forgotten -
in real life, they haven&#x27;t made a movie since 1999. So the various
Muppets have scattered. Fozzie, for example, fronts a faux Muppets act
in Reno, Nevada. I am not making that up. Piggy works for Vogue
magazine. Gonzo is a plumbing magnate. True story.<br /><br />The movie nails the sentiment, then. It&#x27;s about many things, and kids
will take many lessons from it (subconsciously, of course). One should
never give up hope on one&#x27;s dreams. One should always look for one&#x27;s
own special talent. One should love one&#x27;s friends and family,
overlooking their weaknesses and giving them strength. One should work
well with others. In essence, that&#x27;s what all the Muppet shows and
series have been about - working together as a team to accomplish
something genuine and beautiful, and this movie really does a terrific
job of making every single character&#x27;s effort seem worthwhile and
necessary. <br /><br />This isn&#x27;t a sappy movie, either. There was actual applause - from kids
as well as adults - in the theater in which I saw this film. It never
drags, even with musical numbers - and even those music numbers are
mocked by the characters themselves (&#x22;didn&#x27;t we just sing this song?&#x22;).
The tone is artfully woven; we laugh, we cry, and we beam because that
is how infused with meaning and sincerity these characters truly are. <br /><br />And oh yes, there are some celebrity cameos, though not really very
many. Only one of them, Alan Arkin, actually appeared on the original
Muppet Show series, interestingly enough; I kept waiting for Steve
Martin or Mel Brooks to show up, but no.<br /><br />And I&#x27;m betting there weren&#x27;t many dry eyes in the audience when,
during the telethon to raise money, Kermit and Miss Piggy duet on
&#x22;Rainbow Connection,&#x22; banjo and all. Adults mouthing the words, kids in
awe. A real treat.
