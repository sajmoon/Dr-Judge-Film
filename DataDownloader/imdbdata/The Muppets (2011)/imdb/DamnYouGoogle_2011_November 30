2011_November 30 
Let me start this review by saying how much of an effect The Muppets
have had on my life (particularly my childhood.). I have honestly have
probably seen every thing Muppet related from every episode of the
original TV show to their more recent direct to DVD attempts, and
through thick and thin I&#x27;ll always be a Muppet fan, but I was
apprehensive going to see this film. After the lukewarm at best Muppets
from Space I don&#x27;t know a single Muppet fan that isn&#x27;t a little iffy
about what the next big Muppet project would be like.<br /><br />2011&#x27;s The Muppets is far from the best Muppet outing of all time but
it does some very clever things to make the film enjoyable. It is
painfully self aware of the age and popularity drop of The Muppets
sometimes to a fault, as expected the jokes of these types are hit and
miss. It also takes 2 ADULT humans and a new Muppet and throws them
into The Muppet universe in a surprisingly effective manner. The
reasons this movie succeeds is the same reason its not perfect and that
is the fact it 1. Doesn&#x27;t take itself serious at all. 2. The main
&#x22;plot&#x22; is literally about 7 different little plots used to set up gags
and bring The Muppets together, and 3. ENDLESS FAN SERVICE.<br /><br />The film begins in the town of Smallville where we meet our main &#x22;not
so much protagonists but main focus of the first 30 minutes of the
film.&#x22; Gary and his puppet brother Walter. Walter being different from
others growing up found comfort in The Muppets and their show and
always dreamed of going to the (im pretty fictional) Muppet studios.
Gary is a likable, up beat, young man that loves his puppet brother
more than anything in the world except maybe his girlfriend Mary and
decides to celebrate his anniversary taking his bother and girlfriend
to LA to fulfill his brothers dream and celebrate his 10th anniversary
with Mary. When the 3 get to LA they see the Muppets lot in ruins and
all but forgotten, and through some coincidence Walter hears of I local
oil tycoons plan on buying and destroying the studio in a funny
sequence where the films writers themselves crack fun at the giant plot
dump of a scene it is. From then on its up to Walter and company to
reunited The Muppets to help raise the 10 million dollars they need to
save their studio (that none of them use anymore so we don&#x27;t really
known why its important to save it we just roll with the punches.) The
2nd and 3rd act are essentially set pieces showing what The Muppets are
up to after their fame has dwindled and The Muppets trying to put on a
great show after years of no practice and little relevance in pop
culture, and its pretty much all fan service, great cameos, solid
jokes, and solid songs follow. I guess my main problem with this is it
makes the original 3 main characters pseudo-plots seem tacked on...and
it seems this way because they are tacked on, also The Muppets internal
conflict with one another in preparing for the show becomes the
antagonizing factor and the &#x22;villain&#x22; jumps on and off screen about as
much as Dr. Claw from the Inspector Gadget cartoon series.<br /><br />I guess a more cynical watcher could say this film is The Muppets
standing around looking at the camera screaming &#x22;WE STILL EXIST!&#x22; and I
guess they would be right but for me this film was just good old
fashion fun with all the trimmings. So, is The Muppets better than The
Muppet Movie or even maybe better than the best Muppet film of all time
A Muppet Christmas Carol...no its also not better than The Great Muppet
Caper, or Muppet Treasure Island in my opinion, but it is something to
work from for a new reboot of the brand and is certainly enjoyable.
Gaps in funny moments, lack of genuine conflict (and lack of Statler
and Waldorf even though they are in the film and have some classic
lines.) and a tangled &#x22;plot&#x22; holds the film back from the adventure it
could&#x27;ve been and has us settle for a self aware reintroduction to some
of my favorite characters of all time and Im okay with that and I feel
lots of other people will feel the same.<br /><br />The Muppets IMDb Rating: 7/10 Star Rating: ***
