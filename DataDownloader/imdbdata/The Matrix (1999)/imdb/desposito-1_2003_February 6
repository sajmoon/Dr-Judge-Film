i really would like to know what philosophy did francis menor find in
the
matrix...
...&quot;what spectacular antagonisms conceal is 'the unity of poverty'.
differing forms of a single alienation contend in the masquerade of the
total freedom of choice by virtue of the fact that they are all founded
on
real repressed contradictions. depending on the needs of the particular
stage of poverty that it is supposed at once  to deny and sustain, the
spectacle may be 'concentrated' or 'diffuse' in form. in either case, it
is
no more than an image of harmony set amidst desolution and dread, at the
still center of misfortune.&quot; (guy debord, the society of the spectacle,
1968)...
...but regarding the matrix...it was a good action movie!
