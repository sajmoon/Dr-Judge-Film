what do you get when you mix a captivating, fateful sci-fi plot, classy
actors and the competent use of state-of-the-art computer fx? high end
entertainment like &quot;star wars&quot;, of course, 25 years ago. or &quot;the time
machine&quot;, more than 40 years back from now. but every generation of
science
fiction produces a new, unrivalled spearhead.<br /><br />this time it's &quot;matrix&quot;, that shook my perception like only &quot;star wars&quot;
did
before. far more mental and gothic than any other major sci-fi production,
matrix brings back faith- and faceless paranoia to a washy, starving
mainstream.<br /><br />cinematic future had almost drowned in a flood of predictable &quot;bash-the
banshee&quot; plots, filled with boring, ray-gun toting steroidtypes, ready to
fight some butt-ugly, hostile &quot;lifeform&quot;. culmination took place in paul
verhoeven's &quot;starship troopers&quot;, which artfully got subsequently
characterized a parody on the genre to avoid unintended
laughter.<br /><br />forget about all that dullhalla, &quot;matrix&quot; rules the brainwaves from now
on.
a fat 10/10.
