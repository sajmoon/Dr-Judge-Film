The Matrix really is a different kind of movie to any other I have ever
seen, thats not to say its the best, but its definitely top ten material.
It
has a great story, very clever and original special effects, good acting,
brilliant soundtrack, all held together perfectly by top drawer
editing.<br /><br />Like most movies that feature special effects prominentley, this was
probably best seen in the cinema, but with a large screen or widescreen
TV,
a decent 5.1 surround sound or DTS and a darkened room, it really does
impress. Nearly every scene/chapter makes great demo material for all the
show-off tech-heads out there!<br /><br />A very strong 9 out of 10!
