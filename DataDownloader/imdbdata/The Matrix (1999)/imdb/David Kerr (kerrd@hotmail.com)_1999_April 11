The Matrix rocks!  It is the best movie I have seen in years.  It is not
perfect, but it is one of those movies, like Braveheart and Titanic, that
put you on the edge of your seat and make you sweat.  Also like Titanic and
Braveheart, The Matrix is not very original (ex. Braveheart is a rip-off of
Spartacus), but what it does, it does well, and doesn't pretend to be smart.
It just is a cool movie!  I've seen it twice and can't wait to get it on
DVD!
