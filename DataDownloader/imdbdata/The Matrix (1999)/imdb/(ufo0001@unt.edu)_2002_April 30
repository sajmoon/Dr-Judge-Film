Pros: Memorable special effects, Characters and Stunts
Cons: Character development lacking, ending, Alice references<br /><br />cyberpunk has a new addition and it is a brilliant new film by the
warchowski brothers. The Matrix owns a kindred spirit to &quot;Dark City&quot; as it
has basically the same premise and cinematography is preety much the same.
Acting is crisp and believable and there are a few corny dialogues. The
stunts are incredible in this movie and so are the amazing special
effects<br /><br />Premise: Morpheus finds the one who will lead all human kind into a battle
with the machines and free us all<br /><br />the matrix was awarded with four academy awards though all in the technical
side<br /><br />Grade: 9/10 (A sci-fi classic)
