A large part of the appeal of 'The Matrix' for me was the special
effects and action-packed scenes. But, on reflection, part of the
appeal is also its philosophical and religious underpinnings...<br /><br />When asked whether Buddhist ideas influenced them, the Wachowski
brothers offered an unqualified &quot;Yes!&quot; and at a very basic level, the
movie portrays two levels of reality: our everyday existence and a
deeper, more significant, underlying reality (the matrix). This is very
much like the Two Truths in Buddhism: relative truth, in which
everything is perception, and ultimate truth which is the way things
really are (objective reality). <br /><br />Because of our ignorance, we mistake the everyday world for something
real and objective, and this is the cause of our suffering. As in 'The
Matrix', breaking through relative truth to direct contact with
ultimate truth represents a high spiritual attainment, some would say
enlightenment, an awakening. (Remember the message on Neo's computer
screen: &quot;Wake up, Neo!&quot;)<br /><br />Mahayana Buddhism suggests that there are great spiritual warriors
(like Neo?) who are walking the path from ignorance to enlightenment,
and who can in turn guide us on the path.
