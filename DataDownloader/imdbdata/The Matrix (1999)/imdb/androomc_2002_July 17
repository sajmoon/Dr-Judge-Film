ok when the matrix first came out i simple loved every minute of it. but
when you think about it, every time a decent movie comes out everybody
loves
it for a week and then it fades.<br /><br />there is no doubt that the matrix is a good movie but i think maybe i
over-hyped it a little too much. now that the excitement has passed i can
probably make a more accurate judgement on the movie.<br /><br />the special effects were groundbreaking and added a whole new dimension to
film and story telling<br /><br />the script was good but not amazing<br /><br />the characters were fairly well developed but not as good as in films like
pulp fiction, however the amount of action in this movie meant there wasnt
really enough screen time for some proper development
p.s. fishbourne was truly excellent<br /><br />the casting was spot on, keanu is the perfect geek, laurence the father
figure and trinity the sexy tom boy rebel<br /><br />all in all a great way to spend 2 hours of your life watching
it
but the excitement fades over time
