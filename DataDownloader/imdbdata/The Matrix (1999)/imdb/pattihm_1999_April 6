1999_April 6 

A GREAT sci-fi action movie.  When I heard a day before it opened that
people were raving about it I knew that was a good sign.  It ranked up
there
with Blade, as an action movie; and surpassed it as far as storyline.  If
you liked blade, bladerunner, etc., you should like this
flick.
