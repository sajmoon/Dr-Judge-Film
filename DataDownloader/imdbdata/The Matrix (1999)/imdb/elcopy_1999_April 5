The Matrix is destined to be a science fiction -if not a cult- classic.
Stunning
special effects, hip storyline, stylish cinematography, and action
sequences
brought directly from Asian Cinema. Everything is perfectly put
together.<br /><br />While there are some small holes in the plot (not surprisingly, in character 
development) they don't diminish the movie at all. Behind it there's a
moral:
You control your own destiny. And that's a plus, putting aside the 
entertainment.<br /><br />A breathtaking experience.
