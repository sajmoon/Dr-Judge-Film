This movie really has it all, and even though that sounds like a bought and
paid for testimonial that some crap movie would shell out for, it's the
real
deal with The Matrix.<br /><br />It looks good: The Wachowski brothers continue their beautiful work (after
Bound) to give The Matrix a visual richness that most directors today seem
to ignore. Great angles that let you actually see what's happening, moody
sets that really create an atmosphere even before anything is said, and
well
placed and utilized special effects that don't take over the theme are all
examples of where these guys are coming from. I think they call it &quot;vision&quot;
in directors. Whatever it is, the Wachowskis have it, and they don't just
make movies, they craft them.<br /><br />The characters are solid: Sure, hack on Keanu all you want, but he fits the
role of Neo to a tee, and I can't think of anyone who would have been more
convincing. (As convincing, sure, but no one moreso.) Fishburne,
Pantoliano,
Moss, and Weaving are subtley brilliant, playing up their characters
without
going over the top. There is not a wasted word of dialogue, and it is all
delivered in just the right way. Delicious!<br /><br />The Plot is as cool as Terminator, but with more philosophy: The Matrix
actually makes you think, and while that is good in any movie, it is even
more golden in an action-driven movie like this. Not only do we have to
question the age old dilemma about what makes us exist (We are if we think
we are? Would it be better to be a happy brain in a vat or a miserable
person?), but we also get to play with the entire meaning of the Matrix
itself. Personally, I think The Matrix is actually the mass
media/materialistic society itself that has blinded us into being mere
consumers. My metaphor has Neo discovering that the real world needs him to
be more than some working stiff cog in the machine--it needs him to break
out of the consumerist cloud we all walk in to become a modern day
revolutionary. But that's just me. The movie works no matter what you read
into it.<br /><br />Finally, the special effects are special: I don't usually put much stock
into effects. A movie that hypes tricks isn't usually much of a movie. The
Matrix, however, really uses the effects to propel the plot and give the
atmosphere some credibility. In other words, I don't think the movie was
conceived to showcase some breakthrough techniques in cinematography, I
think the story was there and they needed some good visuals to help tell it
properly. There's a big difference.<br /><br />When all is said and done, The Matrix is one of those movies that I can
watch over and over again without getting bored, it is just so well done. I
give it a perfect 10 without hesitation--I can't ask for anything
more.
