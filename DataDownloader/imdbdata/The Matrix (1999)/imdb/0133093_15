In the year 1999, &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;Fight Club&quot; were undoubtedly the
best films of the year. The Matrix was truly revolutionary in special
effects, specifically in CGI (Computer-Generated-Imaging) technology.
The still cameras that were used to capture multiple angles of a single
shot, in bullet-time technology, was a creative new approach. The film
is initially suspenseful with people not knowing quite what was
happening until Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) reveals that Neo's (Keanu
Reeves) reality was actually a fabricated world that is an elaborate
simulation created by machines. Neo and the majority of the world's
inhabitants have been stuck in simply a mental simulation prison. <br /><br />The magnitude of philosophy in sync with special effects make &quot;The
Matrix&quot; a one-of-a-kind movie masterpiece. College classes show this
movie in their philosophy class, and at the same time can prove to be
one of the best special effects movies ever. Supplementally, &quot;The
Matrix&quot; also provides endless action and a pretty solid storyline that
influences the philosophical ideas in the movie. <br /><br />There are so many great things in this movie, it is just crazy.<br /><br />The color palette along with the time and effort put into stunts also
accelerates this movie on all filming levels. &quot;The Matrix&quot; leaves the
viewer a sense of pride in the world he/she can live in to just know
that people are capable of creating at this level. Unfortunately,
monetary and timing motives offset the potential quality of the
sequels. &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; were just a
waste of time and weren't carefully thought out, as was the first
Matrix. <br /><br />10/10
