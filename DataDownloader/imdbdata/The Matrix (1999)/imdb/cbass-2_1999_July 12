1999_July 12 

This movie was by no means perfect.  The plot was not spectacular and the
acting was by no means top-notch.  It is nothing like &quot;Dark City,&quot; the
best
movie made in the 90s (in my opinion at least) which has, as Roger Ebert
says, &quot;no bad scenes.&quot;  Howard Hawks, the famous director who did Rio
Bravo
among other classics, once said when asked what makes a good film, &quot;3 good
scenes and no bad scenes.&quot;  &quot;Dark City&quot; is a film which accomplishes this,
there are no scenes which do not advance the plot, and yet we still see
some
incredible effects.<br /><br />Anyhow, back to &quot;The Matrix.&quot;  There are plenty of scenes that are not
necessary, one example being the fight scene at the metal detectors near
the
end of the film, but you know what, I don't care.  This movie was visually
incredible.  I was not excited and pumped up after seeing it, I was tired,
and not because it was a boring film.  It is simply that the film wears
out
one's eyes, there is so much movement, so much eye-candy, and so much
brightness.  This movie won't win an Oscar, at least not the big ones, and
it shouldn't.  But it is still an extremely enjoyable and entertaining
film
and except for the cheesy love part at the end, could not have been done
much better.<br /><br />The brothers who directed &quot;The Matrix&quot; succeeded in creating a film that
is
what it tries to be: a visually stunning action film.
