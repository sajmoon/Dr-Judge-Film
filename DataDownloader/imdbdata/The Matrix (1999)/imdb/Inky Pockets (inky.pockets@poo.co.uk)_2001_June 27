During my first viewing of The Matrix, I believed that this was quite
possibly the best film ever made. Maybe it was the cool evening air
against
my tired head, or the hard ground beneath my sore bottom, but in
retrospect
I was almost definitely wrong. It is however a really great sci-fi action
film.<br /><br />The story revolves around one Thomas Anderson (Reeves), or Neo if for some
strange you prefer, and for some strange reason he does. He is introduced
to
fellow ridiculous name barer Morpheus (Fishburne) by the attractive
Trinity
(Moss). Oodles of special effects and numerous fight scenes later, Neo has
pretty much saved the world.<br /><br />The acting is fair, with the film's best performance coming from Hugo
Weaving as the evil Agent Smith. Everyone is excellent in the fight
scenes.<br /><br />The movie is visually astounding. The special effects aren't there just
for
the sake of special effects, and it is the imagery that they create which
makes the film stand out among its rivals. See for example the scene of
the
matrix as it is in reality, with Neo wired up as a battery.<br /><br />To get the full-effect of the film, personally I'd advise watching, as I
did, on a small projection screen in a tent with lots of people chairing
for
Carre-Anne Moss and advising Neo `Take the red pill', `No, take the blue
pill', `Take both'.<br /><br />9/10
