I walked into The Matrix expecting a big disappointment. What I got was a
sweet surprise. I had no idea how visually dazzling and entertaining this
movie was. Aside from the fact that the dialogue (excuse my language)
SUCKED, the music was exciting and the acting decent. It tells the story of
a post-apocalyptic world where the true identity of the world has been
disguised by a computer simulation known as the &quot;Matrix&quot;. There are agents
stuck in this world who need specific codes to escape. The one who has the
codes is Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). He is a computer genius who insists
the help of Neo (Keanu Reeves) a cybernetic fanatic. With this, these two
and their team of warriors must destroy the agents before they can escape
this world.
The Matrix was an entertaining wild-ride that will grip from start to
finish. I recommend to anyone who enjoys science-fiction. <br /><br />*** 1/2 out of *****
