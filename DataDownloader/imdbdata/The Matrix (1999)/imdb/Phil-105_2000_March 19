<br /><br />     I have never seen a movie quite like this.The plot is so seemlessly
interwoven to itself.What is the matrix?You must see for yourself.Neo is the
man of mystery in the movie.He learns that he must destroy the matrix and it
lies.I think some people are confused by the plot.It is confusing.No one
knows how or why the AI took over.I love the Effects and Sound.Lawerence
plays the part better than any man alive can.The matrix is REFRESHING.Its
not SW,Star Trek,Aliens,ETC.It is a stand alone world.Hollywood take heed
from this movie.Further,Agent Smith steals every minute he is on.THE classic
goverment spook plays to perfection.I can't wait to have a dvd player.In
summary,The matrix now has a following similar to SW.I never get tired of
watching it.Sw is the same thing for me.WO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
