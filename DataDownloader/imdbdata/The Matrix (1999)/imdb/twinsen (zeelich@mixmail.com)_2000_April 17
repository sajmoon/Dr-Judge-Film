The Matrix is a good movie, I'm not going to say it's awful. But come on,
it's so typical... The story is good, indeed, it has a good beginning,
with
all the virtual reality things and so, but there's a point in the movie
when
the script disappears forever. Then the fx conquer the movie and they
don't
stop. I like fx, they are great in some movies than doesn't have anything
like a script, but this movie had one, til the fx appeared. Compare this
movie with one I like too much, 12 monkeys. 12 monkeys has a beginning, a
script all over the movie and an end. Matrix has only the beginning. So,
what disappointed me about this movie is that it was said to be a paranoic
movie of virtual reality, and it's finally one more in the fx
movies.
I'm waiting for the other two titles, matrix 2 and 3, but I only hope they
will be the same stuff.
