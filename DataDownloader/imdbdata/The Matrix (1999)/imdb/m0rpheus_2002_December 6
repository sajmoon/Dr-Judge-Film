The Matrix rocks. This is because it explores many of the most important
philosophical conundrums explored by philosophers since ancient times, AND
provides a powerful allegory exploring the importance of mythology in
society and its direct relevance to our own time and place.<br /><br />What is the matrix? According to the dictionary,<br /><br />matrix: 1. A situation or surrounding substance within which something
else
originates, develops, or is contained<br /><br />The Matrix as described in the movie is the set of beliefs, often little
more than myths, that comprises the surrounding substance that contains
and
sets boundaries on human thought. Examples abound throughout history.
There
was the Matrix of the catholic church during the middle ages, based on the
Jesus myth. It is clear that during the middle ages that the church was
far
less about God than it was about power, specifically the power of those
who
&quot;took care of things&quot; for God. The upper echelons of the church hierarchy
were responsible for setting the conditions in the Matrix and used this to
maintain control over society. If the average person in those days were to
be shown that, for example, the Shroud of Turin were a fake, and that no
evidence for God existed, they might suffer the same reaction as when Neo
was unplugged. If they then tried to tell their fellows, they would be met
with disbelief and labeled a heretic! Another example is the Babylonians,
whose society probably constituted the first Matrix, and is referenced in
the movie (the ship is named Nebuchadnezzar, a Babylonian king). Here they
had a priesthood and a pantheon of Gods that justified their hierarchical
society, and provided a false narrative for politics that was used to set
boundaries on the citizens' thinking and maintain control.<br /><br />Although very general in scope, the Matrix specifically chooses our own
society to depict in the movie. The movie thus asks, what is OUR
mythology?
What are the unexamined assumptions that constrain our thinking? This is
the
enduring importance of the Matrix, which I believe elevates to the level
of
the most sublime art.
