2003_February 20 

Firstly, I don't particuarly like Sci-fi movies, there have been some good
ones, but its not one of my favourite genres.  Still I think that the most
important and innovative movie of the last 5 years was The Matrix.  Cinema
has been around for over 100 years.  In my opinion the most important
events
throughout its history have be; the introduction of sound in the late 20s,
technicolour in the early 30s, relaxed censorship laws (more sex &amp;
voilence)
in the 60s, 70s, 80s  onwards.  I think that in the 90s and now,
technology
is the new phenomenon.  There have been a lot of shabby special effects
movies made over the past number of years.  Each trying to be bigger than
the previous.  The  Matrix is the best special effects fuelled movies ever
made.  It has turned special effects into an art form.  Its a progression,
cinema has to go somewhere, it has to move forward.  Making movies with
querky characters, interesting storylines, witty dialogue, its all been
done
before, and its great.  But surely we should be looking to do somthing
cmpletely different.  I'm not saying special effects is the answer, but
somthing, anything - Don't make me whatch the same movies over and over
again evertime I go to the cinema.
