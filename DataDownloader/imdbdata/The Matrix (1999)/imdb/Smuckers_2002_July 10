Computer nerd finds secret to the universe, gets buff, gets guns, gets
violent, gets babe in bondage leather.  The producers of this movie really
knew the demographic they were aiming for.<br /><br />This was a boring, brutal, assaultive movie--shameless in its manipulation
of the audience.  The violence done to Neo's body (the mechanical spider
thing in his intestines, the socket in the back of his head), and then the
violence he commits against others in the movie, were extremely unsettling. 
There was a clever idea at the core of this movie, but after being pummeled
over the head by the various &quot;special&quot; effects, I couldn't have cared less
whether or not Neo saved the world.  I just wanted to get out of the
theater, and into the fresh air and sunlight.<br /><br />Avoid this--unless you enjoy nightmares.
