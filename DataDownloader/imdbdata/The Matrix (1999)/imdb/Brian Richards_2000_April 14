2000_April 14 

I watched this on HBO the other night on the recommendation of a couple of
colleagues from work, and I had high hopes for an intelligent sci-fi treat.
What I found, instead, was the usual mediocre acting and &quot;look-at-me&quot;
special fx one finds in every other Hollywood &quot;blockbuster&quot;. Nowhere near
as
good as it's reputation would have you believe (unless you're as gullible
as
everybody else who got sucked in by this one). Started out on a promising
note, but it was all downhill from there. Keanu is lucky this did so well
at
the box-office. If it had tanked, the rest of his career would likely have
been spent in direct-to-video &quot;b&quot; movie action extravaganzas. Scary
thought,
huh, Keanu? Whoah.
