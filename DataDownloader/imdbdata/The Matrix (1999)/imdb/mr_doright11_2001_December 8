This is one of my favorite movies. It is the most intelligent action movie
I've ever seen. It's one of those movies that are just fun to watch, because
even if you don't get it (I didn't the first time I saw it), you can still
enjoy the massive action scenes, the great visual effects, and the amazing
choreography of the fight scenes.
 
I also really liked the acting. This is the first Keanu Reeves movie in
which I could take him seriously and not see him as the time traveling
valley dude Ted (I thought the Bill and Ted movies were very funny though).
He is convincing, and he is a likable character, so that makes it all the
more enjoyable to watch him undergo the many secrets of the
Matrix.<br /><br />Carrie-Anne Moss was also very cool and sexy as Trinity. She has a good deal
of talent and I hope type casting doesn't end her career like so many other
Sci-Fi movie actors (i.e. Mark Hammel and Roy Schieder). And of course, who
could forget the great Laurence Fishburne, who made Morpheus such a cool
character. I really think that only Laurence Fishburne could have done such
a good job of doing Morpheus. <br /><br />I think this movie is for pretty much everyone. The only people I think that
wouldn't like this movie are people that can't handle even a little
violence, or are upset at the idea of a bleak future (which is probably
where the earth is headed anyway, more or less). It's just a kick ass movie.
Check it out. 10/10
