Finally, someone had the nerve to do a sci-fi film which actually had a
great storyline. The storyline of The Matrix is certainly one of the most
original in a long time for any genre, and the actors do a great job.
Especially Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving are excellent, but also
Keanu
Reeves, who has had a tendency to look ridicolous in any serious movie,
has
a great performance. The Wachowski brothers have created a film that, even
though the visual effects are mind-boggling, first of all is concerned
about
its storyline. And what a brilliant story it is!
