1999_December 2 

Keanu Reeves is one of two people,either a model who can remember
lines,(despite being unable to speak them convincingly)cast merely for
decoration,nothing more than a pretty trained android,interested more in
touring with his thrash-band than being a serious actor.OR.One of the
finest
actors of the decade,merely unfortunate in his continued casting in roles
that seem to be himself,thinly veiled,a Woody Allen for the youngsters.The
Matrix sees Reeves emerge from the fargo of his last two efforts(Chain
Reaction and The Devils Advocate)relatively unscathed,with his lead role
in
the Wachowskis sophomore effort,this ingenious piece,that is,in its
simplest
form,an entertaining slice of sci-fi,full of big explosions,big
fights,girls(and guys)in leather and revolutionary camera techniques.Probe
beneath the surface though,and The Matrix becomes a deeply philosophical
film exploring the nature of reality.That the entire world has been
constructed to shelter us from the real world,a black,horrific nightmare
of
an existence(if thats what it can be called)is a high concept,and without
the sagely Morpheus alongside to guide us through the confusing first 45
minutes,the plot machinations would surely become too heavy for all but
the
most astute of filmgoers.Yes,the big explosions(helicopters smashing into
skyscrapers)big gun fights and gymnastic fisticuffs are all present and
correct,but The Matrix is so much more than that,more than just another
shoot-em-up movie.The Wachowskis obviously wanted cool to be of the
essence,with virtually the entire cast sporting shades for the whole
film(kinda like John Belushi in The Blues Brothers)and with Keanu Reeves
on
hand to provide the lust aspect(for the ladies)and the not entirely
repulsive Carrie-Ann Moss for the guys to ogle,it works very well.The
acting
is top-notch,but is really inconsequential to the slo-mo karate in
Laurence
Fishburnes virtual reality dojo,and the climactic shoot out in the hotel
lobby.The Matrix is a high concept piece of movie-making,but one that
succeeds,in true action style.As Keanu so eloquently puts it:Woah!
