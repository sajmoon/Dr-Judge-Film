Shakespeare it ain't, but if you're a fan of the Die Hard or Terminator
series, you'll love this movie. The special effects are outstanding, and
worthy of Oscar note, the acting is solid, and the storyline is credible.
For those moviegoers who have ever pondered the question of what =is= real,
this film's dysutopian look at what is to come will provide food for
thought. My computer is continuously online, as are millions of others
around the planet. Can it be long before =something= wakes
up?
