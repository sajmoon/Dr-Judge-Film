1999_May 19 

I generally don't like sci-fi movies about computers and/or
VR. There are always exceptions, but unfortunately there's nothing
exceptional about this film. The villains are bland and
non-intimidating, Keanu Reeves is a terrible lead and
the matrix itself along with the characters inside of it just aren't
interesting. the influence of Hong Kong cinema as well
as
MORTAL KOMBAT is evident in the action scenes. I still look forward to
future offerings from the Wachowski Brothers because I liked ASSASSINS and
BOUND, but I doubt I would watch any sequels to this.
