1999_November 17 

I am here to express to you my obsession with The Matrix.  It is, by far, my
favorite movie.  Morpheus was a great leader, Cypher made a great traitor,
Neo was, well..Neo for some reason reminded me of a California surfer-dude,
go figure.  I'm just playin, even Keanu did a great job as the superhero.  A
few things I didn't quite understand, like how Agents, even though the
Matrix was created by the AI, don't have omnipotence in this environment.
Why did they design themselves to have to abide by the rules of their
environment?  But, no matter, still an excellent film, with stunning visual
effects, great soundtrack, original plot, and a pretty damn good cast.
Three thumbs up.  (why not?)<br /><br />
