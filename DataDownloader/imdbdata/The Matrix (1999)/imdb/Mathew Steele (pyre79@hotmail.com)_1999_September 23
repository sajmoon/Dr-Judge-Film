1999_September 23 

Rarely have I seen such an incredible movie.  Some say that Keanu Reeves
is
somewhat wooden in The Matrix, but I can't think of anyone who could play
the role better.  It has a great plot that keeps you ensnared until the
end,
when you're begging for it to keep going.  You leave wishing it were real.
The effects were, in a word, perfect.  I have to say that there are only
one
or two flaws in the entire movie, and I'm not telling what they are,
because
I wish I didn't know them.  But then, you have to see it as many times as
I
have to notice.  If you haven't seen this movie, rent it.  I promise it
will
blow you away.  It has The Phantom Menace beat hands down, if you ask me.
