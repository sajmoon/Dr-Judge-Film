1999_May 17 

The amazement on everyone's face... the future retro world, if it exists,
set into play by the fuzzy logic of the king computer.  It's all hard to
swallow for some, but I enjoyed the ride thru this amazing landscape.  It
was a surreal experience to be sure, but the technical expansion of
special
effects into this landscape of &quot;unreality&quot; makes it believable.  The
concept
isn't that far off the mark from any time travel adventure or fairy tale.
Sit back and enjoy this film for it's fresh look at the good guys vs. the
bad and reel-in the sonic and visual stimulation of the many effects
sequences.  It's going to have precedence in the many copy-cat films to
follow, using these highly original techniques for presentation of
landscape, the fights and flights of our heroines.  See this film soon and
pay attention to the faces... as you leave the theater!
