Let your brain (if you have one) relax and take a leave of absence for a
couple of hours. If you found the plot to be mentally enjoyable or, even
worse, challenging than you are pretty much dumb.<br /><br />The effects are of course great as &quot;The Matrix&quot; is just another Hollywood
HUGE budget movie. However, the plot is designed for the mentally
challenged. One example: when Keanu Reeves supposedly attains supreme level
of comprehension/integration/whatever with the matrix, everything seems to
be mapped with an animated texture with symbols scrolling accross. It
either
goes all away or it stays exactly the same. Completely idiotic. Or in a
series of 1-2-5-10-100 symbols the knowledgeable can distinguish a good
looking blonde or an agent chasing the team in an alley, or whatever. Grow
up!<br /><br />If the scene when the old hag predicts the breaking of the glass before it
happens made you think (probably for only a couple of seconds, until the
next action sequence) about the limits of prescience, the essence of time,
or the concept of self-determination and at the end you felt you have
gained
a valuable insight, I feel bad for you. This is just supperficial crap for
the modern man/woman/teenager who is just too damn busy to think. Read a
book. A real book. And THINK people, don't use scenes from &quot;The Matrix&quot; as
examples in your rare philosophical conversations. Its a sure sign of what
kind of a person you are.<br /><br />I can understand enjoying the action. That is the reason why I watched it.
But I was fully aware at all times of its fundamental flaws. I recommend
you
do the same.
