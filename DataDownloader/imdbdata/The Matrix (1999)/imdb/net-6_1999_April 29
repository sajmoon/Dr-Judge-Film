Finally, here is a movie that doesn't take for granted the intelligence of
the audience.  &quot;The Matrix&quot; is not only a pulse-pounding sci-fi action film
but it is also one that stimulates the mind.  With ingenious plot,
multi-dimensional characters, as well as intense symbolism and
socio-philosophy the movie not only keeps you on the edge of disbelief but
it also rocks your mind and soul.  12 out of 10.  Let's see if the Phantom
Menace can top this.
