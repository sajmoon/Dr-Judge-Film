1999_August 26 

I must admit that Matrix is very amazing as a show of pure images. A lot of
fx make this movie really impressive. But the basic idea (what you see is
not true) is not so new. Even the idea of a bunch of freedom-seeking hackers
has been often used in cyberpunk literature. The biggest limit of Matrix is
the lack of courage: whenever the directors are about to cross the line of a
scifi movie to enter the world of big cinema, they choose the easier way
(gunfights, a bit of Bruce Lee 20 years after).
And one last thing, the guy resurrected by the princess' kiss: so
miserable...
They tried to turn an average story into a new Blade Runner, but I'm afraid
it turned out as a Luxury edition of Johnny Mnemonic.
Rated 7 (to me) but Matrix does not go beyond the limit of a genre
movie.
