2001_August 8 

When I first saw this film the week it was released, I thought it was more
entertaining than most, and I felt my admission price was
justified.<br /><br />Then a few weeks later, I went and saw it in the theatre again, because a
friend hadn't seen it. The second time around had to be one of the least
pleasant moviegoing experiences I have had. During the second viewing, the
movie seemed to drag on and on, and I had a strong desire to be elsewhere.<br /><br />As I try to think about why this occurred, I believe it was because the
movie was propelled by action scenes and suspense, but little else. Once
you
know what will happen, and have seen those scenes before, the movie becomes
boring. Quite often I do like watching movies repeatedly, often into the
double digits with the movies I own. But those movies have a
rewatchability
that the Matrix lacks.<br /><br />I believe fellow members of my generation are enamoured by this movie
because of how it portrays the hyper-cool existence. By this I mean an
existence where even the slightest things are portrayed with a profound
mysticism and awesome beauty; a slick, hyper-mtv universe. This may result
from a feeling of dull clumsiness and utter unsignificance present amongst
many of today's under 30 set.<br /><br />Then there are those that say &quot;oh, this movie is deep, because it has
'philosophy'&quot;. Maybe so, but it is philosophy of the absolute worst kind!
For more on this, look to Nietzche's &quot;Twilight of the Idols&quot; and &quot;The
Anti-Christ&quot;. This movie has the most contemptible philosophy since
&quot;Bicentennial Man&quot;.<br /><br />As a final statement, I will say this. The Matrix is entertaining for its
unusual premise and interesting action, however once you get over these and
find out what happens, it loses all flavour like old chewing
gum.
