1999_November 7 

yeah! I'm finally registered! Anyway, now that I am, I just wanted to say
that buying that large-screen TV was worth it when I saw The Matrix at
home... Oh! Great! Oh, and if you're like me, and in a Philosophy class,
all
the allusions doubly stick out! And if you're not, Keanu Reeves is worth
watching =)So, as they say, have fun just following the white rabbit down
the rabbit hole!!!
