1999_June 17 

Having read many positive reviews of &quot;The Matrix&quot;, all of them intelligent
and succinctly written, I feel that I am finally able to put my own feeble
thoughts into words.<br /><br />First off I should say that I absolutely LOVED this movie!  I've seen &quot;The
Matrix&quot; four times and still can't get enough of it.  Going in the first
time with little expectations of a plot, I was pleasantly surprised to
find
a compelling and thought-provoking story.  Initially, I chalked up my
enjoyment to the fact that I got a little more than I'd expected, and had
been temporarily overwhelmed.  Upon second viewing, however, I was struck
by
it even more.  It seemed so plausible because everything 'fit' so well.
The
story, the mood, the actors, the dialogue.  It just grabbed me as a whole.
Made me want to be there.  To believe it.  To experience it for myself.
And
I realized, any movie I've ever really loved, I've never been able to say
why in any coherent fashion.  &quot;The Matrix&quot; left me speechless.  It just
blew
me away.<br /><br />One specific thing I'd like to comment on, which only occurred to me after
viewing number four, seems strange even to myself.  The main characters,
for
all their Kung-Fu training and gun-wielding antics, seemed hauntingly, and
somehow appropriately, gentle.  As if they were compensating for, through
their interactions with each other, the violence they had to endure - and
even perpetrate - elsewhere.  The juxtaposition of human emotion and
technological horror during the final climax was especially poignant.
Although I'd be inclined to give the lion's share of the credit for this
to
the actors, the Wachowski Brothers provided them with stunning material to
work with and through.<br /><br />Just another of the many twists to ponder in &quot;The Matrix&quot;.  So go see it a
few times.  It's well worth the $8.75 several times over.
