2003_January 20 

At first I loved this film, but now, after half a dozen viewings realise I
was suckered by the effects. The acting is poor and Keanu is totally
unconvincing in his macho martial arts pose which causes him to look like
a
complete prat in one of the films unintentionally funniest moments. The
story has too many religious undertones for my comfort and lacks
plausibility.
However a spectacular and moody film which in the right circumstances is
highly entertaining and watchable.
I would suggest as more worthy alternatives Blade Runner or Twelve
Monkeys.
