1999_November 2 

Well there's been some mixed reactions to this film, with most reviewers
conceding it an excellent special effects film, a popular film, but lacking
substance and a coherent narrative. Yet The Matrix is a particularly
important and seminal film, for our generation and especially the aspiring
filmmakers and critics of Australia.<br /><br />There are some reasons why The Matrix has not been celebrated amongst the
informed film-going elite. Most of the tenured film critics are not in the
target market for this film. Have they read William Gibson or Bruce
Sterling? Are they excited by the use of electronic music? Are they young
enough to get off on the film's kinetic energy and film quotations? I don't
think so. They may have a good time with it, but it strikes them as too
contrived, too derivative, too science-fiction and too much concept. Yet it
is exactly the concept that makes it art. The Matrix is going to be one of
the film-texts of our time, a cultural signpost of lasting influence and
importance, yet reviewers have shown great reluctance to describe it as
anything other than eye-candy - a spectacle-driven commercial
prospect.<br /><br />although you try to discredit
ya still never edit
the needle, i'll thread it
radically poetic<br /><br />Senior critics writing for traditional media have noted that certain scenes
are similar to computer games and comic books, but none of them have noted
the irony of using Rage Against the Machine's &quot;Wake Up&quot; to end the film. I
suspect the established culture-vultures do not own Rage Against the
Machine's anarchic 1992 album, and subsequently are not sensitive to the
generational injokes of this movie and the electronic soundtrack which
excites us as we wait in the wings. I doubt these professional writers own
Playstations or have ever played Syndicate on a PC, and I doubt many of
them
will ever come across this review because they do not frequent the net
except to send emails. It seems to me that few in the art establishment
have
a realistic view of where all this technology is taking us. Few outside the
IT industry have prophesised film and television converging with the
interactive game and communal web experience. Yet talk to anyone under 25
and they is little doubt that soon we'll be kissing passive, linear
lightshows goodbye as we plug into our boxes. How long? Not long, because
what you reap is what you sow. The Matrix, along with Cronenberg's upcoming
Existenz, Bigelow's Strange Days, and the tv miniseries Wild Palms are the
precursors to this paradigm shift.
Produced by Oliver Stone, Wild Palms had a cameo by William Gibson.
Significantly, The Matrix lacks such an acknowledgement, which far from
being a point of a criticism, is actually an inditement of the extent to
which these ideas have been taken up by our generation, that distopian
cyberpunk is a genre we are already familiar with whether we have read the
books or not. We don't need to see William Gibson to know the filmmakers
love the man and the genre he helped create, because these ideas are now
taken for granted - to label them 'cyberpunk', 'postmodern' or
'Gibsonesque'
is to state the b******* obvious.<br /><br />In addition to c-punk, video games and comic books, the Wachowski's have
gleefully incorporated a potpourri of film references, such as the
Peckinpah
inspired gatling scene, the Bruce Lee/Kung Fu signature shots and John
Woo/Chow Yun Fat gunfights (choreographed by Hong Kong legend Yuen Woo
Ping), the flight deck of the Millenium Falcon in the asteroid, the organic
technology of Plasm (by Defiant comics), industrial terrain and
micro-robots
of City of Lost Children, the smashed sunglasses and invulnerable nature of
the AI quoting Terminator 2 and many more.<br /><br />In Projections 8, Peter Cowie, publishing director for Variety, laments
that
young people leaving film school today would much rather aspire to &quot;Men in
Black, the Usual Suspects or Seven than the cerebral cinema of Kieslowski,
Bergman or Fassbinder.&quot; God forbid! The gulf between 'us' and 'them' is
particularly evident in our celebration of The Matrix and the contrast it
provides to their corrupt visions of the future as presented in the Fifth
Element, Men in Black and the deplorable ID4. Like Southpark, Beavis and
Butthead and hip-hop, most adults just don't get it ... and who can be
bothered explaining it to them? The Matrix draws together disparate
influences, demographic-specific quotations and references and attains a
historical and social relevance greater than they realise. So be it. Just
as
Parker Lewis Can't Lose, time will show that these movies signify a new
wave
of filmmaking as exuberant and inspiring as any other - people will forget
that they were once derided as rollercoaster rides, soulless FX, a
cheapened
artform.<br /><br />And while there is product placement by Nokia, Fed Ex and various banks,
the
film hardly belongs to the league of big blockbusters that threaten
national
and boutique cinemas with their titanic marketing budgets and cross-over
appeal. Shot in Sydney with a B-cast already says something about the
budget
constraints, as does the simple locations and unsophisticated furnishings
eg. the city phone books, the 'marble' in the lobby shootout which wobbles
like polypropylene when the girl headbutts a sheet whilst taking cover.
Seeing Sydney on the screen was both gratifying and enervating. Constantly
distracted by trying to locate the streets and buildings they had used, I
was simultaneously riled that several locations I frequent have now been
appropriated by Americans with the money with the tech - wynyard station
alleyway, eddy ave central, anzac bridge. At least Alex Proyas (the Crow,
Dark City) is Australian. These guys from Fox are stealing our landmarks
and
recasting them as American, populating this captured landscape with
imported
american cars, cops and payphones. The film co-opts Sydney as exotic
scenery
for America's consensual hallucination, reconstructing our territory as a
virtual space, a matrix in itself. There were some shots taken of Martin
Place, looking down from the MLC building, which was amusing if you knew
that's where the American Consulate is located. Visiting filmmakers and
studio bigwigs are often invited over for lunch in that boardroom with its
amazing views.<br /><br />Am I wrong to be irritated by our virtual colonisation? I don't know what
the rules are on making films in Australia, but there seems to be some
quota
on usage of local talent. Hugo Weaving was astounding as a menacing AI
agent, adopting this incredibly sharp articulation of words that suited his
role as an imitation human, but he obviously had American accent written
into his casting contract. The only Australian accent in the film belongs
to
one of the Oracle's potentials - a nice little piece of Orientalism in a
half-pint white Aussie kid sitting in lotus position with a shaved head and
kimono, spouting mystic easternisms like &quot;Do not think of bending the
spoon,
but know that there is no spoon.&quot; Whatever happened to &quot;my dad picks the
fruit...&quot;? I guess Cottees couldn't afford the product
placement.
