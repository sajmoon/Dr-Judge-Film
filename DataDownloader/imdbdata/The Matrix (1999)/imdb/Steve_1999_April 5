1999_April 5 

The Matrix is probably the best movie experience I have seen in a long time.
This movie amazed me and, really held my attention well. The plot is very
good and unique, which really says a lot about the brothers that wrote and
directed the movie.<br /><br />As I already said I was blown away. Even though it is marketed as a sci-fi
film it really appeals to all genres. It had great action, including one
incredible scene where Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne fight, comedy,
science-fiction, and very little drama. This well rounded film keeps you
asking for more after you leave the theater.<br /><br />To speak for the technology of this film, I think a good word to describe it
is revolutionary. In no other film will you see the massive computer and
camera effects. All of the fight scenes were very well put together to give
you a very good feel for what the actors were doing every move, instead of
jerking you around and leaving you clueless. Nothing can describe the
amazing computer graphics. It just blows away every other movie out
now.<br /><br />The plot is completely unique and is not too sci-fi to lose its reality.
The actors really make the movie. They are great in showing the action, and
making you know what is going on.<br /><br />Finally, I would like to say that I was so impressed that I went to see it
three times after I saw it the first. Everything combined makes this a truly
great movie that I would see over and over again.<br /><br />
