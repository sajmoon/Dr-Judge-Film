There are very few movies that actually make you think &quot;what if...&quot; after
you see them. This would definatly have to be one of them. The Matrix not
only has the BEST special effects of this century (Star Wars 1 was pitiful
compared to it,) but it have one of the best storylines of all time. It has
you leaving the theater asked yourself &quot;what if...&quot;
