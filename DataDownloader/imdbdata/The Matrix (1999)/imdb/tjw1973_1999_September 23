1999_September 23 

Though this movie will undoubtably be shunned for best picture at the Oscars
since it has a bit of SCI/FI, it is one of the most ground breaking and
historic movies of all time.  Though I was too young to see Star Wars when
it came out I have heard that audiences were in awe at the future of cinema
that stared them in the eyes.  That is the experience I had watching the
Matrix.  Not only does this movie boast one of the best plots out of
hollywood this decade, but this movie also shows us a new future of filming
movies.  Lucas may want the future to be about Jar Jar Binks and digital
non-human characters, but the rest of the world will want the future of
movies to take the rout that the Wachowski brothers have placed before the
world in the form of the Matrix. ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT.
