You walk into this film not knowing what the Matrix is. You take your seat
and watch the trailers. The green Warner Brothers (green? you ask) trademark
comes up, and without warning you are thrust into the Wachowski brothers
grand vision. 2 hours of excitement later, you stumble out of the cinema,
knowing what the Matrix is.<br /><br />This is one great movie. Keanu Reeves is cooler than cool as Neo. The
Wachowski brothers skilful direction is brilliant. The special effects
sequences will blow you away, did I mention the government lobby scene?<br /><br />The film starts off with a 'what is real?' first half, and then the first
kung-fu sequence makes way for an action- packed, John Woo-esque second half
with slomo and style cranked up all the way to the top. Did I mention the
government lobby scene?<br /><br />Keanu becomes Cool Keanu, Carrie-Anne Moss is a real find and Hugo Weaving
is perfect in his against typecasting role as the evil Agent Smith.<br /><br />You may notice in this review that I have not revealed what the Matrix is.
Like the trailer says, 'You have to see it for yourself.'<br /><br />Excellent. Best film of '99. 9/10.
