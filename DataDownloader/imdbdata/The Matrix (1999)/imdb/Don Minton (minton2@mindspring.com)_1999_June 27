1999_June 27 

I generally judge movies based on the premise that a well-crafted film
will
save a bad story, but a good story will not rescue bad
cinematography/production/design.  Overall, this movie rocks.  In premise
more than execution, though the execution was for the most part excellent
as
well.<br /><br />Ups:<br /><br />1.  Great plot premise.  There was actually a short episode very similar
to
this on the New Twilight Zone back in the 80's, where a guy kept getting
tracking lines on his idealized life.  May be one
of those rare occasions where the premise carries the execution, at least
in
my book.  I can think of several other ways they could have &quot;played&quot; the
same story and it would come off cool.<br /><br />2.  Wicked cool special effects and fight scenes.  The computer enhanced
action is actually supported by the plot premise, and is therefore not
gratuitous.  Pegged the eyecandy meter hard.<br /><br />3.  Use of tungsten or cross-processed film (or something) to give the
Matrix World a drab fluorescent tone.  Notice how green-skinned Keanu
looks
in several scenes.  Good subtle effect.<br /><br />4.  Great attention (too blatantly, in some scenes) to some incredibly
minute details.  Like the reflection in Morpheus' glasses, and the Uri
Geller kid's spoon.  Background stuff - title of Neo's book safe, stuff on
TV screens, etc.<br /><br />5.  Keanu Reeves - stiff as usual.  l was surprised at how it somehow
worked
this time.<br /><br />Downs (surprisingly few):<br /><br />1.  I would've preferred to see a much more techno-hip cyberpunk &quot;look&quot;
instead of the tired old industrial-gothic.  Postmodern influences were
relevant to both Blade Runner and Brazil's story-worlds, as well as the
era
in which they were created.  Batman and The Crow fit their comic book
settings.  Even the art deco noir in the more recent Dark City is
supported
by the plot premise (though there is NO excuse for the aliens to look like
Klaus Kinski's Nosferatu).   I understand that long coats are good for
hiding
guns. But
why have them wearing polished animal skins designed to keep trail dust
off
your &quot;good clothes&quot; on a long ride?  How archaic. Do you think the rebel
underground  would actually have the time to think about style?  And what
were they basing the look on?  An ancient pirated copy of last year's
Blade
starring Wesley Snipes in blackleathertrenchcoat, ironically dodging
bullets
in superslomo.?  (Morpheus' sunglasses are really cool, though.)   Come
on,
its 1999.  Goth is out.  Or at least it should be.  Its too fantastic, too
Victorian.  Terry Gilliam's &quot;future&quot; for 12 Monkey's, though somewhat
stylized,  put much more thought into what a world created by survivors
would look like.<br /><br />2.  Could be more inner turmoil with the hero character trying to figure
out
which world is real, who to believe, am I going insane?  Let Neo/Reeves
discover more of it himself instead of having everything spelled out for
him/us (per 12 Monkeys, or Angel Heart).  And we figure out what the hell
is
going on WAY too early in the story for my taste.  There is no Grand
Revelation at the end or no &quot;...or IS it??...&quot;.  That's the one missing
Rod
Serling moment.<br /><br />Fortunately this movie is all around good enough not to be forced into
&quot;for
a sci-fi flick&quot; or &quot;for a martial arts flick&quot; comparisons, though it
should be near the top of either category as well.  Unfortunately the
competition within the sci-fi genre is usually pretty weak -- even worse
if
you qualify only &quot;cyber&quot; movies.  I'm hoping the upcoming Neuromancer will
be worthy.<br /><br />
