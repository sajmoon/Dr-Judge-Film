How could a revolution be in technology age. It could be individual of
course. The one who access the reality will be enlightened and guide him (or
her)self. Rising to air without a machine? Why not if intended to do so.
This film has a genuine revolutionary, anarchist theme. The government,
police and the whole system with all the human beings are condemned.
Especially the humans who obey and do their individual affairs are primary
enemies. This film makes us think about many things about our
civiization.
