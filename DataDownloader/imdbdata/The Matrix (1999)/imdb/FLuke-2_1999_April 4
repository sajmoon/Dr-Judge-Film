1999_April 4 
...Everyone but people who don't like to think and don't enjoy stunning
visuals and action scenes. The plot could be described as &quot;the exact
opposite of the Lawnmower Man,&quot; and the feel of the film is strangely
similar to the computer game Half-Life.<br /><br />If you're the thinking type, The Matrix will leave you wondering for quite a
while. The all-inclusive plot and expert exposition are really the heart of
the film. Rarely does one see movies so well-thought-out and believable in
general release. Not only does this film take you on a mental trip, it makes
you think for yourself. If you're sick of all the condescending and
unimaginative SF films of the last few years, this is the
cure.<br /><br />If, on the other hand, you like to be blown away by startling shots and
powerful fights, The Matrix has you covered. The crew has done a great job
of creating an immersive environment that both dazzles and frightens. The
painfully tedious world of the Matrix and the post-apocalyptic Real World
are both rendered with great detail. The action, which seems to
unfortunately get the spotlight in many reviews, is, of course, fantastic.
You'll get the feeling that you're watching a video game as the characters
duke it out. The crazy moves that &quot;bend&quot; the laws of physics will keep your
eyes glued to the screen.<br /><br />All in all, this was one of the most believable SF movies I've seen in a
long time. When you see all the hard work that went into this movie (as
opposed to the half-a$$ed [or less] ones with which we're inundated), you'll
know it was worth the ticket price. Plus it's exciting! If you can't follow
it, at least you can just stare and have a good time.
