1999_October 12 

Not being a big fan of Keanu, (though I loved him in My Own Private) I
expected a rather weakly acted movie with some great effects. I was
pleasantly surprised. The role on Neo seems to have been written for Keanu
allowing him to be airheaded but with a reason.  I thoroughly enjoyed the
whole movie and watched it a second time the very next day, (something I've
never done before)  Its a definate must see.
