1999_April 15 

Incredible reality-bending effects, a Geiger-nightmare world and the
ongoing human struggle to convince ourselves we are not slaves to our own
creations, orchestrated to incredible industrial and drum and base and
dressed in vinyl trench coats and steel toed stomping boots......cyber-industrial-paranoia-from
hell.....I haven't had to scrape my jaw from the theatre floor like this
since Dark City.......ddddddaaaammmnnnnnnnn!!!!!<br /><br />And one  more thing....I am very happy that Mr.Reeves has finally been able
to break out of the Bill &amp; Ted typecast....you go boy!!!!!!!
