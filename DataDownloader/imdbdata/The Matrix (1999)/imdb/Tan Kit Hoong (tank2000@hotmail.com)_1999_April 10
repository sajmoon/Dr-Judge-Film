This movie has a story kinda like &quot;Dark City&quot;, but has the advantage over
the former in that it has Hong Kong Kung Fu choreographers to choreograph
the action scenes - that, coupled with some really impressive special
effects, results in a real kickass movie! Destined for action and sci-fi top
ten lists for years to come... <br /><br />
