Once again I see that people have misinterpreted this movie. Most of are
oooh ahhhing about what great special effects this has (and I guess most of
you are the computer obsessed generation that are set off by anything that
involves a micro-chip)but seem to be ignoring the philosophical point of
the
movie. Now don't get me wrong I thought the SFX, music, ect. part of the
movie was great, but what really fascinated me was the concept of the plot.<br /><br />The idea that something is controlling us (and no I am not referring to
god)
whilst we live our meek lives oblivious to it is something to think about.<br /><br />This movie tackles ideas that in our everyday lives we wouldn't dream of.
Ideas that only our eccentric producers /directors /writers dare to
explore.<br /><br />And then you have people who go and trash the whole idea, and compare it to
the most shallow of movies, (eg. terminator 2, okay what is it with that?).
This movie wasn't produced to blow you away with special effects, it was
produced to shock you with the idea that not all is what it seems.<br /><br />And yes I know that it was not an original idea, but it took the idea to a
different dimension.<br /><br />Give the Wachowski bro's just a
little credit for what they achieved because I sincerely doubt anyone could
produce anything half as good.
