1999_April 17 

I would have to say that the Matrix is my second favorite movie ever,
after
the Star Wars Trilogy. Although it is no means as powerful{obviously} as
films like Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List, it is a very
imagnative, exciting, superbly acted, film. I have a new respect for Keanu
Reeves. This film, I hope, will get nominated for some awards. It deserves
a
few, at least. I had huge expectations, and this film BLEW THEM AWAY. It
is
violent, but the language is very tame. There was not a single use of the
f-word anywhere! That's impressive. This is one of the best movies I have
ever seen. I mean it. I won't try and describe how amazing it is. It can't
be done.
