1999_August 1 

Ok, im in the cinema with a friend, the film has just began rolling, and i
think: this is just to slow!!!, but after about
30 minutes i begin to like this film, and i am thinking: this film is good!,
very good!. The Visual effects are on the top, the acting is great, and,
everything is great!. 1 hour and 45 minutes later, i sit outside the cinema
on a bench, and thinking something like this: wow!, what a film!, i have to
burn my film collection up! I give this film 9,9 out of
10!
