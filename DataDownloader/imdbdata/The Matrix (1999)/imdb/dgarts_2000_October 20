2000_October 20 

I can't begin to express how much I enjoyed this film. I planned not to see
it, until a friend of mine referred to it in a discussion we were having.
I'm not a Keannu Reeves fan, and
thought it'd just be fluff, but when he referred to it
in
the context of our discussion, it definitely raised my
eyebrows, so I rented it, and was glad I did.<br /><br />For any who have pondered the enduring questions in life,
this
film is delightful. The fundamental issues of reality (metaphysical
questions), knowledge and truth (epistemological questions) and a little bit
of axiology are wrapped in a slick
futuristic skin.<br /><br />At the point Reeves' character is first introduced into the matrix, and has
difficulty believing what is &quot;real,&quot; I asked the question out loud just as
Lawrence asked it: &quot;what IS 
reality?&quot; <br /><br />Ringing with relevance and clarity, this movie presents
hyperbolie in addressing some of the nagging questions in
life.<br /><br />Skim an introductory philosophy textbook if this is unfamiliar
territory -- after doing so, you may just agree with me
that
this is definitely one for the ages.
