The Matrix is a good, entertaining movie. Spectacular visual effects and
amazing sound. It would be easy to write this movie off if it did not
essentially deliver what it was made to do: entertain. I don't know if the
Wachowski brothers were trying to include a deeper, almost philosophical
meaning to the movie, but I didn't watch it for that. I watched it to be
entertained. There are movies that can be entertaining and deliver a
powerful message at the same time... I think this one failed in the latter.
The Matrix is, I'll say again, good entertainment. It deserved its Academy
Awards by all means, but for it to be in the Top 50 Greatest IMDb movies is
outrageous. Maybe this movie will be the foundation for all science fiction
movies to come within the next 20 years, we've already seen evidence of
that. What if there were no special effects? The famous sci-fi films like
Star Wars and E.T. would not be as outstanding without the special effects,
but there would still be a good movie there. Now The Matrix, take away the
visual effects, what do you have? Basically a poor screenplay and some lousy
actors.
