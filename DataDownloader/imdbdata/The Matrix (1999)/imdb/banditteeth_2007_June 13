OVERRATED!!! This is nothing but dressed-up fodder for sexless
pizza-faced losers. It&#39;s not as as smart as you think it is, people.
Also, look at the subsequent installments and the Wachowski brothers
other work. These guys wrote &quot;Assassins&quot;. Yeah. Geniuses. Plus, it&#39;s
terrible casting to put so many great actors in such BORING roles.
These people for the most part just let dialogue dribble out of their
mouths like they&#39;re reading it from an insurance contract. Why? Because
that&#39;s how the script is written. Hey, maybe the script was written by
a highly intelligent being that exists in an alternate reality where
humans are subservient to robot screenwriters! snore. And by the way,
everyone keeps talking about how innovative the &quot;bullet time&quot; sequence
was? Well, sorry to say that Buffalo &#39;66 did the same thing a year
before. So even THAT wasn&#39;t original. Let&#39;s pretend this movie doesn&#39;t
exist. Starting...NOW!
