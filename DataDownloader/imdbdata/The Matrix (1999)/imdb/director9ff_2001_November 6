To think that I actually thought that this was the greatest movie ever! I
have seen this about 9 times (this is an estimate), and now I know that
great story means little to a film's overal quality!<br /><br />I know nothing about philosophy! Thus, I can't judge the film'sidea of our
somewhat &quot;cool&quot; world (didn't mean to conjure up bad images of Brad Pitt,
sorry) is simply a front for the real world, one that looks so drab. in my
idea, it could b, but so much is unexplained...<br /><br />Rating: 3/6
