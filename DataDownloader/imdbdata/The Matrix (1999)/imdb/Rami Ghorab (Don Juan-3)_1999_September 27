The Matrix, takes you to another world, or should I say another LEVEL. The
movie brings out the same old question : FATE!!   Is everyone in control of
himself, or is another external force controlling us.&gt;<br /><br /> Neo (Keanu Reeves) is off to find the answer. Suddenly he finds himself  in
this very cool, action packed movie : &quot; The Matrix&quot; . He has to face Ai-men
(Artificial Intelligence) that can take over the life of any human and
capture his body.<br /><br />One of the best scenes in this movie was when Neo faces one of the Ai-men
and has to maneuver bullets on a rooftop of a skyscraper. Very cool and
sharp visual effects  were applied in this great movie.<br /><br />Also very cool character performed by Laurence Fishburne.&gt;<br /><br />That movie is a must see. 10/10.<br /><br />
