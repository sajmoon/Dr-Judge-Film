The Matrix is one of the very best science fiction films of all time.
Like George Lucas did with Star Wars, Andy and Larry Wachowski create a
fascinating world with a different history. Everybody thinks the year
is 1999. But in the real world it is closer to 2099 and the world is a
very different place. Our reliance on machines has backfired and they
have taken over, harvesting humans and connecting them to a system
called the matrix, where humans live and think like it is modern day.
The story follows of a group of rebels who escaped the matrix who find
who they think is their savior, Neo (Keanu Reeves). What follows is an
action-packed thrill ride, with an excellent story, and a perfect
performance by Hugo Weaving, who plays Agent Smith, a computer program
assigned to stop any human resistance.<br /><br />The action scenes completely blow you away. With old-school wire fu,
they create a classic sparring session between Neo and Morpheus
(Laurence Fishburne). And with extraordinary special effects, they
crafted one of the best action sequences ever made in the lobby
shootout. Tons of bullets, bodies, and shattered walls fill the screen
while a great soundtrack blasts across the room. It has to be seen.<br /><br />While the two sequels were very good, they didn't come close to living
up to the first installment, that has set a new standard for
science-fiction that will take a heck of a lot to reach. 8/10
