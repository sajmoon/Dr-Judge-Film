Great movie! I went to see it thinking that, like some recent movies, I
would only see good special effects. I was wrong. Matrix has, more than
nothing, an incredible sci-fi plot. It may seem kind of bizarre but, at the
end, everything has sense. I am sure this film will set a &quot;before and
after&quot;
in sci-fi movies.
