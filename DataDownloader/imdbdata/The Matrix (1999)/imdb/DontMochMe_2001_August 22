When I first went in to see this movie I expected it to be one of those
lame
action movies (not my favorite genre). I was seeing it only for the special
effects. But when I actually saw the film I was very pleasently surprised.
It was excellent. It had everything a movie should. You MUST see this movie
to experience it. Also, another great thing about this movie is the
religious discussions it can bring up (after the movie). A must see. Kat
rates this film, &quot;An excellent must see for everyone!!&quot;
