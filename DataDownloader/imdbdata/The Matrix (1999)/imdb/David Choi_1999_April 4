1999_April 4 

The &quot;living&quot; world has come to an end.  Mankind's own technological advances
have turned against them.  Now, computers are the primary inhabitants of
Planet Earth...  The humans have been turned into slaves by this master race
of super-intelligent beings controlled by the CPU known as &quot;The Matrix.&quot;
This devastated world appears to be a nightmare...but it is only too real...<br /><br />Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a computer hacker, unknowingly living in a virtual
reality world created by The Matrix in order to keep him in check.  The
Matrix fabricates synthetic worlds for many people in order to suppress any
potential insurgence.  However, an underground resistance group led by
Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and his officer, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss,
looking lovely in that black leather outfit) must pull Neo out from his
fantasies...and force him to face the grim reality as it is...<br /><br />A Prophecy has been spoken.  The Oracle, a spiritual guide for the remnants
of the human race has professed Neo to be that special person, the &quot;Chosen
One.&quot;  However, is Neo indeed the &quot;Chosen One?&quot;  If he is, can he exhibit
the valor and courage that the Oracle has supposedly prophesized for this
specific soul?<br /><br />In a world ruled by computers and machines, these people are our last hope.
The heroes must valiantly fight the main CPU inside the VR system...or die
trying...  With the abilities to dodge flying bullets and to increase their
own upper body strengths, the human players do have the upper hand...
However, can Neo, Morpheus and Trinity lead the human race into victory, or
will the machines forever rule the planet?<br /><br />THE MATRIX is a neat, thinking man's science-fiction thriller.  The
ambitious production design is demonstrated with some spectacular action
scenes laced with great special FX.  This virtual reality world with
provocative imagery will enrapture the human soul as he/she will experience
a journey unlike any peregrination in the real world.  This film is visually
appetizing...with lavish, computer generated special effects. The high-tech
setting will expand your imagination to new horizons. As well, the
ambiguous, though-provoking story will keep your minds thinking constantly
as you try to solve the stratagem behind this brain twister of a concept...<br /><br />Masterful stunt-work, especially the martial arts choreography by Yuen Wo
Ping and endless firepower is integrated with astonishing, maniacal FX.  The
much anticipated comic book violence is enhanced by plenty of digital
effects.  In this way, characters can perform virtually endless tricks from
the book including acrobatic movements and flying jump kicks to
gravity-defying combat battles.  Much of the special effects are epitomized
in the shape of those &quot;Sentinels,&quot; bizarre spider androids with unfathomable
powers.  The scenes transitioning VR to reality and vice versa are
astounding also.<br /><br />A few shortcomings in THE MATRIX cannot be ignored such as a complicated
plot with loose ends and some occasional slowdown in the film's pace.  The
plot in THE MATRIX is indeed convoluted, but this film will probably require
several viewing before you can truly grasp the heart of the matter.  Also,
some sections of this movie are a bit hamstrung, but the rapid-fire action
compensates for most of the plodding segments.<br /><br />Is this film overly meretricious?  Maybe.  Appeasing to the naked eye?
Definitely!  Will you have fun watching this movie?  You bet.  Although THE
MATRIX is sometimes uneven, garish and twisted, this motion picture is
groundbreaking work from the brotherly duo, directors Andy and Larry
Wachowski. If you have enough of an attention span to endure the film's
slow-moving sequences, than prepare to be warped into an artificially
created world where rules are not bound, laws are meaningless, and nothing
is what it seems...  Aficionados who are devoted to &quot;cyber-punk&quot; thrillers
should not miss this one!<br /><br />RATING: *** out of ****.
