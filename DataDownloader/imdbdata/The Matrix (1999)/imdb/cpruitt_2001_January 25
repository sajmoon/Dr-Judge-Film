This movie is easily one of the top 10 sci-fi/action film ever but c'mon,
they can move faster than bullets so the heroes grab GUNS??  Stupid plot
point, lazy actually.  The visuals are outstanding and the mystery of
'reality' is the selling point.. the part Keanu was born to play (because he
didnt have to act).  8.5/10
