When Ted, sorry, NEO, and Morpheus sit down in a white backdrop and
Fishburne asks, &quot;What is the 'Matrix,' you have undoubtedly witnessed one of
the worst scenes ever in cinematic history. THE MATRIX is very betraying
unto itself, for what good is kung fu if it is not blended in with what also
has made the BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER television series so great? THE MATRIX
needed kung fu and sex to blend in with what already was boring. The special
effects and Hugo Weaving are great, but everything else
lacks.<br /><br />What is the Matrix? A computer hacker is about to find out the hard
way.<br /><br />Bad, bad, bad acting, almost as terrible as BLADE RUNNER. What a waste of
special effects, though, since the camera trick was very revolutionary for
its time. Oh well. Science fiction deserves better than THE MATRIX, for an
entire movie with guns and kung fu should have been far more fun than
becoming downright serious in its lunacy. Boring.
