1999_November 21 

&quot;Forget about the screenplay, it's all about the effects&quot;, they said.<br /><br />When I went to see the film at an exclusive midnight premiere I didn't
know
anything about the film. 144 minutes later I decided to never go to an
exclusive midnight premiere again. The punishment was the knowledge that I
would not be able to see the film again until its official screening one
full week later. Somehow I survived.<br /><br />The story is mind-blowing and discusses a lot of essential questions about
reality, everyday life, who each one of us is and who decided it that way.<br /><br />The protagonist, Thomas Andersen, not really satisfied with his existence
as
an average employee, finally gets the contact he had always been seeking.
A
group of ,matrix-resistant' individuals share their knowledge about the
,matrix' with him and furthermore tell him that he was chosen to put an
end
to that fake reality.<br /><br />The exposition of the story and the characters is great. The film starts
within the very first second but still leaves the viewer unsure about what
,really' is going on. Is Thomas A. Anderson only dreaming? Or is he really
,Neo'? Is ,Neo' more than just a night-life name? Is ,Neo' Thomas A.
Andersons true identity? The way the story unfolds is thrilling and the
turning points come with good timing. One of two weak points in the story
comes when the writers-directors must get Neo to confront his antagonist.
Trinity at that point has to play the poor part of bringing on the delay.
The way we got to know her throughout the film makes it anything but
convincing that she would start long talks at that rather delicate moment.<br /><br />Whoever wants to criticize Keanu Reeves for his acting probably has a
problem with actors that don't show that they are acting while they are
acting. He's not in flirtation with the audience or the critics while he's
performing. He's too busy doing a great and extremely convincing job. I
have
never been a fan or something so please consider me as neutral. Lawrence
Fishburne is the most charismatic Morpheus I could ever imagine, and the
rest of the cast is the perfect choice also. Carrie-Anne Moss handles the
extremes between the cool ,matrix-trinity' and the sensitive
,reality-trinity' impressively well. Stock music rarely works in movies
but
when Rage Against The Machine hit it after Neo flies away in the end,
something just works.<br /><br />I don't see ,The Matrix' as bringing on  easy answers. Every answer is
followed by a question, and ,the one' in the end only becomes ,the one'
because he chose himself to become ,the one'. Nothing more, nothing less.
While the matrix is all clean and colorful, reality is dirty and cold. The
parts of the dialogue who deal with essential questions (like &quot;what is the
matrix&quot;) are brilliantly written and convincing -apart from that other
weak
point that irritates me, concerning the machines and how they got the
power.
I suggest you go and check that for yourself ...<br /><br />It's surprising to see deep-thought-subjects being discussed in a
,mainstream' Hollywood movie -especially at that length. Since the
Wachowski
Brothers had troubles to get the project financed, it might not be that
,mainstream' anyway. In fact, at least the outlook of the film is
,avant-garde'. Ground-breaking camera-technology and breathtaking
choreography of the fighting scenes team up with innovative direction.
Neo's
,wake-up' scene in the incubator, the showdown or ,the white room' won't
be
forgotten so fast.<br /><br />Since the first human being was walking on the planet, there have been
speculations about what is real, if or how that might be proven, and what
kind of consequences that might have. Therefore not too many themes could
be
more classical than the one of ,The Matrix'. But it's not only classical,
to
some it might be scary: it invites us to see parallels in our world,
igniting questions about who -based on what kind of legitimacy- makes all
the rules and how much power each of us has in that game.<br /><br />The choice of the theme and the way the theme is presented is what truly
makes this film the first film of the next millennium. It already has
entered movie history.<br /><br />
