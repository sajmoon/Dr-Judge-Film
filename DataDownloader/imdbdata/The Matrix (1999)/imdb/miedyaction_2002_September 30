There was many similarities between the Christian faith and The Matrix.
Perhaps it was completely unintentional but there was quite a few
parallels.
Many characters in the movie corresponded with characters from The
Bible,
and some of the stories in the bible matched up with the storyline and
the
plot of The Matrix.  Neo was like Jesus, Morpheus was like John the
Baptist,
Trinity was like Mary, and Cypher was like Judas.  Judas betrayed Jesus
just
as Cypher betrayed Morpheus and Neo.  Also the rebirth of Neo was alot
like
baptism.  Cypher was in many ways exactly like Judas, and The Matrix
could
be seen as a comparison to our world.  I think there was alot of
similarities between The Matrix and The Bible and one really good one was
how morpheus gave his life for Neo, even though the characters were
different it lines up with Jesus' death on the cross.
