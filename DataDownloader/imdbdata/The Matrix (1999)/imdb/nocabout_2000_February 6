Not much to say.  Except unbelievably brilliant. Great costumes, great
acting, and cute boys.  Many layers of meaning from mythological symbolism
to corrollation with the story of the Buddha's enlightenment.  Even the
character's names mean something.  The next great science fiction film
trilogy is underway, and it's not directed by George Lucas.  Do yourself a
favor, even if you don't get it, pretend you do.  This one is destined to
be
a classic.
