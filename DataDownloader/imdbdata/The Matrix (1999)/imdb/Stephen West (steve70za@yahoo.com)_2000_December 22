This movie is an absolute tour-de-force.It took my breathe away and captured
my imagination for weeks to follow.'High concept' is so necessary of big
budget productions and the Wachowski brothers deliver.The only weak point is
the dialogue and some of Neo's weak comments were most unbecoming of the
saviour of the world.This is nonetheless overshadowed by a strong
story,awe-inspiring special effects and solid performances by the emsemble
cast. <br /><br />To truly appeciate this movie,the only medium worth viewing it on outside a
cinema would be a DVD.The DVD is a must for all fans since it provides
insight into the making of a mega sci-fi movie.<br /><br />I look forward to the sequels and I am sure that the Wachowski brothers will
get back to work in their usual passionate way to produce trilogy- like
episodes.<br /><br />Lucas would have loved to have this movie to his name but for me Star Wars
is still the benchmark against which all sci-fi productions must be measured
by if only for the reason that it is a true trilogy.
