From the very first minute of The Matrix i was hooked. The engaging
storyline, the fantastic acting and the astonishing special effects all
added to my appreciation of the masterpiece.<br /><br />The Wachowski brothers have created a movie which is not only
aesthetically
pleasing but also makes us question our existence.<br /><br />For me the standout was the kung-fu action scenes as well as the ideas and
questions that this movie puts in our minds.  The script is amazing and i
love reciting the phrases said by Keanu over and over again.<br /><br />All of the actors played their parts brilliantly - Keanu Reeves was great
as
the ultra-cool Neo.<br /><br />Overall i rate this film 9/10 because it seems top get better and better
every time i watch it.
