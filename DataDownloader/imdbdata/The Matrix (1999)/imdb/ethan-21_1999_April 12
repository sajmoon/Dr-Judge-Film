With all the Star Wars hype, this movie may be overlooked. I feel that it
has an amazingly intricate plot, wonderful effects, and solid importance. I
left the theatre with a glowing feeling after seeing a great hero emerge
(Neo.) I never thought I would say that about Mr. Reeves in a film.<br /><br />This movie is amazing and well deserves its success.<br /><br />ET
