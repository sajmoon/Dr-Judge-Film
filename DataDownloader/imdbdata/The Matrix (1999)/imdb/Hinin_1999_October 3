1999_October 3 

I saw it.  I liked it.  I saw it again...  and again.<br /><br />One of the beset things about this film is the use of its visuals.  The
effects are not overdone but are executed in a manner that accentuates the
mood in an extremely appropriate way.<br /><br />Plot has a couple of good twists and some of the actors' performances are
appropriate for the genre (I wouldn't say Oscar material
though).<br /><br />Not perfect for me but, oh, so close with 9/10
