In The Matrix, Keanu Reeves plays a hacker who finds out that the world is
actually a computer simulation and that he is the only one who can free
the
human race. This is the best movie I've ever seen. Excellent sfx, good
fighting scenes, and the plot is completely believable. Agent Smith,
Trinity, and Morpheus are the best characters. Question
Reality!
