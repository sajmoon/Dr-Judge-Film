1999_April 6 

The Matrix is definitely a fun ride.  The FX, the bad guys, the story
line,
are all exciting and definitely worth going to the movies to see.
However,
I certainly hope that this does not a start a trend in movies in which the
dialog is sacrificed for the gee-whiz special effects.  The script in the
film is pretty close to horrible, despite the numerous opportunities for
some intelligent and witty lines.  Agent Smith seemed to be a character
that
was just dying to utter some truly memorable phrases, but not one was
spoken
from his cybernetic lips, despite Hugo Weaving's best effort to make
something out of his portion of the script.  The rest of the characters
too
were mute in terms of decent dialog, and this made each of them just a
little less substantial and shallow.  Only Trinity seemed to have any
substance, but that was due to a pretty good job of acting from
Carrie-Anne
Moss and the allowance of her character to express an emotion other than
fear or defiance...love<br /><br />One things for sure, The Matrix is the best commercial for sunglasses I've
ever seen.
