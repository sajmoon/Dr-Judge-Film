I know this is the Matrix comment area, but I must lend agreement to
others'
comments re Phantom Menace.It truly disappointed. And whose idea was it to
insult our intelligence with the computer generated buffoon-JaJaBinks? or
something. Clearly the need to sell dolls to kids in the aftermarket
superseded the need to produce a quality sci-fi flick! O well, I guess they
are prepared to deduct lower receipts for the next movie from their toy
windfall-cause I'll see the next one on cable!   NOW, about a REAL
movie-The
MATRIX! How could one not be enthralled by the concept of this movie. One
has only to look at any action movie made since 1999 to test this movie's
influence on the action movie genre. From Shrek to Charlie's Angels to
Crouching Tiger-Matrix has left it's mark with special effects. But beyond
that, thc concept of machines turning the tables and using humankind for
energy units was staggering. And that in conjunction with the breeding
grounds and the energy fields reaping wattage from millions of humans while
they dream on of a reality that doesn't exist numbed my thought process for
a half hour after Keanu/Neo woke up in the glass bathtub/toilet. I can't
understand those who deride the movie for lack of originality. I mean,
sure,machines vs humans is not new-but the manner in which this one was
presented was so radical, and that's from an avid sci-fi reader for the
last
20 years! I only wish I could see it again for the first time so I could
attempt to figure out what the hell the Matrix is before it is revealed!
And
my only disappointment is that the Tank character is to be portrayed by an
different actor. I was impressed by his role and performance.Well I am also
disappointed by the length of time we have to wait for the sequel. Hey does
anyone know if it is true that they are shooting Matrix 2 &amp; 3 at the same
time? Finally, it is ridiculous to suggest that Carrie Moss cannot act.
Have
you seen &quot;Memento&quot;?
