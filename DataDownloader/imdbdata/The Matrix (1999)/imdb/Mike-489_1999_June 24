1999_June 24 

This is terrific fun, the last time a picture had this effect upon me it
was
Star Wars back in the 1970s.<br /><br />I didn't find the storyline as convoluted as some claim &amp; soon got the
hang
of what was going on. Basically it plays to every teenager's feeling that
reality is somehow flawed &amp; that they can just perceive this, not from the
outside, but right on the edge. The Matrix takes that to fantastical
extremes.<br /><br />The special effects are superb &amp; the violence graphic. This is the first
time I've ever seen a true representation of what a rifle bullet will do
to
scenery for a start! But don't let that distract you &amp; certainly don't go
to
see it just for the effects, there's a staggeringly good plot in there
too.<br /><br />All the actors are well chosen, with what must be a first, Keanu Reeves
proving he can act. It's good to see him a in decent part like this, the
best he's played since Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey. Lawrence Fishburn is
always a bit wooden for me, but he's perfected his persona &amp; plays it for
all he has which fits this film like a glove. With the support of Carrie
Anne Moss sex oozes from all the lead actors. This is a very well thought
out series of images, even the bad guys are cool, have depth &amp;
interest.<br /><br />There's little doubt that the action sequences have been heavily
influenced
by the likes of John Woo &amp; his contemporaries in the Hong Kong school of
direction. It could have been rather over the top &amp; might have dominated
things, but it's well pitched &amp; adds to the mix just right.<br /><br />There's little to fault the plot, although the story rather skips any
explanation of why Reeves is &quot;The One&quot; this is understandable. Also anyone
who knows about the Second Law of Thermodynamics may object to the
explanation of how the humans are kept fed by the machines, since it's a
cold world with no sun by the look of it. But these are very, very minor
points.<br /><br />Overwhemingly this is a staggeringly good film, it has plot, style,
sexyness, good effects &amp; gripping action. For your dollar or your pound,
this has to be the bargain of the year, giving far more in one sitting
than
all the others I've seen this year.<br /><br />Only one question remains. Was it a good thing to release humans from the
Matrix? After all it's possibly humans that screwed up the world
environment
in the first place. Inside the Matrix they still live in the comfort of
the
late 20th Century, oblivious to the suffering &amp; struggle that would await
them in the real world of 2199 ad. An interesting dilemma,
no?
