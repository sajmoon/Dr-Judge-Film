1999_April 5 

I liked it, but can anyone say &quot;sleeping beauty&quot;, (you'll see it when you
do). Other than that little brain fart on the part of the writer. the movie
plot and special effects were great, as far as Keanu's acting ability this
(in my opinion, of course what else am I going to write in) is the best
movie he has ever done. Laurence Fishburne did a great job also (as
expected). I also think it is going into my sci-fi collection the instance
it is released in to the public......<br /><br />&yen; Dal &yen;
