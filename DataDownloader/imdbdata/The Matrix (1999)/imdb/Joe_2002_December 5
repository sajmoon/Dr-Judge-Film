A lot of people have commented on the parallels
between The Matrix and the Bible.  There is an obvious
parallel between Neo and Jesus.  Not only does Neo
become a savior to the people, events in the movie
symbolize Jesus' baptism, rebirth, death, and
resurrection.  It's hard to believe that all the
similarities are just by chance.  Everything fits,
even the other characters portray the various people
who affected the life of Jesus.  Morpheus is
reminiscent of John the Baptist who began the ministry
of Christ.  Cypher was obviously the Judas figure. 
The other crew members can be seen as disciples, having
some doubt at the beginning of the story, but totally
believing at the end.
Whether these parallels are intentional or not, I think
they're
pretty interesting.
