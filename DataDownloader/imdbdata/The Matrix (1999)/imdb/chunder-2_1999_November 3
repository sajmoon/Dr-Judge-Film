Definitely the best action movie this year. Knocked the socks off The
Phantom Menace by far. Very cunning storyline and plot, amazing stunts, and
stunning special effects.
An action movie with a scary science fictional twist, incorporating guns,
fighting, lots of explosions and a good laugh along the way.
Superb!
Only bad point is that it doesn't have quite the same effect the following
times you see it.
One for the video collection methinks.
