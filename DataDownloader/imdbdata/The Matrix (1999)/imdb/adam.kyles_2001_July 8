What can I say? Watch it whatever you have to do! Even if you have to shoot
someone to get it! This is in my top five favourate movies of all time, and
good reason! This has only one fault: (a) its almost as depressing as Blade
Runner. This is pale in comerparison to the (a) comments on the nature of
reality,(b)charicterisation and good acting and (c) mind-blowing special
effects. Look, read the other comments if you don't believe me, but please
watch this film sometime in your life!
