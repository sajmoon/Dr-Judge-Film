1999_April 4 

This movie was just a plain good time. Excellent story mixed with awesome
special effects mixed with sometimes decent (Reeves), sometimes pretty good
(Pantoliano), and sometimes awesome (Fishburne, Moss, and Weaving) acting.
Also the oracle was totally unexpected. Good flick. <br /><br />
