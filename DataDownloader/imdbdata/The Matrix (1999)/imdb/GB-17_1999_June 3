The Matrix was the best movie ever. It had an amazing plot that still
awes me, it had amazing special effects and great fighting scenes, it's
only
problem was Keanu Reeves. If you haven't seen this movie, see it even
though Keanu Reeves is in it. It's still the best movie ever. You know
what
they should have done? They should have gotten Charlie Sheen to star in
it.
That woulda been aweseome.
