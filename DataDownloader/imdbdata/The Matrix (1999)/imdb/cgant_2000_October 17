Because I agree with the positive comments about this film, I'm not even
gonna go there except to chime in about it being one of the best films I've
ever seen.  What struck me was Hugo Weaving's range.  After seeing &quot;Bedrooms
and Hallways&quot; I can't even believe it's the same guy.  Everything about him
is different.  His voice, his carriage.  I know that's why they call it
acting, but Agent Smith is a huge departure from anything else I've seen him
in.
