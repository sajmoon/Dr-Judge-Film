1999_June 13 

Astounding, faultless, incredible cyber-action. Rescued from the low of
Johnny Mnemonic to play the role of his career, &quot;Canoe&quot; gives a slick
performance as Thomas 'Neo' Anderson.<br /><br />If you're reading this, you know the plot by now. All that remains is for
me
to add my praise to that I've already read here.<br /><br />Quite simply the best movie of this genre I've ever seen.
