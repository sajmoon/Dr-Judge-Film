Whoa, was this a feast for your eyes or what?  A cinematic delight.  I
generally think Keanu Reeves is the work actor out there, but he delivers
nicely in this film.  The plot is a based on a concept that is so
unbelievable that I couldn't believe the directors would die write it, let
alone try it.  It caught my eye right away and my eye just grew wider and
wider per shot.  The epic battle between good and evil has reached a new
pinnacle with this  film.  The fighting scenes are done with great
cinematography and the whole movie is just completely beautiful to look
at.
