1999_June 15 

This is what a movie is meant to be, intelligent, driven, action-packed,
but
not cheesy and over done.  Perfect combination of suspended disbelief and
realistic philosophy.  Just when your brain is about to explode from trying
to completely grasp the concept, a helicopter crashes into a building and
there is fire and death and chaos.  This movie is a &quot;10&quot; in everything from
Screenplay to Special Effects to Kung Fu-ism.  A definite box-office must
see.
