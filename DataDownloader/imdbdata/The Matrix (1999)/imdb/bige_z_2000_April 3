2000_April 3 

The first time that I finished watching &quot; The Matrix &quot;, I couldn't
wait
to see it again. This movie has everything that every good movie has,
thats
why its a great movie. This movie is Action Action Action. Not one second
of
this movie is boring at all. The movie carries out a plot that keeps you
thinking about your life in a different way. Every time I eat a steak, I
think, this tastes good, but is it real? The few people that don't like
this
movie because you think that the plot was too confusing, must of watched
the
movie with earplugs or something, cus Morpheus spends almost the whole
movie
explaining what the Matrix is and what the Agents are trying to do. So
there
shouldn't be anything not to understand. And then there's the FX. Oh man,
this movie really takes the special efects to another level. The way they
were able to make those eye-catching effects along with the sound effects
was amazing. No other movie has been able to do that, except maybe &quot; The
Fifth Element&quot;. But overall this is a must see, and I give it a
Ten.
