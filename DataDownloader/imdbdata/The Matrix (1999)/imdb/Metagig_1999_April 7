1999_April 7 

The Matrix has a well developed plot and a great cast of characters.  I was
very hesitant going to this movie due to the fact that Keanu Reeves was the
lead.  But, I had no need to worry, he finally proved to me that he is worth
seeing in a film.  The fight scenes were amazing along with all the special
effects.  This movie surpassed my expectations beyond anything I could have
imagined.  The plot was exciting, yet it made you think and ponder about our
own existence.  I recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 18 who can
definitely appreciate everything that is going on.  Go See
It!!
