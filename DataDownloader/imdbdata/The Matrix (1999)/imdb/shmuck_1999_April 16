Despite Keanu, despite the plot holes, despite the horrendous ending, the
Matrix was a good movie.  The story made no sense, but at least they didn't
try to explain anything (which would have been disastrous), and with the
special effects and pace they almost got away.  I am just happy to learn
there are still people out there who do think when they watch a movie!  Too
bad for the Matrix, the more you think, the less you like it.  But IF you
can just stare at the screen and enjoy the moment...  Ah ignorance is bliss!
Hmm, maybe &quot;the Matrix&quot; does has some social commentary to it, what a
thought!
