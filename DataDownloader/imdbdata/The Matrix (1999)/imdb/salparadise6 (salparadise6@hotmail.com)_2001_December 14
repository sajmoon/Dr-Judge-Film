Matrix is a good movie, and history will show that it is the movie that
made
the DVD, as people went out and bought players to watch this movie.
Innovative stunts and filming, you dont even notice reeves as the poor
actor
he is.  Fishburn is- as usual- strong, and whoever plays agent smith does a
great job.  the Computer graffics left something to be desired (im a
spoiled
STAR WARS brat), but great music and its paced well.  I felt the plot was
rather predictable (when i start saying whats going to happen, then it must
be obvious) and the religious and philosophical aspects were less than
subtle, and i defy anyone to say this movie was &quot;deep.&quot;  Nevertheless,
along
with Gladiator and Episode 1, the Matrix is a movie that should be in every
dvd collection
