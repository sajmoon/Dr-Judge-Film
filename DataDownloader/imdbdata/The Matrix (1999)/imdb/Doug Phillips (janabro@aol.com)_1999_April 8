1999_April 8 

WOW!<br /><br />I was very pleasantly surprised at this film.<br /><br />There is actually a very good and very dark story.<br /><br />The special effects only add to the story instead of detracting from
it.<br /><br />All of the supporting characters turned in performances that were just a
hair short of being truly great.<br /><br />Friends of mine that do not usually like either science fiction or special
effects films liked it very much as well.<br /><br />And, as one of them put it &quot;Keanu Reeves does not ruin the
movie.&quot;<br /><br />This movie will not translate well to video -- the special effects and the
sound (which was also incredible) just will not work on a small screen -- so
I strongly suggest that you DO NOT wait for it to come out on video and see
it in a theater with the sound system that will support this
movie.<br /><br />Enjoy.
