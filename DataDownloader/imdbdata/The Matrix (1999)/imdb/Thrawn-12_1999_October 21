1999_October 21 

I was skeptical about this movie, but when I finished watching it, I was
like, this was one of the best movies ever. It has so much Biblical
allusions that one could take this movie as Reeve's character being the
Messiah in the modern world. <br /><br />And, probably the most little brought up issue in the movie is the love
story between Neo and Trinity...it is only explored at the end. It is a
small part of the movie, but when you think about it, it IS the movie. This
is how love stories are. I can't even explain it, I can't even describe it.<br /><br />You should see the movie. You'll leave it thinking that it is a love story
that wasn't even really told. Like I said, it doesn't make sense to say
that, but it does. Those who have seen it know what i am talking
about.
