1999_July 29 

Without wanting to gush I enjoyed this film like no other in the last few
years.  My favourite film since its release was &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and I class
this film as being in the same league of thrilling sci-fi with superb
special effects and an exciting storyline.  Keanu Reeves stares perfectly at
the camera in closeup, although his actual acting is a little well -
Keanuesque (never having thrown the mantel of Bill and Ted) I think. Samuel
L Jackson is as cool as cool and Trinity is superb.  I will be going to see
this one again and again and await with anticipation the next film by the
brothers.
