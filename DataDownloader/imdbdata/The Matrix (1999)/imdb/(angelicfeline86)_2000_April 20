2000_April 20 

The film had very breath-taking graphics.  For instance, the scene where
Morpheus is rescued and Neo dodges bullets is inexplicably choreographed
perfectly.  Most of the action films that I see are unrealistic.  It
doesn't
seem like it could happen, but this film is different, somehow.  I can't
explain it.  Also, the idea that the movie presents is shockingly
plausible.
Although, I doubt it, I'm always on the lookout for agents.  If you don't
gather anything from the movie, at least get this.  Do not try and bend the
spoon. That's impossible. Instead... only try to realize the truth.  There
is no spoon.  Then you'll see, that it is not the spoon that bends, it is
only yourself.  ~Oracle~
