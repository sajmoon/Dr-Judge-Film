2001_January 9 

I really can't understand all of the accolades that this film continues to
receive.  Has the entire world gone insane and forgotten that what makes a
good movie is its script.  Has everything become about special effects,
special effects and more special effects?   Sure, if you want special
effects, this is definitely the movie for you.  If I was writing this
entry
for the Special Effects Message Board, I would have given it a 10/10
rating.
But frankly, I need more than great visuals to have a movie work for me
and
as this film has nothing else, it gets a 1 rating.<br /><br />I know my rating won't dissuade the masses from singing the praises of
this
movie.  I know that my rating won't stop the inevitable outcome of Matrix
II
becoming the highest grossing film of all time during its opening weekend.
Perhaps the only thing this review will do is lead like minded people in
the
direction of other movies that deal with similar themes yet actually have
characters that you will care about.<br /><br />Let me make clear, that the core concept of Matrix is a great one.  The
whole idea of our world being part of someone else's imagination is
something that has fascinated me for as long as I can remember.  When
Matrix
originally debuted, you couldn't have paid me to stay away from the
theater.
Someone had finally put one of the great philosophic debates into movie
form and I knew that it had to be incredible.   Instead, the only thing
incredible about the film (beside the special effects) was how wrong I had
been.<br /><br />There on the screen was a movie without any real screenplay.  No matter
how
much I tried, I couldn't bring myself to care about these characters
because
they just weren't real.   You would think that in a film dealing with
reality-as-you-know-it crumbling around the main characters, that there
would be some exploration into how the newly revealed reality affected
their
psyches.   But that doesn't happen here.  Instead, we are given a movie
where the emphasis is placed upon stocking up on as many guns and other
weapons as possible so that the bad guys can be shot and killed.   Give me
a
break!!!<br /><br />I think what has happened in these type of movies is that the producers
are
handed a great idea and then spend their entire budget on the actors and
special effects.  They don't bother to spend anything on the screenplay
because they have realized that good ones aren't necessary anymore.  Just
give the public some nice CGI and they'll flock to the theatre.
Unfortunately, they seem to be right.   Movies like Matrix and and the
Jurassic Park series continue to sell out even though the stories are
horrible.  Give us a cool CGI Dinosaur running around a city or make the
lead characters do CGI kung-fu moves and we'll go home happy.   Never mind
that we have absolutely no insight into who the main characters are.  We
don't need to care about them as long as they are involved in computerized
situations!   (Did anyone actually give a damn whether Jeff Goldblum's
character lived or died in Lost World?)<br /><br />Anyway - my point is that you can certainly make a film exploring ideas
and
concepts similar to those in these mega movies and still have the audience
care about the characters.<br /><br />In the case of Matrix, for those interested in a good
&quot;reality-as-you-know-it&quot;
type of movie, I would suggest Josef Rusnak's 'Thirteenth Floor' or even
better yet, if you can handle sub-titles, Alejandro Amenabar's &quot;Open Your
Eyes&quot;.   Both of these movies manage to give you an incredible story, with
characters you will remember long after the credits have rolled.  Believe
it
or not, you'll actually find yourself wondering about the characters'
futures rather than simply commenting on how cool that CGI generated
flip-in-the-air was.<br /><br />Good movies are supposed to leave you with questions. They are supposed to
make you think.  You didn't really have to do that with Matrix, and its a
shame because the movie could and should have been so much more than it
ended up being.<br /><br />In my opinion, Matrix was a waste of both time and money.  I will just
keep
praying that one day the movie going public will give up on these special
effects monsters and turn back to the days of enjoying movies with plots.
On that day, films like &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; will finally get their due and
Hollywood will stop giving us mere eye candy like Matrix and similar
ilk.
