This was hugely popular when it came out and remains an influential
film. The subsequent sequels may have been a letdown but &#39;The Matrix&#39;
still remains enjoyable. Keanu Reeves is surprisingly effective.
Lawrence Fishburne has a great role and makes the best of it. The USP
of this film remains the Special Effects. They still impress. The story
is classic Sci-fi and is a fairly straightforward dystopia despite a
convoluted beginning. There&#39;s some pseudo scientific dialog but it is
interesting, unlike the sequels where it bores. Hugo Weaving makes a
memorable villain. Recommended.<br /><br />Overall 8/10
