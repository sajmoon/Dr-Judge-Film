I mean, really, WHAT CAN I SAY???  How can words describe it?  Maybe Neo
put
it best:  Woah.  When I first saw the trailers, my first thought was &quot;Who
are all those people?&quot;  My second thought was &quot;All effects, no plot-line.&quot;
Boy o boy, was I wrong.  Yeah, it had the effects and they were
SPECTACULAR,
but it also had one h*** of a plot.  It is my type of film.  I can't give
out
too much info, or else it wouldn't be nice for anyone else.  I just have
one
message to you all:  THERE IS NO SPOON.
