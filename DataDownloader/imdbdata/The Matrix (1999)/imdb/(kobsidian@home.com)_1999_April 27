1999_April 27 

I think this film presents a fantastic, top-notch, classic sci-fi premise.
The truth about the Matrix and how it unfolds is, to me, the strength of
this film. It doesn't fully explain itself and leaves one with a lot of
questions, especially about the relationship between the different
realities, and why actions in one affect the other as they do. But I don't
think that these gaps ruin the integrity of the concept. What DOES spoil
this integrity is the needless overloading of one's suspension of
disbelief.
Was it really necessary, and did it further the story in any way to
include
an unexplained resurrection? Or to allow the destruction of the ship to go
on for so long while it's crew and equipment remain totally undisturbed?
These are only two of the many instances where, apparently because someone
thinks it ADDS to the suspense and excitement, a gripping situation is
over-played to the point where it becomes too much work to keep trying to
buy into it.
The special effects are incredible. The look of the movie is strong. The
cast is up to the job, even stone-faced Keanu.
My only other gripe is the usual excess of bullets, and of violence that
has
no effect. I would think that it was obvious to film-makers now,
especially
after Private Ryan, that the way to make your movie violence effective is
to
give each and every &quot;movie bullet&quot; the action and effect of a real bullet.
The choreography is nice, but the pounding music, the cascade of cartridge
shells, and the piles of bodies becomes both numbing and boring after a
very
short while. Is there anyone out there who didn't find the scene on the
roof, where Neo dodges a total of maybe a dozen bullets, much more
exhilarating and interesting than the carnage in the lobby, where enough
bullets were fired to arm South Central L.A. for a year??!!
