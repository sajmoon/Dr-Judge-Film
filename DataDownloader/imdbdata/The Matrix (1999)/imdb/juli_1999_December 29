1999_December 29 

On first viewing, this film wowed me with it's effects and eye candy
(Keanu
Reeves).  After repeated viewing (I'm heavily into eye candy) I have
become
more and more impressed with the acting (and voice) of Laurence Fishburn.
There are several places that the combination of LF's voice, acting and
the
camera work just stop me cold.  Those are the parts I will remember long
after I have moved on to the next/future favorite movie.<br /><br />I have a copy of the wide screen collectors version with shorts at the end
explaining how some of the effects were achieved.  Knowing how the effects
were produced has done nothing to reduce the 'sensawonda' I feel when
watching the film.
