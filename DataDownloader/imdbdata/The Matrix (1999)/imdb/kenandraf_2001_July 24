This great movie continues the challenge to movie makers to get out of
typical Hollywood formulas and use current movie talent and technology to
place on screen the same kind of magic that sci-fi writers have done for
comic books.Compared to the incredible philosophical/technological stories
that have been done in sci-fi literature during the last hundred years or
so,the Matrix's highly praised story is very plain!This is due to how much
more catching up the movie industry has yet to do in comparison with the
great sci-fi literature that has accumulated over the years,waiting to be
visualised thru movie magic like Star Wars,Star Trek,Superman,The
Terminator,2001,Alien,Bladerunner etc..Yes we have these great sci-fi movie
greats at hand but they are still rare.Becouse of this rarity,movies like
THe Matrix get so much praise.It is a resut of the movie fans demand for
more quality sci-fi movie literature such as this.We do not have to be stuck
with the same old literature for movies where in we will have to do with
Star Wars part 10 or Alien part 8.The abundance of great sci-fi stories are
out there,waiting to be turned into great movies.The Matrix was made and it
delivered.A great comic book that makes us think and entertains us.It even
entertains the ones who don't really think too much,like the people who just
look at the comic book pictures.Sci-fi movie making 101......
