1999_June 18 

This is a movie that does contain some religious allegory, but it is not
overt, and I don't feel that it intrudes on my own beliefs.  The basic
idea
of humans forced into an inhuman existence by their own creations is not a
new one. (remember Terminator?)  Matrix just puts a more creative slant on
the idea.  What makes this movie work for me is the basic idea that human
beings can still triumph against inhuman/machine creations despite
overwhelming odds and a deceptive reality.  The main character is young,
handsome, and intelligent. This introduces an element of romance into the
story, and that makes it even more exciting. I like the fact that he is
willing to be a part of a team, even though he obviously is &quot;The One&quot; .
Also, the comic book aspect of the movie enables you to suspend reality
and
emerse yourself in the story.  Lastly, I like the technical slant.  The
idea
of someone being able to manipulate a program with their mind is
irresistible!<br /><br />
