1999_April 29 

This movie is the best movie I have seen so far in 1999. Keanu Reeves is a
master when it comes to action. This movie as some of the best visual
graphic I have ever seen. It has a lot of talented young stars like
Carrie-Ann Moss, who just plain kick butt.  Laurence Fishburne is also
excellent in the amazing sci-fi action film. I can't what to get it in my
home library.
