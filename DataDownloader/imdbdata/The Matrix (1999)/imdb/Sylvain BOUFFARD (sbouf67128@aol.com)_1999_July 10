1999_July 10 

I just saw the film two weeks ago, and I must agree that it is a major
film,
that deserves all the good critics I have read. What are the qualities of
The Matrix ?<br /><br />The subject itself is interesting and the directors managed to make the
story both complex and captivating. I think that this film really shows
what
science fiction can be at its best.<br /><br />And of course, the film is highly spectacular. The action sequences are
very
well-made, and there is an excellent use of the special effects, as they
really serve the script, making us enter an incredible but finally
believable world.<br /><br />In brief, thanks to the Wachowski Brothers for this clever action flick. I
would give the film between 8 and 9 out of 10.
