1999_April 4 

I went into this movie upon the high recommendation of my friends.  I
thought I was going to be disappointed but I was far from it.  This movie is
a breakthrough in technology.  The visuals are simply staggering.  It is
about time we were given a good sci-fi/action movie.<br /><br />I give this movie a high recommendation to all of those out there who want
to be blown away.  Ironically, one of the trailers was for Star Wars...this
film may give it a run for its money.  It's THAT good.
