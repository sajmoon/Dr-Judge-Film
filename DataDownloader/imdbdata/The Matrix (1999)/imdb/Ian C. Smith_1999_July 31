1999_July 31 

Yes, an enjoyable film and likely one that will likely prove influential for
the sci-fi genre, but I'm concerned at all the wild adulation this film
gets.<br /><br />I thought THE MATRIX was a very manipulative film, and that the stunts
(incredible as they were)and fx swamped the story. It could have been a
wonderful exercise in paranoia, a Philip K. Dick kind of tale, but instead
the film-makers opted for the Jerry Bruckheimer school of storytelling;
there's nothing really wrong with that but I just thought the film had the
opportunity to be something more, and I'm puzzled that this film's ratings
don't reflect that.<br /><br />Many films now just seem to be demonstration reels for cgi and there should
be more to sci-fi films than that. I don't think that people will be raving
about this film in ten, fifteen years or so in the same way as they do about
BLADE RUNNER now, a film many viewers seem to think is inferior to THE
MATRIX. Time will tell.
