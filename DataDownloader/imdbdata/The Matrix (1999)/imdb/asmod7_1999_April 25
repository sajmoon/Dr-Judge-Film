When I went to see The Matrix, I thought it was just going to be another
effects movie.  I was right, and I was wrong:  this was THE effects movie!
At least around here effects movies are not expected to have much in the way
of story or characters, but the Matrix avoided both by introducing an edgy
plot and some pretty decent characters.  I agree that while Keanu is not an
incredible actor, he does have a good look and style, which actually worked
well.  Laurence Fishburne was excellent, as always, and well casted.  Last
comment:  I took my girlfriend to see this movie, and she actually got
motion sick!  says something about the effects, in my opinion.
