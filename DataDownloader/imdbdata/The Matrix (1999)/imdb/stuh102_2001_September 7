This film could be one of the greatest films ever made the Wachowski
Brothers almost acheived perfection with this film. The only problem with
this film is Keanu Reeves he apears almost to be wooden he doesn't show
enthusiasm towards the role but this is a minor problem which can be put
asside because of the truly superb plot and the continiuous action
sequences
which keep you on the edge of your seat and the great acting which the rest
of the cast are able to accomplish. An unmissable film!!
