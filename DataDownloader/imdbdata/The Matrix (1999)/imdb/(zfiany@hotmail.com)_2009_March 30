I find it strange that most of the people who watched Matrix were only
attracted by the visual effects and overlooked the scientific facts on
which this movie was based.<br /><br />People enjoyed the flying mostly and hence liked Matrix 1 more than
they did with 2 and 3 although the answer was in part 3 that is who
will win the war eventually between humans and machines. Some people
they make fun of the idea that one day humans will be in direct war
with machines but those people have not read yet about the Nano
technology. The latter technology offers something like the software
which teaches Neo how to fight in little time. Well through Nano, they
will be able to plant a brainlike chip which works 10,000 times faster
than our brain and they are now trying to optimize the speed limit in a
way that doesn&#39;t endanger our brain which might be burnt working under
such speed.<br /><br />As for the flying part, it is very possible if the science of
Psychokinesis is given more consideration and in the near future I
reckon they will with the evolution of human body which is going toward
less and less movement. Has anyone seen the prototype of the new cars
which have no pedals and we use sticks to drive and direct the car in
different directions.<br /><br />Well, I guess the movie has tackled all these scientific aspects
alongside psychological and philosophical ones in a very brilliant way
and I 100% give this move 20 on a scale out of 10!
