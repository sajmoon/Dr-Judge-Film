After so many dreary, campy, B grade sci-fi movies, I am so thankful that
the Wachowski brothers came out with The Matrix.  It is a futuristic
cyber-thriller that is smart, sophisticated, stylish, dark, and moody.  The
cutting-edge visual effects are awesome!  The
story is gripping!  The pacing flawless!  The acting excellent! Whoa.<br /><br />See it!  It's the best thing since Blade Runner.  The Wachowski brothers are
the ones to watch!
