As many may know already, this movie is absolutely 
incredible. Sure the special effects are great, the sound
track rocks, and the martial arts are the best, but what really 
sets this movie apart is the plot. I'm a practitioner of 
Buddhist meditation and this movie is like a metaphor for
life. In a way, we are all asleep in the matrix of our own 
minds. Few actually wake up to 'reality'. The 'reality' of the 
matrix is a dark one, compared to the brilliance of the 
buddhist path to 'reality'. Nonetheless, this movie is the 
best movie I have seen since Baraka.
