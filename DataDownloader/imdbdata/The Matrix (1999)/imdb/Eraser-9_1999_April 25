1999_April 25 

Not much to say really, Great F/X. Great acting from Laurence Fishburne.
Too
bad Keanu Reeves had to be in it though, but he does it ok really. I guess
it is just those of us who still remember him ruining a perfectly good
short
story like Johnny Nmemonic. Damn I don't like that guy. But the movie is
the
greatest. And the story... Talk about the perfect plot.
