Well it seems that people either really love this movie or really hate it.
Who is right?  Go see it for yourself and decide.  I would submit this to
those who hate it - some people love opera and others hate it, but their
hatred doesn't diminish opera as a legitimate art form.  Just because some
people aren't able to appreciate something, doesn't devalue the object.
This movie does have many good points beyond just special effects. Just
because some people can't understand them or refuse to accept the ideas
presented, doesn't make this a bad film.  There is a strong story with
philosophical messages about faith, love, and the nature of reality.  The
story parallels Christianity so closely that it is almost blasphemous. The
Matrix does have similarities to movies like Terminator and Dark City, but
this movie twists those elements into a different direction that works
rather well.  In the Phantom Menace, the special effects overwhelm the
movie, but here they support the story instead of dominate it, as special
effects are supposed to do.  People who hate this film say that it is full
of plot holes and bad acting.  I found very few holes, and they were
insignificant to the story.  Don't be fooled by reviews of those who
didn't
fully understand the story.  The acting is adequate to make the story
work.
This isn't The English Patient, after all.  Keanu is his usual self, but
it
was tolerable.  He does say his trademark &quot;whoa&quot; once.  As much as I loved
the movie, I will admit that there are flaws with the film.  I hated the
one
scene with the big shoot out in the lobby.  It was unnecessary and
overdone.
It didn't enhance the story one bit, and it didn't even look that good.
I
was annoyed.  But there was so much else in the film that was outstanding,
I
was able to forgive it.
