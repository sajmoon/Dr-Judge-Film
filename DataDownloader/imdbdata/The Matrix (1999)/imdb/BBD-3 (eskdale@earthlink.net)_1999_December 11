1999_December 11 

This is such a fast-moving movie that important details
tend
to be overlooked on the first viewing.  It made much more
sense
and I picked up a lot of the details necessary to understand this film on
the second viewing.  It was certainly worth the time however.  Usually the
viewer has some inkling of the reality in the film, even if the actors
don't, but this movie keeps the viewers in the dark sometimes--thrilling,
frustrating
and even confusing the viewer.  An interesting effect, at some points I
wondered whether the actors were in the matrix or not, kept me on the edge
of my seat.  One only needs to mention in passing the special effects--they
are superb.  Watch this one a few times before passing judgment on
it.
