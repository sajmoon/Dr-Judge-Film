1999_May 5 

The Matrix was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and I see
a
lot of movies.  It was a thinking man's action movie.  The combination of
brains (plotlines, dialogue, etc.) and action (Hong Kong style sequences
with intense camera work) mesh seductively to enthrall the viewer into the
world of the Matrix.  The special effects were phenomenal, making this
movie
a must see for just about anybody.  The critics like to give Keanu Reeves
a
hard time, but this was HIS role, fit to a tee.  As the movie ended, I
found
I wanted more.  Neo (Keanu's character) best summed up my reaction:
&quot;Whoa!&quot;
