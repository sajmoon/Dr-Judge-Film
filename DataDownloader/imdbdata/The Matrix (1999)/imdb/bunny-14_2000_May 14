What a ride. I wasn't sure what to expect but this movie grabs you and 
doesn't let go. Keanu Reeves is a much better actor that he is given credit
for and it shows here. I was amazed when I looked at my watch and saw how
much time had past, it didn't feel that way at all.<br /><br />I can hardly wait for the next installment - just hope it will be as good as
the first.
