The Matrix may very well be the worst film I have ever seen. Terrible
effects, writing, acting, and story make this into the years biggest flop.<br /><br />Now...those of you who have seen the Matrix know that I am either crazy,
blind, or lying for saying these things and obviously I must be. The Matrix
is spectacular in every way.  If you haven't seen it, see it soon. If you
have, then you know what you'll be missing if you don't.
