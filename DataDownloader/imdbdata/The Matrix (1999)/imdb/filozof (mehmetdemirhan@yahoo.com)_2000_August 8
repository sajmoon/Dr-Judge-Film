Technically &quot;The Matrix&quot; is a happy marriage of Hollywood and Hong Kong
movie techniques. The effects are wonderful and successfully makes a total
impact of amazement: it conquers the audience taking into a compelling
imaginative world. You really feel that your sense of reality is forced.<br /><br />On the other hand, just in accordance with the polysemy of the word
&quot;Matrix&quot;, the script is open to multiple decoding. Personally I think that
there is a great examination of religious ideas and mythology behind the
script. I regard &quot;The Matrix&quot; as a postmodern expression of the new
millennial messianism in a mixture of Hong Kong movie technique, Hollywood
presentation, perfect cast and acting, and Jewish Kabbala...Hey these
snobbish words dont mean a criticism. My vote for The Matrix: Simply one
of
the best sci-fi ever...
