2001_January 25 

The ratings on this film are way overblown!  Excellent special effects, a
bench mark for sure.  Yet in all other aspects of film, this movie is far
from the litany of 8s,9s, and 10s it is receiving. Sure I bought the DVD as
soon as I left the theater but people, 2001 ASO, Alien, Blade Runner, etc.
those are 8-10.  This movie is little more than a 7 on special effects
steroids.
