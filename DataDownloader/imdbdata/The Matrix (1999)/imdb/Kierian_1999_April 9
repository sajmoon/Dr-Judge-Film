1999_April 9 

In a year that is destined to be the best of the 90's for Science Fiction
this film will rival the upcoming Phantom Menace.  God I love Star Wars but
damned if I'm not so sure that Mr. Lucas has got the best Sci Fi flick this
year.  He's got some competition from this flick.  I'm sure Star Wars will
smoke everything but until then Matrix is filling up the holes ever so
nicely.  I saw the film 3 times so far and it's still opening week.  First
time in my life that I've ever seen a movie more than once in the theatre.
I've also heard rumors to the effect that &quot;The Matrix&quot; is the beginning of a
trilogy.  Sci Fi returns with a bang and none too soon.
