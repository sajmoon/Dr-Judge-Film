Whatever you say about other Sci-fi movies (e.g Star Wars,E.T)The
Matrix shows the real side to Science fiction with the Story being set
in a different world where everything real is the opposite to on the
real world and the one question which was on my mind and many others is
What is the matrix and how can you tell the difference?<br /><br />Anyway the film is Outstanding and the Wachowski Brothers have done
something that not hardly any director could do.With its fighting
scenes in awesome style with plus amazing special effects this has to
be classified has the first Movie to use cool effects and bring out
positive results. Keaunu Reaves as Neo,Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus
and Hugo Weaving as agent Smith were all ten out of ten because of
their costumes they wore,their amazing fight scenes(especially at the
end between Neo and Agent Smith),and of course the way they all acted.<br /><br />What ever you say about The Matrix you must say that if its either the
best film you&#39;ve seen or at least one of the best films you&#39;ve seen.
