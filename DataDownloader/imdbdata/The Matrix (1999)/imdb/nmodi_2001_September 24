Everyone else talks about the mind-blowing special effects and the wooden
acting of Keanu (whoa..) but I'd like to address the issue of conspiracy
theories.<br /><br />I see this film as a wonderfully constructed and well-thought-out conspiracy
theory about the &quot;reality&quot; that we live in.  Everything from the nature of
&quot;deja-vu&quot; to the fact that a lot of stuff tastes like chicken, is a
wonderfully comical attempt to explain our world.  Plus, the more serious
stuff about bringing Neo's &quot;real&quot; body up to strength, since really, he had
never used it before, brings a sense of realism to the
theory.<br /><br />While most movies these days are so full of logic gaps, The Matrix seems to
have thought about its theory and left very little open-ended.  After all,
good Science Fiction is about the &quot;what-if&quot; question of the nature of
humanity and technology, etc.  Good Science Fiction only works if the
proposed future is proven to be feasible and at least somewhat
realistic.<br /><br />Finally, I did not write this comment.  It was my &quot;residual self-image&quot; that
did.  Whoa...
