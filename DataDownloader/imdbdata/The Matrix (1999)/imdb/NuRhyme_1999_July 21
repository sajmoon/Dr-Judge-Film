Look...I'll make this brief.  If you haven't seen The Matrix by now, then
you've missed it my friend.  You should check your local listings and find
a
screen that's showing it right now!  This is by far the VERY BEST sci-fi
film I've seen in quite awhile.  Visually, this film is a work of art.  The
plot is excellent and the acting is solid.  I was on the edge of my seat
several times while watching this suspensful thriller! How many times has a
movie been hyped-up so much until it's impossible to live up to all the
accolades?  Well The Matrix delivers bigtime!  So please...Believe the
hype!
I wouldn't be surprised to see a series spawned from this one!
