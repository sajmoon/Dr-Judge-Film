The Matrix clearly defined the year of 1999. It was grim, it was witty (at
some parts) and it was ambitious. Wachowski brothers sure put a great deal
of time to concentrate on absolutely every shot. Notice the green-filled
rooms with the dark clothes of the cast. Everything is in a pure harmony,
however dark it is, it is beautiful. Not to mention the incredibly sharp
and
&quot;right-in-place sound effects. When you watch The Matrix, make sure you
turn
your attention to the echoes and reverb added to almost every single line,
also listen for the ambience effects! Overall, this is one of the best
films
ever. And I do not speak only in terms of technical masterpiece. The Matrix
has a deep plot, and strong dialogues. Actually, the only flop in the film
is Carrie-Anne Moss' performance. Although it is not weak by any means, it
could have been better. Yet, this is truly a magnificent film, which is
best
enjoyed on a big screen system with 6+ channel digital receiver, and is
best
viewed...alone!
