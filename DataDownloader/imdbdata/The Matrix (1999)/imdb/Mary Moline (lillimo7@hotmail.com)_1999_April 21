1999_April 21 

I loved this film. I've seen it twice already and plan to go see it again.
It redeemed Keanu Reeves for most of the crappy movies he has done. The
action and fight scenes in it were beautifully shot and the music in it
totally added to the affect of the film. The woman who played Trinity
(Carrie-Anne Moss)kicked some major butt in this movie. I was blown
away!!
