The Wachowski brothers are probably some of the best film writer / directors
out there today. Like most folks, The Matrix's visuals blew me away. YOU
MUST SEE THIS FILM ON THE BIG SCREEN. But what was even more impressive was
the super-tight story, effective use of mythology, empathetic main
character, compelling obstacle character and horrific antagonist. Before I
saw this film I thought THE ROCK with Nick Cage and Sean Connery was the
best action film with real substance behind it.  The Matrix definitely
deserves a top spot on the Top 250 list. See this film! I don't know anyone
who hasn't been impressed with it. If these brothers can keep writing like
this they are destined for long-term film maker fame.  If you end up liking
this film, see BOUND, also by the brothers Wachowski, with Gina Gershon and
Jennifer Tilly.
