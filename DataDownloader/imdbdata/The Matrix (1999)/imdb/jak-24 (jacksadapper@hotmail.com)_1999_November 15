I only got to see &quot;the matrix&quot; once at the cinema, and how I regret it. I
am
going to get this the minute it is released, the action sequences and
special effects are breath taking. The whole idea of the movie is
brilliant,
combined with the script and the immaculate detail make &quot;The matrix&quot; easily
one of the best movies ever made. It is absolutly stunning, and anyone who
writes it off should be put in a straight jacket and stuck in a mental
home.
Stunningly amazing is an understatement.
