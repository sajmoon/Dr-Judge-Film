1999_April 5 

I must admit that I was a bit dubious about this one, since there have been
so many horrendous computer/AI films in the past, but I was actually quite
pleasantly surprised.  The Matrix is a truly entertaining film, with nice
attention paid to internal plot consistency, as well as an impressive
selection of special effects.  Fans of anime-style action scenes should
definitely tune in for this one, it's right up your alley.<br /><br />On a semi-related note, I'm reminded of the series of computer-scare movies
that started decades ago when the technology was still in its infancy.
Suddenly it seemed Hollywood couldn't get enough of the &quot;do we really know
what we're getting into?&quot; theme.  Every once in a while, there's a new
scare, as we make more and more progress in computer-related fields.  Now we
have the Internet, Web, and continuing attempts at Artificial Intelligence
stirring up those fun anxieties all over again.  Seems to be a topic that
just keeps coming back.  But then, they say there are only 5-10 storylines
anyway, and everything out there is just a rehashing of various
combinations...<br /><br />Despite the fact that this storyline is similar, as most are, to many that
have come before it, the premise is still a well-structured and intriguing
one.  Nicely conceived and executed, I must say.  The Matrix may not be high
drama or Best-Picture material, but it's still fun, exciting, and even
(gasp!) thought-provoking.  Enjoy it for what it is, you won't be
disappointed...
