1999_September 29 

As much as I would like to say The Matrix is movie that I can suggest to
all
of you, I can't. Now, if you are only into special effect and action
sequences that defy all laws of gravity, then disregard everything I am
about to say. On the other hand, if you are interested in an good all
around
film, keep looking. This film wishes it was half as good as the extremely
underrated Dark City. This film wishes it were deep, hence all of the not
too subtle reference to Alice in Wonderland. This film wishes it had
clever
writers who did not come off as stealing every mediocre idea from much
better sci-fi flicks. Finally, (and most of all) this film wishes that
Keanu
Reeves could act his way out of a paper bag. Unfortunately, none of these
wishes came true and The Matrix is a third-rate sci-fi film with
extra-ordinary special effects. It just goes to show that style can not
substitute for substance.
