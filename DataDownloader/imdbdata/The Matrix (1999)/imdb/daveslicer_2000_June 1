The Matrix takes us on a journey that would probably be considered one of
the most original,exciting sci-fi action films to smash it's way into
theaters since Blade Runner which I consider a cult sci-fi classic.We are
never given any dissapointment or never bored.The entire film is a nonstop
rocket which we are tied up on that never stops,and that's only the first
twenty minutes.Then it keeps getting better.Keanu Reeves is Neo.A man who
learns what reality really is.Laurence Fishburne delivers a great
performance as Morpheous and Hugo Weaving makes one hell of a villain.Let's
not forget Carrie Ann Moss who can kick butt with the best of them.The
Matrix is the kind of movie that reminds us one thing:HAVE A GOOD TIME.With
time going past us,we don't know when our time will be up.The Matrix is that
movie that gives sci-fi fans a great time.I enjoyed this film and I think it
will always be remembered as one of the best.Word has it that JET LI might
be in The Matrix2.THE MATRIX RULES!!!!!!!
