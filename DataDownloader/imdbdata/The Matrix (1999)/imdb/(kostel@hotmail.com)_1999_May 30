The Matrix is far different than any other Keanu Reeves movie.  It is a
tantalizing flood of new age science fiction wrapped in unbelievable
computer graphics.  Directed by the little known Wachowski Brothers, The
Matrix brings back the love of sci-fi to the silver screen.  You might be
scared off by the idea that this film may be a cop off of recent Reeves
bust
Johnny Neumonic.  But the movie is far from what should be expected.<br /><br />Set in the present, in a big city, a computer hacker named Neo(Keanu
Reeves)
is approached by rebels who offer to answer Neo's most prized question:
What
is the matrix?  The leader of the rebel cause is Morpheus(Laurence
Fishburne)  who is an outstanding criminal of society.  Neo finds himself
in
danger when Morpheus sends fellow rebel Trinity(Carrie-Anne Moss) to
collect
Neo and bring him to Morpheus.  They think Neo is the savior of their
rebel
cause, which is to destroy the matrix.  In this world of reality Neo is
thrust into the world of the rebels, one of mind-boggling truth and
discount
of all natural laws known to man.  If you thought computer programs were
just for computers, this film believes otherwise.
The Matrix strives to be more than a plain movie with great special
effects.
It coherently meshes the story with the computer graphics so everything
undoubtedly seems fluid-like and flawless.  It has such deep meaning that
the film makes you think about how far our society can go into the future
at
its present course.  The idea of a savior for the 21st Century from what
man
has created is heavy.  For example, in the film Agents Smith(Hugo
Weaving),
Brown(Paul Goddard I), and Jones(Robert Taylor II)  shoot to kill Neo who
uses his powers to stop the bullets in mid-air.  This idea would look
silly
if for not the concrete plot to back up the superb graphics.  Keanu Reeves
actually puts in a great performace for this film.  As Neo, Keanu is not
any
recognizable character portrayed in past movies, i.e. Speed.<br /><br />The Matrix is right on as a new age sci-fi film.  I can not emphasize
enough to go see this movie for special effects as well as the plot.  The
whole idea of having the viewers' perception of reality changed and put in
loco to achieve a place where those superb graphics feel real makes the
film
work.  Other than one weak plot scene where Neo is brought back by a kiss,
The Matrix was the best.<br /><br />
