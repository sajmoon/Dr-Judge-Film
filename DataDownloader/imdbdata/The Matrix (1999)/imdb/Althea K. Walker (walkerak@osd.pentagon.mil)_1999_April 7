1999_April 7 

The movie was wonderful...read all of the wonderful comments (ignore those
comments from the folks who didn't get it or just don't like to be
entertained).  But I really need to speak on Laurence Fishburne's powerful
performance!  I do not expect any less of him, based on most of his other
character portrayals.    He is definitely the force behind the strength of
the message of the movie.  The supporting cast had extremely good
chemistry
going.  This was a great adventure into the past, present, and future all
at
the same time.  Thanks for the memories (i.e., Bruce Lee, Superman, Snow
White(reversed)).  Thanks for the eye candy.  Thanks for the philosophical
stimulation.  Thanks for 'The Matrix'.  Can we go back there sometime?  I
hope so.
