1999_August 9 

Science-fiction is an art form, whether you write it or make a movie based
on it.
2001, 2010, Star Wars, Blade Runner, Alien, Dark City: all these are
examples of the finest art in the movie industry. Now I add to this small
list The Matrix.<br /><br />The Matrix&acute;s Plot is complex and equally simple. It envolves you right
from the beginning. You (the viewer), get hints in a sparingly way, just
as
in the best Octavia Butler&acute;s sci-fi novels. The exposition, both visual
and
verbal, is stunningly well done. It shines as a rare case of equilibrium
between the need to inform and the need to capture the spectator&acute;s
attention.<br /><br />Now, all this should be enough to make it a good movie. But there is
more:
the fighting scenes, the special effects, the sound effects, the
soundtrack...and the acting.
The Brothers got it right, whatever the angle from which you look at the
movie. It&acute;s non-stop action together with a intelligent
storyline.<br /><br />The fighting scenes were beautifully choreographed, and the camera&acute;s
movement and positioning, following hints from japanese anime, is vivid
and
dramatic.
For instance, helped by the camera and special effects wizards, Carrie
Ann&acute;s movements were simply fantastic, all the more if you consider the
fact
that she was once a model. Technological wizardry and personal physical
accomplishment well merged.<br /><br />You will see some magnificent visual effects, but the sound effects
surely
top those by more than a notch or two. The Brothers could have followed a
Devlin-Emmerich (ID4) type of philosophy - bigger, louder, etc -, but they
refrained from that...well, there&acute;s only one scene where they wrecked the
balance sound-action-music ... I&acute;ll leave it to you to discover what scene
I&acute;m referring to.<br /><br />The soundtrack is almost hypnotic, it helps the plot along, it kind of
makes the characters move forward, builds their emotions...and also ours.
Some movies alienate the viewer with some too agressive music and
instrumentation, but The Matrix&acute;s soundtrack is perfect, made
to-the-point.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves and the rest of the cast...well, two words for them all:
great acting. There is not a single moment in the whole movie where you
think to yourself: &quot;0h, weak, fragile acting as usual...&quot; Everybody, from
mr. Reeves to Ray Anthony Parker, knows their place and what they are
supposed to do exactly to the millimeter. They convince us that they(the
characters) are real.<br /><br />If you think of Blade Runner&acute;s action and environment, or Dark City&acute;s
storyline and atmosphere, you think of dense and coherent facts, not
flashy
or shocking to the point of nausea (like ID4 or Aliens IV), but solid and
attention graber...that&acute;s the case with The Matrix.
While scary, The Matrix&acute;s universe is an epic and brave one.<br /><br />The Matrix: intelligent, thought-provoking, exciting, vivid, innovative
and dramatic film-making.
You&acute;ll love it. I did.
