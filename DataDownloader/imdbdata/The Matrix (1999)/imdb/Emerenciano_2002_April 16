&quot;Matrix&quot; is certainly different from anything else you have ever seen
before. Full of surprises and action, the plot gets your attention from the
beginning to the end of the film. <br /><br />Wachowski Brothers greatly directed this movie with an enchanting creativity
that made &quot;Matrix&quot; an innovating film, full of incredible sounds and visual
effects. <br /><br />Keanu Reeves is Neo, a hacker who is invited by Morpheus (Laurence
Fishburne) to discover what Matrix is. Curious about it, he accepts the
invitation and enters a world of pure action and adventure. Beautiful
Carrie-Ann Moss plays Trinity, who helps Neo out in his discovery.<br /><br />Wanna know what &quot;matrix&quot; is? Sit back and enjoy it!<br /><br />My rate 9/10<br /><br />
