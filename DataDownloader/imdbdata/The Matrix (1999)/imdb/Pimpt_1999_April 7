1999_April 7 

After seeing the first trailer for this film I wanted to see it the day it
came out. So far twice. Is this world just a false reality?? Or are we
just
mindless drones looking for a way out that does not exsist. This movie
starts out with a mind blowing scene with Trinity, who then goes on to
demonstrate her ability to jump higher, run
faster and escape from anything out there. If I go on then there will be
no
purpose for you to see the movie. Once again this movie was the best I've
seen this year, the f/x only made the plot more belivable.
