OK, so the special effects were really good, and the gun battle scenes
were
cool. But as for the story line, it was a good concept, but in my opinion
they failed to make it even half as good as they could have...I was rather
disappointed after all the hype. I'm glad I saw it at a friend's on DVD
instead of paying for it at the theater
