The Matrix has a very complicated plot and can be hard to understand at
first but it makes up for everything with its very unique effects.  This
has
got to be the BEST sci-fi movie so far this year!  What I really like
about
it is that it gets me thinking about what if WE have a matrix too.  What
if
we are all sleeping right now?  Great movie.
