The story of this thing is more a rip off of Virtuosity, Star Wars,
Hideaway
and every other &quot;chosen one&quot; flick. The dialogue is pretty corny as well,
&quot;he
is the one&quot;, the acting is fine for what the actors are given, Morpheas is
laughable with all his oooh aaah knowledge and the way he comes up with
extremely complicated answers to simple questions, how complicated is the
matrix concept, all of humanity is plugged in to a giant computer that
pulls
a digital world over our eyes to use us as batteries, let me know when it
gets complicated.<br /><br />Reeves does not do a bad job at all, he suits the role and he is never
unbelievable in the digital world he has to act against, and nobody save
Schwarzeneggar can wear sunnies and leather like he does. At the theatre
this would have been one of the greatest experiences, I saw alot of movies
at the theatre in 99 but this was not one of them unfortunately. Overall
this really is not a bad movie for entertainment, it is very definitely a
teen flick formula but it can work for other people as well. The effects
dont
really seem to dominate the movie, there is only 5 or 6 points where they
are used to the max, and there is only 3 or 4 where that multicamera trick
is used, the effects basically just help you to believe that there are two
worlds.<br /><br />Getting plugged into a computer that makes you believe it is reality and
having to rescue someone inside that and the possibility that being killed
in the computer can kill you in reality are all Virtuosity, as for a
messiah
taking a young and unsuspecting boy off to train for the time when he must
save the galaxy from a dominating empire I dont think I need to say where
that formula has come before. You really aren't quite so analytical when
your watching it.<br /><br />In short, the effects, the characters and acting and the story are all
pretty good, and this a movie to note, it is not run of the mill, its also
watchable more than once. Overall its worth seeing at least once so do
yourself a favour.
