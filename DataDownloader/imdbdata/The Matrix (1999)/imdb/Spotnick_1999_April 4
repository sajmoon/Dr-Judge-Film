1999_April 4 

I just came back from the movie, and the only feeling I have is... &quot;Wow&quot;..
was that great!<br /><br />I went to see the movie with only the TV publicity in mind and a good
comment from a friend, but I didn't really know what the movie was about.
That did it all, I didn't know at all what was going to happen and I was
pleasantly surprised for 2h and more.<br /><br />I have to be honest, I had the last Keanu Reeves' sci-fi movie in mind
(Johnny Mnemonic) so that almost stopped me from going.. believe me, it's
two worlds!<br /><br />This was one of the most original city I've seen. The only movie which is
close to this in terms of feeling would be the movie &quot;Dark City&quot; (1998), but
that one is far superior.<br /><br />I am recommending this movie to all people who likes to be surprised in a
movie, and do like a little sci-fi, even if this is NOT the main attract to
the movie.<br /><br />Laurence Fishburn is good as usual, and Keanu Reeves is like he's
always.<br /><br />Go see it and you won't be disappointed.
