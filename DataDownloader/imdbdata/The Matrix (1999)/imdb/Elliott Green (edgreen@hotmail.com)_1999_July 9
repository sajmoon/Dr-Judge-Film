1999_July 9 

A rare example of great special effects, a seriously fascinating concept,
and a well executed plot all in one, The Matrix is far and away the best
film of the year so far.  After three viewings I feel that I can grasp the
majority of the themes presented in the film, but I'm sure I'd pick up on
more upon a fourth viewing.  Many of these themes have already been
expressed in other of these reviews, but some have not (although I haven't
read all 1000+ of them):<br /><br />Fate: at first I didn't understand what the Oracle had to do with the
plot -
it seemed to be a mythological/religious reference that detracted from the
Christian theme running through the film.  I eventually realized that the
presence of the Oracle raises the question of fate, or more accurately,
whose reading of fate we should trust, i.e. that determined by the
machines
or that determined by the Oracle.  The Matrix is a computer program and
thus, given all of the facts, the future, or fate, can be determined.  We
are not inclined to believe that about the real world, given Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle, etc., but Morpheus and the Oracle suggest that fate
works here as well.  If both worlds are controlled by fate and thus
deterministic, then what is the difference between them?  If the actions
of
the rebels in the real world are predictable like a computer program, then
why could not a computer program be written to describe the real world as
well?<br /><br />Mind: the agents attempt to &quot;hack&quot; into Morpheus' mind, much &quot;like a
computer&quot; as Trinity says.  So what is the difference between his mind and
a
computer?  In fact, the film treats the mind much like a computer - i.e.
&quot;uploading&quot; martial arts training into Neo's mind and entering the Matrix
(&quot;downloading&quot; your mind?).<br /><br />Music: the techno music played in the film again raises the question of
the
difference between man and machine - if this music is completely produced
on
a synthesizer/computer, then what makes it human?  I may be incorrect, but
I
only recall hearing the techno music in the Matrix scenes, not the real
world scenes.  [Sidepoint: why does the music on the soundtrack have to be
inevitably different from the music played in the film?  This really
disappointed me, and it's not the first time either - check out Moby's
&quot;God
moving over the face of the waters&quot; in the film &quot;Heat&quot; and on the
soundtrack.]<br /><br />Anyway, with a couple of exceptions (Keanu Reeves' acting, the way he
&quot;saw&quot;
the Matrix at the end of the film) this is a truly great film.  It's
better
than either Terminator film and sits right up there with Metropolis, Star
Wars, Blade Runner, or 2001 as the greatest sci-fi films of all time.
What
makes all of these films great is that they come up with an interesting
concept, have an enjoyable plot and great special effects, and give you a
lot to think about when the film is over (which is where the Terminator
films fail, the second to a lesser extent).   If this film gets nominated
for Best Picture it will restore my faith in Hollywood.  See
it.
