What is 'The Matrix'?  Well part of that you have to find out for yourself,
but the other part I can tell you.  'The Matrix' is, by far, the best Sci-Fi
movie in the last 15 years.  Do you remember the feeling you had while
watching George Lucas's 'Star War'?  If you do, then that is the feeling you
get when watching 'The Matrix'.<br /><br />'The Matrix' is a film concept by the Wachowski Bros.  Right from the start
you are blown away.  The special effects immediately grab you.  As does the
martial arts fighting.  But, the exception to this is that 'The Matrix'
doesn't take the fighting or effects overboard.  Right when you think the
battle will never end, the film gos right back into the story of discovery.
Even the story, by itself, is enough to keep you watching.  And, right when
the movie slows down, it speeds right back up again.  This movie is contrast
used in perfect form.<br /><br />The stars themselves are an eyeful.  Keanu Reeves plays Neo, the chosen.  To
be honest, I have never really liked Reeves.  I never thought he had the
talent to be a great actor, and, although his acting isn't perfect, he does
play the part perfectly.  Laurence Fishburne plays Morpheus, Neo's guide
into the world of 'The Matrix'.  I have always loved Fishburne.  He is smart
and plays the knowledgeable leader perfectly.  Carrie-Anne Moss plays
Trinity.  Her character, at first glance, is not that important, but, as the
movie goes on, you understand just how vital she is to the story.  One more
character to point out is Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith.  He is as menacing as
he is dark, and that is saying a lot.<br /><br />I won't dwell on this too long, but I must say that this movie is almost
revolutionary in a sense.  I don't want to tell you the plot, and to go on
and on about the effects would be boring.  But, what you must know, is that
'The Matrix' is perfect from start to finish.  You will not want it to end.
You will want to go back for more.  What is 'The Matrix', you ask...Well as
in the words of Morpheus, &quot;No one can be told what the Matrix is, you have
to see it for yourself.&quot;
