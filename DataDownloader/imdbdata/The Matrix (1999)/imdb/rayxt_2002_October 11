Somebody says, &quot;What a mindjob&quot;. It is. And it would have been a lot funnier
if a computer simulated reincarnation of Ed Wood had directed it with a cast
of freaks. Perfect, however, for our brave new virtual reality world. Long.
Boring. Heads and those searching higher planes of consciousness with
'mescalito' should keep a finger on fast forward. Reality might be too much
to bare.
