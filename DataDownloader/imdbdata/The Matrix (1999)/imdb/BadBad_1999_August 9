1999_August 9 

This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time!  The effects were
great!  The plot was (Ah!) Original.  Yes.  And, of course, everyone loves
seeing the good guys run around beating up the bad guys while dressing
fashionably.  I just enjoy watching them do things that regular people can't
do.  I can't wait to buy it.
