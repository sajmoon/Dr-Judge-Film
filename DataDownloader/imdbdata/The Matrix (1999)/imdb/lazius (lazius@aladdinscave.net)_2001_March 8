2001_March 8 

Well, i don't know about you but it seems that this movie has been
carefully put together.
Sure they are faults, but which movie hasn't ? I do agree with
those that say that there are holes in the plot and that
sometimes the graphics aren't as worthy as they should be, and
that.....well.. .....Mr Reaves needs perhaps to take a few acting
classes.
To be honest, its a decent film enough to go out and see, it is
an experience like none other, its unique in its genre. Also its one
of the first times that such a story has been constructed so I think it
is time to give all those who worked on it a little credit and
appreciation.
What i was really intrigued about , however, and probably the
main reason i went to see it twice, was that people say that art
reflects life, and one could say that is true as without art, culture
might have evolved the way it has in our everyday popular
culture.
I think its very brave of someone who thinks that the future could
distort in such a way.
Already we know that the internet is growing on us and that it is
true, we are part of the digital age, that can be seen specially in
The Lawnmower man 1 where at the end of the movie when the
phones begin to ring.
What was fascinating in the Matrix, was how the director(or
perhaps the writer), took that idea of living in a virtual world even a
step further . It wasn't a virtual world that Neo ended up but the real
one, therefore the director tackled even all the laws of gravity as we
know them. The question might be, are we naive enough to
believe in the message he is trying to portray? or are we too
ignorant and perhaps arrogant to understand what true reality
really is?
Watch the matrix, good or bad, u might just simply enjoy
it.
