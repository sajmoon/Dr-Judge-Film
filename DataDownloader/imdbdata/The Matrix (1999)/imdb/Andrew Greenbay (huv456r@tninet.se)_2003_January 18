I have to say that I've loved this movie from the first time I saw it, and
I've seen it several times. But, the last time I saw it, a few days ago, I
actually liked it even more(don't know how that happens). I really thought
about the script, and realized that it's truly magnificent. The movie is
so
incredibly original. I might nowadays be tired of the &quot;Matrix-effects&quot;
that
appears in almost every single action movie made nowadays, but you have to
remember that it was Matrix that started these beautiful
&quot;freeze-sequences&quot;
and that everybody loved them, otherwise they wouldn't have been imitated
by
so many other movies. And the best thing of all in this movie is the
&quot;WHAT!!
HOW INCREDIBLY SMART!!!&quot;-scenes when you realize what the Matrix really
is.
I mean nobody could ever guess what the Matrix was until you were shown.
For
those of you who's seen it, you've got to admit you were stunned when you
saw what the matrix really was.
If you take some time to think about it, it seems like a thing that
actually
can occur in the future. The movie is really fast paced, and sometimes it
gets a little too much. It's almost too &quot;cool&quot; but I mean they wanted to
make a comic-like cool movie and really succeeded in those aspects, though
for some people it just gets too much. Anyways it's a stunning movie, and
I'd even advice it to those who dislike action-movies because the Matrix
is
very well written, and it's based on a very interesting thought the
Wachowski-brothers came up with. Mostly for the originality I'll give it
9/10. Can't really tell if I think it's a masterpiece or not, but It's
certainly not far from it.
