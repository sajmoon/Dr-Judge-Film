1999_July 6 

One of the best films I have ever seen.<br /><br />I will be totally honest with you.  I didn't know what to expect when I
came
to see this movie.  It looked interesting from the previews and movie
trailers I saw.  However, it really didn't hit as being a excellent film
until I saw it.  Now I can't get enough of it.<br /><br />The plot is one of the most interesting I have ever seen and the fight
scenes are probably going to be voted as the best ever filmed.  Sure,
there
was a few corny parts to the movie, like the love interest they threw in.
However, that does not detract from how good this movie
is.<br /><br />If you see one movie this summer....go see the Matrix.<br /><br />10 out of 10
