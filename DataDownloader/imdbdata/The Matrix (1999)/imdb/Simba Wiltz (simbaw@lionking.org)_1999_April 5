What is reality? This question has perplexed philosophers for years and
years and now we finally have an answer in The Matrix. This action/sci-fi
film combines the best aspects of action with a psychological and
philosophical edge sharp enough to cut through the fabric of reality into
another dimension. Cutting edge special effects make this movie all the more
ethereal, pulling the audience into a world we never knew or imagined.
Definitely a must see. The only downer is that the movie is another shot at
a humanity that will destroy itself with technology. Nonetheless, go see the
movie! You'll never look at the world in the same way again.
