The Wachowski brothers follow up their excellent neo-noir film Bound with
this visually amazing cyberpunk action flick.  I can't believe this is
only
the second movie these guys have made.  The Wachowskis wisely retained
several team members from Bound, including cinematographer Bill Pope,
composer Don Davis, editor Zach Staenberg, and actor Joe Pantoliano (here
in
a smaller role than Bound).  Keanu Reeves isn't as annoying as he tends to
be, and pulls off his fight scenes surprisingly well.  All the actors do,
thanks to rigorous training by legendary Hong Kong action director Yuen
Woo-Ping.  I've always said that American action directors should take a
lesson from their Hong Kong counterparts, possibly the best directors of
action on the planet.  Hugo Weaving is a great villain, I think the only
other movies I've seen that he was involved with are Babe and the unfairly
ignored Babe: Pig In The City (he did voice work for both, only briefly in
the latter), but I'm already a fan.<br /><br />The film takes it's story from many disparate elements, including crime
films, cyberpunk fiction, Japanese anime, and kung fu movies, all of which
are things I like.  The stylistic influence of directors such as John Woo,
Tsui Hark, Mamoru Oshii, and others are evident in many
scenes.<br /><br />The cinematography by Bill Pope is also excellent, as usual.  Wheras Bound
had a great film noir-style &quot;b&amp;w in color&quot; look, everything in the Matrix
seems to have a sickly green computerish color, as if everything is shot
under fluorescent light.<br /><br />In some ways, the story makes me think a lot of the story of Bound, both
are
about a journey to freedom, and the majority of the film being set either
in
the Nebuchanezzar or The Matrix reminds me of Bound being set mostly in
two
rooms.  With only two films under their belts, the Wachowski brothers are
already a major talent to watch for, I eagerly await their upcoming Matrix
prequel and sequel (I wonder which is going to be made first).
