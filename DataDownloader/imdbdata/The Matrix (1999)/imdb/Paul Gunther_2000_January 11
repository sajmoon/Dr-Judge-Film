A lot of people are going to think this film is original, which is
unfortunate, because it's not. It doesn't have anything new to say that
hasn't been said going back to Fritz Lang's silent classic &quot;Metropolis&quot;. It
also takes itself way too seriously for a film that is really little more
than eye candy and popcorn.<br /><br />Its effects have been done before but just on this scale, which the film
should be commended for. However, the film feels like it was made with the
story servicing the effects and not the effects servicing the film. It's
like they had this idea for a really cool effect and figured out a story to
write around it. That combined with the fact that it can't decide if you
wants to be a pretentious drama or an action movie ultimately bogs the film
down under its own weight.<br /><br />Recommended for people that like mindless action only; for people that think
Lethal Weapon originated the buddy cop film and not The French
Connection.
