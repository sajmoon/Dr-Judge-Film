1999_April 6 

Okay, I just saw this movie and I must admit that it was somewhat
confusing
at first, but that's because my attention was being focused on the two
idiots sitting behind me.  Anyway, if one were to pay attention to this
movie (which is what I recommend), one would notice that there was basic
philosophy in this movie.  And many people who like philosophy, like me,
would absolutely love this movie. However, I did notice the similarity
towards the end of the movie with one of Keanu Reeves' earlier movies
&quot;Little Buddha&quot;.  But I won't say what it is because I wouldn't want to
spoil the end for you. Anyway, I would recommend it if you are one of the
people who likes to come out of the theater with an expression of
disbelief...it's worth it.
