1999_April 5 

As many others have written, this is simply an awesome film, combining
high-intensity action, spectacular graphics, and lots-o-cool with a real,
meaningful plot.<br /><br />As I examine obvious and subtle aspects, it becomes clear that The Matrix is
an artistic-liberty retelling of the Gospel (i.e. The Bible, chapters
Matthew, Mark, Luke &amp; John). From the character names (Trinity, Neo [new
man], etc.), the plot (this world is not fully real; arrival and actions of
a messiah), to even the title (&quot;matrix&quot; is an old-english term used in the
Old Testament for &quot;womb&quot;), this spectacular cybertale is grounded in the old
and still-relevant central story of scripture.<br /><br />Also interesting is that this is the third film (alongside The Truman Show
and Dark City) in a year that feature our hero discovering he lives within a
false reality, and struggles to escape. Even better is that all three films
are excellent.
