If you're a SciFi VR enthusiast, DON'T miss this movie! It's got everything
you'll want: great story line, excellent special effects, wonderfully
developed characters, and an ending that will both satisfy and leave you
wanting more. If you enjoy this sort of thing, be sure and read Jack L.
Chalker's three book series &quot;The Wonderland Gambit&quot; and Robert Charrette's
&quot;ShadowRun&quot; books. A great deal of the story in this movie was lifted from
these books; all are excellent SciFi and drama.
