1999_July 21 

This one got everything: an awesome cast, good director's to handle the
film
and a plot that really makes you wonder of what's going on in the film (and
in this world;-)). When I first saw the trailer, I thought &quot;Oh, once again
one of these popcorn-boom-boom-actioneers&quot;. I was wrong. All pictures from
the trailer appeared within the last 20-30 mins; the &quot;rest&quot; of the movie
was
pretty quite instead. And that is exactly what this movie makes so good: It
is not the typical &quot;Hero-saves-world&quot;-stuff; it is the story, the plot that
catches you and takes you deeper and deeper into this topic that our
reality
might be a perfect illusion. When I attended school we had the issue of
&quot;What is considered to be real&quot; in our philosophy-lessons and it really
sucked. This movie offers a way to follow the ideas it shows.<br /><br />So on the one hand you have a disturbing and scaring plot and on the other
hand you have techniques of making films that offer you a view into the
next
millenium. I have never seen so beautiful pictures, none have I seen so
cool
special fx (Bullet Time) or such a perfect green-screen
keying.
There are not many movies that I've seen twice; this one I saw five times
(until now)...
