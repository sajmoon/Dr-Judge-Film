I really enjoyed this movie. The special effects were dazzling and the
martial arts moves like the flipping and the jumps, although not entirely
realistic, were awesome. I also enjoyed watching Keanu Reeves and thought
he
did an excellent job in this movie. In the next one he should have longer
hair for the whole movie, though because he looks better like that then
when
it's very short.
