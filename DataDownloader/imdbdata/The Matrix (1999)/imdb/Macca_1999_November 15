1999_November 15 

What can be said about the Matrix.  It was recommended to me, heavily, by my
best mate, after he had basked in all it's glory, so I was tempted to go and
see it, and by the next day I was sat in my seat, with my popcorn and coke,
raring to go.<br /><br />I had read in several magazines and newspaper reviews that this film was
gonna be good, and boy were they right.<br /><br />I practically chocked on my own drool as I observed some of the most
breathe-taking effects ever, (well, except the Phantom Menace) and sweated
over one of the most interesting and original plots I'd seen in a long time.<br /><br />Keanu was wicked, in surely his best performance since Speed, and Laurence
Fishbourne was perfect as Morpheous.  The rest of the cast did there part,
well, and kept me enthralled so much that I forgot about my popcorn (well,
for about 40 minutes).<br /><br />The pumping soundtrack, incredible graphics, effects, acting and storyline
have made this one of the most popular films in a long time, and I, and I'm
sure you too, cannot wait for the next two installments of the matrix...<br /><br />And as for the question &quot;What is the matrix?&quot;  I will tell you that it is
one of the best sci-fi films ever, so go and enjoy it, now...!<br /><br />Rating, 10 out of 10, of course!!
