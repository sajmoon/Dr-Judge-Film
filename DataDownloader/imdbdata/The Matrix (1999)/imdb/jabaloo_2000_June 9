I think I know the reason why so many people liked so much The Matrix. It
brought science fiction to the masses. I mean real science fiction, not
ID4
or whatever. The regular movie goer does not have a mind open enough for
the
possibilities and unconventional thinking that science fiction provokes.
But
if it is dressed up with cool special effects and wardrobe and the plot is
naive and well explained enough to be understood by all, then everyone
will
think that the movie has changed the way they think about the world, and
all
that nonsense. That's about all I have to say about The
Matrix.
