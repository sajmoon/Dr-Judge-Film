1999_September 25 

I can understand how the Matrix was so successful. With lots of gun shots
and explosions per minute, good special effects, stylish actors and a few
solid sci-fi ideas what more could you ask for?<br /><br />Let's begin with some original plot ideas. My problem I guess is that I have
seen a lot of sci-fi movies and TV shows. So, basic plot retreads do not
excite me. The beginning of The Matrix starts out like Scanners (1981)
introducing people who have incredible powers. Then it shifts to the virtual
reality, world is illusion, phase (done at least 50 times on the various
Star Trek series and Virtuosity, 1995; Strange Days, 1995, etc.). Then comes
the machines take over humanity surprise (Star Trek First Contact-the Borg
and Terminator 2). The rebels in the Matrix are looking for a Messianic
leader (check out the original Terminator). <br /><br />How about showing some original style? I recommend Dark City (1998) which
accomplishes this very well. The Matrix is a blend of Blade (1998) and
Terminator 2. We have acrobatic actors firing machine guns in slow motion,
big deal. <br /><br />Does the plot make sense? Sometimes, but it is very inconsistent. The idea
that the machine/bad guys would fight with guns in the virtual reality world
is absurd. This is a computer controlled reality after all of the 22nd
century. Why limit yourself to clunky guns? <br /><br />How about some decent dialogue? The love interest in this film is a joke.
Trinity's (Carrie-Anne Moss) lines at the end of the film are terrible. You
want an excellent heroine? Try Linda Hamilton in the Terminator films. 
Between the posing and posturing and the fight scenes what is being said by
the crew most of the time is pretty lame. You want to see good scenes of a
crew under pressure? Try the first two Alien movies.<br /><br />What is there to like about The Matrix? The editing, sound, camera work,
stunts and computer graphics are good. Lawrence Fishburne turns in a fine
performance as usual. Also, all of the action and special effects are able
to cover for Keanu Reeves who turns in a flat performance as usual. Briefly,
in the middle of the film when the pace slowed in a scene with the &quot;oracle&quot;
the characters and plot became a bit more interesting. But then it was lock
and load time.<br /><br />What really bothers me about The Matrix is that this mediocre retread is
rated higher by imdb members than these great films; Blade Runner (1982),
Alien (1979), Aliens (1986) and Terminator 2 which is outrageous. The Matrix
does not belong in the top 200 movies. This will take care of itself in a
few years because this oracle predicts that by 2010 hardly anybody will care
about this film.
