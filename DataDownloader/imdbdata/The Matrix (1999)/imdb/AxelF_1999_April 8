1999_April 8 

Although some of the ideas in the Matrix are borrowed roughly from other
movies, it is still very original and has the story line, acting and visual
effects to keep almost any viewer hooked. This is one of the best sci-fi
movies to come out in recent times. I was most impressed with the
performance by Carrie-Ann Moss as Trinity.
