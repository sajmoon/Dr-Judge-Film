1999_April 9 

No, I am not quoting from a famous writer, that is what I feel! I should
have been getting bored of watching movies because I saw &quot;Out of Sight&quot; on
Friday, &quot;Reefer Madness&quot; on Saturday, &quot;EdTV&quot; on Sunday, &quot;8MM&quot; on Monday,
&quot;Lord of Illusions&quot; on Tuesday, and this movie on Wednesday.  After a line
up like that, generally I would be getting bored of movies, but I loved this
movie.  This movie held my attention all the way through its 2 hours+<br /><br />Plot:  I cannot explain it.  &quot;You'll have to see it for yourself.&quot;  The
concept is strange, and I liked it.  It explains a lot.  I could just barely
follow the plot as the movie was flying by at breakneck speed (although the
plot wasn't).  It is complicated, so pay attention.  If you like
mind-numbing movies, wait for summer action flix to come
out.<br /><br />Acting:  It was decent.  I mean, Keanu Reeves sucks as an actor, but
Fishburne rocks.  He is one of the hottest actors of current cinema.  Don't
miss &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot;  The actress is good, but good looking too.  Man was
she hot in her clothes.  You can surpass the acting for the rest of the
movie though.<br /><br />Action and Effects:Outstanding.  Easily the best effects for a long time.
The bullets, and the staging were great.  The choreographed action scenes
looked like they were from John Woo. The effects were all over the place.
This is one of the movies where the actors don't take the back seat to the
effects.  They actually work with them, and it seems to work.  The action
sequences were many, and it was great.  Definitely see this movie in the
theater because of the effects, and sound, and because it is
wide-widescreen.  (It has a 2.33:1 ratio, whereas with formatted movies,
they cut off the sides to make it 1.33:1. That is 3/7 or almost half of the
screen.)<br /><br />The music is awesome techno; metal; rock and roll.  I will definitely buy
the soundtrack.  Stay for credits when Marilyn Manson's &quot;Rock Is Dead&quot; is
played through movie theater-quality speakers.  Perfection.<br /><br />Do not miss this movie in theaters.  It is one of the best action movies
since &quot;Face-off,&quot; and one of the best sci-fi flicks ever, esp. since
&quot;Alien.&quot;  I give this movie a nine because it had some hokiness, and
cliches, but all movie so anyways.------------9
