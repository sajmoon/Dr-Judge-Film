1999_April 26 

Eye-popping visual effects make a fairly good plot line into a pretty good
movie!  I hate Keanu, but after having heard about the
visual effects in this movie, I had to go see for myself.  I found myself
looking around the theater during the action sequences, and seeing the faces
of the crowd in disbelief as the dork from Bill &amp; Ted's becomes somehow hip
in this movie.  From the beautifully choreographed fighting to the millions
of chips of materials flying around each and every bullet, this picture is
worth the cost of admission.
