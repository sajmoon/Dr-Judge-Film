&quot;The Matrix&quot; is definitely not Unbelievable. It could have been allot
better, but, not even better enough to be Unbelievable.<br /><br />The only thing I liked was the ending, which reminded of the ending of &quot;The
Transformers: The Movie&quot;. I couldn't understand what Fishburne was talking
about, he kept saying something about &quot;Real is real, real can't real, but
real real real...&quot;, get what I mean. And Reeves' acting sucked. And the
script was horrible.<br /><br />&quot;The Matrix&quot; is an action movie tangled with special effects and confusing
scientific plots.
