1999_April 19 

I had very high expectations going into this film,  The Matrix blew them
away!  It's as if they knew exactly what I would think was cool and made a
film for MY viewing pleasure! I loved nearly every aspect of this film!  The
Kung Fu fight scenes were some of the best I've ever seen (and I've seen a
lot)!  Beautiful use of slow motion and sound effects.  Fantastic
cinematography!  I can't wait to see what the Wachowski brothers next
project will be.  A thoroughly enjoyable movie experience!
