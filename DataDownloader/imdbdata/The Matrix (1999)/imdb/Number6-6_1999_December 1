1999_December 1 

The Matrix is not a perfect movie.  I thought the religious symbolism was a
little amateurish and I didn't really buy into the evil robots using
humanity as a power source plot.  And if Morpeus said &quot;He is the One!&quot; once
more I would have walked out of the theatre.<br /><br />However, despite these flaws The Matrix is easily one of the best action
films of recent years.  It accomplishes this mainly by style.  The Brothers
Wachowski live up to the promise of Bound and prove that they see things in
an atypical way.  Every frame of the Matrix is saturated with their own
unique vision and style.  This makes the Matrix a good cut above the
manufactured and overly processed studio entries over the past few years
(from Wild Wild West to the horrible End of Days).  Audiences are tired with
convention and the success of the Matrix is proof of that.<br /><br />And, of course, the Matrix features the best kung-fu choreography outside of
Hong Kong.  The Brothers Wachowski really know how to make a fight scene
look good with nice flowing camerawork and numerous long shots.  I, for one,
like to know what's happening in my action scenes--enough of that rapid
editing and those idiotic extreme close-ups!<br /><br />
