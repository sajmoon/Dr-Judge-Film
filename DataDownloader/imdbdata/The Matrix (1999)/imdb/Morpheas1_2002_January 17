What is Matrix? `Matrix is everywhere, is around us. Is the world they
have
build front of your eyes to caver the truth'
The truth is this: Technical intelligent it's a fact, the machines have
identity and they have won the war with humans. The world is destroying
and
the mankind lives in a digital universe. One rebel group, with his leader
Morpheus, battled for liberation, save Neo, a hacker who may be the
Messiah
and saver of human race. They uncover the truth to him.<br /><br />That what is following is a basic elements mixed from sci-fi movies,
cyberpunk literature and comic culture. `Alice in Wonderland' meets Holly
Bible and cyber grunge shift to religiously experience. The thinking is
more
then the action in Matrix. It seems that Wachowski brothers have work out
they resources before they make this impressive storm of special effects
and
intension. Implicate Zen with virtual reality and the storm of shooting
with
violent flying choreography from Hong Kong, it seems that they invent the
action movie from scratch.
Special effects are not be used to make the explosions look more
impressive,
but to build a world from the beginning. They twist the reality, not with
unreal way, but extremely believable.
Even if the action scenes, from the frenzied chase in the roofs at the
beginning until the shoot out at the end are breathtaking, Matrix doesn't
exist only for that reason. The style triumphed, the attraction reminds us
video games, but the story raise smart questions for thinking and contain
an
impressive number of ideas. Every detail has not only knowledge and
resource, but also fantasy and particularity.
Matrix is the `Blade Runner' for the new generation. It has only one
`weakness'; it put the ell to high for the coming movies.<br /><br />
