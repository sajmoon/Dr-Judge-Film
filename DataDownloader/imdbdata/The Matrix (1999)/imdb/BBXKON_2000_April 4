_The Matrix_ isn't just a good-looking cyber-thriller.  It is also unique
filmmaking.  The Wachowski brothers have invented a style of sci-fi/action
that will change how directors tell stories and choose shots for years to
come.  If anything, see this movie and be absolutely blown away by how
perfectly it is put together.  It actually won four Academy Awards, and
deservedly so!<br /><br />Much has been said about the story and symbolism of this movie.  The most
important theme in the movie, in my opinion, is the idea that an
individual's free mind can and should determine their reality rather than
the oppressive, external forces that try to control it. <br /><br />Overall, the film maintains this idea without being boring.  The acting is
surprisingly good, and the action sequences are original and dynamic.
