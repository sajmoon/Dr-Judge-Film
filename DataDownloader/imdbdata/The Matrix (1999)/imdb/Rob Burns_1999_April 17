1999_April 17 

As movie making in general goes, I can't recommend this movie for
everyone. The dialogue was spotty at times, and the second act dragged on
a
bit. Plus there was a certain predictability and some corny moments. The
idea of &quot;The Matrix&quot; is a plausible one,though, and feeds a bit on modern
anxieties associated with our existence.
For those who like &quot;date&quot; movies, tear-jerkers, and the like, this
may
not be your sort of film. However. If you enjoy action and/or
sci-fi...this
movie's got it! If you can stomach the first six minutes, you're ready for
the rest of the rollercoaster.
Keanu Reeves does a good job in an understated role, and Laurence
Fishburne is excellent. I did have problems with focusing on Joe
Pantoliano
a bit too much. He does a good job, but the subject matter demanded that
less time be spent on his machinations. Hugo Weaving was great! Put the
man
up for best supporting actor! It was great fun to watch him be the bad
guy.
The rest of the cast did well also.
Between the 3D-imaging, effects, rock-em sock-em stunts, likeability
of
the leads, pacing, and music score...The Matrix Rox!!
