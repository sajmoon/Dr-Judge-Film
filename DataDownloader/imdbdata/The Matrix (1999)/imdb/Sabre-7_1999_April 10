1999_April 10 

This movie totally blew me away.  As a big fan of Sci-Fi, action, and
martial arts I was totally stunned to see such an excellent composition of
these three styles in the one movie and done so well.  Add the excellent
storyline to this and you've got an absolute winner.  The makers of this
movie drew from influences such as John Woo and Ridley Scott - two of my
favourite directors.  The excellent use of slow motion added immensely to
the feel of the action and the suspense, and the digital effects were used
to the perfect level of &quot;augment&quot; the story, not &quot;overcome&quot; the
story.<br /><br />My new favourite cult flick!
