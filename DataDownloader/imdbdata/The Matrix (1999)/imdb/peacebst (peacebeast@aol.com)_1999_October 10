1999_October 10 

I have not been so childishly drawn into a movie since Star Wars.  The
innocent, playful, comic book style of the film covers it's heavy themes
beautifully.  The notion of the willingness to see truth as an indicator
of
morality was purposefully portrayed as the Hero is willing to witness the
truth regardless of the consequences, while his Judas-like human enemy
takes
the path of least resistance and opts for pleasure over truth.
Thankfully,
these motifs never become heavy-handed and the film rock'n'rolls along
nicely with spectacular violence and special effects.  I have seen the
movie
in French and German and still found it entertaining.  My favorite movie
of
the year.
