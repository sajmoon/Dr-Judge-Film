1999_October 19 

Clearly, some people disagree with me, but while this movie was certainly
entertaining, I didn't think it was great.  It had it's moments, but all in
all, I've seen better movies.  <br /><br />The one thing all my friends kept telling me: &quot;The Matrix has a great plot&quot;
I think it's a sign of the kind of brainless movies being released this days
that when any movie with a sniffing of a plot comes out, people
automatically take it for the next &quot;Godfather&quot;.  The same thing happened
with &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;.  The plot here is passable, but far from
excellent.<br /><br />There are two parts of this movie that were really excellent.  Once is the
mind-bending special effects, which were extremely well-done.  The other is
Laurence Fishburne, who is at his best as &quot;Morpheus&quot;, the leader of this
rag-tag group.  Keanu Reeves does  his best no to overact the part, but it's
really Fishburne that stand out.<br /><br />Would I recommend it?  Sure.  Is it the greatest thing I've ever seen?  Not
by a long, long shot.
