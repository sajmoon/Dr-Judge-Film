Matrix is doing it for it for the millennium as what T2 - Judgement Day did
in for the 90's.<br /><br />First rate effects, I can honestly say that this is the only film strong
enough to rival T2. &quot;James Cameron eat your heart out. You never saw this
one coming&quot;. <br /><br />I first went to the cinema and was caught completely off-guard in terms of
what to expect. . .  Mind - blowing is all I have to say.<br /><br />Load up Matrix 2 tank.
