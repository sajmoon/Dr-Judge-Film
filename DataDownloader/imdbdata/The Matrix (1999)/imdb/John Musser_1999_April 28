1999_April 28 

This movie has a good story (very imaginative sci-fi), great special
effects, and no shortage of fast paced excitement.  If you like
action/science-fiction then Matrix will not let you down.  If you're not too
keen on sci-fi then you might give this one a miss.  I predict it will be
nominated for an Academy Award for Special Effects (and it could win, but
will be up against Star Wars Episode I).  I vote it an 8 (really a 7+), but
I'm a fan of the genre.
