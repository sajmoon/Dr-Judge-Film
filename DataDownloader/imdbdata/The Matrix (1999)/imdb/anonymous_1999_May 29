1999_May 29 

I must admit I went to this movie expecting a lot of special effects with
a
story written by a two year old. How I was shocked. This one actually had
a
story to follow. Not the depth of some films, but very impressive for this
kind of genre.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves (Bill and Ted) is very impressive in this film, but isn't he
always? As for Lawrence Fishburne, well, a superb effort, making his
character the best in the film. Australian Carrie-Anne Moss plays the part
of the plastic wearing (remind you of catwoman???) martial arts babe with
superb acting.<br /><br />What is the Matrix? Well I better not spoil it. But it does remind me of
Lucas' 'the force!'<br /><br />This is a very impressive film, definitely tailor made for the big
screen.<br /><br />Unfortunately the ending is a let down, there seemed to be something
missing
in it. Maybe it finishes a little too abruptly.<br /><br />Some never to be forgotten scenes and some good humor. And no action
mainstream flick is incomplete with the romance. We wait a while, but it
does add something to the film.<br /><br />Around and 7 or 8 out of ten for the Matrix - two marks off for the
ending,
one mark off for the fact that generally i don't like your mainstream
action
'the hero seems to be bullet proof and the bad guys get unlucky kinda
stallone or scharzenneger films!
If I'm nice I might give it an extra mark for the fact that it had a
story!
