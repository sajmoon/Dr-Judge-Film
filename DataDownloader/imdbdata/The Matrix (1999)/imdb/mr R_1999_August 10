1999_August 10 

I consider, that the Matrix is one of the most important movies in the
late
90's. I did really enjoy the story and the visuality. I don't usually like
martial arts in the movies, but this time they were put together with
talent, so they weren't boring.
The movie really got the grip over me in the first minute and held tight
till the very last picture. And as a final pick, the sound track was
fabulous!!!!
I'm only afraid, that parts II and III won't be that
spectacular.......
