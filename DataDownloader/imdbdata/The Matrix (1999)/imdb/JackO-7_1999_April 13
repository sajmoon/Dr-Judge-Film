Wow.  When I walked out of this movie I felt disoriented.  This movie is
amazing.  It really makes you think about reality.  And those fight scenes
would make John Woo jealous.  Although the story may have a couple weak
spots, it is barely noticeable.  I'm going to have to go back for a second
viewing just to get a full view of the plot.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves was good... not great, but he fit the part well.  Everyone else
did great, especially Laurance Fishbourne.<br /><br />The special effects are out of this world.  These have got to win some kind
of award.  Go to this movie if possible, and if you don't like it, go again
and actually WATCH the movie this time, cause it's great!
