1999_April 8 

I'm still recovering from seeing this film five days ago. The Matrix is the
only movie I can honestly say is worth paying seven and a half bucks for. It
went beyond my expectations and not only did the special effects blow me
away (understatement), the whole premise was amazing, clever, and
believable. Every character played their role with perfection and didn't
allow the movie to be just visually satisfying. I'd admire these actors a
great deal for dedicating many months to learning martial arts. What must
have been a very long and difficult experience paid off extremely well, and
each actor should be proud. Overall, I walked out of the theater like I had
just walked off of a rollercoaster; shaken and flabbergasted. If I had to
recommend one film out of the thousands I've seen, it would undoubtedly be
The Matrix. Once you've seen it, your perception of cinema will never be the
same. <br /><br />
