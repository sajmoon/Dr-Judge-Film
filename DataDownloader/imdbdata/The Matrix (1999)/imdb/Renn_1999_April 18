1999_April 18 

I was terrified of a let down as I walked into the stadium seating theater
to see this film.  I was disappointed in a few of the last movies that I
went into with high anticipations for (Dragonheart, Spawn and a few
others).
I was not to be left wanting this time.<br /><br />The Matrix is a ground breaking film with outstanding direction and
cinematography, a sold story and good acting.  Even Keeanu Reeves nay
sayers
shouldn't be able to really pick his performance apart that
badly.<br /><br />This movie will do for the cyber-punk genre what Star Wars did for
Fantasy/Sci-Fi, especially with the rumors floating about that this is the
first in a trilogy.  From start to finish, I was on the edge of my seat,
riveted and throughly entertained.  The last two minutes of the film
wasn't
the strongest ending ever, but after hearing the trilogy rumors, I forgot
my
complaints about that.  This wasn't your typical Hollywood, leave it open
ended for a sequel, it was planned.<br /><br />The Wachowski brothers are the new hot shot directors in the biz.  Between
the independent Bound and now The Matrix, I see an innovative genius in
their work.  They know how to blend classic themes and techniques keeping
everything fresh and exciting.  I rank them with the short list of
directors
that I will draw me to a movie by name alone (Ridley Scott, James Cameron,
David Fincher, Steven Spielberg, Francis Ford Coppela among others on said
list.)<br /><br />Lawrence Fishburn is solid as usual.  He looked like he was having fun
during the filming which will always increase the quality of an actor's
performance.  New comers to big budget features Carrie-Ann Moss and Hugo
Weaving were great.  Moss was far more than just eye candy (though her
patent leather costumes were to die for) and Weaving was truly sinister.
Both should have a bright future in Hollywood.<br /><br />The special effects are top notch.  While I'm sure the Phantom Menace will
amaze even more, the reported 60 million dollar budget makes what they did
in The Matrix just that much more impressive.<br /><br />The Kung-Fu.....  Wow.  The choreography was amazing.  It was very
apparent
of the long hours of training that the actors spent during pre-production.
They made Keanu, Lawrence and Hugo look like they had been doing martial
arts for many years.<br /><br />All in all, one of the best movies I have ever seen and easily the best
movie of recent years.  Not since Braveheart have I seen a film that has
drawn me back for repeat viewings so  many times in its first few weeks of
release.<br /><br />I give it a nine only because tens are ratings that I have only given out
once or twice ever.<br /><br />A MUST SEE for any fan of the genre.
