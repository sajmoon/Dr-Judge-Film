  &quot;The Matrix&quot; is one of the best Science Fiction movies of all time.  It
yields a great plot, characters, and action, as well as a theory about human
existence and life as we know it and implies a warning about the control of
Artificial Intelligence.  This movie was released at the perfect time.  When
it was released in 1999, the world still was frightened of the Y2K problem,
which might have become a problem related to the problem in &quot;The Matrix.&quot; 
Also, Artificial Intelligence was (and still is) just arond the corner,
frightening audiences world wide.  The third reason that it's release was
impeccably timed was that special effects allowed &quot;The Matrix&quot; to become
more than a Sci-Fi/Drama, it became a Big Action/Sci-Fi film with a dramatic
story.
  
  <br /><br />  The way this movie was filmed and directed really made the entire film
worth-while to see.  The special effects, though made in 1998-99, are still
cutting edge.  The camera angles actually show a bullets path as well as a
way to rotate around a great fight scene in slow motion.  The camera angles
were just fabulous and turned &quot;The Matrix&quot; into an even better directed film
than it already was.  Another cool directorial attribute that made the film
even better than it would have been was that most of the color blue, only in
the Matrix not reality, was taken out to make the setting look dismal and
show that the Matrix really was a repressive and depressing
place.<br /><br />  Many questions are raised after seeing this movie.  Although I can't
reveal them now, I can tell you that this movie is worth seeing for maybe
only this reason if you're not big on movies but you are big on philosophy. 
The directors created a wonderful picture that was beautifully directed and
superbly acted.  I can't say enough for this movie, it was just amazing. 
You could see this movie and enjoy it, but I know that you'll do more than
that, you'll see this movie and be amazed.
