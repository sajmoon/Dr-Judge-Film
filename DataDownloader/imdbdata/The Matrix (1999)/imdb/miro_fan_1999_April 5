1999_April 5 

After seeing previews of this film, I knew I would want to see it, just for
the special effects.  But I also thought it would be a horrible film, mostly
because of Keanu starring in it.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Other than a
relatively weak premise, the Matrix delivers astounding visuals, intense
action (great hand-to-hand combat scenes), tasteful to skilled acting, and
(most surprisingly )a thought provoking story-line.  This is one movie that
is best when seen with no previous knowledge.  So go see it. You will
definitely be entertained.
