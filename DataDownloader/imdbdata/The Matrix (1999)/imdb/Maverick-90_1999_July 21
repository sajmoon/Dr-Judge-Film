1999_July 21 

A speed-fuelled, retina-bending sci-fi juggernaught that proves why films
have to seen in a BIG screen. The plot is almost insignificant compared to
the riot of flashy visuals, flo-mo and Zen-lite dialogue but provides a
semi-original concept that the Wachowski brothers exploit to the full.
Keanu
is superbly confused as the hacker seeking a higher meaning to life and
unable to believe he can be the One that Carrie-Ann Moss, Laurence
Fishburne
and crew have been searching for. Hugo Weaving matches them well as the
obsessed Agent/program, leading up to a genuinely inspired face-off finale
with plenty of visual fireworks and striking imagery. Even better the
second
time round, this sets a new standard in the genre and must be giving George
Lucas pause for thought when he starts coming up with his next prequel.<br /><br />
