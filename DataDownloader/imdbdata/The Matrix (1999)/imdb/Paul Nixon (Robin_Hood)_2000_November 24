The Wachowski brothers (Andy and Larry) may seem pretty new to some film
watchers.  However, they were behind the 1996 thriller 'Bound' which was not
a huge success BUT...have you watched it?  Anyway, enough about that, let me
talk about 'The Matrix'.  When Rudyard Kipling wrote the poem 'If' he missed
out the crucial line...<br /><br />&quot;IF you can put up with Keanu Reeves' poor acting ability, you'll love every
film he's in&quot;<br /><br />This is no exception to that rule.  In fact as Reeves plays Neo/Thomas
Anderson, a computer hacker who knows nothing and understands nothing about
'The Matrix' he fits the bill quite perfectly.  He's handsome, has a good
athletic build and a huge following ever since his debut in 'Bill &amp; Ted'. 
Laurence Fishburne on the other hand, as he proves in this movie, is some
kind of screen God.  Again, no-one else could really fit the bill as the
amazing Morpheous.
Some say this film has a slow start.  These people are known as 'impatient'
and obviously do not realise the importance and brilliance behind the early
stages of the film.  9/10 - you've missed it on the big screen which is
where it belonged, but watching it on video won't make that much difference.
 It's still a brilliant film and shot into my top ten from the moment
Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) ran across that roof top in that pvc
suit!
