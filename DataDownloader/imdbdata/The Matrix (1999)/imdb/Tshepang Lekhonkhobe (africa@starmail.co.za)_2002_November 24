<br /><br />Should we call it a sci-fi masterpiece or simply a defining moment in VFX
film-making. I'd prefer the latter for a masterpiece it's not but there's
no
denying that it's among the most influential and exciting of all films
ever.
The cinematography, which is reminiscent of some
unrealistic overblown Oriental films, is really great and so are the VFX
which are among the best ever put on screen. But there has actually been
better action drection. Also the film is also too flashy and looks a bit
empty as if the directors were incapable of portraying
some depth beyond the flashy surface. A critic once said the film is
pseudo-intellectual there's a lot of truth in that statement. To the
uninitiated, the story is totally mind-blowing - a feeling similar to the
Fight Club experience - but once you get used to it you simply
go
on with the excitement movie and start noticing a few weaknesses and then
you realise that what's left is to marvel at the technical genious
involved. 8/10<br /><br />
