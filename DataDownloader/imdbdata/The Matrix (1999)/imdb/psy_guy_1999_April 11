1999_April 11 

This movie may seem similar to many others in the
science fiction genre, but one must take a close look at it
to
appreciate it. The main key is going into this movie
without ANY prior knowledge of what it is all about.
If you &quot;know what the Matrix is,&quot; the movie may seem
a let-down to some. A must see for anyone who
wishes that there is more to this existence than what
we see and experience every day. Keanu Reeves, an
often misunderstood actor, makes a stunningly realistic
reflection of who we all could be. Many who do not
like Mr. Reeves should give this one a try. You will be
surprised. Also, any film worth its weight will have an
excellent soundtrack to go along with it...and this one
takes the cake! Just give it a try and let your mind
expand.
