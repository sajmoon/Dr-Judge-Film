1999_April 23 

Believe me, Keanu Reeves and Lawerance Fishburne don't carry this movie.
It's the special effects that give this flick all its balls.  The previews
got the people interested and then once you were in the theatre to watch it,
the effects kept your eyes glued to the screen.  The Marilyn Manson song
&quot;Rock is Dead&quot; was the featured song in the promo, but was left out of the
movie score.  If you ask me, that song really made that promo and to leave
it out of the movie was a goof.  Overall, &quot;The Matrix&quot; kicked
ass!
