1999_May 15 

This is one of those films that break the mold and define a new school of
film making. Think &quot;2001&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;Alien&quot;. The story
is pretty familiar to most SF aficionados but we'll be seeing this style
of
film making well into the next decade.<br /><br />The story, though recycled, has a very savy post 90's spin to it that
makes
it entertaining as hell to most computer cognisati. Among other things it
rationalizes deja vu as an online program change and reveals the darker
side
of intelligent &quot;agents&quot;. Though it seems to have been dipped once too
often
in the Zen reflecting pool and been filtered through the crash course of
&quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; the story is still entertaining as well
as
worth listening to.<br /><br />So in synopsis, a really cool story with some of the finest film making
art
to come down the pike in a long stretch.
