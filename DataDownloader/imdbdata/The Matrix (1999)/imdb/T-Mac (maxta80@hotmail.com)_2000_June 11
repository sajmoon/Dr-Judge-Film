The Wachowski bros have truly excelled in this brilliant film. The direction
and special effects are incredible but don't take away from the plot or the
acting which is so often the case with this kind of film. All aspects of the
film come together so well, the frightening plot, the awesome special
effects, the insightful direction, the great acting and the gripping
script.<br /><br />Lawrence Fishburne is perfectly cast as the wise leader Morpheus, his
character is always cool and delivers some very memorable quotes (&quot;Fate it
seems, is not without a sense of irony.&quot;) perfectly, every one of his
movements is planned and deliberate.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves proves that he still has some acting ability in his portrayal
of Mr. Anderson, Neo. Being totally out of his depth for the first half of
the movie and then turning into the one who can do it all was very well
done.<br /><br />The Agents also deserve praise for their roles. Hugo Weaving could not have
done better, everything from the monotone voice to the constant menacing
glare was bone chilling. By the end of the film you can really see how much
he hates being in the matrix, being a sheperd to the more primitive
prisoners.<br /><br />From the sunglasses to the boots, the costumes for each and every character
suit the film to a tea. And the sets compliment everything, the interior of
the Nebuchadnezzar especially.<br /><br />Overall a brilliant film that is a must see. One of the few I've given a
10/10.
