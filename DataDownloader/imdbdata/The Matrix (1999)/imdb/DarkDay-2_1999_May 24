1999_May 24 

I thought that this movie was SUPER!<br /><br />Why? Well, first of all, Keanu Reeves is HOT!!! :) I'm not kidding, he's a
TOTAL babe! Plus, a super actor. Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss
are
great too, and did a brillant job of making their characters interesting
and
appealing.<br /><br />But, aside of that, the most important thing is that there was a PLOT. And
we're not just talking about any old piece of junk, the plot was GOOD.<br /><br />Why do I find this amazing, you ask? Well, in most of the action movies
I've
seen, the plot, if there WAS one, sucked (to put it VERY bluntly).<br /><br />Now, perhaps I'm being a bit demanding here, but I like movies to have
good
plots. That way you can really get INTO the story.<br /><br />The best movies are the ones in which you feel as though you are THERE,
with
the characters, experiencing all that's happening. The Matrix did all
this,
and managed to have TONS of action and mind-numbing graphics too.<br /><br />I was amazed that it was possible to cram all this into one movie. It was
SUPER!<br /><br />So, putting together the good plot, loads of action, super graphics, and
an
AMAZING cast (and I'm taklking about the WHOLE cast here, not just Keanu
:)
I think we've got a winner!
