1999_April 20 

I don't like science fiction, or alot of special effects, so I wasn't
expecting to be blown over by The Matrix...and I wasn't. It was decent,
but
nothing I would go see again. I have to figure the trekkies who loved this
movie so much, are the ones who carried it to #20.<br /><br />References to the plot being complicated make me laugh. I can only figure
the majority of posters on here are young. There is nothing complicated,
there is just a good versus bad, messiah to save the world theme...that is
predictable and lame.<br /><br />I'm glad people like this movie so much, but it did nothing for me. Of
course, I'm not a Star Wars fan either.
