The Matrix is a movie that combines a combonation of great actors
and
special effects. The directors are brilliant in this film, i had to see the
movie twice because the rush was so great, the sound track is excellent the
storyline leaves you thinking of all the possibilites of the scenes. Their
are hidden messages inside of the movie hinting at how Neo could be the
one.
The music whats on T.V. what the advertisements are in the backgrounds,
everything. The movie has the best special effects i have ever seen, the
best music, and some of the best acting. This movie rates a 10 on my list,
please watch this movie more than once to pick up all the little things in
the movie, enjoy it once more. See the world that you are living in The
Matrix.
