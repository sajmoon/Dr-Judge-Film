   I had heard NOTHING but excellent reviews about The Matrix. People led me
to believe that this was one of those &quot;11 out of 10's.&quot; It wasn't. Great
Special Effects. Bad Acting. Good Action. Awful Ending. Fine Story. Very
Good Movie. Keanu Reeves still hasn't learned how to act. And UGH! Neither
can Carrie-Anne Moss. Fishburne and Pantoliano are decent but that can't
cancel out the others. Still, originality, excitement, and entertainment
give this an 8/10 from me.
