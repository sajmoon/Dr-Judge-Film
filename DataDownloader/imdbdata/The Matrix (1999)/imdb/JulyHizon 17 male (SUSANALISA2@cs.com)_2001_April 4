2001_April 4 

I almost liked this movie, though the rest of the world liked it way too
much! In either case, it won best visual fx at the academy (i thought
STAR
WARS:EPISODE ONE deserved it) and it won best sound fx (FIGHT CLUB
should've
gotten it without a doubt). The last time i checked, when someone gets
kicked in the rib cage, it does NOT sound like a pillow being wipped with
a
recently used condom!
Anyway, this movie is fairly simple; it is very easy to understand
because everything is repeatedly spelled out for you. As a matter of
fact, I
already knew what the movie was going to be about when i first started
seeing the commercials for it. And it was so predictable, everything i
saw
in that movie, i wasn't surprised i saw it because i knew (after seeing
the
first 10 minutes) that it was going to happen later! Keanu plays an
average
shmuck who works as a cubicle drone. He knows something is missing from
his
life as strange dreams echo to him from the real world. He of course uses
his
computer hacking counterpart named Neo to find an answer. As he gets
closer,
he recieves a myterious cell phone one day while at the office. It rings.
A
mysterious voice starts giving him instructions that would eventually
lead
him to the window ledge 80 stories above the street. To overcome his
fears
and climb down would mean that he is willing to dive into a dark,
dangerous,
and mysterious adventure into the unknown of reality. They should have
made
the rest of the movie the way that window ledge scene was written- MORE
ACTION, LESS YAPPING.
But why is the rest of the movie so slow moving? It treats as like
we're
nine-year-olds! It would've been better if they gave us few hints that we
can use to figure out the theme of the movie. If i were still seven years
old, I would have liked this movie a lot better, but now I'm seventeen
and
i've already gone way deeper down the rabbit hole than this movie has
taken
me.
It's also formulaic- perfectly designed to get rebelious type teens to
empty their wallets at the box office. It is also written based on
marketability rather than art so the movie ends in a visually stunning
shoot
out rather than tying up lose ends or giving a satisfying ending. But
what
disappointed me most was the characters, they're incredibly dull. None of
them caught my fascination and the acting is so weak that when Neo said
&quot;Morpheus was like a father to me&quot;, it wasn't until then that i realized
that he felt this way. If the acting is any good, then we would have
known
that before he said it out loud. Even the Oracle lady was nothing but
useless clutter on the screen.
I GAVE THIS A 6/10
