1999_May 18 

The story has a lot of elements taken from other movies. There is a lot
taken from Terminator, They Live and Nirvana, but the final result is a
really great movie with a non original but still wonderful story. It has
been such a pleasure watching this movie that I am planning to go to see
it
again as soon as possible. I think it's one of the best sci-fi/thriller
movie ever made.
