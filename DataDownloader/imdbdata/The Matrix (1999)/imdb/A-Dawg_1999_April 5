1999_April 5 

Well gee.  I'm not really a fickle person.  I like most of the movies that I
see, and I actually enjoy most movies with Keanu Reeves (woah, it's true).
Still, I was somewhat more excited to see this film more than others.  And
what can I say, two days later, I saw it again.<br /><br />See this film.  Please?<br /><br />It was great.  I can't help but tell everyone that I know that they just
have to see this film!  It was more than just a movie.  It really captured
my imagination, and made me THINK about it over and over until I had no
choice but to see it again just to feed my aching cerebrum.<br /><br />The acting was great.  Reeves and Fishburne made an amazing duo, and all of
the other characters really helped to bring it together, as well.  The
choreography was top notch - those fighting scenes are breathtaking,
especially since you can see that the actors themselves are the ones doing
all the insane punching and kicking.<br /><br />The special effects... whew.  Being someone who wants to go into sfx for a
career, I will usually see any sfx enhanced movie just for that (I actually
enjoyed Godzilla... albeit mildly, and Lost in Space made me drool, as much
as other people seemed to not like it).  The Matrix new exactly what was
needed.  That &quot;time slice&quot; effect seems to be highly overdone as of late,
and whoever invented it is rolling in the dough, but it was really well used
here, and I think added to the story.   I feel that the
characters' abilities to warp reality were shown this way.  The effect made
it seem as though they moved so fast that time had to be slowed so the
audience could see what was happening, or sometimes that the characters
could actually slow time in order to do some of their stunts.  Whatever the
case - I thought it worked.<br /><br />The story was so neat!  When I think about this film in hindsight, it's as
if this film was a REALLY good comic book that was turned into a REALLY good
film.  I could visualize every single scene being re-done into a Todd
McFarlane epic.  I'll bet that something not far from that actually
happens.<br /><br />In the end, if other people react as I do to this film, it will be a big
money maker, probably spawn lots of paraphernalia, goods, more movies, WHO
KNOWS?  It may not top Star Wars (that's a movie that I will camp out to
see), but it sure kept my mouth watering and will keep my brain at ease as I
wait for May 19th.<br /><br />
