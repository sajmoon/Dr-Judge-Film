after seeing this movie in the cinema and renting it on VHS, i own this
movie on DVD and now i watch whenever i want. The good thing about this
brilliant movie is that it gets better and better each time i see it! On
each viewing i discover new interesting details in the special effects and
the story. Sometimes i even put it on pause to glare at the special effects
shots, like when Neo wakes up in the real world. You should try do that too,
only then you can truly observe the visual excellence of these scenes. This
movie totally deserved the oscar for visual effects (sorry phantom menace!).
As Joel Silver said in an interview, this movie is ground-breaking, a film
that will be much imitated by others.
