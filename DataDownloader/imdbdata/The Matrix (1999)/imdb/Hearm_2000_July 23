2000_July 23 

When I first read my norwegian newspaper about the popular
movie about &quot;the reality that's pulled over our eyes&quot; i've
got interested, also because i'm interested in the paranormal
and of course computers.<br /><br />I went to the theater, sat down and the movie started.
After about 30 minutes I realised; this wasn't just an
ordinary action movie, it was much, much more.<br /><br />I've got this &quot;Deja Vu&quot; when i watched that movie.
The thought of me thinking exactly the same as the
writers of the movie did.<br /><br />The action scenes,the fighting scenes,the breathtaking
effects,the taglines, everything about this movie was
extremly well made.<br /><br />But, on the technical side, I just hate one mistake that
was
shoot in the film.
Tha's the scene when Neo and Mr Smith is fighting in the subway rails, when
Neo jumps from the rails, and up to the higher floor level.It was easy to
see the cables he hangs/and holds
himself from.<br /><br />But that the only thing that I dislike with this movie.
And I have no doubt when I say, this is the best movie i've ever seen.And
therefor I bought the DVD version,the VHS version
and a VideoCD version, just to have it in a long time.<br /><br />Brilliant!
