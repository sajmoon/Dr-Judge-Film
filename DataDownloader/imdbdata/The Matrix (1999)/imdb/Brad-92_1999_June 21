Personally, I think that &quot;The Matrix&quot;, is the best movie I have ever seen
till this day.  The surprising thing is that I hate Science Fiction.  I
still loved this movie.  I have been reading other comments and yes, &quot;The
Matrix&quot; has it's flaws, but don't all movies have them!?  Yes, sometimes
the
actors can be kind of dull.  Yes, sometimes the dialogue can be dumb.  And
Yes, the plot can be confusing and weird.  We have to look at both sides
of
the picture.  But the positive aspects of the movie, by far, surpass the
&quot;once-in-a-while&quot; flaw/mistake.  This movie has it all, from &quot;eye-popping&quot;
special effects to unbelievable choreography.  The plot is very
interesting
and catchy.  It makes you think a lot, even though we know none of it's
true.  The costumes are absolutely incredible.  They make the characters
look
sharp, incisive and at the same time hip and cool.  The physical endurance
that the actors had to have was &quot;out of this world&quot; and I applaud to that.
They coped with it even though it was demanding and I think it payed off.
This is a &quot;have-too-see&quot; movie.
