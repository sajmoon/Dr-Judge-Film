What is reality?<br /><br />That's the question you'll ask after the movie ends. It's subtle, down to
the
experiences of deja-vu that we all get from time to time. The Wachowski
Brothers have excelled themselves.<br /><br />Well timed release before Star Wars Episode I gets to the UK means it
doesn't have to compete for audience ratings.<br /><br />Ignore the critics.. go and see it. Then wonder if anything is really
real!
