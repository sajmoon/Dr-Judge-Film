1999_April 11 

As soon as I saw the ad for this film I began counting down the days until
its release. I also managed to catch a two second glance at the web address
on the ad. The page then proceeded to take up all my time up until the film
was released. The webpage was good in not giving away anything, and I highly
recommend the comics based on the Matrix universe, and comments can be
entered in the forum, which has degenerated into a chat session discussing
the movie...<br /><br />That was until I saw the movie - despite the fact that I saw it in a
slightly less than good cinema, even though I tried to get to a good one - I
was blown away, I knew the special effects would be good - but the
Wachowski-dubbed &quot;bullet-time photography&quot; (the slow motion bits - actually
a little more complicated than slo-mo) - was stunning. The storyline had me
hooked from the moment I read about it on the webpage. The only fault of the
movie, and I hate to say there was a fault, was the clich&eacute;-only-way-to-save-the-hero,
which I think could have been replaced with something a lot more
enlightening and inventive. Otherwise I wanted to be part of the Matrix. I
wanted to be in the world, understand the code, _manipulate_ the code.
Superb - I can't wait for the sequel (obviously there will be one). I hope
someone makes an rpg fast.<br /><br />Casting was amazing - especially Lawrence Fishburne (I want his shades!!),
he fits the role right down to his voice - I can't think of a better person to
play the role of Morpheus. Keanu Reeves proves himself to be a good actor
after all, doing a really good job of looking confused - then realising what
is going on around him. All the minor actors are superb, fitting their roles
snugly.<br /><br />Anyway - for anyone who is going to watch this movie - go into it prepared
to think fast - to keep up with the storyline.... if you don't - the agents
will be able to move faster. which will probably result in your dislike of
the film and consequent bad reviews to your friends.<br /><br />10/10/10.
