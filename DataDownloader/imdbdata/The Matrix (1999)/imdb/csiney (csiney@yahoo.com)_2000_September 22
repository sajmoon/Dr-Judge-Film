The Matrix is one of the best films I have ever seen. The special effects
in
this film are out of this world. How somebody came up with this idea is
beyond me. It is the most original film ever. The Matrix won all 4 academy
awards it was nominated. I think that Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne
both deserve an Oscar. This movie should have won best film, best script
and
best director. This movie also has the coolest action scene. In the Lobby.
I
can't wait for the sequels to come out. They could never be as good as the
original though. FIGHT FOR THE FUTURE.
