1999_November 15 

Having rented &quot;The Matrix&quot; in a pay-per-view channel last night,  my first
thought afterwards was why didn't I go see this in the theater. The visual
effects and photography were pretty stunning on my 27-inch TV, they must
have been stunning on the big screen. The best performance in the film was
by far Lawrence Fishburne as Morpheus, Keanu Reeves' guide and mentor. If
only I'd had teachers like this Morpheus in high school! The thought of
reality being broken down into only a series of electrical impulses to our
brains was actually a bit frightening. Almost makes you wonder if anything
really is out there, outside our selves. Keanu Reeves was, as per usual, a
sort of empty vessel in this movie, I could not help wondering how this
movie could have been better with a different actor in the role. Yeah, I had
a little bit of a hard time with the notion of Keanu Reeves as a &quot;chosen
one&quot; of any kind. But on the whole I found this movie rather captivating,
much more thought-provoking that I had anticipated. I especially liked the
idea that deja vu is really a glitch in the Matrix. Hmmm...
Overall I would describe &quot;The Matrix&quot; as a cross between &quot;The Terminator&quot;
and &quot;Strange Days&quot;, with more eye-popping visuals.
I would be very suprised if this movie did not win the Academy Award for
Visual Effects in 2000.
