1999_April 6 

The Matrix is an exciting and very interesting movie.  It combines great
special effects with an interesting story line.  It's only down-side is
that
some of the exposition is heavy-handed and takes too long (there were
parts
of the movie where I was just bored).  But the next fight scene more than
made up for the slow parts and the idea behind it was
compelling.
