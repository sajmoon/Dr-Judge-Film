1999_April 4 

The movie was great!  The actors were perfect in their roles, the plot was a
fantastic idea, and the action scenes were out of this world.  The only
thing you might be disappointed in is the ending of the movie.  Even though
the movie was over 2 hrs. long I wanted more.  Maybe there will be a
sequel.
