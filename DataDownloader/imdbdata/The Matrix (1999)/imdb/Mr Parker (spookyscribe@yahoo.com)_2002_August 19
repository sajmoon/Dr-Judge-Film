You know you've found a special movie when you enjoy it more and more every
time you watch it. The Matrix requires multiple viewings. Not to say that it
isn't an amazing experience the first time around. It's just that watching
it only once robs you of the complete experience. There is so much to this
movie that it goes well beyond what any single user comment can provide. The
special effects are incredible, the acting is satisfactory on all counts,
there are some incredible action sequences (my personal favorite being the
helicopter scene) and the story is great, while not entirely original.
That's not an insult because these days you really can't make a movie
without being influenced by one or several others. This movie was painted
with shades of the Terminator, Ghost in the Shell, Hard Boiled and several
others and it shows. This movie definitely deserves a place as one of the
modern classics of cinema. It's one of the few films that actually succeeds
in creating a living, breathing world. It's not too hard to imagine what
else can be going on in the world of the Matrix other than what you see.
There are so many options, so many exciting possibilities that the
anticipation of waiting for the next two sequels makes you want to drag claw
marks into the face of the person sitting next to you. At the time of this
writing, I am patiently awaiting the sequels, hoping against the history of
bad sequels to great movies that Hollywood can't seem to shake without a few
exceptions. It's a big bar they've raised for themselves and you've gotta
ask if the magic they've captured with the first one is still present enough
to last through a trilogy. Let's hope so. Rating: ***** out of
*****.
