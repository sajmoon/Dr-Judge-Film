The first time I saw The Matrix, I thought it was such tosh that I didn't
even bother to watch all of it. When I came on Cable TV, I decided I would
give it another go. I watched the whole thing, and I was thoroughly
impressed! I think The Matrix is one of those movies were it must be seen
twice to be understood, and to be liked.<br /><br />Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is a bit of a slacker, selling illegal
software on the side under the pseudonym 'Neo' to finance his computer
hardware needs. He wants to find someone called Morpheus (Laurence
Fishburne). He's searching for the answer to a question. He has no idea
where the question came from. But the urge to discover &quot;What is the Matrix?&quot;
will lead him to places where nothing is what is seems and to people who
hope he is The One...<br /><br />Although over-hyped, The Matrix is a largely entertaining sci-fi thriller
with an attitude. The action sequences are stunning, the sound is immaculate
and the acting is very watchable, Fishburne in particular is amazing as
Morpehus.<br /><br />Overall, I strongly recommend The Matrix. It is a stunning, clever and
unique thriller with style.<br /><br />I rate The Matrix 8 out of 10.
