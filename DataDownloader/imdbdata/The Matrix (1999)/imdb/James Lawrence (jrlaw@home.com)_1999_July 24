1999_July 24 

This movie is marvelous.  The effects are unbelievable.  The sound is
excellent.  The action is great.  Even if you don't like Keanu Reeves (I
know so many who make fun of him), you would probably still like this
movie.
The story is one of the most original I've seen in a long time.  The
theme
may not be entirely new (boy meets girl, girl loves boy, boy saves world).
About time actors finally did their own stunts, it makes for a great and
seemless movie.  No need to hide the actors, or digitally replace faces.
It
also makes the fight scenes that much better.  Seen it more than 10 times
now, and only found one thing wrong with the film (usually find many
errors
in most movies).  Definitely see this one, I know i'm getting it on DVD as
soon as it comes out.
