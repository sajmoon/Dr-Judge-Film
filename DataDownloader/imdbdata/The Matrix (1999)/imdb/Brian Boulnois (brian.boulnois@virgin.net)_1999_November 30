Well what can I say thats not been said before,  this film was much better
then Star Wars PM hands down.  At first the plot got me lost but come midway
though it all fits into place like a big jigsaw.  Its about time we had a
classic SC-FI like Matrix, Matrix was like a sleeping gaint it caught
everyone by suprise.  I would recommend this everytime over Star Wars
PM.
