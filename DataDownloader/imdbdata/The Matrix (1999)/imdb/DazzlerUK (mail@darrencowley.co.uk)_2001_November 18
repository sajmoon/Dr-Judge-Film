The Matrix is without doubt the movie that has set the agenda for all other
action movies to follow early in the 21st century. You just have to look at
some of the action sequences from Charlie's Angels to see it's impact on
other film makers. Aside from it's undeniably stunning graphics and images,
is the film actually that great?<br /><br />The plot in my view is trying to be far too clever for it's own good. It is
totally unbelievable, though I must confess this is probably a problem that
lies with me and not the writers. A film has to have some basis in reality
for me to grasp and I found the whole 'human beings as duracell batteries'
plot a little too dum for this man's taste.<br /><br />Some of the acting from the supporting cast is top drawer, particularly
when
you consider that a few of these actors learnt their trade in Australian
and
New Zealand soap operas! Laurence Fishburne turns in an excellent
performance, which is just as well as for most if the film he is having to
carry the inept and wooden performance of Keanu Reeves.<br /><br />Overall I have to admit I enjoyed The Matrix and it's visual delights, but
one of the greatest films ever made? I think not.
