This will blow your mind as Morpheos said to Neo. And guess what: he was
right. This movie is action packed but not all special effects. There are
some really intense action sequences that they were able to create not
involving jumping off walls and shooting a huge bank full of people. Like
when Neo goes into the Matrix for the very first time. Be prepared to learn
something cool about one of the people. Although it does take a little while
before Neo goes into the Matrix. A good hour and a bit. But he does some
extrordinary things like the kungfu scene and his first jump. And even the
first scene when Trinity is in. Whoho. You don't want to miss this. A good
story and good special effects. Too bad the sequels aren't coming out till
2003 and 2004. Take my word on it go see this film. 9/10
