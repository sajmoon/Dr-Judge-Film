1999_April 3 

'The Matrix' is the best film that I have seen in quite some time. It
manages to succeed where other films, such as 'Dark City,' failed. The
action sequences are reminiscent of 'Blade,' which for many was the best US
martial arts film of 1998.<br /><br />Like 'Blade,' I did not have high hopes for this film when I walked into the
theater, but I was extremely happy and excited when I left. The fight
sequences were performed by the actors who played the roles (Reeves,
Fishburne) and were striking. Rarely have I heard an audience so impressed
as after the classic lobby sequence.<br /><br />The film has a number of quirks that seem like flaws the first time around.
The first is the stilted delivery of some of the characters early in the
film. The second is the occasional feeling that something does not quite
match up with earlier statements made in the film, and the third is that it
seems to fall into the classic trap of giving a &quot;love conquers all&quot; ending
to an otherwise tremendous film.<br /><br />However, when you see the film again, you will realize the genius of the
writer/directors of this film. The seemingly stilted delivery in the early
scenes of the film is actually just a pacing of the speeches, a novel way of
breaking up the conversation, which otherwise would turn into an extremely
boring lecture. There is a lot of data that needs to be shared, and it could
drag the film down very quickly if it were not dealt with in this
manner.<br /><br />When you see the film again, the second quirk is also soothed. There is no
statement that directly conflicts with the later scenes in the film. The
oracle speaks very accurately, and only makes the statements that need to be
made. Other characters merely misconstrue her words.<br /><br />The third quirk can be viewed as a fulfillment of an earlier prophecy, and
as such can be used to back up a messianic interpretation of the events of
the film.<br /><br />Perhaps in a novel, the story would have ended differently, and the third
issue would disappear (c.f. 'Blade Runner' v. 'Do Androids Dream of Electric
Sheep,' two totally different takes on a similar group of
characters).<br /><br />The film is filled with little tidbits of information dropped into the story
several minutes before a scene. This is neatly done, and sets up the
audience to be ready for the high points of the film.<br /><br />The music in the film is also quite good, though for some reason the best
material was not included on the soundtrack. It is to be hoped that they
will release an album of music from the film at a later
time.<br /><br />Overall, a great film, with interesting special effects, a believable future
with rules that are meant to be broken, and great music. The direction of
the film is top notch, with performances being tightly controlled to add a
literary element to the film's conversations and little tidbits to keep the
audience entertained. I anxiously await the next film by this writing and
directing duo.
