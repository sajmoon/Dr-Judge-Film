I knew not what to think of The Matrix. I thought it was probably just a
special effects movie that many other films spoofed. Or that Leonard
Maltin
was sick when he gave it a **1/2 rating out of ****. I was proved Leonard
was sick when my friend dragged me to her living room to see the DVD. Wow!
it was phenominal. I never saw anything like it.<br /><br />Yes, it did have a ton of special effects, but the whole movie did not
rely
on them. No one could have directed this movie better thatn The Wachowski
Brothers. It was a little confusing at times, but at the end it pays.
Thank
you, The Wachowski Brothers, for directing and writing this great
movie.<br /><br />This is a must see. It's not only the special F/X guys. A Must for anyone.
An 8/10
