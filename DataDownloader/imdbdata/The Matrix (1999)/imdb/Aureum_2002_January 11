Anyone who has read comics before has seen it. Everyone who's been
watching
Anime for a few years (Japanese animation) has seen it. The Matrix is no
novelty, it just a slightly altered 'Ghost in the Shell'...The directors
did
do a great job by making it available to the general audience whom in
other
circumstances would never even gotten a feel of what goes on inside comic
writers' minds (The directors are also comic book writers, I should add).
Honestly, except for the part of the computer engineered world idea,
nothing
else in the movie was new to me. As I mentioned above, watch 'Ghost in the
Shell', which is previous to 'The Matrix' and you'll know what I
mean...Most
of the ideas came from there...the plugs in the heads, the market chase
scene...it goes on and on...<br /><br />Don't get me wrong...I liked the movie, it was fun, but it wasn't the
best.<br /><br />In a final note, I advise you to read stuff by Grant Morrison, who used to
write JLA, and Warren Ellis. Check out comics in general. Maybe you think
it's a waste of time, but if the Matrix blew your mind, these authors
(amongst many others) will prevent you forever from picking up the
pieces...<br /><br />OH!...and for those of you who think Keanu did a bad job...well, Leo Di
Caprio was originally thought of to play Neo (ugh)...He may  be a better
actor than Keanu...but I don't see him fighting Mr.Smith...do
you?
