The Matrix. Instead of rambling on about the plot. I'll simply say this. An
incredible film, almost frightening in the way that it plays with the
viewer's mind. It will make you question what reality is on even the most
basic scale. Its as if Philip K. Dick and John Woo combined in mind and body
to make a film.
Destined to become a classic.<br /><br />All this and it has Keanu in it! Who'd have thought???
