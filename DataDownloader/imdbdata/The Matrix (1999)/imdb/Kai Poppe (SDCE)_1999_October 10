The Matrix is one of the most realistic films i have ever seen. Don't you
think there IS the POSSIBILITY, that we ALL are only A PART of AN ENORMOUS
machine, doing nothing else than sucking all our life energy out of us ? Of
course, you need to have a good imagination to think about that. But isn't
it possible, that our world, as we know it, is only a computer-generated
model ?
Think about it...
