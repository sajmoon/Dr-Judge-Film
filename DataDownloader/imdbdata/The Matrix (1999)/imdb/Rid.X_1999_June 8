1999_June 8 

The sci-fi genre, save for a few entries (&quot;Contact&quot;, &quot;Pi&quot;, and &quot;Gattaca&quot;
come to mind), is becoming somewhat hollow. The advancement of digital
effects technology has led to the creation of half-realized films that
offer
great visuals, but little more
(see &quot;Godzilla&quot;, &quot;Event Horizon&quot;, &quot;Soldier&quot;, &quot;Lost In Space&quot;,
or &quot;Wing Commander&quot; for recent examples.) The Wachowski Brothers, who
wrote
the tepid Stallone actioner &quot;Assassins&quot; and
gained recognition with their brilliant 1996 crime thriller
&quot;Bound&quot;, return with &quot;The Matrix&quot;, a rare mix of intelligence
and movie magic.<br /><br />The last time Keanu Reeves entered the realm of cyberpunk
sci-fi was the weak offering, &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;. Here,
as
computer programmer Thomas Anderson/hacker Neo, he actually
shines. &quot;Speed&quot; showed he had a flair for playing the action
hero; the movie further proves it.<br /><br />Reeves is matched by the ever-reliable Laurence Fishburne
as Morpheus, who guides Neo as he begins to understand the nature of the
matrix, and his reality in general. Carrie-Anne
Moss is impressive as Trinity, a headstrong female who can
more
than hold her own.<br /><br />It's the technical aspects of the film that have made it a blockbuster.
From
Bill Pope's cinematography, which incorporates
a number of angles and effects, to the brilliantly-staged
John Woo-inspired gun battles, to the fight chereography
by
Hong Kong fight master Woo-ping Yuen, to the eye-popping
digital
and visual effects, &quot;The Matrix&quot; has incredible eye candy
that
serves the plot, not vice versa.<br /><br />In short, the film doesn't disappoint. Highly recommended.
