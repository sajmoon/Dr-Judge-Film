This film operates on many levels - the most profound of which is probably
the handling of fate and destiny. It is an excellent film. The inter-play of
reality / virtual reality is delightfull handled, even in post-Kantian
hermeneutics.<br /><br />But is 'mind over matter' or 'just beleiveing' enough to shape our destiny?
What happens when life seems to conspire against us, and nothing we do can
control our events?<br /><br />If all this is beyond you - just enjoy a great action movie with stunning
special effects.<br /><br />
