&quot;Wow&quot; is all I can say about this film. It is visually incredible, and
Keanu
Reeves makes a nice Bruce Lee (ha ha ha. Those of you who saw the film
will
understand that one). With a million films coming out each year, it takes
a
lot to really impress me nowadays. Films need decent, original plots that
have never been used before for me to even look at them. I reached this
conclusion when watching such sci-fi classics as the Star Wars trilogy and
the first Highlander film. I considered myself pretty spoiled, and after
such high-quality films as those, few movies make my eyes pop. But The
Matrix did. It's visuals are incredible, and it's cast and plot are so
brand
new and refreshing, I now consider myself truly thrilled by it. Why don't
they make more movies this good nowadays?<br /><br />I won't reveal the plot, but I'll just say this: Nothing is as it seems.
Nothing. You don't exist, and the world is run by robots.<br /><br />Confused? Go watch the movie and find out for yourself.<br /><br />I am convinced that if when movies first came out, and they had all the
great technology back then that they have now, they had made the Star Wars
trilogy, the first Highlander, and The Matrix, no other movie would have
ever had to have been made. They are so superior, nothing could have ever
topped them, so they shouldn't have even tried.<br /><br />The Matrix....One of just a handful of sci-fi masterpieces!
