1999_April 6 

Until I checked the comments here I knew two types of people. Those who
loved it and those who hadn't seen it. I saw it for the second time
tonight
with a bunch of friends. For some this was their fourth time. Pretty
scary,
it reminded me of Titanic.
One of my friends is in the film school here at CU and he loved it. Now we
are all pretty sure that Keanu Reeves is not a good actor (for some that
is
putting it mildly). How ever THIS was his kind of role and for once he
actually did a good job. (Personally, I liked Speed too, but it was far
from
great).
This movie had a little of everything. It had the philosophy, the Sci-fi,
the
horror(those squids were FREAKY and the &quot;bug&quot; gave me shivers), a dash of
love, martial arts, and of course, action. There were religous references,
literary references and more. All in all don't believe me that it's good,
and PLEASE don't listen to someone else that it was bad. Take a chance and
see it for yourself. Spend some change and chances are good that you won't
regret it. You'll either love it or hate it. There is no middle
ground.
