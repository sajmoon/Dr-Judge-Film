1999_September 29 

I saw this movie after months of waiting and it was more than I expected
to
see. I figured to see a kick-ass, shoot-em-up sci-fi movie. It was all
that
and more! It also leaves you thinking about the world around you. I
thought
when &quot;mouse&quot; made the reference about everything tasting like chicken,
there
probably wasn't a single person not laughing at the theater. Although it
drags a little, there is plenty of action to make up for it.The only thing
is that you have to pay close attention to the story, because if you
don't,
you could miss something. I saw it three times before I caught everything.
The eye-popping effects are worth the price of the DVD.<br /><br />The best thing about the movie is that it leaves the story
open for a sequel. I absolutely loved it!!!!!!
