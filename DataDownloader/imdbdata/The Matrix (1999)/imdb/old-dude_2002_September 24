This movies proves why one man's trash is another man's treasure. So
many of my friends loved this movie. I literally could not sit though it
and
walked out after about 45 minutes. The setup was pretty cool and the
special
effects were top notch but it degenerated in to shoot outs and fist fights
and the same old dog crap that we have seen again and again and again. If
you like World Wrestling on TV then you will love The Matrix. If you are a
sci-fi fan who wants anything remotely intellectual in nature then you are
much better off watching a rerun of any Deep Space Nine episode.
