Unoriginal? I never saw anything like this. Sure they might have borrowed
some elements from different movies, but so does every single movie in the
world to an extent.<br /><br />Listing anime films as the original source for a lot of the ideas in Matrix
doesn't help one's argument in showing how unoriginal The Matrix is because
Japanese animation and comics are about as unoriginal as things get. Artists
and animators borrow each other's plots and subplots constantly, characters
often with only a few minor changes in appearance/personality, etc. Anime
has to be one of the most cliched things in the world and I know this
because I am Japanese and grew up on it.<br /><br />Like StarCastle99 said, this movie has set new standards. As unoriginal as
the ideas might be, it's still a very original and stylish movie as a whole
that deserves recognition.
