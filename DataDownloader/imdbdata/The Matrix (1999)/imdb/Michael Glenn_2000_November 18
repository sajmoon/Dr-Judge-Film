This movie will certainly remain my favorite for quite some time.  The
action and movie affects are engrossing, and it will be the standard other
movies are compared against for at least a decade.  The story was
creative,
the acting was supurb, and overall I can't think of a single
flaw.<br /><br />Great movie!  Buy the DVD and watch it over and over.
