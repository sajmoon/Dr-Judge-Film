1999_April 16 

I went into this movie thinking it would be just a movie to pass the time.
But was I wrong.  From the moment it starts it captures you into its web of
twists and turns.  It has the best special effects I've seen in a long time,
and the best action sequences since Face/Off.  Go see this movie RIGHT
NOW.
