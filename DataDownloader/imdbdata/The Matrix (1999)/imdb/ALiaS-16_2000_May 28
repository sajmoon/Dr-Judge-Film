This is one of those films that only come around once in a short while.
One
of those films that will be talked about for years and years to come!  The
first time you see it, you are astounded.....and every time after you are
still astounded!  This film only gets better as you watch it more...  I
have
seen this movie more times than i could count, and it only gets better!
Yes, true there are a few points that could have been better explained, but
i think some of the trivial problems people have with it can be
explained......just watch it a few thousand more times and you will see the
answers....  The story for those that havent seen it (as if they exist) is
basically a philosophical study of the soul.....and the human mind.  It is
in fact very Buddhist influenced.  One of the other incredible things about
this film is that it is only the beginning, and easily lays ground to the
sequels....i dont think that making it a trilogy will hurt the story, but
expand upon it..  I think we are looking at another Star Wars....another
cult followed holy trilogy!  Keep studying and perhaps you too will reach
Xion!<br /><br />Another incredible movie that i HIGHLY recommend is Fight Club.  The other
new Classic of `99!!!!!
