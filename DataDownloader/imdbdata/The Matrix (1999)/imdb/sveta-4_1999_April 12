The Matrix is one of the best movies ever made. It combines incredibly
involved and intriguing script with outstanding visual effects. The Matrix
makes you stop and think about your own life and questions that bother all
of us &quot;what is real?&quot; The martial arts scenes are probably the best ever
done by western actors--Bravo! Keanu Reeves (and I am not even a fan).
They
can be comparable only to Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan. I guarantee that it
will become one of your favorite movies
