1999_August 7 

This is a very nice picture. A point of view of a not so far future. It's
very difficult that it will happen, but ... who know. The
computers/machines
evolution grows in exponential mode. 30 years ago the man step on the
moon.
What we can do in 30 more?<br /><br />The film remember some things of the picture Brazil.
Some ideas in the film &quot;the matrix&quot; about the reality were commented by a
lot of people. I.E.: &quot;Is real the reality&quot;, a book of Paul
Watslawick.<br /><br />My impression of the film is the nice way that is interpreted the idea of
the reality, and how that idea is communicated to the spectator. Many
things
are perfect, like the oracle, the matrix itself, the &quot;deja vu&quot;, the name
of
the ship and in general all the names, the training programs and a lot
more.<br /><br />I think:  Why they can't use cordless telephones to run out the
matrix?<br /><br />This is a picture to see several times and to analyse a lot of things of
it.<br /><br />Pd: Sorry by my poor english.
