1999_April 6 

This movie blew me away.  I loved how it started off slow.  It
introduced you into the world, and gave a chance for the
audience to understand and be in that world.  When the amazing
action sequences came, they didn't seem as if they were the
reason for the movie (which is what I feared).  Everyone always
disses on Keanu, but he was alright in this movie.  Give the guy
a break, he has that charasmatic hero appeal that made him
popular in &quot;Speed.&quot;  The Wachowski brothers have hit gold twice
now (I loved &quot;Bound&quot; as well).  I urge everyone to go see it.
