1999_September 24 

I can't believe I wasted two hours on this drivel. I guess it had *some*
redeeming value, since I didn't turn it off after the first few minutes, but
I wish I had. The plotline was tortuous, the effects mediocre, and the
dialog atrocious. I had gotten it for the special effects and even those
were disappointing. And the ending... blah!
