At first, I was pretty hesitant about a science fiction film with Keanu
Reeves, of all actors.  But the movie actually turned out to be one of the
best science fiction films that isn't Star Wars, or Star Trek.<br /><br />Lawrence Fishburne adds respectability to the cast, and the plot, though
confusing at first, is pretty cool and original.<br /><br />The best thing about the movie is the special effects and the impressive
martial arts fights.  The two main ones, where Fishburne and Reeves square
off, and where Reeves meets one of the agents, were choreographed by the
same guy who does the Jet Li scenes, were some of the best work i've seen
done in an american film.<br /><br />All in all, a very entertaining film, i don't think sci-fi flicks were
meant
to be criticized.  You either like em or you don't.  And i thought this one
was pretty cool.
