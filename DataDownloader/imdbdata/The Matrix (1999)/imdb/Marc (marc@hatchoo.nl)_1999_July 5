1999_July 5 

People don't always visit a movie theater to be told a story that is 100%
realistic. If you want to make a SF movie about computers taking over the
world there will be plot holes and inaccuracies. I've put a lot of
question
marks behind the whole Matrix story. But I am not complaining about it.
When
I took my little sister to see Dumbo, I wasn't telling her that elephants
couldn't fly either.<br /><br />Ok, the specials FX were great, the styling of the movie was great, the
actors played very well too. Even the jokes were quite funny. But for some
strange reason I couldn't wait for the movie to end. I would have walked
out
of the theatre if I weren't there with my friends that didn't want to
leave.<br /><br />The scenes where Neo and Morpheus were alone in the big empty white
computer
generated room gave me a claustrophobic feeling. The cuts between the dark
'realistic' world and this endless white space gave me a headache. Again,
so
did all of the abrupt cuts between most scenes. Probably the fact I was
sitting on row 4 had something to do with it.<br /><br />The end of the movie did come as a surprise to me. I thought that the
movie
was about Neo conquering the Matrix. Probably that's what episode II is
about, cause this one was only about to be He or not to be He. It wasn't
very exciting cause the whole theatre knew all along young Skywalker, eh,
I
meant Neo, was He. The force indeed is strong with this boy. Maybe he can
bring balance.blablabla.<br /><br />
