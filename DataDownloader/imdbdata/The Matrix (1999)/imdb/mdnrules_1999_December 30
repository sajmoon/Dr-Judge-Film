1999_December 30 

I finally saw this one, and I'm glad I did.  Some people didn't like the
acting, but I thought it was fine.  The storyline seems to get in the way of
the action at first, but if you take the time to watch this 3 or 4 times,
the storyline ADDS a lot to the film and shows you that the awesome
gun-flashing scenes had a reason to them.  <br /><br />Agent Smith was cool, the kung-fu action scene was cool, the guns were cool,
and the special effects were great.  I don't want to dissapoint anybody by
giving them high expectations before they saw the movie, but this is a great
movie.  How can you resist the idea of being able to download ANYTHING you
want to learn in an instant?  10 years of kung-fu experience downloaded into
your brain in 7 seconds!  The idea is as seductive as time travel, which
made Back To The Future so popular.  See this!!!!
