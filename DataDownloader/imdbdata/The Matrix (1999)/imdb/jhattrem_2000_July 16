Excellent movie. While certainly not a Christian movie, it has many
Christian parallels.<br /><br />The whole concept of &quot;The Matrix&quot; applies aptly to our time. Our &quot;matrix&quot;
is
created by the major news media, Hollywood, the government, etc. They all
tell us what to believe and they all lie to us with relative impunity. Only
a few of us know the truth.<br /><br />I eagerly await the sequels and highly recommend this fast-moving movie to
all.
