1999_April 19 

Another plus for Keanu. Loving Carie-Anne and Lawrence . At first, I didn't
really care about seeing the movie, I could've waited till it came out on
video. But my dad suggested it, we saw it, and I was blown away. It's now my
fav movie, I've seen it 4 whole times and 2 half times. I know almost every
line and have two copies of the soundtrack. Unfortunatly no one can be told
what the matrix is, you have to see it for yourself. So get out there and
see it, you'll fall in love with all the characters.( and the fight scenes
)
