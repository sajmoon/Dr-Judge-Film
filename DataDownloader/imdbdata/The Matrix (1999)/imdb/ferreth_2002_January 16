I was actually fairly engaged in this movie until we got to the 'real'
world
circa the future of a few humans left fighting in a world taken over by
machines. At that point, this becomes a 'bad science' movie that p***ed me
off several times for such things as
- Reading the matrix off of a computer screen,
- Harvesting 'bio energy' off of humans,
- Having to create an illusion for humans to live rather than just making
them brain dead.
Good science and good SF can work together just fine, or at least make it
jive with reality!
Despite the science, this really is not a bad SF movie, exploring the
concept of if 'reality' matters versus the experience, the mental duel
with
the machine has shades of the of 'if you believe wholly in something, it
must be real; if it's not real, you must not believe wholly in it'.<br /><br />Being rated as top ten in the SF category (4th today) is way too high. In
the fullness of time, this *might* be considered in the top 25 of the
century, but right now it's over rated, probably by those who have not
seen
enough truly great SF. My prediction is that this movie will drop out of
the
top ten, eventually.
If you have not seen this movie, sure, go rent it. Just don't believe all
they hype you hear about this being one of the best SF movies of all
time.
