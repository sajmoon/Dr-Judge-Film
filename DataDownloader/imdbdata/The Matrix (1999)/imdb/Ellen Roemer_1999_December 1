1999_December 1 

My husband and I are Science Fiction types and we found this film excellent
from that angle.  It was reminiscent in places of a couple novels or short
stories we have read but with a twist that was intriguing.  I also saw some
tones of a religious bent, the good being attacked by the evil aliens and
how different reality is once released from the safe world.  I am not
impressed with violence for violence sake or even violence for special
effects sake and here the movie falls in my opinion.  I hope there will be a
sequel with more work on the theme of which world is better, the real or the
protected cocoon.
