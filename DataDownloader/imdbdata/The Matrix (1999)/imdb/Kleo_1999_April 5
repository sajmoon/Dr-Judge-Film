1999_April 5 

This was an awesome movie. It was well shot, the plot was good, and so was
the dialogue except for a few cheesy throwaway lines. But dialogue is not
what you see a movie for. You see a movie to be entertained, and the Matrix
delivers. It is visually beautiful, and the special effects were absolutely
amazing. The Kung fu scenes were great, and damn, I want Trinity's wardrobe.<br /><br />This movie also does something rare. It makes you wonder. What if there
really is no spoon?<br /><br />Enjoy the movie, if you haven't already seen it.
