The Matrix was a movie I was a bit skeptical about when I first heard
about
it.  The idea of it sounded a bit like 'Dark City'.  But it is nothing
like
it.  The Matrix isn't as dark as 'Dark City', and really can't be compared
to it.  The story of The Matrix was not very original, but bent so it
feels
like something new.  Anyone who has seen Dark City will probably be
interested in seeing The Matrix.  The acting was good.  The Wachowski
brothers has the talent that John Woo has...They can make anyone look
cool,
and the outcome is evident in 'The Matrix'.<br /><br />The special effects are you best I've seen.  'Bullet Time', as what the
directors call it, is very impressive.  There is nothing like bullet time.
The only thing I can think of is in 'Lost in Space', where they use their
hyper-drive.<br /><br />The Matrix needs to be seen by any action fanatic.
