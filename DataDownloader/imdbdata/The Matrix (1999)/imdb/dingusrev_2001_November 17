ladies and gentlefolk let me give you the biggest pile of overrated
nonsense
in the history of film.  Let me start with the plot:- great, superb,
GENIUS....shame about the execution.  Some great GREAT ideas, but when you
get the tree-bark esque acting skills of keanu reeves to carry them off,
you
just know, somewhere inside of you that this film will be
somewhat..IFFY.<br /><br />Ok now onto the acting.......ok so we're done! (im sorry but who the hell
pays keanu reeves $20m dollars to act....please keanu, if you are
reading.....lend me a tenner mate!!).<br /><br />Ok so the effects.......oh my.......the effects are stunning, simply
gorgeous, rippling bullet effects, that wee spinning camera
job.....FANTASTIC, i suppose you wont feel cheated spending money on
seeing
this title as the effects are worth admission price alone.<br /><br />now, this does NOT deserve to be in the top 50 greatest films of all time,
oh no!, how it gets above such underrated classics such as AMERICAN PSYCHO
and HEAT is beyond me.<br /><br />so in short, THE MATRIX isnt a BAD movie, its just so highly overrated.  I
think for me, the feeling I got after watching the matrix, was the same
feeling when i spent $1 dollar on a lotto scratchcard and won $1! that
little feeling 'oh!! ive won!!...oh wait...'<br /><br />THE MATRIX - 6/10 (ok so i rated it five!!....shoot me!)
