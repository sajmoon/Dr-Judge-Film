1999_June 17 

The Matrix has managed to build tremendous word of mouth and great
publicity
based mainly on silence and mystery.  The advance word was that it was
&quot;amazing&quot;, &quot;mind blowing&quot; and the like.  It's not of course.  But it is
ground breaking.  This is not necessarily a good thing
however.<br /><br />The movie starts in a green-filtered world.  Coming off like a cross
between
the urban nightmare of &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and the claustrophobic intensity of
&quot;Eraserhead&quot;.  Keanu Reeves inhabits a grey-green world populated by pasty
people whose lives are dominated by technology.
What no-one seems to realise is just how far that domination goes, and
that
in fact computers are not only running the world but manipulating reality
itself.<br /><br />Keanu is contacted by a bunch of cool hackers who slowly introduce him to
the truth, and his place in it.  He is transformed from hacker geek into a
lean mean Keanu machine, expert at martial arts and shooter of HUGE
weapons.<br /><br />Well, come on, this is an adaptation of a comic book - it has to fulfill
at
least ten adolescent fantasies.  Did I mention that a cool girl fancies
him
as well?  There we go, that's fantasy number 3 taken care of...  As the
truth dawns, colour seeps back into the movie, like a nightmarish &quot;Wizard
of
Oz&quot;, and Keanu assumes his role as saviour of mankind (boy are we in
trouble).<br /><br />The world this movie depicts is one where computers are blurry, fuzzy
things.  Computers that look like they were build by over-adventurous Blue
Peter presenters out of bits of vacuum cleaner and cling film.  In the
Cronenbergian future, computers will be more organic, the film suggests,
and
more &quot;understood&quot; than programmed, where a well-timed kick will serve just
as well as a keystroke.
At the same time, the movie darkly hints at our ongoing &quot;evolution&quot; from
humankind to machinekind.  We're losing something in the technical age, it
warns.  I think they were talking about human warmth, but I'm not sure
because there wasn't a lot of that on evidence.  Did I mention
innocent
bystanders don't do particularly well in this film?   (Can't these people
learn to duck for god's sake?)<br /><br />The movie builds very slowly to its' extremely violent climax.  The last
half-hour is a veritable orgasm of bullets, violence and bits of falling
masonry.  But we take an awful long time to get there.  The film gives us
each new revelation with a breathless sort of
oooh-you'll-never-guess-what-ness
about it.  This is the mind-blowing part by
the way.  I suppose it would be mind-blowing for those of us who haven't
seen &quot;Blade Runner&quot; or &quot;Total Recall&quot;, because we're in: &quot;What is real,
and
what is reality anyway?&quot; territory (again).<br /><br />The style of the film is where the film brings us something new however.
It
borrows in style from &quot;Terminator&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot;,
&quot;Aliens&quot; and that horrid Bacardi advert with the cute couple trying to
escape the bald guy that goes on forever.  This is science fiction noir,
full of red brake lights glowing under rain, and computer screens glowing
darkly in dim rooms.  The movie also borrows liberally from the
slow-motion
violence of Sergio Leone, Sam Peckinpah and far eastern directors such
as
John Woo.   Like Tarantino, this is a film with a plagiaristic eye on
previous action movies, both referencing and parodying them at the same
time.<br /><br />But by far the biggest influence on this movie is comic books.  Whole
scenes
are shot and framed like comic books, with artefacts shot in close up and
actors framed behind.  Keanu himself is turned into a walking piece of
anime, exuding a blank sort of menace behind dark glasses and swirling
leather.  The dialogue is stagy and melodramatic like a comic book.  So
much
so that I kept expecting the dialogue to come out of the actor's mouths in
little bubbles, but it never happened.  And let's not forget the huge
impact
that computer games have had on this film, the action set pieces look like
they might have
been computer generated, and actors take a lickin' yet keep on gettin' up
until the big GAME OVER in the sky beckons.<br /><br />This is absolutely the style of movies to come, it will be duplicated, and
built upon, much as &quot;Blade Runner&quot; was.  It's not a bad thing, but it
definitely sets a new level of style over substance in the movies.  The
plot
attempts depth, and the script has some gratifying moments of humour, but
lets face it, what we're here for is the slam-bang, action packed,
bullets-flyin' finale and to hell with the plot.  You get it, but it's a
long slog.  They would have been better off calling the movie &quot;Blank
People
Shooting at Each Other With Large Guns&quot; and got down on it in the first
half-hour.  It would have made for a shorter movie, and I wouldn't have
been
so late to bed.<br /><br />I'm not saying &quot;The Matrix&quot; is a bad movie.  It's an action movie, which
at
least looks damn good and attempts a little on the intellectual side.
Just
don't expect too much, of it - it's not the second coming...<br /><br />
