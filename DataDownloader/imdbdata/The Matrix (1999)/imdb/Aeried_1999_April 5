1999_April 5 

Don't get me wrong. This is a great guy flick and I like guy films as much
as the next guy. The Wachowski Brothers do a remarkable job combining sfx
with kung-fu and 8mms. The premise even creeped me out (and that's good!).
My main problem was these glaring plot holes. In order to turn this film
into a Blade Runner type classic sci-fi
film, the filmmakers would have had to not give in to the Hollywood
mentality that movies must end on a hopeful note, heroes must win, etc.<br /><br />The movie's ending left a very bad taste in my mouth (kind of like battery
acid). Too bad because I liked all the sfx and fights. Cool
stuff.
My ending is not the kind of ending to pull in audiences, but it certainly
would have been more honest. If the producers had been honest with us and
themselves, I would probably given the film another point or
two.
