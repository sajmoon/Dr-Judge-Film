1999_April 4 

There is one thing that I love to see in a film, I love to see a story line
that makes you sit back and say to yourself, &quot;woah, what the hell am I
looking at?&quot;  The Matrix more than delivers.  Every time you think that you
can tell what the Matrix is, BOOM, something new is tossed into the picture.
The special effects are more than awesome.  In most films that are loaded
with special effects, it looks cheesey and overdone, not in this case.
Everything is right on.<br /><br />The Action scenes were something to drool on.  I haven't had so much fun
watching a massive display of violence since Blade!!!  The Matrix tickled my
violence bone on more than one occasion.<br /><br />I have a new found respect for Keanu.  I started to think he was going to
wash up and be a wonderful Hollywood has been, thank everything holy that he
proved me wrong.<br /><br />The only advice I have to give to anyone going to see it, don't bring
younger children.  I had the misfortune of having a family of five year olds
sitting behind me and they didn't understand a thing that was going on and
they would not shut up!!!<br /><br />To sum it all up, it's pretty good.
