&#x27;The Matrix&#x27; is Truly a Legendary film, that offers SOLID
Entertainment. From start to finish, this cult-classic leaves you
spell-bound by its delicious writing material, stylish direction,
amazing action &#x26; killer performances.<br /><br />&#x27;The Matrix&#x27; Synopsis: A computer hacker learns from mysterious rebels
about the true nature of his reality and his role in the war against
its controllers.<br /><br />&#x27;The Matrix&#x27; is one of my favorite films. I&#x27;ve seen it a dozen of times
&#x26; when-ever I re-visit it, it only gets better. It&#x27;s a solid
entertainer, that is simply spell-binding.<br /><br />Andy Wachowski &#x26; Larry Wachowski&#x27;s Screenplay &#x26; Direction, both deserve
top-honors. Their Screenplay is delicious, while, Their Direction is
damn stylish. The entire execution to this box-office blockbuster
deserves full marks. Action-Sequences are simply, amazing.
Cinematography is flawless. Editing is neat. Art Design &#x26; Graphics are
incredibly done.<br /><br />Performance-Wise: Keanu Reeves as Neo, delivers one of his best
performances in here. He&#x27;s in top-form! Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus,
is fantastic! Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith, is superlative. Carrie-Anne
Moss as Trinity, does well. Joe Pantoliano as Cypher, is impressive.
Julian Arahanga as Apoc, is decent. Gloria Foster as the Oracle, leaves
a mark.<br /><br />On the whole, &#x27;The Matrix&#x27; is Cinema At Its Finest!
