1999_August 10 

The person who entered the movies to watch &quot;The Matrix&quot; didn't get out of
it
the same one... And I am speaking for myself! I felt like I could walk on
the walls, like I could run that fast or flee from bullets... It's
hypnotic,
grandiose, detailed... Nothing bad for Wachowski brothers, which, in an
universe of movie business where we are used to watch to action movies
without any story, their job is unbelievably extraordinary. It really
takes
your breath away. You feel as if you were under effect of some kind of
drug!
Those fights are the best ones I've ever seen in my whole life, and I
don't
even like fights at all (until now), just because the truth is that those
fights look like &quot;ballet&quot;... Like said Keanu Reeves (probably the only guy
crazy enough to understand what was that movie all about without watching
it): &quot;it's all about love, evolution, faith, questions, authority,
systems,
order&quot;... To cut it short, it's impossible to say what is the Matrix...
You
have to see it!
One of the bests movies I have ever seen!!!
