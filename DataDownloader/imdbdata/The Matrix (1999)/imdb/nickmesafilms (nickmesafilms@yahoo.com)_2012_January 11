Written and directed by the Wachowski Brothers, &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; is a
high-tech, edge-of-your-seat, heart-pounding sci-fi action thriller,
that will make you want to see it the second time to understand what
the heck is going on. The film talks about a future like no other, so
technologically advanced that we don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s real or not.
Everyone is in the middle of a simulated reality to subdue the human
population. A computer hacker, under the name of &#x22;Neo&#x22;, portrayed by
Keanu Reeves, is drawn into this rebellion, and fight off against the
machines. I&#x27;m obviously a fan of big sci-fi action thrillers that make
you pay attention throughout. This movie is one of the best examples.
The casting is golden, from Keanu Reeves&#x27; performance that left his
signature as an actor, to Lawrence Fishburne as the mysterious leader
of the Matrix, Morpheus. Hugo Weaving and Carrie-Annie Moss round up
the supporting cast, and they perform just fine. But, my favorite thing
about this movie, was all the incredible technological advantages that
were added. This movie is filled with groundbreaking editing,
fast-paced cinematography, astounding sound effects, and the
jaw-dropping visual effects that are still memorable to this day. That
slow-motion gun bullet scene is still quite memorable, you know! From
the sharp well-written script, the incredible acting, the
groundbreaking visual effects, to the smart directing of the
Wachowskis, &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; is truly a favorite for all cinema lovers.
It&#x27;s a fun, non-stop, and exciting motion picture that will take away
the 136-minute run time quickly. No wonder movies always go &#x22;copy-cat&#x22;
on this movie! &#x22;The Matrix&#x22;, in my review, &#x22;a non-stop exciting motion
picture, with groundbreaking visuals&#x22;.
