2001_November 15 

I have only seen this film twice.  The second time being last night.  Well,
the first time I saw it was when it was released on Video.  I must say, I
remember not being impressed with it.  <br /><br />Well, on second viewing...God was I wrong.  Yeah, The stunts are amazing to
say the least, but the story is so complex and in depth.  It is unusual for
this type of movie.  A big Budget action film typically will not have a
decent plot...It is all about FX.  Well, this does that, but it is built
around a wonder story, and of course I hope will be explored much more in
the next 2 sequels.  <br /><br />Reeves is excellently cast as Neo.  Probably one of the better roled he has
ever played.  He is dynamic and pure in his acting in this film.  You can
tell he was really into making this film.<br /><br />All other characters are also equally excellent.  Fisburne, almost an Obi
Wan type character is superb.  Moss is gorgeous and deadly as
Trinity.<br /><br />With my faith reevaulated, I plan on watching this on a few more times, and
cannot wait till 2003 for The Matrix, Reloaded.  The directors clearly know
what they are doing, and enjoy it emmencely.  <br /><br />Superior film with mind blowing effect and an exceptional
story.<br /><br />9 out of 10
