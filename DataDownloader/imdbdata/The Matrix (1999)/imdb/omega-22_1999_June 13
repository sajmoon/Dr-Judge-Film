1999_June 13 

Th Matrix was without a doubt the most well written science fiction
film in the past 5 years or so. I was blown away by how they created such
a
hard to believe world but yet managed to make you believe it. The whole
theme
of the film (at least this is what I think) was a reflection of our own
lives and how we live in a world that's made up of so many distractions we
never really realize whats going on around us. So many people shut their
eyes to many events that happen in the real world and get lost in their
own
private worlds. Well to describe the theme this movie tries to pass on to
the viewers. I can do this in three words. FREE YOUR MIND. Like I said
thats
just what I think. Maybe you do too.
