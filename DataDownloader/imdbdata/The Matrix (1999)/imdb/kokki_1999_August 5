I had high hopes when entering the movie theatre so it would be hard to
satisfy me with some nice special effects or a couple of explosions. Guess
what? It was incredibly entertaining, every second of it. Great storyline,
best sfx ever seen, very stylish and even ... intelligent. Can't wait for
the sequel!
