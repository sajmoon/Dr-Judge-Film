1999_July 7 

I saw the ad's on the television and thought that it would be one of
those
psychological thrillers, but it turned out to be just the opposite. Sure
it
made you think, well what if I am in a world run by machines, but it had
more action than I thought it would.
The opening 20-30 minutes was just like what I thought, you know,
psychological, but then it turned and more action was displayed as the
movie
went on. I stayed interested until the very end where the whole plot was
summed up and he changed what the psychic lady told him.
The fighting scenes where they ignored gravity seemed very unrealistic
and
it took away from the movie, but all in all it was an awesome
movie.
