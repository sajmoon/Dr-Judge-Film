1999_June 24 

hmm. no sirey didn't like it. Too me it was a long advert, pretty much
like
the Smirnoff Vodka one they show at the pictures, in the rescue scene
where
they go to get morpheus i'm sure the Smirnoff music is playing in the
backround - naff kung fu and special effects courtesy of the Gap adverts
frozen in space technic. Keanu as the chosen one, why was he chosen? was
William Shatner not available, both are from the wooden school of acting.
I
might revolt against technology myself by not going to see anymore hyped
up
US rubbish built around special effects; death to the special effect I
say,
who's with me?<br /><br />ranting over -
