What is The Matrix?<br /><br />It is the future, and apocalypse has narrowly been avoided following war
between man and machine.  Humans are now enslaved; they are merely
individual power cells, each kept alive by &#145;living' within a computer
programme &#150; The Matrix.  Thomas A. Anderson (Keanu Reeves), exists as a
program writer by day and as Neo, an infamous computer hacker, at night. 
Following his curiosity and the instructions of Trinity (Carrie Anne Moss),
Neo is lead to Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne), the leader of a small band of
freedom fighters.  Danger lurks in the form of Sentinels and Agents, both
programmed by the Matrix to seek out and destroy free human life.  Under the
guidance of Morpheus, Neo begins to explore a life of dual existence,
discovering the truth about himself and the surrounding
world.<br /><br />The Matrix succeeds in being both intellectually and visually stimulating. 
Revolutionary fight scenes and state of the art special effects are matched
by a high-tempo script, and a comic book style, which keeps the audience on
tenterhooks. Although firmly based in science fiction, The Matrix is not
limited to this genre, as it explores martial arts, philosophy, religion,
humanity and love.  Fishburne is excellent as the profound Morpheus,
likewise Weaving as the eerie Agent Smith, and even Reeves convinces as the
wide-eyed Neo.  Direction is slick, with impressive camera work, a good
supporting cast and a genuinely unique feel.  The Matrix is an influential
and groundbreaking film, which deserves to be regarded as a
masterpiece
of modern cinema.
