A Hollywood film of tremendous value -- a great gift to the<br /><br />revolutionary movement on par with that of  Reds  
politically and done artistically as well as can be with<br /><br />special effects. Humyn-beings both dead and alive are 
tended by machines in gigantic mechanical farms where they<br /><br />are used as batteries for the various kinds of heat and<br /><br />electricity that they produce. Not only does the script-<br /><br />writer uphold materialism as the existence of an external<br /><br />world independent of the subject (humyn mind), but also the<br /><br />script-writer shows us how science will conquer and make<br /><br />everything knowable including dreams. There are a few 
drawbacks to this film, but on the whole, MIM could not<br /><br />have asked for more in a two and a half hour Hollywood<br /><br />movie. We can use the movie to educate people about 
dialectics, modes of production, Lenin's book &quot;Materialism<br /><br />and Empirio-Criticism&quot; and the drawbacks of anarchism and<br /><br />individualism.
