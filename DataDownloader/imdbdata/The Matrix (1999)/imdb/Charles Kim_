It's been a while since a movie has generated enough interest in me for me to
watch it.  &quot;The Matrix&quot; looked exciting enough in the trailers, so I decided
to give it a look.  What I found was an amazing movie, with some of the
greatest special effects I've ever seen.  The camera angles really work for
the action sequences and the choreographed fight scenes made me yearn for
more.  Say what you want about Keanu Reeves' acting.  He may not deliver the
best dialogue, but his look can carry a film.  He was a great choice for the
role of Neo.  Carrie Anne Moss was great as was the underrated Laurence
Fishburne.  I highly recommend this film for those who are a fan of visually
stunning movies.  It will blow away your senses...
