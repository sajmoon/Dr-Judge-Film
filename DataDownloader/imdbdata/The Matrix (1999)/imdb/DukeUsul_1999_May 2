The Matrix is a very entertaining, thought-provoking film that combined
great camera work with a bold storyline.  It takes place about 200 years
from today, in a world ruled by computers.  Man programmed them to learn
and
evolve and is now reaping the punishment for that.  Humans are slaves to
the
machines, living out their whole lives in cocoons where their biochemical
energy is &quot;farmed&quot; to power the computers.  While their bodies are trapped
in these cocoons, their minds are trapped in &quot;The Matrix,&quot; a hideously
complex computer simulation of late 20th Century.  The humans live happy
lives in this imagined world, ignorant of the true reality.<br /><br />But there are a handful of humans who live outside the Matrix.  These
computer &quot;hackers&quot; who live on the run from the computers know how to tap
into the Matrix.  They can observe those trapped in the program.  They can
even help them escape.  But they are first looking for the man who will
fulfill the Oracle's prophecy: the man who has the ability to &quot;change
things&quot; inside the Matrix.  The man who will be able to free humankind
from
bondage.
