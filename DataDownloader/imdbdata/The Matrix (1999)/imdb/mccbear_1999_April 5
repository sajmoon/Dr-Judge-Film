1999_April 5 

All of the speculation about Keanu Reeves' acting ability are basically
irrelevant to this film, since it really hasn't much to do with whether he
can act--he isn't asked to do much acting.  It's 90% about the gorgeous,
fascinating effects, which really drive the plot and are the true star.
(Though Joe Pantoliano once again proves himself interesting and gifted.)
This film is just for fun, and very satisfying for a dyed-in-the-wool sci fi
fan.  The obvious sequel set-up was okay with me; I'll go to see
it.
