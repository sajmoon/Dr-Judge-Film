The best action movie ever made. Period. I mean, Face/Off is a definite
close second, but John Woo missed one thing...Agent Smith! I thought the
agents were the coolest part of the movie and although the special effects
were incredible, I believe that the ensemble acting featuring Joe
Pantoliano, Carrie-Anne Moss, Laurence Fishburne, and of course...Hugo
Weaving(!) was the best part of the movie. This is a clear example of all
the cool elements of a great action movie coming together: the fighting,
the
training, and of course, guns...lots of guns. Anyway, if you haven't seen
this movie you have done yourself a great disservice and you need to go
out
NOW and rent it! I've shown you the door, it's up to you to open
it.
