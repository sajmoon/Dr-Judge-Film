Every few years comes a movie that will blow everyone away opening the
path
for a new breed of film.
This is one of them. The story, characters, character names and locations,
costume designs, soundtrack, direction are all so good they'll make you
wonder why they don't make more films of this caliber. Groundbreaking
philosophy on life. Are we all in the AMtrix? hmmm This movie breaks all
the
cinematic rules and re invents them in all ways you could possibly think
of.
Only problem with the soundtrack is that it didn't have the song
PUPPETMAN(lines of D) ahhahaha MORE ROCK IN THE SOUNDTRACKS PLEASE!!!
