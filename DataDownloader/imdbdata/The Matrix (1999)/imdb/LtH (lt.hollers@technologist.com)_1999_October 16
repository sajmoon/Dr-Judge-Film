Excellent, stunning effects, etc. Read all the other comments for details!
I
especially like the Street Fighter 2-style fight sequence between Morpheus
and Neo. It is choreographed very impressively.<br /><br />The soundtrack CD is superb, although I notice the American version is
edited, but the score CD is less impressive.<br /><br />And we do like Switch. Ohh, yes.
