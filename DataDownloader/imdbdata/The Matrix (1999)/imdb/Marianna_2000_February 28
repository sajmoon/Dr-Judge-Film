The Matrix might be the best science fiction film I have ever seen. The
story was a provocative exploration of reality that kept me riveted to the
screen with never a dull moment. It was cleverly executed with wonderous
special effects that weren't just a light show, not just dazzle, but a
spectacular addition to a world of incomprehensible impossibility. The
acting was only so so, but the storyline itself was so cool that even
average acting couldn't subract anything from the winning formula. It was
action packed and entertaining beyond most science fiction films out there
today. I am sure all the sci fi heads have seen it already, but, I would
recommend this film to anyone seeking adventure. If you love a roller
coaster, you will love The Matrix..have fun!  Wheeeeee
