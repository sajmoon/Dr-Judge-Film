People who are waiting in line for Star Wars are missing out on one of the
best movies of the year.  The Matrix is a must see!  In my opinion, I
think
The Matrix and Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace are very similar.
Anakin Skywalker has the force unusually strong with him (Star Wars) and
Neo
is supposedly &quot;the one.&quot; (The Matrix)  There's a lot of good force and bad
force in both these movies.  But, there is one thing that's different.
The
Matrix treats the audience as an intelligent group of people, having many
hidden facts in it for people to figure out themselves (i.e. names, etc.),
but The Phantom Menace explains &quot;everything&quot; as it goes along.  It treats
the audience as a group of brainless children.  Don't get me wrong here, I
loved both these movies, but if I had to choose the best out of the two,
it
would definitely be The Matrix.  Sorry Star Wars fans, but it's my choice!
NOT only that, but The Matrix is a kick-ass, action, thriller
rollercoaster
while The Phantom Menace is a mild, kind of thrilling,
joy-ride.
