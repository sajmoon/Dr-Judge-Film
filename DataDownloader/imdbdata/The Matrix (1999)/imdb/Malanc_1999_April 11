1999_April 11 

Besides The Matrix, I haven't seen a movie that does a good job of &quot;waking
you up&quot;.  The Matrix offers an answer in the form of an analogy to the
question:  Is there more to this life than the eye can see?  Besides being
dazzled by special fx and thrilled by funky-tune slow-motion action, I was
challenged by being asked where I stood on this planet.  Am I looking for
the truth and fighting to inform others about it, or am I indulging myself
and pretending that there may be nothing more than what I've been told.
This movie explores many things:  Belief, fate, faith, hope, fear, power,
etc.  It's all good stuff.  All these things were sort of brought together
and, at least for me were, one by one, made sense of.
