1999_November 6 

The premise of this movie was irresistible. The ultimate question of our
existence is always a delicious and chewy subject for philosophers. Most of
the film provided a satisfying meal, but dessert was a hail of bullets and
hackneyed dialogue. I must admit that Hollywood delivers what most people
want. I glanced around me during what I thought were the most riveting
conversational scenes, and saw a row of nodding heads. The machine gun
finale turned out to be an appropriate device to wake everyone
up.
