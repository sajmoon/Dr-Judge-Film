If you like a shoot-'em-up film with amazing martial arts and constant
action, then &quot;The Matrix&quot; is for you. If you're looking for an
edge-of-your-seat techo-thriller, bursting at the seams with the latest
special effects, then &quot;The Matrix&quot; is for you. I recommend the third-row.
And if you're in that small (but proud) group that wants something to get
the old brain saying &quot;What if...?&quot; then &quot;The Matrix&quot; is definitely for you.
&quot;The Matrix&quot; is deep enough for Descartes, but chock-full of enough
brain-candy to keep even the most distractible viewer glued to his seat.
Whatever your interests, &quot;The Matrix&quot; will having you talking and wondering
all the way home. A mix of new technology, old philosophy, and awesome
special effects makes &quot;The Matrix&quot; the best film I've seen in
years! <br /><br />
