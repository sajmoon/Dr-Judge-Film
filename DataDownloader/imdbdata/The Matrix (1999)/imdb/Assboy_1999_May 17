1999_May 17 

Now, I have to admit I have seen it 3 times, and would have to call it the
best comedy of the year, which is precisely what works in it.  Have you
seen
_The Big Hit_?  The action is similar: there's nothing like breakdancing
assassins.<br /><br />The truth is, however, that for as interesting as the plot was, they left
little to the imagination, and in fact, it seemed way too mainstreamed and
given in too many nice, chewable bite-sized snippets for the recreational
viewer.  For a hot concept like the world as a matrix, the fact that this
came as such a mainstream attempt may further prove the existence of the
story in our world.<br /><br />How about the campy, uninspired romance that we would have been better
served without?  How about insufficient fancy slow-mo FX?  How about more,
more, more in-the-matrix interactions?<br /><br />With all of this said, it was a riveting and compelling big-balls action
flick, and the best I've seen in the genre, but its failings show through
where the whole genre falls through: ditch action-flick conventions for
better swagger and ego.  If _The Matrix_ had more faith in itself, it
would
not be necessary to make such grandiose appeals to the common
viewer.
