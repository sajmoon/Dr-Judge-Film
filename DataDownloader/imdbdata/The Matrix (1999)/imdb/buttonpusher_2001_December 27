The best movie ever? Hardly.<br /><br />Just because Keanu looks so darn cool with the shades, trenchcoat, Bruce
Lee
moves and green beret arsenal, that doesn't mean you are watching a great
movie.<br /><br />Hey, it is fun to watch, but so is so garbage like Independence
Day.<br /><br />The story concept is one of the most ridiculous I have ever
seen.<br /><br />* Human batteries?<br /><br />* The matrix to keep comatose and atrophied bodies from
revolting?<br /><br />* The food chain of life somehow continues without sunlight?<br /><br />The kiddies who think that this is the greatest movie ever obviously slept
through their ninth grade biology classes, else they would know that these
are the dumbest concepts seen in science fiction since the bad b-movies of
the 1950's.<br /><br />The MTV generation needs a good slap upside the head.<br /><br />
