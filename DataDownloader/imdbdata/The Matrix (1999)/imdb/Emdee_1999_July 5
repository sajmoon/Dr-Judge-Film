1999_July 5 

The Matrix requires more than a temporary suspension of disbelief; it asks
you to take leave of your senses from the moment you sit down. Not only
are
the ideas cliched, crass and poorly synthesised but the entire film plays
like a badly seguered music video. It amazes me that a studio can justify
releasing a picture like this with anything but profit margin in mind. Yet
non-commercial, non-genetically modified human spiritualism is the central
message of the film.<br /><br />Shameless product placement (look out for the new Nokia advert starring -
yes, surprise, surprise - Keanu Reeves), poor casting and some completely
contradictory 'high concepts' make the film outstanding. Perhaps there is
a
cold intelligence in the mercenary conception of the film. If so, I have a
sinister feeling that the Matrix is the studio itself - 'reach into your
pocket and log on to the future; the parallel unreality'.<br /><br />The film is a sci-fi vehicle for Keanu Reeves to look cool in a wooden
sort of a
way.
