I didn't think much of this film.  The fighting sequences fell short of
being effective, and the special effects were glossy but not
inventive.
What? Is Canoe Reeves s'posed to be the Messiah or something?  Give me a
break.  I guess the only thing making this a movie worth watching is Joe
Pantoliano's performance as Cypher.
