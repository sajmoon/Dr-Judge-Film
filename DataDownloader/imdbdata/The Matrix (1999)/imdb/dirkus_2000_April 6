2000_April 6 

This is truly a great movie. Not only is the script faultless and well
thought-out, also the effects are superb and in perfect harmony with the
fine modern musical performance. For me it's one of those films that are
able to set a new standard or move a beacon, if you like. Looking forward
to
Matrix 2001
