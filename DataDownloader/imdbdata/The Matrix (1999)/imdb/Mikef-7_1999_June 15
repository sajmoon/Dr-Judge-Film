Matrix was a fun film with lots of cool action.  The premise of the film -
a
variation on Pascal's Methodological Solipsism - was interesting, if one
didn't look at the details too closely.<br /><br />The film's premise that the machines needed to keep human beings around to
generate heat was simply ludicrous.<br /><br />Terminator One also dealt with man vs. machine and did so much more
credibly.<br /><br />Still, despite the shaky premises upon which it was based it was still
worth seeing on the big screen.
