Oh yeah. Sure I could elaborate a hyper-massive review here, analyzing
every aspect of the movie in tremendous detail...but at this point in
time, I&#x27;ll merely settle for a quick, systematic justification for my
title up there.<br /><br />How could anyone claim that for any movie ? How pretentious am I to
impose this premise ? Everybody&#x27;s different, so no one movie could ever
be the goat...<br /><br />uhhhhh...wrong, but at least consider this:<br /><br />- Such a profound and multi-faceted metaphor about Life, existence. <br /><br />- Script, acting, settings, scene transition and sequencing, music are
simply paradigmatic for this style of dark, cyberpunk epic and cinema
in general.<br /><br />- Crescendos/build-ups are chilling to the bone, fighting/acting scenes
unique (not only is this film ahead of all others conceptually, but it
is also supremely brilliant visually - bullet time, a huge cinematic
technical innovation) + superb camera angles.<br /><br />- Classic myths/ideologies/religious transfiguration/philosophy:<br /><br />Man vs Machine; a post-apocalyptic dystopian future; Plato&#x27;s cavern
allegory; Kant&#x27;s phenomenon/noumenon (things as we see them/things as
they are); Jesus Christ and his super-human abilities/prophetic
fulfillment- myth and concept of the Oracle, Resurrection and
salutatory function; Judas, Betrayer; the Choice (blue and red pill
scene); Man mechanizing (think Neo&#x27;s metamorphosis and holes); and the
magnificent &#x22;Sleeping Beauty&#x22; theme, when in all hope fading, Love and
Destiny collide and bring the One to the Matrix. Also: the names,
Morpheus (Greek God of Sleep), Neo (anagram of &#x22;One&#x22;), Trinity...<br /><br />- Roughly all main genres in literature/cinema/art/story telling:
drama, action, humor, horror, psychological thriller, conceptual
piece....yes, all those, think deep.<br /><br />Personal note: all plots, sub-plots are easy to follow and digest, yet
the multi-layered nature of this opus will have you benefiting from a
few re-watches. Philosophically, this movie is mature, and deep; to not
be too complex for the viewing masses, not too clich&#xE9; and typically
Hollywood for the practicing partisans.<br /><br />Not to even mention this movie created an entire sub-culture, cult
following; &#x22;what is the Matrix&#x22; ?<br /><br />Thinking of how globally excellent, universally appealing, and
semantically general/generic this film is, only idiots could dis it and
no one with a logical brain and constructive, analytical tools would go
back to saying &#x22;quality is only in the eye of the beholder&#x22;.<br /><br />Convinced ? nope ? oh well...gave it a good shot.
