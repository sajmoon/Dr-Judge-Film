I heard so many great things about &quot;The Matrix&quot; that I had to see it.
Overall, I was impressed.  The special effects were astounding and the
movie
encourages the viewers to question reality.  My only complaint is that
Laurence Fishburne's character spent a great deal of time explaining
exactly
what the Matrix is.  I feel that these explanations got a little bit dry
after a while.  Still, the concept of the Matrix is so different from
reality that I suppose some explanations were necessary.  Overall, a good
film.  8/10.
