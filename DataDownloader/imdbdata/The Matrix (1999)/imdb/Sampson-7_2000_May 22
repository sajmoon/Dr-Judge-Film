A Philosopher who once thought that we were all just blobs being controlled
by someone or something else concluded that we really existed based upon
the
saying, &quot;I think, therefore I am.&quot; Without trying to give away too much of
the plot of this fascinating philosophical script, The Matrix interprets
life, and the world of Thomas A. Anderson (Neo) not too differently.
Combined with great fight scenes and special effects, the Matrix will
stretch your imagination and set the table for the sequel (coming in 2001).
Even if you don't like sci-fi, see The Matrix for its philosophy; It all
begins when Mr. Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is asked by Morpheus (Lawrence
Fishburne) which pill he would like to take? One reveals the truth, the
other and he can return to his bed and continue to live his life. This was
first proposed to us by Plato, with the analogy of the cave. If you like
action, if you like effects, if you like sci-fi, or if you like philosophy,
see the Matrix.
