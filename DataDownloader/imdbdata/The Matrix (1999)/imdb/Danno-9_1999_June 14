The Matrix is a good movie, no doubt. A lot of action, good camerawork,
great storyline. But what annoyed me was that the action scenes were made
almost the same as John Who (Face/Off) would have done it. More than half
of
the storyline comes directly from 'The Terminator (2)'.  Especially the
part where Keanu kicks the sunglasses of an agent's
head. Maybe the Wachowski brothers
also liked 'Highlander'.
