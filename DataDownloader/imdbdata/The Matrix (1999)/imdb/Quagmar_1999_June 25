1999_June 25 

I liked &quot;The Matrix&quot;. It is an escapist movie with cutting-edge special
effects. Does it deserve to be #20 on the IMDb's Top 250 list?
No.
Reading the comments made about this film made me wonder if &quot;The Matrix&quot;
really is that good...or is it the fact that Hollywood has been turning
out
such formulaic garbage recently that anything remotely fresh seems like a
classic work. Dwelling on that thought, it's probably a little bit of
both.
This movie does have the mythological and cultural elements to give it a
large cult following (the studios obviously recognize this since this is
becoming a three-part series now). But I feel people are too inclined to
worship the idea rather than examine the film. The concept of the
alternate
universe is spectacular, but the actual film is spotty. Anyone with common
sense can punch tractor-trailer-sized holes through the plot (my
girlfriend
made the best point: download as much martial arts into your brain as you
like, if your body isn't trained as well, it's not going to do you much
good...and why do they shoot that helicopter cannon into the room while
Moebius is tied to a chair, helpless???). The acting is adequate, but
forgettable. Still, this is a fun movie to watch (I laughed hard when
Fishburne whipped out the Duracell). It has a lot of elements going for
it,
and you won't be sorry you spent 5-10 bucks to see it. But #20? I don't
think so.
