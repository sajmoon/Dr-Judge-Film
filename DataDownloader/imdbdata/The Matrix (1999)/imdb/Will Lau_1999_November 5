1999_November 5 

Very Exciting! In a summer filled with Star Wars this movie held its own and
then some. Packed with breath taking visual effects and electrifying martial
arts sequences combined with an outstanding storyline The Matrix is where
movie making is headed in the next century. Lawrence Fishburne is the one to
watch out for in this. Although Keanu Reeves did a pretty good job I do not
expect too many praises from this performance. This movie has it all
though,(except for a love scene) I thorough enjoyed this
movie.
