1999_June 16 

Great depth in characters, EXCEPT for Neo who is most un-inspiring...the
character doesn't inspire sympathy, understanding, excitement or anything
(positive or negative) he's just there. He is the weakest part of the film
uplifted to the rank of 'Chosen One' - the only reason he was 'chosen' was
because it would increase box office takings by having the dead pan Keanu
Reeves playing it. But, and it is a BIG BUT, all the other characters are
brilliant. MORPHEUS is a superb caricature (I could follow that guy),
TRILOGY full of everything human and superhuman (I could fall in love with
this one), AGENT SMITH is spine shuddering (I'd run away). All brilliantly
acted great dialogue and expertly delivered, I would certainly go out of
my
way to see any of them again - unlike Reeves...snoringly, boringly banal -
they were all totally believable in an unbelievable film. I'd have given
it
10 if it wasn't for Neo, I wish he'd have taken the blue
pill!<br /><br />The story is fine borrowing loads of references from 'Alice in
Wonderland',
Japanese animation, pseudo religious themes and even Batman. The basic
theme
makes the imagination kick in to overdrive for long after the film making
it
great value for money as a simple flick. The story is full of gaps and
missing questions and answers, for instance what IS going on at Zion,
what's
it about, who's in charge and when is the sequel???<br /><br />SFX - uncompromising in their brilliance - great combination with the Kung
Fu - more like poetry than flashy nonsense.<br /><br />Worth seeing, but I reckon the spin offs are more interesting see the web
site though it's very contrived.<br /><br />There are no laughs, it's never that shocking and I didn't come out
feeling
better or worse - I wouldn't miss it if it wasn't there.
