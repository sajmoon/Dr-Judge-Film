1999_April 12 

With under two months until Star Wars and the unprecedented hype and
pageantry of what may be the biggest movie of all time, The Matrix has a
big
shadow to avoid.<br /><br />Yes, everyone knows the movie has great effects.  A sci-fi movie cannot
make
it today without them.  What most people may overlook from this movie,
amidst the stunning filming and some choice one liners, is that it may be
a
watermark in Hollywood.  I found the most intriguing aspect of the movie
was
the story.  It was intricate, thoughtful, and concise.  Some places it was
hard to understand what has happening, or more specifically, why it was
happening, but don't let it get you down.  It's all explained as you go.
This is a movie you HAVE to see at least twice.  It is just so much more
enjoyable to soak in the brilliance of a well written script.  It's
mystical
and technical.  It's retro and futuristic.  It's truly like nothing you've
seen before.
