1999_May 8 

It is currently May 7th, 1999, and today if you want to spend 6 bucks to
see
a movie you can either see The Matrix or crap.  (my opinoion anyway).
This
was a great film.  It had an unbelievable and original story, which is
rare
for a film driven greatly by special effects, and unlike most other sci-fi
films made lately (like Armageddon), The Matrix wasn't cheesy and poorly
thrown together.  It was complex, and I saw it a second time so I could
understand it better.  The acting was surprisingly good for what the film
required.  There was really only one thing that let me down, and that was
when Trinity in a Schwarzenegger fashion said &quot;Dodge this&quot; before shooting
the agent.  If you are being hunted by invincible computers, you're not
going
to be cool and calm enough to nonchelantly blurt out some witty one liner,
and up until that point I was totally sucked into the film, but I didn't
dwell on it, and it wasn't anything bad enough to ruin the film.
Definitely
Keanu Reeve's best to date, and the best thing I've seen in a theater of
quite some time.  9 of 10.
