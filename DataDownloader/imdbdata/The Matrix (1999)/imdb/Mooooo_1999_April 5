1999_April 5 

The Matrix kicked much a**.  This movie kicked so much a** that even Keanu
Reeves looked good.  Laurence Fishburne was, in his usual under-stated
way,
cool, and yet, effective.  Carrie-Ann Moss (Trinity) gave the movie a
reason
to watch, besides all the a**-kicking, of which she had no small
part.<br /><br />The highlight of the movie was when Neo wakes up from his combat training
session and blurts out, &quot;I know kung fu.&quot;<br /><br />Does anyone know what brand/where to find the sunglasses that Morpheus was
wearing?
