1999_June 30 

When I went to watch The Matrix I thought the special effects were going
to
be the selling point in the movie... gladly I was wrong. I found out to my
surprise that the story and the psychological emotional elements of the
story were profound and so thought provoking.
The Story (psychologically) you need to think!<br /><br />1) The actual idea and conception of the Matrix is really frightening to
the
extent that we begin to see that humans who create technology then are
enslaved by it(much better than Terminator 2 in storyline). This reminds
me
of our present situation where computers and genetic engineering is slowly
changing how we live in 1999. Science is slowly making us slaves and we
are
doing nothing about it, we don't even care or notice it but accept it as
progress. This movie is an early or late warning signal - will anyone take
notice?!<br /><br />2) This movie is about the bible and how Christ saves us from the demons
(the men in black with sunglasses). We see birth and incarnation,
prophecies
of the coming messiah and the search for this messiah. We see sacrificial
love and ultimate betrayal (Judas) and people in sin but do not realize
it.
The fact that many people miss this plot twist in the movie makes me feel
very very sad and proves that people are deluded and have not got a
working
or spiritual knowledge of the bible and what Christ did for humanity. The
bringing down of the divine to the enslaved earth. If these points do not
create any form of emotions I feel sorry for humanity in
general.<br /><br />Rating 10/10<br /><br />PS
If you liked this movie which makes you think,  also watch: Total
Recall(1990), The Usual Suspects(1995) and particularly Vertigo(1958) by
Alfred Hitchcock and ask yourself the question;  where do dreams and
nightmares start and end?
