Matrix may not be a critic's classic, but surely it does differentiates it
clearly from the typical action movie. If you think otherwise, I'd like to
challenge you to watch more closely.<br /><br />Two things I'd highlight in Matrix: 1) it's script, which is one of the
few
in movies to get the myth of the machine takeover and the possibilities of
'cyberworld' close to a real and clear plot (being a systems engineer, I
can
tell very few movies ever got near), 2) it is visually fantastic, and not
because of the now widely copied slow-motion kicks, but because it aids in
explaining the story and telling a lot of the double world you are
experiencing. Just like the 'half floor' in Being John Malkovich helps the
viewer accept the idea of the strange world the movie depicts, the high
contrast - highly iluminated scenery when entering the matrix reminds of a
3d simulation; the excess of gunfiring could easily be taken out of DOOM
games, and the slow-motion, multiple angle camera in action scenes reminds
that, at last this matrix is a virtual world, where one can really control
the evolution of the game.<br /><br />In summary, I'd say it is very worth watching over and over and
discovering
new things about it. As someone said here, after watching it, one cannot
help but think how much better all those expensive-budget Hollywood action
movies could have been.
