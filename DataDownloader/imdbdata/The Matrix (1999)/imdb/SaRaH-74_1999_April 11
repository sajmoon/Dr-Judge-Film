1999_April 11 

I am a self proclaimed hater of movie.  Especially the action Sci-Fi genre.
I paid my money expecting to hate The Matrix.  On the contrary, I loved it.
Brilliantly directed and surprisingly well acted, even Keanu Reeves, the
usual King of Monotone, was refreshing and good.  I am planning on seeing
this movie again.  soon.
