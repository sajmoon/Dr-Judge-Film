1999_March 10 

(As an avid film critic and reviewer, I got the chance to see this film
among other critics and lucky people in late Feburary.).<br /><br />Andy and Larry Wachowski have done it again. With their chilling, dark film
&quot;Bound&quot;, which they directed and written, I knew I was going to expect
another fantastic presentation. &quot;The Matrix&quot; completely blew me
away.<br /><br />I got the announcement about this film over three years ago, and I was
curious to see what &quot;The Matrix&quot; really was, but information was far too
limited, leaving me only the names of the people behind the magic. However,
it creeped up through the neighborhood and slapped me in the face, yelling,
&quot;Damnit! Look at me!&quot; Look at it I did, and I am stilling pondering about
&quot;The Matrix.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;The Matrix&quot; stars Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburn, Carrie-Ann Moss, and Joe
Pantoliano, among others. I have tracked Fishburn's acting career since his
infamous role on &quot;Pee Wee's Playhouse&quot; as &quot;Cowboy Curtis,&quot; and I must say, I
am amazed once again. Fishburn with the rest of the actors/actresses perform
stunningly, and leave you wanting more.<br /><br />But what is this Matrix I keep rambling on about? Well, as Fishburn states,
&quot;Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it
for yourself.&quot; That is exactly what you need to do to decipher &quot;The
Matrix.&quot;<br /><br />Although I promised myself not to let out too much information on this film,
I have permitted myself to blabber on about what this film has done. It has
done far past my expectations in technology. The slick movements by the
characters, and the martial arts are amazing. Obviously, a lot of work has
been put into this film, and work has done it good.<br /><br />Another point about this film that may be brought to your surprise. The
actual fight scenes, twirling about, action scenes, and so on, were
conducted by the actors themselves, not stuntmen, which also adds another
nice touch to realism. The training that the actors must have gone through
has to be appreciated from this film.<br /><br />Now, after viewing this film, you may decide, &quot;Oh jeez. I thought I was in
for something. This is just another Hollywood show-off of an old, repetitive
storyline.&quot; Well, may-be, but &quot;The Matrix&quot; has an insightful and nice touch
to its storyline. It brings it out in a unique way that no film has brought
before. That is why it stands out.<br /><br />&quot;The Matrix&quot; is a marvel among movies. This may not get an Oscar or two, but
it definitely stands out among other films. &quot;The Matrix&quot; cannot be explained
unless seen, so for you to discover the mystery behind &quot;The Matrix&quot;, you
have to see it, to believe it.
