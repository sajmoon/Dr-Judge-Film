i saw this movie BEFORE the hype, and it was just another movie. It didn't
shock me or effect me at all. sure, the special effects were cool, but the
plot was..well, recycled. i didn't get an original feel from it. The
acting
was VERY mediocre. Keanu Reeves is horrible, and will never be able to
carry
a movie. Carrie-Anne Moss and Laurence Fishburne were good.However, I'm
sick
of people LOVING this and saying it is the best PICTURE of 1999! if you
want
to see a REALLY good movie, go check out CROUCHING TIGER,HIDDEN DRAGON or
BILLY ELLIOT....<br /><br />5/10
