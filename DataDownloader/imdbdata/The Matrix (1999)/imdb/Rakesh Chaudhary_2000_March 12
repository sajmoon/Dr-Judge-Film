I am surprised that this movie has not got any recognition for its original
screenplay and for direction. For those people who say that the movie has
great special effects, I say that they have missed the whole point. Sure,
Starship Trooper had great special effects, but what makes the Matrix so
compelling is the plot and screenplay.<br /><br />The idea that we are living in a make-believe world, and not even aware of
it, is a fallout of the concept of Maya, or Illusion. I am surprised that a
two guys from the west could articulate this theory so well. This movie
works at a higher level, and those who get it will enjoy the movie much
more.
