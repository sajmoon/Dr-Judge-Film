'Frank? Larry here. How are you? Listen, Andy and I are writing a new
screenplay and we really want to sell this one. I'm thinking of writing
a sci-fi piece&#133;That's why I'm CALLING you, I was an English major and
everyone I know but you is an English major. My mother was a nurse,
that's the closest I've ever come to science. You're the only person we
know with any scientific education at all&#133;Well, we figure to sell, it
has to have computers, and it has to have VIOLENCE. We're thinking
about an eco-techno-cyberpunk-nuclear winter kind of thing with sequel
possibilities&#133;Well, something like Terminator meets 2001 meets WarGames
with some Johnny Mnemonic and Blade Runner thrown in&#133;It's, say, about
200 years from now, and the world has been laid waste and taken over by
advanced computers. WHY did they take over the world? Who cares?
Because they're bad! What? 'Colossus: The Forbin Project?' Never heard
of it. Look, it's just an evil computer, okay? I know computers have no
feelings, but it makes a good story&#133;because it does, that's all. <br /><br />So I have a question: If you had a worldwide computer network, how
would you power it?&#133;Huge farms of solar cells---talk about boring&#133;what
else?&#133;nuclear power plants&#133;what else?&#133;Look, what about electricity from
living things? I've been reading about lightning bugs, you know, how
they make that light with their bodies? Well, here's what I've been
thinking. The human body is the most efficient source of energy on the
planet, right?&#133;It isn't? It's an energy CONSUMER? Only about 12 percent
efficiency? Well, what about the human brain? It produces electricity,
right? Electrochemical? Is that different? And it's the most efficient
electricity producer on the planet, right?&#133;No? About the same as a
22-watt bulb? That's not very bright. What's that? Neither is my idea?
Come on, work with me here! Okay, so what would be an EFFICIENT way to
produce power for a worldwide computer network?&#133;Vast facilities
containing huge tanks filled with methane-producing bacteria that drive
gas turbines&#133;That may be EFFICIENT, but it's not EXCITING, Frank. You
can't make a MOVIE about that. How about vast facilities containing
HUMAN BEINGS who are all plugged into the Matrix&#133;that's our working
title, The Matrix. So they're all plugged into the Matrix because the
computers of the Matrix are using them as a power source in their quest
for control of the world&#133;AGAIN with the nitpicking about why? See,
we're thinking that the humans are kept in these vast hives of cells
of, like, amniotic fluid, hooked up to tubes that feed them and wires
that connect them to the Matrix&#133;They're fed a nutritious liquid. I
don't know where it comes from, or who produces it! I don't care and
neither will the audience! <br /><br />So the people spend their entire lives floating in these little
pods&#133;No, they don't exercise, they just float&#133;Atrophy? Osteoporosis?
How do they have babies? I don't know, special mating pods! You don't
have to be awake to produce semen; every teenage boy knows that. How
are they plugged into the Matrix? Wires, of course, you know,
implants&#133;I don't know who implants them---robots! It does seem pretty
far-fetched, but if I didn't think of those things, neither will an
audience&#133;Well, you see, they're all living in this imaginary virtual
world that the Matrix computers have designed to look just like real
life in the real world&#133;because the computers have found that the people
produce more electricity that way than if they're just asleep. Why? To
sell the screenplay, that's why! So I figure, if their MINDS think
they're exercising, their BODIES will think so, too. You know, it's
like if you dream you die, you really will die&#133;pseudoscientific
claptrap? No, what it is, is SHOWBIZ, Frank. But there is a small
population of humans who have disconnected themselves from the Matrix
and are alive and aware of the real world. They live in a secret city
called Zion and are trying to overthrow the Matrix. How did they get
disconnected? What do they eat if the world has been laid waste? Who
cares? So they're looking for The One, who is the human who will have
the power to control the Matrix instead of the other way around, and
they find him, a guy named Neo. They manage to unplug him from the
Matrix, and he awakens to the real world. It's really cool; we're going
to put in all sorts of metaphysical Zen stuff about reality versus
illusion and fate and stuff. Where did we learn about Zen? From our
massage therapist&#133;Neo joins them in their fight. How do they fight? No,
they don't blow up the main computer, that's the neat part: They fight
the Matrix in the VIRTUAL world. You see, they can plug back in to the
Matrix and so enter and leave the virtual world at will. So they fight
enemy COMPUTER PROGRAMS, not the physical computer. How? Get this: Lots
of way-cool balletic kung-fu stuff like Jackie Chan and lots of
balletic gunfights like Chow Yun-Fat, only computer-enhanced&#133;Lots of
mayhem from beginning to end. Why? Because it SELLS TICKETS, that's
why!&#133;The evil computers are looking for the rebels with machines in the
real world, too, and Neo manages to block the computers from destroying
the rebels in reality by fighting them in the virtual world&#133;Because
that's the way to plan for sequels, that's why&#133;Well thanks, Frank,
you've been really helpful. If we sell the screenplay and it gets
produced, we'll get you some free passes. Then you can see all your
great ideas on the screen.'
