2004_June 10 

I'm waiting, like a vulture, for this movie to become dated. And it
will. The club scene, the sunglasses, the fashions, the cell phones -
oh yes, one day it will all look and sound unbearably corny. And then,
we'll have to actually pay attention to the script and the acting (or
lack thereof). And we will realize that this movie reeks.<br /><br />For an action film, it's remarkably dull, with the first half basically
consisting of a looong string of complex explanations. It doesn't help
that Neo is a totally flat character. If I'm to care that he's trapped
in the Matrix, I need to see more of his life there. Sadly, one scene
of Neo at work, being berated by the boss, does not a fascinating
character make. I also think it was a terrible mistake to make him a
programmer, since he already understands the nature of computers and
should, therefore, be more receptive to the idea of the Matrix instead
of consistently incredulous. And am I supposed to believe that this
master hacker doesn't know what an EMP is?<br /><br />The film is also terribly derivative. Morpheus is an even more gaseous
version of Yoda, and Neo is clearly based on Luke (promising young man
discovers super-powers and helps rebels overthrow their nasty
oppressors). The visual style is ripped off from the Alien movies, as
is the snake-like parasite that somehow manages to burst through Neo's
bellybutton without leaving a mark. The evil agents clearly evoke The
X-Files, the notion that mankind is enslaved by robots in an
apocalyptic future comes straight out of The Terminator, and - most
damningly of all - the concept of a virtual reality environment called
the Matrix had featured some 23 years earlier in an episode of Doctor
Who (&quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot;). Maybe the Matrix didn't consciously rip
off all of these sources, but it's certainly worth noting that this
movie is utterly unoriginal in every respect but its action photography
(and that will, like all the rest, probably date badly).<br /><br />Needless to say, Reeves is pretty bland, and Fishbourne is just plain
embarrassing in his first scene (it doesn't help that his every dire
line is punctuated by a melodramatic bolt of lightning). Only
Carrie-Anne Moss's Trinity comes up smelling like a rose, and it's good
to see such a strong role for a female character - though I think she
should've been the hero, as she's got more charisma than everyone else
put together.<br /><br />I was quite disturbed by the metal detector scene, as it appears to be
nothing more than a particularly violent video game sequence that's
meant to inspire future generations of random crazy shooting maniacs.
It's worth mentioning that the security guards who are so callously
slaughtered by Neo and Trinity are not evil, just thralls of the
Matrix, like Neo had been merely days before. Why, therefore, does he
have no qualms about blowing them all to bits? Tacky, man - really
tacky.<br /><br />I enjoyed Joe Pantoliano's character, probably because he was allowed
to have an actual set of motivations and opinions, whereas the other
characters are just filler. And you know, a few segments were
effective; the Oracle has real presence. But the film is basically a
dog, and while it pretends to cast all kinds of light on the problems
with modern society, at the end of the day it's a stupid action movie
that raises interesting issues, then resolves them with ridiculously
OTT karate battles.<br /><br />As a movie, The Matrix is decent entertainment. As sci-fi, it's
derivative and sloppy. As philosophy, it's risible, misleading, and
poorly informed junk.
