Imagine you finally wake up from lifelong illusions and your
consciousness
is but a nightmare.
Imagine you don't wake up. Imagine you discover your mind is not
necessarily
yours.
Imagine artificial intelligence creates men and not the other way
round.
Imagine you realize all d&egrave;ja vu's and why you miss things you have never
seen.
Imagine the answer you have always been longing for is seeking you.<br /><br />Rethink power. Rethink freedom.
Mix Calder&oacute;n's freewill dream; Bob's &quot;Redemption Song&quot; and Blake's arrows
of
desire; Deckart's awareness; Dufresne's hammer, and Babette's salvation.<br /><br />You may be the chosen one... but only if you choose to be
it!
