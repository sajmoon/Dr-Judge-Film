1999_June 21 

At last an original idea.<br /><br />Did you ever imagine that we would see the likes of this from Hollywood? A
clever, witty, ORIGINAL script.<br /><br />Yes the effects are dazzling, yes it is a VERY cool film (go and buy the
long coats and sunglasses now!), but overall this is just a damn clever
film. It never takes itself too seriously, and twists and turns
unexpectedly, haven't had so much fun since the Usual Suspects
or...ohhh.... Vertigo?<br /><br />All the characters are wonderfully underplayed (whether on purpose or
not),
the visual effects will astound, the plot will turn your brain inside out,
and the script will have you thinking for weeks...<br /><br />Destined to be placed high in future Top 100s lists, see this film in the
cinema while you can. Whether you are an effects fan, you appreciate a
well
written storyline, or want to ponder the giddy heights of Zen philosophy,
use which ever guise you wish to see this film, but DO see
it.<br /><br />
