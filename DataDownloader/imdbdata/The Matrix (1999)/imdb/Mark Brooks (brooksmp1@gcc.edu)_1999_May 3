If you can imagine combining John Woo's cinematography, Jackie Chan's
choreography, and New Age epistemology you have The Matrix.  Neo, played
by
the surprisingly fitting Keanu Reeves, is about to discover the world in
which he lives is a lot less than it seems.  Chosen by Morpheus (Lawrence
Fishburne) he joins a group of rebels who know the truth and are beginning
to crack the code of our universe.  Dazzling effects, incredible camera
angles and slow motion shots depict these renegades as they learn how to
alter the physical parameters of the world around us.  A killer soundtrack
compliments the stunning visuals of this high energy techno
thriller.
