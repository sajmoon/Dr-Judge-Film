The Matrix is just awesome.  It's got a good plot too.  You might be a
little disappointed with the end, but I didn't have much of a problem with
it.  The special effects are amazing.  It's nice to see Keanu Reeves in a
good movie again.  Laurence Fishbourne is cool as usual as Morpheus.  Don't
analyze the plot too much.  Parts were dumb, but I didn't care.  I was too
excited too.  DO NOT WAIT UNTIL VIDEO, THE EFFECTS ARE TOO GREAT.  It would
lose a lot on video.  Just see it.
