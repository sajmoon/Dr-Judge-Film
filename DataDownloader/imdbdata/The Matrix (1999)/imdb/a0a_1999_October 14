You have to see it. I saw it 4 and a half times and I still can`t get
enough..when it`s out on dvd, I`ll buy it! Whatever people say, don`t take
their words for granted. If you want a lovestory, a good action movie, and
a
chance to look at the world from a different perspective, see this movie.
The movie has a very steady pace, keeps you surprised constantly, and all
the little details make perfect sense! It has been since Dances With Wolves
since a movie did fit so perfectly together.
