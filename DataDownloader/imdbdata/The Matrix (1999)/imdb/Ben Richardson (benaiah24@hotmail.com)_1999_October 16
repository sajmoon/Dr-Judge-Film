1999_October 16 

I read that Keanu Reeves only got his part in this movie because he told
the
Wachowskis his ideas on the philosophical angles of the 'Neo' character and
the script in general... At that was just what the directors needed to help
their pretensions of making something much more important than a movie and
they haven't done too bad a job.  The great thing is that they haven't
forgotten the need to be entertaining, too.<br /><br />The special effects are fantastic, the characterisations memorable
(especially Hugo Weaving's Mr Smith), and the action spectacular, but
sometimes the pacing drags a little bit.<br /><br />The story line is intriguing and definitely sets you thinking about the
greater implications of the story line (Christian parallels are many and
well-constructed).  I wonder, though, if the prequels/sequels that are
planned will end up adding to or subtracting from (see Phantom Menace) the
story so far constructed...
