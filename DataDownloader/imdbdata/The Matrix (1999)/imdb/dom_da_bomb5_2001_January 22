In my opinion, 'The Matrix' is the best film ever made. Combining
jaw-dropping special effects and superbly choreographed fight scenes, it
stands out clearly from today's finest productions. Excellent acting from
Laurence Fishburne and co. with ingenious scripting from the Wachowski
bros.
involves the viewer in a fantastic way. It's a great movie, but watch it
on
a big screen if you can! Cheers, Dom (14)
