Someone has finally found a forum for Mr. Reeves understated approach to
the
thespian craft: A great all around Sci-Fi/HK Action/SFX Tour de
Force!<br /><br />What brought me to the film in the first place was the promise of a decent
evening's diversion.  What kept me was a fine story, exceptional martial
arts choreography, and stunning production value.<br /><br />Contributing to the viewer's pleasure is an intelligent sense of camp
humor
and tongue in cheek reference to time-honored film archetypes, providing a
nice sense of balance with all of the over-the-top action.<br /><br />And as for Mr. Reeves, well, he grows on you - Finally!  Never thought
that
would happen...
