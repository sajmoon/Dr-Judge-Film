1999_October 13 

Some of the best visuals and editing in a film I have seen in a while.  I
expected a non-stop, action packed meaningless film before watching this
movie.  But after two viewings I got to realize how deep this movie really
is.  The biblical references were very interesting.  Keaunu Reeves
represented Jesus.  The plot, though confusing, was orignal and intriguing.
Cant wait for the sequels, may clear up some questions lingering in my
head.
