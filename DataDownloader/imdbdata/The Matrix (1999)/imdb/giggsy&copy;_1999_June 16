1999_June 16 

This is one of those films that you hear everyone in the media talking
about
for weeks before its release date and you think that they're hyping it up
because that is what they get paid to do. The reality is that they could
never do this film justice.<br /><br />If you walk into the cinema with an open mind you will be delighted when
you
walk out. The film is stunningly well made. You're left in awe of the
cinematography and the special effects - I know with each new film we
state
that the special effects are better then ever before - in this case they
are. However, this is not just a film about special effects. It
encompasses
a great storyline and an idea which is complicated enough to test the mind
but not too complicated so you lose interest because you cannot follow the
plot.<br /><br />What is the Matrix? You have to go and see for yourself - you'll kick
yourself if you only ever get to see this film on video - a cinema
&quot;must&quot;.
