The Matrix is the rare combination of plot, acting, special effects, and
action that appealed to me on a lot of different levels:  the whole
concept
of the &quot;Matrix&quot; made my head spin but didn't lose me, and the action
sequences were well executed and built on each other nicely.<br /><br />Lawrence Fishburn is warmly enigmatic, Kneau Reeves presents a nice
combination of confusion and cockiness, and I could have happily watched
Carrie-Anne Moss walk back and forth across the screen in her black outfit
for two hours.
