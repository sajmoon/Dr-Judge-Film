One hell of a movie, although I doubt most younger fans who seek the
roller-coaster disposable thrills like those in the Matrix will appreciate
the superiority of of better movies like &quot;Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon&quot;.
(Just look at some of the Matrix and Jackie Chan fan replies over
there.)<br /><br />Nonetheless, I would have given the Matrix a 10 instead of 9 except for the
very flimsy background premise regarding the matrix concept itself and the
&quot;human-battery&quot; concept. Come on, first of all, if sunlight is blocked out,
ALL life will die on earth. If not, then what's the point of harvesting
humans for energy? If there is no energy, than how the hell are humans going
to survive? What are the 'bots feeding them? Rocks? Give me a break. And
excuse me, all this aside, did anyone ever hear of muscle atrophy? I think
Keanu would have to spend months in therapy before he could walk to the
slop-kitchen after spending his entire life in a cocoon.<br /><br />Other than that, I though The Matrix was the most original and exciting film
since the original Terminator. But I think the Terminator had a much tighter
and well thought out background premise..
