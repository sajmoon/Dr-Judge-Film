This is a good movie, an enjoyable, clever, and visually interesting
movie.
Beyond that, it aspires to be philosophically engaging. Sci-fi really is
the
perfect genre to explore philosophy, because the rules of everyday life
and
experience can be suspended and the freshness of a situation can provide
an
excuse to explore inner as well as outer reality. This movie had the
philosophical themes of reality as a construct of group consciousness, the
role and fate of the initiates, the death and resurrection of the
enlightened one, and the capacity of the enlightened one to transform evil
from the inside out. I despair when reading all the &quot;reviews&quot; which are
oblivious of anything but a &quot;cool plot&quot; or &quot;great special effects&quot;. We
live
in the most philosophically moronic culture that has ever afflicted the
face
of the earth!
