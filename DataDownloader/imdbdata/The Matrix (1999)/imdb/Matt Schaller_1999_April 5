1999_April 5 

The Matrix explodes onto the screens in a way that is truly great.  The
movie takes ideas from The Terminator, Alice In Wonderland, Men In Black,
Kung Fu, Star Wars, Aliens, and Blade Runner.  The directors have taken the
key ideas from these movies, and have told a tale that has you second
guessing your own mortality and sense of reality.  Are we all just slaves of
a higher functioning system on this planet?  Will we (man) ultimately create
something that will ultimately destroy us?  If so, how can we combat a foe
we don't know exists?
While the end of this film undoubtedly sets up movies for the rest of the
series. The one thing that would do this new, and wonderful film franchise
justice is to take a page from George Lucas's book.  Do a couple sequels
that tell of the downfall of this heinous enemy.  Then, after that is
complete follow-up with a prequel that tells the audience how man got to be
in this situation.
The movie is a ride from start to finish.  While most people will go to
see The Matrix for its action.  The best part of the whole movie comes
about when Agent Smith is holding Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) captive in a
skyscraper.  Agent Smith talks about the way things are in the eyes of the
computer.  How we humans are just like viruses that go from area to area
infecting all that we touch.
The Matrix has a powerful message and is definitely the only movie 
worth seeing this year.  While it will not make &quot;Star Wars-Episode 1&quot; money.
The story is truly magnificant and probably the only movie people will
remember from this year, save one, Star Wars.<br /><br />
