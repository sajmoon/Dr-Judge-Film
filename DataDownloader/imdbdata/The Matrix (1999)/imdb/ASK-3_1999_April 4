1999_April 4 

I have to admit.  I had some doubt about this movie and was originally
expecting this flick to have glorified special effects and absolutely no
story whatsoever.  However, I was totally wrong.  The story was beautiful
and well-made!  The effects were not over-played, and were added to only
accentuate the mind-blowing narrative.  The action was stupendous with its
attempt at making realistic anime-style fighting sequences.  The characters
were also memorable and fun.  And this movie makes you think about our
precepts and perception of reality.  Truly, one of my favorite original
sci-fi flicks!
