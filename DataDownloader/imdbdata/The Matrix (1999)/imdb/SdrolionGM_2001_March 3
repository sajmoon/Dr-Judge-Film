The Matrix...when I first heard about it, I expected just another sci-fi
action thriller.  Good and filled with insane stunts, but not terribly
intelligent.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong.  Oh, the stunts are there in spades, all right, and yes,
they are awesome.  And the special effects are absolutely amazing (even if
similar ones have been used in other movies as a result- and not explained
as well).<br /><br />But the movie has plot as well.  It has characters that I cared about.  From
Keanu Reeves' excellent portrayal of Neo, the man trying to come to grips
with his own identity, to Lawrence Fishburne's mysterious Morpheus, and even
the creepy Agents, everyone does a stellar job of making their characters
more than just the usual action &quot;hero that kicks butt&quot; and &quot;cannon fodder&quot;
roles.  I cared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the
villains with a passion.  It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and
behold, a plot does help the fight scenes!  Just try it, if you haven't seen
the movie before.  Watch one of the fight scenes.  Then watch the whole
movie.  There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the
scenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put together
is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the
theaters.  Think about it next time you're watching one of the more
brainless action flicks...think how much better it COULD be.<br /><br />All I can say is WATCH THIS MOVIE.  If you haven't, you're missing out on
one of the best films of all time.  It isn't just special effects,
folks.
