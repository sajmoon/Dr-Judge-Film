1999_December 29 

i liked this flick a great deal (especially the fight scenes) but felt
that
the movie was about 20 minutes too long. a little tighter editing at the
beginning would have quickened the pace nicely in my opinion. being of big
fan of the wachowski brother's previous film BOUND, i find it great that
hollywood has embraced them without making them compromise their unique
cinematic visions. looking forward to the matrix 2!
