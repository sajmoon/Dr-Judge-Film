1999_April 4 

The movie starts off with a cool action sequence, and it gets you interested
right away.  The movie is very interesting, and keeps the viewer wanting
more.  The middle gets pretty slow, or confusing, as they try to explain
what The Matrix is and how it works (later on, you come to understand it
pretty well).  The last hour or so absolutely blows you away, with some of
the greatest action sequences/special effects ever filmed, and its a hell of
a thrill ride.  All in all, this movie is a little over long, but it is
undeniably worth seeing because of the great action scenes and stunning
special effects.
