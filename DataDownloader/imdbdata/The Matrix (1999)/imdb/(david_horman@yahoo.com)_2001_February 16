I'd never wanted to walk out of a film before the end until I'd seen the
Matrix (and I've seen Teen Wolf Too), and I'm still bemused to this day as
to why everyone was so fascinated by it.  The plot and plot devices are
hardly original (Dark City, The Thirteenth Floor), and fans of Doctor Who
will remember the Time Lords' computer generated pseudo-reality called the
Matrix, back in the 1970s.<br /><br />Everyone marvels at the &quot;bullet time&quot; action scenes.  I always thought it
was called slow motion, and had been around quite a while (just watch any
John Woo movie) but maybe I'm mistaken.<br /><br />Then there's the plot holes.  I won't go into details, and I'm sure Matrix
fans have a comeback for each and every argument, even if it's just that i
should suspend my disbelief - don't get me wrong, I love a lot of films
that
require a degree of that, but it's usually cleverly done, not just thrown
together out of a bunch of ideas any 12-year-old with an active
imagination
could come up with.<br /><br />I couldn't even care about the characters, flat as they were.  We all know
Keanu Reeves can't act his way out of a paper bag, but we should be
thankful
that at least he made the others look good.  Overall The Matrix is just a
blind action movie, with a flimsy sci-fi cover, and with The Sixth Sense,
that makes four hours of my life I could have better used
asleep.
