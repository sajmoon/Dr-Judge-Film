1999_May 11 

After all the hype, I expected something dreadful, like 'Independence
Day',
but found myself enjoying every minute of this movie.<br /><br />Like most reviewers I found the visual effects astonishing and only
slightly
overdone. This was complemented by a great soundtrack (loved the gunfight
to
'Propellerheads'), and the cast were adequate (though character
development
was pretty sketchy.)<br /><br />There were minor inconsistencies in the rules of the Matrix - but hey,
this
is a work of fiction (I hope), call it artistic licence, and overall the
thing hung together remarkably well. There were many religious themes
(resurrection, Messiah, Last
Supper, (complete with Judas) even Baptism) but they weren't
intrusive.<br /><br />My only reservation was the gun-associated violence (Neo: &quot;Guns... Lots of
guns...&quot;) There were about two dozen people shot dead by the GOOD guys,
mostly innocents (cops/military following orders), and just at the moment
gun-toting people in black trenchcoats seems to be an unpopular
image.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie so much I went back with some friends, and will be
buying the DVD when it comes.
