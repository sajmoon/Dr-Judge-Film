1999_April 4 

This movie separated all of the action movies to date. You don't usually see
Keanu Reeves in such a film, but I enjoyed this movie more than any Bruce
Willis, or Arnold Schwarzanegger flick, because this movie actually had a
plot.
Set in a futuristic mode, Reeves finds himself as a hacker, named Neo. The
movie is fast paced, and a little technical, but not too technical for those
watching. Filmed in Australia with contributions from Hugo Weaving as well
as Matt Doran who plays Mouse, shows the world at another angle. The Matrix,
lets us see the truth, but leaves us hanging for more. Definitely the best
movie I have seen all year.
