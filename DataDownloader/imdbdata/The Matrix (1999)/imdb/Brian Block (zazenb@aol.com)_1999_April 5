1999_April 5 

Better than T2, as good as Apocalypse Now, better than Dark City.  I have
now seen it twice and will surely see it again in the theatre at least one
more time.  I was fully entertained, no boring parts.  The music was
perfectly selected.  This movie makes my top 10 list easily.  The effects,
while cutting-edge, are not superior to the plot, the style, the
cinematography, or the action scenes. Oodles of scenes that will make you
say &quot;How the hell did they film THAT!?&quot;  If you like martial arts, this is
simply tantalizing.  If you like existentialism, this movie will more than
satisfy.  If you are into hard-core whoop-a** action, few better movies
exist.  This movie is so well made, I felt that my ticket price was so
cheap, I would pay to see it 5 more times and feel like I got a bargain.
The few conceptual flaws, which I root out of every movie, are
inconsequential and detract nothing from the flick.  Keanu's agent should
get a huge raise, for he could have done nothing better to redeem Keanu's
reputation.  Keanu's typical dead-pan and poor acting are actually ideal
for
this role.  If there is one non-X-rated movie I would have liked to be a
part of, this is it.  Go and see this with a diaper on!
