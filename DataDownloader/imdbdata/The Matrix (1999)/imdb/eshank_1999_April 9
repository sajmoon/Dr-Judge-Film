1999_April 9 

We usually judge media by its presentation... this movie goes beyond
presentation to manipulate the viewers perception.  Many movies do that to
some extent (usually via the soundtrack), but this film takes the
manipulation of perception to new heights.  Its almost a &quot;ride&quot; more than
a
movie.<br /><br />For several hours after I left this movie my sense of time felt much
faster.
I felt highly alert, my movements were precise and my thinking sharp...
like drinking lots of coffee but without the jitters.  I almost believed I
could exist outside of time...  fascinating and dangerous.  Be very
careful
driving home after this movie, or better yet, have someone else pick you
up.
