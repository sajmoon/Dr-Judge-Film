1999_April 13 

I have to wonder about the point of these here pico-reviews, since obviously
they are skewed towards the kind of people who loved the film enough to take
the trouble. Well, I didn't like it, and here's why.<br /><br />The profound matter of &quot;what is reality?&quot;, supposedly the film's underlying
theme, is rather superficially treated. Don't expect your mind to be blown
unless the thought &quot;reality is just the way we interpret electrical signals
in our brain&quot; is bizarre and new to you.<br /><br />Keanu has been given the thumbs up for playing a dazed and confused
character so well - I kind of agree, except playing a dazed character is
neither interesting or challenging. The lead character in this film is dull
as dishwater, Hugo Weaving's Agent definitely steals the show. Fishburn was
quite cool, although the way his character was set up I was a bit
disappointed he was actually a tall black dude with sunglasses (exactly like
you'd expect) and not an old Vietnamese woman with arthritis, which would
really surprise you.<br /><br />However, my main issue is with the film's plot - it has plot holes so large
Hannibal could drive his army through them. The future portrayed is
mind-numbingly unoriginal, and the rationale for the existence of the Matrix
itself is simply laughable; it's just patently ridiculous. (I feel so
dirty.) The way in which the characters interact with &quot;reality&quot; and &quot;the
Matrix&quot; is necessary to drive the plot, which I might liken to a new volvo;
shiny and with computers in it, but still the same old boring car as they
made 10 or 20 years ago. This interaction is, alas, stupid and nonsensical.
Suspension of disbelief is easy to achieve in a movie with great acting or
plot, but here, I tried and failed.<br /><br />On the up side, the combat sequences were amusing, the effects were OK -
quite average for 1999, which is to say, pretty amazing. Weaving and his
cohorts were cool, and until you actually find out what is going on, the
plot is somewhat intriguing.<br /><br />This film is a Hollywood-made, Keanu Reeves-starring cyberpunk movie. You
get what you expect - as long as you haven't read the other reviews.
