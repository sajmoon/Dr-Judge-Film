The Matrix is the greatest movie ever! If you haven't seen the movie yet,
and you like computers, technology, and science fiction, then BUY this
movie
today! Though at the moment this movie is science fiction, some of you
might
agree with me that it may not be in a few years! &quot;I want guns, lots of
guns&quot;.<br /><br />The Matrix also has a huge amount of symbolism. The first few times you
watch it you may only notice some of it if any, but after lots of times of
watching it you'll start to notice more and more, but don't expect to ever
notice it all, for you never will.
I can't wait for 2 and 3 to come out! I hope they're as good or better than
this one! I wonder if Neo will ever succeed. I hope he does. NEO IS THE
ONE.
OF COURSE HE WILL SUCCEED.
