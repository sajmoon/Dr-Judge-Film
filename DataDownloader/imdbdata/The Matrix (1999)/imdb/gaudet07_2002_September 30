Guess what i did last night!!! i watched that martix and i realized that
what i was watching closely resembled the story of jesus. i believe that
the
main comparison in this movie is when Neo is told that he is the one. and
we
all know that the bible says Jesus is the one. now i myself an a
christian
and looking for comparisons in this film kinda ruined it for me. i like
the
matrix movie and i now watch it for what it is and i try not to think
about
comparisons.i am sure that the directors of this movie filled it with
these
parallels just so they could get people like me  thinkin about it and
critiquing the film.
