1999_April 29 

Keanu Reeves could have been replaced, but the supporting cast was
awesome.
The camera work was second to none.  The grafix, lets just say, too bad it
had to come out the same year as Phantom Menace.  The music was
surprisingly
fitting.  The idea behind the &quot;Matrix&quot; being a dream world, yadda yadda
yadda was imaginative, but the story line to the movie didn't go anywhere.
Seeing the second and third time, I actually noticed more and more, and it
actually adds more to the movie.  For anyone who's seen it once and
enjoyed
it, I recommend watching it a second time.  Third?  I dont know about that
one, but only rent/buy it if you have a nice home system.
