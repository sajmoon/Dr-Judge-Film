1999_June 4 

What a thrill ride!<br /><br />Like a Playstation game on amphetamine, a science-fiction fashion shoot,
and
a 101 Philosophy lesson at MIT.<br /><br />Keanu is Neo - the hacker.  He's a
much more believable hero - average, not clever, not sure of himself, but
determined and honest.<br /><br />Strong and appropriately tight-lipped supporting cast, but what really
shines are the effects.  Originally, throbbing and left-field - this stuff
could only have come out of the minds of the Southern Hemisphere.
Hollywood
heads are bone-dry.<br /><br />Stupid dialogue, but who needs it - this is the real world, where people
ain't clever but they care.  Cool concept portrayed with fun, flair and
style.<br /><br />Stomping!
