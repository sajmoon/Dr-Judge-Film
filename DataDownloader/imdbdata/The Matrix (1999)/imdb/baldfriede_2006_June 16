The Matrix is nothing but a cheap and effect overladen copy of Rainer
Werner Fassbinder&#39;s excellent TV-movie &quot;Welt am Draht&quot;, which was
broadcast in 1973. Typical Hollywood overblown style, where they think
FXs are everything. The Fassbinder movie hardly uses any effects at
all, but is ten times as intelligent and a hundred times more
enjoyable. Yach! Sorry, brothers Wachowski, have a look at the
Fassbinder movie again and learn that less is more. Some people like
this kind of action; for me it ruins a movie completely. I was still a
kid when I saw that Fassbinder movie, and I would like to see it again;
but their are some legal problems about the rights to this movie, and
it can&#39;t be broadcast at the moment.
