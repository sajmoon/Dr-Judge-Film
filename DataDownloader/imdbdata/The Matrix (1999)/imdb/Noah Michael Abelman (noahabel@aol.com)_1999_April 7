1999_April 7 

This film may, depending on the true nature of Stars Wars Episode I, be a
benchmark for science fiction.  The brothers Wachowski have created a
concept far beyond the imagination of most movie audiences.  I was in awe
throughout the film and left feeling as though my dreams were not
adequately
creative enough to compete with the word of The Matrix.  The film makers
were able to conceive visually those aspects of comic books and science
fiction literature that have escaped film thus far.  The closest films
that
have come to this complete visual and conceptual realization might be
Blade
Runner and Dark City.  For anyone who is interested in thinking about
things
they never imagined and seeing things they never thought possible, look no
further than The Matrix.  (WARNING: Stars Wars fans beware of possible
disappointment in Episode I if you do.)
