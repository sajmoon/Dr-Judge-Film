I was a little unsure when voting the full 10, knowing that there's at
least
another two films on the way?  What if they're better - what would I give
them?<br /><br />They'll have to be really good though, to beat The Matrix.  This film is
science-fiction at it's best - action packed, but intelligent.  When
someone
says sci-fi , people associate nerds and geeks, but this film blew that
away, gripping just about everyone. I don't know a single person who didn't
like it!<br /><br />The fight scenes are superb, pushing boundaries with technology, while it
allows itself to be quite fascinating with it's attempt to parallel the
Human race... with a simple virus, eating up its resources.<br /><br />This is a must for anyone, surely! Roll on the sequels!
