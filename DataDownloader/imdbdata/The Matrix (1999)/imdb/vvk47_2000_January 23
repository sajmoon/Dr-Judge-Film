So,goodfellas,You really think &quot;The Matrix&quot; rules? Don't try
to
impress me.Because there's the one and only martial art which always
wins:AIKIDO.I'm sure &quot;karate&quot; showed us in the movie
is the hardest way to protect &quot;Neo&quot; and his &quot;Trinity&quot;.Why did they spend a
lot of money trying to make fight scenes more natural?..they still look
unreal!And even a 12-years boy feels
fake in this &quot;greatest(?)&quot; movie.The Wachowski Bros should
ask
Steven Seagal to help...Because you should not bend - you should dodge the
bullets.And you shouldn't make thousands of kicks - you just can turn,step
in and break his hand.
According to this I gave 6 of 10.Guys,If you're gonna make
a
sequel,be smarter!
