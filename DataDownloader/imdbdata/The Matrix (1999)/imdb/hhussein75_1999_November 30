The Matrix was the best movie I have ever seen. I gave it a 10/10. If you
haven't seen it yet, I suggest you see it now. The acting in it was
incredible and the effects were outrageous. It is a definite MUST SEE!!!!
The producers and those people picked the right actors I don't know of
anyone who could have acted out &quot;Neo&quot; better than Keanu Reeves. THE MATRIX
WAS WITH NO DOUBT MOVIE OF THE YEAR!!!!
