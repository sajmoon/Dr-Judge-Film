It was always hard for me to comment movies... they are all about feelings
so, is there a way to explain them by words? In my opinion,
NO!
When i first saw it i was completly amazed by the junction of a great
visual, script, acting... it was just to good to be true! I'll try to
explain better what i'm trying to say! My all time favourite film is &quot;Lost
highway&quot; from director David Lynch. Its like you can't say it's a film for
everyone... by the contrary, it's hard to accept due to it's complexity.
Matrix is a &quot;good&quot; film and acceptable to anyone who enjoys a good time
and,
at the same time, for the ones who search &quot;something more&quot;!
One of the best ever... 10/10, very well deserved...
