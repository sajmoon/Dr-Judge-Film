1999_September 18 

This is a must see movie.
The plot i think has been used before, but i don't know where (i just had a
&quot;Deja-vu&quot; feeling throughout the movie!!!!).
The plot is a bit thin, but the pace, actors (male &amp; female), and special
effects make you forget this. It is a rollercoaster from start to
finish.
One for my collection.<br /><br />8/10 (it would have been a 10 but for the thin plot)
