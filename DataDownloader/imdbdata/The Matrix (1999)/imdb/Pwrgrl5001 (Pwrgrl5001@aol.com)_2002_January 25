OMG, this is the COOLEST movie.  i just saw it today, i know it's been out
a
while, but i thought &quot;o, great, another sci-fi flick with a pretty-boy in
the lead role&quot; geeze, was i wrong.  it's an excellently written movie, and
even if Keanu Reeves sometimes falls short in his acting, Carrie-Anne
Moss,
Larence Fishburne(or whatever), and Hugo Weaving do a wonderful job of
covering it up.  i highly reccomend this movie to anyone who enjoys plenty
of surprise twists and turns along the hero's quest as opposed to the
obvious ending to the movie.  it's great, you should all go see
it!
