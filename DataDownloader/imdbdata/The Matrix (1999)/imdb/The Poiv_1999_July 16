Well, so I went and saw the Matrix.
I prepared for a dose of action and jokes that is the normal outcome of a
normal US movie.  I got that.  But, to my surprise (and joy) there was some
other stuff in the movie?  Effects, plot, script and more effects...<br /><br />The effects strictly dominate the movie (how about Keanu Reeves flying as
superman and stopping bullets with his hands) but there is some real action
too.  Still, the plot is similar to Terminator - but is much better.<br /><br />So the outcome of it: Massive, action spawned movie with effects that'll get
you to believe you've landed on Mars with a pair of 3D glasses.  Good fun.
Rates 9/10 or +++ 1/2 of ++++.
