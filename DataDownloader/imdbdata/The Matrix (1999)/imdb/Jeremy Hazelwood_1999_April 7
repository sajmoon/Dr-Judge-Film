1999_April 7 

This is the best movie I have ever seen.  Hands down.  I have a lot of old
favorites, and it takes a lot for a new movie to even come close to
displacing them, but Matrix blew them all away.  If you like the &quot;what is
reality&quot; aspect of Total Recall, this is for you.  Matrix has a couple of
other references to other movies, but I don't want to spoil it.  This was
the perfect role for Keanu Reeves, and for those of you like me that have
been disappointed in some of his past movies, this is fully redeeming.  A
great cast of characters, a strong plot, and a smoothy flowing storyline
insure that you never get bored.  In fact, I'd say it was the fastest 2
1/2
hours of my life.  The special effects are top notch, but not overdone.
You
become fully immersed in Matrix and it is truly exhilarating.  Personally,
I
don't get that much of a thrill off of roller coasters.  Overall, an
&quot;A+&quot;.
