I love good Sci-Fi. Trouble is, to be really good Sci-Fi, it has to be
original...something to make you think. It should make you wonder, &quot;Could
this happen?&quot; The Matrix is such a movie.<br /><br />All too often these days, directors rely on dazzling special effects to
carry a plot with no interest to anyone. Well, this movie has all the
dazzle, as well as sizzling performances by all the cast. But the
highlight
to me was the plot...slowly pulling you in, detail by detail, until you
are
totally consumed. Pure entertainment!<br /><br />If your a real Sci-Fi fan, you'll love &quot;The Matrix&quot;. If not, you'll
probably
wonder what all the fuss is about.
