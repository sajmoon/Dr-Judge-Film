I saw this in theaters when it came out, and it was what I expected: a
movie
with lots of special effects-enhanced gunplay and exploding things. A lot
of
people have dismissed it as not being sufficiently serious sci fi, or
lacking character development. I'm suprised anyone expected either. If you
haven't seen the movie, prepare for nonstop eye candy, stylish violence,
and
a fair amount of humor. Whether or not that's enough is personal
preference.
Personally, I was entertained enough to have watched it a few times
since.
