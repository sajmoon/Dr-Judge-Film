What is the Matrix? Well go and see, hear and feel it for your self. Not
on
a small screen, but on the big screen. It`s not worth to be looking at
otherwise.<br /><br />The first thing I said to my self after the movie was: &quot;Wow. I just hope
they would make a sequel&quot;. Why???? Because there is so many unanswered
questions.<br /><br />Maybe they just should keep it with one movie? Maybe the meaning with the
movie is to keep us wondering? I don`t know... Go and find it out for your
self... Good luck!!!
