Well, this movie was really enjoyable, I really liked it. The effects were
cool, the plot something new and the whole thing just impressive. Just one
thing that really annoyed me: The rating. My god, the rating!! IMDb gives
&quot;The Matrix&quot; a 8.6 with 42.6% &quot;10s&quot; and in the Top 250 it is on place #28!
My god, that can't be true - it was a good movie, but I've seen lots of
movies that were better, not just 27!
