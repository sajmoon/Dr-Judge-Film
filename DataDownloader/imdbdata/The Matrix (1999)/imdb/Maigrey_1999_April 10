1999_April 10 

Though the plot was vaguely reminiscent of other recent sci-fi movies,
overall the movie was excellent.  Keanu Reeves delivered a strong
performance, and the supporting cast was great as well.  Even if it wasn't
for all these things, the movie would be worth seeing just for the special
effects alone.  This is a movie you truly need to see on the big screen to
appreciate.  And as a bonus, it also has the Star Wars trailer :)  For all
these reasons, The Matrix is a movie I strongly recommend.
