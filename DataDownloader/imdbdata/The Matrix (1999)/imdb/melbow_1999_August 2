The Wachowski Brothers (screenwriters-directors of the compelling lesbian
noir Bound) provide an innovative and fascinating sci-fi
thriller.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves plays Neo, a computer hacker who &quot;wakes up&quot; from his dream of
reality into the horrifying real world of the future, discovering that the
world is actually a virtual reality computer game.<br /><br />The powerful, intelligent screenplay and the generous dose of
ground-breaking &quot;flo-mo&quot; effects make it irresistible. It elegantly mixes
action, sci-fi and kungfu with a structure that in many ways follows Star
Wars. The plot is tight and stimulating and builds to a satisfying, strong
climax.<br /><br />Like in Bound Bill Pope delivers a dark appealing cinematography with a
sober use of colours, wrapping in The Matrix in an obscure, exquisite cover.
The great cast, including the ravishing newcomer Carrie-Ann Moss and the
Australian star Hugo Weaving, grace the brothers flawless direction and make
it a thoroughly entertaining watch. The Matrix will no doubt be followed
with several copy-cats.<br /><br />
