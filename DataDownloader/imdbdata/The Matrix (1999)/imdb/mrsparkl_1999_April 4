1999_April 4 

I've noticed that a lot of the critics out there have put-down the Matrix as
incomprehensible or illogical but that's because they're idiots.  They
simply don't understand the movie and went into critic attack mode by using
artsy fartsy terms to try and hide their lack of technical sophistication.
The Matrix's plot is entirely consistent internally and only requires some
attention to follow.  I won't reveal the plot since part of the fun of the
movie is figuring out what will develop.<br /><br />The action is startlingly fresh and energetic.  Of course the action isn't
entirely original (it's not like there are that many kill people) but the
way the effects, perspectives and different styles are put to use in this
movie hasn't been done before.  Hong Kong wire fighting and John Woo style
shoot-outs done in bullet-time with morphing thrown in are possible in the
Matrix because the rules of that simulated world allow it (see critics
what's so hard to understand about that?).  I won't say that the plot is
wholly original but it helps explain the action and bring on the next fight
sequence.  Besides, any script that finally provides a credible and funny
explanation as to why so many things taste like chicken isn't all
bad.<br /><br />The movie kicks ass (literally and figuratively); you'll enjoy it fully if
if you aren't looking for something like the Piano or other art BS.  Don't
let morons that don't get the movie tell you otherwise.
