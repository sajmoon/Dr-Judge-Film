1999_June 19 

The idea of an outer and hidden world has walking the human mind for years
even centuries. The Wachowski brothers just show a new vision of the old,
very old philosophical discussion about the difference between the world
we
feel and real world outside. That vision is logically located in our
actual
world rounded by computers and the fact of networked silicon
&quot;minds&quot;.
The film technically is at the best of breed, with good special effects
and
excelent sound effects, but some times the acting work fail to reach the
level of the other components.
The Wachowski brothers should give some credits to The Gospels writers,
after all, Neo remember me some messiah two thousands years
ago.
See it, is a Delicious and Inspired sci-fi film
