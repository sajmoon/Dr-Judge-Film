1999_April 20 

The digital special effects in this movie are amazing, and nearly make it
worthwhile.  However, not being one who just &quot;eats up&quot; a movie, I had some
problems with this movie's &quot;plot theory&quot; as I like to call it.  For
instance, does the tactic of fighting the matrix on its own turf really make
sense, bearing in mind a horrific physical war in the real world will
inevitably have to ensue?
Are we to believe that a ship is constantly cruising throughout the sewer
system?  There are several times when the agents exhibit vast amounts of
strength, and deadly sharpshooting skills, but yet they fail in several
instances to kill the main characters when at close range.  This is
propensity is like the T2 in Judgement Day who has the opportunity several
times to kill the young Jon Connor at close range, but fails to do
so.
When Cipher kills the crew one at a time, it seems unbelievable.  Hadn't the
crew, along with Keanau Reeves, while in training, been yanked out of the
virtual world before?  What would pulling the plug have done that hadn't
already been done to them before?<br /><br />If the matrix can help one achieve his or her goals, dreams, potential,
strengths, etc, and can be mastered, harnessed, and honed, like the force,
why can't the characters (or the Agents for that matter) have more
superstrength, superspeed, shape shifting capabilities?  They seem awfully
limited despite being so powerful.<br /><br />The biggest problem I had with this movie was the ending.  In the mind of the theatre goer,
nothing has been solved.  This sets the film up for a follow up sequel,
which I would not pay to see, rather I would wait for the Matrix 2 to appear
on video.
