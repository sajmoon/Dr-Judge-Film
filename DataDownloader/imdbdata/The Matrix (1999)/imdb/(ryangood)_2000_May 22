Wow! What can I say? Well first, I have never seen such terrific special
effects. It literally astounded me! Who would of thought that any person
was
capable of doing those special effects? The Wachowski Brothers! I AM
looking
forward for more breath - taking movies from them in the future.
Especially
the 2nd and 3rd sequels! It has got a terrific plot, too. And my
definition
of a terrific plot is one where you need to see the movie again just to
figure it out. Those types of movies are what gets people going back to it
again. I guarantee you this movie is one of them! Laurence Fishburne is
phenomenal! He is perfect for the role as Morpheus! He makes you think
about
what he says and it may sound very confusing the first time you see it,
but
if you see it again, you will get more and more of what the movie AND what
Laurence says. Keanu Reeves is great too as the unsuspecting person
doesn't
know what sort of surprises and troubles he gets into. And all the rest of
the characters, I don't even want to go through on how great they are!
This
is truly the &quot;movie of the future!!!!!!!!!&quot;
