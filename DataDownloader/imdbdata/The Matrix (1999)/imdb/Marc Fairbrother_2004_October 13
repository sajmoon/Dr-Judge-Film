The Matrix took everybody by surprise back in 1999 but after the
initial euphoria there was very little left to say about this movie
which is, I believe, way over-rated. True, the special effects had a
new look but that's pretty much all there is to it. Now those SFX are
clich&eacute; and close to ridiculous. Look at Terminator II, now over twelve
years old, the SFX are still ahead of today's standards.<br /><br />The story is basically a cross-over between the Terminator plot (also
Blade Runner and a lot more sci-fi movies with the mankind overrun by
machine and artificial intelligence idea) and the Dark City setting and
ambiance (trench coats, an artificial city). This lack of originality
is why, in my humble opinion, the movie's sequels didn't do as well.
The acting is OK but far from good and the directing is the same as
most 'hollywoodian' movies from the last ten years (IE lacking personal
style. Seriously, what's the difference between a Wachowski bros. flick
and a Roland Emmerich one?).<br /><br />I've tried to watch it again on several occasions but usually I end up
fast forwarding to the main action scene and then turning the movie off
and then I get the feeling that that scene resumes the entire movie; a
lot of noise about nothing.
