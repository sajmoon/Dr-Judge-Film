1999_April 4 

Every good thing you hear about this movie is true.  The special effects are
amazing and Keanu doesn't talk much.  Any bad thing you hear is just someone
who just didn't get it.  The plot is simple: take one part Terminator, one
part Total Recall and two parts any movie like Dark City or 12 Monkeys or
that Star Trek episode where they fight at the O K Corral.  There are
weaknesses in dialogue but not enough to be bothersome, but the story is
good solid sci-fi.  What is the Matrix?  It's everywhere and
everything--simply, it's a computer program, but really it's not that
simple: watching the characters learn to understand that is two-thirds of
the movie AND THAT'S NOT A BAD THING.  We watch them learn and what we learn
about what's happened to their world in the mean time is interesting enough
to keep your mind wondering where all this is going.  Another reason to go
out and get a DVD player.....
