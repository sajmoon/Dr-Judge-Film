1999_April 9 

This movie will change Sci-Fi as we know it. Ironic that its released in the
same year as PHANTOM MENACE, by two relative unknowns, Los Bros. Wachowski.
But despite Episode One, I still think this is the movie that is sparking
the most word-of-mouth around the water cooler.  Never before seen,
inventive FX, strong themes, some say rehashed, but still made fresh and
different.  Exciting leads, perfect casting (Fishburne, as always, magnetic;
Moss was icy cool, strong;your villain defines your heroes, and Weaving was
superbly evil, but also defined himself and why Agents do what they
do;lastly, Reeves always handled the physical roles well, but he also
emoted, showed a little of himself in scenes, something we hadn't seen in a
while.  Good films and good directing brings out the best in you.  In the
words of Morpheus, &quot;You must experience the MATRIX for
yourself!&quot;.
