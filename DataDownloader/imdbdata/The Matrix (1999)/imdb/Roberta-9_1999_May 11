1999_May 11 

I went to see this movie with my two kids (13,10) and three other grown
ups,
we had a great time! The audience was mostly mature and we surely laugh a
lot. The following week my kids asked if we could see it again, so we
went,
seeing the movie for the second time made me realise the hidden
subtleties;
this time it was a very young audience at the theatre and they did not
laugh
much, for them it seems to be a more serious affair. To observe this was
very interesting.<br /><br />What I like about the movie apart from the cast and the effects is the
fact
that the heroes look like everyday people, there is no glamour in them,
they
are good looking people, but normal; their clothes aren't very good, the
buildings where they do their dealings don't look like mansions. I like
the
fact that the top guy is a black man, and that the tough guy is a girl,
and
that the hero is a bit dumb, and that the main
computer/driver/operator looks very Latino!<br /><br />In general I don't like violent movies, with lots of guns and stuff like
that; however, this movie blows the usage of those artifacts to such a
level
that cannot be viewed seriously.<br /><br />The story line reminds me of Teachings of Don Juan and all those books
(Carlos Castaneda), which made me like the movie even more.<br /><br />Where is everything? And if everything is there where is
there?
And apparently through quantum physics we are becoming more aware of
NOTHING
and the POWER of NOTHINGNESS, and the more we look into tiny matter the
more
this matter seems to not be there, maybe we are in a matrix after
all!
