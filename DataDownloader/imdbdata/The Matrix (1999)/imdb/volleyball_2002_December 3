I believe there are lots of similarities between The Matrix and The
Bible.  First of all characters from the Matrix are similar to people
from
the Bible.  Neo is like Jesus, Morpheus is like John the Baptist and
Cypher
is like Judas.
Both Neo and Jesus were born into the world and then born again, Neo
from
that red goop, and Jesus after he was baptised.  Also the both are
resurrected Jesus 3 days after he died on the cross and Neo, after he was
shot numerous times by agent Smith.  Cypher also betrays Neo like Judas
did
to Jesus all though they both new the truth.
In the Matrix the characters are in the world(the matrix) but not of
it,
just like Christians should be in the world but not of
it.
There are also many other biblical references in the matrix like the
verse Mark 3:11 inscribed on the plate which has the name of ship The
Nebuchadnezer.  Also in the beginning of the movie the man that comes to
Neo's door calls him his own personal &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;.
This is at least how I interpret it, and i'm sure I could find more
comparisons by watching the movie again.
