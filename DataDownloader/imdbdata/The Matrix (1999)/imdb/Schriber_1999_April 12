1999_April 12 

I've got to tell you, The Matrix suprised the hell out of me.  I expected
a
poorly executed, FX overloaded, nonsensical, wanna be blockbuster.<br /><br />I'm glad I was wrong!<br /><br />The Matrix was excellent.  The plot is classic (and well used) science
fiction.  If you've read Neuromancer, Entoverse, Realtime Interupt, or a
dozen others, you'll feel right at home.  There are the usual holes that
you
find in Sci-Fi movies (but not books), but overall they got a very
technical
concept across to Joe Idiot very well.<br /><br />First Fifth Element, now The Matrix.  I am amazed.  Maybe The Thirteenth
Floor will be good too!  And I thought all I had to look forward to this
year (at the box office) was Star Wars and South Park!!!<br /><br />
