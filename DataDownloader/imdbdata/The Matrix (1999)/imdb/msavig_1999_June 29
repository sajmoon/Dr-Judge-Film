When you first see The Matrix, you find yourself in front of whole new
concept of the world. You realize that maybe things are not the way they
appear to you, but they can be part of someone's else dream, for
example.<br /><br />This vision of reality, in addition to great action scenes and comic-like
costumes, scenography, dialogues and shots makes this movie one of the
greatest in its genre.
