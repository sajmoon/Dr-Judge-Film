I've seen the Matrix only once yet, but I can say for sure that it wasn't
the last time!  It's a fantastic movie that plays with your mind, and I
really like Keanu Reeves a lot in that role!  Why do so many people say
he's
not a good actor?  Well, however, for those who haven't seen the movie
yet,
get your ticket now, and enjoy the trip!!  Cause don't forget:
&quot;Unfortunately nobody can be told what the matrix is...you've got to see
it
for yourself...&quot;
