Like &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, the &quot;Matrix&quot; trilogy has at least two different
levels of story. Both are evident, but we, at first, only see the first
and less important, which is the Matrix itself and the
man-against-machine war. The second level, which is the central plot of
the whole thing, is so obvious that it becomes invisible.<br /><br />If you liked this movie more than the sequel, &quot;Matrix: Reloaded&quot;, then
you, like almost everyone else, didn&#39;t understand it. If you are
feeling bad about that, don&#39;t worry, it took me almost eight years to
finally understand it, too! Many people liked this first part, the rest
hated it, and both didn&#39;t understand it. Interestingly enough, the ones
that hated it were closer to understanding it than those that liked it.
People that didn&#39;t like the &quot;Matrix&quot; trilogy always talk about the
&quot;shallow story&quot; and the &quot;cheap philosophy&quot;. As much as they are right
about the cheap philosophy, they are complete and absolutely wrong
about the shallow story. The &quot;pseudo-philosophic junk&quot; is, actually,
junk, but a very important part of the story, and that is so clear in
this first part of the trilogy that no one actually realized it. It
happens because, taken alone, &quot;The Matrix&quot; is just a fantasy movie,
placed some time in the future.<br /><br />The key to realize the greatness of the &quot;Matrix&quot; trilogy is accepting
that it is a science fiction, not a fantasy movie. With that in mind,
you can find the real villain of the trilogy, then everything will make
sense, including the things that make no sense at all in a science
fiction movie, like Neo&#39;s skills, both inside and outside the Matrix.
The really interesting thing is that the villain openly shows its
evilness in &quot;Reloaded&quot;, it even explains its reason to do the things it
does, but we promptly forgive or forget it! And pay a lot of attention
to the dialogs at the very ending, in &quot;Matrix: Revolutions&quot;, don&#39;t be
deceived or misled by the background, because they present the final
results of the main struggle of the trilogy and you will realize who is
the winner.<br /><br />So, follow the white rabbit and find out who is the real villain in the
&quot;Matrix&quot; trilogy. After that, you will see that almost all speeches in
it have two completely different meanings, one that supports a weak
futuristic cloak-and-dagger flick, with lots of &quot;cool&quot;, but unimportant
Greek-and-whatever references, and another that leads to a much darker
reality, which will make you love the whole trilogy, or more properly,
the trilogy as a whole, not only this first installment.
