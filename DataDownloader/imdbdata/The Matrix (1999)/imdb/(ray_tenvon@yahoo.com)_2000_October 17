&quot;The Matrix&quot; is probably one of the most original movies ever made,
exciting, well-directed, and masterfully executed.<br /><br />The special effects are absolutely astounding and in ways that we've never
seen before. The direction is absolutely classic. The lobby scene is a great
pre-finale action scene, along with its follow-up that has the helicopter
and the huge explosion.<br /><br />No one will ever forget those exciting, fast-paced martial arts scenes.
They're too brilliant to forget.<br /><br />The characters are as memorable as the characters from the &quot;Star Wars&quot;
movies. Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity will still be remembered in twenty
years.<br /><br />The story is really what makes this movie so original. It's about a computer
hacker who discovers that the world is not as it seems (lame? keep reading).
The world is actually one large computer program or system, known only as
the Matrix, controlled by a higher power. The higher power is an
organization of machines who won the world off of the humans. Now, the real
world is in ruins, and the Matrix is the only place where people can live
(despite they're not really living and that they're simply computer
effects).<br /><br />The movie never stops or slows down. Towards the end, you can never really
pinpoint what is the climax because the movie keeps going, becoming more and
more interesting with each added scene. The ending may leave a door open for
a sequel (speaking of which, there are two coming), but it also makes it
seem like it's the end.<br /><br />&quot;The Matrix&quot; is a non-disappointing movie and a highly-satisfying experience
that no one in the world will ever forget.
