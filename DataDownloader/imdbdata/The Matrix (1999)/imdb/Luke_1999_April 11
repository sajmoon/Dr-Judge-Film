The Matrix is a sci-fi pulp fiction oozing cool styles. People with limited
imagination and tastes may prevent themselves from thoroughly enjoying the
film. Elements of the plot are derivative from a LOT of previous works (Dark
City, Blade Runner, Alice in Wonderland, religions (esp., Christian and
Buddhist) and etc.). However, they are combined and executed with finesse
and originality. Style-wise, it reminds me of Kubrick's' &quot;A Clock Work
Orange&quot; and Tarantino's &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. Keanu Reeves is a best fit for the
role, where explicit emotional acting is NOT required. Certain premises in
the plot may not be scientifically convincing, but they are irrelevant. The
matrix PROVOKES your imagination while overwhelms you with stunning visual
effects (CG and camera works). I expect it to be a huge box office success.
A solid 9 out of 10. Go see it on a big screen in a modern cinema. A
definite DVD collector's item.<br /><br />Open your mind.
