1999_April 24 

The plot moves quickly and keeps one's interest, and the special effects are
cool.  Those are the reasons why I voted as high as 5 on this very violent
movie.  I found it disconcerting that lead characters wear black
trenchcoats, sunglasses and combat boots while they indiscriminately kill
innocent people especially in light of the recent shootings at Littleton,
Colorado.  I suppose there may be people who think that human conscience is
not dulled by viewing of this kind of gratuitous murder. As a counselor I
cannot agree, and therefore I cannot recommend this movie.
