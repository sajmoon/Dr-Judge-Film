1999_August 4 

I don't think I've see a more complex (plot-wise) movie.  What CAN'T be
said
about this movie:<br /><br />Very good acting (esp. Keanu Reeves),
Exceptional plot,
Some of the best slow-motion, camera work, kung fu, action fighting,
special
effects, and gun play I've EVER seen!!!!<br /><br />My hat goes off to the Wachowski brothers.  One of the top 15 films made
in
the past decade.<br /><br />
