1999_April 16 

After seeing the trailers for this movie (especially the one where they play
Enigma to the slow motion action sequences), I was over-excited to see this
movie. Once it finally came out, I walked into the theater with high
expectations. The movie far exceeded my expectations. What we have here is a
masterpiece of filmmaking. It is visually, as well as intellectually,
stimulating. It's a special effects ride with a storyline, an actual plot.
The special effects don't get in the way of the story, they enhance it. The
action sequences were amazing. The slow-motion technique used throughout the
movie gave me chills. The Jackie Chan/Bruce Lee-like martial arts sequences
will leave you smiling and wanting more. I felt myself tensing and holding
my breath throughout the whole film. And the bullets!! They speak for
themselves! The cinematography was perfect. I loved every camera angle,
every shot, every extreme close up-fast out, in this movie. The acting of
everyone was very well done. Say what you will about Keanu Reeves' acting
ability, he did a good job with this movie. He had the perfect look for the
character he played. This movie is highly recommended to anyone who is even
the smallest fan of sci-fi, cyberpunk, film noir. It will blow your
mind.
