1999_May 15 

Okay, most movies with Keanu have to provide a limited acting
spectrum
for the guy, from the Bill and Ted light brain to the edge of
enlightenment
in Little Bhudda. This movie set him up just right, and used that presence
that always comes across as &quot;Uh, gee, could someone tell me what's going
on
around here?&quot;, and made it work in a big way!<br /><br />The Matrix made it's next perfect move by coming out BEFORE the Star
Wars prequel, which according to some friends who saw the sneak peak,
isn't
all that wonderful. No matter how good or bad SWs is, The Matrix would've
lost a lot of steam following it and The Mummy. As it is, now, I'm fully
willing to go to the theater and take advantage of the long lines piling
up
behind those two theaters in order to squeeze through and put my bucks
into
seeing The Matrix a second time, something I haven't done since '77 for
the
original Star Wars film.<br /><br />If you've not seen it, DO IT! The Matrix is the perfect
Sci-Fi/Dream-Reality movie. It's what almost any Movie or Sci-Fi fan would
put together if they had the money, the time, and knew an actor who's
strongest point will always be looking totally lost, even if he's read the
script and should know what's happening ;-)
