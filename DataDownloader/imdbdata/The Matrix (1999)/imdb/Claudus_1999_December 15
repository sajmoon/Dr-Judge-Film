The Matrix has to be one of the best movies ever created.  With it's
groundbreaking special effects, and wild plot it keeps the viewer riveted to
their seat for the entire film.  If you haven't seen it already, you don't
know what you're missing.  I personally own around 50 movies and this one
has to rank amongst the top 5 movies that I own.  DON'T MISS THIS
MOVIE!
