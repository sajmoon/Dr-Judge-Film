1999_June 18 

An intellectual twist on the cyberpunk theme, drawing inspiration from the
works of William Gibson, Philip K. Dick and even Terry Gilliam.
Outstanding
new special effects which may, according to some put The Phantom Menace in
the shade, and the plot sidesteps nicely on a number of occasions allowing
you to exercise the old grey matter a little.
Lawrence Fishburne (Apocalypse Now, Boys N' The Hood, Event Horizon,
Othello...) is as excellent and dramatic as ever. Keanu Reeves is, well
just
Keanu Reeves doing what he does best and that's looking perpetually
confused. Also as the film is Australian, look out for a smattering of
soap
stars.....<br /><br />Well worth two hours of your time.
