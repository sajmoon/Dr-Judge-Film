1999_May 5 

First off the plot was awesome and at the same time easy to follow.
Special
effects was alright, but that's okay since this was not an &quot;eye candy&quot;
movie.  This movie is worth the money, if you are into sci-fi you will
love
it... if you're not into sci-fi... then well then... go see something
else...  But above all follow the story more than you would a
cartoon.
