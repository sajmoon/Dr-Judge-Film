Finally, a Sci-Fi movie that out does the special effects with an
intriguing
plot.  Even with Keanu's limited depth as an actor he pulls off this role
nicely as a disenchanted hacker with two separate lives.  The rest of the
cast do a great job and and basically fill in all the gaps of the complex
human spirit.  Every character in this movie is well layered with a range
of
motivations, limitations, and talents.  The plot develops very well with
several twists and misdirections and while being fantastical it manages to
stay very close to the believable.  To me this movie would be equally
appealing to the Sci-Fi fanatic and the steadfast realist.  I hope everyone
enjoys this movie as much as I did!
