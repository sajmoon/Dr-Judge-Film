1999_June 21 

I hate to admit it, but I actually enjoyed this movie. I'll get to that
later, but first I'll say this: It's NOT a good movie. I've heard
comparisons to great works of art such as Blade Runner and 2001, but this
is
not a philosophical movie. It doesn't even get to where Dark City got
(which
wasn't such a great movie either). There are some bits where you can
detect
a philosophical question, but it's way too forced and unbelievable,
especially from these characters. There are a lot of plot holes and
ridiculous situations, and many characters are very lame (Morpheus?! give
me
a break!). The one nice actor and character was that of Agent Smith, the
major villain. But, like I said, I enjoyed the movie. Now, I consider
myself
a man with quality taste, in movies as well. Let's just say, this is not
my
type of movie. Why I enjoyed it? I really don't have a clue. I despise
action movies, which base themselves on special effects and ridiculous
plots. But this movie I liked. And it's not that my taste has changed,
because give me any other action movie and I'll hate it. I really liked
the
action sequences and special effects. The movie itself was directed quite
well, actually. I was excited by superficial and popular elements, and I'm
still torturing myself for that. But who knows? There might be something
else in this film. There must be, because I don't enjoy others that I
THINK
are like it. But maybe you should give it a chance and see it for
yourself.
If you find that special something, I'd like to hear it.
