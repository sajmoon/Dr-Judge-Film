&quot;The Matrix&quot; is quite possibly the most overrated film I have ever seen.
In
it's defense the film has certainly garnished a legion of loyal fans from
all over the world. And why shouldn't it? The film features
ground-breaking
special effects that are becoming more and more mainstream; the action
sequences (which are choreographed by Hong Kong cinema legend Yuen
Woo-ping)
never fail and are always entertaining, and the art direction and
cinematography hit their targets well.<br /><br />But what happened to the story? Everything else about this film works so
well that being subjected to a story that borrows from nearly every other
Sci-Fi film I have ever seen bores very quickly. Yes, I am fan of Quentin
Tarantino who does exactly the same with his scripts. The difference:
Tarantino's films (&quot;Resivour Dogs,&quot; &quot;Pulp Fiction,&quot; and &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;)
are
entertaining from beginning to end and surely contain more intrestingly
constructed dialogue than one boring Laurence Fishburne speech about &quot;the
real world&quot; after another.<br /><br />However, the film's most irritating character has to be Agent Smith played
by Hugo Weaving. After viewing &quot;Men in Black&quot; it's hard not to laugh at
Weaving's character nor feel the nails sliding down a chalkboard when he
speaks. &quot;Mr. Anderson...&quot;<br /><br />Though the single most irritating thing about &quot;The Matrix&quot; is how many
people love it and claim it to be the greatest of all Science Fiction
films.
Would have been intresting to see Yuen Woo-ping direct this film and
co-star
Jet Li. Neither of which are appearing in the sequels now as once
intended.<br /><br />**1/2 out of ****
