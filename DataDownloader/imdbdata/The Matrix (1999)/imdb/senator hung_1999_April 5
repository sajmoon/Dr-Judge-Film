1999_April 5 

I really enjoyed this film, not because it did anything outstanding, but
just because it presented a decent story with exhilarating special effects
and Keanu Reeves (!)
martial arts action.<br /><br />The film presents us with a scenario which forces us to ask what reality
consists of and how we know that what we see, feel and sense are true
representations of the world.<br /><br />The fuzzy line between solid reality and the human-centered perceptions of
dreamtime or virtual reality get twisted into a grim future scenario where
the slaves enjoy the bounties and the 'free' subsist on whatever they can
scavenge.<br /><br />The film glorifies the hackers, those who believe in freedom on principle,
believing that individuals have the power to change their realities and
good
old fashioned chop-socky  (albeit, with quite a few nods to the mortal
kombat ilk of arcade games)<br /><br />I was thoroughly entertained and plan on seeing it again real
soon!
