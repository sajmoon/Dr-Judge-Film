Keanu Reeves has a limited repertoire as an actor, but when he looks good,
he
REALLY looks good!  This is a slick science fiction action thriller.
Every
moment you think you know what is going on, you get another 130 degree
left
turn.  the supporting cast is excellent.  Only Keanu Reeves could have
pulled off looking that cool in his all black outfit without looking like
a
complete idiot.  The special effects, the interaction with the
controllers,
and the sub-play within the human crew are all excellent.  Truly worth the
money.  I can hardly wait for the DVD.
