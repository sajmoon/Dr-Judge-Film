BEST PICTURE NOMINEE would have been giving the Matrix full credit for its
great storyline. Keanu did a great job and no one else could have done as
good of a job as he had.  I work for a video store and most people love the
movie as much as I do.  The entire concept, everything about the movie was
great.  The effects, everything.  Bring on the sequels, I just hope they can
live up to the first one's huge standards.
