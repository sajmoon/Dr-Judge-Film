I really didn't expect much from this film and was not prepared to be as
blown away as I was.<br /><br />The minds which created this story must be fascinating! It's one I'd like
to
watch again and examine with friends to catch all that I'm sure I missed
the
first time.<br /><br />Amazing camera work and the special effects combined to create a visually
stunning experience which left this viewer on the edge of her
seat.
