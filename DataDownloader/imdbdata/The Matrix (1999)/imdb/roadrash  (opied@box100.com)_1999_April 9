1999_April 9 

Yes, I know it is derivative, and lord knows anyone who actually thought
that Mr. Reeves could act could use to up their medication dosages, but what
the hey? I liked it.  A lot.  To tell you the honest truth, it is the first
science fiction movie I have seen in a long time that was worth the price of
admission.  The best thing about it is it has some PLOT, (actually, a more
complicated than it appears at first) and some thought went into the way
things were organized.<br /><br />During the showing (about half way through) three teenaged guys in front of
us got up and walked out.  I guess that too many people these days are
afraid to put any thought into watching a movie and would rather just have
the world thrown into their laps.  If action is what you need, there is
plenty of crap out there that will satisfy you;  If you like a little
thinking man's action with the plot to go with it, see The Matrix. Be warned.
This isn't a &quot;Check your brain at the door&quot; kind of flick.<br /><br />
