1999_May 10 

I'll admit... I'm not a big Keanu Reeves fan, so I kept my expectations a
bit lower than usual when I went to see this movie. I was definitely
surprised! I think this was his best performance ever. Neo is a likable
character thrust into a world that he was neither aware of nor oriented
to,
and then expected to save. There is an innocence about the character that
is
touching when he discovers the Matrix and learns how to interact within
it.
As the movie progresses, you really hope that he is the
One.<br /><br />The rest of the cast was wonderful as well. I'm usually critical of the
strong female image many movies try to project. But this movie surprised
me
there as well. Trinity, played by Carrie-Anne Moss, is also an interesting
and compelling character. She initially appears to be Neo's
watcher/bodyguard, but somewhere the relationship becomes more personal...
and even more interesting.<br /><br />The visual effects were the best part of the film. That's mostly because I
can often clearly see the computer enhancements and can point them out.
These visual effects flowed smoothly and were not obvious. It really was
fantastic.<br /><br />Lastly, I've got to say I loved the Oracle. She was great.
