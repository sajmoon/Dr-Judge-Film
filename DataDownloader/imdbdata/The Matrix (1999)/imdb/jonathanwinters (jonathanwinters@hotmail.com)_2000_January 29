I think that The Matrix was one of the best films of 1999.  The concept was
excellent, but yet the actual execution of the plot could have been
improved
upon slightly.<br /><br />The special effects in the movie were spectacular and revolutionary.  I
enjoy special effects, and his the matrix had eye-candy comin' out of it's
output plug.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves' character could have had a better script, but only in a few
places was it a bit flaky.<br /><br />Spend a few dollars and buy the movie.  If you want to spend a little
extra,
the collector's addition has a making-of section at the end which describes
the special effects and concept of the movie.<br /><br />This movie makes me go &quot;woa!&quot;
