Well, being a sci-fi fan this was bound to please<br /><br />It did more, it spellbound to the extreme where you actually want to
question the reality.<br /><br />I first saw this in the cinema, and WOW was the only thing to say, it's
black and bleak look at mans self destruction, only to become a battery for
machines.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves plays what has to be his best role to date as Neo/Anderson,
the
naive choosen one.  Lead by a solid story and excellect direction the film
goes from jaw dropping effect to stark thought.<br /><br />It's good to see a film which was lauched UK side with minimal promotion
make such a huge impact, I had heard so many rumours of this script and
it's
effects it made the films a must go, now I am just counting the days until
Matrix 2, Then Matrix 3 completes the story.<br /><br />If you ask anyone who has seen the film it is going to be one of two
answers, you either like it or you hate it, there doesn't seem to be too
much inbetween, trust me, keep the open mind, watch it and enjoy
it.
