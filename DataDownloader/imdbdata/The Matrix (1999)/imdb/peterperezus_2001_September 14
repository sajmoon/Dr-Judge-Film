This is one best action films ever made.  It moves quickly and is full of
tension.  And there is a good internal logic to it.  Unfortunately there
have been a lot of copycats that have followed it.  Most o those other films
don't realize thatbthe special effects and the characters flying all over
the place made sense because of what was established through the plot and
premise.  &quot;Charlie's Angels&quot; works for kids, but does it make sense for them
to be flying and kciking like that?  No!
