1999_July 7 

At first, I thought &quot;Oh god, not another one.&quot;  We've had the disaster
movies (Armageddon, Titanic, ...), we've had the ..., and now we're having
the &quot;is it real or is it VR&quot;movies (EXistenZ, ...).
But not so with &quot;The Matrix&quot;.
OK, it's about virtual reality, but what a virtual reality!  The plot is
overwhelming, unbelievable and perfectly logical.  A real mind teaser.
The
special effects were simply fantastic.
In my opinion, it's one of the best movies of the year.  You will leave
there stunned, overwhelmed and begging for more.
If you haven't seen it, go and do so!!!
Deserves at least 10/10.
