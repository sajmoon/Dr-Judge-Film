While this movie seems to be highly rated on this site, there also seem to
be a lot of users slamming this movie. Obviously, the movie is not
perfectly
realistic. There are logistical problems with how the Matrix would work,
the
whole concept of Zion is ill-concieved, but I think what the Wachowski
brothers were essentially trying to do is transfer a comic book to the
screen. If you look at the book on the making of the Matrix, or of some of
the storyboards shown on the DVD, you'll understand what I mean. Not to
mention the planned anime prequels.<br /><br />Morpheus is a 2-dimensional wisened mentor of a super-hero, nothing more,
nothing less, and Fishburne plays him excellently. Neo was supposed to
just
be confused a lot, which Keanu can do pretty well. Joe Pantoliano was
great
as Cypher, and Hugo Weaving was excellent as usual as Agent Smith. All
relatively simple, yet well-written and well-played characters.<br /><br />Carrie-Ann Moss is a pretty bad actress, and she looks like a cadaver.
That's really the only flaw in the movie.<br /><br />The brothers Wachowski very successfully articulate their comic book
vision
on-screen, and it is a visually stunning film with great effects and well
thought out action scenes. The opening of the hotel lobby scene is one of
the coolest things I've ever seen.<br /><br />Stop criticizing this movie and take it for what it is, a slightly more
serious, less mindless, action-packed sci-fi movie. It's already being
imitated throughout Hollywood, but once that clears up in a few years,
people will see how original this is.<br /><br />If Star Wars deserves its spot on the Top 250, then the Matrix definitely
does.
