1999_September 9 

I think the Matrix is a very deep movie, with a lot of biblical undertones!
The concept of the made a little worried about the development of computers,
and the rate it is going in.
It made me think that life might not be what it seems to
be!
The actors in the movie did a hell of a job. I was amased of the acting
abilities of some of the people! (keanu reeves, laurence
fishburne)<br /><br />All in all, the movie is now my favorite, and I think it will stay like that
for a very long time!!<br /><br />Sincerly Ove Wettavik!!!!!!?...........
