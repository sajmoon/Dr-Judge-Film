1999_October 14 

the matrix is a film full of contradictions.. some of the most stunning
visuals and set design, an interesting premise- but a film delivered with
the usual excesses of hollywood crap.   It's exciting and quite original-
but Keanu is not a good actor-&quot;I know Kung Fu...&quot;(what??)<br /><br />My perception of the film is a very american and shallow attempt to hijack
intelligent/spiritual concepts in the name of making a stack of cash- kind
of like a thought provoking movie for the MTV generation (its deep dude!!
yeah man, cool!!)<br /><br />I didn't enjoy the movie because I kept on thinking how the directors had
targeted the movie at the lowest common denominator-- (as with 'Phantom
Menace'). If the films concept of 'reality not being reality' is an idea
you've never considered before- you really should try and get out
more.<br /><br />Negativity aside, I'd say that for kids, The Matrix ix  great-- if you want
to watch a cheesy Hollywood flick its great too--
its not a good Hollywood movie, because it attempts to be more than it is.
For  a good Hollywood movie check 'Men in Black'-by no means perfect, but
more fun and less pretentious.<br /><br />I look forward to all replies constructive and/or abusive.. just remember
this- I'm right.
