Ive read most of the comment made by the members of IMDb, and im suprised
at
the amount of people who said this was a piece of junk and not worth the
pricetag. Anyone who believes this must have had absolutely no idea of
what
was going on.<br /><br />Whether it was an original screenplay or not, the way the story was told,
along with the amazing special effects makes this a film to remember. I
admit, Keanu Reeves could use a bit more diversity in his acting but the
other characters like Trinity, Cypher, Tank and the agents were all played
very well by their respective actors.<br /><br />I watched this movie 2 or 3 times before i fully understood what the
'matrix' was and what the movie was all about, but the fact that you can
watch this movie time after time proves that in no way is this dull or
boring.<br /><br />Anyone who says this is a poor movie, i suggest you watch it a few more
times and try and understand yourselves whats going on.
