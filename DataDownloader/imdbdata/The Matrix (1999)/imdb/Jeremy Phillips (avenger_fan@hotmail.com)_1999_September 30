1999_September 30 

Having already gone down a storm in the United States, this sci-fi
thriller
finally arrives on British shores. Keanu Reeves plays Thomas Anderson, by
day an ordinary program writer, but by night a computer hacker with the
alias of &quot;Neo&quot;. He comes into contact with legendary female hacker
Trinity,
who tells him that the search is almost over. But the search for what? Why
is Neo being chased by less-than friendly Men In Black? And just what is
The
Matrix?<br /><br />Although criticism might seems irrelevant in the face of such a box office
steamroller, there is more to be had here than simple special effects. The
script evokes memories of Ridley Scott's classic Blade Runner, but the
question here is not &quot;What is human?&quot;, but &quot;What is real?&quot;. The ideas that
the screenplay contains, such the attractiveness of the &quot;mink-lined
prison&quot;
that is The Matrix, enhance a film already attention-grabbing through it's
visuals.<br /><br />And what visuals they are. Innovations in technology allow us to fly
around
kung-fu fights while time appears to stop, thanks to the creation of
bullet-time photography. The direction is also superb, alternating between
the depths of a future earth and an anonymous city of the present (in
reality, Sydney Australia). The otherworldly feel of the movie is
perfectly
in tune with the twisted nature of the worlds on display.<br /><br />Reeves is ideal casting as a man trying to comprehend his existence, and
in
fact the whole cast is seamlessly chosen. Particular praise must to Hugo
Weaving as the sinister Agent Smith. Rarely has a villain been so magnetic
on screen. This, combined with the film's best lines delivered in an
American-Australian hybrid accent, results in easily the best performance
in
any film I have seen this year.<br /><br />There is literally something for everyone in this film: intelligent
scripting, outstanding images and note-perfect acting. So what if the
ending
is at best opaque. What we have here is an instant classic, never setting
a
foot wrong, and giving us the most unique science fiction film since Blade
Runner.<br /><br />P.S. This review earned me a nomination of Young Film Critic Of The Year.

just thought I'd tell you
