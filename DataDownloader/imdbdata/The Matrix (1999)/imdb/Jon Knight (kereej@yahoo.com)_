<br /><br />Who is to say what is real or not? We are defined by our view of reality,
no matter how twisted or demented it is in comparison to 'normal' people.
*evil eye* Yes, I see you all, looking in the mirror, trying to decipher
whether or not your view is the reality we all share.<br /><br />The Matrix not only supplies the world with a whole new level of special
effects mixed with style and substance, it also brings a whole new meaning
to the word 'paranoria'. This is one of those great epics that becomes a
milestone in our present day world, a mark for which just about everybody
can appreciate. Not since the original Starwars trilogy has a science
fiction film reached across almost the entire population and gripped it
with
awesome special effects, great sound, and a overall feel of ground breaking
movie making magic. It also serves up a good dose of paranoid delusions we
all need in our lives every now and then.<br /><br />With that, I leave you with the fact that I've seen more different types of
people liking this one film than most other films to date. Move over George
Lucas, you may have just met your match... :)
