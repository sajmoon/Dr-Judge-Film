1999_April 11 

I just have to comment on my favorite movie ever, in my opinion anyways. All
the good comments about the films special effects and story have already
been spoken for, so I'll just agree with that and have no need to add
further on that. I also really enjoyed the directing of the movie by those
Wachowski brothers. The way the soundtrack and film
goes together, it's done so well, that sometimes you don't notice the sound,
but its keeping you with the scene so well. I don't know if what I said
makes sense, I just woke up and I'm not very alive right now. But The Matrix
kicks A$$ in my book, i've seen it 6 times now in the past week, i'll make 8
today. And i don't ever see movies in this frequency.<br /><br />
