1999_April 25 

I usually don't like science fiction based movies, but I absolutely loved
The Matrix.  I was stunned by the special effects and the plot was
incredibly interesting and had my attention the whole way through.  This
movie is the first film, in a very long time, that did not make me glance at
my watch to figure how much time I had left before I could leave.  Could a
woman actually like kung fu and guns?  Mix in Keanu Reeves and I have to say
yes, yes they can.  I am going to go back and watch this film to get the
finer points of the film that I may have not caught the first time around.
I can't say it's The Usual Suspects, but it's still one helluva a movie.  GO
SEE IT!
