I am going to review the &quot;Matrix&quot; from a metaphysical angle.  The movie
starts with Trinity in room 303. Certain numbers had special meanings to the
ancients, and this movie makes reference to those numbers.  In the beginning
of the movie, Thomas/Neo Anderson sees the world through the philosophy of
English philosopher Locke who states that all
matter, so far as we know it, is a mental condition, and the only reality
that we know directly is the mind.  Thus, human kind lives in bondage to the
AI (Artificial Intelligence) machines.  As Neo is shown the real world
through guidance of Morpheus and Trinity, Neo becomes the &quot;one&quot; who will
save humanity.  <br /><br />Neo lives in apartment 101. The number 101 translates to 2 (1+0+1 = 2
mystical math).  The number 2 symbolizes dualism, conflict to the ancients. 
Thus, Neo must evolve to a higher level to solve this struggle.  When Neo
becomes the &quot;one,&quot; he is in room 303.  The number 303 translates to number 6
[(3+0+3) = 6].  The number 6 comprises the union of the two triangles (of
fire and water) and hence signifies the human soul.  <br /><br />Matrix is a mixture of Eastern and Western philosophies and theologies. 
Morpheus the leader states that he has been looking for the reincarnation of
the founder of Zion.  This is a Buddhist concept analogous to the Tibetan
monks who search for the reincarnated Dalai Lama.  The Christian aspect is
that
Neo can be compared to the Messiah who will give up his life and be
resurrected to save mankind.   <br /><br />Morpheus is a reference to Greek mythology in which Morpheus is the god of
dreams.  Morpheus will wake Neo from Matrix virtual dream world.  <br /><br />Trinity is a reference to number 3.  The number 3 symbolizes
spiritual synthesis, and represents the solution of the conflict posed by
dualism.  To the Christians it means the Father, Holy Ghost, and Son. 
Taoism is equated with the Yin (passive force, feminine), Yang (active
force, masculine), 
and Yin-Yang is bounded by circle of stability combine to form a ternary
system, the Tao.  <br /><br />Thus, Morpheus, Trinity, and Neo together overcome the Matrix as the they
ascend to a higher level of understanding, and Neo becomes the &quot;one&quot; through
opening of his mind.  Neo's mind becomes Kantan - perception of reality is
through active participation of the mind.  <br /><br />Neo is instructed by Trinity to follow the White Rabbit.  This is a
reference to Jefferson Airplanes' song &quot;White Rabbit&quot; (Surrealistic Pillow,
1967) in which singer Grace Slick refers to the different pills Alice can
choose to make her 10 feet tall, small, or nothing at all.  By following the
white rabbit, Neo does have to make a choice between the Red or Blue pill
offered by Morpheus.  The Red Pill has many meanings: Christ's blood,
suffering, excitement, danger.  The Blue Pill
refers to the Establishment, IBM Blue conservatism, coldness, safety. Neo
has free will to make a choice that will lead him to different paths.  Neo
does not believe in fate.  The choice one makes in different points in life
leads to different life situations which in turn changes person's point of
view.  <br /><br />The fourth main character is Cypher (short for Lucifer) who betrays the
renegade freedom fighters for falsehood life in the Matrix.  The number 4
means death in the East.  Thus, Cypher causes death and dies himself. <br /><br />The Oracle foreshadows the coming of the future as the Oracle of Delphi in
Greek mythology foretold the future to the Greeks.  Even Morpheus
foreshadows the future by stating that when Neo is ready he won't have to
dodge bullets.  <br /><br />When Neo is freed from the Matrix, Neo is born again into the real world by
falling down through a watery birth canal tube.  Neo falls into a pond
symbolizing baptism. Morpheus' octagonal hovercraft lifts Neo into its
safety.  The number 8 (octagonal shape) symbolizes regeneration.  In the
Middle Ages, the number 8 was used as emblem of the waters of baptism. Thus,
Neo is re-born, and begins to see the real world without the Matrix. <br /><br />The hovercraft is named Nebuchadnezzar. Nebuchadnezzar in the Bible was a
Babylonian king who wakes up from a dream knowing the answer but doesn't
know the question.  In the Bible, prophet Daniel interprets Nebuchadnezzar's
dreams.  In the movie, Morpheus and Trinity guide Neo to the question &quot;What
is Matrix?&quot;.  <br /><br />The 45 caliber gun used to kill Neo is commonly referred to 1911.  1911
(1+9+1+1) equals 12, and 12 (1+2) equals 3.  The number 12 symbolizes
wholeness in the West - apostles of Jesus Christ, months of year, signs of
Zodiac (symbol of the cycle of existence).  Thus, Neo is resurrected, and
destroys Agent Smith, the leader of the Centium Programs (sentinels), by
entering Agent Smith's body - a hacker breaking into a computer system and
destroying the kernel of the system.  <br /><br />Neo becomes the Messiah (the &quot;one&quot;) and arrives at Nirvana (one with the
infinite universe), and now he can free mankind from bondage. <br /><br />The main theme of this movie is that once you believe in yourself, then you
can overcome any obstacles and achieve your goals.  <br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone - see it for your mind or just for
the stunning visual effects.  <br /><br />
