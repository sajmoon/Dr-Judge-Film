At its deepest level, The Matrix ponders the question of human alienation, a
problem first contemplated by Karl Marx. Although Marx's answer was
insufficient, based as it was on an unrealistically sanguine view of human
nature, the problem remains just the same:  we are all slaves to a machine
like system that sucks the very life out of us.  <br /><br />Ezra Pond described our current life in Postindustrial society so well in a
few lines of verse:  `This thing, that hath a code and not a core, has set
acquaintance where might be affection, and nothing now disturbeth its
reflections.'  A code and not a core:  I once had a boss, as I'm sure we all
have, who had a code and not a core, a puny man who treated himself, and
others, as little machines &#150; nothing more than isolated parts of the larger
machine.  As if a cruel joke by the almighty, this man's surname happened to
be `Lord,' which compelled him to refer to himself in the third person as
`The Lord.'  He had a code but not a core.  In The Matrix, the machine code
of cybernetic self-regulated social development is not only non-human, it is
anti-human;  and people who have lost their souls to conform, who have codes
instead of cores, are the norm and not the exception.  It's as prophetic as
old Elijah himself.    <br /><br />What I love about this film is the solution it presents.  The answer is not
found in a radical change of human nature, which isn't possible, or in
technology, which would be like adding fuel to the fire.  Instead, borrowing
from Plato's cave metaphor, which says, basically, that the world of matter
we perceive with our five senses is an illusion, a mere reflection of a
deeper, more permanent, reality, The Matrix also takes Augustine's belief
that the road to God runs within (the whole `Zion' motif), and places the
divine act of creation the very hands of humans.  Rilke thought that we are
dreams in the mind of God.  According to The Matrix, however, God is a dream
in the minds of men.  The power of human imagination makes it so.  In this
scenario, Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams, is the voice in the wilderness
who cries `prepare the way of the Lord.'  <br /><br />The Matrix is an astonishing piece of modern myth making.  This is what
great film is all about.  If you haven't seen it in a while, it may be time
for another look.
