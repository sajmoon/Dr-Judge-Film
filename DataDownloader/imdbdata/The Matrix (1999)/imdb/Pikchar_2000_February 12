The Matrix is a very good movie mainly because of the powerful storyline and
the special effects. The direction is 'simple' and straight-forward; and the
Director relies on the atmosphere, sets and dialogue as well as the special
effects to tell the story; rather than the Camera angles and
technique.
The acting is very good from all three stars. Definitely a movie worth
watching many times!
