1999_April 5 

I saw the Matrix and I was completely blown away from it. The special
effects were very impressive and well performed. They did not take over the
story but worked with it beautifully. It had potential of becoming a bit
pretentious but managed to stay away from it.<br /><br />The actors really were amazing and the mix between special effects, martial
arts and philosophy worked together fabuously. I will go and see it again and
I recommend others to do the same.
