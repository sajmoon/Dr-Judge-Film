1999_May 26 

After it seemed like everyone else around me had seen The Matrix, seen it
again, loved it and ranted endlessly about it, I finally went and saw it!
And let's just say this: it is not a GOOD movie, but it is extremely
entertaining and worth seeing in the theaters (it's not worth seeing at
home, in my opinion).  Obviously, The Matrix is beautiful and stunning
(kung
fu sequence, anyone?) but it is also quite confusing in spots and boring
in
others (little squid-like things keep attacking their ship in what turns
out
to be an almost totally unnecessary subplot).  The acting is lacking but
sufficient, and the writing was, in my view, disappointing.  There were a
number of scenes that would have been PERFECT had the characters (or
writers, as the case may be) had the sense to say the right thing.  There
were a number of scenes I DID like :the scene comparing humans to a
disease,
the first meeting between Neo and Morpheus,  the building jump (the
requisite Keanu Reeves &quot;whoa&quot; moment) and the ending scenes.  The visual
effects are the real star of the show, and they're worth paying the
theater
price to see.  So, basically, it's never going to be a classic (well,
maybe
at cult status) but The Matrix is a very entertaining, beautiful
ride.
