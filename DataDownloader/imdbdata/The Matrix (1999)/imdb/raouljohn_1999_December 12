1999_December 12 
Sci-Fi has been an on-going stimulation in my life.<br /><br />Forgive me, but I think &quot;Dr.Who&quot;, for example, is super-stimulating,
let alone fore-casting . . .<br /><br />David Lindsay's (1897-1945) &quot;A Voyage To Arcturus&quot;, which so influenced
C.S.LEWIS, I found by accident in a book sale, and 'got me going' in my
appreciation of so many wonderfully stimulating writers of the genre.<br /><br />This is not to overlook an astonishing array of writers and film
makers, past and present. I feel fortunate indeed to have lived in an
age of such amazingly intelligent imagination, encompassing both the
macrocosm and the microcosm, as well as astonishing technical and
applied skills - both east &amp; west.<br /><br />The MATRIX, as I have experienced it, successfully embraces a wide
range of heart-felt interests and concerns. I found myself very much at
ease after the experience of seeing it on the big screen. Well done,to
say the very least.<br /><br />May I share one reaction?<br /><br />Do you remember in &quot;AMADEUS&quot;, when Mozart is graciously told by the the
Prince Arch-Duke of Austria, in response to one of his Operas, that
there were, simply, &quot;Too many notes&quot;?<br /><br />Well, forgive me again, but my first reaction to the Trailers of
&quot;MATRIX&quot; was, &quot;TOO MANY BULLETS!&quot;<br /><br />Notwithstanding this quibble, and allowing the films appeal to a wide
audience, &quot;MATRIX&quot; has set an high standard for the future. I find it
full of good things! It has opened to me a door to the the future! It
has done this, in my in-expert opinion, remarkably well . . ..<br /><br />More, please!<br /><br />May I express my gratitude for this opportunity to express my reaction
to 'MATRIX'<br /><br />Every best wish for the festive season,<br /><br />JOHN CAMPBELL.
