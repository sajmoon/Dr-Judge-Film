Some flicks that are slightly above mediocre get too much overenthusiastic
response.  Then I think that it's either me or the world around me that's
crazy.  `The Matrix' is good, VISUAL entertainment.  Let's face it: the
movie survives the second viewing because we enjoy watching agent Smith beat
up anyone who gets in his way.  He does it coldly, methodically, and
effectively.  Besides, I think he is the only well-developed, well-acted
character that sticks in memory. The best and the only intelligent scene in
this movie is when he utters `I-HATE-THIS-PLACE' to Morpheus.<br /><br />As far as the premise goes, I was slightly intrigued by it initially, but
not anymore after I read the reviews that treated it like a new religion. 
People, the ideas expressed in this movie do not make it a prophecy.  It is
something added to the visual effects to give it a touch of intellectualism.
 It was not meant to be very deep.  The writers must've never expected such
a wave of acceptance.  They are probably thinking about the over-obsessed:
`what a bunch of dupes&#133; oh well, we won't mind if it helps generate the
revenue'. <br /><br />And what a downer was the blue pill/red pill scene!  This must've seemed
stupid and denigrating to most adult viewers.  The movie's seriousness is
undermined and it's just fights and special effects from that point on. 
Even the last fight between Neo and agent Smith is trivialized by Reeves'
amateurish imitation of Bruce Lee's holding the sidekick. <br /><br />I have to admit though that the visual effects are original and innovative.
Thus my rating is a generous 6/10 for that and that alone. <br /><br />
