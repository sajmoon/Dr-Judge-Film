I have never fallen asleep at the cinema, but The Matrix is the closest
I've
ever come to doing so.  Quite frankly, the first hour of this film is the
most boring hour of film ever.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves cannot act, neither can Laurence Fishburne, Carrie Ann Moss
doesn't do much better.  The whole thing is too dark, and let's be honest:
If you've seen the trailer, you don't need to see the film, as it shows
you
all the special effects there anyway.<br /><br />I've been more disappointed by other films, but I fail to see how this
uninspiring and badly acted mess is hailed so much by fans.  Any old fool
can string together a series of special effects, the trick is to link them
with a good story and enjoyable characters.  The Matrix does neither.<br /><br />I'll admit it picks up a bit in the second half, but I was so completely
and
utterly appalled by the first hour, no amount of bullet time, however
impressive, can save this film.<br /><br />My Rating: 4/10
