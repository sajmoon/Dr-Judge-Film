1999_April 26 

I might add that the sound for this film is first rate.  I was complaining
to a friend just a few days prior to seeing The Matrix that a lot of films
don't know what to do with the Surround channels.  There is an old-school
mentality that says we mustn't be bombarded with audio data the whole time.
But isn't total immersion the point?<br /><br />In addition to aurally immersing us for nearly the entire movie, Dane Davis
and crew made some awesome fight noises and other special sounds, without
which the visual effects wouldn't have seemed quite so impressive.  My
favorite in particular is when Neo touches the mirror and screams; his
scream is broken down, sounding as if it had been turned into a bitstream
like those streaming green characters we see throughout the movie (a nod to
&quot;Tron,&quot; perhaps, where Flynn gets reduced to his component
&quot;bits.&quot;)<br /><br />See it in a THX-certified theater if you can...
