1999_April 9 

This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long while. The cast is
great, Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss both give a superb performance,
and
Hugo Weaving is very menacing as Agent Smith. The story/plot was a tiny
bit
hard to follow at times, but not impossible to understand. Excellent and
phenomenal special effects... simply, a MUST see.<br /><br />
