1999_April 26 

I'm sitting at my sofa, eating chips and watching TV. A preview for a new
movie, starring Keanu Reeves and Carrie Ann Moss, comes on so I hover around
the TV for an extra two seconds. The trailer looks great...the title is &quot;The
Matrix&quot;. April 2nd rolls around and I wander off to Funscape, local movie
theater, to see this acclaimed movie. BOY WAS IT WORTH IT! An all too
realistic plot, combined with digitally enhanced special effects and IN YOUR
FACE fighting sequences ranks &quot;The Matrix&quot; at the top of best movies seen in
1999. I guarantee that you'll see &quot;The Matrix&quot; a first time, a second time,
and if you're me...a fifth time. Looking for something to do? Well then get
off your bupkiss and go see &quot;The Matrix&quot;! (In theaters
now)
