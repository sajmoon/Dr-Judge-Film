1999_October 14 

This movie is a heavy mix of Japanese Animation (Anime), Hong Kong Cinema, &amp;
American comic book action all rolled up into one. This movie keeps you on
the edge of your seat till the end, and I mean it! Let's just hope that you
don't end up falling over... I would rate this hart pounding, not stop
action movie a 10 out of 10!!
