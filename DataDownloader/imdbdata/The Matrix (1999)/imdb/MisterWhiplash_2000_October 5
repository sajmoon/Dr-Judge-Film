Andy and Larry Wachowski's The Matrix is an unbelieveable achievement.
Not
only in  the visual sense,  but in storytelling, the way society is, and
much more.  And, Keanu Reeves is almost good here.<br /><br />Reeves playes 2 people in one- Thomas A. Anderson, a regular Joe who is
just
working it today's society.  The other is Neo, a comuter hacker who has
broken every single known computer hacking law.  But, he soon meets
Morpheus, played with great mysticism and wiseness by Laurence Fishburne,
who brings Neo down the rabbit hole to tell him the truth about the world;
we are living in a world called the Matrix, which uses out brain energy to
trun us into batteries.  Unbelieveable to be sure, but it is incredibly
original story wise, as it sprawls into something every average movie goer
can appreciate- hard boiled, visually and bloody packed action, gore and
violence.<br /><br />The best part though is that this film breaks many boundaries in
technology
and (with it's 4 Oscars for editing, sound, sound editing and visual
effects) and deserves every bit of credit it gets.  True, some might find
the plot confusing and boring and true it isn't for all tastes.  But if
you
can like the story and the action, you've got the key to a fantastic
picture, otherwise it is another action flick (great action
never-the-less).
Kudos to everyone who worked on the film, making one of the best films of
the year, decade and of sci-fi film history.  A++
