1999_April 7 

Kudos to Warner Brothers for breaking their bad-movie slump.  THE MATRIX is
their best release in a long time, and it will make a kickass DVD!  I wasn't
expecting much from a cheesy sci-fi movie starring Keanu Reeves and a bunch
of other unknown actors, but whoa, I was blown away by
this!<br /><br />There are a few problems with the movie, granted, but these problems are far
outweighed by the incredible ingenuity of the story line and the best fight
scenes I have ever seen!  The &quot;agents&quot; were especially cool.  The worst
thing about this movie was the &quot;talking bad-guy&quot; syndrome.  The bad guys
talk too much when they are winning.  But it doesn't detract too much from
the movie, since the agent's speech is actually somewhat interesting.  Also,
the &quot;humans as energy&quot; scheme made no sense.  But there was nothing that
made the plot fall apart.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves is also... gasp;... GOOD in this movie.  I still can't
believe that is really him and Fishburne fighting.  Those scenes are so well
done it defies belief.  I thought the first half of the movie was the best
though, when you don't really know what is going on.  And the sci-fi jargon
actually makes sense, so it is not a bore to listen to.  Well, if you
haven't seen this movie yet, do it!  I hope TPM can top
Matrix!
