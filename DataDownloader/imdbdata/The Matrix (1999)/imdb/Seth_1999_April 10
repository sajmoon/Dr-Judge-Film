1999_April 10 

Since many people have not taken an in depth course in philosophy I
understand why so many people believe this movie's ideas were taken from
other movies. In actuality this movie's philosophical aspects were rooted in
the skeptical ideas created by John Locke and Rene Descartes 300 years ago.
The questions of reality and what is true have been around hundreds of
years due to these intelligent minds.  I am glad that there are writers out
there today that do not underestimate the intelligence of their audience. I
am happy that I got a chance to see this fast paced action film that broke
the mold of stereotypical action pictures through its intellectual
prowess!
