1999_April 22 

I really liked the storyline. Unfortunately, they could have done a lot more
with it.  I felt like I was looking at a mixture of Jackie Chan and Chow
Yung Fat (Replacement Killers) with a bit of True Lies and Sleeping Beauty
added for good measure.  I don't mind violent movies, but this one was
pushing violence for violence sake.  Special effects were technically good,
but totally un-original (Look at the Replacement Killers for the bullets
bouncing off the floor and True Lies for firing at a building floor from an
airplane (Harrier jet for True Lies, helicopter for the Matrix...same
difference (I preferred the Harrier).  This movie should have a rating
between 6.1 and 6.5
