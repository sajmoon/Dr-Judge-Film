1999_April 17 

I'm not into techno gen-X movies, but more of the classical art house type
movies.  But my friends all kept recommending to see this movie and I'm
glad
I listened.<br /><br />Take away all the killer special effects and fancy martial art scenes and
what you get is a movie that still has a well written plot!  I was on the
edge of my seat the entire time.<br /><br />Go see this movie, it's definitely worth all the hype (oh and an added
plus,
I had the Star Wars preview too!)
