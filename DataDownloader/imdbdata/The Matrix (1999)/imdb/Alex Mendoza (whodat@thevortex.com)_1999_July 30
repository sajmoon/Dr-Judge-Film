This movie rocks.  Never have I've been so entrance by a movie since The
Crow.  I've seen this movie countless times and I just don't get tired of
it.  Carie Anne Moss was great for this role. She started the movie on such
a fast pace I was amazed.  The audiance also agreed with there ooos and
awes.  The story line was also great.  Those who think it was weak and had
no point are those who view life in certain boundarys.  They limit their
imagination and don't realize how complex the story truly is.  The story
kept me interested and the special effects blow me away.  I recommend it to
anyone and everyone.  Although, those who think within the borders must step
in the theaters and have an open mind.  It's one hell of a movie to
watch.
