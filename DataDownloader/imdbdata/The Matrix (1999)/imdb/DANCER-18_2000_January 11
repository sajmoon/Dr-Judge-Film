I must say that I really really enjoyed watching this movie.It was that
best
that I have seen in a long time. Keanu Reeves was absolutely perfect in
this
film. He really captured the part of NEO. Then Laurence Fishburne was
excellent also. I really liked the way Morpheus was so protective of NEO.
Laurence is a one of a kind actor. I also enjoyed the performance by
Carrie-Anne Moss who is sort of a newcomer to some of us. I also noticed
Marcus Chong who we have seen previously in the movie (PANTHER). All these
actors gave great performances and I cannot wait until the sequel comes
out.
I suggest that everyone in the entire world, LOL LOL watches this film. It
is on my top 10 list of movies. Thanks for reading and have a great
day!!!
