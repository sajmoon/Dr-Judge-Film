The Matrix:  8 out of 10<br /><br />&quot;The Matrix&quot; raises the special effects bar yet another notch, with
stunning high-speed camerawork, Gap-commercial rotation-freeze frame, blur
motion effects, and loads of computer-generated effects that amazed me.  I
have not seen such a redefinition of the &quot;possible&quot; using computer effects
since I first saw &quot;Terminator 2&quot; and &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;.  Because of that
alone, this movie will make a lot of money.<br /><br />The movie most closely follows in the dark, cyberpunk tradition of &quot;Blade
Runner&quot;, but the plot is essentially the Christ story retold with guns,
leather, and sci-fi monsters.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves plays Neo (the Christ figure), who is brought into the true
&quot;Real World&quot; by Lawrence Fishburne, who plays Morpheus, the leader of a band
of rebels from the human city of Zion, fighting the forces of the Matrix, a
computer program that has run rampant and taken over the real world.  &gt; 
I predict this movie will be one of top at the box office in 1999 -- even
considering &quot;Star Wars, Episode I&quot; will soon follow and suck up the repeat
viewer market.<br /><br />The film combines karate, anime, armed-to-the-teeth, dressed-in-black
cyberpunk with a thought-provoking storyline about what is &quot;reality&quot; and
what is &quot;computer generated dreamworld&quot;.  It reminded me also of &quot;The
Lawnmower Man&quot;, with the Agents as guardians of the the heart of the
computers, and Keanu as the hacker who breaks their security.<br /><br />The story does have holes here and there, especially in explanations about
the machines harvesting humanity, and why a kiss of love can overcome death,
but the action is so rapid-fire and stunningly rendered, it does not ruin
the film.<br /><br />The actors all do well, considering the real top billing goes to the
special effects.  I thought Fishburne, Moss, and Agent Smith were most
compelling, with Keanu playing well but with no surprises.<br /><br />The movie IS &quot;eye candy&quot;, but that is not a bad thing.  It will be
wonderful to compare the &quot;The Matrix&quot; to &quot;Star Wars, Episode
I&quot;.<br /><br />Overall:  Above-average.  Redefines the effects bar.
Recommended.
