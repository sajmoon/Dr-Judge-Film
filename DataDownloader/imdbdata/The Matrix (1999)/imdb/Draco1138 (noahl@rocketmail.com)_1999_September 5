1999_September 5 
<br /><br />   A kick-ass movie. The very notion of our world, thoughts, reality, and
human spirit is explored. The movie leaves you feeling the back of your neck
for objects, questioning your every move, and hopeful that there are rebels
out there. 
   Agent Smith is one scary guy! The scenes on the hover craft as it is
being chased by squid is also great. 
   The movie's climax ranks as some of the best effects/plot of the movie.
The ending opens a great door for a sequel which I hope they do. There is
not a dull moment in this film. Everyone should see this
flick<br /><br />
