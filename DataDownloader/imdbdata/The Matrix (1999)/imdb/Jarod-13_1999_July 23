1999_July 23 

Before I went to this movie I saw the making of the Matrix and I immediately
thought: &quot;I have to see this movie!!!!!!&quot;. Since &quot;Terminator 2; Judgement
Day&quot; I haven't seen so impressive special effects, especially the &quot;dodge the
bullets scene&quot;. The story was great, with much references to the bible,
&quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and Greek mythology.<br /><br />Before I went to the movie I still had my doubts about the actors and the
theme of the film. Keanu Reeves' acting in &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; was absolutely
horrible, but than again, the script of that movie to. But he recovered when
he played an excellent role in &quot;Devil's Advocate&quot;. Laurence Fishburne's
&quot;Event Horizon&quot; wasn't also, just like &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;, a great movie. It
started well (except for the music in the beginning) but crashlanded in the
end. Laurence Fishburne is
(I think) still a bit underestimated by a lot of people as an actor. He was
great in this movie. The other keyplayers of the movie were also memorable.
As for the theme of the movie, I had my doubts. I had already seen a lot of
cyberpunk or virtual reality movies that weren't worth a second or even a
first watch. But this movie was awesome!!!!!!<br /><br />Next to this movie, I'm still waiting for that other SF (more fantasy) movie
Star Wars: Episode I; The Phantom Menace which will be released in September
(almost five months after the US-release, it's a disgrace) . I'm a big Star
Wars fan, but I think that &quot;The Matrix&quot; is, or will be, the movie of 1999. I
give it a 10!!!!!!
