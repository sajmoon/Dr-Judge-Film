<br /><br />What is The Matrix?<br /><br />You cannot be told - The Matrix is something you have to experience for
yourself.<br /><br />What is reality?  Is it something you can Taste? Feel? Smell?  What if
these senses can be manipulated, and it can be proven that those things you
experience as real are simply constructs - computer programs which stimulate
you just as you would be stimulated by the actual.   What
then?<br /><br />The time then comes to have a different measuring stick for reality.   If
you can be manipulated to believe something is true which is not true, what
other defense is there but to exercise free will - to be able to bend what
happens and how things work to your view of how things should
be.<br /><br />In order to do that, you must understand how things work.  And you must
believe in who you are.<br /><br />These are just some of the themes of this film - an important science
fiction movie masquerading as a John Woo, Hong Kong action-adventure film,
plugged into a video game.  What may be lost the first time you see this is
how The Matrix makes fun of these genres - the main character, a computer
hacker named Neo, goes through the classic kung fu movie arc - from student,
to teacher to master, but then he transcends the game entirely, by finally
holding off his foe with one hand, as he goes to the next level of the game.
This subversive humor plays throughout the movie, as it sneaks up on you
with Big Questions, which resonate more and more in these days of moral
relativity...   for example, currently in the Real World ethnic Albanians
are fleeing Kosovo.  Why?  The U.S. says they're fleeing Serbian ethnic
cleansing.  The Serbs say they're fleeing NATO bombing.  Who's right?  Ask
the people fleeing!<br /><br />In order to be able to find the answers, you have to know the right
questions, and The System which is running when those questions are being
asked.<br /><br />And that system is The Matrix.
