This is one heck of great movie. The special effects are its high points
and
its action scenes deliver a new style to Hollywood films. I think that the
effect of having a character freeze on the screen, then having the camera
pan around them is an amazing concept. The slowed bullets and the ripple
of
air behind them set a new standard of suspense that can be integrated into
all types of movies. The story line was wicked and thought provoking. The
use of guns in this movie gave it its special identity from many other
movies. And I just love the style the Agents had, especially Agent Smith.
However I don't think Trinity was that good looking but at least she was a
good actor.
