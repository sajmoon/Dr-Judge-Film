Wow...that's the only thing you can begin to muster up after this movie. I'm
serious, it's true. This movie defies all sorts of rules- gravitational, or
otherwise. The special effects kick butt, and the characters are both
believeable and alter-reality-type-of-cool. While many people believe this
to be a copy of other movies, I think it's very original. Andy and Larry are
wonderful, and I think their movie will become very well-known and special
(like it isn't already, hehe). I own this movie, and someday I'll go back
and watch it with some of my friends. We've already made many movies where
we reanacted some of the scenes. :)
