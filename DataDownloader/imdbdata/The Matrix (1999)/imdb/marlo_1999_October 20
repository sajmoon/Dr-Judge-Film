1999_October 20 

The matrix is by far the greatest action movie that I have seen in a very
long time.  I love the fact that its purpose was purely to search and
destroy, as so many action movies are.  I like the fact that it has a
philosophical side to it that leaves it's viewers with something to think
about besides people getting blown away, and buildings destroyed.  Also that
in the end all we know is that the &quot;good guys&quot; were a step ahead, but there
was no guarentee that they would win, so to speak.
