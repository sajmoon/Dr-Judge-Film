This film is just wonderful! I don't like sci-fi very much, but as Keanu
was
in this one, I HAD to see it...and I loved it! The actors, Keanu and
Carrie-Anne were just wonderful, the movie keeps your attention all the
time, and you are almost unable to breathe the whole movie. If you want
adrenaline, go on and see it because it's really worth!
