1999_September 15 

I for one thought it was the most cliche-riddled piece of garbage to emerge
from Hollywood, er, since the last cliche-riddled piece of garbage. The plot
appeared to have been assembled on a computerised production line from
recycled pieces of left over script. The gun-fetish element was obscene,
even by current Hollywood standards and even the central premise - that
computers had decided to use humans as a cheap and plentiful power source -
was so paper-thin that it was delivered almost as a throwaway line. There
were several times when I nearly walked out, it got so bad. And, to cap it
all, near the end there was a scene that was just so cliched that I
completely lost it and started laughing uncontrollably....<br /><br />3/10 for effort....
