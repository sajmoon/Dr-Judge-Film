I have heard so much about the Matrix and finally watched it for the first
time this weekend.<br /><br />Boy, were there lots of action sequences. Lots and lots and lots of action
sequences. You can feel the filmmakers just trying to top the last
sequence
instead of doing something like advancing the plot or developing the
characters. Unless you think the action sequence is the be-all-and-end-all
of movies, all that action just gets boring after a while. I have nothing
against whiz-bang special effects as long as they do something worthwhile
to
move the film along (the Lord of the Rings films are good at this). But
this
is just not happening with the Matrix.<br /><br />The Matrix concept itself is thought-provoking. Why isn't it developed
more?
The fact that this monumental struggle for the soul of humanity ends up
with
a shoot-out, a helicopter-dangling rescue sequence and a martial arts
fight
is almost laughable. It's like saying the mysteries of the universe can be
unraveled by watching beer commercials. If you want to see an ending that
leaves you with something worth chewing on, you'll be sadly disappointed
(as
I was).<br /><br />As for other elements of the movie -- Keanu Reeves, as much as I usually
enjoy watching him, was extremely wooden. Fishburne and Moss were good at
what they did, but their parts were pretty two-dimensional. I couldn't get
emotionally involved with any of the characters, which is ultimately the
fault of the writers. The cinematography and &quot;style&quot; of the film and the
sets is pretty cool to look at. However, the whole black clothes and
sunglasses motif is just a little bit hokey after a while. And the
agents --
I swear they look just like the bad aliens in Brother From Another
Planet --
I kept expecting them to shriek at each other.<br /><br />I look at it this way - people who think that sitting in front of their
tubes and playing video games is a worthwhile way to spend their lives
will
probably love this movie. People who want something more will think it's
pretty hollow. It's a shame because the concept had a lot of potential,
but
the filmmakers took the easy way out.
