1999_October 31 

In brief, this is one of the best, if not the best, film ever made.  This
film has action, special effects and an excellent sound track; brilliant!
I
can not wait for the sequels;  this trilogy should kick the s**t out of the
barely average Star-Wars Trilogy to come (ie. extremely poor acting, plot
and some of the most unrealistic special effects since Buck
Rogers!)
