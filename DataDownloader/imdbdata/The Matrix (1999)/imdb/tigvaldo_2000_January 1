I liked this film. See it, but please take this Hollywood interpretation
of
machine intelligence with a pinch of salt (lime and tequila are
optional).<br /><br />The Matrix makes you think in that annoying way, like Blade Runner did.
You
start ripping little holes in the fabric of the film, just because a few
your friends are selling it as the best SF film in the world
ever.<br /><br />Remember kids, we as humans fear most that what we have inflicted upon
ourselves and other creatures. It doesn't follow that AI will be used to
create evil machines that will enslave us.<br /><br />Sofa rating: 9/10 - top skill!
Under the spotlight: 6/10 - just scraped the Turin test<br /><br />tig
