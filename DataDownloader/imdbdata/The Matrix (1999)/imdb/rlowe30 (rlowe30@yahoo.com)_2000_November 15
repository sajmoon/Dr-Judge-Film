Fantastic movie that really only works when your sound system is excellent.
I've watched this one at least ten times, and the difference in the
experience is remarkable.  I've never known a movie to hinge so much on its
sound quality.
Beautifully, hypnotically photographed, in a comic book storyboard style.
Keanu is surrounded by top notch actors, and he rocks as Neo.  So what if
the philosophy here is half-baked New Ageism; suspend your Critic and Listen
to this fun action feast.
