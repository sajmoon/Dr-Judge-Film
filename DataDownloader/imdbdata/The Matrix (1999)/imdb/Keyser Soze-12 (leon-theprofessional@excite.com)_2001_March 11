Okay, I liked the Matrix.  Hell, I loved it.  But it does not, NOT IN A
MILLION YEARS, deserve to be number 38 on the top 250 list!  It is not that
good.  Okay, the special effects are great.  The action is superb.  Okay,
the plot is good and so are the characters.  I am not calling it bad.  But
anyone who votes this movie a ten out of ten has no movie education.  The
Matrix is just a phase.  It's a fad.  Twenty years from now, will it still
be on this list?  I don't think so.  How dare you people put this movie in
front of Das Boot, Raging Bull, Fight Club, Almost Famous, and Apocalypse
Now.<br /><br />Okay, I do love the Matrix, but come on, giving the movie a 10 out of 10 is
saying you wanted the movie to win best picture!  I know that the top 250
list is the best list in the world because it takes EVERYONES vote.  It's
not a bunch of old geezers in the AFI; it's anyone and everyone.  But,
please people, think before you vote.<br /><br />7/10
