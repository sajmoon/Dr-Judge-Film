Interesting plot line, nice plot twists, leather, guns and boffo effects,
yeah, the Matrix has that.  But having seen Alex Proyas' movie _Dark City_
a
year earlier, I expected a lot more and ended up disappointed.<br /><br />When I left the theatre after Dark City, I left with questions about the
nature of my reality, marvelling at how well Proyas had mapped to the
symbols in my subconscious, and yes, how delicious the film looked.  But
with the Matrix, the only thought I was left with was:  Hm, that was fun.
It never gave me the sense leaving the theatre, &quot;Oh my God, what if all
this
is a simulation?&quot; because of the unbelievable plot twists like using
humans
as &quot;bioelectric energy sources&quot;.  Why not use cows or dogs or rats-- they
won't rebel, you don't have to make up a complicated world for them to
inhabit, and they put out plenty of bioelectricity.  No story,
though.<br /><br />So, bottom line:  a fun romp, but won't grab your mind by the
gonads...
