Let me say, first off, that I really enjoyed this movie and it is a great
way to kill off a couple of hours. The movie has an interesting plot and
some fantasticly developed action sequences. That whole bullet-time scene is
just too cool to put in print. But anyone saying that this movie is original
has got to get out more. The story has been done countless times before and
the action can be summarized into two words: JOHN WOO..!!. This movie would
not have been made if it wasn't for Mr. Woo's influence on modern cinema.
That whole scene in the security building with the slo-mo shots of Keanu
Reeves holding a gun in each hand, while wearing cool clothes and not to
mention the shades, just screams out WOO..!!( and yes I am a Woo fanatic ).<br /><br />Overall this a really good piece of cinema. It just happens to steal or
*borrow* alot from other, more original movie masterpieces. It's just sad to
think from now on that any other movie that uses slo-mo in it's action
scenes will be hailed as a Matrix rip-off. Can anyone say M:I-2?
