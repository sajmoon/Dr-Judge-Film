1999_August 20 

I've seen this film three times on the big screen thus far and I'm already
thinking of planning my next trip. This film just blows you away with an all
out style fest and a decent plot which while borrowing elements from loads
of other films (Terminator, Dark City and Total Recall spring to mind) still
manages to retain an incredible freshness over proceedings. I can't
criticise anything about the film, except possibly the cheesy Kung-Fu poses
that Keanu Reeves manages to maintain - whether this was deliberate or not
I'm not so sure. <br /><br />The action is incredible, the effects are fantastic and the whole sound just
hits you full on. I also loved the peculiar diction of the enemy agents -
very cool. All the main characters evolve as the film developes, making the
film much more than just a 'beat em up'. The plot, while relatively easy to
grasp is still 'there', it's not as complex as a lot of people seem to make
out but is just about right for an action movie that has got so many other
things that grab your attention, like Carrie Ann Moss's (Trinity) figure
hugging outfit and immense first fight scene. <br /><br />This is probably THE film which will make me go out and buy a DVD /
Widescreen TV home movie set - it deserves never to be watched on anything
less.......
