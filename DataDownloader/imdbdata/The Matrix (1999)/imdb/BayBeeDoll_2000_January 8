This has got to be one of the best sci-fi movies ever made. The special
effects are unbelievable.. Loved the scene where Keanue is dodging those
bullets... it was so cool. And who knew Keanu Reeves could kung fu fight
like that???  :) He could give Jackie Chan a run for his money..:) Who
knows, maybe we will see them teamed up together in a kung fu movie  :)
Wouldn't that be somewhat unexpected, even funny.. :) I just love a great
movie..
