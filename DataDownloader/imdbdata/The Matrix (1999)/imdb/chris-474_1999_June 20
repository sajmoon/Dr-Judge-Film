1999_June 20 

The Matrix displayed a lot of depth script wise and acting wise. I enjoyed
it immensely and found it to be very interesting which is something found
rarely in this time of making movies in a month without caring if the
audience will actually like the movie. The Matrix also has a great last 45
minutes of action which is similar but better than hackers. the acting was
great because each member of the cast really cared about this movie, you
could tell. They cared so much that the movie took almost a year to make.
I
recommend this film to everyone and if you can see it in the cinema it
will
be worthwhile.
