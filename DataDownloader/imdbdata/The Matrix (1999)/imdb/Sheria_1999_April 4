1999_April 4 

Don't let the dismal storyline (or Keanu Reeves' notoriously wooden acting)
dissuade you from seeing this movie. It is great fun! Wonderfully
suspenseful, action-packed, and even funny!! The fact that the humor springs
from scenes where the actors deliver their lines in serious-as-a-heart-attack
dead-pan makes it all the more funny. The stars went through physical
training for 6 months and sustained injuries in making this film. If you see
The Matrix, you will have no trouble believing that!
