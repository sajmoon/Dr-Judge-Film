matrix is one good film!people don't seem to understand, the plot of it
and
i have no idea why, because it is completely obvious. people say they have
to watch it about 3 or 2 times before they understand it, i saw it once
and
thought that was excellent.  At first people thought it was great but now
that the film is a little older they seem to regard it as boring and
useless, why do they change their minds?????it is still a good
film.
the story line for example is remarkable and it does get people wondering
about if there really is a matrix, and if so can we free our mind.<br /><br />I felt keanu reeves complemented the film with harmony and directness, it
gave the film a sense of achievement.  Lawrence Fishbourne was also a
sight
of perfectness, and his whole role fitted in nicely.  however i did feel
that there was absolutely no need for them to build up characters of
switch,
apoc, tank and mouse when there lives were destined to die immediately or
instantaniously.
in conclusion it is a classic film and will live on to be one of the
greatest and so will the following two films to follow then it will make a
complete trilgoy, something to look forward to!
