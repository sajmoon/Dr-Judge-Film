1999_September 15 

As a computer programmer I was pleased with the way certain aspects of
computer programming was represented.  I especially liked the way that the
&quot;code&quot; was visualized.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys
computers, altered aspects of reality, and a good conspiracy.
