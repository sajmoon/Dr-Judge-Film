THE MATRIX is an masterful blend of Hong Kong-style Kung Fu, William
Gibsonesque cyberpunk, and hyperkinetic John Woo gunplay -- with a
generous
dash of the existentialist paranoia of Philip K. Dick and Franz Kafka just
to keep things interesting! THE MATRIX is the most compelling,
mind-bending,
and entertaining movie I've seen in years, one of the few films of the 90s
I've seen more than six times, each time revealing a deeper level of
complexity. The cast is pretty good (even professional wooden Indian Keanu
Reeves, who's actually -- and surprisingly -- above-average in this film),
the special effects are dazzling and beautiful, the direction is amazing
(a
synthesis of the best techniques of John Woo and James Cameron, it seems),
and the over-all look and design of the movie is attractive in a dark,
ominous kind of way (the world outside the matrix reminded me of something
H.R. Giger of
ALIEN fame might have designed).<br /><br />The film isn't flawless, however. In the interest of constructive
criticism
here are some of my pet peeves: dialogue which rarely transcends the
perfunctory, minimal character development, and Trinity's diminished (and
subordinate) role in the second and third acts, which was surprising to me
considering Bros. Wachowski's excellent treatment of female characters in
their debut film, BOUND (another excellent movie, IMHO).<br /><br />Bring on Matrix 2 and 3, Andy and Larry!<br /><br />3 1/2 out of 4 stars / 9 out of 10 / Thumbs Up ... Way
Up!<br /><br />
