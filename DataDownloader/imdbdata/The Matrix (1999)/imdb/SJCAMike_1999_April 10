1999_April 10 

I went to see the Matrix thinking it would be a cool science fiction film,
with lots of interesting twists. It turned out to be mostly an action film
with some nice fight scenes, more along the lines of a Chuck Norris or
Jackie Chan film. I am a big science fiction fan, and I was a little
disappointed that the film wasn't more interesting, but I enjoyed it
anyway.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves looked good as always, but didn't achieve any kind of epiphany
or express much human emotion (also as usual, unfortunately.) I would really
like to see him increase his emotional range and expressiveness. Without it,
he's just too 2D.
