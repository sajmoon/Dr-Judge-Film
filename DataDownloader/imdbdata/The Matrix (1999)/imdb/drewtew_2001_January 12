Like most sci-fi, The Matrix isn't as much character-driven as it is plot
or
premise-driven... and what a premise!  Existentialism meets hard-core
action
and mayhem in a fantasy cross-time epic!  If you are looking for some
Liberal heart-bleeding and introspection, you are clearly watching the
wrong
movie... but if you want a railroad train of action, guns, and
destruction,
turn the volume up, the lights down, and buckle your seat
belt!<br /><br />The scripting (and acting) varies widely from less than adequate to almost
profound so be prepared to be a little forgiving in the weaker moments.
Reeves plays his character nearly drone-like, but that only works in the
movie's favour... allowing the viewer to insert his own persona into Neo's
with a minimum of friction.  Fishburne takes a character riddled with
plot-holes and inconsistencies and fleshes him out as dominant and
interesting.  The others?  Well, I TRIED to tell you this wasn't a
character-driven movie...  A notable stand-out is Hugo Weaving's portrayal
of the bad guy, &quot;Agent Smith.&quot;  Thoroughly convincing even during the
worst
of his diatribes (what's with that whole virus thing?  Rodents are
mammals,
and in the absence of predation they also will reproduce well beyond their
environment's ability to support them).<br /><br />An MTV gothic atmosphere pervades the movie, and the nearly stop-action
editing of the fight scenes makes even the most fantastic maneuver
believable!  The often unusual camera angles and centers of focus meld the
action perfectly to the premise of the unreality of existence and the
computerised enhancements blend in precisely to form overwhelmingly
satisfying fight-sequence experiences.<br /><br />And the premise... Is it better to live in real poverty and squaller as a
truly free man, or to live in illusory comfort as a slave?  Do you care?
If
your idealist streak is stronger than your materialist one, you may truly
get something more out of this experience than what shows on the surface
of
this film.  And if you are a fan of Richard Bach (Jonathon Livingston
Seagull, Illusions, etc.)  you just may have a religious experience in
watching The Matrix.<br /><br />Yes, this really IS among the best sci-fi movies ever made!
