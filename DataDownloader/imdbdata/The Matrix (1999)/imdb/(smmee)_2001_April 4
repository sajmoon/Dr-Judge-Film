THE MATRIX has great special effects and a good script. No
joke.
Where on earth people got the impression that it was #39 of the top 250
greatest films of all time (while E.T. sits near the end, rotting) is beyond
me. It's just a bad movie. It attempts to be intelligent and existential,
but it constantly wavers between action-adventure and intelligent film. Only
people like Spielberg, Hitchcock, Kurosawa, etc, have managed this
successfully. This movie's theories are generally typical, teen-angst pieces
of &quot;what am I?&quot;. The special effects and production values don't save the
movie.
