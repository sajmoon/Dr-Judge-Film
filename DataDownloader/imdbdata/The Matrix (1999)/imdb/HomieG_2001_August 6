The Matrix is a  comic book like film that should've won 1999's best picture
award at the Oscars.  If you haven't seen the film, see it!  This film has
probably the best imagery ever seen in an American film ever!  Keanu Reeves'
wooden acting doesn't even hamper the movie!  It actually gives it a type of
comic feel.  The special effects are awesome and the actors look cool doing
it.  Every time there's a fight scene, it seems fresh and original.  This
was the first time I'd seen wire work period.  Wire work is also utilized
well in the foreign film &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; which was also
robbed of the Best Picture Oscar. This is the one action/sci-fi film no
movie library should be without.  10/10
