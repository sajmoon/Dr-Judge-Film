2001_September 28 

The special effects are undeniably stunning and ground-breaking with four
technical oscars to back that up but the film is hollow trash. Keanu Reeves
is humiliated by the vastly superior acting of the furniture and films that
rely on special effects are almost always bad with the exception of &quot;star
Wars&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. I can't believe this film
is on the Top 250 list!!!!
