1999_April 6 

This was a fun, action packed movie to watch with special effects that
were
fantastic.<br /><br />I kept flashing back to 2 other similar movies, though, one even starring
Keanu: Lawnmower Man, and Johnny Mnemonic. I guess that just goes to show
that in the matrix, parallel worlds do exist...<br /><br />
