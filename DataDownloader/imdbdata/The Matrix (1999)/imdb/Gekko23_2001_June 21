<br /><br />I too cannot believe all of the negative reviews I've been reading on
this film.  People, this is SCI-FI, not a documentary on the mating habits
of giraffes in sub-Saharan African.  I mean, for crying out loud, can you
not suspend your high-mind, self-righteous cynicism for 2 hours and
just enjoy a good movie when you see one?   I mean geeeeeeeeeeeez.<br /><br />What the hell is this about plausibility?  Plausibilty?  Come on!
Like
Terminator 2 is plausible?  Or how about Star Wars, where they all these
planets with the exact gravitational force and atmospheric environment of
the earth?  If plausibility were ever a measure by which to enjoy a movie,
damn near all movies would fall by the wayside.<br /><br />This was one helluva movie.  Everything, from the breathtaking fight
scenes, special effects, to the storyline was simply awesome.  It was one
of
those groundbreaking movies that we'll still be watching in 20 years.<br /><br />Here's hoping the sequels are not another Phantom Fiasco.<br /><br />LONG LIVE THE MATRIX!!!!!!!!!!
