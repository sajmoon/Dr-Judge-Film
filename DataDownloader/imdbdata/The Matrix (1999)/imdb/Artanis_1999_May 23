1999_May 23 

The movie is just great for people who don't care much about a clear
storyline,and reasonable action,but for the ones who love comic books and
all..is a awesome movie.Great special effects,action scenes,and requires
some brain use to understand about the Matrix :)
For me,specially,I really really loved the Morpheus rescue part..lots and
lots of action..for you all..this is a must see movie.
