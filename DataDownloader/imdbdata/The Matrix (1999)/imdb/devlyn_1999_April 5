1999_April 5 

I saw &quot;The Matrix&quot; on opening day and again three days later.  Any good
movie, especially one as complex in message, plot and visuals, should be
viewed more than once.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the previews for this film the first time I saw them.
They filled me with a lot of questions, mainly, what in the world is this
about?  All of my questions were answered.<br /><br />&quot;The Matrix&quot; is one wild ride that makes a person question what is real and
what is the intangible construct of our imagination.  How much of what we
see and experience is the truth, and how much is only our perception of the
data we are bombarded by and required to process every
day?<br /><br />The script was beautifully constructed, the dialog just what was necessary
to relay plot and character.  The performances were a joy to watch, easily
allowing the viewer to suspend disbelief.  The baddies were spooky,
evocative of the mysterious men in black characters traveling in threes that
people into government/alien conspiracy claim really do exist in our world.
The music was so well applied that I barely noticed it (as great soundtracks
should be) as it wove its way though the visuals, underscoring the
mood.<br /><br />I was floored when Mr. Smith (a baddie) commented about humans not fitting
into their environment, being a cancer on the planet.  I've believed this
for years.  Did the writers of this movie read my mind?<br /><br />And, how could I not comment specifically on Keanu Reeves' performance.
I've enjoyed his work for quite some time.  In this movie, as in others, he
is excellent at playing confused, misplaced and, in the end, victorious
characters.  As Neo he struggles well with accepting his reality and his
place in the scheme of things.  I'd give his performance in this, on a scale
of one to ten (10 being the best), about an 8 1/2.<br /><br />Lawrence Fishburn was enthralling as the rather somber, patient, nurturing
mentor, Morpheus.  Carrie-Anne Moss was wonderful as Trinity.  The rest of
the supporting cast rounded out the film with style.<br /><br />&quot;The Matrix&quot; reminded me of other films I enjoyed: &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; (in
which the main character was also 'plugged-in') and &quot;Dark
City&quot;.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed this movie, and when it's available on video I'll add it to
my very selective collection of special movies to enjoy over and over.<br /><br />What is real and what is imagined?  Maybe this review only exists in my
mind.  Maybe this movie is only a construct of my warped fantasies.  If
that's the case, I invite you in to share it.
