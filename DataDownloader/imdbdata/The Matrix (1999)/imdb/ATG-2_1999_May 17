The Matrix was by far one of the best films that I have ever seen!  From
the
beginning to end I was on the edge of my seat.  It had lots of action in
the
movie and it was so sci-fi and weird. I loved the camera shots.  I think
that
every one should see this movie even if you do not like sci-fi movies.  I
can
not wait till this movie comes out on video so I can buy it. Keanu Reeves
and Laurence Fishburne are great!<br /><br />
