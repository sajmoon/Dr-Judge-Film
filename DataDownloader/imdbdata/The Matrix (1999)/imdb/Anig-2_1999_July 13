This movie is truly an essay in superlatives: the acting, story-line,
direction, special effects, sound effects, music, editing, and overall
feel
of the film are all stunning. There are so many arcane mythological
references that even Umberto Eco would have difficulty in understanding
all
of them. You have to concentrate while watching, but the experience is
unforgettable. All people with an open mind must see this movie,
preferably
on the big screen.
