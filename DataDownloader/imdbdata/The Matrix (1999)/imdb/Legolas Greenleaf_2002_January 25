The simple fact is, the special effects carried this movie!  The action
sequences were astounding, but were followed by some of the worst 'acting'
Ive ever seen!  Lets face it, Keanu Reeves could be out-acted by a cabbage! 
Carrie-Anne Moss isnt much better!  The only real actors in this movie were
Joe Pantoliano (from Sopranoes), Paul Goddard (from Farscape) and Laurence
Fishburne who played Morpheous!<br /><br />The idea wasnt really that original, machines taking over the planet, oh
yeah God how original.  Luckily, the Wachowski's are very talented directors
and managed to give it a bit of potential.  When looking at the genre
'Action/Thiller/Sci-Fi' I just have to laugh and ask &quot;why isnt it filed
under comedy for Keanu Reeves acting, he's like another Ben Afflick who
cannot act&quot;  Everyone in the movie managed to outact Keanu, including the
props which were much more realistic than his acting. <br /><br />Lets hope someone gave him some acting lessons before the next movies in the
Matrix Saga are made, otherwise, they will be as god-awful as this
was!<br /><br />Overall, 5/10 for me, and those are only for special effects!
