Have you seen it yet? No, then get of your rear an go and see
it! One of the greatest films around! Superb! A film that combines the
world of sci-fi with the world of martial arts in
the last great film of the Millennium! Thoroughly enjoyed the film, I just
loved the fight sequences. See it to believe it!
