Wow.  This is definitely my new all-time favorite film.  It's the fantasy of
&quot;The Never-Ending Story&quot; mixed with the techno-thrills aspects of &quot;Hackers,&quot;
the hair-raising science-fiction qualities of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; that
made us really made us wonder whether computers could be our evolutionary
successors, the special effects that made &quot;Independence Day&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot;
so intriguing, the combat that leaves us in awe of people like Jackie Chan,
the dark elements of &quot;The Crow,&quot; and Lawrence Fishburne's sheer talent of
being the ultimate &quot;badass.&quot;  As others have said, this is a movie that
needs to be seen at least twice to appreciate not only the immediately
apparent qualities, but also the inherent complexities, hints, and
foreshadowing that were all missed the first time as you were trying to
figure things out.   Thought-provoking, indeed.  &quot;Episode I&quot; better be at
least this good.
