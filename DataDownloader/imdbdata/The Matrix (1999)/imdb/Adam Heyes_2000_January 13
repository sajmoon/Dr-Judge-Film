This film almost literally kicks you in the teeth to gain your attention.
Forget about all the blue pill/red pill, &quot;What is the Matrix&quot; nonsense,
which is all just a badly plotted excuse for some action.  And that is
where
the film excels.<br /><br />The camera work and effects blend together beautifully, sweeping around
people in the air and such like.  The dialogue is wonderfully cheesy at
times (&quot;We need guns, lots of guns&quot;) but you really forgive all flaws when
the music kicks in and the next big action scene begins.<br /><br />There is one flaw too far though: Keanu Reeves really is awful, he
couldn't
act hurt if you kicked him in the groin.  This is the main annoyance about
an otherwise good-if-you-can-remove-your-brain sort of film.  Also,
remember, if your watching this at home expect to be disappointed unless
you
have a good sound set-up, it really isn't the same otherwise.
