This movie was not only very original in its taste but also a first of
a
kind. The 'Die Hard' shootout action scenes have been dying out very
quickly
and the computer generated action is coming in to play.<br /><br />I really don't have much more to say. It was superb and will be
remembered that way for years and years to come. There was great acting,
cool effects, and not to mention the message...<br /><br />Speaking of the message, this is the only thing about this movie that
is
not original. In fact, it is as unoriginal as it gets. Its the BIBLE! Neo
gets 'awakened'. Morpheus 'dies' and 'rejuvinates'. This one will prove
it:
at the end Neo rises. He rises. Remind you of anything?? Everyone wonders
why he did that and that is the answer. It is based on the
Bible.
