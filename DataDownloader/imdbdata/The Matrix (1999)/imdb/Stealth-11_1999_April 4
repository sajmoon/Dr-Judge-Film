1999_April 4 

One of the best movies in years.  Unfortunately it has been slighted by
people with a bias against action/sci-fi movies, as well as against Keanu
Reeves.  However, do not let that talk dissuade you from experiencing this
movie.  A great and thought-provoking story, combined with outstanding
visual effects, make this one of the most unique and masterful movies
released in recent years.
