2001_September 9 

It seemed a little slow at first, but near the middle I was beginning to
realize that this film was one of the best and most creative action movies
ever made. All the actors were great. It took me, however, several times
seeing it over and over until I fully understood what the Matrix was. This
film kept me squirming in my seat the whole way through. I've seen many
action films, but this one is my favorite. The CGI was very impressive,
along with all the other special effects. But all the action wasn't the only
thing that had me interested. The setting, acting, and script were all close
to perfect. Keanu Reeves, being one of my favorite actors, did a great job
as Neo. Laurence Fishburne also did a great job. All the main characters had
unique attitudes and personalities. I give this movie a 9 out of
10.
