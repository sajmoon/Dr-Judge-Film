1999_April 5 

Oh man, here I am waiting desperately for Star Wars to come out, and am
suddenly blindsided by what is very probably the best movie I have seen
since &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (which is my favorite movie
ever).  It is, if taken in its primal essence, an unsurpassed paranoia
movie.  However, as anyone who plays the game Mage: The Ascension can
attest:  It was good to see those Virtual Adepts giving those uppity
Technocrats a good beat-down!  World of Darkness fans, this movie is a
must-see.  Everyone else, go see it anyway.  It is just that
good. <br /><br />Miki
