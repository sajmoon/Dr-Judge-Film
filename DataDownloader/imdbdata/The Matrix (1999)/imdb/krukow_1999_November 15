1999_November 15 

Now I've seen this film 3 times and each time I learn and understand more
about it. I don't know why it captures me so. It makes me think about the
world we live in and our place in it. The creators have imagined a totally
plausible alternate plane of existence that these characters exist in and
makes you wonder if we are all being pulled by some invisible strings. I for
one liked Keanu Reeves performance, it needed to be understated because of
what is about to be thrust upon him. The special EFX are outstanding and
Carrie-Ann Moss is out of this world (Cool leather duds). I will be watching
this film again and I can't wait for Matrix 2.
