1999_April 4 

A number of other commentators have noted that this film calls Philip K.
Dick to mind (probably thinking of &quot;We Can Remember it for You Wholesale&quot;
which was made into &quot;Total Recall&quot;).<br /><br />Actually, it reminds me very much of Fritz Leiber's &quot;You're All Alone&quot; which
Leiber also rewrote as &quot;The Sinful Ones.&quot;  For anyone who liked The Matrix,
I would recommend reading either or both of those stories, and Leiber in
general.<br /><br />A few complained about the screenplay or plot, but I thought it was very
enjoyable all around, and found the &quot;exposition scenes&quot; to be helpful, and
not tedious at all.<br /><br />The effects are just amazing, though, and that's the main reason why I went
to see it, just like with &quot;What Dreams May Come,&quot; which also had amazing
effects.  I wouldn't be surprised to see a Jackie Chan movie employing the
&quot;bullet time&quot; effect in the future as well...in fact, I hope we
will.
