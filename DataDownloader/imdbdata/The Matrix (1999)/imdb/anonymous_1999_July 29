1999_July 29 

I have read in magazines that this has taken the mantle from Blade Runner as
the best sci-fi flick ever. I think Matrix is good (best film in 99) but I
don't think it is better than Blade Runner for a couple of reasons.<br /><br />1. The story in the matrix was in the end pretty much find special kid,
train him up, he wins the day. <br /><br />2. The sets and the acting on Blade Runner were far superior<br /><br />3. The bad guys in the matrix were not particularly scary and to be honest
their were pretty boring <br /><br />4. Blade Runner had more levels to the plot and the characters than Matrix
which was just an action flick<br /><br />But this is not to say I didn't like the movie I thought it was great,
although I didn't understand what happened at the end. They use music in the
film excellently the acting is pretty good and the fighting and action
scenes are some of the best put to film. The slow camera feature is used to
good effect in the film and because this film was a hit expect to see a lot
more of it.
