1999_June 18 

Although you can't be completely objective the day after you've
experienced
something
I'd have to say that this has to be one the best movies I have ever seen!
It
has the music (LOUD!), it has the actors (COOL!), it has the effects
(UNBELIEVABLE!) but most of all it has that wonderful &quot;None Of This Is
True&quot;
angle.<br /><br />If you've ever found yourself at the end of a good party talking to
someone
and discussing the possibility that the world is designed just to fool you
and none if this is really happening, you will know what I mean. It
usually
leads to the question: &quot;If the world is created specially for ME, will YOU
disappear once you walk out of site?&quot;<br /><br />A friend and I where already p****d that they stole &quot;our&quot; idea to make
&quot;The
Truman Show&quot; but now The Wachowski Brothers gave us the change to watch
our
paranoia in a +2 hour during rollercoaster ride and I was blown away!
Forget
Star Wars and go see this movie!<br /><br />
