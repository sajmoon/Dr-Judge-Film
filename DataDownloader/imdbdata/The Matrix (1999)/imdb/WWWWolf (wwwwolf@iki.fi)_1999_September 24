1999_September 24 

I had high expectations for this film. People who had
seen the movie came out and spoke gibberish about pills
and spoons, and reviews painted pictures of extremely nice
SF movie with rich philosophical content.
And after I saw the trailer, I knew I had to see this movie
at all costs. And, I must say, it definitely was worth
it.<br /><br />Matrix is, as I mentioned, a mind-blowing experience - you
just
have to see it to believe it. &quot;No one can be told what
the
Matrix is, you have to see it for yourself&quot; - and I might
add,
no one can guess beforehand what kind of experience the
movie is, you *really* have to see it for yourself. Words
can hardly describe all of it.
