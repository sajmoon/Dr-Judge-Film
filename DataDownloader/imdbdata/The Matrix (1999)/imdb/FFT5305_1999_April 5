1999_April 5 

The Matrix is a very good movie.  The plot is derivative, but good.  The
acting ranges from passable (Keanu Reeves) to good (everyone else).  What
sets this movie apart from all others is the visual effects.  I have never
seen anything like the action sequences in The Matrix... Stunningly
original.  From the opening scene of the movie, we are given one
breathtaking sequence after another.  Word of warning, though -- it is a bit
campy.  I think it would have played better as straight action, but if a
little corniness is expected, it can be enjoyed, so realize that going in.
If you are expecting a profound movie about the meaning of life, you're at
the wrong movie.  If you want an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours,
you'd be hard pressed to find a better movie currently in the
theatres.
