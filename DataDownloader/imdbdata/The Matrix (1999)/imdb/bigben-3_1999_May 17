1999_May 17 
<br /><br />An excellent, non-stop sci-fi action ever. Keanu Reeves, and the rest
of
the cast delivers a stand out performances. Fighting scenes, were great
and
will leave you breathless. Visual and sound effects are one of a kind ,
and
will really take you off to the edge. The story is not spoon-fed on this
film, but as it progresses, you'll have the wildest idea of what's going
on.
If you are into some sci-fi action, Well, buckle up, this is going to
be
some ride!
