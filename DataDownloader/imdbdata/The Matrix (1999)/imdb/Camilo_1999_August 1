The movie is great.  There are some details, hard to understand, that make
the movie even better.  For example, for us martial arts fans,  it was
incredible to see how Neo's kung-fu related directly to Bruce Lee's (for
example, the part when he gets the blood off his mouth, and moves his hand.
Its the exact move Bruce does in the movie &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;).  There is
another example:  Has anybody thought about why is Morpheus named that way,
just as the ancient Greek &quot;Dream God&quot;?
These are the kind of things directors introduce, and not many people
see.<br /><br />Another great thing, is the clothing. Its excellent!  I think it got most of
my attention.
