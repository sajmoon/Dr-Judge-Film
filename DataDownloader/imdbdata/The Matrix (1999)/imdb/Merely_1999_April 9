1999_April 9 

The great trailer for this one got me there, and it didn't disappoint. Eye
candy at its finest. If you're thinking of waiting for this one on
video...don't. It really should be seen in the theatre. In fact, I hope that
it is re-released someday just to have the experience again. But most likely
it will change how films are made and other great &quot;matrix&quot; like movies will
come along. Great effects, great soundtrack, great everything. It's not your
father's Oldsmoblie.<br /><br />Don't be too hard on Keanu...he was born to play this role.
Would have given it a 10 but not for that goofy ending.
