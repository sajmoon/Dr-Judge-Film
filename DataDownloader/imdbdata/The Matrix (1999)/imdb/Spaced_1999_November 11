The Matrix is an incredible movie and destined to be one of my favorites.
The action, acting, story are great but by far, the most amazing aspect is
how it parallels that of a Christian walk of life, from realizing what the
world really is to dealing with it all and letting others know.  From the
Matrix being the world as we know, one which is filled with things from
worldly obsessions to keeping busy.  Both the &quot;Matrix&quot; and the world keep
us
blinded from the real truth.  Neo represents a man who has realized that
something is wrong with the world.  At first he wants to know what it is,
when he realizes it he finds that he doesn't want to believe it.  He's been
tricked his entire life.  The story goes on through his transformation.
Other parallels would be Agent Smith-Satan, the tempter (as we all know he
does in the movie), Sypher-betrayed everyone as did Judas Iscariot.  There
is an incredible amount more, it's amazing.  99% of the movie has something
to do with the Christian walk and those involved.  I suggest next time you
watch it to keep your eyes and mind open.
