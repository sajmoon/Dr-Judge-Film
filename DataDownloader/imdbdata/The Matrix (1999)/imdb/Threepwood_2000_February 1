2000_February 1 

This movie sets the gold standard for all action and sci-fi movies to come.
The story was good, the acting well-tuned, and the special effects were
mind-boggling. The scene in the police station takes violence and turns it
into a work of art. The camera work was spectacular to say the least with
the 3D rotational stuff. This movie is destined to become a perennial
favorite.
