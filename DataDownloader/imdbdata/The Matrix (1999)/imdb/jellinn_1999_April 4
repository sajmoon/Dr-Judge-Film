1999_April 4 

It's what you pay full price to go see!  Fast action martial arts,
techno/freaky sound trak, a make ya think story (Coppertop-thats funny), and
the crowd seemed quite pleased with much giggling and ooohs and aaaahs!
Keanu duzn't have to do too much dramatic acting, and that is a good plus.
The FX are incredabibble--just soooo explative kewl.  Go see it, its
definitely worth the $$<br /><br />Similarities:<br /><br />-Dark City (but way better/makes more sense)<br /><br />-Virtuosity (this compoopter world VR thing)<br /><br />-A Walk in the Clouds(Keanu's sensitive side shows--Haahaa I  make
funny!)
