While watching this movie the audience is supposed to join the position of
Neo, the freedom fighter, the elected, the one, the saviour of human kind
blablabla and his nice company... but, I mean, how the heck can you
disagree
with Agent Smith when he says:
-- &quot; [...] Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural
equilibrium with the surrounding environment, but you humans do not. You
move to an area, and you multiply, and multiply, until every natural
resource is consumed. The only way you can survive is to spread to another
area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same
pattern. A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet, you
are a plague [...] &quot; --<br /><br />Ok, you can be the typical egoistic/egocentric/selfish type of guy who
thinks that humans have the right of exploiting everything just 'cause
they
can do it, but still you must admit that the (supposedly) bad-guy of the
movie is speaking the truth there.<br /><br />Then again he says:
-- &quot;Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human
world? Where none suffered, where everyone would be happy. It was a
disaster. No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost. Some
believed we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect
world.
But I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality
through
suffering and misery. The perfect world was a dream that your primitive
cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. Which is why the Matrix was
redesigned
to this: the peak of your civilization.&quot; --<br /><br />I found myself smiling at this, have you ever noticed the way some ppl
without any apparent reason to be unhappy invent some problems they
actually
have not, create some paranoia or exaggerate little things just to waste
their time in troubles? Ha!Ha! More than once I heard somebody saying the
world would be a boredom if everything was right, no thrill, no
revolutionary ideals to spread, no fights, no enemies to crush... I see
Agent Smith is right once again, human beings find their way to progress
by
taking how more distance is possible from nature, and sophisticating their
tastes and needs, that's why the best Matrix is just a copy of one of ours
(supposedly) more evolved civilizations, with all its faults.<br /><br />I couldn't avoid to sympathize with Agent Smith, also because NEO is
definitely an unpleasant character with all his self-complacency,
haughtiness and conceit, urged and encouraged to this by his similarly
unpleasant company.
Are you thinking machines here are blameworthy for the way they use
humans?
At least they induce us in a realistic dream of a real life, we don't do
the
same with all the animals we grow jailed, we puff-up and then we slaughter
for our pleasure. (PLEASURE, not survival, 'cause we don't need to eat
meat
to live, we just do it because we like it).<br /><br />So, IMO this movie has a pretty stimulating plot filled with annoying
Hollywood-type exaggerate action... all in all I rate it a 6&frac12; out of 10,
'cause it's entertaining and offers some cues for a reflection.
