1999_April 11 

This movie starts with an intriguing story.  Albeit, not
really
anything new, I had high hopes for this film to rank highly in my personal
movie favorites list.  The style of the movie is really the best feature,
something one could expect to be repeated in the coming millenium.
Lawrence
Fishburn's portrayal is well done
and somewhat understated.  In fact, all the roles are understated.  I
believe this was purposeful because the Producer
was hoping to acheive big box office totals based on the
special
effects and look of the movie.  In other words, they didn't want to
detract
from the main selling points by bothering with a coherent storyline or
anyone actually acting in this movie.  I thought it was somewhat bland
because of this.  Keannu Reeves is just not a very good
actor. The plot degenerates suddenly into a love story to save the
day. This plot twist actually made me laugh out loud!  It just
seemed out of place, with no reason to occur.  The kung fu aspect of the
storyline
was also laughable.
If he is the one, I don't want to be on the team. In fact I
stopped rooting for the &quot;heroes&quot; about half way through the movie.
Many areas of this film will be copied for years to come, because
there were excellent aspects to the style, however so many things were
done
wrong that it will &quot;rank&quot; as only average overall in book!  See it, but it
is no masterpiece!
