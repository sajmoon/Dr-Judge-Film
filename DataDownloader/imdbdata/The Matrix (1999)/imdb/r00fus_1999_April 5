1999_April 5 

Probably not... But I am seriously considering the match-up. Phantom
Menace
has got a lot to live up to, and *I* would be pleasantly surprised if it's
as visually appealing as The Matrix.<br /><br />This movie is so graphically stunning, I would be shocked if it didn't get
some kind of award. I put my word on the line and asked some coworkers to
join me &amp; my friends to watch this opening night, and everyone totally
loved
it = big brownie points4me.<br /><br />Definitely go see this in a packed audience, you'll feel like cheering and
clapping the whole way through.<br /><br />My rating = 9/10
