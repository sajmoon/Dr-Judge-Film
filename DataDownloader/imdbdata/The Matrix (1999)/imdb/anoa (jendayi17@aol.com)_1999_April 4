1999_April 4 

The Matrix is one of the greatest action suspense sci-fi thrillers I have
ever seen.  The storyline is imaginative and invigorating.  I spent 150
minutes on the edge of my seat, eagerly awaiting more.  I can't wait to see
it again!  It was like wow.  The graphics, and computer imagery were awesome!
I can't wait to see what else cinema will have to offer us in
1999.
