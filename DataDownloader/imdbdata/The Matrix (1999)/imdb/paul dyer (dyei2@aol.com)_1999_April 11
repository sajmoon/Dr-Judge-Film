1999_April 11 

Ever wondered about your life? Wondered why you're here. Wondered what your
purpose was... wondered, what's the point? &quot;The Matrix&quot; sums it up in a
nutshell, a two and a half hour nutshell. Every possible question you could
ask derived from the movie is answered. The basis of the movie is
interesting, but it is how they pulled it off is what makes it INTENSE. A
suspenseful sci-fi for the open-minded. The ideas generated are as intense
and as cutting edge as the graphics. Not many films capture you beyond
special effects, but &quot;Matrix&quot; does and beyond. It's the graphics that hit
home the ideas. If this were attempted in earlier years the intensity
generated would have been minimalized. A fantastic performance by every
actor makes this a very believable and breathtaking window to a different
perspective of the world. It leaves you with an aftertaste of hope. You too
can defeat the system, but you can't think it... you have to &quot;know&quot;
it.<br /><br />
