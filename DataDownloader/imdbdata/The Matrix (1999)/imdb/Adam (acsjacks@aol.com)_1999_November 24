1999_November 24 

This is one heck of a movie. Sure, Keanu Reeves has little if no acting
skills, and quite a few parts of the movie run slowly...This movie is
still
a landmark to movie making skills by the brotherly directors. Packed with
philosophy, action, mystery,and break through special effects this movie
can
not hold itself back. The sequels should be really interesting, and I
think
it would be great if the movie would explain more about the theory of the
matrix more (but keep up the action, boys!). Overall, you are in for a fun
treat packed with all of the above.
Oh and a little note to whoever will cast the sequels: The new female
action
star of the matrix...who else but Buffy! The words Sarah Michelle Gellar
and
tight action suit go soooo smoothly together! If you catch my
drift!
