1999_May 3 

This movie suprised me.  I was shocked to really fall in love with this
movie.  This has become my favorite sci-fi film of current time.  I just
really got attached to the film.  I thought the character interaction was
really great.  This was the first film I have ever saw at the theater more
than once.  I understand that Keenu Reeves is not the best actor but he
was
pretty good in the film.  They maybe could have picked someone better but
I
really think he fit in just right.  I really liked Lawrence as Morpheus.
I
have never heard of him until this film.  He was great with his acting.
He
is one who mostly carried the film.  Carrie as Trinity was also very
impressive.  She did a wonderful job.  This movie not only had great
special
effects but a wonderful plot.  It was a good idea it makes you think that
this could really happen.  I have seen Bound another Wachowski brother's
film and loved it too.  These directors are beginning to be some of my all
time favorites.  I am very anxious for a sequel but hope they will not
screw
it up as other sequels ruin the franchise like Batman &amp; Robin.
