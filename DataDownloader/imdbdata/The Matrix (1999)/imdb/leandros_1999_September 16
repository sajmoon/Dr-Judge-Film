1999_September 16 

Yes, one has to admit, The Matrix is maybe &quot;the&quot; representative of the
new-millenial hype-action movie. It is a well acted, well directed, well
&quot;designed&quot;, and obviously well thought movie. There should be no doubt that
the action movies of the 2000s will more or less look like, feel like, sound
like and be flashy like The Matrix, IF the producers have enough money as
the Wachowsky brothers. <br /><br />So what's disappointing? Everyone left the theater feeling dizzy and
confused, having conversations over their personal pseudo-lives and the
ambivalence and vagueness of their perceptions of reality. Keanu Reeves as
Neo and Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus dazzled the audience with their
superb acting. Carrie-Anne Moss became every guy's dream date (watch the
Jiu-Jitsu moves!). But.... but The Matrix is so close to being just the
pumped-up, pretentious, expensive, star packed candidate of the &quot;Kafkaesque
Action Movie of the New Millenium&quot;, thanks to Dark City. It was so
frustrating not hearing anyone mention this romantic prototype of the
parallel world/deceived citizens plot. And, oh! That absolutely clich&eacute;, and
almost stupid ending with that mindless and laughable monologue! Now that
would be more suitable with a 70s low-budget space adventure.<br /><br />Yes, one must confess that The Matrix is truly and certainly good. It is
indeed mind and eye boggling. But, it is not *the* movie after all. For a
refreshing retrospective, Dark City by Alex Proyas and Bound by the
Wachowsky brothers is strongly recommended.
