The Matrix. Just hearing the name tingles my sences. If you have not seen
this movie, read my review. The cast was amazing, especially Morpheous
(bravo on the acting). The special effects were eye popping. The music was
fantastic, but most of all, the story swallowed me whole. After you see the
movie, wait an hour, and watch it again. Trust me, the first time you saw
it, you missed half. This was not just a cool action film with lots of
effects, it had an amazing story to tell. Think about the story, then think
about your life. I thought this movie was fantastic, go to see it. If you
don't like it, your all alone.<br /><br />foilerne
