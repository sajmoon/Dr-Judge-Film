1999_April 20 

This film will certainly get recognition by word of mouth, just as Scream
did. It's one of the most bizarre and well-written sci-fi stories I had ever
seen. It has a terminator-esque feel to it, with the idea that machines take
of the world. But instead of wiping out the human race, they enslave
them.... Brilliant! Add to this a wonderful cast, great special effects, and
the possibility of a sequel. Go see it....Twice.<br /><br />10 out of 10
