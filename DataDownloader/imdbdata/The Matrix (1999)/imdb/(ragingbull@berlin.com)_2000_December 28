People who enjoy this film and consider it the ultimate in science fiction
films haven't (A.) seen enough good films to judge or (B.) really have no
interest in a well written screenplay or characters that have depth and
emotion. The Matrix is like Independence Day all over again, extravagant
special effects but no character development or half way decent writing. I
cringed when I heard some of the cliches used throughout the film. And did
nobody notice that most of the main characters introduced played no real
role in the plot? This movie needed only four people, Neo, Trinity, the
agent, and Laurence Fishburne. The other characters were added for either no
reason or just terrible comic relief. Won four Oscars (swept every nominated
category) for Visual Effects, Sound, Sound effects editing and Editing. A
sadly overrated film.
