To me it's rare that a movie that made so much money and had so much hype is
really deserving of it but the Matrix deserved all the hype it received and
I'm sure the sequels which be nothing less then amazing. This movie probably
has the greatest graphics ever, so far at least. The acting is good, the
story is kinda stupid since they just babble about what the Matrix is and
part of it is kinda slow but the action more than makes up for it, you don't
really need a story when the action and graphics are as good as they were in
this movie. 9/10
