1999_August 30 

10 out of 10. I've seen it four times. I'm buying it on DVD. Amazing. I
loved it. As a hard SF reader, I'll admit that the story is neither truly
original or mindblasting, but it hardly matters. It does make you think. A
little. But most of all - it's pure visual pleasure. Keanu Reeves looks
GREAT. In that wonderful black outfit of his, mmm, drooling garanteed. The
fact that he doesn't make the most convincing hacker ever doesn't matter
much AT ALL. And the special effects - wow. Trinity flying through the air,
looking very, very cool. And the kungfu. Okay, Keanu does some stuff that
would have sent you rolling on the floor if he didn't look so good, but on
the whole, I thought the martial arts were great. And there's guns. Really
cool people firing really big guns. Cool music, too. Go see it. Maybe not
four times (like me!) but at least once.
