1999_September 6 

This film is fifteen times better Phantom Menace. The story line is very
interesting and invigorating. This film is not for everybody as one would
not suspect. The Matrix is stands alone far as science fiction in the
90's.
What other science fiction movie in the 90's is worthy of what you paid
for
it.
