This movie is the quintessential film for expressing the plight of
teenagers
and their identity crises.  This movie would be nothing if it did not so
expertly express the emotions and situation of millions of teenagers.  Of
course, it's kick-ass special effects and awesome acting by Lawerence
Fishburne was spectacular too.  Thanks to the Wachowski Brothers for an
awesome two hours.
