Well done, superb, and like what one other member said it does get better
every time you see it. The cinematography is something else and the set and
costume design literally blows my mind. What else blows my mind in this
movie is Laurence Fishburne. Just by watching I get this sense that he gave
the filmmakers everything they wanted for that character through his
performance. The revelation scene between Neo and Morpheus in the hotel to
me seems like it is too perfect, like it jumped out of the script and
storyboards because what was created visually worked so well. The set-design
and costumes are very expressionist themselves, and aid in the atmospheric
storytelling. The story, design, and style of the film are sure enough Best
Picture quality but the one flaw the film does have is that it at times is
way too much of an action film filled with a lot of cliches of the genre.
Though the action and special effects scenes are brilliant, I feel the movie
would be a singularly spectacular artistic achievement if it were toned down
and made for less money and relied solely on it's strong story and exciting
visual style.
