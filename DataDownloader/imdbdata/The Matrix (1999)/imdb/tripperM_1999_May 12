1999_May 12 

There has been so much religious comparisons on the Matrix pages that I
have
seen, it's astounding. beyond that... the Matrix is a film that you can
view
repeatedly and still find new things, new inside comments, nods, and
jokes,
and new angles of Keanu Reeves to stare at. Beyond that still is the best
cyberfilm to come out of the 90's. In fact I would go so far as to say
that
it's the best cyberfilm since Bladerunner. (which is a pre-mainstream
cyber
awareness film to begin with) and even though I like it, I can't with good
conscience include J.Mnemonic as a good cyberfilm. The f/x, story line,
and
cinematography is fluid and beautiful. Laurence Fishburne is as always
subtle and larger that life as Morpheus. Carrie-Anne Moss' Trinity kicks
almost as much butt as Milla Jovovich's Leeloo but with the grace of a
crane. Joe Pantoliano is wonderfully understated as our friendly, greasy
Judas, Cypher. Watch it...and dream...<br /><br />
