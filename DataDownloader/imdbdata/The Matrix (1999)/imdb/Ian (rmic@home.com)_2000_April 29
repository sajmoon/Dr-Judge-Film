Before I talk about how much i loved this film, i would enjoy pointing
out the fact that the directors/writers of this film know how to attract
to
males.  Their previous film, Bound, was a story about lesbians, and the
matrix, was a story that anyone can enjoy.
The matrix features tons of innovative methods of special effects and
camera work that i have never seen before, but on top of that, it proves,
under the right environment, much criticized actor keanu reeves can shine.
Him and his co stars do a phenomenal job in this film, the directing of
this
film is very innovative, as with the writing.
The film also incorporates one of the most original storylines to
date,
dealing with how people need to question their own existance, and question
reality.  A groundbreaking moment in sci-fi movies that has only been made
by a few movies such as Alien, or The terminator.  The Matrix contains
some
of the most packed and cool actions scenes also, although heavy on the
violence it is done relatively tastefully, limiting the gore content and
such.  A highly advised film for anyone of any age to at least give a
try.
