2001_July 14 

As much as one would like to denote this films intellegence, one has to
look
at the actions and the meanings behind them. Rather than just laughing out
loud at its action sequences. At times yes the action did seem uneeded and
un-called for, and at first I could have done without them, basically
because the story lines meaning was enough that caught my attention. But
whether or not you wanted to believe it, this film contained enormous
amounts of philosophy. These days it's hard to see a new movie that can
incorporate action and philosophy in one film. The only film to incorporate
philosophy (that's worth attention) would have to be Stanley Kubrick's
&quot;2001: A Space Odessey&quot;. Never once did I question 2001's integrity without
philosophy involved, and neither did I with The Matrix. Sure The Matrix
could have had some cheesy lines like, &quot;It's our way, or the
highway.&quot;...but
hey it's the real world and not everyone can come up with new original
lines
every second. I did question though something that bothered me. For one,
even though we are in something called &quot;The Matrix&quot; and have the ability to
perform any task we wish, as long as our &quot;will power&quot; and mind can achieve
such a state, how come is it that Neo and Morpheus and all of them are the
only ones who can perform such feats? I thought about this for a while and
than realized that they were the only ones in this world who had the
knowledge, which really makes me question our own reality. That maybe there
is something else out there, waiting for the person to gain the knowledge.
A
lot of human beings now have the &quot;will power&quot; and the right state of mind,
all they need is the knowledge of whatever it is out there, and than they
can perform whatever task is it that they can do. I guess that this movie
reminded me a lot of something called &quot;Astral Projection&quot; where as
unlimited
realms of existence giving you the ability to fly, jump dimensions, use
abilities that are unfathomable to man. Which is something that hit me when
I saw Neo flying in the end. That only made me question and give me the
anxiety to wait for the next one. My point is, basically, that if any movie
can make you question everything or anything as a whole, than that film was
indeed philosophical. This film definately ranks up there with 2001: A
Space
Odessey, and many other films like it.<br /><br />If I am the only one that not only looks for great cinematography, acting,
etc...and philosophy as well within a film...I feel bad cause it needs to
be
known to people. Philosophy was actually the first kind of theator in a
way.
Socrates and others would perform acts that would in turn demonstrate
philosophical meanings.
