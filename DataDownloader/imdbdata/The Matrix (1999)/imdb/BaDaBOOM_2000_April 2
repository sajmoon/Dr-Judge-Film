Very very very nice special effect.
It's the best I've seen.
The sound editing was also great.  It's amazing they put it all together,
espeically the lobby shoot out scene.  Just try to imagine them trying to
reproduce sound for that sequence.  It's amazing how it came
out.
The theme color was gloomy, black and somewhat blue and white.  It's almost
like that movie Payback with Mel Gibson.  The result came out great as
well.
