1999_April 29 

I went to see this primarily because my students (I teach Mathematics and
Computer Science at a University) were raving about it.  Some have even
seen
it as many times as I saw Good Will Hunting in theaters.  So I was
expecting
good.  I got one of the best films I've seen all year (o.k. it wasn't the
best year but); I like Sci Fi that makes you think!<br /><br />I've read comments from people who complain that they didn't know what was
going on for at least the first 15 minutes of the movie! (And you can tell
they think that's a bad thing?) I think it's nice to go see a movie,
especially an action movie, where you can't outline the entire thing after
seeing the trailer!  If you are told what's going on, what are you going
to
think about?  I found the beginning of the movie intriguing.  I didn't
know
for at least the first 15 minutes whether I would like the movie or not,
but
that's good, too.<br /><br />The look and feel of the movie was good and unique.  I don't know
whether
Keanu Reeves can act but he certainly fit this part perfectly, he was
exactly what you'd expect a computer hacker who got pulled out of his
reality to be like.  Frankly, I think he's been well cast in a number of
movies, but that's off the topic.  Lawrence Fishbourne was fabulous and
the
other characters seemed to fit.  I have seen this twice and I definitely
recommend seeing it in a big theater with a good sound system as it makes
use of all the latest technology.  I saw it in a smaller theatre the first
time.  In any event, I didn't find it lost too much the second time
'round.
In fact, unless we start getting something good opening soon, I'll
probably
see it a third time.<br /><br />I don't mind a few gaps you have to fill in yourself, like I said, I like
films that make you think; and trying to figure out the gaps is thinking.
This movie isn't for everyone (obviously from the comments).  It is a bit
dark and has some of that music video glitz to it that I usually don't
like.
And there is quite a bit of violence - although it's not the sadistic
kind
of violence that I can't sit through.  But it does get people talking.
The
only frustrating thing is that those of us who had seen it couldn't
discuss
it in class for fear of ruining the experience for those who hadn't.<br /><br />If you miss it in theaters I'd still catch it on video, but don't miss it
in
theaters, it's a great big-screen movie!
