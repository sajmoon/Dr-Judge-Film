What is The Matrix?
This is the main question for the character Neo in this
movie.
Well, the matrix is a movie full of special-effects, a great story-line,
very much action and good acting.
After thirty minutes of watching this movie you'll probably won't
understand
anything of it but that is what makes it a great movie, you actually have
to
pay attention and think about the movie.
The plot is pretty good for a SF-Action movie and the actors are doing a
great job (especially Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving)
But the most spectacular thing about this movie are the special effects,
truly great. People walk on walls, jump great distances and dodge bullets
(!) The art-direction is also great and the weapon-shots are very well
taken.
As a conclusion, my sister, the greatest SF-Action hater in the world
actually liked this film a lot (she didn't admit this to me, but to my
parents)
