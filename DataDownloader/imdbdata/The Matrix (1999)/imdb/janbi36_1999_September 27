1999_September 27 

This is a film that is visually stunning and has a reasonably good plot.
This is enough to please most of us who hunger for good sci-fi movies, of
which there are - alas - too few.  However, I agree that it doesn't
measure
up to the standard of Alien, Aliens, Terminator and others
mentioned.<br /><br />The buildup of Neo as &quot;The One&quot; is unconvincing, the schmalzy &quot;love
conquers
all&quot; solution to Neo's death is silly and remarkably lacking in
background,
and in general there just wasn't enough time - between the dazzling
special
effects - to develop the characters or story line.  I liked it, I'd
recommend it, but I think the film's visual impact has many viewers
blinded.
