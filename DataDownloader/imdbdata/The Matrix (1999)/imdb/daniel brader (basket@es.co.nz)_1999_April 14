How do you make the big bucks at the box office? see The Matrix and you'll
find out.
The Matrix is the latest blockbuster sci-fi actioneer directed by the
promising
Wachowski brothers who scored big with 1996's highly suspenseful,well made
and
original film Bound. But with The Matrix it seems the writer director team
of the
Wachowski brothers have sold out as here is a film with all the drawcards
of
your
typical blockbusters e.g. a big name star,state of the art special effects
and enough
audience manipulation to make James Cameron proud.<br /><br />From the outset
this film draws obvious
comparisons to Alex Proyas's Dark City as both films offer similar
premises
and both
films have dark and scary looking worlds.<br /><br />This film is all just a clever excuse for the
film makers to
make the most of their whopping budget by use of high tech whizz bangery
and
revolutionary special effects. The reason I say this as after this &quot;fake
world&quot; plot is
established the film forgets concentrating on a complex story and instead
sticks
closely to action movie clich&eacute;s including an ending suitable for an
Arnold
Schwarzenegger movie, not that I have any dislike for his films but when
you
have
started such a promising story as The Matrix did it seems a disappointment
to fall
back on tired old formula straight from the pages of an action movie
script.<br /><br />The Matrix however
cannot be denied its ability to
entertain and dazzle as with its action scenes and remarkable special
effects as these
are first rate. The action scenes are all super charged and fun but one
must
feel that
though the action is good it is inappropriate and though the special
effects
are good
they are not used for strictly storytelling moments. For top use of
special
effects for
storytelling check out Dark City.<br /><br />Another criticism I
have of this film are its
incredibly bland and lifeless performances. The star Keanu Reeves goes
from
hammy
to just plain dull and his supporting cast also struggle to overcome the
silliness of the
production as flat and unappealing performances are dished up by
everyone.<br /><br />But in all, The
Matrix, though an extremely flawed
film, is perfect for undemanding and unseasoned movie goers as this fast
paced
mindless tripe with it's clich&eacute; riddled plot will light up the box offices
as there is jaw
dropping action and great special effects and at the end of the day that's
what your
average Joe Bloggs pays to see.<br /><br />2.5/5<br /><br />
