1999_May 13 

Apart from the last 15 minutes, Matrix is one of the best picture of the
year; it mixes great action sequences and cool dialogues with original and
not obvious considerations about our world and the dangers in it. Although
there are
some unanswered questions it moves quite well in the world of virtual
reality where many films such as &quot;The lawn mower&quot; got lost before. What I
can' t understand is the ending in a
horrible &quot;soap opera-scene&quot; and, in the last sequence.
And in contrast with the meaning of the rest of the movie, the audience is
satisfied like common people of the movie. &quot;Don't worry&quot; we are told &quot;you
don't have to fight to get your freedom! A hero is doing it for
you&quot;.
