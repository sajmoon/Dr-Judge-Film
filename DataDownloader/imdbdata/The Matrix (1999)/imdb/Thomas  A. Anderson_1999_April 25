1999_April 25 

The Matrix is one of the BEST science fiction movies ever made. The acting
at times is just...acceptable and the story/plot has many elements that
have
been borrowed from other films, but, the Matrix executes the ideas in a
far
superior fashion.
This movie is eye candy at its best. Every special effect will make your
jaw hit the floor. The costumes are extremely stylish--I especially like
the
fact that the character &quot;Switch&quot; wears an all-white leather ensemble as
opposed to the all-black outfits all the other characters wear. She stands
out.
Even Keanu Reeves couldn't sink this one. The action sequences are
un-surpassed...the kung-fu is only out-done by perhaps some of Jackie Chan
or Jet Li's work...
There are some plot holes. But, the movie makes a great deal more sense
the
second or more times through, but you'll want to see it again for the
visual
effects.
I love this movie. 10/10. Although I admit nothing is perfect, the sheer
awe-inspiring effects have influenced my vote.
