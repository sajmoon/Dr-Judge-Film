1999_May 10 

I loved this movie. The key gripe I have heard from others that also liked
it, is that the story was hard to follow. This is a movie that requires
your
complete attention. You cannot miss a word of dialogue, or a bit of
visuals.
See this movie without distractions, let it absorb you, and you will
understand it, and enjoy it. If you feel like you might be part of the
Matrix at the end, you succeeded.
