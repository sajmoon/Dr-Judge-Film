1999_April 5 

Matrix was a very entertaining idea for a story, unfortunately it turned
into a typical &quot;bust-'em-up&quot; action film.  Without the long battle
sequences, Matrix could have been a very provocative cinema experience.
The
story was well through out, except for a few errors, resulting in some
sections of the film being unrealistic and unbelievable.<br /><br />The idea of the Matrix was one that got me thinking through out the film,
as
well as several hours after the film of the possibility of it's existence.
In today's film industry, many films are just distorted versions of other
films. The story of the Matrix does not follow suit. On the other hand,
this
is only true for the story.  Of course the action sequences are very
difficult to be original, but several other visual elements were familiar,
because they have be used before.<br /><br />Many scenes in the film made me comment to myself in a sarcastic tone,
&quot;Yeah
right.&quot;<br /><br />On the upside, I hope that someday I myself can walk though the metal
detector with many fully automatic weapons strapped to me, if not only to
see the expression on the officer's face.<br /><br />
