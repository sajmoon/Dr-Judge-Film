I am sorry, but I trully don't know why everyone loved this movie so much.
The idea that this word is only fiction, is thousands of years old, but
instead of, let's use Hindu's word Maya (ilusion), they must use what they
used in Terminator, robots. The casting itself is good, although Keanu is
not really one of my favourite actors. The movie has excellent action
scenes, and is trying to be &quot;deep&quot;, but when one does have some knowledge of
certain religions and their views in this world, it just sounds cheap. The
idea of a saviour I don't like much. But hey, we are all so different and
have so many views on so many things, that I can not say it is a bad movie.
It is not. It just isn't so original as people say it is.
