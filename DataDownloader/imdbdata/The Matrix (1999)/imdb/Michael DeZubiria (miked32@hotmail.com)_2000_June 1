Finally a science fiction film that cannot be immediately dismissed as
either unreal or impossible. How can anyone say that this isn't exactly the
way that reality is? To try and disprove this view of reality would be like
trying to disprove the existence of God. Maybe he's there, maybe he isn't,
but no one can possibly prove it either way. It works the same way for The
Matrix. It is possible that everything that we see is fed into our minds by
machines and that we would never know it. <br /><br />Probably the only remotely convincing argument the other way would be that
if that were true, why would the machines give us a movie like this to
watch? It would expose them! But then again, maybe they just want to get us
thinking, maybe to see how we'll react to the possibility of their
existence. Maybe they are getting ready to present themselves to us. Robot
rapture! Who can say that the Wachowski brothers are not messengers?<br /><br />This is by far the best science fiction film that I have ever seen. Aside
from the relatively plausible story, every other element of the film was
spectacular! The special effects (which, in my opinion, usually take more
away from a film than they add) were awesome, the fight scenes were
incredibly intense, and the pace of the film itself was breathtaking. Every
hole is covered up brilliantly, even down to a definition of deja-vu and a
possible reason for why so many different foods taste like chicken. These
little ties to reality are one of the best ways that this film was able to
come off so realistically. <br /><br />The Matrix is absolutely not to be missed. Even people who don't like
science fiction or even action films will more than likely enjoy this film.
It is well presented, it is not unnecessarily excessive, and it presents the
most innovative camera work in years. It has something for everyone, and
will become a science fiction classic without a doubt.
