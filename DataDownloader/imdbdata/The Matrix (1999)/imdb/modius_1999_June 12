The Matrix is fundamentally about a messiah called 'the one' (Keanu
Reeves)
who is a hacker who discovers that everyone hooked up to a computer
simulation (altough why I have no idea) and is brought to the real world
by
Morpheous (played by a very bored Laurence Fishburne) and his crack team
of
hackers/terrorists.<br /><br />The plot has been overworked to an outer limits style, and it takes ages
for
the action and the film to actually kick in.<br /><br />The film in itself is boring and slow, the actors don't seem committed to
their characters, they all seem bored, and inconsequential to the film,
what
mattered was the plot, the hong kong styled filming and the visually
stunning special effects.<br /><br />The special effects appear to be very good, however the overuse of
computer
graphics on action setpieces (such as the helicopter sequence) leaves you
feeling that you've been ripped off.  I want to see real stunts,
explosions
- not computer cgi-crap - sure it looks good, but if you want to make an
action sequence at least make it believable.<br /><br />The way the film has been shot is likened to John Woo, with slowed down
shooting sequences - graphically showing how the bullets fly off.
Although
this is beautifully shot, it does leave you wondering if you actually WANT
to see a couple of people walking around in trenchcoats blowing people
away
(hang on, haven't I heard this somewhere before???).<br /><br />Apart from the overuse of CGI, I liked the combination this film used of
martial arts and Hong Kong styled directoring, but the martial arts did
feel
as good as it should have been.  It leads me to ask if they wanted a good
martial artist, why did they use the very stiff actor Keanu Reeves?  Why
not
Chow Yun Fat or even Jet Li - at least they look good when they do martial
arts, Reeves just looks out of place doing all the complex martial
arts.<br /><br />I hated the bad guys, they were deliberatly made with no remorse, no minds
and no acting.  They were boring, montonious, laborious pieces of
cardboard.
Whenever they were on screen I felt like going to sleep - there was no
real
credible bad guy or a big name playing the bad guy - this let the film
down
(mind you so does the gratious overuse of cgi and gunfighting), the
half-hearted ending of Keanu blocking every move that the bad guy did was
too quick for me - it should have been one long fight sequence.<br /><br />At the end of the film, Reeves tells us he didn't want to tell us how this
film ends - that's up to us - no it isn't, its up to the directors and
producers who made this film and are planning the sequels.<br /><br />If a sequel is planned - more effort needs to be made on credible action
sequences, credible bad guys and credible acting.<br /><br />Overall, the film is stunning to watch and if you ignore the complex plot
you can enjoy a dark, cool attempt at a Hollywood made Hong Kong film with
a
lot of CGI.  I'd personally give this film a 7 but I felt so annoyed at
the
bad guys and the less then realistic action sequences I'll give it a 6
instead.
