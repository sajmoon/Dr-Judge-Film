1999_September 23 

When I initially saw this film I new nothing about the plot, let alone the
matrix. I was asking myself the same questions as Neo was, &quot;What is the
matrix&quot;. This kept the film alive for me. Thats maybe why I gave it a 10 out
of 10. The film reminds me of
&quot;Dark Cities&quot;, where everything is not what it seems, It also relates to how
my brain works.
