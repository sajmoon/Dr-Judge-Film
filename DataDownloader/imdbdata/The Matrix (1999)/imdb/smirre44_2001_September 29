What makes this movie so good? Please tell me, I watched it once, and
thought it was fairly OK, I borrowed it on DVD from a friend, who thinks it
is the best movie of all time (which it is not) and tried to watch it again,
but found my thoughts drifting away the whole time. Yes, I know this movie
tries to convey a message, doesn't every movie, and the visual FX are fairly
impressive, but watching it repeatedly just doesn't seem to make it better.
My favourite movie of all time? I really can't say, there have been loads of
movies i like, Matrix just isn't one of them. Sorry...
