1999_April 5 

This is a well-rounded movie. It has ground breaking special effects that
do
not appear to be forced into the plot just because they are cool. It has
an
intelligent plot that has you thinking throughout the story. It has action
to rival all the formula Hollywood 'chase scenes.' It's a movie you'll
want
on DVD. Fast action, mental concepts, high tech. No gore. No nudity. How
did
this get through Hollywood. Way to go Warner.
