1999_July 12 

The first hour was pretty good. But then the next hour, it got a bit too
complicated and a bit boring. BUT, the last 45 minutes or something, was
great! There was one shooting scene, which was the most awesome scene I
have
ever seen. Those two minutes was almost worth the ticket
alone!
If you like action great special effects, you have to see this
movie.
