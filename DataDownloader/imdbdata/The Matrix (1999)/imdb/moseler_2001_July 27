The message behind this movie can be applied to a billion things in our
lives.  If you are religious, than all others walk around oblivious to the
&quot;truth.&quot;  The same applies to those who are:  militant, libertarian,
enlightened, highly intelligent, insane, practical, overly-sensitive,
down-to-earth, etc.....
I could watch this movie a million times over and feel educated each and
every time.   This is an important film.
