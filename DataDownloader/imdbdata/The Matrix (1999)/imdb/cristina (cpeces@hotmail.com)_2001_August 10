Matrix is one of the best pictures ever made. That's obvious, and people
who
say that is boring and stupid didn't understand the film.<br /><br />Is the most intelligent film I am ever seen, and it gives us another vision
of the fantastic films.<br /><br />This film is only for intelligent people, people who can enjoy one of those
films that makes you think when you go out of the cinema.<br /><br />I am sorry if you are one of those people who like films like Titanic,
Independence day or Armaggedon, but this film is not for you and if you
want
to see it or you have already seen it, you should sit, relax and see this
movie a thousand times, until you've understood it, because it may be
difficult, but you will enjoy this incredible movie.<br /><br />10/10
