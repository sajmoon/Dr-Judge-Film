The Matrix had everything, including the most beautiful
action i have ever seen in my life. One thing most people
dont catch about this movie, is that there is alot of christian
symbolism in this movie. of course neo is a jesus figure,
and im not going to bore you going into the details but the
movie was released on easter, think about that, and then
watch it again.
