1999_April 8 

I went in with little idea of what this movie was about.  I saw the
commercials like everyone else, hit the web page, and decided the movie
didn't matter, I just wanted to see the effects.  I thought &quot;the plot sounds
a little like Tron&quot; so I wasn't expecting too much of the story.  I remember
Keanu Reeves in Bill and Ted's Bogus Success (that is the name of that
movie, isn't it?) and I REALLY didn't expect much from the actors (I held
out a little hope because of Laurence Fishburne's presence).  I was thinking
too far back.  I should've thought about 2 years ago when I saw the Devil's
Advocate in which Keanu turned in a great performance, which he matched if
not improved upon in the Matrix.  Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss completed
the triumvirate quite effectively to show us a very well performed
movie.<br /><br />The movie is about these people who live in a simulated world - oh, but I've
said too much.  Go see it.  It's a sci-fi plot I've seen hinted at but never
fully formed in this fashion, which I find to be truly unique for this genre
of movie.<br /><br />All elements necessary to give a film a 10 were here...excellent acting,
writing, directing, and story-telling, great action scenes, and of course,
the sweetest eye-candy ever to hit the silver screen.  One of the only
movies I've ever watched and then been upset about an hour later because I
couldn't watch it again right away.  Definitely see this
one.<br /><br />PS  I can't wait for Phantom Menace to come out :)
