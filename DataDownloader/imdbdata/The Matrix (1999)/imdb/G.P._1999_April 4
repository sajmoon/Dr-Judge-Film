1999_April 4 

I loved this movie.  The special and visual effects were mind-numbing.  The
Wachowski Bros. paid (completely deserved) homage to the some of the best
directors and pictures made this decade.  Movie hits like The Truman Show,
Dark City, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Hard Boiled, Hard Target, and The
Crow.  Legendary directors like John Woo, James Cameron, Peter Weir, and
Alex Proyas.  This movie had it all.  Great effects, kick ass (and expertly
directed) martial arts fight scenes, exhilarating gun battles, an
unbelievable plot (carried out to perfection), and a paranoia-driven message
that the wool has been pulled over our eyes blinding us from the truth.
Every actor does the role to perfection.  The fight scenes could not get any
better.  I personally didn't want it to end.  The movie was well-done and
the Wachowski Bros. should be proud because this movie was the best sci-fi
action film I've seen since Terminator 2.  If you're looking for an awesome
effects and digitally stunning movie, see this movie as fast as you can.  It
doesn't disappoint.  But don't see it in a cheap theater.  See it where you
can really enjoy every quality and aspect it has to offer.  Two thumbs up!!
Way up!!!!!! Four stars out of four stars. 10 out of 10!  Don't miss
it!
