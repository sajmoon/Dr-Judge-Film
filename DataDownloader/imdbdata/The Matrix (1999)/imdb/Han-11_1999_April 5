1999_April 5 

This is one of the great movies I have seen. The special effects are state
of the art and some the best I have seen. The story line is a real teaser
and fun to see in action. It leaves a opening for another movie but this
won't be an easy shoe to fill. The actors fill their parts and it looks as if
they put a great deal of effort in to this movie. A must see for any science
fiction or action fan.<br /><br />
