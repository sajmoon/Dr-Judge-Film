1999_August 10 

My teenage daughter, my adult son and myself have all seen this brilliant
movie at least two times each  - I believe it appeals to all ages.  We
came
out of the cinema with an adrenaline rush and wanted to learn kung-fu!!
We
settled with buying dark glasses (sad?) but would also like long dark
coats.
We've named this syndrome as 'the matrix disorder' What I would really
like
is for all fans when they go to watch it again and matrix 2 &amp; 3 (they
better
make them with Keanu) to wear dark glasses and long dark coats (a la Rocky
Horror Show).  I can't believe friends who say they've not got the plot -
I
think they've lost the plot themselves!
