1999_June 24 

I'll not waste your time repeating the storyline but here are a few
pointers.<br /><br />Excellent film making.  At times gothic, a touch of Hitchcock here, a bit
of
Star Trek, B5, TRON, it's all there.  Even the basic concept and several
aspects of the overall theme are borrowed.  Acting is, in the main, good
although Reeves is weak but...........<br /><br />It doesn't matter !!!!!  Go with an open mind and see this film. Forget
about Star Wars its mindless, childish pap.
