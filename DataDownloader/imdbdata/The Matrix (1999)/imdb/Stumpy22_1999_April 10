1999_April 10 

I went into the movie with several preconceptions, but I was surprised.  I
was astonished both by the thought that was put into the plot, and the lack
of thought that was put into the theory.  The combination of the second
coming of Christ and Zen Buddhism was nifty, but one would have to leave
their logic in the car outside if they are going to follow the plot without
gasping for coherence.  I thought that Keanu did a fine job, acting the less
like Bill S. Preston Esq. than ever, but it was a bit telling when the
entire theater laughed at his attempt to look stylish while fighting; he
isn't a martial artist.<br /><br />The major holes in the plot may pass by some people, which may be a good
thing, but I think that in a movie which tries to present a possible future,
challenging the mind of the patron, it is sad when there are such problems
in the actual presentation.  There was a definite lack of continuity in
thought that left me feeling insulted, as if the producers thought that I
would not notice that nothing fit together.  I think that if the movie was
written and presented to a publisher, they would get rejected because of the
lack of thoroughness.<br /><br />But wow, there were a lot of scenes that just amazed me.  I was
captured.<br /><br />It has a good story line with poor world design, a great presentation, and
lots of eye candy.<br /><br />I kind of hope that people could look past the problems, but I also would be
saddened if people didn't see the big logical errors.  It would mean that
people don't think about and thus can't learn from movies.  If they don't
get the problems with the movie, they probably don't get the point of it
either. <br /><br />
