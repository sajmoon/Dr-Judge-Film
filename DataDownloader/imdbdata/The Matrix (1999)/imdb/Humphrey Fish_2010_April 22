I had heard about this movie I long time ago, but I didn&#x27;t want to see
it because I had heard that it was a little boring, but then I decided
to just watch it myself, and I did not think that it was boring at all,
I thought that this movie was a really great and enjoyable film! I
thought that this movie had great effects, especially the lobby
shooting scene! No let me rephrase that, I thought that this movie had
great everything, this is one hell of a movie that is one of the best I
have seen in a few years! This is a really great film all in all, it is
greatly acted, greatly directed and produced, and overall is just a
movie that is very nice to sit through and enjoy, I liked every single
second of this movie! I have said this about a lot of movies, but this
is another movie that really has had an impact on my life, it is not
the greatest movie ever made, but it is still one movie that is really
a great time and is worth watching for the joy of it! I wish that I had
seen this movie when I had first heard about it, because I would have
known about what a great movie it is a lot sooner instead of today! <br /><br />I also noticed that this movie one four really well deserved Academy
Awards for Best Film Editing, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Effects,
and Best Visual Effects, because this movie has got a lot of really
great visual effects in it, some that remind me of science fiction, not
the low budget stuff from the 1950&#x27;s, I am talking about the big
project stuff, like Star Wars, this movie has really got some of the
best visual effects that I have seen out of any movie!<br /><br />This is going to be a little obvious but, you probably should see this
movie as part of your movie education, because you are going to enjoy
this movie really much, you are going to think that it is one of the
greatest movies ever made probably, though I don&#x27;t think it is one of
the greatest movies ever made. <br /><br />10/10
