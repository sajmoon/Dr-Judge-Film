This is the most fantastic movie I have ever seen!!! I know what you are
thinking...&quot;Yeh, but it's just another typical sci-fi movie for computer
geeks and trekkies&quot;...Not quite. This movie has it all!!! Computers,
conspiracies, heroes, villains, Martial Arts, guns, robots, virtual reality,
romance, trenchcoats, cool sunglasses and did I mention trenchcoats??? Take
a breath before you start watching this one. I saw it four times at the
cinema and twice on video!!! It has every twist and turn you can think of,
and when your head isn't spinning from the plot, the special effects will
have you jumping out of your seat. Watch out for the awesome martial arts
choreography, too. If you haven't signed up for Tae-bo after this one, you
never will!!
