1999_April 20 

First of all...wow!  This movie just absolutely blew me away.
It has everything a good science fiction movie needs and more.
The fight scenes were great, especially when combined with
special effects that set a whole new standard for action movies
everywhere.  The way the Wachowski bros. wove together parts
from different movies, books--even the bible!--was terrific.
They really did an amazing job.  The acting was terrific.  Keanu
Reeves made up for all the crap he's done since Speed, and I
have forgiven Carrie-Anne Moss for Models, inc.  The directors
really sucked every last bit of talent they could from the cast
and crew.  Finally, the camera work was fantastic--slow motion
fight scenes usually drive me nuts, but in this case I
absolutely loved it.  And the way they would rotate the camera
angles...kind of like those annoying gap commercials only way
more cool. The dipping, rotating shot of Keanu dodging bullets
on the roof in slow motion was the best. Anyway, I definitely
recommend this movie for anyone.
