The Matrix belongs definitely to my top 10 of all movies. Technically it's
awesome, but effects do not take the main role. The story is completely
logical, there's no reason why it could not be real. There's nothing
disturbingly wrong, watching it is pure enjoyment. Every time I watch it I
find more interesting details about it. Brilliant piece of art! Can't wait
to see the other two episodes of the trilogy. 99 out of 100
points.
