This is the best sci-fi movie I have seen, and maybe also the best movie I
have ever seen.<br /><br />The script is just mind blowing and the acting performance is
superb.
In the lead role you will find Keanu Reeves in his best role ever,for
sure.This role is made for Keanu Reeves and nobody,and by that I mean
nobody,could play it as good as he did.
As you probably know,big movies like this get sequels and they are no
working on Matrix 2 and 3.And I must say that I cant wait for them to come.I
also know that Keanu Reeves is going to play the lead role in all of the,so
that is a relief.<br /><br />Don't miss out on the greatest movie of all time,the script is so original
and makes you think that it maybe could be true.(just wait and see,you will
know what I mean).<br /><br />10 out of 10 of course.
