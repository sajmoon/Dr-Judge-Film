1999_April 5 

I liked the Matrix, but disagree with everyone who's so nuts about the
action scenes.
Yes, there is slow-mo, but saying things like &quot;better than The Killer&quot; are
misleading at best.
John Woo's sense of editing and framing are far better than the
Wachowski's.  Their use of slow-mo slows things down, rather than giving the
action sequences an interesting cadence.  (I'm not referring to the &quot;time
slice&quot; effect, btw, but the slow-mo used during the gunfights.)
If you want to go back to what I believe is the best use of slow-mo, watch
the shootout at the end of the Wild Bunch. If you really watch Peckinpah's
artistry, you'll notice what the slow-mo is really for: to capture the
essence of men fighting desperately for their lives.  Watch as the Mexicans
appear in doorways, perfectly framed, and then taking a lethal dosage of
lead.  See a strategically perched soldier get picked off with a quick burst
of machine gun fire.  And feel a rhythm develop as these little acts of
violence are interspersed with quick shots of men firing, reloading, killing
and dying.
The Wachowski's use slow-mo to make their gunfights &quot;cool&quot; and to pay
homage to their cinematic idols.  And that's it.
What's more important than the action, is to create a surprisingly
interesting and engaging story, with likable characters.  And the
Wachowski's succeeded at that without question. <br /><br />
