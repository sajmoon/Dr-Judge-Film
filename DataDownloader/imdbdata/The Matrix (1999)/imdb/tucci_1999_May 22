1999_May 22 

Take a very big pot, add in 2 litres of new (I mean really new!!!) idea, a
couple of good actors, excellent camera - cook it  on very very good
storyline, add amazing SFX (they are amazing when You can't tell the
difference between real and not real - and by the way this is actually the
point of the movie /the difference not the SFX...) and when is just about
ready add a spicy alert message and You got a delicious soup I and You've
been waiting so so long...
The &quot;Agent Smith&quot; description of our &quot;human&quot; species is god damn
true!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Eat when is still hot - If You wait a second it's all gone...
