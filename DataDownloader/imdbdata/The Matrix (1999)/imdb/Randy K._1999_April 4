1999_April 4 

I had no real interest in this movie from the commercials, and 
I'm not a big Keanu Reeves fan (though I think his reputation is 
worse than he really is.). But when I found out that this was a
Wachowski Brothers film, and got a few hints abouts the plot, I 
figured I'd give it a try, since I really thought &quot;Bound&quot; was a 
well done film.<br /><br />I have no regrets. This was a very enjoyable movie. Reeves was 
actually quite believable in it, and Laurence Fishburne put in 
an excellent performance, which I have come to expect from him.<br /><br />It got slow a bit in the middle, but much of that exposition was 
needed to set the stage for the wild ride climax to the movie. 
In something that is becoming all too rare these days, I truly 
was not sure how the movie would end. That alone gives it bonus 
points.<br /><br />The special effects were great, in that they helped to tell the 
story, and not make the movie into a 2-hour &quot;gee, aren't we
clever film-makers&quot; wank-fest that seems to be all the rage in
action/sci-fi movies these days.<br /><br />The cinematography overall was very good, with interesting 
camera angles, though I'm not sure why movies of this nature 
always seem to be filmed in such low-light
