1999_April 11 

Lots of comments of Matrix compare to many of the best sci-fi films
around.
Can I now compare it to many of the martial arts films I have seen. Lots
of
Bruce Lee / Jet Li influences were present in the main &quot;training sequence&quot;
with tongue placed firmly in cheek. Taking into account that this is the
first full on fight film that I have seen K.R. do, he didn't do too bad
for
a beginner. The choreography was excellent and helped by surprisingly few
special effects. I have not enjoyed a film this much for a long time, but
I
think Star Wars Eps. 1 will superceed this - just.
