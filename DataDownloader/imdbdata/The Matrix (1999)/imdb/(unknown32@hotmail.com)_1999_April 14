1999_April 14 

The first thing I want to say is : I think this movie shouldn't be even
compared or quoted as &quot;good enough until Star Wars releases in May &quot;
because
it shouldn't. This movie is able to stand on its own as a &quot;techno science
fiction &quot;. Star Wars in general is a entity of its own and anything to be
compared against it would be unfair.<br /><br />This movie has a great script , great characters , one of
the
best jaw dropping effects I have seen. Keanu Reeves played a much better
role then in Johnny &quot;Moronic&quot; but then again the movie was bad in the
first
place. Laurence Fishburne had a outstanding role ,and he  shines in this
movie (let alone his sunglasses). But my only problem is with Carrie-Anne
Moss's role as Trinity. Her character was the best out of the group in the
beginning of the film , but after she became Reeves side kick her role
diminish over the course of the movie.
This movie begs for a sequel and really it has to : because I want to know
what &quot;Zion &quot; looks like.<br /><br />If you love this movie after one showing see it again,
and I just hope it will look great on DVD.<br /><br />
