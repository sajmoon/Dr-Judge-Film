1999_April 24 

I am sure lots of us were extremely excited after seeing the trailer during
the Superbowl to see this film.  And man, The Matrix does not let you down.
Insane kung fu battles, spectacular gun duels, and a very cool helicopter
explosion keeps you well entertained. If you like unreal action, this one is
for you.  Though this movie was a tad long, the fight sequences were
amazing, and it is worth seeing on the big screen.
