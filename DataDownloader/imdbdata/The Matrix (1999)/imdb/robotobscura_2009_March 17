I couldn&#39;t believe the people who voted poorly for this legendary, top
creative movie. I&#39;m dead sure they didn&#39;t understand the story behind
the world &amp; the principles of the Matrix. Go see this movie 5 times
more, then watch the Animatrix &amp; read the books, maybe you need a
manual to make it to your minds who knows....<br /><br />I agree that a quite similar idea was used in Alex Proyas&#39; Dark City.
But what if I tell you both Dark City, &amp; this so called Star Trek
Episode is a complete copy of another concept?<br /><br />Go see for yourself. Google these keywords down :<br /><br />&quot;ALLEGORY OF THE CAVE by Plato&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Thinking so ruthless for the ones who create or derive ideas &amp; improve
them to a point where they can shape it into a movie, &amp; not showing any
respect for creative minds&quot;.... <br /><br />it&#39;s a very easy thing to do. If I start to think so blame oriented,
then I come to a conclusion which is &quot;from this time ,no one should
make a movie. No horror movies! No vampires, no werewolves, no
creatures. No thrillers with killers. Why? because these were all used
200 centuries ago in books &amp; literature. Oh all movies are copycats
right!?!? Then I think we should kill ourselves, drink cyanide or
something. there is nothing else to do in this world.
