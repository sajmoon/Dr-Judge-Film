If you haven't seen this movie then you are missing a lot!! When I saw
this
movie the words that popped out of my mouth after the movie was &quot;WoW....&quot;
When you think about the Matrix you think it will just be another science
fiction movie with cool effects and thats all. But boy are you wrong! Sure
this movie does have great special effects. It also has a great
plotline.
It really makes you think about the world. If that really is going to
happen in the future or not. The movie is about a man named Neo who is
brilliantly played by Keanu Reeves, who is trying to figure out what is
The
Matrix. The movie's big question is to either take the blue pill or the
red
pill. You'll find more about that if you watch the movie. All I have to
say
is that it definately leaves you thinking.
