1999_April 22 

I know this comment I make will get lost in the already 200+ entries already
made (I blame myself for not posting opening day I saw it) but this really
marks a period in film history.<br /><br />Bound, one of my favorite movies ever, as you already know was the Wachowski
brother's first pic. The Matrix has the same style and wit, but more plot
holes and the curse of hollywood (occasional dumb dialog and scenes that
seem forced). But for what it was worth, the fx were great and the
performances where excellent. A MUST SEE, especially for sci-fi lovers
waiting for the release of The Phantom Menace.
