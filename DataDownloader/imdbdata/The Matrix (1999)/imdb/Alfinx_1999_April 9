1999_April 9 

If you see only one movie this year, see &quot;Phantom Menace&quot;. If you see two
movies this year, see &quot;The Matrix&quot;. <br /><br />It really was way above my initial expectations. 
Intelligent, captivating, intriguing, mysterious...
the way sci-fi should be.<br /><br />The special effects were cool, but they pale in comparison
to the brilliant plot and script. <br /><br />My only minor complaint... fighting scenes looked too fake.
None
of them seem to put much force into their punches &amp; kicks.<br /><br />I'll give this one a 9.
