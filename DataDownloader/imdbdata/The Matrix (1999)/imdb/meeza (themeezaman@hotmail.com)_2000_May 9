What is The Matrix? How could this computer generated machine rule our mind?
How could this happen? The answers to these who-cares type questions are in
the modern sci-fi thriller &quot;The Matrix.&quot; Do you know what The Matrix really
is? It is a very boring science fiction film about a man's battle in a
computer generated world. It is also a movie with some very bad acting that
all stars with the king of bad acting- Keanu Reeves. Whoa! I forgot
something else. It is also 7 dollars drown the drain if you check this one
out in the theatre. I do have to admit that the special effects were
spectacular. They are worth the price of admission ( maybe half-price) .
Even though I loved the effects, I am going to have log off to &quot;The
Matrix.&quot;
