i though that it was a brilliant movie by the wachowski brothers. it
permeated good acting, visual and sound effects and it was truly
intriguing.
it set a standard for all scifi movies of the action kind. it probably
set
a trend.  the acting and shots were really great, i've never thoroughly
been
left speechless by an action movie before but this one was something worth
watching.  i've never enjoyed scifi movies but the matrix was
astounding.
