This has to be the slowest, talkiest &quot;action&quot; movie ever made. The premise
is reconstituted &quot;Terminator&quot; without the humor or intelligence. It is
nothing but eye-candy without an interesting or original thought in it.
&quot;Gee! Maybe like... we're all asleep or somethin' and this is all a dream
man!&quot; Walk your dog, read a book, do some homework, do anything, but do
NOT
waste your money and time on this stupid, BORING, snooze of a
movie.
