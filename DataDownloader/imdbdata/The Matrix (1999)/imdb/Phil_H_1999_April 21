1999_April 21 

Before I begin, let me say this: I am not a fan of Keanu Reeves' acting
ability.  Short of &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&quot; movies, he hasn't found a niche yet (in my
opinion).  I went to see this film on the advice of several people whose
opinions are valuable to me.  What I found was that Keanu's normal
stupidity
actually was believable here!  This film (for Keanu) works!
Really.<br /><br />I was impressed with all the acting, the effects, and even with Keanu.
This
IS his best film to date.<br /><br />Is this film as good as the rating makes it sound? No.  I reserve an &quot;8&quot;
rating for films like &quot;The Empire Strikes Back,&quot; but this films isn't as
bad
as a &quot;6&quot;...by default I give it a &quot;7.&quot;  Could be a bit better, and could
have been a LOT worse!<br /><br />See this film if:<br /><br />(1) you're a big Keanu fan.
(2) you are a computer savy (IT professional) person
(3) you like fire-fight scenes.<br /><br />
