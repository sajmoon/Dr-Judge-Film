A very enjoyable feast for the eyes, and to a lesser extent, the old grey
matter...<br /><br />Reeves is as strong as he'll ever be in a role, but is supported very well
by everyone else, including Fishburne and Weaving.<br /><br />The effects are stunning, all nicely wrapped up in a good
story.<br /><br />Could have been better, but could have been a lot worse!
