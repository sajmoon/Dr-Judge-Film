1999_April 10 

Awesome sci fi/action movie.  Keanu Reeves isn't that great at acting but
he's great in the action scenes.  The story is great even though part of it
is from the Terminator movies and it takes up a lot of the movie.  The
action scenes are awesome.  I hope they make a sequel.  The best movie of 99
so far until Star Wars Episode 1 comes out.  Go see this on the big screen
and get it on DVD.
