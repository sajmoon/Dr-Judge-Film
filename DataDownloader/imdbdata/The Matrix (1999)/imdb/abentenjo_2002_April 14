Borrowing many of its ideas from Hong Kong movies yet subverting them to
create an experience like no other, this often spoofed and pretentiously
scripted affair is nevertheless an action movie classic; a breath-taking
masterpiece that firmly established the end of the nineties with one solid
roundhouse kick. Its pumped-up and highly-charged action sequences blend a
dazzling array of firepower with kung fu, expertly handled by the genius
of
Yuen Woo Ping, who's digitally-enhanced fight scenes intertwine with a
hyper-stylised narrative that moves at a breakneck pace, designed solely
for
the short attention span of the MTV generation. The story takes us into
the
bleak apocalyptic future where the machines rule the earth, and what we
believe to be the `real world' is merely a computer program designed to
shield us from the horrid truth. Neo (Reeves) is said to be the 'chosen
one'
who can save the human race from its inevitable annihilation, but with a
few
Agents, traitors and lovers along the way, it's not going to be an easy
quest. The Wachowski's state-of-the-art cinematic vision has very few
flaws
- although hardened martial arts fans may find the Keanu `I know kung fu'
Reeves fight scenes a little hard to swallow - this is still inspiring
theatre, revolutionary in its style and ever-so cool. Frankly, if you
haven't seen this movie, you don't deserve to be here.
