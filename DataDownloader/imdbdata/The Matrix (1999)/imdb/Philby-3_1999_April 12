1999_April 12 

I saw this one three rows from the front, which was a mistake. I also
couldn't help noticing I was about the only person in the theatre over 25.
(I really should have let my son go by himself.) Good computer game,
confusing movie. Naturally loved the Sydney bits (&quot;My God that's our
building's lobby they're shooting up&quot;). Noisy? Very. Spectacular? Moderately
(don't care for the compulsory futuristic grunge). Profound? You're joking.
Good acting? Keanu Reeves has his Stunned Mullet act down to a T.
Unfortunately he was meant to be playing a Christ-like figure. Thought
Laurence Fishburne is reasonably convincing in his &quot;John the Baptist&quot; role
and Hugo Weaving exhibits some evil glee as the multichannel villain.
Romance? Well, there is the nice lady (Carrie-Ann Moss) in the plastic suit
who says she loves Keanu, but doesn't everybody? Action? superabundance
thereof. Not a high degree of accuracy (and pretty obsolete weaponry) in the
shooting but of course that means the gun battles can go on longer.
Inconsistencies. Yeah. Like how come you can only be teletransported using a
fixed phone? Were not cell phones invented so we can all transport ourselves
from and to anywhere? (Maybe its a bandwidth problem.) Recommended? To 12
year olds who love computer game violence and science fiction and haven't
discovered sex, let alone love, yet.
