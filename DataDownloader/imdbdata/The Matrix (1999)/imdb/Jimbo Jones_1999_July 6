1999_July 6 

This movie has the best visual effects ever seen to date, better than
Episode 1's effects. The only problem is though, this movie really is
bad.<br /><br />Every one has been walking around saying, that this movie is the best
ever,
because it has awesome fight scenes, awesome slow mo and awesome visual
effects.<br /><br />They never say the acting is fantastic, they never say the direction is
good, and no one ever talks about the screenplay, because it's all so
dodgy.<br /><br />I have to hand it to the Wachowski brothers and the special visual
effects
team, for coming up with the idea of bullet time photography, it looks
spectacular.<br /><br />DO waste two hours and fifteen minutes of your life to see five different
bullet time photography shots. Don't expect too much from the
acting.
