I remember seeing this film for the first time on bootleg when I was
five years old. I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes!!! The visual effects still
don&#x27;t look phony &#x27;til this very day! And when I watched it again when I
was older and obviously more mature, I love the story line. It made the
movie a million times better! The reason I was blown away again when I
watched it was because of the storyline itself. It just comes together
so well. About this perception of reality and the human race living in
an artificial world made sense for all the action-packed sequences to
cross boundaries. If you like the movie for the action, that&#x27;s fine.
but if you want a full blown movie, here it is. The Y2K of film. The
movie makes sense story wise, emotionally, and even if you judge the
action to look phony, it&#x27;ll all make sense when you see it. Perfect
film. And Keanu Reeves isn&#x27;t too shabby either, and Lawrence
Fishburne&#x27;s performance is very underrated. Trust me on this. You will
love this movie. I know it&#x27;s my favorite movie.
