There is no-one I know who hasn't heard of the Matrix. This, Die Hard and T2
are my fave action films. The Matrix is the pefect action film, appealing to
everyone, including a few excellent action scenes and an interesting love
story that develops over the course of the film.<br /><br />The best scenes in the film are all the bullet-time scenes (The slow-motion
kick is one). And one very excellent fight scene at the end is
brilliant.<br /><br />See this film, BUY IT NOW!!!
