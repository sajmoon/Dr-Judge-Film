After seeing the Matrix twice I finally got why so many people walked out
of
the
theatre still not knowing what the Matrix is, or just not liking it: These
people
are our parents (or the like). It's not their fault. Any generation before
us
couldn't have conceived this film.<br /><br />Everything in it: The visual style, the pace, the computer special
effects,
the
Hong Kong inspired action sequences, the anime inspired characters, the
stylish
ultra violence, and the cyber storyline, was all pointing that many
cultural
and
technological issues needed to be ripe enough for people to get the movie.
The
Matrix was tailor made for-and-by a videogame, internet, cellular, cool
gadget
generation which I'm proud to be part of.<br /><br />After seeing the latest installment of the Star Wars saga I decided that
I've out
grown it. Thank god there's the Matrix. Now I'm ready to move on. Bring on
more cool Sci-Fi!
