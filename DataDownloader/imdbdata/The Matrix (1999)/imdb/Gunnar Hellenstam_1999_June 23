Okay..  Let's see..  First time I've tried to write anything like
this..<br /><br />The Matrix.. &quot;what is the Matrix?&quot; In the movie, the answer given is along
the lines of: &quot;No one can be TOLD what the matrix is..  It has to be seen
for yourself..&quot;  Well..  its about as true IN the movie, as about it.
It's
a brilliant story about a man awakening into a world much different from,
yet still the same as, what he is used to...
It's a movie with Special F/X to make your mind bulge...
It's a nightmare neatly wrapped up in a dream...<br /><br />What can I say?
- Morpheus! I'm ready! Hit me with that jellybean of yours!!
