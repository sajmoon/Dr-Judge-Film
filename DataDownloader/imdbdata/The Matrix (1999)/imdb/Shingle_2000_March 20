2000_March 20 

  Exactly a year ago to the day, two things happened on March 20th. One I
guess I shouldn't talk about (because she'd probably kill me!). But the
other is that I got my first look at 'The Matrix'! All I saw was the
one-minute teaser trailer. It looked mysterious! I knew instantly that this
was something very different and I just had to see this film. I wanted to
know what the 'Matrix' was. And when I found out&#133;! Don't be fooled into
thinking that this film is just going to blow you away&#133; it's going to cause
your head to explode!<br /><br />  The film has a story that has been described as difficult to explain and
hard to understand when watching, but thankfully it wasn't like having to
watch Mission Impossible! Without giving the whole thing away this is what's
happening. You have Reeves playing Thomas 'Neo' Anderson, a computer
programmer for a big company who is also a computer hacker in his spare time
and sells the illegal stuff to the ones who want it. But right now Mr
Anderson has been having some very bad dreams, dreams that seem so real. He
keeps getting told about this 'Matrix' in these strange dreams. I mean just
what is this 'Matrix'? Some suspicious black suited men also want him for
something. He doesn't want to stick around to find out! Soon someone known
as Morpheus (Fishburne) contacts him and explains to him that he also is
looking for him, plus he'll tell him about his vivid dreams and he'll
explain to him just what the 'Matrix' is. We begin to find out that reality
isn't what it seems.<br /><br />  Well what the hell is the 'Matrix'!? Finding out wasn't going to be an
easy task. As the tagline said 'Unfortunately no one can be told what the
'Matrix' is.' So I could see that I was going to have to pay my &pound;5 and go
find out just like everyone else!<br /><br />  The story is original and very unique, taking a truckload of ideas,
thoughts, effects, action and fitting them nicely into something just over 2
hours long. What makes this movie work so well is the strong story element.
It's also one of those really rare sci-fi action films that actually makes
you think. It raises some questions and it has its own answers. But besides
being an education lesson it is extremely entertaining. So entertaining that
it's almost unbelievable that such a film can be exposed to the public! It
manages to make itself so incredibly cool. Take 'Men in Black' and double it
and you're not even half way there. But think a futuristic John Woo film and
you're pretty close! Most of the action takes place in the second half of
the film where all hell breaks loose. The action is very stylish, very over
the top and also well thought out. You don't see someone run up a wall,
dodge bullets at high speed and park a helicopter spectacularly in the side
of a building in your traditional boring 'let's go shoot some bad guys'
action film. This is something very different.<br /><br />  The Matrix will do for special effects what Terminator 2 did for&#133; well,
um&#133; special effects! This is ground breaking stuff. Used to a major extent
in the film are the Flo-Mo effects where the camera circles around the
action. It's unlike anything else and it just looks outstanding! The
shootout between Reeves and Weaving as they freeze in mid air, the camera
goes 360 degrees around them. It's just unbelievable!<br /><br />  Everyone is cast perfectly in their roles with Reeves and Anne-Moss
looking amazingly cool throughout the film. Fishburne looks cool too, and is
helped with the fact that his character is highly knowledgeable. But the
best performances have to go to those black suited men known as 'Agents',
led by Hugo Weaving. They seem so simple and smart, the way they talk with
their monotone voices! They are very, very nasty&#133; and I like
it!<br /><br />  The speedy fight scenes and use of wire frames all work really well,
adding more to the effect of believing the unbelievable! There are so many
unforgettable little touches, which make this movie stand out amongst
others. The way those bullets slowly fly out and make crisp sounds as they
hit the floor, the lush watery effects, even the spoon and of course the
woman in red! She's unforgettable! There's also the nice touch of adding in
a few hidden features which may make the real enthusiast want to watch the
film a couple more times to find everything out. Some will watch it again
because they didn't understand it at all (Though it's usually these people
that hate the film). But I'm sure most will watch it again for the reason
that it's just so damn good!<br /><br />  Those Wachowski brothers have created a masterpiece of a movie. And I'd
just like to say well done to them! I knew that if I was only going to see
one movie in 1999 (just in case I ended up poor or something!) then it was
going to be this!<br /><br />My Rating - I'm afraid I can give it no more then the 10 out of 10 it
deserves!
