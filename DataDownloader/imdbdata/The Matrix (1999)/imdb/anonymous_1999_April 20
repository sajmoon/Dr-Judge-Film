The Matrix has to be one of the greatest movies to come out in a long
time.
And for once, it's not just the special effects that made the movie, the
plot as actually good, and the acting didn't suck. With plenty of
interesting twists and turns around every corning, and  wonderful special
effects, The Matrix is THE movie to see this spring.
