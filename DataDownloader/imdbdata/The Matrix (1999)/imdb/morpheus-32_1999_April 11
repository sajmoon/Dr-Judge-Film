This movie kicks backside. I love this movie. Previously my favorite movie
of the 90's was Dark City, but I enjoyed The Matrix alot more than DC. The
special effects are fantastic, and it will be interesting to see how they
line up against Star Wars  special effects. And an Aussie gets to play a
big
role in the movie!
