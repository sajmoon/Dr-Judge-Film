1999_April 13 

Let me just say, I don't care if you are a person who doesn't 
like Sci-Fi or Action or Cyberspace because everyone MUST see 
this movie.  Forget everything you have ever seen before.  When 
I walked out of this movie I felt like I had just seen the 
invention of &quot;film&quot;.  It is probably my new favorite movie.<br /><br />Granted every movie has it's little flaws, but in this one, the 
flaws are so minute that it's hardly even noticeable.    You 
MUST see this movie.  If you don't see it, you will be missing 
out on a masterpiece.  Make sure you see it in the theater first 
because if you didn't, it would be like wanting to get on a 
roller coaster, but instead of going to Disneyland, you get in 
your car and drive around really fast.  In other words, the 
Theater is the best venue to see this film (if your city has an 
IMAX and it is showing there, even better).
