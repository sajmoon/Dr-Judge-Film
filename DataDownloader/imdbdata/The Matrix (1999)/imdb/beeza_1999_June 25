1999_June 25 

I went in reluctantly and came out, well, impressed.  The effects are
spectacular, there is no getting away from it.  Keanu Reeves is adequate,
it
still remains to be seen whether the boy can actually act.<br /><br />HOWEVER, there must be more clever ways of achieving your objective than
dressing in lots of black and blasting away at your enemy with a huge
arsenal of guns, a la Terminator, or kicking his face in a la Jackie Chan,
even if your enemy is created by the most powerful mainframe on earth.
Perhaps on-line chess?  OK OK, but you know what I mean.<br /><br />Why is the future always portrayed as being so bleak? Even a
computer-generated future seems to be colourless and void of all beauty.
If
The Matrix was a better place for us holographic human batteries to live
in,
maybe there would be no dissidents for the computer to worry about, so it
can't be that clever.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know?  I am just a girl.
