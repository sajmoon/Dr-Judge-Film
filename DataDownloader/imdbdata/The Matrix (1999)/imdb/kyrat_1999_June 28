1999_June 28 

I realize it's hard to be original, and that similar stuff has been done
over &amp; over again... but I was still kind of disappointed when a week after
seeing the movie I was watching an old Dr. Who (from the '70's I think)
where he has to mentally enter into the Matrix to battle the Master who
controlled the reality in the Matrix.  What happens to him in the matrix
happens to his
body in the &quot;real&quot; world as well... he tries to deny that the virtual world
is real &amp; has any hold over him. etc. etc.<br /><br />Although not as cute, Tom Baker's a better actor than Keanu Reeves  and the
ending wasn't quite as predictable either - all it lacked was the fancy new
effects.
