1999_December 18 

It seems to me that The Matrix wants badly to be seen as complex and
intellectual; but the makers were constrained by the type of audience to
which it would predominately be screened in front of. They therefore
compromised by giving it both a script (?) and a male lead (Reeves) which
would appeal to this 16-24 male viewer.
In doing so, yet another potentially mature and clever film has been
sacrificed to suit the young and the terminally thick.
4/10 <br /><br />
