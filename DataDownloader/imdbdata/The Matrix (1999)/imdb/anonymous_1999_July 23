Pretty much all intelligent literature in the 20th century has been
science
fiction, but that intelligence has never rubbed off on movie SF until
now...<br /><br />If you're a literary science fiction fan, you've heard the key plot points
several times each, but this is a fantastic implementation of the virtual
reality/cyberspace concept. As a movie, it's absolutely incredible.
Somehow,
they manage to make it simultaneously a wonderful action movie, a
wonderful
special effects movie, and a good science fiction movie all at the same
time.
