1999_April 8 

I was looking forward to seeing this flick, but was extremely disappointed
when my hopes and aspirations disappeared into cyberspace just like The
Matrix itself. Although the Warner/Village action/sci-fi does have its
moments, most of the movie is just mindless computer hacking, computer talk,
and make-believe environments made by computers. It reminded me of Johnny
Mnemonic (yet another Keanu Reeves action/sci-fi). People have been bragging
about the visual effects, but I'm thinking &quot;What is there to brag about
anyway?&quot;. The Sydney skyline is ever so recognizable, even though the makers
attempted to cover it up by taking out certain landmarks. It's easy to see
that the majority of this flick was shot in a studio, because 90% of it is
dark and in-doors. It's also funny to note that the bad agents, aptly named
Agent Smith and Agent Jones, dress like the MIB and have the same surnames
as the actors who played them.
The helicopter crash sequence was the only thing (apart from the gun fight
in the lobby) that really stood out. You can understand why the ads for this
movie just showed that chopper crashing into the building.....because what
else is there to brag about?!
