1999_June 25 

The beauty of sci-fi is in the details....When writing, an author has
fairly
limitless license to fire the reader's imagination with such
amplification.
A movie has not such luxury. There are time contstraints, dangers of
trying
to do too much. The writers of 'The Matrix' do an outstanding job of
tantalizing the imagination without burdening it with superfluous
information. The visual effects are unparalleled in anything I've seen
recently (sorry George--there was simply too much to see in TPM), and the
presence of humor rounded out this film's combustibility. In addition, the
blending of drag-down, knockout, kung-foo commando is very well-done. My
one
reservation (and the reason why I only gave the film a 9) is the
non-conformity of the romance. It was gauche and heavy-handed.  The
writers
didn't need to dumb things down so much for the viewer. There were several
intimations of what the Oracle had told Trinity, and they could have left
things less implicit in the end...But in a movie where everything else is
done so well, why complain? When all is said and done, I'd equate 'The
Matrix' to the 'Ender's Game' of sci-fi novels.
