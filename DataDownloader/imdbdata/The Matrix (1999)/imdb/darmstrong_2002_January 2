Some people find the matrix difficult to get their head around.  I didn't,
neither did my sister, but I have two references that say it is.  So it's
evens.<br /><br />Even if you don't understand the plot, you'll like the moody look of the
film, the way each actor really does become each character, and the
special
effects will amaze you for hours.<br /><br />This is a must see film.  I didn't watch it at the cinema, when it was on
telly I watched something else, and it took a full two years after it's
cinema release before I bought the thing on dvd.  And now I see what I was
missing.<br /><br />The reference to Titanic in my one line summary is there because the
quality
of the acting is unusualy exceptional for an action film.  Every character
jumps out of the screen and screams &quot;I'm alive&quot; at you.<br /><br />Miss this film at you peril.
