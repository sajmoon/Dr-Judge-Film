I went into the movie theater to see The Matrix because I had nothing
better
to do.  I really had no idea what the movie was about, and didn't care for
that matter.  I especially hate most of Keanu Reeves' movies outside of a
couple.  So I could've never envisioned that The Matrix would have been one
of the best movies of the year, second only to Fight Club.
The plot is just about impossible to explain.  The buildup for the movie
included nobody saying what the matrix was, that you had to see it for
yourself.  I thought this was a catchy tagline, but it ends up it was true.
A truly intriguing plot, that makes you think and a great soundtrack
combine
to make a great film.  It also contains one of the greatest action
sequences
of all time.  If you are a fan of sci-fi or action, you have to see The
Matrix.
