The effects were, wow.  The action, top of the line.  The acting, well
Fishbourne was cool and Weaving was good.  The story...okay, stop right
there.<br /><br />I just can not get into the story of this movie.  I like where they went
with it.  I think that it was original as far as a Hollywood movie goes.
But I just think it went from really cool to just streching too quickly.
If
it had been more about Neo not knowing whether he was in the Matrix or not
at any givin time (ala eXistenZ, which I realize draws far too many
comparisons for the Matrix, much more than the Matrix deserves) or
something
more &quot;mind-bending&quot; than I think it would have been better.<br /><br />They had ample opportunity to make this a great thinkers movie, but opted
to
make it a really flashy action movie.<br /><br />Oh, and to all those people who say &quot;Oh, but it could happen!&quot; Shut up.
If
pulling the plug didn't work, than just sit them out in the rain for a
while.  Belive me, computers are only smarter than humans until they run
out
of hard drive space.
