Keanu in his best action-flick ever (yes better than Speed!) and with
Carrie-Anne Moss and Laurence Fishburne in top shape alongside him nothing
can go wrong. 
Is that true?
Not if Hugo Weaving comes into the picture.
According to me, he steels the whole picture. What a performance!! If you&acute;ve
seen the movie I hope you don&acute;t disagree wth me...He created an excellent
character, and deserves a huge pat on his back.
A big + to The Wachowski brothersfor a supershow, outragous special effects
and the best dialogue in an actionmovie in a looong time!!!
9 out of 10!
