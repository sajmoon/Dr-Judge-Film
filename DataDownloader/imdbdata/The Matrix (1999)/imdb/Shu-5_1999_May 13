1999_May 13 

This movie is the best movie I've seen over the past few months.  It is
kinda hard to understand at times, but once you get into the movie, it
rocks.  I think Keanu Reeves did an excellent job in this movie.
Laurence Fishburne also did a great job playing Morpheus.  This movie has
everything from action to thrilling special effects to a little romance.
This movie is at least worth seeing once or twice.
