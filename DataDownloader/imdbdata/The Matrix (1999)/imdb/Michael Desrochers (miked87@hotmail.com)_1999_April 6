1999_April 6 

That's the way this movie went.  It started off slowly and confusing.
But
the pace was gradually picked up and the last hour was total action and
explosions.  I went to this movie for the fight scenes and actually came
away seeing a movie with a great sci-fi plot and some of the best action
sequences ever.  9.5 out of 10!
