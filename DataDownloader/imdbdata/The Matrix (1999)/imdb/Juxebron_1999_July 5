1999_July 5 

The Matrix is one of the most stimulating and well executed movies I have
seen in quite awhile. I simply cannot understand how anyone would not like
this movie! The visual effects are simply awesome and immaculately done.
There is not one moment when you feel that none of this could be
happening.
This is a movie with action, special effects up the wazoo, and, unlike
most
action films, it has a superb and enveloping story. The story is somewhat
far from everyday life, but that aspect is what makes this film so
mystical
and intriguing. The concept of the Matrix really makes you wonder if
this could be a possibility. All in all, I would say this movie is
definitely worth the trip and the money. Unlike other huge disappointments
(Star Wars, The Mummy), The Matrix is &quot;The One.&quot;
