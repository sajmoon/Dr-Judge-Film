Possibly the best film since Blade Runner. Astounding visual effects and
excellent storyline. Corresponds beautifully to the &quot;Hero Cycle&quot; described
by scholar, Joseph Campbell.<br /><br />Abandon your preconceived notions about the intention and outcome of
&quot;popular&quot; films.  Allow the wonderfully written and acted Matrix to teach
you something new about the reality you're living in.<br /><br />I've seen it 12 times already (own three copies) and it just gets better
with every viewing. I always discover something new.
Must See This Film. Free your mind.
