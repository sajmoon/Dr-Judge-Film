The Matrix is a film that provides quality entertainment for the time and
money invested by the viewer.  It is the first live action to capture the
essence of Japanese anime.  It also has transcendental themes that really
made it entertaining for me.  This is a step forward for the
fantasy/sci-fi
genre.  The action is Woo-ish and the effects are tight.  Best of all, the
movie provokes thought and that is one of the best things a film can
do.
