The Matrix was a fundamentally entertaining film.  However, there were
reverberations of previous films I have seen.  For example, one of these
films is &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.  The Matrix is an influential film, mixing fun
with a serious plot, which has underlying implications in modern life.  I
refer of course to the under-hand and, in some places blatant, disregard
for
human life for the benefit of those in power.<br /><br />The point is, I believe in the Matrix as a true representation of our
oppressed modern society.
