Strangely, Matrix is one of the few action films that open my brain to
deep, profound thinking while at the same time it magnetizes me with
the most brutally good action scenes. Putting together the thinking
line of the new generation, where we are just but pawns in a system we
don&#39;t understand or belong, Matrix also borrows a lot of the oriental
culture with the fights and it&#39;s inner travel over the nature of Life.<br /><br />Little by little one will start to see the light, and everything will
make sense. By the second view, you will get a higher conception. By
your third view this will amaze you. <br /><br />Brawn mixed with brains. The Matrix IS the science fiction film. With a
perfect script that drowns so profoundly into the true nature of
things, and with major, Industrial high tech digital action, I will ask
you this if you haven&#39;t seen the movie:<br /><br />-What are you doing reading this instead??
