There ain't any other movie which can beat this in &quot;imagined realism&quot;. This
can be true. Haven't yet found any idioms or fatal errors in it's logic.
Just great... This really is an easy movie to like. After watching this
movie you really know if your mind is wide enough to understand the
frightening possibility of &quot;dea ex machina&quot; (the machine god) and the
control of big brother. If you miss the link, you live in the Matrix...
deeply, sadly and forever...
