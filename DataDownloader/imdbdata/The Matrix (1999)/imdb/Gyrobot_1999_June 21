1999_June 21 

Well, this film had aroused more curiosity in me than nearly every film
released in the UK so far (including SWTPM but not including Eyes Wide
Shut). A bit of background: I am an admitted Sci-Fi nut. I love the genre
as
a whole and I'm always interested in seeing original new movies in this
genre. I must admit I was expecting a lot more from this film. The reviews
all claimed that The Matrix was an intelligently scripted story with
gob-smacking effects to boot. Surely a combination that has studios
falling
over themselves to produce?
The end result? Well, what you got here is certainly an effects leaden
movie
with A script. Is it as intelligent as we're being led to believe? NO WAY!
This is a Marvel comic book brought to life - not surprising when you
discover that the brothers Warchovsky actually worked as comic book script
writers first and that The Matrix started out as a plot for a comic book
series.<br /><br />The plot is a great concept and one that is currently very in vogue with
Hollywood (see eXiTenZ, Dark City, The 13th Floor etc) but there's nothing
in script that would tax your average 13 yr old kid.<br /><br />In a nutshell it's a sci-fi King-Fu movie. Films like Starship Troopers,
Bladerunner and Alien are all head-and-shoulders above this kind of High
Concept porridge. When will we ever see the likes of a Bladerunner again I
wonder? Probably never, as big bangs now equal big bucks in
Hollywood.<br /><br />Ridley! We need you man.
