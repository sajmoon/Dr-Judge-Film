I actually thought this film was dull. There are some dazzling special
effects, but the storyline lacks cohesion: we never really understand why
these super-intelligent machines saw fit to create this mass
deception/dream
world; I mean, if the machines are simply harvesting humans for energy, why
was it necessary to create this elaborate dream state? Ultimately, the film
reverts to formula with shootouts, chases, kung fu. If you're looking for a
more subtle &amp; satisfying take on the whole reality question, I recommend
Dark City, which is much better thought out &amp; more provocative (unless
you're a teenager who likes to see things blow up or listen to a techno
soundtrack).
I still don't think Keanu Reeves is much of an actor.
