The Matrix is a movie that has done its &quot;historic homework&quot; (so to speak)
and has given us a frightening view of the future if we continue to depend
so much on computers. The special effects are top notch, especially during
the fight scenes and so is the acting.  Newcomer Carrie-Anne Moss delivers
the role of Trinity with enough attitude and sympathy to fit the part
perfectly.  Keanu Reeves improves his somewhat hit-and-miss resum&eacute; with
another gem and excellent role (as Neo) that will open more doors for him
and perhaps give him more respect as an actor.  Finally, Laurence Fishburne
gives his role as Morpheus enough seriousness and intellect to once again
display his broad range of acting ability.  Overall, The Matrix is a sci-fi
romp &quot;think&quot; flick that deserves not to be missed.
