Is the oracle a helpful A1?<br /><br />Since rogue hackers seem to form the main source of challenge to
the A1 running the Matrix, why does it maintain a 1999 culture
full of digital technology and repressive Microsoft style
employers, making the ideal breeding ground for the above? A
simple agrarian society would have kept things a lot quieter for
it ..<br /><br />Where is the appeal of The Matrix? It's not a particularly
clever film in terms of plot, and treads the line very close
between epic tradition and lazy no-brainer, mostly landing well
into the latter. The strength is in the sheer quantity of
references that comprise in to the web of visual and stylistic
elements, and that they are not drawn in simply to fill space,
but with affection and awareness. The plot pivots on the
premise, familiar to eastern (and to some extent western)
philosophical traditions, that the world we know is an illusion,
and that only awareness of that can enable us to transcend it.
This high concept is then pushed into the mindworld occupied by
cults and the paranoid - the illusion is deliberately maintained
by malevolent intelligence outside our awareness, except when
revealed to the initiate by the the informed, or accidentally
discovered by the innocent. The former happens here. In a
classic cult recruitment, the misfit hero is escorted to a
disorienting environment, told he is special in a way he senses
but cannot understand, told his sense of unease in life has a
real basis that can be solved, and offered the choice of
believing, being part of a group, or continuing in unhappy
isolation. A mind-changing drug completes the transaction,
severing the convert's psychological links with his former
life.<br /><br />In this film the paranoid is correct, the cult is indeed a
brotherhood offering a more real reality to the few, the misery
of the world is down to the Moriarty of hackerdom, a control-f
reak Artificial Intelligence, despising (but fascinated by) the
biological kind, and maintaining humanity in uncomfortable
stasis, and in ignorance of the true nature of reality. However,
in the film, reality can be identified and clearly distinguished
from illusion
