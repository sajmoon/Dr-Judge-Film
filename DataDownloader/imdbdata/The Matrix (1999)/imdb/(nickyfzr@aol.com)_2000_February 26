This movie blew me away the first time I saw it. It then went on to blow
me
away every time I saw it there after.Just when you think you found
something
wrong, it makes sense. The only thing wrong I found was in the scene when
Neo gets the phone  from the Fed-Ex guy, you can see somebodies hand in
back of him in the scene. I truly think this is the greatest movie ever
made. Any one who says this movie is not good,not written well, or has bad
acting in its is either jealous or couldn't follow the storyline and it
fustrated them. Can't wait for the next two parts. I would love to see the
movie go back in time to when they pulled trinity out of the matrix. It
would be cool to see her hacker years.Larry and Andy are it.
