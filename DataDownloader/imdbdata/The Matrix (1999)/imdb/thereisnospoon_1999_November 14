1999_November 14 

This movie is just the most awesome that I've ever seen. It not only shows
great special effects, but also gives a very good story-line. I find it
very
amazing, that the actors even had to learn kung-fu for &quot;The matrix&quot;, it
just
makes everything more realistic. I've watched it about 15 times now, and
I'm
gonna watch it again and again. The idea of not being in the real world is
a
thought that probably everyone of us already had before someday in our
lives. This makes this so realistic.
I hate deja vu's. Now I know, why.
