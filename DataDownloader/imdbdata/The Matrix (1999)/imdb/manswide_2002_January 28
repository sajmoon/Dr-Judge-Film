No. If anyone would happen to believe that this idea is new, you're wrong.
If anyone would consider this idea as original or clever... well, then I
can
only presume that you haven't exactly seen lot's of other
movies.
Lawrence Fishburne should be thrown out of Hollywood for doing this. His
character, Morpheus, hasn't got one decent line in the whole movie (his
supposed to be some kind of wise man, but he delivers the most laughable
lines since Ed Wood).
Of course, if you like good effects and action you'll be pleased. Just
don't
expect it to be extraordinary.
