1999_April 19 

The special effects have been getting all the publicity about this film.  I
feel that that was only one of the things that made this movie great.
Granted with out them the movie would not be doing as well as it is but the
story line is what really grabbed me.  It was a movie that made me think and
not just sit there.  For a sci-fi movie to do that is amazing.  On top of
that this is a movie that takes the terminator series to another level.
This is a story line that could be true.  Every bit of it could be true.  I
would encourage anyone to go and view this movie.
