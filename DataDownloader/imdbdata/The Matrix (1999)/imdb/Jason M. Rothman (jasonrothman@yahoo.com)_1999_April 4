1999_April 4 

For once a big budget studio film with an orignal, and complex science
fiction concept.  The Wachowski Brothers take us into a complete and
imaginative universe all their own and they do so with a kinetic visual
style that will get your heart pumping.  The effects are like nothing you've
seen in any other film.<br /><br />It's a fun comic book video game come to life but it's also much more.  At
its heart, the film has a philosophical message: &quot;Free Your Mind.&quot;  See it as
quickly as possible.
