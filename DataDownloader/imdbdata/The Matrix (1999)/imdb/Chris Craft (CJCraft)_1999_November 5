1999_November 5 

I gave this movie a 9 out of 10.<br /><br />This has to be one of the best science fiction movies I have ever seen. It
has great acting, great sets, great action, great themes, great sound, and
most importantly a great story. <br /><br />Background:<br /><br />I am a 24 year old male engineering and computer science student living in
SC. I do have a large humanities background.<br /><br />Overview:<br /><br />This review will be hard to do, since I don't want to reveal anything to
you. This is one of those movies where you want to find out everything for
yourself, like The Sixth Sense. But I can tell you this is an outstanding
masterpiece of the science fiction genre. It will definitely be a classic
for a long time.<br /><br />The level of detail is amazing. For example, they went through the entire
movie and filtered out a lot of the blue and changed it to green. Blue is
too happy of a color they said. All of the sets have extreme levels of
detail. It is almost to the point like in one of the Star Trek movies the
screws on the Klingon weapons had little Klingon symbols cut out of them to
screw them in even though nobody would ever be able to tell. That's the
level of detail we are talking about here.<br /><br />The sound is incredible. I got the DVD version and got to listen to it in
Dolby Digital Surround sound and it was almost as good as when I saw it at
the theaters in THX. If you have a good home theater system then I recommend
this DVD to put it through the paces for you. It really shows off the range
and power of Dolby Digital Surround sound.<br /><br />Not only are the sets and audio full of great detail but the story is to.
The Matrix explains why some people has special powers like being able to
lift and move objects with their minds. It also has an explanation for deja
vu. There are also little gems stuck in the story itself. See if you notice
when Morpheus (the greek god of dreams, see...) asks the traitor to give him
his phone, so he can call the operator, how he stalls until someone else
gives up their phone instead, because he threw his in the trash. There are
lots of these see how many you can find in the first viewing.<br /><br />The movie opens up with a great intense female action scene. You just don't
get to see enough women kicking butt these days. The guys always get to have
all the fun. But not in this movie. The women can give it out with the best
of 'em.<br /><br />I love the special effects. The ship is great. The power plants are great.
The sewer city is great. The sentinels are great. The &quot;bugs&quot; are great. The
&quot;bug&quot; extractor is great. Bullet Time is great. The agents are great. The
oracle is great. It really is just a great movie...<br /><br />The best thing about the movie is it is very human. It really isn't about
the violence, or the fancy gadgets, or the special effects. It is about the
future. It is about us. It is about our will to survive and to make up for
and overcome our mistakes. It is about fighting for what is right and to
fight the good fight. It is about truth. It is about being real. It is about
caring. You will really start to care for this group of
rebels.<br /><br />When you take all of the violence, and fancy gadgets, and special effects
away from Star Wars, you still have a great story that almost everyone
loves. And this movie works the same way.<br /><br />Be sure to check out my other reviews.<br /><br />Thanks.
