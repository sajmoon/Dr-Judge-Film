1999_December 17 

I've seen this film five times on the big screen now within a few weeks (I'm
an operator) and I still love it. So what if some details are wrong,  so
what if the romantic touch is boring and predictable. It has plenty to
compensate. Hugo Weaving is the perfect villain, slithery and mean, the
fighting sequences are among the best ever to be made outside of Hong Kong,
the visuals are astounding. But what is most important: it still held my
attention the fifth time. There are a lot of great films that are still
pretty good a second or even a third time. After that most of them sort of
lose their magic, only to regain it after not seeing it for at least a year.
The Matrix had me sitting on the edge of my
seat every single time within only a few weeks. That's what makes a great
film.
