I have watched The Matrix 5 times in different cinemas, but in the THX
featured cinema, The Matrix was at it's best. The Matrix features action,
sci-fi, suspense and a good story in one, which is very rare. I never
looked
at Keanu Reeves as a great actor but he was perfect in his role as Neo.
Not
only was the acting great, all SFX were superb, like I never have seen
before. The Phantom Menace has also great SFX but it's just a fairy tale,
with no real story.
When I walked out the cinema the first time, the first thing I did was
look
around....... The fact that the world as we know it is just sophisticated
kind of virtual reality and nothing more.
I know one thing for sure, the first DVD-disc I buy will be the one of The
Matrix. I really want to see the making-of. And I already can't wait till
The Matrix 2 will be in the cinemas.
