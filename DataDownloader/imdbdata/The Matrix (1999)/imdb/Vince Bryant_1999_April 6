1999_April 6 

Every movie I see I give a rating somewhere between 1 and 10.  To give
some
perspective, I gave Braveheart a 10, as well as the Star Wars Trilogy as a
whole.  I've given tens to a very small amount of movies, and they've all
been what I consider extremely good films with almost no flaws.  The
Matrix
was amazing, it had me riveted throughout.  Definitely the best action
film
in history, and without a doubt one of my all-time favorites.
