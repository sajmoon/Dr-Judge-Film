1999_September 28 

Matrix is one of the best movies in which the combination of visual effects
and a very intelligent as well as original screenplay is tremendous. The
most common thing in all movies, which have outstanding visual effects, is
that they have a completely unintelligent script and most of the times they
don't respect the spectator's intelligence and aspect. Although I have to
admit that Matrix is completely different. This movie really amazed me. I
recommend it to everybody who has just one time have seen a dream that he
thought it must have been true. I give Matrix 8 out of 10 or *** out of
***** stars.
