By far, The Matrix has been the most creative and outstanding movie I
have
ever seen.  The plot was hard to follow at first but the special effects
made up for it.  I would gladly watch it over and over again.  Reeves did
a
wonderful job portraying Neo, it fitted him well.  I can see why the DVD
is
always out of stock. . . Five stars!
