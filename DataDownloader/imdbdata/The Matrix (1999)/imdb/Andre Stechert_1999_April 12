The Matrix was a supremely well executed movie with a sound story
line...the
main problem with the movie, IMHO, was that even with a 2 hr 30 min
running
time, there are obvious places where character and plot development were
neglected.  A few of the characters lacked enough depth, that it would
probably have been better to have left them out of the story completely.
Blade Runner, by contrast, had a far better balance of very memorable
characters.  The same potential existed for some of the characters in the
Matrix, but only the characters of Lawrence Fishburn, Keanu Reeves, and
one
of the agents really shone through in the movie.  Nonetheless, this one is
a
keeper...
