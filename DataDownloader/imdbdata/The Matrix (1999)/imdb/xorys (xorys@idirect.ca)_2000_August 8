Well... I guess I have to buck a trend here. Apparently everyone liked the
Matrix... heck, apparently even Pauline Kael thought it was good. I thought
it stank. There were two broad reasons I disliked the film. Firstly - it
made absolutely no sense! I can't really go into details here without
revealing too much... but watch the movie and pay attention... listen to
what characters say and watch what happens - it makes *no* darned sense at
all! Now I could have forgiven that, if it weren't for the second problem -
The Matrix is unbelievably overbearing and pretentious! Everything about it
is falsely heavy and pretentious - the art design, the direction, the acting
(well... presumably because of the direction)... if I had to choose, I'd say
the cinematography bugged me the most - vapid and overbearing in the
extreme. Since the movie seems to be intent on hammering the audience into
the ground with its own self-importance but makes no sense whatsoever... it
really completely baffles me why so many people liked it. Now... if you want
to see a worthwhile, intelligent movie on the same basic theme, see The
Thirteenth Floor... a vastly superior film in almost every way (although it
has far less in the way of gunshots, explosions and general
noisiness).
