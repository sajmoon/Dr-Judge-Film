The Matrix is the best movie I have ever seen. There is no movie like it.
One of a kind.
Perception: Our day-in, day-out world is real.
Reality: That world is a hoax, an elaborate deception spun by all powerful
machines of artificial intelligence that control us.
Mind-warp stunts. Techno-slammin' visuals. Kick-ass action. Keanu Reeves
and
Laurence Fishburne lead the fight to free human kind in The Matrix, the
see-and-see again cyber thriller written and directed by the Wachowski
brother. The story sears, the visual effects stake out new movie making
territory - the movie flat out rocks!!
It also has the best gun scenes and action I have ever seen.(chapter
29)
