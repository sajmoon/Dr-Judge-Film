Have you ever noticed  how the Matrix has many scenes that parallel to
the
Bible?  I have been studying this movie in my school and there are a
couple
main parts i wanted to point out that i think parallel to the
Bible.<br /><br />First of all, the movie talks a lot about Neo being &quot;the one&quot;.
Throughout
the Bible Jesus is also known as the one.  Matthew 1:21 says,&quot; She will
give
birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will
save
his people from their sins.&quot;  Jesus was going to save us just as Neo was
to
save the people in the matrix.  Both were also trained.  Neo was trained
by
machine and Jesus was trained while being tempted in the desert. (Luke
4:1-2).  Another similarity of Jesus and Neo is their resurrection.  Neo
was
shot and he died but rose again by the kiss you trinity.  Jesus was
crucified on the cross and rose again (Matthew 28:7).<br /><br />I think that Morpheus is like John the Baptist because they both wanted
to
prepare the way for the messiah. John baptizes Jesus and Morpheus flushes
neo out of his tank and in a sense they are both born again.  People
thought
that John was &quot;the one&quot; and he was only preparing the way for &quot;the one&quot;.
In
the same way everyone thought Morpheus was the one where he was only
preparing the way for Neo.<br /><br />Cipher is like Judas because the both betray the one.  They up the real
thing for the fake world.  They fell for the temptation of riches and
fame
yet both end up dying right after they betrayed the one (Matthew
26:47-49).<br /><br />These are parallels that i see in the Matrix to the Bible.  I find it
quite
remarkable how similar they are.  The Matrix was an exciting dramatic
movie
though it was very confusing at times. I thought it was very well
made.
