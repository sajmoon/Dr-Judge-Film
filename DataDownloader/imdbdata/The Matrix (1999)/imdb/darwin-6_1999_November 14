This is one of the best movies of all time. How one may walk away from this
flick unmoved is beyond me.<br /><br />Everything you know in life, even as you read this right now, is a result of
the facts reported to you by your five senses. If life is fated, or a test,
or a lesson...there is no need for those in control to actually create a
physical world. They could simply manipulate these five input sources to
create a world in your mind. You would never know the difference. This movie
is a complete trip through the philosophical possibilities of
life/reality... it has the audacity to pose big questions, and more
importantly, it asks these questions within the scope of a tight and
stunning visual escapade.<br /><br />You've never seen a movie like this one, its the antithesis of cheese. Its
beautiful, its loud, its colorful, and its hypnotic. Watch this movie with
an open mind, and see the world with fresh eyes.
