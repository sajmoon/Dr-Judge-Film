1999_September 20 

There has been a substantial buzz about this movie, and with good reason. 
The Matrix does an excellent job of wiring the audience into the movie, and
then leading them on a thrill ride.  Allowing the audience to identify with
the main character in all his glory and power, and to desire and lust after
the Trinity character, athletic, intelligent, and attractive.  However, I
believe the adrenaline generated by this movie (which was a great deal)
shrouds some of the other issues.  Neo saved by the kiss of true love (trite
and over used in the movie business).  Hitting the audience over the head
with the implications instead of allowing the audience to come to the
conclusion by themselves.  My friend accurately summed the movies
popularity, in my opinion, by saying &quot;Every class of person loves to be cast
as the hero&quot; and Neo appeals to the young tech heads of today along with the
young athletes and rebels.  I believe the special effects were superb, but I
believe the unveiling of the plot was a little brutal and lacking trust that
the audience would be intelligent enough to draw it's own conclusions. 
Enjoy the movie, for it is truly a wonderful exhibition of the action/sci fi
genre.
