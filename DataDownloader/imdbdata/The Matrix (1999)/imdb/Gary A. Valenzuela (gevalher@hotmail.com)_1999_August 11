1999_August 11 

As the film begins to unfold, one was awaiting how this film
will develop, next the main character (&quot;Neo&quot;), is slow at first,
and fast later, immersed into a total change of his reality and
besides all of these, being credited as the &quot;savior&quot; of the
human race.<br /><br />This flick brings to us some interesting ideas about how &quot;real&quot;
is our reality, but slowly this line of storytelling is dropped
to favor the show of the FX's (outstanding, but more of the time
submerging the story line than reinforcing it).<br /><br />The supporting characters were all dull and plain, and the bad
guys never looks really menacing or chilling. But after all you
can enjoy with &quot;Neo&quot; becoming the savior that he told he
was.<br /><br />Hardly this movie can top &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, film that many
reviewers compares with. But in the end I liked this movie for
the FX's and the original ideas. It's a sorrow that they were
interfering between them, instead of collaborating to do a flick
that may have been a really cool one.<br /><br />Very nice nods to &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (Say bye to Kansas,
Dorothy...) &amp; &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (Follow the white rabbit...)
that leased some thoughts and ideas to this film.<br /><br />A very nice try for the Wachowski brothers, I'll be looking for
another film of them, because I really hope they'll find a way
to improve their storytelling...<br /><br />
