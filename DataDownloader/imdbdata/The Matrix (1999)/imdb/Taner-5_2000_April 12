2000_April 12 

I've seen this excellent sci-fi about 10 times, in German and English, and
each time, seen more subtle details. The MATRIX shocked me, even paralyzed
me by the metaphorical parallels to our society. But what really shocked me
most, was the fact, that some of my collegues hadn't seen more than a rapid
action movie, worth seeing, but not remarkable in any way (&quot;well, Trinity's
a real nice girl&quot;). Obviously the MATRIX can be interpreted according the
needs of the viewer - superficiously just for amusement or with
philosophical implications - so please take the time, the intensity to open
your eyes for the nuances the film offers.
