1999_April 24 

Like others have mentioned, this is a good movie, but its influences are
rather heavy handed.  There was a whole lot of Woo going on in the 'shoot
the pillars' scene..  Even bit off of a prior Keanu cyberthriller movie
'Johnny Pneumonic'.<br /><br />The most impressive part of this movie was style.  Makes me want to run out
and buy a lot of snug black clothes..  This movie is nearly colorless; black
and chrome.  Very well done.
