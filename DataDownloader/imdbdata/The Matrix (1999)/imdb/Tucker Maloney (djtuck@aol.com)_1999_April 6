1999_April 6 

This movie could very easily have been horrible. I thought it would be a
flimsy plot written just to showcase unbelievable computer graphics.
However, it turned out to be one of the best movies so far to incorporate
computerized special effects. The absolutely beautiful style and feel of
the
movie work wonderfully with the computer graphics, the action is well
directed and choreographed, and the story has enough sci-fi to satisfy
hardcore audiences but still entertain the masses. Keanu Reeves still Ted
Theodore Logan's a few lines, but manages to pull of the character. The
Matrix could easily join the cult sci-fi status that Bladerunner holds.
The
Matrix is an incredible movie that makes you think in that metaphoric way
good sci-fi can, and makes you slap high fives for the action. Only one
problem: There is no way Keanu goes from State and Balbo to Chinatown that
fast on foot in Chicago.
