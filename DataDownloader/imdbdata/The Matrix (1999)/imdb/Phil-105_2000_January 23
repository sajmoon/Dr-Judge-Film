<br /><br />       I have not been so over joyed to watch a film like this in ages.It
takes you in a never lets go.The whole film seems like being trapped in a
video game.There is no blood in the shoot outs.Thats because nothing going
on is real.......The agents are awesome as they defend the matrix.The guns
and the lady in leather are awesome.I most say this was better than the the
phantom menace.I say it with true veal.I am one big sw fan and wanted a
little more from tpm.Where Lucas failed on 5/19/99 the matrix
rocked...................You need not only great,visuals,music,actors,sound
plot,mood,directors,script to have a classic.EACH MUST FLOW THROUGH THE
OTHER.The matrix is the greatest scifi film in twenty years period.Two more
films follow.I hope they show how the made guys operate and if the police
are computer simulations or other people locked in the
matrix.................
