1999_May 8 

The Matrix is visually stunning.  The special effects just blew me away.
This movie really made me think about similar movies, such as Dark City,
The
Crow, even Batman.  I love this style of movie, and wish more would be
made
like it.  Although I'm not a big Keanu Reeves fan, he sort of pulls it off
in this movie.  The story, although slightly confusing at first, really
came
together, even though the ending came a little too quick and left me
sitting
there waiting for a more complete finish.  I would love to see a sequel
because I am interested in how this story would turn out...and they could
do
just about anything because it is, of course, set in the future.  All in
all, a great movie.
