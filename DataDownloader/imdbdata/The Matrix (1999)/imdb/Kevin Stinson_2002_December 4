Comparison Between the Matrix and The Life of Christ<br /><br />Neo the main character in the Matrix and Jesus Christ have many
similarities that are very comparable. They were both the `chosen ones',
Neo was picked out of millions of people in the matrix to lead people to
the real truth so that he could free their lives. Jesus was sent by God
to lead people to the truth of God, his father. Neo and Jesus both tried
to free peoples minds, Neo tried to open their minds to the real world;
Jesus tried to open peoples minds up so that they would learn about
their creator.  Morpheus in the Matrix is very alike to John the Baptist
in the Bible.  Morpheus got Neo started on the right path and John the
Baptist, baptized Jesus and got him started in the right direction.  The
group of freed people that are rebelling against the Robots in the movie
represent Jesus' group of disciples. They were both small groups of
people that went around and did amazing things with what little
resources they had.  There are many  interesting parallels
