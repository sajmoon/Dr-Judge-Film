What makes this a great movie? The same thing that makes so many films
great, the story. It is such a good idea and put onto film so well. I
cannot
wait for the next film(s). An original story with good acting and some
interesting twists. It is worth seeing just for the fact that it shows
that
Hollywood can make something that involves the usual action stuff and
effects, but maintains a good plot.
