After seeing the Matrix, I feel like not bothering to see Star Wars:
Phantom
Menace, because THIS is the ultimate Sci Fi film.
This film has plot (which I doubt the new Star Wars film lacks), it
doesn't
rely on loads and loads of CGI to cover a crap story line (hence the new
Star Wars film).<br /><br />Keanu is cool, Laurence is cool, the movie is cool, and in the last half
hour, your jaw just drops to the floor, because the special effects are so
realistic and more believable, than all the Star Wars special editions
versions and including TPM, because you actually think that these things
are
real and it's as if they move without the need for CGI.<br /><br />The flo mo is clever, yet it has been done before, but it's still very
clever the way they use them for a particular shot, and they don't overuse
them.<br /><br />
