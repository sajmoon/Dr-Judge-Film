The Matrix is the typical hyperactive action movie that once you look past
its flash there is not too much substance.  With a really good movie of
this
type, the questions will not arise until after you've been on the
rollercoaster ride.  However, the Matrix doesn't live up to that standard,
which is why it deserves only a 6.<br /><br />Some questions I had while watching the Matrix:
1.  Why do the machines need humans as a source of energy?  Fossil,
nuclear,
thermal even cows, wouldn't be better source?
2.  If the entire Matrix is computer generated by the machines, why do they
run around shooting bullets instead of just bending the situation to their
needs?
3.  How are the &quot;warriors&quot; fueling/repairing their ship?
4.  What sort of power has made Neo the One?  God? The
Force?<br /><br />Overall, the typical one man fight against &quot;them&quot; and all the evil &quot;they&quot;
personify yet in no way exploring what the alternative is once everyone is
freed from their pod.  I would guess The One enslaves them all and has them
erect a temple to his glory.  I'd rather stay in my pod.
