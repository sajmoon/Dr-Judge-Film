If you have to give this movie credit for something, it's for it's
visualization. I'm not only talking about the specialFX (which are the most
important thing in this movie, although not that innovative), but also
about
the way the real and simulated world are brought to you, as well as the way
the dialogues are brought. The only problem with this film is that, however
spectacular everything is shown, what it shows is hardly worth it. The way
Laurence Fishburne speaks his dialogues would just make me shiver, if only
the dialogues weren't that dull.<br /><br />I think this applies for most of the movie's aspects. The story itself
could
have been interesting, they just had to work it out some
more.<br /><br />Conclusion? Nice packaging, not so nice content
