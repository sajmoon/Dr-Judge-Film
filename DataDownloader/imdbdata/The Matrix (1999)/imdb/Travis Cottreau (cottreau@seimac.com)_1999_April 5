1999_April 5 

Setting, general feel and the pacing of this movie are excellent. The movie
starts well and keeps your interest throughout.<br /><br />Sure, the general plot idea has been used by movies and TV for a few years,
but this is the best of the genre of cyberpunk type sci-fi movies bar none
(&quot;Strange Days&quot; would be second). <br /><br />
