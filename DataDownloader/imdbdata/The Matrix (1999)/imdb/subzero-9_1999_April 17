1999_April 17 

The Matrix has the best blend of sci-fi and action that I've seen in a
long
time. I am big sci-fi and action movie fan and an even bigger martial arts
fan. The Matrix superbly mixes Star Wars and Mortal Kombat, adding in some
Bruce Lee and Bruce Willis, topping it off with a little love interest.
The
special effects are so phenomenal they make Jurassic Park look
prehistoric.
The soundtrack rocks! Laurence Fishburne and Keanu Reeves are excellent in
their respective teacher/apprentice roles. I almost never watch the same
movie twice on it's original release, but I've already seen it twice! My
eternal thanks goes out to The Wachowski Brothers as well as the rest of
the
cast and crew for reviving my movie going experience.
