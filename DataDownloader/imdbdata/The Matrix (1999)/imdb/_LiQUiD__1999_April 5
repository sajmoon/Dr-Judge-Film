The Matrix portrays a futuristic concept that forces its audience to
question his/her reality. It doesn't serve up a mere effect ridden action
flick on a platter but rather brings the audience on a fantastic ride that
leaves the special effects coming in second to a profound storyline that
will leave you breathless. It's always nice to see a movie that
isn't
predictable but instead offers suspense and anticipation.
