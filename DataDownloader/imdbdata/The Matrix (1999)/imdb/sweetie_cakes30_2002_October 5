     While watching the Matrix I oberserved quite a lot of parallels
involving the characters in the Matrix to the characters in the
bible.
- The main character, Neo, I thought represented Jesus.  Neo was known as
the one and in the movie he was referred to as &quot;my own personal Jesus
Christ&quot;.  Jesus and Neo were both re-born.  In the movie, Neo was flushed
through the tubes to resemble the re-birth.  In the bible, John the baptist
baptized Jesus to also resemble the re-birth.  Finally, in the end both
Jesus and Neo died, but both died for a cause.  Jesus died to save our sins,
and Neo to died to save the Matrix.
- Cipher resembled the character Judas from the Bible.  Judas was one of
Jesus' disciples.  But not a very faithful one.  In the end he betrayed
Jesus.  He told the guards that Jesus was in the garden and to go arrest
him.  In the movie, Cipher betrayed everybody in the end.  He wanted to save
himself and go back to living his normal life. 
- Morpheus is much like John the Baptist. John the baptist is shown the the
light, but he is not the light.  He is the one preparing the way for the
Messiah.  Much like Morpheus, though you may think he is the one, he knowns
that he isn't and he must prepare the way for the one.  He also has the
power to find the one.  John, baptizes Jesus and Morpheus flushes Neo
through the tubes, which resembles the re-birth.
     In conclusion there are many parallels between the bible and The
Matrix, which I have stated above.  Though I didn't strongly enjoy this
movie I thought it was very interesting to see how similar it is to many
characters in the bible.
