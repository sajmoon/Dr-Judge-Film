1999_April 11 

The plot and concept of THE MATRIX are decades old and will be immediately
pegged by even the most casual of science fiction aficionados, but only
now
is the technology available to put these old ideas into live-action
cinema.
Although very high-tech and effects-ridden, this is not a CGI
extravaganza.
Reeves, Moss, and Fishburne trained months for the martial arts scenes,
and
their accomplished athleticism and physical aesthetic makes this much more
than a 32-bit version of TRON. I think a lot of people will be going to
the
theatre to see this film a second time. There's too much to absorb in a
single viewing.
