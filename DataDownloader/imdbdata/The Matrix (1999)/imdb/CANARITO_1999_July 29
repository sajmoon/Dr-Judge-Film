1999_July 29 

I went to see The Matrix because many people had recommended it to me for
its special effects, and because the history was very good. Even this way, I
had the impression that it wouldn't be what they had told me.   <br /><br />The idea is not new: the man's concern of to be dominated in the future by
the technology that he has invented and that today he controls. Examples of
this argument we have it in the movies &quot; Terminator &quot;, in certain way &quot;Blade
Runner&quot;, and, further on, &quot; Metropolis &quot;.    <br /><br />The history is not sustained by itself. I don't see so clear what
relationship you can have among the logical world of the machines, your
artificial and purely logical intelligence, and the myth of a human legend,
with your mysticism. It is as saying that God will come to solve the problem
of the year 2000. What God have to do with this?     <br /><br />Do they have the machines capacity to FEEL fear that a prophecy is
completed? In Blade Runner an analysis of this probability is made. In &quot;
Terminator &quot; and The &quot;Matrix&quot; it is given of course that yes.   <br /><br />Once this part of the argument is not so clear for me, the movie loses its
interest and it is a mere show of special effects. This is not the movie
that I wanted to see, and that's why it disappoints me. The combats are very
long, the sequences of shots and explosions are boring (mainly the one of
the entrance to the &quot;great building&quot;), and the vision of the supposed
current world, simply not believable.    <br /><br />I would have preferred to see &quot;Terminator II&quot; again, that I found a much
more dynamic and more amusing movie.
