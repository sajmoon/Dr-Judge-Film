I don't recommend that somebody that hasn't seen the Matrix reads this,
becoase there are some parts of the plot in this text.
Matrix is absolytely the best movie I've ever seen, becoase it gives me a
good fealing. I like the sunglasses, black jackets and everything. Matrix
has great music and special effects. The fighting scenes are
impressive.
Some people can't understand this movie. One reason is, that Neo comes back
alive from death:it's impossible. But that's the point:Neo can do anything
he want's to.He's the one.Another reason is,that there is unecessary
violence in this movie.Why do they have to kill so meny innocent people?Why
can't they just fly over them, or something like that, if they can learn
anything they like. The answer:they can't.Can you fly in here?I don't
thinks
so.We have this thing called gravity.For example that stops us from flying
:).Only &quot;the one&quot; can fly inside of the Matrix. That's becoase he can
change
the rules the way he want's to. And in the killing-part Neo isn't the one
yet. He becomes the one when Trinity tell's him that she loves him, becoase
the oracle told her she'll fall in love with the one.<br /><br />10/10<br /><br />
