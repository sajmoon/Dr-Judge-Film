1999_February 8 

I was lucky enough to attend an advance showing of the film..in NYC on
Friday, February 5th..
GO SEE THIS FILM!!!!
It is one of the most incredible, intense...wonderful..exciting..*on the
edge of your seat* films..to come along in a LONG time..very intelligent,
witty,
action packed...Joel Silver introduced the film...and told
us
that it was not completed yet..that only *one* special effect in the film
was 100% done..in the version we were about to see..if this was
*incomplete*..I can't WAIT to see the completed version.  The fight scenes..all done by the actors..no stuntmen..were nailbiting..the wirework is
incredible..It was
nice to see a film of this genre that actually has a really
good
STORY to it as well..GO SEE THIS FILM!!!! Every one of the actors did an
incredible job..Keanu, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss and Hugo
Weaving..who was a trip in this film.  Just knowing the training they went
thru..learning martial arts..it's just amazing...
