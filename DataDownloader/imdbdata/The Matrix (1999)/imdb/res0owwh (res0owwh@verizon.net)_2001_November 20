The Matrix does a better than excellent job of illustrating spiritual
truths
(not religious truths, necessarily, although some religious philosophies
are
illustrated therein, i.e., Luke 1:37 &quot;For with God nothing shall be
impossible&quot;.)  The crew on-board the Nebuchadnezzar can be considered a
spiritual team.  The agents can be considered demons, the neophyte's own
demons which he must overcome in order to transcend the ordinary 3-D
reality.  The agents present to the neophyte his fears, doubts, and
disbeliefs which he must fight against and win in order to fully know
himself.<br /><br />Additionally, the movie depicts planetary control and the majority of
human
beings' unconsciousness in that regard (&quot;Billions of people just walking
around oblivious.&quot;)<br /><br />The members of the spiritual team act as teachers, as well as the agents.
Both teams are considered teachers.  Agent Smith spills a lot of truths.
One team operates from a positive viewpoint and the other from a negative
viewpoint.<br /><br />Overall, the movie will open one's eyes, if one is looking for the
opening.
&quot;Seek and you will find.&quot;  Otherwise, the movie is just another science
fiction flick filled with formula (thrills, chills, trauma, drama, and
theatrics).
