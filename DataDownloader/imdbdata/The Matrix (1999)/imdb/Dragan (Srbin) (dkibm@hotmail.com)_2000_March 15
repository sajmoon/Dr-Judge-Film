2000_March 15 

I heard so much about this movie so I decided to watch it last week. I
extra
set up my Dolby-Digital surround System and my 120cm tv for that special
event.
Oh my I was so disappointed. Keanu Reeves really looks sorry in a movie
that does not make sense at all. If you are in Computer-stuff maybe you
like
it but I work all day with computers and I can say please stop movies like
Matrix to be made.
A few good computer effect`s and that`s it. The acting is really cheap and
I
cannot take nobody serious at all. The plot is the same as when you are
drunk and a lot crazy stuff goes through your head. It does not make sense
at all. After 60 minutes I turned this piece of junk off...
I do not understand how somebody can like a movie like that. Anybody with
a
few good computer specialist could have made it and the story? Is there
one?
What about these days when directors really had to put on their brains
and develop a good story to make a good movie and get the audience into
the
movie. Poor world!
