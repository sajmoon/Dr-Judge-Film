One of the most intriguing movies of the past few years, both visually and
thematically. This one had me recalling scenes and what ifs for days,
which
not many films do.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Fishburne's ever since I noticed his top notch
performance in Boyz N the Hood (1991). Here he is once again in excellent
form. Moss gives a startling performance of her own, while stepping back
in
favor of Fishburne here and there. With all she does, she could have
easily
passed for the ONE herself, but the script obviously intended otherwise.
Most of the rest of the inner-spaceship's crew get developed just enough
for
you to be surprised at who ultimately makes it and who doesn't. Reeves is
credible in his part whether it be in his knowledge or belief of the
Matrix
or in his relation and untrust of the rebels. Even his playing with the
Matrix comes across nicely and - surprise - fittingly. The bad guys are
like
a hibred of the Johnsons from the original Die Hard, the boys from MIB and
a
bit of Max Headroom - hilarious!<br /><br />The camerawork, CGIs and SFX are excellently done and choreographed and
the
plot with its different - at times almost confusing - levels is very well
brought across with just the right mix of fast-paced action and time left
to
explain and reflect upon the new and disturbing developments.<br /><br />Is reality real? Is it imagination? Is imagination preferable to reality?
Where do we practise escapism in real life? What is real life? Is it all a
matter of character? Of rebellious nature? Who are we rebelling against?
Is
the enemy inside?<br /><br />This film poses highly philosophic/religious questions on end and makes
Reeves out to be the - at first reluctant - saviour of humankind while
leaving a lot of other questions unanswered. While that answer of
'self-confidence will get you anywhere' definitely doesn't go conform with
biblical content (Neo/the One is an obviously intended parallel to the One
promised saviour of the Bible - Jesus Christ) Matrix remains nonetheless
an
excellent high-end Hollywood production worthy of all the laurels it has
already received for being just that.<br /><br />BTW: I cannot for the life of me imagine what Matrix 2 and 3 are going to
be
about. I considered the book closed with that spectacular
ending...
