<br /><br />The Matrix, despite some claims, is not just special effects. The film is
visually and aurally stunning but that serves to better convey an idea that
had me thinking long after the credits had rolled. The idea is that the
world we are living in has been created for us...but it's not that simple.<br /><br />In fact, this film is never simple. It's a visual and mental workout:
cinema
at it's best.
