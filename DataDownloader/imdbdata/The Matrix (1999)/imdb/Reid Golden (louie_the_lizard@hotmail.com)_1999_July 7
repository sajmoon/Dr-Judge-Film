1999_July 7 

From the time I first saw the preview to THE MATRIX I knew I would have
to see it. I went around telling people that the movie would most likely
have no plot. But can you blame me? Look around at most of the movies that
today lure you in (I'm  one of the biggest victims of such scams) with
only
their cold, visual, and sometimes superficially stunning effects. But
after
seeing the movie the effects become meaningless and dry. One size does not
fit all, a lesson that THE MATRIX has taught me.<br /><br />Featuring an extremely talented cast (Keanu Reeves, Lawrence Fishburne,
Carrie-Anne Moss), as well as Gloria Foster's  mother-like role as the
Oracle (a seer and a guide in their attempts to destroy the Matrix) and
Hugo
Weaving's role as the &quot;head&quot; agent programmed to kill intruders in the
Matrix, this brilliant film was not only emphasized by the Wachowski
brothers' talents (written and directed), but also by the cast's
extraordinary way of executing their character's personality. Also, I
noticed, the &quot;good&quot; roles were also emphasized by biblical implications
such
as Morpheus's ship being named the Nebuchadnezzar and the last human city
being named Zion.<br /><br />Perhaps it wasn't realized when the thought of the picture was being
conceived, but by the plot being to erase all reality allowed Andy and
Larry
Wachowski to re-write all the rules of so called &quot;reality&quot; and format it
to
whatever their imagination could spawn. In short, by doing this, they
could
do nothing to contradict &quot;reality&quot; in any way.<br /><br />In spite of all this, I do have to admit that the whole plot of this
movie
may not be fully comprehended the first time you view it. I myself have
seen
this movie twice in theaters and the details are still slightly fuzzy, but
every time is just as enjoyable as the next. What is the Matrix? I'll tell
you the same thing I tell everyone else, you'll have to see it for
yourself.
It may even make you suspicious of the world around you and question
&quot;reality&quot; its self.
