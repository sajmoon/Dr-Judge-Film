when i first saw this movie i was spellbound. i had never seen a movie like
it before and probably won't until the sequel arrives at my local movie
theater. the wachowski brothers, two filmmakers unknown to me before this
film, soar into my favourites list.
this move has it all. great story, great action, good acting (especially
from Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishburne) and great special effects and
photography.
