This movie is one of the first, I think, that did not exaggerate the
computer world like others did and fell into cliche. Of course, they kind of
put the things in a way that everything would be possible. This movie is
what Star Wars was when it first came out. The movie from guys from nowhere
that know how to put a story on screen. I just can't wait for the
sequel.
