1999_July 1 

The matrix has some of the best FX i have ever seen. However , the FX
hardly
out-weigh the low points in the film, mainly , THE WRITING . The basics of
the matrix are that it is so badly written , that a movie buff such as
myself who has seen all the tricks, and knows how they are done, just
doesn't impress me, in fact , some of the dialogue is so terrible that it
is
funny!
I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who over-thinks it too much ,
but
if you are just looking for a wild ride, see the matrix.
