A Maximum --full--out Kick-butt Movie---This one has it all Babe: Saw it
3x's in the theatre, and now with a video-copy likely a half-dozen more or
so: Watch for the 'Black-cat' and Check for 'Kansas City is goin' &quot;Bye Bye&quot;
This is the 'coolest' in Mind-trip films put out in a long time-also
check-out the 13 th Floor for a different take on a similar journey!---Just
strap yourself in and Hang-on--It goes weird and wonderful places!   Enjoy!
