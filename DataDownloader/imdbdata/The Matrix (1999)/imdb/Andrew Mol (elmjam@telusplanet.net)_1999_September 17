1999_September 17 

The matrix is the best movie I have ever seen and I have seen thousands of
movies. The FX and the action + acting is the best I have ever
seen!!!<br /><br />I give it 11 stars out of 10<br /><br />You must go see this film on a big screen for the full
effect.<br /><br />I promise by the time the movie is over you will have a different look on
life!<br /><br />Go see the film now you will not be disappointed
