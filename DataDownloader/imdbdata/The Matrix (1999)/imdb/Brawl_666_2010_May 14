&#x27;The Matrix&#x27; must be one of the most ambitious and highly successful
projects of the past twenty years. Its difficult to imagine how this
film could have gone from conception to execution, and succeeded with
such flying colors. For a long time I&#x27;ve avoided writing a review
because this was my &#x22;Godfather&#x22; or &#x22;Star Wars&#x22; movie, having first seen
it at 13 and instantly falling in love with it. I could never be truly
objective about this movie, nor could I find a single truthful,
objective analysis of it anywhere on IMDb or RT. Roger Ebert&#x27;s review
was nice, but too harsh.<br /><br />&#x27;Bound&#x27; helped me appreciate better how &#x27;Matrix&#x27; was conceived. Neither
of these two films has a single wasted moment. It seems that the
Wachowskis build a film by cascading a set of scenes, like a series of
dominos, so that each scene projects into the next one. This is of
course what all screenwriters do, but as simple as it sounds, it is no
mean feat. The most important part of any film, I think, is how you
connect scenes, how you work on transitions so as to create meaning and
plausibility. What you show, how you show, and most importantly, what
you Don&#x27;t show. This is extremely difficult. It requires a deep
understanding of the cognitive mechanics at work between a film and a
viewer. It is, if you like, the most important part of film-making, as
important (if not more) than the actual shooting process.<br /><br />The brothers nailed this whole conception business down to the last
detail. The editor won an Oscar, but the film was streamlined by the
directors for perfect editing. The cinematography and sound design is
breathtaking. Joel Silver brought another influence to bear in terms of
production expertise. They worked on the formidable design and effects
requirements, even bringing in a legendary Hong Kong action
choreographer for the martial arts scenes.<br /><br />And then they made casting choices that could not have been better.
This film rests on the visual and vocal libido of the leads. It works
only because the actors work, because we relate and identify with them.
Just watch Weaving and Fishburne scorch the frame in their respective
parts; these are their best roles. Moss is visually apt. Reeves is
unwittingly perfect for his role, more perfect than anyone could have
imagined.<br /><br />Another important part of this film is the self-reference. This film
riffs on itself many times in many ways, such as when Mouse asks Neo
how the machines could possibly know about the taste of Tasty Wheat.
This is essentially winking at the viewer by momentarily snapping the
plausibility of the whole idea. Also, this whole franchise is one big
stab at the Terminator movies and their enduring popularity. Instead of
time travel, we have virtual reality. Instead of terminators, we have
agents. Instead of John Connor....<br /><br />None of this explains how they came up with this concept. The keystone
of the arch is hidden. There are countless other &#x27;influences&#x27; here :
Phil Dick, William Gibson, Doctor Who, Grant Morrisson&#x27;s &#x27;The
Invisibles&#x27; etc. And as with Tarantino, we are unable to say for sure
whether it is homage or plagiarism. The innovation lies in the
architecture of the whole thing, in the layering, in the flawless
integration of so many different design elements to form a seamless,
coherent entity. The Matrix is everywhere indeed.<br /><br />This is the only way to make movies.
