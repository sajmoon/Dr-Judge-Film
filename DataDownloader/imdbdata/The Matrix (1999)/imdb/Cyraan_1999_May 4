1999_May 4 

This movie is truly one of the best ever made.  Never has special effects,
plot, and Keanu Reeves been put successfully  in a movie so well.  The
plot
was very good and really made you think.  The special effects were some of
the best ever. I would recommend this movie to anyone.  Especially sci-fi
fans, and those who like movies that make you think.
***** out of *****
