Thomas Anderson (Reeves) is computer analyst by day, and a computer hacker
by night under the alias of Neo. He is saught out and found by a man called
Morpheus (Fishburne) who believes Neo is 'The One' for The Matrix. he is
then taken out of his dream world which he lives in and brought to the real
world, The Matrix, is as it seems a computer generated dream world, in which
we live in, and people in the dream world can enter and exit freely as they
want. The only problem is agents led by Agent Smith (Weaving) who is trying
to steal a code to wipe out human existance as we know it, and Neo is the
person Morpheus needs to help him. Starring many Australians including Matt
Doran (Home and Away), Belinda McClory (Blue Heelers) Ada Nicodemou (Home
and Away), this movie proves that Australians can make good movies (im
apologising on behalf of all australians for any bad australian movies you
may have seen, and if you count The Castle as a bad movie there is something
wrong with you!!!)<br /><br />So as i was saying this is a very good action movie (especially the fight
scenes between Fishburne Vs Reeves, Reeves Vs Weaving and the gunfight
scene. Top Stuff<br /><br />10/10
