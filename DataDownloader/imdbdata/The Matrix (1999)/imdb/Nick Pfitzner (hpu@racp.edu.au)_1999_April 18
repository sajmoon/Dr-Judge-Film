1999_April 18 

For pure entertainment value and a film that left me wanting more, this is
it! Be warned that I'm not going to examine The Matrix on a metaphysical
level, or compare it directly to anything as some people have done. I went
in with no preconceptions or expectations, and obviously walked out more
satisfied than many who did.<br /><br />I'll discuss the plot line of the Matrix down further, but for now I will
say the only problem I had with any character was Reeves' &quot;whoa&quot;. This,
combined with his accent, can't help but remind you a little of two guys
in
bright clothing having excellent adventures in a phone
booth.<br /><br />Reeves plays very well the hacker suddenly exposed to the truth, adapting
to
his environment with the ease of those enamored of information technology.
He hungers for knowledge, seeks the truth, and wants answers to his
questions. He doesn't receive all the answers, but he knows his battle
with
the AI society of the Matrix will bring him closer.<br /><br />Fishburne is great as the enigmatic Morpheus. At first complex, his simple
belief that Neo is The One pushes him on in his quest, and we see his
simple
dedication to humanity evident in the pains he goes through to protect
Zion.<br /><br />Carrie Anne Moss is excellent as Trinity. (I have to say that &quot;Dodge this&quot;
was one of the cooler moments for me in the film - yeah shallow I know).
She
does the kick a** female with a confident, yet fragile femininity that she
only exposes in humanity's hour of need.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving. What can you say? As a proud Aussie, I am completely
satisfied
with his performance as the spine-chilling Agent Smith. A lot of people I
talked to were really annoyed by his accent, but I felt that it suited an
AI
program attempting to fit into a human society and develop human traits.
His
icy, blank faced portrayal of Agent Smith (with Agent Jones and Agent
Brown), really carried the uncaring authority figure of the Matrix into
the
human world.<br /><br />Weaving, along with other Australian/New Zealand actors (Matt Doran as
&quot;Mouse&quot;, Belinda McClory as &quot;Switch&quot;, and Julian Arahanga as &quot;Apo&quot;, along
with the agents and a host of extras) gave good background to the other
characters, even though their roles were short lived. Hopefully we will
see
a lot more local talent in upcoming features (Star Wars Episode II,
Mission
Impossible II).<br /><br />Joe Pantoliano makes a great Cypher - the disillusioned follower of
Morpheus.<br /><br />The parts of Tank and Dozer were ably played by Marcus Chong and Ray
Anthony
Parker, as the only two &quot;real humans&quot; we saw in the whole film. You see in
Tank and Dozer a happier, more positive attitude, having been born in the
human outpost of Zion, and believing implicitly with Morpheus that Neo is
The One.<br /><br />The special effects strength were nothing short of unique, with the
combination of Hong Kong wire cradles combined with unreal, &quot;computer
generated&quot; settings and wardrobe, and slow-mo &quot;moment in time&quot;
multi-camera
techniques. That is all I have to say on the matter, because they have to
be
seen to be believed.<br /><br />I have a problem with people who knocked the film. Most of their reasoning
probably stems from the fact that they are addicted to their own flavour
of
sci-fi (and there is NOTHING wrong with that), or expect high philosophy
every time they walk into a cinema. I accept that there were parts that
they
didn't like, but I feel that rather than trying an all-encompassing tale
told from start to finish, the Wachowski Brothers were showing us a small,
but important part of the world of the Matrix.<br /><br />Everyone who has watched a sci-fi feature film knows that in no real way
can
the director(s) give us the entire history of their unique world in 3
hours
or less. The Star Trek movies, for instance, have whole series' to back
them
up before they hit the big screen. Conversely, &quot;Dark City&quot; stood alone,
and
people who didn't like it often said that &quot;not enough was explained&quot; (as
they did with the Matrix), or compared it to other, better established
series/films. Was everyone disappointed with &quot;Star Wars&quot; when it was first
released? NO! They went in, saw a good film with simple plot ideas and
characters, got their money's worth and walked out. I think somewhere
along
the line we just got too fussy, and we forget that it's a movie -
entertainment for a couple of hours.<br /><br />I had no preconceptions that this movie would give me the history or end
of
the world. I say honestly went in to the cinema looking for a story on
&quot;lotsa guns and kicking heads&quot;, not to mention the unique special effects.
I
was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The concept of the Matrix running our lives was an important part of the
film. I accepted this, but did NOT wait for some quasi-religious
justification to develop from this. It was simply a fact taken into
account
by Morpheus and his disciples when combating the Matrix in their search
for
&quot;The One&quot;. It was no character's task to analyse this on a metaphysical
level - their task was to begin destruction of the Matrix, and this was
all
that the Directing and Editing crew could fit into this movie time
frame.<br /><br />There is room for sequels here, (like others, I want to see Zion) and I
hope
that it will again be the Wachowski brothers at the helm, to continue
their
vision in the style to which we have become accustomed. The Matrix gets
10/10.
