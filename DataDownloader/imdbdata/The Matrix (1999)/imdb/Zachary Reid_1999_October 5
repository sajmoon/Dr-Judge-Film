And just when I thought nothing mainstream would ever again be as bad as
Striptease, this comes along. Wow! Keanu Reeves wins the Jon Voight award
for wooden dialogue, and Laurence Fishburne gets a nod for good actor gone
bad. Give me a break with all the Alice in Wonderland references and vague
scenarios. I'm no film snob--I like Chevy Chase and Bogart just the
same--but I have to say the Matrix came across as a poor imitation of a
master. It looked like a script Kubrick would have rejected as mediocre,
then filmed by directors perhaps better suited to music videos. View at your
own risk.
