This movie got a ranking of ten despite having Keanu Reeves as the main
character. It accomplished this miraculous feat because good ol' fish-face
has the best line of the movie; &quot;Woah.&quot; I must have said it a hundred
times
while watching this movie. And I never meant it as a bad thing. Amazing,
amazing movie. Great villains, cool good guys, Laurence Fishburne in tiny
sunglasses, the wierdest kind of God imaginable and fight scenes that
leave
you so stunned all you can say is &quot;Woah.&quot;
