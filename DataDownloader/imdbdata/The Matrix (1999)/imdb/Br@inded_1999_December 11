1999_December 11 

The Wachosky brothers bring us the Blade runner of the 90's . Actionpacked
Philosofickly full and special effects wide .
Keanou reaves more than makes up for the weak Johny Mnemonic .<br /><br />If you are openminded , be prepared for loads of entertainment . Thinkers
might adore the first part of the movei and FX fans the battles will keep
you more than stunded . Everybody get ready for a total mindteaser . The
success of this filf is good acting , great storyline but also greatlly
detailed special fx . The only problem is that it still cant get off
certain
cliches . E.g the hero is killed but because of a kiss he is brought back
to
life . Still this is one of the best movies of the decade . View or Die
:)
