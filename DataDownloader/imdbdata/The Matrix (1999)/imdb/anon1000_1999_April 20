1999_April 20 

When I saw the trailer and making of this movie, I was expecting something
special. However, when I went to see it, I was completely blown away. As
well as this being a special fx/action film, it's a special fx/action film
with a PLOT!! (gasp!!) And the special effects, ohmigod, I've never seen
anything like it. People running up walls with complete fluency, the entire
side of a building exploding after a helicopter slams into it, sending
fragments of glass everywhere, I was left completely speechless. But as well
as all of this, this movie has a sense of humour as well!! I have gone to
action movie heaven!!<br /><br />I have three words left to say SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!
