Fast, Witty, Stylish, Sexy, it can only mean one thing...a good action
flick!
Many people have tried to figure out just what world they live in...Neo
(Keanu Reeves) gets that chance. he meets a man with more answers than you
can amagine-that man is Morpheus-a man that Neo has been trying to find for
nearly all his life. Suddenly Morpheus (Lawrence Fishbourne) takes Neo into
the Matrix gang and a fast-paced stylish action thriller is
produced.
I must give this ***** out of *****.
