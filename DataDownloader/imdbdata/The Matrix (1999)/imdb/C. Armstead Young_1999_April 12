1999_April 12 

The Matrix is one of the best films I've seen.  A good film in my opinion
is
one you have some identity with.  No, I can't identify with running on
walls, shooting people and being deemed the chosen one.  But I CAN
identify
with being trapped in a cubicle, living a life I'm certain I'm not
supposed
to be in, and knowing there's something more out there.  Not necessarily
better, but more.  By now you know what it's about, not going there.  But
it's pulled off fabulously.  They could've gone more in depth here and
there,
but as it was the movie was almost 2 1/2 hours long.  And please, give
Keanu
Reeves a break, he's not Olivier but he knows how to choose roles.  If you
notice his better films all have a top-notch actor to carry the heavy
stuff,
Fishburn, Pacino, Hopper, Oldman, Morgan Freeman.  Keanu uses screen
presence and looks to maximum effect.    The Matrix was
on.
