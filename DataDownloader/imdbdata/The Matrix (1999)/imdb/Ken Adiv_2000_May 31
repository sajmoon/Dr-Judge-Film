Extraordinary intellectual and/or creative power.
(Dictionary definition)<br /><br />This film is cinematic genius.<br /><br />An amazing plot combined with super special effects never before seen in
the
cinema make this movie a modern work of art and one of the best movies of
all time.<br /><br />The depth of the characters in this movies is more than meets the eye -
besides the characters themselves, each one excellently performed, the
names
and the general plot suggest mythological characters, some with a role
similar to the roles of those in the movie.<br /><br />The movie, technically speaking, is filmed to absolute perfection - after
watching this film over and over and over and over, i have not found one
single technical goof. Whatever video/computer techniques the makers of
the
movie used for the special effects is totally transparent to the watcher -
unlike older movies, where you could tell a computer or plastic doll or
whatever was being used, in this movie all you see is the real world (as
real as it gets in this movie...) and everything that happens (visually)
is
totally believable.<br /><br />The plot, although being a far out science fiction plot, is believable,
technologically speaking. The extremely scary thing is, though, were this
already true - most of us, just like in the movie - would have no way of
knowing that we were what we were...<br /><br />As for the movie itself - there is not one unnecessary second in the film.
Smooth, high action from beginning to end.<br /><br />The only movie that has ever gotten an 11 out of 10 rating from me, this
movie is one league above all other movies in it's genre, and is the next
level in sci-fi and special effects.<br /><br />If you have not seen this film, go do so NOW. I personally have not met
one
person that didn't say this film was excellent, to say the
least.<br /><br />11/10
