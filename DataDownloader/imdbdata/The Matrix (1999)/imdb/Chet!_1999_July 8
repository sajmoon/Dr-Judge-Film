1999_July 8 

Having read as many of the comments below as is humanly possible, I would
have to say that I agree with all of them, positive or negative. The
effects
and fight scenes are, of course, flawless, but any pedant worth their salt
will find plenty wrong with the plot and character motivation. But seeing
as
it attempts to deal with some intellectual concepts (semi-successfully),
it
would probably be wrong to criticise it too much, existing in a Hollywood
where directors usually do as much as possible to keep the docile masses
from exercising their grey matter. The Matrix is flawed, but as an action
film it is (like T2) a step in the right direction.
