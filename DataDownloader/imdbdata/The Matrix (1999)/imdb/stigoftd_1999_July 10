1999_July 10 

I went along to this film expecting to see a run-of-the-mill, standard
the-big-guys-are-out-to-get-me affair - it's all been done, hasn't it?
Wrong!<br /><br />The baddies are bad, the goodies are good, and there is no grey area. It's
a
perfect film in that way, in that you don't have to think for it to tumble
along. That leaves it open for the ratehr complicated and frankly
terrifying
concept at the heart of the Matrix to come to the fore, and it does, with
electrifying pace and sparkle.<br /><br />Yes, it's deep. Yes, it's intellectual. But hell, what cool fight scenes!
The plot works in such a way that people can do Nike-ad-style jumps over
buildings and the sort of martial arts moves that aren't usually seen
outside
of Mortal Combat, and they look SO cool!<br /><br />This is one of the few films I've seen that affects you for a while AFTER
leaving the cinema. All films affect you in some way - but this film made
me
look about and go &quot;Is it all real?&quot; It's great, and very
enrtertaining.<br /><br />Incidentally, be prepared for the Star Wars blags. Most notable of these
are
when Morpheus is talking about the Matrix &quot;It binds us, and holds the
universe together&quot; and &quot;It also obeys your commands!&quot;, as well as the
obvious &quot;You must go to the Degoba system for your training!&quot; These get
laughs when they're not supposed to, but only for me, 'cuse I'm like
that!<br /><br />Bad points? Well, It may be a little slow for some people - I personally
didn't think so, but it takes a while to get to where it's going. Mind
you,
when Keanu wakes up in that tank - it's just such a shock that it's worth
the wait.<br /><br />All in all, a very good film. At the time of writing, it's rated as the
20th
best film EVER on the IMDB rating - a bit high, but it's understandable. I
found myself humming Strawberry Fields Forever &quot;Nothing is Real&quot; through
the
film - when I start humming tunes, you know it's a goodun!<br /><br />In summary, go watch this film if you like to think a bit, but like cool
fight scenes and plenty of drama. The romance knackers it, but hey - it
ain't a love story!
