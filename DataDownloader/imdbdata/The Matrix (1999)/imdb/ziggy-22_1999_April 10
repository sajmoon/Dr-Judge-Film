&quot;Follow the white rabbit.&quot;  A notorious computer hacker receives a
mysterious message on his computer.  His decision to further investigate the
source and meaning of this message would irrevocably change his life
forever.<br /><br />This fast paced and rather complex plot is entertaining on many levels.
While most viewers will be content with just the stunning visual effects and
unbelievable martial arts sequences, others will enjoy the clever references
to Lewis Carroll and Douglas Hofstadter.<br /><br />Unusual camera angles combined with a viewpoint that is rarely stationary
make this film a visual roller coaster ride.  The plot is equally fast and
filled with turns and twists to keep most viewers on their
toes.<br /><br />While most eyes are on Keanu Reeves, the sleeper of this film is Lawrence
Fishburne.  His compelling performance as the enigmatic Morpheus is
outstanding.  He plays it so well that the viewer is not sure if Morpheus is
a good guy or a bad guy, a Zen master or a blind faith fool.  Or just maybe,
just maybe, all of the above.  His performance is worth serious
consideration.<br /><br />The film, by tackling the sacred cows of philosophy and offering an
unconventional scenario, will stimulate and amuse most viewers yet may
offend or upset others.  Take the scene where a little boy, dressed as a Far
Eastern monk, bends a spoon by just looking at it and explains, &quot;the spoon
does not exist.&quot;  While this works within the context of the film, it may
offend those who take their Far Eastern philosophy seriously.<br /><br />In the end, the film forces the viewer to ask if one would accept a
horrifying, uncomfortable and disgusting truth over a pleasing, comfortable
and attractive lie.  Think before answering too quickly on this
one. <br /><br />
