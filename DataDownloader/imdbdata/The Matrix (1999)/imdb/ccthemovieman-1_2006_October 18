Special-effects were the drawing card when this came out at the end of
the 20th century, and those effects were spectacular. They lived up to
their billing. <br /><br />Unfortunately, the story was a bit confusing for much of the two hours,
a bit too secular-minded for me, although others have viewed this with
Biblical analogies. I do think the script could have used some humor
here and there. It took itself a little too seriously. That was
especially true for the four main characters.<br /><br />Nonetheless, because of the stylish visuals and effects, it
entertained. I liked the monotone-speaking Hugo Weaver the best, or at
least found him the most interesting. Lawrence Fishburne&#39;s character
came in a close second in that regard. <br /><br />Once again here&#39;s a movie that made you glad VHS tapes were being
phased out in favor of sharper, widescreen transfers.
