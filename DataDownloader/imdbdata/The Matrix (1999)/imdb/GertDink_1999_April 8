1999_April 8 

Unbelievable... absolutely mind-blowing eye-candy..  If you haven't seen
this movie yet, SHAME on you....  This movie is an oasis for us EGGHEADS
who
just love 1. Anime!!!
2. Martial Arts!!!! 3. Computers!!!  I haven't seen a movie this well done
since Fifth Element.. and even that looks low-budget compared to this gem.
Matrix actually left me breathless at some points..<br /><br />For those people who supposedly thought Matrix was &quot;just like Dark City&quot;
and
&quot;so unoriginal&quot;....go throw yourself off a bridge.  This movie has
EVERYTHING in one beautiful package....  The plot is excellent, and
maintained for the duration of the film... the action scenes are INTENSE
and
so gorgeously executed you forget that it's just SFX... and for grape's
sake... the actors/actresses are STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL...<br /><br />As corny as this sounds... I have to say it.<br /><br />MUST SEE MOVIE OF THE MILLENIUM! LOL
