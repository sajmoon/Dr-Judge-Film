Basically all the Matrix Movies are the very Best Action / SciFi Movies
I have ever seen. I did not see them at their original debuts at the
Cinemas, yet I have seen the DVD&#39;s. Never have seen an Action Movie
come close to the amount of excellent special effects, great scripts,
and super suspense - Will continually vote 10 out of 10 for the Matrix
Series. I watch at least 1 or 2 action films per week either on DVD, on
Limewire, or at CinemaNow or MovieLink online. The Matrix (3 movies) is
definitely the best movie(s) I have ever watched. Seriously don&#39;t know
how they are going to be out done... Hope that you understand the
Movie, I know folks that have watched it and don&#39;t understand the
&quot;matrix&quot; and when the actors are in the &quot;matrix&quot; - anyway, 10 out of
10. Or 100 out of 100.
