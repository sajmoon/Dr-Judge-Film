The Matrix is a visually stunning movie about a new reality that has been
created for us by computers. With the creation of AI we see the demise of
our own civilization and the rise of a new electronic one.<br /><br />With special effects enough to keep even the most visual hungry person
happy
the combination of suspense, action and a plot that gets you thinking this
movie has it all. What i considered a sensational performance by Laurence
Fishburne i recommend this movie to just about anyone. Whether they are
into
action, computers and especially gun fights or martial arts. A top movie
that will definitely make it on my DVD list...
