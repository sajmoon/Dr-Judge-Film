2000_April 9 

after all I had heard about this movie and the number of awards it got, I
was expecting a lot more....<br /><br />after dredging up the old 'super-smart computers taking over the world
theme' it was down hill after that<br /><br />the dude in the trench coat kept making this big deal that you can control
everything you want in the matrix, and yet the real people keep running
around like chickens with their heads cut off....and exactly how did he
not
get touched by that chain gun from the helicopter?<br /><br />what kind of self-respecting super computer would let a bunch of pathetic
humans screw around with the program anyway?  why hasn't it squashed them
long ago?  shouldn't it be aware of everything going on at all
times?<br /><br />I guess the self-righteous humans don't mind killing their own to further
their own plans as well....who cares about all the police and security
guards..they're just in the way I guess<br /><br />and finally, last time I checked, love's first kiss to awaken the dead is
only in fairy tales...GIVE ME A BREAK!
