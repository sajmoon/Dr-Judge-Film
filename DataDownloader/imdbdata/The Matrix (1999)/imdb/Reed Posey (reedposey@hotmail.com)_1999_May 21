1999_May 21 

Remember the movie &quot;It Could Happen to You?&quot;  It starred Nick Cage as a
cop
who wins the lottery and splits the winnings with a local waitress.  Well,
I
thought this movie was much more believable overall.  Not a bad feat for a
sci-fi flick.  I've read several negative reviews by other imdb members,
notably one that said the matrix was trying to be a William Gibson novel
movie.  I found pretty much everything this person wrote to be
unsubstantiated gibberish.  I'm not sure what the author would have done
differently had he/she (I don't know any females this bitter) been given
the
script and budget... but I bet it would resemble &quot;Wing Commander.&quot;
