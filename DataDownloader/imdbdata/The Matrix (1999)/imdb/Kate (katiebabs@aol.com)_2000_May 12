The Matrix just blows you away by the effects that can't be discussed, you
just need to watch and by amazed. The plot is a little crazy and strange but
it is a true sci-fi movie for the next generation. Are things real as we see
them or just an illusion? This movie asks this and so much
more.<br /><br />PLOT: A young man (Keanu Reeves) is disilusioned with life until he meets a
man who shows him everything is not what it seems, even his
life.<br /><br />VIEWS: The acting is okay, the story could have been better but nothing
really matters except for those mind boggling effects. This movie set the
ball rolling for other movies. Forget the next Star Wars movie, just be
amazed by what the next two movies will bring. Alot of questions are raised.
The Matrix is a hard movie to comment one because it could be so many
things. You are the one to make your own decision about it from being amazed
to wanting out.<br /><br />SCENES TO WATCH FOR: The fight between Keanu Reeves and Lawerance Fishburne,
the Matrix journey, and those great effects which is in 90% of the
movie.
