Despite the fact that Keanu Reeves couldn't act his way out of a wet bag, I
was very excited to go see The Matrix because it had Laurence Fishbourne
who's a very good actor and the previews were visually stunning. 
Unfortunately, the special effects were the only things stunning about the
movie, unless you count how stunningly stupid the dialogue was, or how
stunningly bad the acting was (even good actors like Fishbourne and Joe
Pantalione couldn't get anything out of this script).  The filmakers here
took a wonderful concept, filled it with marvelous special effects and left
it to die without any substance.  If it's enough for you for a movie to look
good, then you'll love this film.  If, like me, you need an interesting
story, good dialogue and acting, don't bother with The Matrix.
