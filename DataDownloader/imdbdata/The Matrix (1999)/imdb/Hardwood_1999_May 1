1999_May 1 

I was expecting so much more...  I mean, everything good that happened in
the actual movie, you saw in the previews on TV.  From the previews, I was
figuring there would be so much more cool stuff in the movie.  But there
wasn't.  But, don't get me wrong...  I still didn't mind the movie.  I
like
Keanu Reeves and I love Laurence Fishburne, they both did a good job.  One
more thing, I really didn't like the fact that they turned it into a love
story in the end. Give me a
break!  UGH!!!!!
