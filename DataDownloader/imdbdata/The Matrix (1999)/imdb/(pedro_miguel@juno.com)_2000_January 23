There were two major Sci-fi flicks this summer.  The Matrix and Star Wars:
1.  I can't really say which was better, that would be like comparing apples
and oranges.  Suffice to say, this movie is a ton of fun, and I wish I had
seen it in the theater.<br /><br />First there is the wardrobe.  Everyone gets these super-cool outfits.  It
makes sense that if you can program your appearance, you want to look your
best.  The downside is that the outfits seem kind of cheesy after a
while.<br /><br />The special effects were amazing.  They were effectively used to up the
excitement notch from what we're used to in an action film's fights.  You
actually feel Keanu Reeves is getting punched with tons of force (and
considering his questionable talent...maybe not too bad of a
thing).<br /><br />The plot was pretty good I have to admit.  Sure we've all heard the story of
dream vs. reality and being mere puppets, but The Matrix puts a great twist
to it.  Don't listen to people that say you have to see it 2 times to
understand it.  The plot is good, but certainly not complex or
deep.<br /><br />The acting was passable.  Fishburne did rather well.  Keanu did little more
than stare blankly, try to look pretty, and say &quot;whoa&quot;.  But its cool
watching him kick butt.  And Carrie Ann Moss....  If real hackers look that
good, then I'm a giraffe.
