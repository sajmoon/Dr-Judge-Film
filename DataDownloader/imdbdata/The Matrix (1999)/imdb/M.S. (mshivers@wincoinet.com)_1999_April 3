1999_April 3 

I just saw The Matrix last night. Okay, who needs to do drugs when there are
movies like this? It was a brilliant trippy rush to experience this movie. I
plan on seeing it again...soon. Solid cast, solid plot, and there is one
fight scene between Neo and Morpheus (training exercise) that makes the
entire running time of Mortal Kombat look like a K-Mart twenty-five cent
horsie ride. The TV trailers do it no justice.  See this movie! It'll make
you think.
