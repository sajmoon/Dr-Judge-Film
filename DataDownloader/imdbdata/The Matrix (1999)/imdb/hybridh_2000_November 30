Hmmmmm. Why see 'THE MATRIX'? You would probably want to see it because it
is quite possibly the BEST science fiction movie EVER!! Now you are
probably
saying: &quot;Why is 'THE MATRIX' one of the best science fiction movies ever?&quot;
Well, to put it simply: THE MATRIX has the best visual and special effects
ever to be used (rivaling even Star Wars), an awesome soundtrack, and some
really great acting. Keanu Reeves is at his best. Lawrence Fishbourne: the
name says it all. And Carrie-Anne Moss, a stunning as well as beautiful
actor.<br /><br />The fight scenes get a paragraph of their own. The best I've ever seen!
The
martial arts scenes make you salivate as you watch Neo (Keanu Reeves),
Morpheus (Lawrence Fishbourne), and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) whip up on
the bad guys.<br /><br />The plot, as I've seen, has no holes. I've seen THE MATRIX dozens of
times.
When I'm sitting around the house with nothing to do, I'll pop in THE
MATRIX, cuz I never get sick of it. Just yesterday, I was watching it, and
found something that I had earlier missed. Everything in the movie ties
into
each other. Every movement has a special place in the movie.<br /><br />Anyway, enough of my rambling. Go out and get a copy of THE MATRIX. You
won't be sorry.....
