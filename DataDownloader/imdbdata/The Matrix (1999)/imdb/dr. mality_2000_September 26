The Matrix is a movie where the pluses outweigh the minuses. Sure, I
can
think of some telling flaws here. For example, the whole MTV video look of
the film, with the characters dressed up in shiny leather and even shinier
shades,seemed to be a case of style in complete overdrive. Also, the
raging
gun battle at the end, complete with John Woo cliches galore, seemed to
undo
the very thoughtful first 2/3 of the film. And much like Woo's &quot;Hard
Boiled&quot;, the sheer amount of gunplay tended to be mind-numbing.
But that could not overcome the more positive aspects of the movie.
Like such seminal films as Metropolis, 2001 and Blade Runner, The Matrix
gives us an alternate way of perceiving our universe. It stimulates our
philosophical tastebuds and makes us question how we see reality. This is
not the only film to try this tack...in fact, I like &quot;Dark City&quot; even more
than &quot;The Matrix&quot;...but it seems to be the only one in recent times where
the full force of Hollywood technology and know-how is applied to the
concept.
There are also very few films which show you sights you have not
experienced before. This one did. Special effects are rated too highly
these
days, as character and story count for more in my book, but &quot;The Matrix&quot;
is
truly a movie where special effects enhance the whole experience. The
computer-augmented martial arts sequences are unlike anything I've ever
seen.Look for this type of effect to be run into the ground over the next
few
years but don't forget that &quot;The Matrix&quot; orginated it. As a fan of comic
books, I have never seen a true &quot;comic book&quot; type battle waged
convincingly
on the screen. Until I saw the final confrontation between Neo and Agent
Smith, that is. And the battle was TOTALLY believable.
There are some gaps in the film's logic and the zen-like
pronouncement
of Morpheus (excellent performance by Laurence Fishburne makes you believe
what he is saying no matter how vague it sounds) can seem trite, but &quot;The
Matrix&quot; is ultimately a breakthrough in science fiction movie making.
While
the likes of &quot;Stars Wars&quot; provides great escapist entertainment, &quot;The
Matrix&quot; gives you all that and a little bit more. I hope the sequels can
add
to the concept instead of debasing it.
