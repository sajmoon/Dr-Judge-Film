1999_June 3 
<br /><br />I say--without hyperbole--that &quot;The Matrix&quot; is the best action/sci-fi film
this year so far. Roger Ebert can kiss my proverbial a@#$! for not making
his review strong enough, because I was not convinced at the time. Of
course, the film has its flaws, which I will point out later, but
overriding
that is the film's complete ambush to the senses. I knew, for example,
that
once Trinity flew into the window of that building from the roof of
another
with such dazzling SFX accuracy, that I was going to enjoy the film with
or
without lousy acting.<br /><br />Although critically, the Wachowski brothers' previous film &quot;Bound&quot; is
wholly
of more merit, &quot;Matrix&quot; delivers for its genre. You simply check your
brain
at the door, let the deluge begin, and pick it back up when the lights go
up. Combining, to various degrees, good acting (many exceptions), intense
action, and a terrific sci-fi/fantasy story, &quot;The Matrix&quot; has secured a
place for itself among some of the more truly satisfying action/sci-fi
films, such as Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Blade Runner, Dark City, Total
Recall, GATTACA, Back to the Future, Star Wars Trilogy, X-files: Fight the
Future, Aliens, Men in Black, Eve of Destruction, The Puppet Masters, Star
Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn and so on. Moreover, although the special
effects
are key, there must be balance. One need only remember failures such as
Waterworld, Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, The Postman, Virus, Starship
Troopers (Sorry, I read the book), Lost in Space, Deep Rising, Johnny
Mnemonic, Vitruosity and so on to know this.<br /><br />The brilliant special effects and action sequences carry the film, but to
its detriment are cartoon characters, the trite (and almost comical)
aphorisms with Biblical overtones from Morpheus, the weak lead Keanu, a
truly promising story line that is never really fulfilled or elaborated
upon, i.e., there is no third act, and the film's clear avoidance of the
serious question that Cypher, Joe Pantaliano's character, raises. Aside
from
that, the effects and other elements work well to balance out these
flaws.<br /><br />The plot, although not completely original--see Dark City--is quite
surreal,
dark, pulpy, and most comic book-like. There are some literate allusions
to
Alice in Wonderland such as follow the white rabbit and through the
looking
glass, but also to the Bible. Neo, for instance, is a weak Christ-like
character whose name is an anagram for &quot;One.&quot; Morpheus rearranges into
&quot;Push
Rome&quot; and Agent Smith into &quot;I'm the Angst.&quot; And, characters with names
such
as Trinity and Apoc are obvious enough. In addition, the two worlds in the
film make a striking contrast. The wholly bleached, grim, and gothic city
seems almost idyllic when compared with the graphic and hellish &quot;real
world.&quot; Nonetheless, the Gestapo agents of the Matrix practically steal
the
show. Hugo Weaving's ominous portrayal of Agent Smith is outright superb
character acting. Last, but not least, Keanu's marital arts are
unintentionally hilarious. I know you laughed, come on
now.<br /><br />Yet, even after you combine this hodgepodge of elements, &quot;The Matrix&quot; will
still leave you thoroughly entertained--as much as any rollercoaster ride,
but for a lot less money.<br /><br />
