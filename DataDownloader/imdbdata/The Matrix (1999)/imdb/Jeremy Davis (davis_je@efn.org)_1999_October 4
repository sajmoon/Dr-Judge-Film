1999_October 4 

Awesome, unbelievable, incredible.<br /><br />This movie has a solid plot, mixed with stupendous music, to make it a
wonderful movie experience. I saw it twice in the theatres, and when it
came
out on video, I rented it, and brought it back 2 days late, because I
didn't
want to stop watching it. But the video store called, and asked for it
back.<br /><br />They left this movie WIDE open for a sequel, and I would love one. But of
course, we can't always get what we want (Unless someone has $10 million
to
spare, and a great director.)
