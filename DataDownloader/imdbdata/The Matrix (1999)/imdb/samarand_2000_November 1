The awe the subject of this movie inspired on audiences must be the proof
that nobody reads serious science-fiction anymore. If they did, they would
already be very familiar with the subject of virtual reality, including
virtual reality used to mask an unbearable truth. Also, they would have seen
it presented in a definitely more profound manner. If you think about it the
holes of the concept become evident, and the fact that our heroes are able
to manipulate the Matrix to a point does take a lot of bite from it.
However, I can't say I didn't enjoy this movie. Even if it isn't as highly
metaphysical as some people seem to believe, it is still a good action
movie, and, considering what passes for sci-fi in movies these days, it is
rather nice to see a movie that, even if it is not serious science-fiction,
at least more or less tries to resemble it.
