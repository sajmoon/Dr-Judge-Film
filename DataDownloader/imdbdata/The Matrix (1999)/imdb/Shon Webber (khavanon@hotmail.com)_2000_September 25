Of all the blockbuster movies that were shown last year (1999), I would
rate
this second only to Fight Club in overall appeal. Even as &quot;The Phantom
Menace&quot; entered into the summer, &quot;The Matrix&quot; was definitely the premier
Science-Fiction of the year, making up where &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; failed so
miserably. (Anyone that up-plays &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; over this movie is
jealous because everyone ragged on their &quot;precious, infallible Star Wars&quot;
and placed this one far ahead of it, which is rightfully so. Don't get me
wrong, I love Star Wars, but this movie is definitely better than Episode
One).<br /><br />There were at times some cheesy moments, most notably the romantic moment
between Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). Neo wasn't as
strong as one would hope our hero to be, but it can be understood that he
is
taking his situation in all at once, converted from just a simple
programmer/skilled hacker in the process of reorientating his entire
knowledge of things. To understand the movie of course, one would have
follow the advice of Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne), &quot;Unfortunately, nobody
can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for
yourself.&quot;<br /><br />The effects were excellent as well as the action sequences, not to mention
the plot concept had been very intriguing, original no less. It is
certainly
worth seeing for anyone who wants to think about new concepts afterward.
Anyone who thinks this was a terrible movie DOES NOT appreciate
Science-Fiction, and probably believes classic literature is the only kind
of literature. Let them watch &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; if they like and leave these
movies alone.
