..I reckon it&#x27;s aimed for a certain type of viewers.<br /><br />I love Action, Sci-fi, and so on; However, and believe me I have tried,
never found that greatness that many were on about after its release. <br /><br />Therefore, I just cannot get all the cult movement it created afterward
(black coats, tattoos, slang,...) For me it was a very original film,
nice fights (although the effects were not all that) and just average
interpretations from the cast with the exception of the always
effective Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith) and little more.<br /><br />I would not recommend it to those who do not have an open mind for
fantasy and Sci-fi.<br /><br />Hope this was useful!
