1999_April 8 

Many times I have seen movies where I see special effects and CGI
(Computer
Generated Images) and do not think much of it.  I think this is the first
movie where the special effects not only fit perfectly but take the movie
to
a new level.  The Matrix is one movie that has motivated me to see it in
the
theaters more than once.  I applaud the writers for coming up with the
awesome plot, and marvel at the creation that was made.  This is
definitely
a movie that is in my top Ten.
