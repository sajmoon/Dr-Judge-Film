1999_September 29 

I rented this movie last night on DVD. I sat down and watched it with
dolby's wonderful digital surround sound....WOW. The effects are amazing,
this movie belongs in the top 20 here at IMDB. The movie left me
wanting/hoping for more. I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes
sci-fi and action films. I will be watching this one again soon.
