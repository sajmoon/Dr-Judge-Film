The Matrix, while not doing much for my dislike of Keanu Reeves, redefines
what I think Hollywood should be churning out, and that's two hours of
&quot;Good
God this kicks butt!&quot;<br /><br />Keanu plays Mr. Anderson, a name used to taunt him throughout. He is being
shown what is real... and what is not...<br /><br />Look, see it yourself, I can't describe this one enough. Too many kick
butt
special effects, with excellent acting from Reeves and Fishburne... top
notch.
