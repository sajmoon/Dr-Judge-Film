The action plot of the Matrix was better than most, the action was great,
the special effects were great, the soundtrack was great and fit the action
and story, the sound was great.<br /><br />The first minutes with Trinity were among the best in action movie history
(WB stopped bothering the brothers about the days over schedule after sent
this segment).  Pay attention to the words of Anderson's boss which are
just
as prophetic as the Oracle's about Neo (and similar in phrasing to Agent
Smith's).<br /><br />Nevertheless, anybody who says this is a great SF movie knows nothing about
science fiction.  The background story Morpheus gives makes absolutely no
sense whatsoever.  The human body is an energy CONSUMER, not an energy
PRODUCER.  Friends of mine came up with a much better background story
(which makes use of the mysterious Zion), but if the brothers use something
like it, Morpheus must be revealed to have been misinformed.  There are a
number of other things about how they plug into the Matrix that don't make
a
lot of sense either.  Things work certain ways just because the brothers
wanted it to do so for the sake of the plot.<br /><br />So, a great action picture, but don't ever call it great SF.  Great SF
thinks through the science just as well as other pictures think through the
plot of the story.
