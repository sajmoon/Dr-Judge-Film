1999_May 23 

One of the more interesting sci-fi outing in recent years, The Matrix took
the best from all different genres, mix them all together and came up with
essentially a film which satisfies both the eye and the mind. Enough
things
to think about afterwards plus astounding visuals, a rare occurrence in
this
over-saturated genre...Today's so called auteurs should take note that
there
is a difference between homage and a straight rip- off...The Matrix is a
'homage'....films like Godzilla are a 'rip off'..
