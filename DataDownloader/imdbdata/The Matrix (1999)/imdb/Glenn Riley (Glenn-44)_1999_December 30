Released at the same time (ish) as Star Wars Episode 1, it was predicted
that the Sci Fi effects fest of star was would capture the imagination of
all people. But no - the real star of 1999, and the best Sci-Fi film of the
90's is The Matrix, a fast moving, heart stopping visual treat, which keeps
you on the edge of your seat. Buy the DVD, there are some great extras on
it.
Top film, and it's not a NO BRAINER
