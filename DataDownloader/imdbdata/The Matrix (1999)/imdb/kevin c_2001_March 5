Perhaps not as clever as it thinks, but &quot;The Matrix&quot; totally surprised me.
Am innovative, entertaining action film. The last 30 minutes reverts to
normal violent shoot-outs, but up until then the film holds it's own. I
won't mention the acting. It's all about the spectacle
really.<br /><br />I note some of the other reviewers took it seriously. Well calm down chaps,
it's only a film.
