&quot;The Matrix&quot; is a stunning achievement in both the science fiction genre as
well as visual effects.  The movie, visually, is simply without flaw.  The
&quot;bullet time&quot; photography, backgrounds, lighting, everything point to a
great time of care and effort.  <br /><br />Character wise, the movie fares just about as well, although I found
Lawrence Fishburn's Mephesto to be a bit overly dry.  Keanu Reeves returns
from exile to star as Neo, a programmer by day and hacker at night.  He is
suddenly drawn into a rebellion against the matrix, or what we know as the
world.  Little does he know that he is the one of prophecy, the one who will
set mankind free.<br /><br />Carrie-Anne Moss is wonderful in her role, its nice to see a strong female
lead who is both sexy and strong at the same time.  Her character of Trinity
is one of the strongest female role models currently on
film.<br /><br />Lawrence Fishburn plays Mephesto, the head of the resistance movement and
the one who finds Neo and brings him into the movement.  His acting is good,
but his presence is a bit dry.  He acts a bit overly serious, like he is
truly a messiah.  He doesnt detract from the movie at all, but I felt he
tended to overplay the role a bit.<br /><br />Supporting cast: an A....all strong characters and central to the storyline.
 Tank in particular, as he was the controller of travel between the &quot;real
world&quot; and the matrix.<br /><br />You might notice I havent talked much about what the matrix is...lets face
it, there are some of us out there who havent seen this yet, and its really
difficult to explain...I dont feel like ruining the &quot;surprise&quot; of the movie
for anyone.  Suffice it to say that this review doesnt really
exist..<br /><br />&quot;The Matrix&quot; is a spellbinding film...full of rich visuals and wonderful
characters.  Do yourself a favor and see this one soon<br /><br />4 1/2 out of 5
