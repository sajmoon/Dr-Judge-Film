1999_April 17 

This was a long movie - during which my opinon changed somewhat. I usually
try to avoid rating it until it is nearing completion - thinking about
what
could cause it to be rated one notch higher or lower between that point
and
the end. I just love statistics!<br /><br />Anyway, for much of it, I had decided that the essence of the movie
deserved
a 7 and the special effects deserved a 9. But, the last half hour of
Matrix
is so sensational and unbelievable (the effects 10+ and the story and
substance at least a strong 8), that I ultimately gave the movie a
9.<br /><br />This is the best special effects movie ever made without question! If ever
there was a movie to see at a big screen theater - this is it. Even those
(including the person I went with) who don't love the genre (cross between
Blade Runner, Aliens, and Terminator) will be mesmerized by the special
effects.<br /><br />I truly don't know what's next with special effects, however every few
years
I believe that I've seen a movie which moved them to a new level. And,
each
time, I can't imagine what more they can do. The exciting thing is that
they
will keep getting better - and I'll be there.
