I really liked this film. Great SFX, great fights, good strong characters
M&amp;F. I loved the look and the music.<br /><br />Blade + Johnny Mnemonic with a bit of 1984 thrown in<br /><br />BUT<br /><br />Why can't filmmakers think about consistency? Does the average bum on a seat
not care about the total lack of sense/logic in film. Is it really not
important for something to have internal consistency? Let's face it Star
Trek TNG managed to pretty logical for 9 years, 120 mins of film can't be
that hard.<br /><br />I won't ruin the plot for you but why would you grow humans as a power
source if you had to feed them on something which clearly could be a power
source and would increase your efficiency by 90%?<br /><br />Never mind - go and enjoy it
