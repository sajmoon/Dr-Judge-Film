1999_May 2 

OK, OK, the trailer sold this movie, but to have this monistic babble at
#18
spot of ALL the cinema?!! I give you that Matrix is better than
Arma-hehe-don or Starship Bloopers of last year but to seriously consider
this live action comics, where special effects barely leave time to
dreadful
rendering of cartoon guide to philosophy a bona fide movie is too
much.
