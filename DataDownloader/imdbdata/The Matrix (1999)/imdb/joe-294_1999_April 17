1999_April 17 

It's absurd that people are criticizing this movie for borrowing too
heavily
from sci-fi classics, modern philosophy, and martial arts action
thrillers.
Even Roger Ebert criticized the movie along these lines.  The fact that
the
Wachowski's were able to integrate those 3 &quot;genres&quot; into a mind gripping,
eye popping, heart pounding story is quite a feat in and of itself.
&quot;There
is nothing new under the sun&quot; so you might as well borrow from interesting
themes as opposed to mindless ones.  I hope Hollywood gets the message
that
people want to find a story underneath those million dollar effects.  It
does not have to be completely original just good.  Free your
mind...
