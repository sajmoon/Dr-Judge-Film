1999_April 15 

This movie is a must see for anyone who is a fan of the action and sci fi
genres.  I went after tons of my friends told me it was &quot;awesome&quot; and I
wasn't disappointed.  The effects - which LOOKED real - only added to the
development of the story, and like any good sci fi movie, man's relationship
with technology is one of the main themes of the movie.  The literary &amp;
mythological references were great &amp; the general plot and its underlying
theme about man's place in the world were solid.<br /><br />But let me say this - if you want to go to a movie that rocks, this movie is
a must see!  It's not just for the thinker, either.  It just plain rocks, or
as some of my friends would say &quot;It was tight.&quot;<br /><br />(And you'll never look at deja vu the same way again...)
