The Matrix is brilliant with it's 'in your face' action and subtle humour,
I
do believe that this is the Star Wars beater that nobody thought existed.
If I could have, I would have given it a rating of twenty stars.  The
fight
scenes were like poetry in motion and the effects rate a full ten on the
'Wow that's amazing' scale.
