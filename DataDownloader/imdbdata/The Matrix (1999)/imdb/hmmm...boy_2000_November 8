I thought this film was great, but only for the bullit time sequences. If it
wasn't for them, then it would have only have been average. The story was
good, but not original. (the future controlled by robots, where have we
heard that one before?)<br /><br />Its a great film for the visuals, I've seen more thoughtful films and it
isn't perfect, I think some things are overrated, I don't buy into this c**p
that it makes you question your existence and is the most intelligent film,
but I think that people who say its the worst film they've seen are just
coming down harsh on it because it was more impressive then Episode 1, or
because of the hype, don't believe the hype, go and see the film and make
your own mind up. Its just a really great action film
