I don't know if it can be any more obvious.  If you've read the story of
Christ and watched the matrix i don't understand how you can't see the
paralells.  You don't need to read between the lines, it's too obvious to
do
that.  There was even a scripture reference on the Nebudcudnezer ship.
Neo
was the chosen one just like Jesus and they were both chosen to save the
world.  Jesus died a painful death and rose again and afterwards had
supernatural powers. same with Neo, he had to give his life and then rise
again, and also should do things that he never could before.  When Neo was
being put into the real world, he went through the whole process of pretty
much being &quot;born again&quot; including the bald head and slimy goop allover
him.
He was born into a new life and a new realization just like when someone
becomes a Christian.
