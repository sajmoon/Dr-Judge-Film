1999_November 9 

  The best word to describe this movie is 'cool'.  While not especially
descriptive, it is hard to come up with another word to describe the thrill
ride you've just been on.<br /><br />  The plot has something to do with the Matrix, a computer-something-or-other.
 This film is really not about plot.  It is about visual techniques.  And
boy, does it fascinate.  The bullet photography and the fight scenes are
done incredibly well, the settings very stylish.<br /><br />  I will see this film again, and with try to understand more about the
&quot;plot&quot;, but the visuals make this film worth watching more than
once.
