1999_September 4 

In his recent letter my son asks me to send him VCD of &quot;The Matrix&quot;. As
usual, I open the IMDb.com to look what about. It was good thinks there. And
I decided first me to see a movie. Well, I had seen it. And I remembered, I
had seen a TV clip of it, too. But it is nothing to know of
this&#133;
You must look at that picture to understand what I will tell you now. First
at all, for me it was the speech and the all sound there. Fantastic! I not
remember movie with so clear though to be shown such sensitive to me, in the
last years. And the scenes&#133; It was magic to be in this obtrusive world of
fusing metal, flying glass, sticking mucus, breaking off brick's and
concrete walls, marble columns and transforming human and creature bodies,
listening to all this, like you yourself have got that needle drive deep in
your head. If you can go out of those heaps of cartridge-cases and globes of
fire, you should be kissed of a woman or a death. And what is more
important, you will never feel a fear or a depression to distress your, like
there is a short breath of safety life, prepared for you and your beloved
hero. Go, friend! Go to see where you leave, who are you now, and who you
can be, if some piece of human still stay with you! And call Wachowski-es &amp;
all the cast for thanks&#133;
