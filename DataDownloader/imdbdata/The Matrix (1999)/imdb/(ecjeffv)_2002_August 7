... how does Cypher get out of the Matrix after eating his steak
dinner?
Never figured that one out.  Just assumed he had some automated program
running while Tank was sleeping. Anybody have any other
ideas?<br /><br />Anyway, I'm amused by the people who rant and rave on how lousy this movie
was. It wasn't just the special effects that made the movie good, but a
very
interesting, very different plot. Kind of reminds me of Steven King's
people
living on the rose petal type of thing.<br /><br />I'm definitely not a movie fan of Kung Foo (Karate, etc.), and I avoid
similar fighting video games. But this type of fighting in this movie was
different and fun.<br /><br />Now if you want to talk about an overrated movie ... did you ever hear of
&quot;Citizen Kane&quot;? Don't get me started!
