We're still over here scratching our heads at how goofy ol' Kanoe(Keanu),
keeps getting really cool movies...like this one---he didn't have a whole
lot of lines in this one, so we agree he did play Neo like a pro! Even if
he
didn't, the rest of the cast, the storyline And definitely the effects,
made
up for it a thousand fold! I can't imagine there's anybody left who hasn't
seen it, but if you haven't---go! now! And make it snappy! Cuz you are
missing out on an extremely excellent flick!
