1999_April 23 

The Matrix is ideally suited to its target audience, 14-year-old boys.
Lots
of action and danger, little love interest, and a &quot;What is reality,
really?&quot;
theme.<br /><br />It has overt echoes of &quot;Alice&quot; (Was it all a dream?) and Oz (not in Kansas
any more: someone actually says &quot;Pay no attention...&quot;) but there's an echo
(Morpheus/Morbius) of Forbidden Planet and hence The Tempest, and of
course,
centrally, the gospels, with a Chosen One. Keanu Reeves is suitably
humble.<br /><br />I went for the special effects and was sometimes impressed (except for one
patently computerised wall of flame), but at its heart, the story is
flawed:
why return to an illusory world to save a real one? Once there,
ultra-violence is again the solution to all problems. Should we be
surprised
schoolboys go on rampages?<br /><br />A flub: reality should not shimmer in the real world.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving was suitably sinister: a cross between a young Jack Nicholson
and Richard Nixon. Laurence Fishburne was credible as John the
B^h^hMorpheus. Nice cameos from Rowan Witt as the boy who bends spoons and
Gloria Foster as the Oracle (I was expecting Whoopi G. and I wasn't far
wrong). It warmed my Kiwi heart to see a Maori name, Julian Arahanga
(Apoc),
in the credits.
