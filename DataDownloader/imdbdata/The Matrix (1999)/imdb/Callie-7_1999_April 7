This stylish, hip film is a must see for anyone who loves movies. The
Wachowski brothers deliver a tour-de-force of slick appeal which pays homage
to everything from &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; to &quot;The Terminator.&quot; Keanu Reeves
delivers a fine performance along the lines of his work in &quot;Speed.&quot;
Carrie-Anne Moss makes the perfect freedom fighter alongside him, and no-one
is cooler then Laurence Fishburne. The special effects are PHENOMENAL, the
soundtrack loud, but useful, and the amazing fight sequences are not to be
missed.<br /><br />
