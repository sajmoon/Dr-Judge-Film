1999_May 8 

I heard of this movie months before it came out, and thought it would be
another Sci-Fi flop. I was wrong. This movie just plain
rocks.<br /><br />1) Character development is limited to the main character, but I can
certainly live with that.<br /><br />2) Special FX are top of the line.<br /><br />3) Story may be unorigianl, but it is a classic plot that is told better
here than ever before.<br /><br />4) Cinematography is perfect. 'Nuff said.<br /><br />5) It's just cool!<br /><br />While it's not very origianl, it is done with a twist (a big one to be
honest) and I think it is possibly one of the best sci-fi films of all
time.
