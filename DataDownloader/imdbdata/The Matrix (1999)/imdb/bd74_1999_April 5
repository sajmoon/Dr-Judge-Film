1999_April 5 

I originally thought that this film was going to be yet another overrated
action flick with nothing more than action scenes and special effects to
make it interesting.  But I actually liked this film a lot, which is
interesting because I'm usually not impressed by action films.  There are
so
many words that can be used to describe this film.  Visually, this film
can
be described as a mixture of &quot;Dark City&quot;, &quot;Metropolis&quot;, a comic book, and
a
progressive music video, all with excellent action scenes, and some of the
most outstanding and innovative special effects ever seen.  The
cinematography is remarkable.  I liked the all-black clothes that the
group
of &quot;hackers&quot; wore.  I especially liked seeing the character named Switch
dressed in the white outfit while the others wore black--I thought it was
a
nice touch.  I'm placing this film on my list of best action films,
alongside &quot;Die Hard&quot; and &quot;Ronin&quot;.  I look forward to going to the theater
and seeing this film again, which is not something I do unless I consider
a
film to be really good.
