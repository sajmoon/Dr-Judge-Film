I am amazed about several things regarding many of the reviews posted about
this film.  The BIGGEST thing that amazes (but doesn't surprise me) is the
number of people who post comments about &quot;The Matrix&quot; being the &quot;best&quot;
science-fiction movie or even the the overall best movie ever made.  Many of
these people don't know much, if anything, about science fiction other that
what has been popular since Star Wars appeared on the scene.  How many of
them have ever seen &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; by Melies, the first &quot;science
fiction&quot; film made? How many have seen &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; or
&quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; from the 50s?  How many have seen &quot;A Boy and His Dog&quot;?
 &quot;Brazil&quot;?  &quot;The Quiet Earth&quot;? or any of the THOUSANDS of other science
fiction films, good and bad, that have been made in the last 100 years?  I
haven't even gotten into animated science fiction, which, as has already
been pointed out, &quot;The Matrix&quot; stole heavily from.  To those people, I ask
&quot;How many of you even really understand what science fiction
is?&quot;<br /><br />As for those who tout the &quot;deep philosophy&quot; of &quot;The Matrix&quot; or its being the
&quot;most philosophical&quot; science fiction film ever made, I would direct them to
&quot;The Quiet Earth&quot; from New Zealand in the 1980s, or Terry Gilliam's
&quot;Brazil&quot;... talk about philosophy in science fiction films!  What about &quot;The
Lathe of Heaven&quot;?  &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;? or, again, &quot;Dark City&quot; which asked
basically the same questions as &quot;The Matrix&quot; a year before &quot;The Matrix&quot;...
and which didn't go for the easy eye-candy effects which are what really (I
love the fact that, in &quot;Dark City&quot; where most any other movie would have
inserted the adrenalin pumping car chase, Proyas had a slow silent push boat
ride).  At least in &quot;Dark City&quot; the questions weren't overshadowed by the
effects.<br /><br />Last but not least, how can ANYONE expect to be listened to about their
pronouncements of the &quot;end all, be all&quot; qualities of any film that has not
passed the test of time?<br /><br />&quot;The Matrix&quot; was a good movie, it had great special effects and editing and
is a lot of fun to watch, but it is NOT the high point of science fiction
film-making... it is not even in the top 10, and might not make the top
100... but it was popular and I guess you can't expect much more from people
who think that popularity is what makes something great.  They are the very
&quot;followers&quot; who, if they were IN &quot;The Matrix&quot; would refuse to question the
reality they found themselves in.  They are the everyday nobodies who crowd
the sidewalks as the pass their lives in obscurity from the day the are born
to the day they die.  Come on people, learn to have an original thought and
think for yourselves.
