1999_April 10 

If you have to see two movies this year ('99), this would certainly be one
of them (the other, would be that small George Lucas project).
The Matrix is a high tech, gritty sci-fi thrill-ride of what could be
reality. Great fight scenes, incredible special FX (look for the awesome
&quot;bullet dodging scene&quot;), great performances from Reeves, Fishburne and Moss
and what has to be the greatest Hong Kong cinema-inspired shootout EVER make
The Matrix one of my all-time favorite films.
However, there are some faults, such as the flimsy plot (the background
story is excellent, and the following CGI vision, is well, scary, however),
just average script, &quot;tacked on&quot; romance, Weaving's &quot;not too bad&quot;-bad guy,
and the tackiness of Sydney's skyline (a city with more skyscrapers would've
been awesome, but too dangerous for the shot).
But these faults are minor, and don't detract too much from the film that is
THE MATRIX. Watch it.
NOW.
