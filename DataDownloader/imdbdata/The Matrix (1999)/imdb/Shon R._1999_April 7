1999_April 7 

This film delivers all that it promises.  What is the Matrix?  That is the
question the movie answers, and when it does it really surprises.<br /><br />The movie combines elements from the Terminator and  movies such as the
Truman Show or TV's Strange World.  Surprisingly, however derivative it
is,
it is a very well executed movie.  The acting is good, and the plot is
very
good.  In fact, the story line provoked discussion with friends about
living
a lie all the way home from the movie theater.  Of course, the FX are
fantastic, that goes without saying.<br /><br />Also, for an R rated movie, the Matrix has very little objectionable
material in it.  There isn't much cursing.  The only reason I can think of
for it's rating is the repeated shootings, and they aren't that
bloody.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie!  Go expecting some surprises!
