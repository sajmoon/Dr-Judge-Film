1999_April 13 

This film is as visualy stunning as Dark City, Metropolis, and yes even the
best film ever made, 2001. While it may not be as good as those films in
other ways it is still a great film. Keanu Reeves finaly proves to us that
it is possible for him to act and the Wachoski brothers who directed the
film prove that they are definitely directors to watch.
