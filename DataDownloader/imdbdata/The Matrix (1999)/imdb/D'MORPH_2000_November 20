2000_November 20 

SINCE there are over 2000 reviews on this film already, there is not much
more I can add, but....<br /><br />Special effects are the best I have ever seen. Keanu Reeves acting is his
best yet. The story and plot is fascinating.
Supporting cast are excellent. Action scenes are awesome!<br /><br />I have seen dozens of science fiction movies, very few of them have lived up
to my expectations. For example, check out the utter lousiness of Hollow Man
and Species 2! The Matrix is one of those few films I have really enjoyed
and given a 10/10.<br /><br />I am surprised to see so many reviewers comparing this film to Star Wars
Phantom Menace. That flick was dumbed down to suit pre-pubescent teeny
boppers, never mind adult audiences, with atrocities like (dare I say) Jar
Jar Binks and lame C.G.I!  The Matrix, however, is far superior to the
over-rated, over-hyped S.T.P.M. <br /><br />CONCLUSION: Mr Lucas should watch this film a few times to see how C.G.I
should really be employed to its best advantage in a movie. Darth Maul, eat
your heart out!<br /><br />
