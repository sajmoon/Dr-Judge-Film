1999_April 6 

This movie cheerfully borrows from damn near every action/adventure/sci-fi
genre in recent memory, and a fair sampling of recent video games to boot.
The plot is a tad too ambitious for the script -- for a movie that makes
so
much about obeying and/or bending the rules that govern reality, its own
rules are pretty shaky at times. But who cares? It's fun to watch, from
the
electro-insects to Keanu Reeves trading snap kicks in cyberspace with
Laurence Fishburne, to Carrie-Anne Moss' turn as the world's most
dangerous
leather freak. (Her opening sequence is one of the movie's
best.)<br /><br />
