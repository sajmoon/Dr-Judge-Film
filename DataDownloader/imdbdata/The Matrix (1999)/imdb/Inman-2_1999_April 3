1999_April 3 

I've never been a big fan of action movies, but the local reviews of this
movie convinced me to check it out.<br /><br />The fighting sequences, with the ultra-fast moves, still-frames, and
gravity-defying leaps, were among the best I've ever seen in a movie.  The
plot is based on the rehashed premise (&quot;What if this is all just a
dream?&quot;),
but there are enough original twists to make it interesting.  The several
action scenes easily outshined the rest of the movie, but the slower parts
of the movie were necessary for plot comprehension.  The occasional corny
one-liner or holes in the plot are not enough to take away from the
awe-inspiring special effects.<br /><br />Until now,I have never left a movie hoping that there will be a sequel
made.  Now I will give anything to see more &quot;Matrix&quot; action.
