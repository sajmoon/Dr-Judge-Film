1999_May 9 

I saw this movie last night. I was going to see two movies. The Mummy and
The Matrix. I saw The Mummy first. It was good but didn't please me as
much
as The Matrix did. I got out of The Mummy later than I thought I would and
missed about 25 minutes of The Matrix. I don't think it mattered. I loved
all I saw. It was such a wild and loud ride, at one point, I thought I WAS
living the movie. The effects were very good. The best I've seen. The plot
was a little confusing but still it's just the best ride to take. The
parts
that really look cool are the training parts. The martial-arts moves were
astonishing. I want to go see it again but not because I missed the
beginning. I loved the parts movie that I saw so much. If you want to just
be lost for 2 hours 15 minutes than take this ride. If you don't then take
this ride. This is a movie that everyone will love. What about Keanu
Reeves?
He CAN act. I thought he did a really great job in this movie. I don't
know
if Star Wars-Episode One: The Phantom Menace can be as good as this movie.
We'll have to wait and find out.
