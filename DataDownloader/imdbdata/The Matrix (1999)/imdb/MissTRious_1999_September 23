1999_September 23 

This was an awesome film.  I saw it twice and loved it more the second time.
The premise was original, the casting spot-on and the special effects
breath taking.  I must admit that if Star Wars had come up against this film
I feel Star Wars wouldn't have done so well at the box office.  Go and see
it on a large screen if possible or even on a small screen if you have
missed the cinema releases.  This film screams out to be experienced
!
