1999_July 2 

I'll be honest here, I had no interest in seeing The Matrix.  It was my
opinion that this was going to be a convoluted mumble jumble film.  I had
pre-conceived notions going into the film and I tried hard to stick with
them.  It is a strange thing really, because I try to like a film more
than
dislike, but I had such ( at the time ) an anti computer film attitude.  I
have always thought that computer films were the same.  But I am happy to
say that I was so wrong.  Man was I wrong.<br /><br />First let's get the comparisons out of the way.  The 13th Floor and The
Matrix have similar themes, but that is where the similarity stops.  I
don't
think the makers makers of either film copied each other.  After all, with
this subject matter, there is enough to easily make two different films.
Both films are excellent in their own right and as I said when I reviewed
The 13th Floor, the only reason that The Matrix did better business is
because it was marketed better.  And don't forget they seemed to copy a
previous film that came out earlier called Dark City.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves plays Neo.  In his other life, he is a computer hacker with a
seemingly normal job.  But he has inner demons.  There is a part of him
that
believes something is wrong with the world.  And then finally one day, he
is
given an ultimatum by a stranger.  He can learn all the secrets that he
believes are out there or he can stay in his drab life and never know the
truth.  What do you think he does?  Hmmm.<br /><br />He is taken into a world by a bunch of renegade freedom fighters led by
Lawrence Fishburne, who plays Morpheus.  And this is where I think the
strength of the film lies.  It is here that we learn what the Matrix is.
And of course I don't think anyone reviewing this film is going to give
away
what that is, but just saffice it to say that it will stay with you for a
while, especially if you are like me and occassionally question reality
every now and then.<br /><br />The true strength of this film is not just Reeves, but Fishburne.  I
remember seeing Fishburne in a little known film called Deep Cover.  I
thought he was outstanding in that film and I was convinced that was his
best work.  That is until the Matrix came out.  Here, he has a similar job
as Michael Biehn had in the original Terminator.  It was his job to
explain
to us, the audience, what was going on and how it was all possible.  And a
script like this is a delicate thing to handle.  There is so much
information that it would be easy for another writer and another director
(
fortunately they are the same here ) to give us a condensed version of
what
is in the film.  But they are brave enough and have confidence in their
material to tell it the way it should be told.  And for that I am so
thankful because it is really an intelligent story.<br /><br />So much has been made of the visuals in this film and I guess I would be
remiss if I didn't at least comment on them here as well.  They are
outstanding.  You will never see better stunts in any movie.  The
choreography is so perfect it really is like watching a perfectly executed
martial arts routine.  It flows so well that it makes you feel like you
are
there experiencing what is happening.  I don't think I will ever forget
some
of the fight scenes in this film.  They are sheer brilliance.<br /><br />But mostly what is enjoyable about The Matrix is the questions that it
asks
and how it answers them.  What is the Matrix?  Well, well I'm not going to
give it away.  As I said it is one of the parts of the movie that will
keep
you intrigued and will astonish you at the same time.  This is a very good
film and it's visionary outbursts are worth the price of a rental alone.
But it has a great story to it as well and that should be enough for
anyone
to want to see it.
