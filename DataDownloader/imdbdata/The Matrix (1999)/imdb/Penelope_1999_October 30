1999_October 30 

The Matrix had me cheering and nearly jumping out of my seat just as I had
done when I saw Terminator 2. Both movies frame the 1990's perfectly and
both deal with a possible future for man if he doesn't, in a sense, wake up
from the machine oriented reality he has fashioned for himself. Do you see
how wild The Matrix is? It has got me babbling on about reality and
machines!! Cool, man!!
