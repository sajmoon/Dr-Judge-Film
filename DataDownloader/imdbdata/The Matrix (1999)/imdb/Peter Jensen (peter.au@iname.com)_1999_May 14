The matrix is heavily influenced by a lot of other Sci-Fi films, most
notably such movies as Blade Runner and Johnny Mnemonic. There is also a
lot
of stuff you'll notice from other films, not least Star
Wars.
The Marix is a wonderful movie with a pretty straight forward plot, but
with
some AMAZING effects and a really good feel. The director and the cast are
superb in this movie, which could have been based on a William Gibson
book.
The Characters are very typical William Gibson characters and the level of
violence is typically Gibson as well.
All in all - go see it, if you enjoyed Johnny Mnemonic and/or Blade Runner
you're gonna love this.
