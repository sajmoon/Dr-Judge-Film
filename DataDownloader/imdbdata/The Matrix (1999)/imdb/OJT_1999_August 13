1999_August 13 
Just seen the Matrix for the 3rd time, and I can&#x27;t help still being
astonished! The first time was compelling - a shock. Knew I had to see
it again before the film was even over. The second time it was quite
different. Now EVERYTHING got clear, also what I couldn&#x27;t figure out
the first time. <br /><br />This third time I&#x27;m convinced! The plot has no holes. It&#x27;s a fantastic
story, the script is unpresidented in the story of sci-fi movies! It&#x27;s
all so logical, and when was a sci-fi just all logical!? <br /><br />The story is so good that the 2nd and 3rd coming from the Wachowski&#x27;s
can&#x27;t simply fail. Everyone need to know more about the Matrix, and how
the &#x22;neo Christ&#x22; in the 3rd episode will save the world - that is IF he
does! <br /><br />The special effects are awesome, and not ridiculous as in most sci-fi
movies. The players are great, the agents are great &#x22;machines&#x22;. The fun
with all the mysterious links and references are the spice of the film,
and the copying of lots of known movie scenes are so delicately done! <br /><br />My earlier sci-fi-best &#x22;Bladerunner&#x22; has not only been thrown second,
it&#x27;s almost been demolished!!! The Wachowski&#x27;s for president and vice
president. Neo for God! Matrix for 20 - let us just start believe
enough - let&#x27;s start knowing it!<br /><br />This film is just too good to be true - genius!
