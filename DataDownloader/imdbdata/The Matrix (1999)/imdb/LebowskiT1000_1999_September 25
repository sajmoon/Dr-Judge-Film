What can I say about &quot;The Matrix&quot;?  Well, I think I'll have to start
with...&quot;This is one of...if not the best movie I've ever seen.  The movie is
excellent from start to finish, I was never once bored, and one of the best
story lines I've ever encountered.  If you haven't seen this movie, you
really ought to.  The special effects are astounding and the acting is quite
good.  I give it a 10 out of 10.
