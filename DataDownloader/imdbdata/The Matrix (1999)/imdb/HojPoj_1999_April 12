The Matrix is an exciting movie with great special effects.  The premise
is
a good one, and for the most part was  achieved.  This movie could be
viewed
on a couple levels:  The action thrill ride, or on a more social
commentary
of society.  Either way you view this movie, the experience of watching it
is profound.<br /><br />
