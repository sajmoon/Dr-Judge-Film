1999_June 1 

This movie is the best combination of storyline and special efects I have
seen in a long time.  The only thing that was missing was true character
development.  It was so fast paced, it seemed like the whole movie took
place in a couple of real time days. Time only enough to get a glimpse of
each character. 2 1/2 hours seemed like 45 minute rollercoster ride. I am
looking foward to the sequels.
