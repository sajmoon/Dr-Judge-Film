1999_May 13 

When I got out of the chair at the end of the movie, the arm rests had
grip
marks in them.  I had an almost impossible time resisting the urge to
start
running up the walls or jumping across multiple aisles in the parking lot.
I had to make a cell call after I got to my car, and, as soon as my friend
picked up, blurted out &quot;Tank, I need an exit!  FAST!&quot;<br /><br />There's no way a page of comments could describe this movie.  Go see it.
Go
see it now.  If you've already seen it, go see it again.
