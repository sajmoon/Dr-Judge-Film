1999_April 4 

There is only one word in the English language that I feel can sum up the
impact The Matrix has on any viewer who beholds it: WOW!  This movie is
quite easily the most visually innovative film I've ever seen, a comic book
come to life, with sprawling digital landscapes, amazing digital creatures
and fight choreography that rivals anything Hong Kong can muster.  The
story, thankfully, keeps pace with the visuals, making the viewer think (a
feat which few Hollywood big-budgets accomplish).  Now I'm aware that many
people will compare this to Dark City, or maybe even City of Lost Children,
but this movie goes above and beyond anything those two films accomplished. 
Dark City was a great film, however it was plagued by it's MTV editing, not
allowing the viewer to take in the vast expanses of incredible set design. 
Thankfully The Wachowski Brothers don't go overboard on hyper-kinetic
editing, allowing us to intake the landscape.  And City of Lost Children,
although a visual delight, was slightly disappointing story-wise (btw, this
is not to say that I dislike either of the two films, all three of these
films are easily on my Top 10 list).  So, to make a long review short, The
Matrix accomplishes what it set out to do, which is enthrall.  See this film
if you truly want to see what Special FX and creativity are capable of
nowadays.  God, it's a great time to be alive!<br /><br />P.S. There is no spoon (see the movie and you'll understand).
