1999_November 4 

What is the Matrix? This film is the answer. The acting was so well thought
out. The special effects were top notch. I have to hand it to the Wachowski
brothers, they have a gold mine on their hands. The story was excellent and
the characters were laid out perfectly. The ending was not as shocking as i
thought it was going to be, but the ending was still really good.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with seeing this movie 3 0r 4 times. It is worth the
money. Enjoy, and<br /><br />The Matrix has you...
