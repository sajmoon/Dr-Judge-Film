It was truly bizarre seeing millions of stupid people who literally
disliked intellectual pursuits suddenly become enlightened geniuses
practically overnight...<br /><br />This film had an immense effect on the population and it should be
remembered for that, not for being a good film, which it is not.<br /><br />The plot: Let me see... Have you ever heard of a thing called history?
Yes, it is a bunch of things that have already happened ,things in
history are already &#x22;old hat&#x22;. This film takes one of the most basic
ideas from history, the idea that what we perceive as reality might not
actually be what we think it is. Yeah, that&#x27;s deep, right? Yes, kind of
deep but not too deep, we don&#x27;t want to scare anyone off now do we?
This film takes this idea and runs with it, it is the whole film,
without it it would just be a bunch of bondage enthusiasts running
around like weirdos. It takes something that is already a major clich&#xE9;
and beats it so hard into the ground that it comes out in China and
even they don&#x27;t want it because they practically invented it to begin
with! This old, yawn-inducing idea from ancient history is portrayed as
cutting edge thought that the Wankoffski brothers came up with because
they are mad geniuses and the whole aim of the film is to make the
viewer buy more of their films by making the viewer feel like an
intellectual.<br /><br />The acting: Have you ever seen what happens when people pat each other
on the back so much that nobody stops to say &#x22;Hey! Wait a minute, this
is ridiculous!&#x22;? Well that is what Hollywood is missing, that guy to
tell people where the line is drawn. This film is ridiculous, along
with the boring old &#x22;deep&#x22; plot (with aliens!!!) the actors are like a
bunch of coke-heads running around practically ejaculating on each
other the whole time. It is scary stuff but it is what millions of
people expect to see. Are these millions of people intelligent,
tasteful people? No, they are not but they are who this film is for.
The grunts, the social whores, the mind numbing dinner guest who only
talks about cars, the McDonald&#x27;s employee who HASN&#x27;T got a college
education... Nobody else could take this acting seriously.<br /><br />The special effects: Wow, when this film came out the effects were
amazing and even though it is void of any merit outside of the effects,
they should be remembered for being very impressive. It&#x27;s just a shame
that there wasn&#x27;t a single scene where these effects weren&#x27;t rammed
down your throat, making you choke on them. This could have been to
distract the feeble-minded from the other points above.<br /><br />Well, there&#x27;s my &#x22;review&#x22;, I loathe this film and I loathe even more
the pseudo-intellectuals it created out of millions of complete and
utter morons. How so many people can have so little to say and to say
it so loudly is just staggering... I give it 3/10.
