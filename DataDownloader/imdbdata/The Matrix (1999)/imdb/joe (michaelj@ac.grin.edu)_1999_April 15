1999_April 15 

The beginning is a little bit slow, but every minute of filming is necessary
in order to effectively build to a very strong climax.  The acting was by no
means superb, but it was very watchable, which is more than can be said for
some films out there!  The effects were amazing and the plot was just
excellent!  Scripting had a few minor problems, but the movie really wasn't
about the dialogue.  If you liked this, give their other movie, BOUND, a
try, too!
