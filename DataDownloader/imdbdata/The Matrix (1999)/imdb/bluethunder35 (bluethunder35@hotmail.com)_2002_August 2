2002_August 2 

After waiting three years after it's release to theaters, I finally got
around to renting the DVD of The Matrix, and now I wonder why I took so
long
to see it in the first place. This is a gem of a movie, and one of the
best
films in the last 5 years.<br /><br />What I love is that they took so many genres of film (action,
mystery/suspense, sci-fi, cyberpunk, kung fu, drama, horror) and
deliciously
mix them up into something that equals a hearty bowl of Minestrone soup,
gourmet pizza with the works, or homemade ice cream made with all the
ingredients you want. The story was intriguing; the idea that mankind
lives
in a computer-generated world while the real world is embattled in a fight
with computers to regain control of it for humans is something different.
Being able to be strapped into a machine and be taught any program
immediately and live and die in the world of 1999 is something I'd want to
experience myself. The SFX are again used to good use, to help the story,
not to hide the fact that the story is weak. Little touches, like Hugo
Weaving's Agent Smith, whose voice goes softer as he speaks his sentences
or
Joe Pantoliano's Cypher, who longs to live in 1999 permanently so he could
eat roast beef and not the sludge he consumes in 2199, are
terrific.<br /><br />The performances by Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss,
and
others are decent to good, although a little wooden at times, but
Weaving's
character is absolutely chilling, playing a remorseless villain. My only
gripe is that while the story is great, the actual scripted dialogue could
have used more bite, I think they were trying to get this one rated PG-13,
but the hammer-and-tong types at the MPAA rated this one R. Still, it was
a
huge success, and hopefully the upcoming sequels will be better than this,
although it will be hard to top this one.<br /><br />The DVD I rented contained commentary of the film, cast&amp; credit notes, and
a
long documentary about the making of &quot;The Matrix&quot;. Later editions have the
extra &quot;Follow The White Rabbit&quot; and &quot;Take The Red Pill&quot; features that show
alternative angles of the famous scenes from this film or SFX
documentaries.
