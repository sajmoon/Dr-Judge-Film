1999_April 19 

I've been a movie buff ever since I saw &quot;Aliens&quot; when I was twelve.  I
appreciate all genres and elements of film-making as  well.  In fact, I'm
working on shooting my first film right now.  I can straight out say, in all
honesty, that &quot;The Matrix&quot; was the best film I have ever seen.  Beautiful
cinematography and direction went well with a masterfully written script.
The acting was inspired and believable; the characters vibrant.  The action
was beyond entertainment in a way I've never seen before.  Sure, like all
movies, it had flaws, but would you rather whine over its flaws all day or
go see it again for the fourth time?
