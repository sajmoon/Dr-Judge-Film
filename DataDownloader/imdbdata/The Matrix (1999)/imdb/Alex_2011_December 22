This is the ultimate action movie. I mean it. It may be from the late
90s, but it&#x27;s hands-down classic. The title of my review says it all.
This film is absolutely amazing. Why? Here&#x27;s a few reasons. 1) The plot
is incredible. And there are several twists that I couldn&#x27;t ever
forget. 2) Although Reeves and Fishbourne are the main actors,
everybody in the acting crew did great. I didn&#x27;t see a single
unrealistic action or heard a single line that wouldn&#x27;t have been said
in real life. 3) The effects. That needs no explanation. Right in this
moment, I&#x27;m trying to think of things that weren&#x27;t very good in the
movie...let me think. Nope. Can&#x27;t think of much. Maybe it could&#x27;ve been
a little slower at the beginning, and had no explanation. But maybe
that&#x27;s what made this movie so great! Not only is this a classic in the
action genre, but in the sci-fi genre as well (although I consider it
mostly action). This is an absolute must-see.
