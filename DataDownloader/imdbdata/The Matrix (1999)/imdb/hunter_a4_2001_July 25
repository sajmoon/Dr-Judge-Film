The Matrix is one movie that is hard to get tired of. I have seen it
exactly
164 times and still love it!!!!! The pros of this movie are: Amazing
effects, really cool action, and an excellent soundtrack. The cons: Only
real action is at the end, at some points hard to understand. Other than
that, it is highly recommended.<br /><br />ps                  To the MPAA,<br /><br />What were you thinking when you rated this movie? Give it a PG-13 for
crying
out loud!
