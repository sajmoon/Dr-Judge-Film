This film is absolutely fantastic.  There isn't a single shot that is
lacking in perfection.  Every angle, every captivating scene carries with
it
a powerful sense of wisdom and spiritual enlightenment.  I commend each
and
every actor for working to bring forth such a beautiful performance.
Their
hard work and dedication to this project has paid off, without a doubt.
The
witty dialogue and nearly flawless storyline, the magnificently executed
fight scenes, the awe-inspiring implementation of the latest visual
effects
technology -- all of these elements join forces, blasting the minds of the
viewers with a powerful wake up call.  The world is YOURS.  The choice is
ALWAYS yours.  You will see exactly what you believe, for all of eternity.
Thank you, Larry and Andy Wachowski.
