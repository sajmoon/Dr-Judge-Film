Do you want a sci-fi film that will really make you think?
This film makes you work for it. A real brain teaser that will get you
asking 'what if?'. Probably one of the best films I've seen for complete
over-all perfection, great storyline, spectacular special effects, superb
choice of cast (not especially a fan of Reeves but worked well for this
role). Definitely a lead in a new direction of special effect filming.
Enjoy!
