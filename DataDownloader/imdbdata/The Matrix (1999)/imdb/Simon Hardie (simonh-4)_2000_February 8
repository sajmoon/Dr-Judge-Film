2000_February 8 

I watched this film for the second time last night and I still can't
believe
how so many people think this film has a great plot. You've got to be
joking
me.<br /><br />Let's take a little look at the idea of the computers using the humans as
an
energy source:<br /><br />1. Humans require fuel (food) and heat to survive. Where were the
computers
getting the energy required to keep the humans alive? Surely this wasn't
supposed to be from us as well?<br /><br />2. The computers had developed methods to 'harvest' humans. This ain't no
piece of cake.<br /><br />Instead of going to the trouble of developing all of the above *and* the
Matrix, don't you think it would have been so much easier just to have
killed all the humans and built a few power stations?<br /><br />One of the laws of physics tells us that you can't get more energy out of
a
system than you put in. The humans would be an energy drain rather than a
source. Someone forgot this rather important point.<br /><br />I'm not even going to go into the other problems 'cos I can't be bothered
typing that much, besides there's a 1000 word limit on this
comment.<br /><br />The production and visuals in the Matrix are really slick and there are
some
nice touches- deja vu, the Oracle and the vase, not to mention the martial
arts scenes with tongue planted firmly in cheek- but the plot really lets
this film down.<br /><br />Bet the sequel makes a mint anyway......
