The Matrix is truly a sci-fi great. For what it proposes to do for the
public, it is one of the best films made in quite a long
time.<br /><br />The special effects are great, the acting is quite strong, specially from
Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus, and the plot is entertaining.<br /><br />The ending is the only thing that lets the film down, denying it a rating
of
10/10.<br /><br />
