The Matrix is truly a work of science fiction genius.  It is one of the
most best movies I have ever seen.  It makes you question everything that
you know and hold sacred while making you apparent to flaws of human
society.  Also with all the hidden things in the movie, all the
connotations
to other things, and all the biblical similarities it is a movie that one
can watch over and over again and even study.  I dont think I have watched
The Matrix once and not found something new.  It is just simply a
masterpiece and work of pure genius
