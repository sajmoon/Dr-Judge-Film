What is the Matrix? A top-notch, balls to the wall, ingenious, visually
expansive and stunning, exquisitely crafted hard sci-fi film that also
happens to be exceptionally well made and very entertaining. Questions about
Keanu's acting chops aside, The Matrix is jammed with effects,
well-choreographed fight sequences, and some amazing acrobatics by Reeves,
Fishburne, and Moss. The plot is full of holes, naturally, and the dialogue
is typically lowbrow and terrible but who really cares? This is cerebral
popcorn at its most highly developed, a plate of eye candy lovingly
delivered with gasoline eyedrops.<br /><br />I liked it.<br /><br />Keanu plays Neo, a computer nerd whose life is turned upside down when he is
brought into the bizarre world of Trinity (Moss) and Morpheus (Fishburne).
He jumps into a classic mind-trip and has to sort out his situation. While
it would be very uncool to tell you what the Matrix is, understanding that
virtual worlds are involved helps immensely. Essentially, Keanu and crew can
bend their reality in one of the worlds but find themselves being chased by
computer-generated agents intent on keeping the secret of the Matrix intact
in the other.<br /><br />The power exhibited by the three main characters (Keanu, Lawrence, and
Carrie-Ann) is explosive and awe-inspiring. The trio of actors did most of
their own stunts and the results are striking. They trained for seven months
with martial arts experts and it absolutely pays off. With the addition of
some dead time cinematography and film speed tweakage, the fight scenes are
nothing short of beautiful.<br /><br />In fact, just about every inch of this flick could be framed and put on a
wall.<br /><br />The film does have a few faults though. You've got to decide whether the
lack of a well-constructed plot and sometimes silly dialogue will bother
you. Like Blade, this flick definitely chooses style over substance. Still,
it is light years ahead of some of Hollywood's normal drivel. There are
frequent moments when you start to poke holes in the plot but the filmmakers
quickly remedy that situation with another fight or effects scene. While the
film literally drips with Hong Kong-style wire acrobatics, it also has the
lovely all-encompassing darkness of Dark City.<br /><br />At the pub last night discussing this film with Gaz and Chen, we started
rattling off other action films that were nearly perfect: Die Hard, the
first Lethal Weapon, and much of Face/Off. While The Matrix is far from
perfect, it is certainly one of the more memorable flicks to come down the
action transom in years.
