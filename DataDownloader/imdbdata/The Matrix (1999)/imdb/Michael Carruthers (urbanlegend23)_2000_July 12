The first time I saw The Matrix, I thought, this movie sucks! But a few
months ago I took another look, and I loved it. It is certainly one of the
best films of last year, it takes sci-fi and action a place where no other
film has gone before. I actually hate science fiction films, but this one
had we enthralled, intrigued, entertained and amazed. This movie is one of
the best science fiction films this CENTURY has seen. <br /><br />I recommend you see The Matrix, it will entertain you and I don't think you
will ever see the world quite the same again. Free your mind, with this
incredible movie.
