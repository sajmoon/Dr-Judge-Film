&quot;The Matrix&quot; is a stunning adaptation of the cyberpunk genre.  If you
enjoyed Mel Gibson's novel &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, you will love this film.  On the
other hand, if you don't like Science Fiction film noir, and the science
fantasy aspects of most modern SF-based cinema turn you off, then you
probably won't enjoy it. If you plan to see it, see it at a theater with
an
excellent sound system.  Stadium seating is recommended.   While it will
make a good rental, the film will definitely lose something in the
transition to the television screen.<br /><br />The plot, while not anything to rave about, is a solid adaptation of the
good versus evil/savior type, with a good though at times slightly
predicable script.   Romance is minimal.  You know what will happen, but
you
are not sure at what point the various inevitable plot developments will
occur. If you have little experience with Science Fiction, expect to
become
completely lost at times during the film, especially during the parts
which
deal with subjective reality.  For older viewers with no Science Fiction
background, being dragged there by their kids or grandkids, go to a
different movie at the cineplex while they go watch &quot;The Matrix&quot;.  You'll
both be happier.<br /><br />The special effects are phenomenal, and contribute to the plot line
instead
of the plot being an excuse for them.  The sound track is excellent,
contributing to the overall atmosphere without being intrusive.  The
acting
is solid, and you identify with the protagonists. The villains provide the
appropriate tension to the film, and are appropriately developed.   While
nudity and sexuality are minimal, the film is incredibly violent.  For
parents concerned about this, they may want to give the film a pass.  More
mature adolescents should have no problems at all with this film.
