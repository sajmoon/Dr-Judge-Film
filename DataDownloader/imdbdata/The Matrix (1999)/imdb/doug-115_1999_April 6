Matrix was a unique blend of Sci-Fi and techno wonder.  The plot was
somewhat run of the mill.  Man of the future gets lazy and allows machines
to take over.  The plot, however, was fast paced and did have some
interesting twists.  This combined with almost three dimensional stop action
and slow motion film techniques, created truly unique film experience.  The
only negative was the one dimensional acting of the entire cast.  No Academy
Awards here, but still a new film experience that is sure to become a cult
classic.  The Wachowski's film is a pure joy and total
escapism.
