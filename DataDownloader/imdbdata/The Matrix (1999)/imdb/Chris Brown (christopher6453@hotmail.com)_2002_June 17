I realize that I'm going to take a lot of heat for saying this, but it needs
to be said; I really, really liked The Matrix, and I think it's quite
possibly PERFECT. The story was original, the special effects were great,
and for the first time I can remember, Keanu wasn't annoying.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves is Neo, a software technician/hacker. He feels something is
wrong with the world, but can't put a finger on it. When he meets the
mythical Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) he realizes that the life he is
leading isn't real. It's all just a game inside the Matrix. I don't want to
give away too much, but it's safe to say, nothing is what it seems in the
Matrix. <br /><br />Let's start with Keanu. Personally I think he's one of the most annoying
actors I've ever seen. As a person I like him, he seems nice enough in
interviews and the rest, but as an actor I think he's horrible. But here, he
doesn't have to speak much, and when he does, it's full of wonderment and
amazement, which is what he does best. He's mainly there to be a pretty face
and an action hero, and I think he pulls it off. Carrie Ann Moss is the
female of the film. If memory serves, she was in the ill-fated tv show,
Models Inc. She's come a long way since then. She handles herself well in
the middle of all this testosterone. And Fishburne is cool as always. He
wears these very cool shades and just has an aura about him. The rest of the
cast, lead by bad guy Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith does very well
also.
 
The story line was actually well built. At first I was afraid this would be
another one of those sci-fi films that looked good but didn't make any sense
(on a side note, am I the only person who didn't like Blade Runner?). But
here, the story starts off hard to follow, but it makes itself
understandable without making it obvious. The special effects were very
cool. You've seen a lot of them in previews and commercials, but they look
even better in context. Some of the battle scenes were amazing. And the look
of the film was done well. The world looked normal, but you could see that
something just wasn't right. The audience figured things out the same time
Neo did, which made it more interesting. The soundtrack was also good and
loud. Any movie that puts Rob Zombie into their soundtrack is tops in my
book. <br /><br />So while I realize that the grade I gave may be out of whack for true sci-fi
flicks, I really enjoyed The Matrix. I really didn't find much I didn't like
about it. There are several, and I mean several, mistakes such as visible
equipment and crew, and continuous errors, but upon first and even second
viewing they really weren't noticeable. Anyway, this was a very good, cool
movie, so watch it.
