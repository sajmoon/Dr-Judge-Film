1999_September 20 

I reluctantly went to see this movie (I was no fan of Keanu). Needless to
say I was overwhelmed...This is the only movie I've made multiple trips
back
to see (I'm embarrassed to say how many times). &quot;The Matrix&quot; is destined
for
cult movie Sci-Fi status. If you haven't seen it's ground-breaking effects
(no overdone Jar-Jar Stinks kiddie CG clown stuff here) RUN to your
nearest
DVD retailer.
