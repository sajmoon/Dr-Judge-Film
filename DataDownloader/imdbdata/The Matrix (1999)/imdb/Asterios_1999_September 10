1999_September 10 

Having heard so many things about this movie I was expecting something
good.But this movie was not just good.It was the best sci-fi movie I have
ever seen . Especially the parts with the fights were so good that I could
not believe my eyes that this was not Teken 3 on a playstation I was
watching.Also this movie projects some ideas about life that are quite
interesting.Do not wait to rent,go and see it now !
