When one watches this movie he/she must stop and think what a reality he
believes they live in!! Yea that`s right his whole life is a cybergenetic
creation. But now it`s time to turn the table on the enemy. Overall this
movie is very entertaining and well thought out, the Wachowski brothers
demonstrate a stroke of genius in this film. However their are a few things
i didn`t like about it, first being Keanu Reeves. I really don`t care for
his acting that much, he`s like the frankenstein of hollywood. He is so
&quot;stiff&quot; this guy doesn`t know the meaning of expression. He`s got the same
look on his face the whole movie. And what is with those guys with the
stupid sunglasses on?? Their like something out of a bad &quot;B&quot; movie. And last
if you don`t know much about computers or virtual reality this movie is hard
to follow. Other than the little things this movie is worth seeing, Despite
the poor acting from Reeves it`s still very good, thanks to the directors!!
rating (best of 5 stars) .....3 1/2.....
