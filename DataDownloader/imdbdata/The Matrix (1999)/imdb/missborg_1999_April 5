1999_April 5 

This was the most satisfying action/scifi movie I have seen in quite some
time. The few minor story/character flaws can't take away from the amazing
action sequences and beautiful look of the film. Keanu and Lawrence
Fishburne do an impressive job of imitating my favorite Kung Fu stars and
the soundtrack rocks!
