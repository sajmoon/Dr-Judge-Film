What am I supposed to say about this film?<br /><br />Pure and simple, it is a blast. It is about someone discovering his own
invincibility though he certainly doesn't feel invincible to start
with.<br /><br />It's about working out the definition of real - the character Cypher throws
us an interesting question<br /><br />With the real world now ruined, what exactly are the rebels fighting for
-and in all honesty with a straight choice between the 'real world' in this
film and the Matrix - how many of us would abandon the
Matrix?<br /><br />
