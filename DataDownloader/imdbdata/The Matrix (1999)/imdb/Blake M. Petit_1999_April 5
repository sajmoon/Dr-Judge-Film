To anyone who hasn't seen &quot;The Matrix&quot; who is thinking about it, I urge you,
go in completely cold. Don't allow yourself to know a THING about the plot
before you watch it, you'll lose the impact if you do. The special effects
are great, the action sequences are cool, and the acting is sharp. But to
really APPRECIATE &quot;The Matrix,&quot; you can't let yourself know what the story
is beforehand. The trailers for this movie are perfect -- they let you see
the eye candy without telling you what's going on: all you need to know
before you watch it. Just remember what Morpheus says in the trailer:
&quot;Nobody can be told what the Matrix is.&quot; Go in, watch it and prepare to get
blown away.
Keanu Reeves has come a VERY long way since his days as Ted Theodore
Logan. Between this, &quot;The Devil's Advocate&quot; and &quot;Speed,&quot; I think he's shown
that he is a major player in Hollywood. Laurence Fishburne is great as the
&quot;Jedi master&quot; character who's responsible for Keanu's transformation into a
hero, and Carrie-Anne Moss is not only cute, but capable of kicking some
serious butt in her own right.
If you go to the movies for action or special effects, check out &quot;The
Matrix.&quot; Warner Bros is finally starting to make good movies
again.
