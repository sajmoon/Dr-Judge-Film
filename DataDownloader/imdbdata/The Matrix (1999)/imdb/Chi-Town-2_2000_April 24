I'm stunned to see the people giving this movie bad reviews.  Who are they?
What do they like?  Where are they from?<br /><br />I've been around long enough to know a great ENTERTAINING movie when I see
one.  I'm 31 years old.  I saw the original Star Wars the day it opened, as
well as all the other ones on opening day.  I think The Godfather is the
greatest movie ever.  I think Sean Penn is brilliant.  I think &quot;Bottle
Rocket&quot; was extremely underrated.<br /><br />That said, I feel like I know a good flick when I see it.  This movie
simply
ROCKS!  I've never left a movie feeling both intellectually stimulated and
energetically charged like this.  It MUST be seen on the big screen, or a
great TV with good loud sound.  By the end I was ready to run out into
traffic and jump from car to car.  What a rush.<br /><br />So, if you have NOT seen this, give it a try.  Don't trust the reviews in
here that are negative.  See it with an open mind, pay close attention to
the story, and enjoy.  I've now seen it about 8 times, but the first time
is
always the best.<br /><br />
