Great special effects, with a great plot concept. Moss stands out as a
potential major star.  Opening scene proves she can be a robust, powerful,
sexual, female screen presence.  And as the plot works we get to see a
softer more committed side to her character although  it is difficult to
concieve that such a hard-core warrior could so commit to the Reeves
character so instantly.<br /><br />The rest of the cast also works, but the transformation in Reeves character
occurs way to fast.  He adapts to his new found reality almost instantly. A
reality that is almost too difficult to imagine, let alone adapt to in a
short time.<br /><br />This of course leads to the problems with the plot. Too many illogical
inconsistent things occur. Had it been spaced over the
period of time,  and had Reeves been given time to evolve into his character
it might have worked better.<br /><br />However given the plot concept, the great special effects, and the
prescence of Moss, it's an eight.
