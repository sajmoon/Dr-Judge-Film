1999_April 8 

When I first saw the trailer of this film, the movie looked very good.
I've seen it and what a movie. It has the most intelligent and good
screenplay I've seen. Nothing in the dialogues were useless. The special
effects were very amazing. For this time, Keanu Reeves did a very good
job.
The story of The Matrix is very complicated but that why it's so good.
Before, my best movie was Dark City but The Matrix is now by far my best
film. I gives it a big ***** out of ***** .
