The Matrix brings to life many questions that have been roaming the Earth
for a long time.  These include:  Why we are here, is there something more
to this life, are we truly the greatest race on earth, and more.  The movie
intertwines these questions into a plot that brings them to life and gives
them meaning.<br /><br />This is a very good movie and it puts a new twist on life!
