1999_October 4 

I saw the Matrix in the theatre and was so bored that I fell asleep for 10
minutes! So, just to be sure that I hadn't missed something significant, I
watched it again on DVD last night.<br /><br />I should have slept through it again.<br /><br />Sure, the special effects are out of this world, the mythology is
interesting, and the production values are superb. But the characters are
cardboard, the plot has thousands of holes, the dialogue is horrible, and
the casting director really needed to get a clue about casting; Keanu
Reeves?!? Come on! Didn't Johnny Moronic (excuse me, MNEMONIC) prove that
Keanu just doesn't fit into these cyberpunk leading roles?!?<br /><br />Anyway, I can not in good conscience recommend this &quot;film&quot; to anyone. It's
not a movie; it's a showcase of special effects.
