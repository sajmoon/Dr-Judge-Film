1999_April 30 

This movie is just outstanding.  Loaded with mind blowing special effects,
and an especially clever plot, I think we've finally found a serious role
that Keanu Reeves does well!  I saw this a week ago, and when it was
finished, I walked out wondering whether or not we humans are really just
part of a vast supercomputer program like the ones I saw in the film.
It's
very paranoid, and it's artificial world is reminiscent of &quot;The Truman
Show&quot;.  The only difference was that this world was digital.  Another
breakthrough with this film was that I was finally able to enjoy and
immerse
myself in a special effects film.  After F/X turds like &quot;Godzilla&quot; and
&quot;Independence Day&quot; came out, I tried like hell to avoid another special
effects bonanza.  But this time, I had fun, and the plot and characters
weren't stupid and unrealistic.<br /><br />Strangely enough, this film was widely attacked after the Columbine
incident.  I thought about it for a long time, and wondered why so many
people blame the media and the arts for people committing an act of
murder.
There is a difference between real life and movies, and you'd have to be a
real idiot to be influenced by what you observe.  Unfortunately, those two
students did commit murder, but you can't blame the movies for it.  I am
defending &quot;The Matrix&quot;, and many other films that people are blaming for
the
Columbine incident!<br /><br />Also, I would advise you not to stay away from this film because of the
Columbine incident.  If you're smart, you won't feel like killing someone
after watching this film, and will be able to appreciate this film for its
amazing plot and special effects.  I hope you agree with me on this
matter!
