1999_June 21 

After having seen this film for the second time around, I think that
although perhaps not as forceful, it was worth seeing again.
As some other reviewers have mentioned, the &quot;reality&quot; idea that the film
is
based on is not particularly new. However, I feel that this film should be
given credit as - for what is at face value just another Hollywood action
movie - it has brought many interesting ideas to a new
audience.
The film starts off very nicely - it doesn't assume the audience is
completely stupid and the full backdrop to the story is only revealed
after
you have already been hooked and reeled in by the intriguing events.
Although the films justification for the central premise is somewhat
tenuous
to say the least. There are also a few cheesier moments in some of the
action sequences which I think would have been better left out as at some
points you are uncertain as to whether or not you should be laughing at
them.
Apart from these admittedly minor grievances, I think the film is
extremely
well directed. The camerawork is excellent and the chases and gunfights
are
the best I have seen for a long time. The acting from Keanu Reeves is
competent, but not outstanding. What makes this film so good is that the
filler scenes are also extremely good - Hugo Weaving is brilliant as the
intimidating agent, and Laurence Fishburne puts in a good effort as
Morpheus.
The script is good although a little cliched at times, but then that's par
for the Hollywood course.
The film is in a similar vein to Twelve Monkeys, only with a more Blade
Runnery feel, and although I think that both of these films are ahead of
The
Matrix, anyone thinking of seeing an action or scifi film should
definitely
watch it - there hasn't been anything this good on in ages. It definitely
beats Existenz into a smoking pulp.
