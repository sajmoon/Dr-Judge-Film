1999_June 21 

I have - finally - just seen The Matrix, it took me quite a while to
persuade my wife to see it too, and let me sum up this way, I went to
watch
the movie, she went to look at Keanu Reeves, yet her comment when we left
the cinema was, &quot;it just won't leave you alone, will it&quot;.<br /><br />I will choose not to comment on the Special Effects, because as all know
they
are stupenduous. What I will comment on is the movie it
self.<br /><br />It is the kind of movie that won't leave you alone after you've seen it.
There are so many things in it that you look at when you see it the first
time and say &quot;Why did this/that happen here?&quot; and yet the explanation to
almost all comes sometime later. Thus seing it a second time gives you all
the more information, because you are prepared for the riddles, and are
thus
able to appreciate the movie better.<br /><br />The plot itself is rather thin, but that doesn't matter, as it is carried
nicely in the telling of the movie, The Messiah's personification is
perhaps
going a bit too far, and is in my mind one of the things that deduct from
the movie.<br /><br />Also the image of the &quot;Agents&quot;, the first time they are introduced, the
image that comes across reeks of &quot;Men in Black&quot; their clothes, and
sunglasses. This is a pity, because it makes it harder to take them
seriously. Something that they most definitely are.<br /><br />But apart from this, it is not the last time I have seen this movie, I'll
be
going back to the cinemas soon for a second time.<br /><br />A 9/10 for a great movie.
