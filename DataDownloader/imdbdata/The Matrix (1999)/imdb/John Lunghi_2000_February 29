The Blade Runner of the New Millennium. The Wachowski Brothers have crafted
an ingenious story line, and added some 'kick a**' special effects
intertwined with world class martial arts action. The result, is a dynamic
sci-fi joy ride, which ultimately reminds us of the blessing of life, and
what it means to be Free. Maybe not as ground breaking as Ridley Scott's
1982 Blade Runner but close. Certainly a Keeper.
