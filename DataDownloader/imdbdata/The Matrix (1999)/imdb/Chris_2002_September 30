While I was watching The Matrix, I noticed that there are some
similarities
that compare The Matrix to the Bible. One of the similarities that I
noticed
was Neo is raised from the dead just like Jesus was raised from dead.
Another similarity that I noticed was that in the end of the movie after
Neo
talks on the phone he flies up into the sky and then the movie is ended.
This can almost resemble when Jesus raised up from the dead and raises up
to
heaven.
