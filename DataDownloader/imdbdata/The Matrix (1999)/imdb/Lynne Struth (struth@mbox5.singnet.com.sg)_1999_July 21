I must admit that i watched this movie not expecting to like it, i expected
a movie with no story line and tons of special effects but that's not what
was delivered.<br /><br />This is a brilliant movie, with some brilliant acting, and although the
special effects do play a big part the plot can hold up on it's own. I
really enjoyed it!!
