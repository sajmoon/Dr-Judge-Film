Besides just being a stinkin' cool movie, The Matrix is a story of the
coming of the Messiah.  The film has references to many religions and
philosophies, both Western and Eastern.  That said, I believe The Matrix is
primarily a mixture of Judaism and Christian themes, used to make the
average moviegoer ponder his/her existence and reality.
	First let me explain why I consider this movie a story of the Jews.  All of
Jewish history is of their oppression and the anticipation of their Messiah.
 In the film we are presented a race held as slaves by a stronger force. 
Those who realize they are in bondage talk of the prophecy of the coming of
their Messiah.  This Messiah will be a warrior who will overcome the
oppressor.  There are also references to the city of Zion, a place of refuge
mentioned frequently in the Hebrew scriptures, and the ship is named
Nebuchadnezzar, a king of Jerusalem found in the Old Testament book of
Daniel.
	In a sense the movie follows also bears the influence of Christianity. 
Besides the obvious reference in the name Trinity (only Christians believe
in a triune God), they are some subtler hints as well.  When the camera
shows the Nebuchadnezzar's name plaque you may notice the reference to Mark
3:11.  This verse from the Christian scriptures reads, `Whenever the unclean
spirits saw him, they fell down before him and shouted, &#145;You are the Son of
God.'  This is an interesting allusion to the Messiah and his power over
evil forces which are hinted at during the film's final climax.  Of course
there is also Neo's death and resurrection which parallels that of Jesus'. <br /><br />	I also thought that this film was an interesting, though probably
unintentional, knock against Gnosticism.  Rather than transcending the
physical to be only a mind, the goal in the film is to realize that to be
truly living you must be more than just your thoughts.  You must a whole
person &#150; the body is as important as the mind.  
	It seems the Wachowski brothers gathered pieces from many sources to create
this fantastic work of cinematic art.  This is a film that will be examined
and speculated about for years to come.  I wait with baited breath for the
sequel.
