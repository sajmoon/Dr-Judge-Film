1999_April 11 

I went into this movie expecting &quot;good,&quot; and I was pleasantly surprised to
find that it was excellent!  Invigorating scenes left me breathless with
the
sleek set and costume design, flawless choreography, and deliciously
bad-a**
feel to the whole film.<br /><br />The story itself is wonderfully complex and there are very few loose ends
in
the background and plot, which are usually a big problem in sci-fi/action
movies.  The philosophy behind the story is well-expressed by Morpheus and
Trinity, and indeed fits nicely with the big picture.  In fact, there are
several parallels between the story and religious faith, but that is a
whole
other can of worms.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves is a stroke of casting genius as the rumpled,
fly-by-the-seat-of his-pants Neo, whose true purpose, identity, and
talents
are yet undiscovered until he is tapped by the Resistance.  He has only
recently begun to earn some of my respect with an excellent performance in
Devil's Advocate, and now the Matrix.  However, I am still rather scarred
from his &quot;Dracula&quot; farce.  Carrie-Anne Moss does quite well in this role;
a
nice change from her &quot;Models, Inc&quot; days, and a terrific showcase of her
chiseled features.  Laurence Fishburne is perfect as the omniscient,
eloquent and always-composed leader, Morpheus.<br /><br />Several instances of subtle comic relief were appreciated--the activated
sprinklers that drenched the agents as well as Keanu's Bruce Lee tribute
in
his fight with eerily articulate, 10-words-per-minute agent.<br /><br />Storyboards were put to good use, and the action was easy to follow
throughout the movie, even with all the trans-dimensional activity going
on.
Lighting in every shot was exceptional, conveying a sterile feel about the
whole environment. Sound design was also exceptional; it put the audience
amid
all the action on camera.  The soundtrack fits perfectly with the
film--the
silver bow on a beautiful package.<br /><br />Highly recommended, but not for the faint of heart. A terrific show with
an
intriguing and insightful plot.  This film gives you a lot to chew on well
after you've seen it.
