 &quot;The Matrix&quot; is that rare movie that exceeds expectations, and then some.
It is original, thought-provoking, great-looking, and constantly surprising.
It also is proving to be the most influential and widely-copied film since
&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. The writing and plotting are far superior to 99% of the
action movies out there, combining already familiar sci-fi elements (&quot;Star
Wars&quot;, &quot;Lawnmower Man&quot;, &quot;They Live&quot;) with Zen philosophy and martial-arts
mayhem. The zeitgeist of the millennial era is perfectly captured here,
exploiting the apprehension and bewilderment many people feel at the
overwhelming advance of technology, while celebrating the indomitability of
the human spirit. I only hope that the sequels can maintain the same level
of excellence. <br /><br />&quot;There is no spoon&quot;
