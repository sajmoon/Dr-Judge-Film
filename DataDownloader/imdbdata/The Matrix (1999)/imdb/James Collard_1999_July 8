The Matrix has to be one of the best films I have seen for a long time. It
is the first film that I have bothered to go and see at the cinema for a
long time. It is not just the stunning visual effects, but the casting,
the
acting, the directing, everything was spot on. The music also fit in as if
it had been made just for the film. The Wachowski Brothers should be next
on
the list for a knighthood.
