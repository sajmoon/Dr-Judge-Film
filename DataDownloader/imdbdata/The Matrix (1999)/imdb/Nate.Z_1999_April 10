1999_April 10 

Immediately upon seeing the first trailer for the movie, I thought that they
were showing us all of the cool parts, and that the &quot;No one can be told what
the Matrix is, They must see it for themselves&quot; line was just another ploy
to get you into the theatres.<br /><br />I never would have thought how right I was.<br /><br />While the movie was ambitious, truly, truly ambitious in what it wanted to
say, and with what it attempted in scope in action and plot. Ultimately it
fell flat. The action scenes were played out (can you say Jackie Chan?), the
SFX are tired and old (c'mon now, if GAP is doing something, it is
apparently a fad and no good), the plot was tired after Dark City, and the
acting was truly terrible. The only one to pull off a decent job was -gasp-
Keanu Reeves.<br /><br />And this isn't going to be a popular opinion. I was in the theatre and in
the car with my buddies after the movie. The audience ate this movie up...I
just can't figure out why...<br /><br />
