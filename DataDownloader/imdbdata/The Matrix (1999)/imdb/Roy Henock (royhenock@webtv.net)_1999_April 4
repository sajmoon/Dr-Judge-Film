1999_April 4 

This is a great action/sci-fi/  movie without a dull moment.<br /><br />When I saw the preview for this movie I thought &quot;Not another
special-effects movie, there isn't anything original left to do.&quot;
However, I was wrong. As Laurence Fishburne states in the movie &quot;No one can tell you what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.&quot;<br /><br />
