This is the most thought provoking and still exciting movie ever made!  So
much thought has gone into it's production that I find myself believing in
the Matrix.  It is so improbable, yet it could be true without us knowing!
Keanu Reeves at his best, with Laurence Fishburne &amp; Carrie-Anne Moss both
giving excellent performances as Morpheus &amp; Trinity.<br /><br />Well done to the Wachowski brothers!<br /><br />
