The Matrix is the best Sci-Fi Thriller of 1999 and possibly ever. Every
aspect of this film is unique. The graphics are incredible , and the plot
is
filled with suspense and really keeps you guessing.<br /><br />In order to truly appreciate the Matrix , one really needs to watch it
multiple times. After viewing it once , I was left wondering about many
parts of the film that have concepts that are difficult to grasp if you are
not really paying close attention. When you have seen this excellent movie
a
few times , you'll notice some symbolism and editing mistakes , it's really
quite interesting and surprising what you begin to notice. For instance ,
the parts of the movie that take place in the Matrix and not the real world
are filmed in green hues , and the art work in Mr.Anderson's office
building
are actually pictures of the matrix [well in its coded
form].
