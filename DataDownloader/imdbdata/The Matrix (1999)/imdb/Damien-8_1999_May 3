1999_May 3 

This is one of the best Sci-fi movies as well as one of the best overall
movies to come along in a long time. It actually made you think and had a
plot as well as great special effects and chemistry between the actor. In
a
time when creativity has hit a low point in favor of a sure money maker it
was very enjoyable to see this movie unfold.<br /><br />We can only hope that if there is a sequel as some people have hinted that
it will only be done if all the actors come back. The last thing we need
is
another Speed 2 on our hands.
