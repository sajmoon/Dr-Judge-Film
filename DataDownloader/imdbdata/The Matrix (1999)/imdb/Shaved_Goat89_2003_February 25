The Matrix is a great movie. It really makes you think. The fact that all
this couldn't be real. The writing is superb, and the special effects are
amazing. Bullet time impressed me and I thought it was really cool. Keanu
Reeves did a great job in this movie, same with Carrie-Anne Moss and
Laurence Fishburne. I am really looking forward to the nest to sequals. I
give this movie a 5/5. It is just one of those movies you shouldn't miss.
But, if you don't like movies where people are using guns, don't see it.
Yet, you would be missing out.
