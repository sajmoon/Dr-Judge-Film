**Please excuse me for some spelling mistakes** (no spoilers=))<br /><br />''The Matrix'' is not really what I've expected. Even though some brilliant
special effects, it was only towards the end of the movie that it got
exciting. The Wachowski-brothers has made a really wellmade movie, but
hornestly, John Woo does it better. Everything was better in ''Face/Off''
for example. Keanu Reeves is not one of the best actors in the world, and
this movie really tries to confuse us in a way that Terry Gilliam tried in
''Twelve Monkeys'' but it still ends up like an ordinary ''Bye Bye-Brain''
action movie. Only better made. If the brothers just made a more
entertaining script, this would be really good!<br /><br />Ending quote: ''The Matrix'' might not be as cool or good as I expected but
if you can hold on half of the movie you will enjoy! *** (of
5).
