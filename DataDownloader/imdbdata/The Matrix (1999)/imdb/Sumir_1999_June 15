1999_June 15 

From the moment I saw this movie, I knew it would bode well with American
audiences.I was wrong-they seemed to have been overwhelmed.
I thought it was a poor movie.This was supposed to be a cyber punk movie
of some sort but all it does is make a mockery of the genre. Let's face
it,any movie which stars Reeves will have problems getting acting
accolades.
The brothers had  the right idea for making a good flick since they had
their fingers on the pulse on what this generation of moviegoers want- a
movie replete with special effects, facetious dialogue and a plot and
characters without any kind of subtleties or nuances.They did succeed in
that respect and the movie did well in the box office.
This bodes bad for the almost near extinct movie goers like me whose
definition of entertainment seriously clashes with that of the norm.I pay
my
money to see some vestige of a plot which will me think, some characters
which will make me empathize with them and some decent dialogue which will
make me try to memorize them either to impress my friends by claiming them
to be my own or attach them to my email replies.Instead,all I got was a
movie where the only earth shattering decision made by the hero(can I even
call Reeves that?)was to choose between two pills of different
colours.Fascinating.
