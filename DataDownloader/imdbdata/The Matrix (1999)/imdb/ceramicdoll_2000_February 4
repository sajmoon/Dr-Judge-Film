2000_February 4 

The Matrix is the movie of my life,I have seen it for six times and I
memorize almost all of the script.The philosophy behind it was so
impressive,it was same with the subject of my &quot;philosophy of mind&quot; course
and I had already spent much time on thinking about it, and I had similar
beliefs about the real world and the world where we live,what I mean is
that
may be really we live in a dream world not same with the one in The Matrix
but a version of it,may be the ruler is not a machine but God, who knows!No
body can prove the existence of the physical world.Discovering that The
Matrix was about this subject was really excited me and it has increased
the
impression of the movie on me.So in my opinion seeing The Matrix only once
is really a loss, because each time I've discovered another aspect of it
and
enjoyed more.
And also Keanu Reeves' and Laurance Fishburne's performances were
perfect, especially Fishburne's, He was excellent,I admired his
talent.
The Matrix is unique,it fits no other category, it has created its own
category.
Finally, I am really sorry for those who don't know what The Matrix
is,
and unfortunately &quot;No one can be told what the matrix is, you have to see
it
for yourself&quot;
