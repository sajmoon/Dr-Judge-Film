1999_April 29 

I'm writing in defense of &quot;The Matrix&quot; which has taken a lot of heat after
the Columbine massacre.  This is not, really, a violent film.  It doesn't
prescribe or promote violence. It presents it in a larger context -- in
the
context of a revolutionary war.<br /><br />So, Keanu wears a black trenchcoat.  It's the next wave of cyberpunk, it's
cybergoth.  To focus on the violence, as many (including the usually
intelligent Michael Moore) have, is to miss the point entirely.  Like the
&quot;X-Files&quot; and even &quot;The Truman Show&quot; this film is successful because it
deals with a pretty important theme -- that we are not completely in
control
of our lives.  I find most conspiracy speculation good for nothing other
than amusement, but I do sense that a lot of people feel their lives
are being influenced by forces beyond them, and that creates tension and
ennui and sometimes makes people flip out, a la Columbine.<br /><br />So, if you want to prevent massacres, lay off the violence in &quot;the Matrix&quot;
and confront the movie's theme. If you can teach people to be creative and
free in their lives, then you won't have to contend with random
violence.
