1999_April 6 

Wow, This movie is awesome. I particularly like the long action scenes
that
included Neo kicking some butt martial arts style!! In fact , a little bit
of the fighting scenes reminded me of the old martial arts films that
featured Bruce Lee!! Like the thumbing of the nose, the slow motion of the
waving arms, a lot of it reminded me of Bruce.
I must add that this film is the turning point of what we will expect from
Hollywood because of its dynamic special effects. I have only seen these
effects of the stopping of time and the camera circling around the action
in a couple of commercials and I was waiting till a movie would include
these effects in their movie!! well, The Matrix has definitely used all of
those special effects..... Bravo!!!
