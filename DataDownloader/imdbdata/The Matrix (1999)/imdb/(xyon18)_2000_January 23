I think &quot;The Matrix&quot; is a movie that is perfect in all perspectives.  The
movie provides an unique storyline that matches the visual effects and
action.  The first time I saw the film, I had no idea what it was about
and
was completely blown away with its creativity.  This movie could probably
be
the best action movie of all time that predicts the future of film.  By
now
you probably know that I am an avid fan of &quot;The Matrix,&quot; but I guarantee
you
that you will not be disappointed if you see this movie.
