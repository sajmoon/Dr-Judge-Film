1999_December 15 

I guess i have to start up with the word WOW. Or maybe breathtaking is a
better word to describe this futuristic action/thriller. The story is
unique, the actors and actresses are unique and the special effects are more
than unique. A lot of hard work was put into the making of the film. Keanu,
and the others had to work closely with the maker of Jet Lee's &quot;Fist Of
Legend&quot; for about 4 months so that it would look like they could fight! That
is truly fantastic. I would like to participate in the next two Matrix
movie!!!! <br /><br />Thank you for making this movie:)
