When I went to the cinema and watched this movie, I thought that it would be
a good movie but that it was just a timekiller. As the movie had ended, I
just wanted to buy a new ticket and see it again. The cast in the movie is
perfect. Keanu Reeves is the perfect actor for Neo and so are the others. As
the movie starts, you don't know much of the world around Neo but later in
the movie you learn more and more. After just a few minutes, your trapped in
the movie and just can't stop watching.
