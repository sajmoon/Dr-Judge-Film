1999_September 26 

What a ride! Great visual effects, great special effects, and of course
GREAT action. Action movies changed from Terminator to Aliens, Aliens to
Terminator II, Terminator II to The Rock, The Rock to Blade, Blade to The
Matrix. Action movies are getting better as they go on and on. But I don't
want to say that this movie was perfect. The script, meaning its story
itself was a brilliant idea, but there were some problems. The Wachowski
brothers may have got inspired by some films, but this has too much rip
off
scenes.<br /><br />First when Keanu Reaves has one gun in each hand and shoots in slow
motion,
think about Face Off or Broken Arrow. What are the common things? 1. It
stars John Travolta 2. Directed by John Woo 3. Action movie 4. HAS A SCENE
WITH SOMEONE WITH A GUN IN EACH HAND WHILE THERE'S SLOW MOTION. Yes that's
right. They got inspired by John Woo.<br /><br />How about the second one? Many people don't know where the first scene
came
from. (Where Trinity is running away from those agents) It was pretty
similar from the first scene of Vertigo. Wow!<br /><br />The next one, you may call me stupid, but when Neo touches the mirror and
gets to see the real world for the first time, we can the special effects
from T2. (T-1000) James Cameron used this effect for the first time, but
the
Wachowski brothers are actually recycling it.<br /><br />The last one I saw was when after Neo and Trinity blows up the lobby and
sets the bomb, the way they go up when they tie theirselves with the
elevator chain and goes up, was a lot similar from Star Wars: A New Hope
when Luke and Leia(?) goes up. They say that Taratino was a total rip off,
but what about the Wachowski brothers.<br /><br />This movie isn't flawless but I'm not saying that this movie sux. I
actually
think this is the 2nd best film of 1999 so far. (Among The Blair Witch
Project) Lots of rip offs, but the Wachowski brothers combined these all
together perfectly. I give it 3 out of 5.
