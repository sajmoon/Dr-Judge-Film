Somewhere along the line, someone planning this film forgot to put in a
plot.  It's worse than &quot;Twister&quot; in that respect.  Ooh look at all our fancy
camera tricks and weapons and weird sci-fi stuff that really makes no sense.
 But it's loud!  And that makes a good film, you know.  And I would love,
just once in my life, to see Keanu Reeves not play a blank-faced doofus in
every movie he's made since &quot;Bill and Ted.&quot;<br /><br />In short, I absolutely and totally hated this film.  My fiance loves it and
watches it at least once a month, but I would rather clean out a cat box
every hour for the rest of my life than ever see this film
again.
