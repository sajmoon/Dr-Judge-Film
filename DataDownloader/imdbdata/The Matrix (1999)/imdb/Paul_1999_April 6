1999_April 6 

I'll start by saying what I think of this film. I loved it, it was
exactlly
what I expected from a sci-fi action film..unlike many other recently
released for example...The soldier, which stared Kurt Russel..but The
SOLDIER wasn't that bad...back to THE MATRIX...the special effects were
great, and so were the actors..<br /><br />Now this is what I liked about the special effects from the movie..I loved
the stop scenes in midair...and the monsters that attacked the ship(which
I
would have seen more of them).<br /><br />The actors were great. Reeves was the best in this film..and Fishbourne
with
this film might have moved him self up on the best actor charts..And the
movie also had a load of many other talented actors.<br /><br />And thats why I call THE MATRIX the best movie EVER. I gave this movie a
10.<br /><br />
