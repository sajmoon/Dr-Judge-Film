Incredible! One word among many that can describe this nearly perfect movie.
I am as avid of a movie goer as there is and have seen nearly 50 movies
this year with this one being the best by far.  Along with a perfect plot
and near flawless action scenes the acting fit this film absolutely perfect.
Well I do not know what else to say but this movie gets a big thumbs up, an
A-, and a 9 in my book. Excellent!!
