To all of you out there who think `The Matrix' is not so ever related to
the
Bible or perhaps they're just the same characters, let me tell you
something. This movie relates in so many ways that it's just insane. I
don't
know them all, but I know that there is a whole lot more out there then
all
that I will say, and I hope you'll try to realize that it actually is
relating and try and find more parallels between these two. First I think
that most people found this, that Neo represents Jesus, in more ways then
one of course. But I will agree that he doesn't fully all the way portray
Jesus. For one, Jesus didn't grow up and have to believe that He was the
one, the savior, He always knew, unlike Neo who had to believe it in
himself
to actually become the one. As well as Cypher, portraying Judas, in the
way
that they both betrayed the one that they followed. Morpheus too, as most
people know, represented John the Baptist; the agents represented demons
in
the way that they're both not humans but can take on human form; the
matrix
is the world in which we live in today; the `real world' is like the
truth
that Jesus and His disciples were sharing with the world; and the people
who
were born in the `real world' are sort of like Jesus' disciples.<br /><br />Although, the characters not only represent and symbolize the Bible,
there
are many more parallels through them. One I found would be when you have
the
choice to either take the red pill or the blue pill, in which you can
either
take the blue pill ( know the truth and suffer ) or the red pill ( know
the
truth and be saved). That just totally symbolizes on how in Christianity
we
are given the truth to know, but we have a choice, a choice to either
accept
the truth or not believe it and live a false life full of lies. I like
the
quote that Neo gives at the end of the movie: `I'm going to show them a
world without you, a world without rules and controls, without borders or
boundaries, a world where anything is possible. Where we go from there is
a
choice I leave to you.' That totally ties into the Christianity faith. We
indeed are given a choice, the choice to follow a life of truth, or
follow
the false life we are already living.
