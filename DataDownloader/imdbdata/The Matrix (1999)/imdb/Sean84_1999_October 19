First off, The Matrix was one of the better movies I have seen in a while.
The effects are amazing, and the premise of hope in a hopeless world is
inspiring.   If you haven't seen the movie yet, rent the widescreen version
if at all possible, and try to watch the movie on the largest screen
possible.<br /><br />That having been said, The Matrix in some ways is like Tron meets Wild
Palms.  And if you get down to it, most &quot;Technology replacing Man&quot; themes
comes from Mary Shelly's Frankenstein.<br /><br />
