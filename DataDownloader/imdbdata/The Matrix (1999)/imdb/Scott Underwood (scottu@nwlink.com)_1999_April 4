1999_April 4 

This movie HAS to be seen, especially by those of us who have been sickened
and dulled by the strain of slop-job sci-fi and action movies of these past
two years.  I can't think of a way to describe this film, other than IT GETS
INSIDE.  Two days after seeing The Matrix I am still philosophic about the
movie's premise.  The acting is convincing: a tour-de-force by Fishburn
especially.  It is blatant, presumptuous, and one of the best films I've
seen in years.  The Matrix stands upon a riveting storyline.  The special
effects and action sequences simply build upon this foundation to create an
absolutely spectacular film.  I'm buying the DVD for sure.
