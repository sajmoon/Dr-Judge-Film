&#x22;The Matrix&#x22; is the ultimate hackjob. Ironically, not only does this
film rip-off the Holy Bible, but goes so far as to NOT ONLY borrow sets
from &#x22;Dark City,&#x22; but also copies every major thematic element from the
much more original &#x22;Dark City.&#x22;<br /><br />In fact, as I recently re-watched &#x22;Transformers: The Movie,&#x22; which came
out in 1986, I couldn&#x27;t help but notice that the concept of the chosen
one was handled much better with the character of Hot Rod (Rodimus
Prime) than with the character of Thomas Anderson (Neo).
Coincidentally, both films also dealt with the thematic element of a
reluctant hero who rises up to become the savior of &#x22;the Matrix.&#x22;
Hmmm...it kind of makes you wonder, doesn&#x27;t it?<br /><br />I have to point out that I also see elements of Akira, Batman, Blade,
Bladerunner, Die Hard, Enter the Dragon, Fist of the Northstar, Ghost
in the Shell, Hard Boiled, Highlander, Rambo, The Six-Million Dollar
Man, Star Trek (any series, any movie), Supercop (plus a lot of other
Jackie Chan films..), The Terminator, T2, and Tron all rolled into a
hodge podge of a mess that just screams &#x22;HACKJOB!&#x22;<br /><br />Not only is this film a composite of much superior ( and much original)
works, but ironically, has also been copied to death by other films in
the past 3-years. &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; is nothing but marketing and hype. In
terms of art and substance, this film amounts to NOTHING.
