If John Woo and James Cameron (pre-Titanic) conspired to make a film, it
would likely look like this!  Noir-punk at it's finest!  The martial arts
and gunfights are strictly Hong Kong visual poetry.  The special effects and
action stars are in-your-face Hollywood.<br /><br />It is an interesting mix that has failed before because of the diluting
effect each genre has on the other.  (The Replacement Killers, Hard Target,
and The Corruptor come to mind.)  But The Matrix has the good sense to keep
the genres in their own sphere of expertise.  When it's a martial arts scene,
the action is pure Sonny Chiba or Sammo Hung.  When the special effects
occur the audience gets served a helping of eye-popping big-budget
CGI.<br /><br />The Matrix is sure to become a sci-fi favorite like Terminator 2, Predator,
or Blade Runner.<br /><br />
