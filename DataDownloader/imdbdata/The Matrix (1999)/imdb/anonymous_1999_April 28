1999_April 28 

I hate being a victim, but alas, a victim I became the moment I decided to
drag my girlfriend with me to see this film. I saw the enticing trailer, the
HBO behind the scenes special, and the rave reviews of many respected
critics, and said, &quot;I have to see this movie.&quot; Big mistake...
This film is absolutely dreadful, quite possibly the worst sci-fi motion
picture ever made, (even makes the first Star Trek look like a winner). Here
is what's wrong with &quot;The Matrix&quot;...<br /><br />1) All special effects window dressing and loud noise, not a single trace of
a story is present.<br /><br />2) Keanu Reeves (only action actor worse is Jean-Claude Van
Damme).<br /><br />3) Long, drawn-out monologues trying to explain what the hell is going on
when no one in the theater has a clue. This plot is so convoluted it makes
Kubrick's 2001 read like a kindergarten pop-up book.<br /><br />4) Too much John Wooesque artsy-fartsy stuff when this film doesn't merit
anything award winning.<br /><br />5) Keanu Reeves<br /><br />6) Impossible to even imagine any of this plausible to fill a plotline (I
know we must suspend disbelief, but come on now).<br /><br />7) Too many characters and not enough with character.<br /><br />8) The violence is way too gratuitous, especially in the wake of  Columbine.<br /><br />9) Extremely poor acting (with the exception of Moss).<br /><br />10) AND FINALLY.....Keanu Reeves.<br /><br />To summarize, don't fall for the hype, this movie is so bad, it makes
staying home to watch 90210 reruns a more appealing alternative on a Friday
night. In fact, I feel that WB owes me and my girlfriend $6.75
each.
