1999_April 5 

This movie has everything you'd want in an SF spectacular: a great story,
incredible special effects, and strong performances from Laurence Fishburne,
Keanu Reeves, and Carrie-Anne Moss (hubba hubba). The theater we watched it
in was packed to the gills, and everyone reacted to the film's polychromatic
emotional effects: funny, wired, violent, and with eye-popping
FX.
