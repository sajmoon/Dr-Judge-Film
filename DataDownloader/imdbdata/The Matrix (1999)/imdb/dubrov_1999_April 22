1999_April 22 

Possibly the most impressive film of Sci-Fi genre I've ever seen. Very nice
visual effects, good action scenes and a bit of humor are as good as a
pleasant story in which a thin border between dream and reality fades away
and our mind can fly into this wonderful world of Human fighting against the
machine.
