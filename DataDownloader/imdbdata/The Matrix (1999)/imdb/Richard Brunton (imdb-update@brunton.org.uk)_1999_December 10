1999_December 10 

A modern masterpiece, to coin a well overused phrase, but not out of place
with this movie.<br /><br />This film has one of those unique qualities that so few films have, it makes
you leave the cinema with a feeling of sheer excitement, you feel ready to
take on anything and you could, if only the Matrix were
real!<br /><br />With amazing special effects, created months prior to scenes being shot, and
looking extremely stylish, it delivers everything that you'd expect, and
more, an interesting plot. Yes, there is a plot, and although it's way out
there, I couldn't help but overlook the far fetched ideas and leap headlong
into the Matrix. It challenges all our beliefs about our way of life, and by
the end of the film you can almost argue yourself into thinking it could all
be true!<br /><br />Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss are fantastic, whereas Keanu Reeves
is just his usual bewildered character - although in this film it works
perfectly. Hugo Weaving, as Agent Smith, is superb, a fantastic love-to-hate
character. The way he and Fishburne talk and act throughout this film is
just pure cool - I found myself imitating them continuously
afterwards.<br /><br />Go see this film, or rent it on DVD. Only word of advice though is make sure
you watch it with Digital soundtrack and surround speakers - it'll blow you
away.
