1999_April 23 

The thing I still don't understand is how so many people like this movie
enough to give it a 10.  The dialogue was corny to the point where I
literally laughed out loud more than once.  The acting was ok, except for
Fishburne which is disappointing because I loved him in his other movies.
Of course, with lines like his, its hard to pull it off without sounding
cheesy.  The concept was great, and the story unfolded with pretty good
execution.  But this is an effects movie pure and simple.  When you're
watching a movie, and you can pinpoint exact scenes stolen from other
movies, there's a problem.  All the action sequences were bit off John Woo
and Mortal Kombat, the love story was ripped from Far and Away, and Neo's
triumph at the end, &quot;My name... is Neo&quot; is from Roots.  GIVE ME A BREAK!!
Is
it not enough to pile on the cheese, but you have to rip other movies off
so
blatantly? I don't recommend this movie at all.
