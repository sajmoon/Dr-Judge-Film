1999_September 18 

I have not been able to say this about a film for a long time, but The
Matrix (1999) is a wonderful film.  From the first frame of film to the last
scene where Reeves flies upwards into the sky you will find your self
hooked.<br /><br />Every minute seems to bring a new revelation as Neo (Reeves) is plunged
head-first (literally at one point) into the real world.  Other reviewers
have compared The Matrix with Alice in Wonderland, and this analogy couldn't
be more true.  Reeves plays the Alice charactor admirably well; as he
discovers, in the most stylish way possible, that the world is not all it
seems and that mankind is nothing more than a living battery to power our
future computer controlled nemesis.<br /><br />The scary thing is that this could all be true.  The world as we know it
could be nothing more than an illusion to keep us under control.  An
excellent supporting cast of Carrie-Anne Moss and Laurence Fishburne help
make the illusion seem real.  All in all a fantastic movie, the highlight of
the year.
