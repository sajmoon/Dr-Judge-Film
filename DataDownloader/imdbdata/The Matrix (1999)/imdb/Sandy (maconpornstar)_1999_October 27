1999_October 27 

This is by far my favorite movie of the year.  I have seen it six times
(twice in the theater) and it got better each time.  One thing that makes
this movie so great is it appeals to people on every level.  It has the
themes of love, action, and science fiction.  It is also great to watch for
the cinematic reasons.  My brother-in-law did not understand the movie but
he loved it just for the action sequences.  My sister enjoyed seeing Keanu
Reeves .
