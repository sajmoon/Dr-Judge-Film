1999_April 5 

I have seen this film 3 times in 3 days and I'm in awe each time. The
Japanimation style the directors were shooting for came across brilliantly.
The best visual effect is the still rotations that I just couldn't get
enough of.<br /><br />This film goes from mystery to confusion to despair to amazement and all the
time keeps your blood racing with intense VFX and action sequences. It's
also about time a late 90s film had a compelling plot.<br /><br />This movie is like Dark City meets Hackers meets Ghost in the Shell. It
keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. If you like action,
sci-fi, or just any well-done movie, this one is a must-see.
