I doubt anyone will get to see this since my comment is number 2000 or
something like that, but after reading several comments, I had to write
something.<br /><br />When watching &quot;The Matrix,&quot; you MUST remember everything is a computer
program.  EVERYTHING in the Matrix is computer programming.<br /><br />I am curious, several people mentioned huge holes in the plot...what are
these holes exactly?  Keeping in mind that everything is a computer
program,
what are these holes?<br /><br />Regarding the fact that &quot;love&quot; saved the day, I agree that it was a tacky
label, but they could have named that bit of code that allowed Neo to beat
the matrix anything.  Since this is a movie, they chose &quot;love.&quot;  However,
they could have used any name for the code, &quot;pizza&quot; could have been what
saved Neo, the name for the code is a moot point.<br /><br />I still would love to hear about these holes in the plot...<br /><br />
