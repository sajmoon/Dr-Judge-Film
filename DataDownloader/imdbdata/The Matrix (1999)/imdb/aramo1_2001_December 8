2001_December 8 

Based on R2 DVD 131 min<br /><br />Obviously I'm a sap for the combination of ideas and images that go into the
making of the Matrix. If the black wet look, computers, hackers and wapping
great conspiracy theories are your thing then you're going love this movie.
Agent Smith deserves a special mention for his line delivery.<br /><br />The movie glosses over a few points e.g. (1) exactly how out heros get in
and out of the Matrix (2) when Agent Smith cracks up what happened the
original host - none of it matters :)<br /><br />I now look out for Reeves, Fishburne, Pantoliano and Moss in just about any
movie - so far I've not been disappointed.<br /><br />8/10
