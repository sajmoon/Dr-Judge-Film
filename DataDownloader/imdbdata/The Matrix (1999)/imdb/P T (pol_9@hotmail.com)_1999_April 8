1999_April 8 

The Matrix blows away everything before it in terms of VFX with the new
technology.  I have watched it 3 times personally, with plans for more, and
have convinced 38 people to go as well, all of which have demanded to go
again.  The eerie mood of the Matrix builds upon its frenzied action/fight
sequences.  This movie is a must, and makes up for Keanu Reeves' past slips.
Where these men have created an impressive movie, their technology may be
overly used in future films.
