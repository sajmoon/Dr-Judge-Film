Brilliant! A film that deals with the nature of reality, that questions
what
is real, not what we feel that is real but the very concept of real,
brings
this discussion to another level. Every time you're getting involved with
the story, the Brothers remind you that it is just a film by putting
onscreen a rereading of a scene you've seen before in another
film.
The amount of intertextuality found on &quot;The Matrix&quot;  is little from
unbelievable. Is even difficult to follow all the citations. John Ford,
John
Woo, Bruce Lee, Dirty Harry, Superman... can you really identify them
all?
If you know nothing about films, you'll love it. If you know a lot,
prepare
yourself for a unique experience!
