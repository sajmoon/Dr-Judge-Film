Ultimately, this film will prove to have been notable for its style.  For
people accustomed to watching movies which require thought, it's fairly
simplistic, and yes, dull... though it would probably hard to find anyone
who wouldn't contend it certainly has its moments.  A rare credible
performance by Keanu, Larry Fishburne fine as usual, the martial arts stuff
is truly breathtaking.  A good idea, they could have done so much more with
it.
