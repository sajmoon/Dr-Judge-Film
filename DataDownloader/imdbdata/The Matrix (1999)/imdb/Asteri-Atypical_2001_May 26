Certainly this film was interesting and groundbreaking.<br /><br />The effects broke new ground.  What made this film also unique in this era
was not only the look and feel, but there was actually an INTERESTING
CONCEPT behind it!  Wow!  A 90's film that wasn't brain dead! <br /><br />Most action films are so stupid they are pathetic.  While this film was not
literary genius, it was a good plot and a great concept.  Unheard of in an
ACTION film.  The concept also was such that it allowed for the suspension
of logic in the action.  Instead of stupidly ignoring science and physics,
this film said &quot;none of this is real&quot;!  What better venue in which to create
a surreal world?<br /><br />While the cocept was almost brilliant and the plot was reasonably well
developed, I wish the writers had gone just a little farther with the
intelligent potential this concept offered.  It was still a little &quot;dumbed
down&quot;; just not as much as most movies today.  If this film had added a
little more time and expanded on the concepts, plus added a higher education
level to the dialogue, it could have been one of the greats of all
time.<br /><br />Still, this movie remains a rare breath of fresh air in a world of otherwise
hackneyed plots and trite dialogue.
