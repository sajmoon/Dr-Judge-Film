You don't want to leave your seat during this movie. Going in to it I
figured that if nothing else, the effects would make for some good eye
candy. And it does, but there is also a captivating story that goes with it
to that makes this movie worthwhile entertainment, rather than it being
&quot;Johnny Mnemonic: Part 2&quot;
