This has to be one of the most original movies ever made. The completely
believable plot combined with superhuman abilities makes for a dazzling
display of martial arts and high-tech wizardry. And I cannot stress how
ingenious this movie is to first display all these things that look
effortlessly slick, and then make you believe it's possible for you to do
them too. This movie focuses on the premise that we aren't in the reality we
think we are; that there is something evil and malevolent lurking beyond our
senses. And, I say again, it is completely believable and rational in its
approach. If you want a movie that will thoroughly entertain you and at the
same time, easily disconnect your from reality, WATCH THIS
FILM.
