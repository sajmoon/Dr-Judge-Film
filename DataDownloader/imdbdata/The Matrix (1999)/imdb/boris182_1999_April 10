Wow.  The Matrix does use the same standard plot of most sci/fi films of
the
past, but the way it's carried out is exceptional.
Camera angles are outstanding.  Inredible combination of kick-a** martial
arts with plenty of mini-guns as well.  Effects are simply amazing.  Even
the soundtrack rocks.  Nobody should see this film less than 3
times!
