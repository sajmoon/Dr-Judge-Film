I have to agree that the Matrix does have great FX. But, I don't believe
that that alone makes a great movie. i think that the story lacked a strong
believable plot line,and had weak, unidentifiable charaters. So if we were
to
strip the Matrix, of all the speical fx, there would be nothing left. But,
that's just my opinion and I could be wrong.
