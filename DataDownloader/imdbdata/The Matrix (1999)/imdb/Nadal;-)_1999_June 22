1999_June 22 

keanu reeves is the one, and i'm telling you that this film is the one.
Just
imagine combing the best gun fights with good kung fu and a gripping plot,
and you have the matrix in a nut shell.
the film is made by the most amazing special effects you'll witness for a
long time, and it is these that make the gun fights seem in a class of
their
own. For those in the know, you'll be happy to hear that for raw creative
inspiration, john woo still has better gun fights, but it is only through
the
massive budget and presence of computer generated special effects that the
matrix seems to have better gun fights.<br /><br />this is the best film ever
