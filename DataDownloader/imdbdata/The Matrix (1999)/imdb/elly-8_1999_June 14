1999_June 14 

Go to the cinema now and see this film. Don't wait for video, it won't be
as
good on the small screen. Any film where you suddenly realise you've got
all
your muscles tensed, just in case, is good in my book. The effects were
marvellous, the direction superb, the camera work amazing, the script was
in
the most part very good and the acting was excellent. Even the notoriously
wooden Keanu did well. I seriously thought about buying a ticket for the
next show after I came out of the one I saw. Remember, there is no
spoon.
