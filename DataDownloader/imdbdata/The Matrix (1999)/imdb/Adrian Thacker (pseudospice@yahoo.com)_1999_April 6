1999_April 6 

I was basically dragged into this movie kicking and screaming. Complaining
about wasting money on my ticket. The woman beside me said &quot;You'll like
it,
I saw it this afternoon, and I'm going again&quot;. I said &quot;I hate most Sci-Fi
movies, and I can't stand Keanu Reeves&quot;. She said &quot;You'll like it
anyways&quot;.
Who would've thought she'd be right?!? This movie was stupendous. Keanu
was
actually decent in this one! The story was complex, but at the same time,
easy to follow...the characters were likeable, or hateable, whichever they
were meant to be. The special effects were wonderful - such eye-candy...I
would definitely recommend this one to people. 9/10.
