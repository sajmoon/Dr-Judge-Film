There are many choices to have under as action film of the 90's, horror film
of the 90's, even martial arts film of the 90's. But throughout the decade
the sci-fi film that no one could touch was T2. No other sci-fi film was so
revolutionary, and no other sci-fi film was as effective on the way
Hollywood did special effects. Until 1999, when The Matrix came
out.<br /><br />Not only did it have a plot that makes you think, it mixes beautiful
cinematography with grade-A martial arts, Die Hard style stunts, and makes
black trenchcoats cool.<br /><br />The acting and dialouge in the film is as good as it gets for a sci-fi film.
All of the characters had a sort of calm motion to them all. This worked
best with Agent Smith and Morpheus, who pulled it off like it was
nothing.<br /><br />Of course the main hype behind the film is the &quot;bullet time&quot; effect, but
there are other things to put into thought when thinking of renting this
movie. Keanu Reeves and Lawrence Fishburne put in 6 months of martial arts
training to do their fight scenes, and the shoot-out scene in the lobby took
6 weeks of filming. In other words, this film took a lot of effort and it
shows.<br /><br />I definately recommend this movie.
