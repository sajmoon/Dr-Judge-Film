2000_February 20 

        I have to be honest and say that when this movie came out in
the
theatres, I had absolutely no interest in seeing it. And a big part of
it
was because of Keanu Reeves. But I kept hearing how wonderful this movie
was
and this was at about the same time when Star Wars: The Phantom Menace
came
out. Now mind you, Star Wars wasn't that great either but the
hype
surrounding that movie promised, at the very least, an entertaining time.
I
recently had a conversation about movies with my sister and her
boyfriend
and when they found out I still hadn't seen this movie, I was
soundly
chastised for it and was subsequently &quot;summoned&quot; to come over to their
place
to view it on DVD. And you know what? I'm glad they did.<br /><br />        The story takes place in the future where technology has taken
over
the world. In fact, Earth as you know it has been transformed into
a
technological play ground where reality and fantasy are so intertwined
that
it is almost impossible to tell where one ends and the other begins. We
meet
Neo (Keanu Reeves) at the beginning and find out quickly that this
quiet
young man is actually a brilliant computer hacker. He is quickly
recruited
by a band of secrete underground rebels who hope to free the world from
the
clutches of technology. It seems that computers in the future have
become
self-aware and have taken over the world by enslaving humans and
these
rebels lead by Morpheous (Laurence Fishburne) are hoping that Neo is
the
&quot;Chosen-One&quot; to free them from this slavery.<br /><br />        I have to say that the special effects are wonderful. I've
seen
quite a few special effects intensive movies this year and The Matrix
comes
out very near the top. The only other one that I thought was better is
Star
Wars but that was to be expected when 95% of it was computer generated
and
George Lucas is backing it. The Matrix comes very close and in fact in
some
places out performs Star Wars in the creativity department.<br /><br />        I mentioned earlier that I stayed away from this movie because
of
Keanu Reeves and I'm sure many of you will agree that he is not in the
same
echelon as Tom Cruise or Kevin Spacey but I was pleasantly surprised
here.
He did do a fairly good job as Neo but part of it was the fact that he
did
do his own stunts and brought a sense of believability to his
character.
What made this movie even better was the rest of the cast,
especially
Laurence Fishburne. He had a lot of thought provoking dialogue in this
movie
and his portrayal of the rebel leader and mentor to Neo was
well
depicted...although it did seem somewhat similar to Yoda and Luke
Skywalker.
The one actor that I really did enjoy was Joe Pantoliano as Cypher.
He
played the laid back, yet somewhat cynical rebel very well and when he
turns
on his comrades his performance becomes even more enjoyable.<br /><br />        If you choose to see this movie, keep in mind that this movie
is
primarily about ideas. Focusing on plot flow will only ruin the
movie's
intentions. I have seen other reviews where people commented on the laws
of
physics or other such scientific evaluations and to be honest, this is
only
a movie. Its intention is to portray some idea(s), not to educated
the
public about energy transfer or the laws of relativity. This movie
makes
quite a statement about what reality is and how we perceive it so if any
of
you are looking to see a thought provoking movie with some pretty
impressive
special effects, go see this movie.<br /><br />A<br /><br />
