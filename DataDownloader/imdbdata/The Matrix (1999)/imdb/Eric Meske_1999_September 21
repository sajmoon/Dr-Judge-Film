When I first saw the trailers for The Matrix, I had visions of Johnny
Mnemonic 2.  Fortunately this is not the case.  While not being terribly
original, The Matrix is a movie with interesting ideas, spectacular FX,
and
stunning action sequences.  The Wachowski Bros. have quickly risen to the
ranks of the best action directors, showing an eye for detail and quality
that is on par with James Cameron.<br /><br />I despise Keanu Reeves with every fiber of my being.  That is why I am
surprised by how much I like this movie.  The rest of the cast does an
admirable job in the acting department, and helps Reeves maintain a screen
persona that does not make you want to throw up.<br /><br />The Matrix is exciting, intelligent, beautiful, and one of the most
entertaining movies of the last few years.
