Many seem to praise the movie and insert a &quot;but&quot; for Keanu's acting.  I have
no problem with it simply because if you think about it, Neo should have a
befuddled &quot;How did I get into this mess?&quot; look about him.  Any other actor
would be tempted to mug or emote and that would distract from the plot.
