1999_April 4 

When I walked into the theater to see Matrix, I didn't know
what
to expect.  Honestly, I wasn't expecting all that much.  The previews that
were shown on talk shows were really cheesy, but I gave it a shot.  I have
to say that Matrix is one of the best movies I have seen in a few years.
The special effects are very special and the acting is surprisingly great.
I loved the concept of the movie and best of all, it made me think.  If you
don't like to think while watching a movie, then don't see Matrix.  But...
if you want to see a good movie that makes you care about the characters and
outcome.... Then see Matrix.  It is worth your 7 bucks.
