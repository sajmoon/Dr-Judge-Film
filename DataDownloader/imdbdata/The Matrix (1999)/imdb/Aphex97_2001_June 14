Question reality. Question everything. Its hard not to like a film that has
this much attitude. Rarely does a big budget Hollywood movie send such a
strong message about looking deeper into the world around oneself and
thinking independently of the crowd. I saw this movie numerous times in the
theater. One of the most interesting and original sci-fi premises of our
modern technology driven time. <br /><br />Excellent plot, dazzling stunts, top notch special effects, and great
characters all combine to create a wonderful film. Sometimes the dialogue is
rather weak, but this movie is so full of kinetic energy, you can't get
bored with it. Fans of all genres should enjoy. <br /><br />Final Rating: 8/10<br /><br />Noob Aalox
