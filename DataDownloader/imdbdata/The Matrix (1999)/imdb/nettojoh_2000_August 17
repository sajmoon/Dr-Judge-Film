This movie was entertaining, but I must say I'm baffled by all the hype
and
enthusiasm.  The movie rolled along with lots of action and violence so
you
weren't bored.  I've seen comments on this being a thinking man's movie,
it's not even a thinking producer's movie.  There are basically two
&quot;ideas&quot;
in the movie (I won't spoil, because they are the movie).  Both of these
ideas are simply grabbed from other science fiction writing without any
sort
of original twist, except for combining them.  When you first learn about
these two main ideas it's surprising only because they come from nowhere,
you're not really expecting them, but you are trying to figure out a few
things.  Up to this point in the movie it's pretty neat, but lacks any
subtlety, they just throw it at you.  After they introduce the two main
themes just sit back and watch the action, nothing else intriguing
happens.<br /><br />As I said before, the movie keeps moving so you don't get bored. But after
a
while the gaps in logic and inconsistencies get a little overwhelming.
Part
of fantasy stories is the creation of a universe where certain rules apply
that may be different than what we are used to, whether it's in space or
software.   This movie makes no attempt at explaining anything, and with
the
stuff they throw at you, they need to explain it (for the thinking man at
least).  Science fiction doesn't need to be believable, per se (it is
fiction), but it should be believable within the boundaries set for that
story.  It's seems like they wrote the plot as a first try and didn't
bother
with details.  For example, what's up with the phone thing why not just
click you're heels together three times.  &quot;The body can't live without the
brain&quot; doesn't mean you can just sort of makeup arbitrary rules throughout
the story.<br /><br />Another thing I can't figure out is why in this universe they have to walk
around with stone faces all the time.  Perhaps that was just too make sure
Keanu Reeves didn't stand out as a bad actor.  It worked, this was the
least
annoying role I've seen him in.  A movie without any dialogue is a perfect
fit for Keanu.<br /><br />Despite the shallowness of the movies and the bad acting, I did enjoy
watching it, but not as a thinking man.  If you just let the movie unfold
in
front of you it has enough action and graphics to be entertaining.<br /><br />It does sadden me how such a one dimensional movie can overwhelm the minds
of people.  Maybe you all need to read a book once in a while to
understand
what real complexity is.  Just throwing out someone else's ideas with
computer graphics does not make a genius, although it can be
entertaining.
