This movie &quot;The Matrix&quot; is a rush because I've never seen a movie quite like
this.  It's about a computer hacker named Thomas Anderson aka Neo (Keanu
Reeves) has his life endangered by artificial agents.  With the help of
Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), they would
help Neo to stop these evil agents and help him to find the matrix.  I love
the effects involving the kung-fu and violent action effects in this movie
and I also love the hard-edge visuals in this movie as well.  These visuals
will be copycating other films from other directors, but It won't replace
this film and It's the best Keanu Reeves film since Speed.
