&quot;The Matrix&quot; is not only the greatest sci fi movie ever made, but THE
GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!  There was not one thing in this movie that I
didn't like.  It was the most mind blowing experience I've ever had at the
movies!  If you have not seen this film yet, please, SEE IT NOW!!!  You will
NOT be disappointed!  On a four star scale, &quot;THE MATRIX&quot; gets a
5!
