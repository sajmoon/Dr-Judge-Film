1999_April 14 

I read a few reviews and I agreed with alot of them.  I liked the movie.
But what I really liked was that the preview didn't tell me the whole
movie.
All the previews I have seen lately show you the whole movie even the
ending
or at least enough to guess the ending.  This movie only told you enough
to
be interested.  I did not know what the matrix was Until I saw the movie.
I
suggest any scifi fan see this movie.  Round of applause to the
advertising
people for this film.
