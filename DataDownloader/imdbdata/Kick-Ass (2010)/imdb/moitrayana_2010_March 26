You know that rare feeling... happens every year or so... when you pour
out of the cinema SO excited at the film you&#x27;ve just watched, and every
other word is &#x22;ohmygodilovedtwithbitwherethey&#x22;? Well &#x27;Ding&#x27;, Kick ass
hits that sweet spot. Comprising teen comedy, kick-ass action (sorry)
and a healthy dose of comic book style violence and gore, it rocks.<br /><br />It&#x27;s Superbad meets Kill Bill.<br /><br />The film is a fairly faithful adaptation of the comic book, and where
tweaks have been made, they make the plot more robust for the audience
to empathise with.<br /><br />Kick-ass is stylish, fun, daring, and the dark surprise of violence and
gore kept the balance of comic teen angst fresh: a delicious perk me up
when you were settling into comedy mode. There was never a dull moment
in the pace of the film, never a flimsy plot point, and actually the
audience guffawed their way through the film. Did I mention it has a
cool soundtrack to boot? I&#x27;ve already got it on my Phone.
