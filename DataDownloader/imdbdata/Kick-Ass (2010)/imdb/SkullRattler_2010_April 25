I registered here to review this film, as I believe the high rating it
has is a result of manipulation. I went to the cinema to see this after
checking out the reviews here, and it has irreparrably damaged my
confidence in IMDb. . . <br /><br />It is clear that the review system is being manipulated to give UTTER
TRASH like this high ratings on IMDb. <br /><br />CHILD EXPLOITATION<br /><br />I suppose if you&#x27;re a Hollywood producer backed by enough money to
market your product, you can exploit children in your film. You can
also assist in the progressive de-sensitization of the masses to
violence and pretend to be provocative and original by getting your
child actress to act out scenes of murder and extreme violence. You can
do all this and still get rave reviews in the mainstream media , who
are getting payed by your bosses, so who cares about human values
anymore? People who find this film funny, or good in any way have some
serious problems, in my opinion. This is like a bunch of retarded,
coked-up teenagers with lots of cash to burn trying to be as awful as
Tarantino in his worse moments. If you think this would be funny
somehow, you are mistaken. This juvenile, onanistic sh!t is like the
worse straight-to-DVD American trash you can pick up for a buck in junk
stores. <br /><br />The facts : this film is marketed to young people; has received rave
reviews and has not been utterly condemned for its abusive, criminal
exploitation of the worse parts of human nature and Amerikanised trash
&#x22;culture&#x22; . Pretty depressing, and this has lots to say about the
hopelessness of our &#x22;civilisation&#x22;. It&#x27;s funny if you have the humour
of a sociopathic 13-year old boy from New Jersey. And it is precisely
this demographic that should be kept away from films like this at all
costs.<br /><br />Hollywood continues with its campaign to completely erode humane values
and de-sensitize people to violence and torture. How come full-on sex
scenes including genitals are taboo, but scenes of gory murder and
torture are now so commonplace that even children can participate? How
did we get here? <br /><br />Thugggish violence and shootings in schools by under-age psychopaths
can be expected to continue with increased regularity thanks to films
like this. Violence and torture are funny, yeah , as funny as a
full-force baseball-bat hit to your genitals. <br /><br />Like another reviewer has said: AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE
