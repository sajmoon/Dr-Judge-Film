More of the same, basically. Kick ass starts off with a good premise.
It develops the characters with a shallow approach and a few joke
threats.<br /><br />After the initial introduction the film wanders off into pointless self
indulgent garbage.<br /><br />It&#x27;s definitely a 1 out of 10. I&#x27;ll give it a one because i sketched a
smile for about 3 seconds throughout the first half.<br /><br />i am also bothered to see the American movie industry releasing stuff
like this. I thought it had reached the rock bottom but guess what...
it&#x27;s lowering standards still.<br /><br />Cheers.
