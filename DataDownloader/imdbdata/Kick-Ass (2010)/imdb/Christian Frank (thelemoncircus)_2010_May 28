I gave it a 1 out of 10 because I rated it as a Superhero movie. If it
was rated as a gory blood fest with killings and guts etc then maybe
I&#x27;d give it a 2.<br /><br />If you are a 15 year old - or somehow haven&#x27;t matured enough in your
20&#x27;s or 30&#x27;s and still listen to Zane Lowe on radio 1 for your next CD
to buy - then maybe it is for you. I hasten to add that even when I was
15 - I would need not only to have gone back in time but changed my
entire physical self to some kind of moron that confuses a superhero
movie with a dark comedy about gangsters with &#x27;American Pie&#x27;
characters. Just for the record when I was 15, &#x27;Weird Science&#x27; was my
best film.<br /><br />Let&#x27;s get one thing straight before we begin - I love comics, the smell
they have, how you hold them - the very look and experience of the
fantasy and the magic. I understood why a teenager would want to be a
superhero - so the movie starts with a good premise - but remains in a
world void of that spirit. Give me Superman, Spiderman, Batman any day.
It&#x27;s fun - the comic book experience. It was NEVER about engaging with
the readers to make them feel ill. It was never about offending
sensitivities. It was about good overcoming evil. Simple. Check the
ticket returns for a real superhero movie Vs &#x27;this attempt&#x27;.<br /><br />I really felt that this movie insulted the genre of superhero films. If
you wanted comedy - watch &#x27;Mystery Men&#x27; - keeps the same dreams with
misfit characters. This movie is violent just for the sake of pulling
itself through each and every sordid scene. Luckily it sits by itself
unable to be bench marked. I haven&#x27;t logged into my IMDb account in
such a long time, but felt it necessary to counter the positive
reviews. Sorry! I needed to shout to anyone mature enough who enjoys
comic adaptations (and yes I can see the oxymoron &#x27;Mature = Comics&#x27;) to
make a reasoned judgement about watching this &#x22;piece of filth&#x22;. I know
that sounds like I work for the Daily Mail, but for the sake of freedom
of expression - I would stop no one who wants to genuinely sit through
this - then fine, but for perhaps parents who have children almost the
age of Hit Girl say 11, and thinking her use of salty language is funny
- forget it. If my daughter spoke like that I would be mortified - it&#x27;s
just not funny or cool or&#x85; anything.<br /><br />This - people belongs on the top shelf with other adult publications -
not comics. It&#x27;s like the Viz comic, but no where near as funny. It&#x27;s
marketed and aimed at young adults (which of course will include school
children) and it is definitely not suitable for them. This picture is
sick and twisted and no impressionable youngsters should be viewing
these images. Hollywood has an open weeping sore. It&#x27;s not well.
Another symptom of our fallen social morals. We think this is cool?
Really? God help us all.
