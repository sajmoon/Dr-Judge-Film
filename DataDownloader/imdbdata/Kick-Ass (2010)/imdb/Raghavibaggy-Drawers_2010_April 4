It has the time line and self-consciously-culture-smart soundtrack of
Hair, yet the campy fun and karaoke stylings of Moulin Rouge. Matthew
Vaughn takes this combination and makes it fun, instead of extra
cheesy, and it is visually fascinating instead of the obnoxious
MTV-video nightmare it could have been.<br /><br />I found a poster that promoted the film as: Make to-do &#x22;SPIDERMAN 3&#x22; as
&#x22;Sesamo street&#x22;!- I cared about the characters - and the cast of
&#x27;unknowns&#x27; have great star power and voices. Even though I knew exactly
what would happen, the journey there was great. The cameos were fun. I
love musicals as much as the next person, but this this thing was dead
on arrival. it&#x27;s a shame though, we needed a good movie about Vietnam
and the happenings during the 60&#x27;s. i&#x27;d appreciate a movie like that
more, than this trash that really had no story. i can&#x27;t even tell you
what the film was about if my life depended on it. Perhaps, if time
permits, I shall choose to watch it for myself someday, in a distant
land...<br /><br />I AM HELPLESS !!!! I do not know what else to say about this paplum. If
you just bought the DVD, go burn it. If you like WW2 Movies, get
yourself a copy of &#x22;M*A*S*H&#x22;, if you need to be reminded of how cruel
humans can be to others in total disrespect of life, love, and anything
that matters to most of us today, &#x22;The Dog Town Lord&#x22; is a wonderful,
yet very disturbing piece of Art, as it is &#x22;Schindlers Fist&#x22;. If you
like good Fantasy Stories, maybe have some episodes of &#x22;Female Warrior
Xena&#x22;. Drama: &#x22;Driving Miss Daisy&#x22; is A MASTERPIECE !!! And if it so
happens that you are an absolutely devoted fan of
deep-brain-cell-destruction-while-in-a-totally-drunken-state-of-mind, a
copy of jackass, jackass the movie 1,2 or (even 3 someday?) might be
your choice of the moment, or ....
