Either we live in the world where a skillful marketing can make
everyone&#x27;s mind about the movie and sell it or... I don&#x27;t know! <br /><br />With quite interesting idea in its sleeve (a kid with no power becomes
a &#x27;superhero&#x27;) the movie turns out to be a complete disaster. It&#x27;s
repetitive, boring, not that funny at all, has no likable characters
(just psychos, dumb teens and even more dumb and psychotic &#x27;villains&#x27;)
and is completely inconsistent in its form. <br /><br />The idea is to put lots of typical clich&#xE9;s from different genres (teen
comedies like American Pie, buddy movies, bloody revenge movies) and
rip-offs from other comic-books (Batman, Spiderman, Punisher and even
Iron Man) and put everything into a bag of movie sh.. as the main focus
is to pack the sliced and incoherent story with never-ending bloody
fight and torture scenes involving a kid stabbing, slicing and crushing
people. <br /><br />Hit Girl is stealing the show, right!?<br /><br />It&#x27;s like telling a 3-year-old to say &#x27;F..k&#x27; and laughing because it
sounds sooo funny. Then maybe he or she can kill a cat with a knife
because you don&#x27;t often see many 3-year-olds doing such a thing. The
wise producers could do another popcorn flick set in primary school
about kids killing Nazis and necrophiliacs. Sure they&#x27;ve never ever
done that before! But should they! Is it really that funny for general
audience nowadays? <br /><br />Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I have nothing against violence in movies if it has
SOME point to the story or even if it&#x27;s nicely stylized (Sin City,
300). But in times of Saws the sickening violence has no other point
apart from &#x27;pleasing the audience&#x27; and Kick-Ass might be at the top of
this statement. It can really make someone feel that comic books are
worthless, pointless and derivative piece of crap that base their
originality on pushing the boundaries in showing the violence rather
than coming up with some decent storytelling. Kick Ass is as funny as
interesting. Simply awful.
