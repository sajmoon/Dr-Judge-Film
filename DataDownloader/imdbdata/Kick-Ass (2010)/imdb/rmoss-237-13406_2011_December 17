I cannot believe how amazing this movie is. This movie may not be a
classic but deserves a 10 for entertaining. This is indeed the best
action movie i have seen in my lifetime. The action scenes in this
movie shot adrenaline directly into my heart.<br /><br />I have never been a fan of superheros but this is not your average
superhero movie lets be honest there is not a lot of superheroes who
use guns and involve drugs. The main reason i watched this movie is
because of the cast. if it wasn&#x27;t for them i would still be waiting to
figure out what my favorite movie is. if you are action hungry this is
a MUST SEE.<br /><br />To sum it all up buy this and watch it as many times until you grow
bored of it (which will never happen) and wait for the second one to
come out and blow your mind some more.
