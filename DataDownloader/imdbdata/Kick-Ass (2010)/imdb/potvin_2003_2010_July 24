Get in, sit down and buckle up for one of the worst movies of all time!
Words cannot explain how bad this movie is. I don&#x27;t know how it gets
any decent ratings at all. Mix cheesy acting with an almost clich&#xE9; type
superhero movie and you have this. It was literally the worst movie I
have seen this year. I was very apprehensive about watching another
&#x22;superhero&#x22; movie. But through the reviews on here, and the actors in
the movie, I thought I would really give it a go. Big mistake. It&#x27;s not
even worth TRYING to like. And the little girl in there swearing was
not even remotely funny. It didn&#x27;t add anything to the movie except
maybe making a bunch of 12 year old viewers pee themselves. Speaking of
12 year olds, how come every male in that movie seemed to have a higher
voice then most of the females? I mean it was just gut wrenching
sitting there listening to 90 minutes of prepubescent punks whining. I
mean I would have rather waited another couple years until they past
puberty than listen to their annoying voices.<br /><br />All in all though, I think they really tried to attract an audience of
young teenagers. The movie didn&#x27;t appeal to me at all and I am pretty
confident it wouldn&#x27;t to a lot of adults out there. <br /><br />Now there&#x27;s no point in revealing any spoilers - if you wanna waste 90
minutes of your life feel free to do that. But i don&#x27;t even wanna call
it spoilers. When u spoil something it means you made something go from
good to bad. But this movie isn&#x27;t good. It sucks! Well, I am threw
ranting - it&#x27;s been a long time since I watched a movie that made me
feel like the Angry Video Game Nerd.<br /><br />Happy viewing!
