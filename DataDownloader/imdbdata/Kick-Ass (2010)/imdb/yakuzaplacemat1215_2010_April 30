Sometimes in life you have to make a stand, even when it&#x27;s unpopular to
do so.<br /><br />We here in the USA and in other countries have become societies where
just about anything goes in the name of entertainment or making a
profit. You want to play &#x22;a game&#x22; where you can blow off people&#x27;s heads
then watch the blood squirt in High Definition ? No problem you can buy
various varieties of them easily. You want to see porn films where the
actress pretends to be underage or that she is getting raped
mercilessly, it&#x27;s out there. You like snuff films? They have simulated
ones of those too for your viewing pleasure. Even real ones if you look
hard enough. There are even films of women and men having sex with
animals for those of you into that. I suppose the people that watch and
support these films justify it by thinking &#x22;Hey, I&#x27;m not doing it
myself...I&#x27;m just being entertained watching others do it&#x22;. But what
does that say about you as an individual if this is where you seek
entertainment and a sense of fun? These films are all an insult to
human dignity, something you would think we&#x27;d all have a common ground
to stand against. How could they instead become something viewed for
enjoyment? This film reminds me of the various medical atrocities the
Nazi&#x27;s inflicted on unfortunate prisoners. Even the costumes in it are
German biker gang uniforms. I won&#x27;t list those atrocities here, but
they were real they happened, they weren&#x27;t fictional or simulated. If
you could get your hands on actual films of those Nazi experiments and
their outcomes would you watch them for fun? Is squirming uncomfortably
at a visual assault to your sense of right and wrong a thrill for you ?
Do you drool at the thought of hurting others? Does that feeling
justify whatever you are watching? If so, you need serious help and the
rest of us need protection from the likes of you. If you wouldn&#x27;t view
that then don&#x27;t watch this assault on human dignity either fictional or
not. Make a stand for human dignity.<br /><br />I feel ashamed to be a member of the human race when I see a film like
this is making money for some sicko movie makers. No, it&#x27;s not just a
metaphorical comment on anything as some would like you to believe.
Stand up and say &#x22;ENOUGH !&#x22;. Don&#x27;t be afraid if you&#x27;re insulted and
ridiculed for having a sense of morality in a world where a growing
number of people have none. Do what you know in your heart is morally
right.<br /><br />Please do not spend money to view this film. Send a message to those
that try to profit by making them. These profiteers are exploiting
human dignity for the sake of their own wealth. Don&#x27;t be a part of it.
Historically inaccurate, pathetic, unrealistic and offensive towards
Germans.
