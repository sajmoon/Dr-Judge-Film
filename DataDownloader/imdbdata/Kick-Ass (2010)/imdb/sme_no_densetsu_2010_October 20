&#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; asks the question, &#x22;What would happen if an ordinary guy
decided to become a superhero?&#x22; The answer is that he becomes a
cultural phenomenon even though he basically sucks at crime-fighting.
However, before long he crosses the path of a father and daughter team
who really know what they&#x27;re doing. Pretty soon he&#x27;s in way over his
head and has the local crime boss out to get him.<br /><br />The story is an interesting one even though it doesn&#x27;t really live up
to its potential. The title character is the least interesting
character in the movie. Given that fact, it&#x27;s probably a good thing
that the more conventional superheroes Hit-Girl and Big Daddy show up.
Of course, their introduction makes the story more akin to the usual
superhero fare. Where this film really separates itself from the pack
is in the R-rated violence, not the slightly-more-realistic-than-usual
setup.<br /><br />The acting is in pretty good hands, at least for a superhero movie.
Aaron Johnson is fairly unremarkable as the title character but,
luckily, the show is stolen by pre-teen Chloe Moretz, who plays
Hit-Girl. Nic Cage also gives an interesting performance as Big Daddy,
Hit-Girl&#x27;s father. Few others really stand out, mainly because most of
the characters are clich&#xE9;d and/or one-dimensional.<br /><br />The directorial style of Matthew Vaughan is energetic and well suited
to the comic book material. The special effects are pretty decent as
well though they&#x27;re nothing to write home about. The soundtrack is
pretty hip, too, but to me it seemed a bit overbearing.<br /><br />Overall, &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; is among the best superhero movies I&#x27;ve seen but it
certainly isn&#x27;t without its faults. The grit of the film goes a long
way in covering up its shortcomings, though, and the character of
Hit-Girl is destined for cult status. Some may find the action too
violent but I think it only seems excessively violent in comparison
with the usual PG-13 superhero fare.
