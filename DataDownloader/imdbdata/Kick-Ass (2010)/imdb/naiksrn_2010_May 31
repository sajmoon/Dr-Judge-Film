I saw the previews for this and thought this was going to be one of
those slapstick stupid comedy movies (Superbad, Super Hero Movie). I
came on IMDb and saw the rating and the reviews and I thought I&#x27;d
reconsider after doing some research on this. I was very wrong with my
initial assessment. Yes, there&#x27;s some teen comedic elements to this
movie, but the movie flowed perfectly. Great Soundtrack, great fight
scenes, acting was good, story was great and original. With a current
IMDb rating of 8.3 as I write this, look&#x27;s like I&#x27;m not alone on how I
rated this movie. Show stealer was definitely Hit Girl. I foresee her
having a huge career. Possibly the next Natalie Portman. Reminded me of
Natalie&#x27;s role in Leon. Which leads me to my next point. Unless you&#x27;re
into comic books, video games, in your teens/20&#x27;s/30&#x27;s and don&#x27;t have a
young kid, you might be taken aback that a little 11 year old girl is
killing people and using bad words. For those that gave this a bad
review because of that, do some research on a movie before you go see
something that you think you won&#x27;t like. I hate musicals and I&#x27;m not
going to pay 10 bucks to see High School Musical and then come in here
and complain that there was too much singing and dancing. It&#x27;s clearly
geared at a older teen/young adult audience and is rated R, what did
you expect. In closing, one of the most entertaining films I&#x27;ve ever
seen.
