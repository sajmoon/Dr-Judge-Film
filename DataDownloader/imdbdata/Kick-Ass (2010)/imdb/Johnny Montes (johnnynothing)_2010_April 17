I&#x27;ve first heard about Kick-Ass and been waiting to see it since
November 2009. After I began to read the comics and they were very
good! I&#x27;m just very happy I got the chance to finally see the movie
yesterday at 10:30 pm. I have never done a review for a movie before,
but I&#x27;ll try to explain my opinions well.<br /><br />Let me just say that Kick-Ass is nothing like any other superhero movie
out there. It&#x27;s not even like any other action/comedy/suspense movie
you&#x27;ll view out there!<br /><br />I loved Dave/Kick-Ass&#x27; character because he relates to most teens these
days. He was very silly, slow but smart, and was just totally
outrageously funny and had quirky lines. I thought Aaron Johnson played
his part perfectly well. Especially the hilarious but &#x27;kick-ass&#x27; fight
scenes he was in. When I first saw Red Mist, I already loved him. He
was a spoiled, annoying and conceited kid. And Christopher Mintz-Plasse
did a very great job at portraying that type of character. It was
definitely something different than &#x27;McLovin&#x27; and much more of an
interesting character brought to the table! Hit-Girl was absolutely
amazing and ridiculously insane! I loved her and I&#x27;m pretty sure the
audience did too. She can be so innocent and sweet as a regular child,
but when she&#x27;s in her mask and hardcore crime-fighting purple outfit
she&#x27;s just stunningly awesome! No one is like Hit-Girl, and I can yell
that to anyone! Chloe Moretz is an amazing actress and she seems like
she has a very bright future ahead of her. I admire her acting and her
movies. Lastly, Big Daddy was not only the most hardcore character in
the film, but he had to do a lot with the plot and storyline. Not to
mention his super funny Adam West impressions. I loved Big Daddy, but
hated what happened near the end (movie and comic-wise).<br /><br />Kick-Ass the most exhilarating, jaw-dropping, and the most hilarious
movie I&#x27;ve ever seen in my 16 years! I loved every single moment in the
film and found most of the humor very funny. Before seeing the movie, I
got a little scared that it might be just another &#x27;let down&#x27; or
&#x27;walk-out&#x27; movie I&#x27;d have to deal with. But it wasn&#x27;t. It was very
perfectly entertaining and satisfying for me in many ways. Kick-Ass is
definitely one my favorite films ever, and it was just simply the most
amazing and hilarious film nobody can&#x27;t miss! Not to mention that it
was just super fun and exciting just like riding a roller-coaster! This
is the perfect superhero movie anyone would enjoy.<br /><br />Thank you America, for not letting me down on this one!
