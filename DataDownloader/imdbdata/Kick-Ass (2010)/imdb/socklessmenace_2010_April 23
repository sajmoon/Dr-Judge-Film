Anyone who has ever wished to be a superhero, pretended to fly, super
punch, turn invisible or just plain kick some ass but knew you never
could...here&#x27;s the movie for you!<br /><br />Although deserving it&#x27;s 18A R rating, this movie will blow your mind
with awesomeness, yes thats right AWESOMENESS. The main character
Kick-Ass is both comedic, quirky, and relatable (weather to yourself or
someone you know) to anyone who&#x27;s ever been to high school. His
friends, also comedic, also will remind any guy of their own little
group of three musketeers talking about movies, sports, comics and of
coarse girls. The other heroes, such as Hit-Girl (who alone could
provides the R rating) and Big-Daddy act as a total sub plot to the
film that eventually mashes together with Kick-ass&#x27;s story. They
provide the majority of the REAL ASS KICKING. Also the characters
actually get so connected with you that by the end you will actually
feel and sympathize with the obstacles and tragedies they have to go
through. Despite all the blood and violence there are some touching
moments in this film.<br /><br />In all, this movie rocked, it&#x27;s not for kids, it&#x27;ll blow your mind, the
filming technique was great props to the director, the acting was good,
the action was sweet, and the movie in total kicked some SERIOUS ASS!!!
