This film is really let down by it&#x27;s DVD cover, the cover makes it look
like a childish moronic superhero movie trying to be better than it
actually is. However, don&#x27;t take one look at the cover and turn away,
this film is possibly my favourite film ever. This film combines gore,
violence, comedy and sex. So, in actual fact, it&#x27;s more adult than
childish although I was only 13 when i first saw it and i thoroughly
enjoyed it as did my 42 year-old dad who is very critical about most
films so this really says something. As for the foul-mouthed 12-year
old, do not be put off by this as this may not be entertaining but this
makes the film what it is and you kind of just have to ignore the use
of the C-word in one of the scenes. Even though this film is classed as
comedy, it is very dark and even made me cry at one point. The intense
blend of action with background music is amazing. This film has the
coolest fight scenes i have EVER seen. Anyone in the right mind would
want to see this, i recently got it on blu-ray and it astonished me how
good the quality was so i definitely recommended it.
