This film&#x27;s a bit of a mess to be honest. As you already know from the
trailer, Aaron Johnson puts on an outfit and starts to answer back to
bad guys. The problem is that the coming of age flick that Matthew
Vaughan knows is in here simply gets forgotten as he pursues his
bloodlust for copious violence. This is the same indulgent,
market-distracted attitude that allowed Richard Curtis to give us the
aberration that is Love Actually; interesting ideas sacrificed on the
sopping wet altar of the cheap thrill.<br /><br />Disappointingly, even for the Grindhousephile, the violence is
particularly boring. It apes but never manages to re-create the style
of Sin City, The Matrix, Kill Bill etc. Equally, part of the
exhilaration of (for example) Kill Bill is that the violence wasn&#x27;t
particularly comic. Vaughan&#x27;s pushiness with a ready gag at such
moments really saps the energy. As I&#x27;ve suggested, the high-school
rite-of-passage film that is the most promising element of the film
never gets traction. The early jump-cut sniggering about jerking off is
soon neglected for action (involving a really grim fetish for blades).<br /><br />I like Aaron Johnson and one can&#x27;t ignore anything Mark Strong is in,
although he&#x27;s clearly playing the goon. Chloe Moretz is impressive,
although characteristically one-dimensional and (another Curtisism) is
given a jarring, unnecessary pottymouth. Everyone else is dreadful,
B-for-bland-movie staple. A wasted opportunity. 3/10
