I don&#x27;t know what people see in this film its not that great its &#x22;okay&#x22;
at its best. Nick age was god awful in this. my geek brain cannot
fathom why he chose to do this character the way he did with the
unnatural dialect. I think this film could have been so much better if
Nick was mute in it or played the part as it was originally written..
the flying sequence was garbage &#x22;worst ever&#x22; but.. it wasn&#x27;t all
terrible any time hit girl was on screen was amazing, any time she was
on screen the movie very suddenly changed its format it had a great
soundtrack and action sequence but as sudden as it came, it went back
to trying to be the lames movie ever..<br /><br />Final thought - watch this if you&#x27;ve never read the comic and have
nothing else to do, otherwise stay away this movie does not hold a
match to the original story by comparison this is complete canine
stool..<br /><br />thanks for your time and i hope this review helped you make a decision.
