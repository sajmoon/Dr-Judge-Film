This movie is confused about what it wants to be. A comedy? There was
nothing funny about it. An action movie? Well, there was a lot of
action and gratuitous violence. I have also heard some claim this is a
parody of Kill Bill. Not bloody likely! Kill Bill (and all Tarantino
flicks) was pure genius in the music, the camera angles, the story.
Kick Ass had poor acting, pathetic writing and the directing was
wooden!<br /><br />Based upon the comments posted here, this movie apparently appeals to
prepubescent fan boys that get off watching an 11 year old curse and
maim other people.<br /><br />I give this waste of celluloid a very generous 2 only because a rating
of 1 should be reserved for complete trash like Battlefield Earth.
