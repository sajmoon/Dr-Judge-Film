This is definitely the best movie of 2010 so far, hands down. Not only
is it insanely funny throughout, it has a great story and in-your-face
action that will (pun intended) kick your ass. <br /><br />It&#x27;s the story of a high school comic book nerd who decides he&#x27;s going
to take up being a costumed hero because no one else will. Early on he
discovers that society could care less about the evils that be, and he
takes it upon himself to do something about it. But of course none of
the &#x22;super heroes&#x22; in the movie actually have powers, because it&#x27;s
about real people kicking real ass. Early on you&#x27;ll find the
protagonist, Dave, is a pushover and even as his costumed alter-ego,
Kick-Ass, he can&#x27;t succeed in anything he does. He comes off as an
extremely unlikable character, but as the story unfolds and he gets
mixed up with other costumed heroes who really do kick ass, he slowly
becomes the perfect anti-hero and a character which will most likely be
a new icon in popular culture. <br /><br />The script for the film is remarkably well written and it managed to
combine hilarious comedy with incredibly graphic, stylized violence.
Never have I seen a movie that combined the two so well. One moment,
you&#x27;ll be crying from laughter and the next you&#x27;ll be squinching at a
little girl slaughtering grown men with the slightest of ease. <br /><br />The directing was top-notch and this is the first film i&#x27;ve seen from
Matthew Vaughn. If Kick-Ass doesn&#x27;t put him on the map as one of the
most sought after directors in Hollywood then I don&#x27;t know what will.<br /><br />The acting was superb from the entire cast, especially from veteran
Nicolas Cage. He played his part perfectly and I couldn&#x27;t see any one
else as Big Daddy. As impressed as I was with Cage&#x27;s performance, I was
blown away with how well Chloe Moretz, Hit-Girl, played her part. She
definitely stole the show.<br /><br />I honestly couldn&#x27;t recommend this movie more, and it has become one of
my new personal favorites. Kick-Ass is a film about finding your
identity and daring to do something no one else will. Yet it&#x27;s also an
intricate tale of revenge, which is masterfully crafted to be one of
the most entertaining pieces of fiction I have ever had the pleasure of
viewing. <br /><br />10 out of 10
