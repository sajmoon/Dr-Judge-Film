&#x22;Original&#x22; and &#x22;Unconventional&#x22; seem to be the common words used to
describe &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22;. The movie climbed to the number one spot in the
box office opening weekend, climbed up the prestigious IMDb Top 250
Movies of All Time, and has climbed into the hearts of moviegoers
across the country. Unfortunately, all of this, especially the premise
of the movie itself, is completely misleading.<br /><br />A painfully mediocre high school student wants to make a difference in
his own dull life and in the violence-ridden streets of his own city.
Our antihero wants to become a superhero. The story starts off on the
right note, getting us engaged and bringing on some good laughs in the
process. He has no revenge story, no Martial Arts training, no money to
get a hold on any cool gadgets. However, what begins as an
&#x22;unconventional&#x22; and &#x22;original&#x22; superhero story, takes a turn and
becomes the same typical, clich&#xE9;, and generic superhero story it
intends and claims to drift away from.<br /><br />By some freak accident, he acquires a damaged nerve system that
significantly decreases the sensation of pain, and even gets some cool
metal plates integrated into his skeleton. Cool! Like accidentally
getting bitten by a radioactive spider.<br /><br />Then he meets Bid Daddy and Hit Girl. People love Hit Girl, and what&#x27;s
not to love? She&#x27;s an 11-year old kid who can say bad words, dodge
bullets, and kill a dozen bad guys at once. People say this movie has
no gimmicks. An 11-year-old kid who can say bad words, dodge bullets,
and kill a dozen bad guys at once is a total gimmick. Big Daddy is a
supercop with a vendetta and Hit Girl is his daughter who has learned
everything a supercop knows. They have a revenge story, and even have a
ton of money which allows them to buy a bunch of fancy new weapons.
Cool! Just like Batman.<br /><br />Sure there may be some entertainment value in it for you, (if you&#x27;re
into a couple masturbation scenes and an 11-year old girl getting shot
at) and the acting is convincing enough, given the ridiculousness of
the story. The movie only falls short in being something other than
what it claims to be. &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; is not &#x22;original&#x22; (see Blankman) and
is not &#x22;unconventional&#x22; (see Spider-Man and Batman).<br /><br />The last I checked, at the bottom of the Top 250 List was &#x22;Toy Story
2,&#x22; which is more than a hundred spots short of the place &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22;
landed so quickly. If you want to see a movie that&#x27;s a hundred times
more original and unconventional than &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22;, see the movie that&#x27;s
at the bottom of the list.
