Kick-ass tells the story of Dave, a common teenager without anything
special about him. Through his sense of justice and some events he
decides to become a &#x22;Superhero&#x22; and hardly tries to save innocent
people.<br /><br />Why did I like this movie so much? Well, that&#x27;s not easy to explain.
The acting was flawless (in my opinion) with Aaron (Dave/Kick-ass),
Chloe (Hit-girl) and Christopher (Chris/Red Mist) giving their best and
shining throughout the entire movie. The storyline, even though it may
not be the most original one, is amazingly well developed. The movie
goes by at a perfect rhythm, combining comedy with action just
perfectly. The music was amazingly well picked and combined 100% with
every scene. and so on and so forth...<br /><br />When I left the theater I was so excited, so happy and so energetic, it
looked like I just had a shot of adrenaline! And I couldn&#x27;t stop
talking about the movie. It&#x27;s been a really long time since I felt this
way about a movie.<br /><br />Now I know this movie is going to feed a lot of haters. It&#x27;s normal. A
lot of people walk into the theater with their mind already set, like
&#x22;This movie is for nerds. It&#x27;s going to suck so much.&#x22;, if you have
that kind of mentality just save yourself the time and don&#x27;t watch it.
Why bother if throughout the whole movie you&#x27;re just going to be
looking for flaws or rolling your eyes at every joke.<br /><br />I loved this movie. I don&#x27;t care about anything other people say. Kick-
ass is my favorite movie of all time. I have no doubt about that.
