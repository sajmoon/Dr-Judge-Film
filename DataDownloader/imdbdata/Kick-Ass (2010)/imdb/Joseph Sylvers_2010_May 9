Everything before the appearance of Hit Girl was at least interesting,
after that the head of the movie goes so far up its own ass, it can
perform its own colonoscopy, which it then proceeds to do, as what I&#x27;m
sure some would call satire. Mark Millar&#x27;s hacky writing that&#x27;s made
him a 5th tier mainstream comic writer is present here as ever. If this
is a good adaptation of the comic (which I gave up on after issue 2)
then it&#x27;s a faithful adaptation of a bad book. &#x22;Mystery Men&#x22; and &#x22;Blank
Man&#x22; with a little girl who calls people a &#x22;c&#x26;^t&#x22; and plenty of
references to YouTube-is that what&#x27;s passing for edgy and original
these days...agro Juno? The strain of creatively impoverished Millar
writing can be traced from &#x22;Wanted&#x22;, to &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22; and the Iron Man
franchise. For instance, Samuel L. Jackson is in the new &#x22;Iron Man 2&#x22;
because Millar had artists model their new Nick Fury after him in his
&#x22;Ultimate&#x27;s&#x22; comic&#x27;s series. When Alan Moore says that modern comics
are now just a spawning ground for bigger commercial properties and
merchandise, Millar is looking more and more the eager grounds keeper.
His books come with headshots in mind.<br /><br />&#x22;With Kick-Ass, the books just out and now the movie&#x27;s out six weeks
later. And I think that&#x27;s the way things are going to go now, because
to go to Marvel&#x27;s B and C-list characters and try to get movies out
them &#x96; what&#x27;s the point of that?&#x22;-Mark Millar. I know this is the way
Kubrick went about &#x22;2001&#x22;, but this ain&#x27;t 2001. Concerning, B and C,
characters I would gladly take a &#x22;Howard the Duck&#x22; sequel any day over
Super-Bad kid doing the world&#x27;s worst Batman quote at the end of a
movie.<br /><br />As for Mathew Vaughn as director, &#x22;Kick Ass&#x22; combines the worst of his
last two films; the Guy Richie rip off of &#x22;Layer Cake&#x22; is now replaced
by embarrassingly brazen Tarantino worship, and the
stiffeled/self-congratulatory attempts at graphic-novel adaptation in
&#x22;Stardust&#x22; is present and accounted for here. Vaughn financed the film
himself, so calling this a soulless studio product isn&#x27;t accurate or
necessary. Bad indie movies get made too...agro Juno is actually more
accurate than I suspected when I started writing this.<br /><br />At the beginning Kick-Ass tells us how he isn&#x27;t like your daddy&#x27;s
super-heroes no alien origins or dead parents to avenge, no powers or
skills etc., but an hour later, were cheering on Hit-Girl&#x27;s Matrix/28
Days Later/Silence Of The Lambs/Kill Bill reference laden revenge for
her slaughtered father, and watching jet-packs streak across the sky.
Roger Ebert went too far connecting &#x22;Kick-Ass&#x22; to Columbine and
Virginia Tech. A movie can be bad without being the end of western
civilization, and though Kick-Ass isn&#x27;t very good. Children and Old
people swearing will always have produce a knee jerk ironic laugh, like
a fat man with high pitched voice, or a short person with a deep Barry
White voice, and so Kick-Ass has it&#x27;s moments of amusement(largely
thanks to Nicolas Cage).<br /><br />With great fan-boyishness comes great responsibility, and if
super-heroes have any meaning at all, it should be about more than just
kicking ass. If your reply to that &#x22;But then what else is there?&#x22;, then
just forget everything I&#x27;ve said, this is the movie for you.
