Do you want to mentally retard a person for life?This is the movie for
them.The movie itself starts off unconvincingly.As time progresses(ever
so slowly) we are introduced to the characters.My first question is who
on earth could write up such a retarded script.Next question being
which retard okay ed the movie?The action scenes were horrible.The
gangters it seems were trained to be Miss America rather than fight
therefore its not hard to understand why Hitgirl manages to do away
with 50 of them so easily.Nic Cage&#x27;s English must have been screwed up
after this flick.Aaron Johnson does nothing throughout the movie
walking around like he doesn&#x27;t how she got here.In the middle of the
movie we are even left wondering what is the plot now.Sure enough we
find out there&#x27;s going to be a final face off.The usual predictable
fare where in 2 of them take on 100 bad guys with automatic
weapons.Needless to say they came up trumps even though a grenade was
thrown at them.Mindless explosions and weapon fire.Stupid action scenes
stupid dialog&#x27;s unparalleled idiotism.This movie gives a whole new
meaning to leave your brains at home.I suggest you&#x27;d be better off
watching paint dry.But of course if you want to see why Hollywood is
still so far behind watch this.Why did i go for the movie you ask?I
have a brother who was getting on my nerves and needed a little bit of
shock therapy.This worked like a charm.
