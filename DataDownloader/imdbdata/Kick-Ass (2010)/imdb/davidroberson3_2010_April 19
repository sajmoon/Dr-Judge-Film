I created an account just to give this movie the worst rating that I
could possibly give it.<br /><br />Here are the reasons that first came to mind as to why this movie is a
glittering jewel of everything that is wrong with popular culture.<br /><br />1) Needless, unentertaining, uncreative and horribly graphic violence.
2) Needless, pathetic-attempts-at-being-funny sexual content. 3)
Needless, excessive, pathetic-attempts-at-being-funny language
(especially coming from a little girl). 4) Shallow, flimsy, and
pathetically strung-together plot. 5) Next-to-zero character
development.<br /><br />Oh, my goodness... it is painful just to try and remember this film. I
feel ashamed that Nicolas Cage would be in this movie.<br /><br />I find the lack of any redeeming value in this movie to be staggering.
I swear that my grades have dropped just because of the brain cells
killed during the watching of this movie.
