Personally, I found this film to be incredibly enjoyable and I really
don&#x27;t mean that in a sadistic sense.<br /><br />Firstly, the character, Kick-Ass (Aaron Johnson), is inspiring to me.
He portrays a plausible teenage vigilante. He starts off very brave,
tenacious, reasonable and truly heroic! I think my favourite scene is
where he defends a victim from 3 thugs, in front of people and endures
numerous hits (both physically and on Youtube). The scene works
perfectly to the tune &#x27;Omen&#x27; by The Prodigy and, in a way, the fight
scene is an omen in the film.<br /><br />The film is similar to &#x27;Hot Fuzz&#x27; because it starts off realistically,
set in a world of selfish people, corruption and apathetic witnesses
and yet only one guy is desperately trying to do the right thing.
However, all hell breaks loose and both films end in a ridiculous and
violent crescendo. Kick-Ass very rightly says, &#x22;I&#x27;m way in over my
head!&#x22;<br /><br />In contrast, Hit-Girl seems to be a character deliberately used to test
the threshold for bad influence. The actress seemed far too young for
the role. She even drops the C-bomb! She reminds me of Puss in Boots
manipulating people by acting angelic then suddenly becoming a
merciless but skillful assassin.<br /><br />It&#x27;s great to see Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Red Mist, McLovin etc.) in
this role and a very different Mark Strong (Mob-boss Frank) compared to
Vaughn&#x27;s other brilliant film, &#x27;Stardust&#x27;. I think this film is very
well directed and I love the way the plot played with my expectations
many times. That was thoroughly enthralling!<br /><br />Also, I liked the intertextuality (film references) to other superhero
movies like Spider-Man, X-Men and Nick Cage being similar to Batman.<br /><br />I think a 15 rating is OK but slightly pushing it. There are a few
torture scenes including a particularly unpleasant one towards the end.
But the film is still brilliant and I&#x27;m looking forward to the sequel.
Fortunately, the area I live in doesn&#x27;t need a super-hero as it&#x27;s
relatively peaceful. But I believe Kick-Ass when he says, everyone&#x27;s
fantasized about being a superhero. I&#x27;m not ashamed to admit that I
have. However, this film proves that you don&#x27;t need to be a mutant to
be a super-hero. You just need to be a good character.
