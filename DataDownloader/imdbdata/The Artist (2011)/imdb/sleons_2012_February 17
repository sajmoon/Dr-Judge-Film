This is by far the greatest movie of the year. I want to be a film
maker and I can say that I felt absolutely jealous of the creator of
this feature after watching it. The use of sound is magnificent. Jean
Dujardin is a fantastic actor. And the story is so well written I cried
through out the hole movie. It is a tribute to film in its purest form.
When film language began there wasn&#x27;t any sound and I&#x27;ve always thought
image is the most elegant way to tell a story. Soap operas relate on
dialogue to tell you what&#x27;s going on, and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve always
thought their story telling is vulgar. This is the opposite side of the
spectrum. I believe you should see this film even if you think that a
&#x22;silent&#x22; and black and white film isn&#x27;t interesting. You won&#x27;t be
disappointed. It&#x27;s funny, engaging, deep, meaningful and subtle.
