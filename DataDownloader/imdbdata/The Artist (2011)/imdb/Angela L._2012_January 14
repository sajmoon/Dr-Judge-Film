I&#x27;m 14 and i went to see this with my best friend.... we were a little
unsure if we should see it or not because of it being a silent movie.
It turned out to be amazing &#x26; we both agreed on this....however you
have to appreciate old films and the movie/show business to be of our
age and see this movie.<br /><br />It somewhat requires patience and you have to be willing to sit through
an hour and a half long movie with only music. This film was very
different and does require concentration, however we found it to be
somewhat humorous at times! <br /><br />hope this was helpful (:
