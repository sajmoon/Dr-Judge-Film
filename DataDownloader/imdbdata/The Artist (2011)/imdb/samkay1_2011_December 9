I was a little bit timid going in to The Artist, fearing that a PG
rated hundred minute silent movie might be soapy and sentimental. I was
very impressed to find that this is not the case. The Artist is a film
about simple relationships, and that&#x27;s its strength, simplicity. We
begin in the year 1927. George Valentin; a charismatic silent movie
star is very fond of the new member of his latest cast, Peppy Miller.
She is very fond of him too, but they go separate ways with the arrival
of talking pictures. George refuses to take part in such pictures,
while Peppy embraces it and goes on to become a super star, leaving
George in the shadows. But does this mean she has forgotten him?<br /><br />I think what keeps the movie from being cartoony is that The Artist
could have easily been played as a romance, but it chooses not to.
George and Peppy are presented as friends not lovers. The movies that
are featured within the movie have all the soap and sentiment, but this
one is played serious. It does have it&#x27;s effective moments of comedy
though. The best the Artist, even as a silent movie, never feels
overdone.<br /><br />Most of the time, The Artist is actually a rather sad movie. A good
portion of it is focused on George&#x27;s low point in life, spent brooding,
low on cash, and unable to make a successful film. The two leads carry
the film, beautifully. Director Michael Hazanavicious trusts his actors
completely. He chooses to let the camera linger on their faces rather
than break up the scenes with to many caption cards. In fact there is
more dialogue spoken and inaudible in the Artist than there is
captioned dialogue. The plot is presented accessible to a fairly
general audience while still being a maturity of subject matter; also
quite impressive. <br /><br />The Artist is shot and assembled very well, and looks like something
that was made eighty years ago. One item worth noting is of course how
early movies have far more static frames than moving ones, as stedicams
and shoulder camera-work would not be in vogue il the mid- late
twentieth century. Even for a mostly static picture, there are some
great shots and angles. I particularly enjoyed a dutch angle (diagonal)
shot of George at a table which is so polished that you can&#x27;t telling
with is the man and which is the reflection until he spills his drink.<br /><br />The ending came a little bit more abruptly than I thought. for a film
with such a long middle section I would&#x27;ve liked to an extra five to
ten minutes. the hundred minutes that made up the Artist are a
delightful throwback, with room for laughs and tears. It&#x27;s a film with
heart and soul, and even if imperfect is one of the most disticive
films of the year.
