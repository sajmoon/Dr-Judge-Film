&#x22;The Artist&#x22; orchestrates a poignant symphony of the most euphonious
silence ever sung on the big screen. Through a single, expressively
dilated smile, Jean Dujardin succeeds in conveying far more emotion
than through any other polysyllabically deafening dialogue that
perturbs our comprehension with its stentorian, verbal dissonance
echoing over the underestimated power of pure facial expression. The
evolution of the film industry and simultaneous stardom shift from an
inflexibly proud actor to a vivaciously welcoming actress are
beautifully captured through the wondrous duet of facial acrobatics
delivered by Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo. Amidst the black and
white colors from The Artist&#x27;s palette hides an even more colorful
array of ingenious artifices. To highlight, the shrewdly and
meticulously angled shots that intensify a character&#x27;s sentiments to a
far greater degree and the astounding manipulation of sound effects
that amplify George Valentin&#x27;s (Jean Dujardin) shrill looks of torment
and mellifluous smiles of content. Additionally, &#x22;The Artist&#x22; showcases
a stellar crew of performers of which even its canine constituent,
Uggy, displays an admirable feat of adorable coordination that would
make several human actors roll over with envy. Overall, &#x22;The Artist&#x22;
paints a vivid sight of colorful and vivacious, black-and-white scenes
while skillfully composing an aria of melodious silence.
