No, you probably don&#x27;t know the lead actors. Also, the whole movie is
in black and white, and there&#x27;s hardly any dialogue. But I beg you,
give this movie a chance, or I just flat out don&#x27;t want to see you
anymore! With early Oscar buzz and highly acclaimed reviews, &#x22;The
Artist&#x22; is a black-and-white silent movie about a silent movie star,
and his fall from fame. Now, out of all the movies in 2011, &#x22;The
Artist&#x22; is one of the most hilarious, enjoying, and breathtaking
movie-going experiences of this or any other year. Jean Dujardin
totally deserves a Best Actor win, stealing the whole show for his work
as George Valentin, a silent movie actor during the 1920s silent era of
Hollywood, with his trusted companion, a hilarious puppy. Seriously,
that dog has his best laughs in the entire film, and he&#x27;s one of the
best animal actors ever seen on screen. Then, he meets the gorgeous
Berenice Bejo as Peppy Miller, a big fan who soon takes over Hollywood
by storm, leaving George on the far sidelines. James Cromwell is also
really brilliant as George&#x27;s ever-loyal valet who is always there for
George, even in his tightest situations. John Goodman is awesome as the
studio boss, who tells George that &#x22;talkies&#x22; are going to take over the
new future of cinema. With the talkies being introduced, and the silent
movies are disappearing, George&#x27;s career disappears as well, and loses
all his popularity rapidly. All I need to say is that I&#x27;ve never had
this much fun watching a movie in a long, long time. I enjoyed every
single moment in this movie, from beginning to end. This is a unique
and different movie-going experience, and it felt like watching a film
in the 1920s. The casting ensemble is breathtakingly brilliant, and
they didn&#x27;t need to say anything. I was blown away by the sight of this
movie. The addition of using the black-and-white detail, and the silent
movie style is super unique. The cinematography is amazing, the editing
is super, the music is beautiful, and the acting really carries the
movie. Written and directed brilliantly by Michel Hazanavicius, &#x22;The
Artist&#x22; is a beautifully well-made motion picture that teaches about
the age of motion pictures, the changes that new technology will make,
and how some fame can go away, just like that! So, bravo to the people
that made &#x22;The Artist&#x22;. This is one of the best movies ever made, and I
hope that this is the Best Picture winner of 2011. &#x22;The Artist&#x22;, in my
review, &#x22;a visualizing and enchanting motion picture experience&#x22;.
