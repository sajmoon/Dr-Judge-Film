The Artist was not nearly as bad or &#x22;boring&#x22; as certain IMDb viewers
have reported, with their paltry 1-star ratings. Having said that, this
movie leaned too heavily on the easy tricks that convince an audience
to swoon. Bound up in its reliance on romanticism, the core plot was
traditional and safe. And the adorable mutt (Uggie) who always seems to
save the day (with his cuteness) helped to boost the likability factor.<br /><br />What can I say? It&#x27;s the feel good movie of the year. But this does not
a great film make. The Academy members recently elevated it to their
top Oscar choice. Their vote was unsurprising, but disappointing.<br /><br />Regarding the charming actor Dujardin, whose eyebrows do little dances
all their own, I would like to see more of him--in another context. The
natural grace and talent of Bejo were lovely, but she and Dujardin did
more than their fair share of hamming it up for the camera. <br /><br />Whenever actors try too hard to please the audience, a part of me
shrivels up inside. But the actors cannot bear total responsibility for
this. It&#x27;s the producers and the director who issued this shallow
interpretation. At times, it felt like some vaudevillian beast had
taken over the stage, and the vibe was trying too &#x22;vamn&#x22; hard.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t get me wrong. The film was pleasant enough. I suppose I&#x27;m glad it
inspired many people. But, I was not so easily convinced. After
witnessing the likes of Master Chaplin, I&#x27;m afraid that many others
will pale in comparison.
