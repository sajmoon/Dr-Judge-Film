2011_December 20 
It&#x27;s a wonderful period piece but if you&#x27;re going to take on a genre
that includes the history of a particular medium...you better know your
stuff. or at least hire people who do. i&#x27;m no expert, mind you but even
i noticed flaws in the art direction. you rarely see silent films or
even films made in the 40&#x27;s &#x26; 50&#x27;s where decorators used shades on
sconces &#x26; chandeliers. also in the climax of the film when the 2 leads
are tap dancing...you only hear the tapping of one dancer! a HUGE
mistake...HUGE. it&#x27;s an amateur who made that decision...hoping no one
will notice. another moment that ripped me from the illusion of the
period was: you never saw a married couple in bed together even before
the code. if you&#x27;re going to make a &#x22;silent film&#x22; and base it on the
silent films of the late 20&#x27;s and early 30&#x27;s...do your homework. i also
thought the ending was contrived and naive.<br /><br />AND the only African American representations in the film are a zulu
tribe! please...there were many, MANY African American ACTORS who
contributed greatly. <br /><br />BUT still go see it, at least he tried!!!
