Don&#x27;t miss it! Maybe one of the most impressive films in a long time,
especially for the courage it took to back an idea like this. &#x22;Peppy&#x22;
is the tops, cute, energetic, very talented, and just the right actress
for the part. I hope to see more of her soon, and the old Hollywood
pros do right by the locals too. If you thought this was going to be
all silent you are in for a treat as the music was also one of the
highlights and will be appreciated by any silent film fan. The story
line is simple, but perfect for this film. Hopefully, some who see this
will search out some of the better silents to understand better what
launched the most important art form in human history. More! More!
