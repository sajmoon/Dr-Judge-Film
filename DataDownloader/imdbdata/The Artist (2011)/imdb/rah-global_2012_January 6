A perfect score for a classic film. <br /><br />Given the risks taken (the largely b/w and silent elements to the film,
for a start) I&#x27;m really impressed that it was made at all. Set in the
era of silent movies but on the cusp of radical change, Hazanavicius
has unravelled a tight story with playfulness and pathos; based around
the rise of one star&#x27;s career and decline of another&#x27;s. <br /><br />Rarely present in films, both leads show genuine star quality with
compelling chemistry drawing them together as circumstances and pride
conspire to keep them apart. Over the years I&#x27;ve resisted leaving a
review on IMDb but have eventually succumbed here, believing that this
film deserves to enjoy the success of its many virtues. &#x27;The Artist&#x27;
has the rudiments of a solid, classic film &#x96; a well-paced, empathetic
and evolving plot, characters with likable personalities and an
interesting, brave medium in relating the story. This film has a lot to
say and does so in style.<br /><br />If you love going to the cinema then please see this movie but if you
don&#x27;t like films much then this may change your disposition...I hope it
will delight and move you as much as I. Long live storytelling!
