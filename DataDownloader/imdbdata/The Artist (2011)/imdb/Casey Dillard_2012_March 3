I very much enjoyed this movie. If it was an imperfect movie, it was
equally as charming. The pacing never seemed to lag and though the
story has been told before it was handled in some imaginative new ways.<br /><br />Though a silent film, some of the scenes were clearly heavily inspired
by Welles (the scene when they are watching the first clips of a movie
in sound is very reminiscent of the newsreel scene in Kane and the
breakfast sequence was an almost shot for shot copy of the dinner
scene). I was very enchanted with the complicated relationship between
Peppy and George.<br /><br />Dujardin is a gift to silent film. His easy smile and somewhat Clark
Gable-like charm keep George likable even as he spirals into
depression, despair and ego-fueled meltdown. Bejo brings an energy and
liveliness that is a credit to her. It&#x27;s easy to see why he would both
admire and resent her.<br /><br />All that said, the story is actually a short one. With different
direction and different actors, it would have been a sluggish movie
indeed. There comes a point when it seems like they could have put more
effort into the characters than just showing George lose more and more
to the changing times.<br /><br />Still, it is made up for by an inspired dream sequence and one
thrilling dance number. These were the moments that truly made the film
for me. It won&#x27;t be for everyone, but I&#x27;d encourage anyone to give it a
try.
