One of movies behind any definition. Like a unique picture. As a lake
in winter. History and love story and presence of Schiller. An
extraordinary director and memorable scenes. And the feeling than this
tale , who may be about Elizabeth the I or Boudicca has not end. It is
a huge exercise of perfection and beauty in each moment. A kind of
spell and form of sculpture. So, it is not movie of a time. And it is
not example of artistic precise art. But it is memory. Recollection.
Subject of nostalgic moment and bone of a way to give the essence of a
subject. This film is Hollywood. And more. The details constructs a
world strange and dramatic but like sculptural roots. A extraordinary
show. A wonderful husk for a new type of seed. And one of greatest
movies.
