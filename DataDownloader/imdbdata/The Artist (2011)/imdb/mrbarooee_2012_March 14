Of course it needs huge amounts of courage to make a silent movie
nowadays but does only this really deserves an Oscar? Well the movie
has nothing new to offer. The same stuff we had seen in the 20s and no
innovation. Nothing new in the story or the performance which it seems
that actors back in 1920s were much more talented and attractive. It
doesn&#x27;t have the freshness of the original silent movies. Everything
seems fake. We are completely aware that that the have &#x22; made&#x22; a silent
movie. they couldn&#x27;t convince us to believe it was a silent movie. All
the efforts of the actors seems unoriginal. Well we expect much more
from a movie which promises a lot of originality but as there is no
smile of freshness on you face.It is all the same stuff!
