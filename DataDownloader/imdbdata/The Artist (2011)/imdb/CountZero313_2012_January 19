A movie star finds his life falling apart when a technological
innovation, &#x27;The Talkies&#x27;, arrives, and the old is swept out to make
way for the new. However, salvation is potentially there, in the form
of a young star who feels she owes a debt (and feels so much more), if
only the star of the silent screen could let go of his pride...<br /><br />You don&#x27;t have to look far for films that document the cataclysmic
effects of the arrival of sound to silent film - Sunset Boulevard, and
Signing in the Rain, to name two genre-opposed examples. Stripping a
film of dialogue is also not that rare - consider Daratt. And utilizing
the retro feel of black-and-white in the modern age is pass&#xE9; since Ed
Wood and Schindler&#x27;s List. What is rare, possibly unique, is the
combination of these elements to create a film that taps into the
current desire for nostalgia and feel-good cinema.<br /><br />Jean Dujardin shines as George Valentin, giving a masterful pastiche of
the eyebrow-dominant mode of acting of 1920s screen heart-throbs. His
charismatic performance most skillfully evokes the period. B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice
Bejo as the aptly named Peppy Miller poses, grins, winks and melts
hearts while holding the pain of an unrequited love for the unwitting
George. The directing perfectly complements the theme - George
encounters Peppy first on equal footing, later when he is in his
ascendancy, and then a bit later on stairs, framed in starkly
geometrical terms, with a chastened George making his way down, and an
effervescent Peppy going all the way up. They talk, with her occupying
the elevated position.<br /><br />&#x22;I will not talk!&#x22; proclaims the opening title card, and the narrative
never lets up in its exploration of this essential thematic strand.
George won&#x27;t/can&#x27;t talk to his wife, Peppy and George never talk about
their attraction, George refuses to talk on screen, his closest
companion is a gesture-reliant dog...<br /><br />I have seen this in the cinema on three occasions and each time the
audience have applauded at the end. Whether this is a reflection of the
quality of the film, and/or the desperate need in our times for
nostalgia and uplifting cinema, I do not know. There is something about
this film that touches people. A homage to cinema, and an unashamed
crowd-pleaser (perhaps the only thing that gives away the fact that the
film is French), The Artist is quite simply a triumph. I am not sure if
it will last the test of time, but harrumphing about it now would be
churlish. Well-crafted, great fun, worthy of the tears you will
undoubtedly shed, I recommend it unreservedly.
