This movie is absolutely exceptional, even though the plot and the fact
that it was black/white and silent was not very appealing to me( I am
male, 25) &#x22;the artist&#x22; is a wonderful movie that brought me to tears.<br /><br />The good thing about the fact that the movie is silent is that it makes
you keep your eyes on the screen because you are forced to read the
actors emotions from their faces. (sometimes you have to lip-read too!)<br /><br />I have never watched a movie with Jean Dujardin or B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo, but I
am definitely going to look at what else they did, they did a fantastic
job and John Goodman should be nominated for best supporting actor.<br /><br />The story was great, the music and the acting was absolutely amazing!<br /><br />Must See!!!
