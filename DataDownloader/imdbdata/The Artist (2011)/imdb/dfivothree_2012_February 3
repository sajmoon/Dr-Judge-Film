2012_February 3 
What can I say: I enjoyed it a lot.<br /><br />I&#x27;ve seen a fair number of silent movies: old silent films with updated
soundtracks (Metropolis, Man With A Movie Camera); new silent films
with live accompaniment(Koyaanisqatsi... &#x22;silent&#x22; probably isn&#x27;t the
word.) <br /><br />Some people do not think The Artist is very original. By this they mean
they would rather have seen the dog clamp his jaws to the heroine&#x27;s
throat, or defecate on the stage, or something equally original and
symbolic as that. Probably they think the dialogue was a bit weak
also...<br /><br />My only fear on going to this movie was realized: the girl sitting
behind me took the opportunity during a quiet part of the film to
fumble around with a candy wrapper. She couldn&#x27;t wait for the
soundtrack to resume. Perhaps she did not think the film was very
original either.<br /><br />The music was fine. The photography was rich. The clich&#xE9;s were
refreshed.<br /><br />Would I recommend this film? &#x22;Witz plezure!&#x22;
