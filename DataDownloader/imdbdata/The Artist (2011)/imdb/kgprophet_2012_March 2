Audiences of late are being educated about life in the early part of
last century with the very layered &#x22;Boardwalk Empire&#x22;. Moreso, the
scripting and characters are intricate and have a complexity that
modern audiences expect in intelligent filmmaking these days. Here
comes &#x22;The Artist&#x22;, a very simplistic and unadventurous throwback film.
But really, even back then filmmaking was capable of complexity, like
&#x22;It Happened One Night&#x22;. Frankly, the story was so clich&#xE9; and clunky,
it felt like a film student&#x27;s first screenplay. And the production was
no more impressive than a stylised episode of &#x22;Moonlighting&#x22;.<br /><br />I have been a fan of Michel Hazanavicius and Jean Dujardin&#x27;s James Bond
spoofs. And I expect great things ahead for both of them. I am
certainly convinced that they will make better films than this, one
that really might deserve an Oscar. This is not a bad film, but
&#x22;Citizen Kane&#x22; it is not. It really does not break any new ground, has
slow character development, and the script at points felt repetitious.
Although the photography adhered to 20&#x27;s techniques, still some
creativity could have been welcomed. Black and white photography can be
stunningly beautiful. This film shows little flair despite being a bold
period piece.<br /><br />So what is left is the music, and there is nothing either disappointing
or epic about the soundtrack. Again, for such a film to draw attention
to a different place and time, only to model itself as the cookie
cutter film establishment circa 1920&#x27;s, loses it&#x27;s chance to add nuance
and complexity. &#x22;Boardwalk Empire&#x22; injects timely cultural nuance,
along with the limitations and different mindsets of a less
sophisticated time. Perhaps some reference to the silent comedy stars
that suffered a similar fate (Charlie Chaplin was a silent film legend,
but his comedy could not translate into talkies). In general, this film
had a lot live up to when I walked into the theatre after winning so
many accolades. There was nothing unique to this compared to other
throwback films. It is not innovative in any way. They could have
injected more subtle humour and less dog tricks (Disney has the silly
dog film market covered). A bad Coen brothers film is better than this.
I was surprised how little meat there was on the bone after sitting
through it. Certainly a film like &#x22;The Tree of Life&#x22; is a more
memorable film from 2012. Heck, &#x22;Moneyball&#x22; has a more intricacies to
it and it&#x27;s a baseball film. I am truly sorry I could not get into this
film, and I will probably be considered someone who can&#x27;t appreciate
small art-house films. It depends, a small film with a great script
will standout. This small film without a great script does not.
