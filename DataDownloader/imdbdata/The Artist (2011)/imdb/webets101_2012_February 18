This movie is tremendously entertaining. Goosebumps from start to
finish. As soon as the movie ended, I could watch it again.<br /><br />However, I would like to comment on one particular aspect not mentioned
in most reviews. This is a monumental and ground breaking achievement
in the art of film-making and cinematography. I bet that from now on,
this movie will be included in the lists of top-50 or top-100 movies of
all time, and that all future filmmakers will study how this movie was
made.<br /><br />For example, in this mostly silent movie, I could actually hear the
dialog by reading the lips, as the actors spoke and brilliantly
expressed their parts when the movie was filmed. Judging by light and
shade complexity, this black and white movie was filmed in color using
high ISO and high resolution equipment, and colors were converted to
gray-scale B&#x26;W separately and differently, allowing the viewer to guess
colors on the B&#x26;W screen.<br /><br />Next week we will find out whether it will win the Oscars. I predict it
will sweep the Oscars winning Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor,
and Best Original Screenplay. Even though we may never know the actual
Academy Awards voting tally, chances are, &#x22;The Artist&#x22; will win by the
widest voting margin since &#x22;The English Patient&#x22;.
