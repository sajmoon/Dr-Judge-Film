I didn&#x27;t think that this was anywhere NEAR as good as most of the
critics and award-givers think it is. Yes it is well crafted and the
attention to detail is excellent But the plot is boring and while the
acting was over the top as you would expect it to be I thought it was
too far over- with the exception of the remarkable James Cromwell who
gave his usual stellar understated performance.( BTW watch out for a
brilliant little cameo from Joel Murray as the policeman.) But why the
dog??? - yup super cute and a great little performer - but why would a
movie star have a dog like that? I got the impression that someone saw
Uggie perform somewhere and decided that he just had to be tacked on to
a movie. Nope sorry guys - this movie is not for me and was extremely
disappointing
