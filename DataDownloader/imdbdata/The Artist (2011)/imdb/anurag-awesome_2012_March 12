The Artist is a story about silent movie star George Valentin(Jean
Dujardin). When the era of silent movies end, Valentin is worried
whether he&#x27;ll lose his popularity in the new era of movies. Whereas
Peppy Miller(Berenice Bejo), an aspiring dancer is on the verge of a
big break. I really loved the idea of making a silent movie after all
these years. The story of the movie was really emotional &#x26; touching.
You really feel sad for George Valentin when people lose interest in
his silent movies. However, the movie was a bit dragging in the middle.
Jean Dujardin has done a spectacular job in his portrayal of George
Valentin. Berenice Bejo is impressive as Peppy Miller. The supporting
actors have done a good job as well. So, I would like to conclude by
saying, The Artist is worth a watch. Is it Oscar worthy? Not really.
