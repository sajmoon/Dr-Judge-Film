The artist is a smartly crafted tribute to movies from the silent era.
Everything from the sets, to hair and outfits to the overly exaggerated
expressions, to even the late 20s mentality brought us back to movies
from that time period. The actors expertly emphasized the over the top
emotions which are needed since verbal expression is not possible. The
as minimal as possible shots of written words to convey a statement, as
was done in silent films from the past, was a fun aspect that showed
how minor a role words actually play in order to convey a story by
film.<br /><br />It was a nice tribute and it excellently mocked those old silent movies
however The Artist is not a classic as those old silent films are. I
think when a silent film is revisited it is not so much for its
entertainment value but rather for its value as a classic as a art form
in its infancy, perhaps to get a sense of the time period or perhaps to
touch on film history by witnessing legendary actors or filmmakers. It
was impossible for The Artist to achieve this level or any level of
nostalgic classic nor will it since it is a contemporary parody.<br /><br />As a silent film and as a mimic of those old silent films it had a
cumbersome pacing at times. It was rather light hearted and didn&#x27;t have
as much as that interesting psychological dark edge as other similar
stories that explored a Hollywood star that is once on top, loses it
all and is no longer relevant has; think Sunset Boulevard. There were
also much more entertaining movies made about the advent of talkies and
the impact it had on actors from the time period, think Singing in the
Rain.<br /><br />The Artist is mildly entertaining, with a premise that felt revisited.
It was a comfortable tribute that expertly recreated films from the
1920s.
