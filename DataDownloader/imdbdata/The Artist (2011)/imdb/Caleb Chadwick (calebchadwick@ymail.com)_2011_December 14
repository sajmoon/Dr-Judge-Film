Going into this film , I did have high expectations. What I learned
coming out of it is that, I do believe, I have grown a bit as a critic.
This being of the highest praised films of the year, I had no doubts
that I would come out of it liking it somewhat at least. This being
said, I was mostly let down here. Another thing this film taught me is
that trailers for films can be deceiving and that literally most of the
great parts of a film are within it&#x27;s trailers. This is mostly the case
here. I found the most enjoyable moments were parts of snip-its from
pieces in the trailer. If you have not yet seen the trailer for this
film, I recommend against watching it. The story here, overall, is
actually quite bland and nothing to really get excited for. This is a
pretty easy film to swallow, and there is really only one scene in the
film that really gives it anything worthy of a PG-13 rating. You could
say this is almost a family film for the easy minded, and for some, it
could be something anyone could enjoy if you are into the more
independent films of course.<br /><br />However, despite all this, the performances is what really saves the
film here, and they are spot on, and in every way worthy of an Oscar
nom. from at least the 2 leads or just the female lead overall. Also,
the cinematography is quite gorgeous to look at for the most part. I
can&#x27;t really say that what IS here is really flawed at all, it just
really didn&#x27;t grab me and have all the magic most are claiming it to
have. There is something here, but it is missing a lot of charm it
could have had. What we get here is splices of charm with a downtrodden
face.
