I don&#x27;t think I have seen a single negative thing written about this
film, so going into the theater, it is fair to say that I had high
expectations.<br /><br />&#x22;The Artist&#x22; fulfilled all of them. The acting is fantastic, reminding
us that body movements and twitches can convey a great deal of emotion.
George Valentin&#x27;s (Jean Dujardin) expression and posture slowly change
as his life falls apart, helping the viewer feel what he is going
through viscerally. Pippyy Miller&#x27;s (B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo) smile conveys spunk
and charm in a way that many actors cannot with large chunks of
dialogue at their disposal. John Goodman portrays an incredibly
stereotypical business-oriented Hollywood director brilliantly, his
comical frustrations supplying much of the comedy present in this
movie.<br /><br />From a cinematographic point of view, &#x22;The Artist&#x22; is stunning as well.
Memorable shot after memorable shot showed up on the screen, whether it
be a couple of fictional native Indians appearing on a bar counter to
harass our protagonist, a suit fitting a reflection of him wonderfully,
or a screen separating our destined tap dancers. The director, Michael
Hazanavicius, also plays with sound wonderfully, with a lovely
soundtrack providing plenty of audio-stimulation. However, in the
climactic scene, there is absolute silence, actually provoking
surprisingly strong emotions in the viewer. The last scene is
absolutely brilliant on a number of levels, but I will not mention it
here because it is worth experiencing without being told what happens.<br /><br />But as well done as these two elements are, it is conceptually where
this movie excels. &#x22;The Artist&#x22; tells the story of the change from
silent films to &#x22;talkies&#x22;, and the difficulties it could cause to some
of Hollywood&#x27;s past stars. It&#x27;s key message seems to be: &#x22;Go with the
flow&#x22;. Pride and vanity will leave you by the wayside, and in the case
of our principal character, suicidal. It is ironic (and certainly not
accidental) that this is a silent movie about the transition to ones
with talking, and it uses a great mix of 1920&#x27;s style scenes with ones
that are undoubtedly modern and current, showing that the movie itself
is not afraid to do what is new or unexpected (and then, of course, it
is funny that a black and white silent movie is totally out of the
mainstream now).<br /><br />My only gripe would be that the all-knowing dog is relied upon too
much. I understand that it is an exaggerated character designed to
emulate similar plot devices from the time period, but although it
works greatly as a sidekick, when it takes over the action, its charm
wears off.<br /><br />This was a pretty poorly conceived review, but it includes all of my
basic ideas about &#x22;The Artist&#x22;. Go see it for yourself!
