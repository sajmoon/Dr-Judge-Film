The Academy of Motion Pictures ran a film series (here in L.A.) earlier
this year, of some of histories best silent films. If the film I saw
tonight, The Artist, had been released (yet) this film surely would
have made the list. This is one of the most charming, funny, sweet,
clever movies I have seen in years. Everything about this movie works
and is executed to perfection. Due to the fact that I actually watched
several silent films on the big screen earlier this year, I can say
this film looks straight out of the 1920&#x27;s and is one of the best
reminder&#x27;s of why America fell in love with the movies.<br /><br />The Artist opens in 1927, to a packed movie theater enjoying another
silent Hollywood film premiere. As the credits end, its star George
Valentin (played by Jean Dujardin in a sure- fire Oscar nomination for
Best Actor),who is strikingly similar to Douglas Fairbanks, walks onto
the theaters&#x27; stage. Considering the man never udders a word throughout
the whole film, it sounds funny to say I think he will get an Oscar
nomination in the Best Actor category, but I do! And yup, I think The
Artist&#x27;s stunning leading lady Berenice Bejo will probably get
nominated for her portrayal of Hollywood&#x27;s favorite &#x22;talkie&#x22; star Peppy
Miller. Peppy Miller (Bejo), an aspiring Hollywood actress, bumps into
star George Valentin (Dujardin) leaving the opening film premiere, and
there relationship continues over the nest several years. As his career
fades with the silent film era, her career grows with the &#x22;talkies&#x22;.
There is delightful cast of characters peppered throughout the movie,
played by actors such as James Cromwell, John Goodman, Penelope Ann
Miller, Missi Pyle, Ed Lauter and Malcolm McDowell. <br /><br />Do not let the fact that this film is in black and white and silent
deter you. The music is so perfectly matched to every scene, and still
authentic to the era. In fact, you guessed it, the music is so good I
am sure that it will be nominated for Music (original score). And while
i am predicting this films chances at the 2012 Oscars, adding to what I
have already mentioned, I expect it to also get nominations for Art
Direction, Cinematography, Costume Design, Directing, Film Editing,
Makeup and Writing (original screenplay). This is a film that can&#x27;t be
given justice with description, it must be scene on the big screen. Go
see The Artist and get transported back to a different era, and enjoy
old Hollywood as you probably never have, or will again...
