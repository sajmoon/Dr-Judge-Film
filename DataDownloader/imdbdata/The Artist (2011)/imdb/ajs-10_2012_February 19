Very well made with a beautiful musical score by Ludovic Bource, it
really set the tone and held the film together brilliantly. I found
this film a breath of fresh air; it took me back to Saturday morning TV
when they used to show the odd silent movie. A simple love story with
some great acting and a brilliant musical score really hit the mark
(for me). I did find, though, that George&#x27;s decline went on a little
too long, just when you thought he&#x27;d hit bottom there was a little
further to go. But that&#x27;s the only criticism I have, it&#x27;s beautifully
made in the style of the time and, although it may not be for everyone,
it&#x27;s still one I have no problem in deeming&#x85; Recommended.<br /><br />My score: 8.6/10.<br /><br />IMDb Score: 8.4/10 (based on 28,029 votes when this review was
