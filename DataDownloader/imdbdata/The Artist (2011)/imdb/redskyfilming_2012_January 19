&#x22;..with an open mind i headed into this year&#x27;s &#x27;almost cert&#x27; Oscar
movie &#x27;The Artist&#x27;. I personally had only heard bad things although i
had been told that it was receiving rave reviews. I wonder why. I love
old black and white movies, but ones with a good story. The Artist
simply took from many, many b &#x26; w movies before it and simply re-made
it. As i watched the movie unfold before me i did ask what many had
seemed to ask already...What is the point. If this does win numerous
awards at the Oscars this year then yet another remake or imitation
does it again. Yes, it is well made BUT..with the technology that the
studios have today, this would be an easy feat. Was I entertained..no
not one bit. In fact i was so desperate for some sound...which says a
lot for the movie. As i write this piece i am still wondering what on
earth was the point to all of this. Was it a way of ribbing the current
film industry. Was it a just trying to be clever. Was it trying to be
different (and do we need that). What was it trying to achieve. Those
who give it high praise must be seeing something i am certainly not
seeing. Those sad geeks out there that spot the &#x27;references&#x27;...good
luck to you. All i spotted was a nice imitation of what has already
been and gone...and done much better than this attempt. 2/10 (for
effort) TV is proving a far more powerful medium than the movies these
days-Great Expectations, Boardwalk Empire, Downton Abbey, Treme, The
Hour etc etc p.s. I did notice a dog doing tricks, the same ones
performed at the Golden Globes. Now THAT&#x27;S ENTERTAINMENT or is it.
