The Artist is a compelling homage to the silent movies. It is not the
kind of movie that will please all crowds. I liked it because I am a
fan of movies and found valid the attempt of the producers in making a
silent movie. The story line is quite silly, but delivers some goods.<br /><br />The actors are so good, mainly the duo Dujardin/Bejo, both can express
the gestures and expressions of the silent era. I agree with all the
awards the film has been getting recently. I&#x27;m not sure it will get the
Oscar for best picture, but I&#x27;m pretty certain that Jean Dujardin will
get the statuette. I recommend this film for everybody.<br /><br />INn a Nutshell: The Artist is a worthy seeing picture because it has a
good story and a good cast. It&#x27;s a black and white movie and it is
silent because it pays homage to the 1920&#x27;s movies.
