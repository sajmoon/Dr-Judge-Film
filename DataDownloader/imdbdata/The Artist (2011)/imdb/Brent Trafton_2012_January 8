&#x22;The Artist&#x22; is more of a novelty than a film. The fact that it is
silent didn&#x27;t bother me as much as the predictable story, hammy acting,
and 16mm square format film. It&#x27;s not a bad film but I didn&#x27;t feel it
was worth all the rave reviews and I certainly don&#x27;t feel it should be
a contender for Best Picture.<br /><br />The story is very predictable. I always felt I was 2 steps ahead of the
script and I was bored for much of the film. I wish the cinematography
had been a little fancier to offset the lack of sound. It didn&#x27;t look
like it was shot in real black and white. It looked like it was shot in
color and transferred to black and white which gives it a muddy look.
The music was pretty good. My favorite character was the dog.<br /><br />If you want to see a good silent film, my favorites are &#x22;The Passion of
Joan of Arc&#x22; and &#x22;City Lights.&#x22; I don&#x27;t really recommend &#x22;The Artist&#x22;
except as a novelty.
