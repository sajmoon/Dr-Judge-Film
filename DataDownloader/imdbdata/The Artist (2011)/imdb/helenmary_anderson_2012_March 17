It&#x27;s always telling when the cinema audience bursts into applause at
the end of a film, as they did when I saw The Artist. It was a joy to
watch, a lot of fun, and the time passed really quickly. Laugh out loud
funny and with pathos, with strong likable characters, it was
surprisingly more complex than I expected given the silence. I really
liked the clever touches of the old style of the credits and the
filming dimensions of the screen. The wardrobe/costumes were great too.
I&#x27;m glad the actor who played George Valentin got an Oscar - he
deserved it, I think.<br /><br />The story is of a movie star of silent films who feels he has nothing
to contribute as talkies become popular as new technology is developed,
and younger stars are becoming famous in Hollywood. The film is
interesting as a look at Hollywood in the 1920s when the Studios ruled
in the &#x22;Golden Years&#x22;. Whilst the two leading players were awesome,
with a strong supporting cast (John Goodman was great), the star of the
piece was most certainly the incredible little dog! <br /><br />I would recommend this film to anyone. Not only is it a great film,
it&#x27;s also interesting as a different cinematic experience, for novelty.
