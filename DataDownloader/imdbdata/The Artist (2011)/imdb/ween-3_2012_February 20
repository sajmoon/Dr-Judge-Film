Yeah...you can believe all the hype...It really IS that good. A movie
for people who love the movies...and this is one that you really DO
need to see in a theater, popcorn in hand. Couple of random thoughts:
1) Woody Allen and Mel Brooks are truly unindicted co-conspirators in
this project. Their work paved the way.<br /><br />2) No supporting actor nod for Uggie? Really? A darned shame. For
starters, more emotional range than Emily Proctor and Jim Belushi, and
he probably required fewer biscuits during rehearsals, and fewer takes
to get the scene.<br /><br />3) Let&#x27;s face the cold hard facts, folks. Painful as it may be, it&#x27;s
probably okay to be a patriotic American and like the French again.
C&#x27;est si bon and all that.<br /><br />4) Billy Crystal&#x27;s got it easy this year. The opening montage pretty
much writes itself, don&#x27;t it?
