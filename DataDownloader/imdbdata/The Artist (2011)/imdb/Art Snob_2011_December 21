If you can get your Weinstein-manipulated expectations WAY down from
&#x22;Oscar&#x22; to &#x22;cute gimmick,&#x22; then this cinematic truffle could very well
satisfy &#x96; especially if you&#x27;ve ever seen and enjoyed a theatrical
screening of a silent movie. There&#x27;s a faithfulness to the spirit and
techniques of the silent era that&#x27;s undeniably impressive and will
delight those few audience members (myself being one) who have enough
familiarity with silent cinema to appreciate it.<br /><br />But is it a movie that you should be running out to see because
omnipresent web advertising says that it&#x27;s an Oscar lock? Negative. If
you DON&#x27;T have the required familiarity with the silent era, the charms
and nostalgia evoked by the film will be completely lost on you, and
you&#x27;ll be far more dependent on the thin and unoriginal storyline for
entertainment. (Note: the story borrows shamelessly from both SINGING
IN THE RAIN and A STAR IS BORN and is fully consistent with the era&#x27;s
cornball aesthetic.) And even if you ARE familiar with silent cinema,
&#x22;Oscar worthy&#x22; is going to seem like a stretch. Either way, if you
really want to enjoy this movie, lowering your expectations from their
current hype-elevated levels is imperative. (Anybody notice how
remarkably similar Weinstein&#x27;s overhype campaign for this film is to
the one he successfully ran for Roberto Benigni&#x27;s LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL
years ago? Anybody watched that movie since?) <br /><br />I first saw this film at the Toronto Film Festival with a full house at
the spacious Elgin Theater, and it received a favorable albeit muted
response from the audience. (By comparison, I saw AMELIE at the same
theater ten years prior, and it received a ten-minute standing ovation
at the end.) If I&#x27;d known at the time that I&#x27;d just seen the year&#x27;s
BEST movie, I would have been depressed over what this portended for
the year-end releases.<br /><br />You simply can&#x27;t help being aware of the limitations of silent movies
-- and thankful for the quantum improvement that the introduction of
sound made -- no matter how deft the filmmakers are in recreating the
look and feel of a bygone era. It&#x27;s a movie-making era that you&#x27;re glad
IS bygone -- as evidenced by the inability of any of the gushing
critics to cite a single color talkie favorite that they wish had been
a b&#x26;w silent instead.<br /><br />I say &#x22;A&#x22; for cinematic conceit and &#x22;C&#x22; for entertainment value (&#x22;B+&#x22;
for silent film buffs).
