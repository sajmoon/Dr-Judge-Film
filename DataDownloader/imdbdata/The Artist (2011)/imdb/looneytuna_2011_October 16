As I waited for two hours in a long queue to watch this movie at the
Mumbai Film Festival, I wondered why I was doing so much for a silent
movie, of all things. Post screening, I&#x27;m ready to brave hail, rain or
the super hot Indian summer sun and stand in a serpentine queue, just
to watch this movie all over again. <br /><br />&#x27;The Artist&#x27; is sure to go down in history as a must-watch. For those
who want to study films, for those who pursue cinema relentlessly, and
also for those who just watch movies because they just like to. If
you&#x27;re wondering why a silent film, the movie not only answers it, but
makes you fall in love with the medium. it&#x27;s clearly a product of a
thinking director, where every thing in the scene has a story to tell.
Whether it&#x27;s the ironical film posters, street signs, or just a little
dog barking quietly in the corner. <br /><br />I don&#x27;t need to comment on the talents. The Best Actor award at Cannes
2011 has done that already. I will however mention the four-legged
supporting actor in the movie. Best performance I&#x27;ve ever seen so far! <br /><br />Enjoy this movie. Add it to your collection. This is one movie worth
upgrading to from DVD to Blue Ray to ...
