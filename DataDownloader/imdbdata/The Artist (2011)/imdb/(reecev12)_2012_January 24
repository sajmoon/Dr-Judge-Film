The fact that a silent movie was made is uncomprehending.perhaps the
director should have done a little research and find out that a talking
feature was made in the year 1927. Making a talking movie a few years
after that is acceptable given the price. but now that was 84 years
ago. just because a movie is silent does not mean that it is good.
following the plot of this movie was not a problem for me at all. it
was very simple. this review is not condemning the plot of the movie it
is not terrible, but its not great either. This movie is a joke and the
academy is only nominating because they are a bunch of snobs. their
decision they make for choosing movies isn&#x27;t based on what they
enjoyed. it is decided based upon what makes them smart. for instance
the academy would never chose the movie &#x22;Drive&#x22; because choosing that
would make them appear as non intellectuals. the academy and anyone who
likes this movie calling a film for the century is a snob.
