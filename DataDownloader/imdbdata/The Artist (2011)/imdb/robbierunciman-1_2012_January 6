How often to you go to a cinema on a cold January evening to watch a
film and come out feeling that all is well with the world, how often
does a cinema audience break out in spontaneous applause at the end of
film. IMHO not often enough but it happened tonight in London. This
film is brilliant, the acting, the story and the innovative way that it
was filmed. It is mostly silent but I loved the way that when sound was
used, it was effective and surprising. The old cinema and the 20&#x27;s are
depicted as they would have been in films made in the period. Its not
gritty reality like &#x22;fishtank&#x22;, nothing gets shot up, like in almost
every other film and TV show: this was a a clever, witty film aimed at
a audience with more than one brain cell - encore, more please.
