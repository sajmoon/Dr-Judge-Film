2012_January 24 
Here is a film that is so different from any other film I have ever
seen. It was made in 2011 and is black and white and silent. I love
silent films especially Charlie Chaplin(The Gold Rush,City
Lights,Modern Times,The Great Dictator) films. It&#x27;s also a great film
to show kids today to introduce them to silent films. The film is
directed by Michel Hazanavicius(La Classe americaine,OSS 117: Cairo,
Nest of Spies,OSS 117: Lost in Rio)and stars Jean Dujardin(OSS 117:
Cairo, Nest of Spies,99 francs,OSS 117: Lost in Rio) and Berenice
Bejo(A Knight&#x27;s Tale,OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies). This also has a
good chance of winning Best Picture at the Oscars.
