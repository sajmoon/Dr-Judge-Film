It&#x27;s been a long wait for this much heralded movie, the notices from
Cannes were enthusiastic to say the least and early user reviews on
IMDb have anointed it with must see status.<br /><br />So, I went along today with an open mind and a hope that it justified
its early 8.5 rating on our esteemed website. I have to say that it
doesn&#x27;t; but there is much to love in this delightful movie novelty.<br /><br />First off, this is a novelty. Once you&#x27;ve enjoyed its fare you are left
wondering &#x22;what exactly was the point of making that&#x22; because it has no
real &#x22;agenda&#x22;. I saw no political, religious or cultural allegory. What
I saw was a lovingly crafted, beautifully photographic, gorgeously
scored, excellently acted, art-house homage.<br /><br />It&#x27;s kind of a big idea but without an idea, instead it&#x27;s a film built
around executional excellence and in that respect is often near to
perfection with some lovely retro cinematographic and illusions.<br /><br />There&#x27;s a particularly nice touch when Peppy Miller&#x27;s movie opens in a
cinema called the Reine (an in joke and nod to the production company
that made it, La Petite Reine I suspect).<br /><br />I didn&#x27;t know the story before I saw it and I won&#x27;t spoil it for you
here because the story is fairly slight and not that big a deal, it&#x27;s
merely the skeleton for a series of set pieces and fun.<br /><br />It&#x27;s held together principally by the delightful Peppy Miller (Berenice
Bejo), an up and coming &#x22;talkies &#x22; star who worships the ground that
fallen idol George Valentin (surely a nod to Valentino) played
brilliantly by Jean Dujardin walks on. However many scenes are stolen
by the delightful Jack Russell terrier who is Valentin&#x27;s only constant
soul mate throughout the movie.<br /><br />There are also two good cameos from American actors John Goodman, as
the studio magnate, and James Cromwell, who you&#x27;ve seen literally
hundreds of times without perhaps realising who he is, as Valentin&#x27;s
loyal manservant.<br /><br />It&#x27;s shot in a, 1.37: 1 ratio that these days, is virtually unseen, but
was the format of choice in the 20&#x2032;s. This, for me added further
authenticity, as do the beautiful credits, captions and monochrome
photography.<br /><br />Sound is used cleverly throughout and the final scene had me grinning
from ear to ear.<br /><br />I really liked this oddball movie. No it&#x27;s not one of the greatest ever
made and I doubt will do much at The Oscars outside of the technical
categories but it&#x27;s a great hour and a half and an unusual and
worthwhile feelgood movie experience.
