&#x27;THE ARTIST&#x27;: Four Stars (Out of Five) <br /><br />2011&#x27;s &#x27;Best Picture&#x27; Oscar front-runner (as well as 9 other
nominations) and the most critically acclaimed movie of the year is
this black-and-white silent film! It stars &#x27;Best Actor&#x27; Academy Award
nominee Jean Dujardin and &#x27;Best Supporting Actress&#x27; nominee Berenice
Bejo. The film was written and directed by Berenice&#x27;s husband, &#x27;Best
Director&#x27; and &#x27;Best Original Screenplay nominee, Michel Hazanavicius. I
didn&#x27;t find the film to be quite as good as all the awards and critical
acclaim it&#x27;s received but it&#x27;s definitely a very unique and original
film going experience. <br /><br />The film is set in 1927 Hollywood during the last great days of silent
film. It focuses on one of the biggest stars of that era: (the
fictional) George Valentin (Dujardin). Valentin feels his marriage,
sanity and everything else he holds near and dear fall apart when he
starts to become a fading star from a bygone era due to the arrival of
talking films. A young rising starlet named Peppy Miller (Bejo), that
he helped give a career boost to, fondly watches over him though as he
continues to drift into destitution and madness. <br /><br />The movie is a shining example of creative art and love for cinema, in
that way I definitely admire it. It&#x27;s also an honest story of
self-indulgence, excessive pride and depression. Not the uplifting
romance some people might be expecting but a quality drama nonetheless.
The directing, art design, cinematography and acting are all
exceptional. Is it the best film of the year? Not by a long shot,
especially when movies like &#x27;WARRIOR&#x27; are out there, but a very good
film all the same.<br /><br />Watch our movie review show &#x27;MOVIE TALK&#x27; at:
