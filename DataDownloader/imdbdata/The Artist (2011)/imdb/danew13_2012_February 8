The enormous attention this film is getting is because it&#x27;s one if the
few French movies that Americans can watch...But also, with few living
people and film critics who have ever seen silent films, its almost
like a new genre being discovered.<br /><br />I can&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t enjoy The Artist, even though the plot was as old
as the Jazz Singer or Wings...But to be honest, don&#x27;t expect to see
many more of these vintage movies...in the end the market won&#x27;t support
silent movies.<br /><br />On the other hand, the international cast of Jean Dujardin, B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice
B&#xE9;jo, John Goodman did a bang up job in this new genre...silent film.
Oh, and let&#x27;s not forget the dog.
