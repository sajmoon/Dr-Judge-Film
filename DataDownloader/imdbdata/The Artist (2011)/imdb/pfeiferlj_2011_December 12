It&#x27;s rare that I go out to a theater these days to see a movie; I
usually wait for Netflix. But &#x22;The Artist&#x22; was the exception. When I
heard about this silent black &#x26; white film (with the great reviews) my
curiosity was peaked. And it surpassed my expectations. I left the
theater feeling like I&#x27;d just had a three-day weekend. This is a movie
you can trust with your emotions; it won&#x27;t let you down. I just wish it
were playing in more theaters because I wanted to buy tickets as gifts
for my family members in other cities. &#x22;The Artist&#x22; is about a silent
film actor who rejects the new technology of &#x22;talking movies&#x22; in the
late 1920s (anyone who has ever cursed a Microsoft release should
relate to his resistance to new technology; couldn&#x27;t resist). His
journey of fame, wealth, hard times, and love opens like a Christmas
present on the big screen, with a fun musical score, fine acting,
original screenplay, and -- of course -- an adorable dog.
