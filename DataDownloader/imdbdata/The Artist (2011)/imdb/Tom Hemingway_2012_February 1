&#x27;The Artist&#x27; is a pretty daring film. It has appeared almost out of
nowhere with a relatively unknown cast and director and has taken the
world by storm... And did I mention it was a silent movie? It&#x27;s already
tipped to be the big winner at the Oscars after taking best picture at
the Golden Globes earlier this year. But amidst all the hype, is it
actually any good? And can it possibly be as good as everybody says? It
turns out that it is. After a few viewings, the joy felt when watching
&#x27;The Artist&#x27; still remains. You find yourself sat watching the film
with a big grin on your face that will last for most of it&#x27;s running
time.<br /><br />Jean Dujardin plays George Valentin, the biggest movie star of the
silent period. The film follows his success in the mid-20&#x27;s and how it
turns on him and his life with the introduction of talking pictures in
1929. That is the film in a nutshell. But really, it is about the
nature of fame, ambition and the inevitable moments of reality that
face everybody in life. Jean Dujardin is perfect in his role. He is
smooth, charming, reflective and incredibly human without even saying a
word. Rather than dialogue, his facial expressions do the talking and
it&#x27;s very easy to see why he has an Oscar nomination for this role.
Watch for moments of subtle humanity beneath his celebrity exterior
when he is preparing for his roles or in a beautiful scene towards the
end of the picture which I won&#x27;t spoil for you. All the other
performances are predictably superb with Berenice Bejo and John Goodman
supplying the charm expected in old silent movies.<br /><br />Another reason the film is so captivating is in the attention to detail
with all the technical aspects. Firstly, the film is presented in the
aspect ratio all old movies were screened in, to not only capture the
essence of the time but to put greater focus on the performances of the
actors. It works. The audience will feel every bit of emotion in this
film because of it. Additionally, the music is one of the best original
soundtracks I&#x27;ve heard in a long time. The 80 plus minutes of music
from this film is almost like a character itself; a scene can be viewed
as serious or comedic just by the use of a few notes. A final factor
worth noting is the cinematography, which makes this film look like it
could have come from 1927. It is shot in beautiful black and white
which gives the film an extra texture and depth that today&#x27;s digitally
shot coloured films cannot capture.<br /><br />It is possible to write for days about &#x27;The Artist&#x27; but all that needs
to be said is how moving, beautiful, joyful and brilliant it is. For a
film to come out as daring as &#x27;The Artist&#x27; in 2012 and be only half
decent is a good result. However, it does much more than that. It
captures the essence of cinema itself with it&#x27;s ability to entertain,
surprise and engage audiences all over the world, myself included.<br /><br />A Classic.
