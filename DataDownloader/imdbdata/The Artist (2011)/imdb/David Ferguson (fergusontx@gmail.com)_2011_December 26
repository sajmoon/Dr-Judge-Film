Greetings again from the darkness. Remember the last silent film that
received this much adoration, acclaim and publicity? Of course you
don&#x27;t. It was 1927 and Clara Bow starred in &#x22;Wings&#x22;, the most recent
silent film to be nominated for Best Picture (it won). My guess is,
that streak is about to end thanks to French writer/director Michel
Hazanavicius.<br /><br />No doubt many will avoid this one since it is a Black &#x26; White silent
film. What a mistake that would be. It offers a wonderfully
entertaining and captivating story, and two outstanding and expressive
lead performances. Jean Dujardin is remarkable as George Valentin, one
of the biggest movie stars in 1927 (when this story begins). It&#x27;s
around this time when the &#x22;talkies&#x22; begin taking over. Valentin is a
very likable character, but foolishly believes talking movies are a fad
and his fans will remain loyal to him and his traditional silent films.
Not only do talkies take off, but the Great Depression also hits.
Valentin finds himself out of work and broke.<br /><br />The most fun in the film occurs when Valentin and Peppy Miller
(Berenice Bejo) are together. Their characters have a chance meeting
and there is an instant spark. Valentin gets her the first break of her
career and before long, she is on the rise as fast as he free falls.
Only Valentin&#x27;s dog and driver (James Cromwell) remain loyal to him
during the tough times, but Peppy refuses to let the bond die.<br /><br />It&#x27;s impossible to watch this film and not notice the influence of
&#x22;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&#x22; and &#x22;Sunset Blvd&#x22;. Also, Dujardin&#x27;s Valentin
looks to be a cross between Douglas Fairbanks and Gene Kelly, replete
with the electric matin&#xE9;e idol smile. Both Dujrardin and Ms. Bejo (who
is the director&#x27;s real life girlfriend) have the elastic face and
bright eyes necessary for silent film stardom. They really allow us as
viewers to forget the silence and enjoy the characters.<br /><br />This is a fully realized story with excellent character development.
You might wonder how this is possible with no dialogue, but that&#x27;s why
this is a must see film garnering an abundance of critical acclaim.
It&#x27;s very easy to access and is purely entertaining ... with both
moments of happiness and sadness. It has everything a really good movie
should have ... just with fewer lines of dialogue!
