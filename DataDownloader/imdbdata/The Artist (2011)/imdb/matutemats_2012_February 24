I can&#x27;t believe it. Just can&#x27;t.<br /><br />I started to see this movie with extremely low expectations, and was
complaining about &#x22;how can a silent, black and white movie can be
nominated for best picture, whilst other great films are left apart
(well, not so much great films, the descendants was the worst movie
I&#x27;ve ever saw in my life)&#x22;. <br /><br />Well, I was wrong. Jean Dujardin fits perfectly for the role, and he&#x27;s
acting was excellent. He displayed his character at %100.<br /><br />Other thing I was scared about. The script. I was terrified that the
script would be just too &#x22;slow and old style&#x22; like a 1930&#x27;s movie would
be. Wrong. Great Script! When you are expecting an obvious situation
during the film, there is a twister, which continuous to gasp
attention. <br /><br />B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo isn&#x27;t of such recognition of this review (although she is
Argentine, as me) but still does a fine job, although she is a
socialist. I would expect from her to donate all her Oscar and revenue
money for the &#x22;communist cause&#x22;. <br /><br />Nevertheless: Jean+Good Script+Curiosity for being just a 2011 silent,
black and white film = An emotional film that gets to the bottom of
your soul.
