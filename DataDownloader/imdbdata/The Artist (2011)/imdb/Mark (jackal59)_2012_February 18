Why are people gushing over this? It is nothing but a barely competent
collection of the clich&#xE9;s that people think of when they think of a
&#x22;silent movie&#x22; but really are ones that mark third-rate commercial
entertainment, which this is. It&#x27;s thin, it&#x27;s badly acted, and it&#x27;s
*wrongly* shot. If you&#x27;re going to ape your betters (which in this case
would include Pabst, von Stroheim, Murnau, Lubitsch, and Chaplin), then
you should have the decency to study what they do and try to imitate
their style. <br /><br />This is crap. I&#x27;d like to believe the acclaim for it is a joke, but I
fear it&#x27;s not. I guess people don&#x27;t watch things like &#x22;City Lights&#x22; any
more and don&#x27;t recognize this for the pandering garbage it is. And it
*is* pandering; never for one frame do you get the feeling that these
people don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re archly &#x22;slumming&#x22; and being &#x22;edgy&#x22; by
shooting without sound despite the fact that their vision is utterly
pedestrian and probably wouldn&#x27;t have made it off the second bill in
1928.<br /><br />Oh, and they use &#x22;Pennies from Heaven&#x22; with no awareness whatsoever of
its resonance. I hope Dennis Potter comes back from the great beyond
and smacks them on the head.
