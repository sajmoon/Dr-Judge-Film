This movie is a gem. Bravo to the French, their movie industry is alive
and kicking, and French people actually go and watch French films, not
only US blockbusters with lots of CGI and special effects. I&#x27;m not
French, but I like the guts of men like the producer and director of
&#x22;The Artist&#x22; to embark on the adventure of making a silent b&#x26;w movie in
these 3D times... Of course, with a lead actor as versatile as Jean
Dujardin, they couldn&#x27;t go wrong. That guy began as a stand-up
comedian, went on to star in a very successful sitcom, then created a
hilariously funny character called &#x22;Brice de Nice&#x22;, a parody of a
wannabe &#x22;surfer&#x22; beachboy with bleached hair (no way you can surf in
the calm bay of Nice...). Director Hasanavicius, co-star Berenice Bejo
and Dujardin then teamed up for the first time in two funny and
anarchic spy spoofs, &#x22;OSS 117&#x22;. And now this global success for the
Artist - I&#x27;m sure neither director, producer nor stars would ever have
dreamt to scoop up ALL the great movie awards. But they did, and
rightly so. And in the midst of all this hype, they remain nice and
modest. I was amazed (and happy) that the Academy in Hollywood
recognized the quality of this film - just such a pity that on the
message board, there&#x27;s so much anti-French venom. Chacun &#xE0; son gout,
but one should leave politics (and nationalism) alone and just lean
back and enjoy a charming peace of good entertainment.
