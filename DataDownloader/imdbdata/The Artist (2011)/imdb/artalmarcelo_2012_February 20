The Artist isn&#x27;t an homage to old movies, as you may read or hear
around. The Artist is considerably more than that, and it&#x27;s brand new.
The Artist is creativity in its maximum expression, going all the way
through from screen writing, directing and acting, since the very first
minute to the last. The script is really fantastic and the director&#x27;s
vision of how to put that script down to images is even better. In a
movie where there are no dialogs, every scene is crucial, and the
director seems to understand that. Emotions are so well transmitted
through the screen to the audience, that it really makes us think if
dialog is fundamental in movie making. Well, the answer is no, when the
execution is so perfect, but this is top notch movie making and
especially top notch acting, which is probably the main feature of the
whole film. The actors in this movie are so expressive that they don&#x27;t
need to talk to make you understand. You&#x27;ll understand by only
watching. You will laugh and you will cry, but more than anything,
you&#x27;ll probably love this movie, just as much as I did.
