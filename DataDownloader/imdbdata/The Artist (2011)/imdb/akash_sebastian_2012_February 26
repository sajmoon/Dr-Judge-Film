Brilliant and courageous!! Courageous - because in this 21st Century
with CGI effects, color, 3-D and wide screen available, who would
attempt to make a black-and-white silent movie? It&#x27;s mainly the result
of the amazing direction, terrific acting, well-synchronized background
score and Jean Dujardin&#x27;s irresistible smile. And hats off to the dog!<br /><br />It takes you to the silent-movie era where the effect and feel of the
movie wholly depended on the expressive actors and the music (given by
the live orchestra, in the theatre itself). Well, this is the first
silent movie I&#x27;ve seen and I truly loved it! It has humour, drama,
romance, everything... Makes you wonder, how you sat through the whole
movie without hearing a single dialogue.<br /><br />The movie basically shows the transition from silent movie to talkies
era - something similar to &#x22;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&#x22;... &#x22;Singin&#x27; in the
Rain&#x22; was basically a musical with colour, sound, dance and
everything... I&#x27;m not comparing this movie to that. &#x22;Singin&#x27; in the
Rain&#x22; will remain a timeless musical classic. But &#x27;The Artist&#x27; has good
character depth and many other unique characteristics.<br /><br />This movie is for people like me who love Cinema!
