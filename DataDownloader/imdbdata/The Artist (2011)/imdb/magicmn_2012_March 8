100% masterpiece best Oscar winner for last decade. If academy didn&#x27;t
choose it was fail for academy but nothing for this movie.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t wanna analyze it here. Just watch it and you wouldn&#x27;t stay cold
cause this move is almost perfect in any aspect - cinematography,
acting, soundtrack. Its amazing cause its black and white and almost
silent excluding music and at same time its full of self irony but
thats real good irony means humor without any real sarcasm behind it. <br /><br />But most of all its harmonic composition of both ideas and form what is
amazing in only such thing may be called Art. So i think that any real
movie fan must see it at leas once.<br /><br />This movie is timeless like Filinni&#x27;s best pictures.
