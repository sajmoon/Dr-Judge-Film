I doubt as a reviewer I can say anything about this movie that hasn&#x27;t
already been said&#x85;but as a filmmaker who has written and produced a
film on the silent film era (Madcap Mabel) I can say plenty, starting
with the sub-title to The Artist should be &#x22;Is Great&#x22;. For starters,
what the film does best is not overplay its concept. It is a silent
film but it doesn&#x27;t hit us over the head by playing to the public&#x27;s
general perception of what those films entailed. For instance, title
cards and music are used sparingly and not as clich&#xE9; devices catering
to what people not familiar with the genre (in other words&#x85;the majority
of the movie going audience) would expect to see. This not only gives
one an appreciation for not being catered or dumbed down to, but allows
the actors to truly earn their keep by &#x22;acting&#x22;.<br /><br />The story is simple but classic&#x85;after helping young starlet &#x22;Peppy
Miller&#x22; (the name fits the character), movie idol &#x22;George Valentin&#x22;
(the last name perhaps an homage to silent great Rudolph) falls on hard
times and when the now famous actress he&#x27;s helped tries to return the
favor, his pride becomes his biggest demon. OK, we&#x27;ve seen this when
James Mason&#x27;s alcoholic binges destroyed him after making Judy Garland
the title character in the classic A Star is Born. However, setting
this theme in the silent movie era, using the advent of sound as the
impetus which led to the title character&#x27;s downfall (fueled of course
by a drug more dangerous to an actor than alcohol&#x85;&#x22;ego&#x22;) was both
ingenious and historically accurate as many a silent film star&#x27;s career
disappeared when sound first emerged from their mouths (as another
classic, Singin&#x27; in The Rain, could attest).<br /><br />The film&#x27;s structure moves everything at a great pace. We see actor
Valentin&#x27;s subtle downfall from fame equally balanced with starlet
Miller&#x27;s rise and again without the usual clich&#xE9;s. The cinematography
is as sharp as any classic black &#x26; white film and the few lines we do
read from title cards are witty and clever. Finally, the ending which I
will not give away, brings everything full circle.<br /><br />Director Michel Hazanavicius should be applauded for not only
attempting the risk of making a silent film about silent films in this
day and age, but for writing a screenplay which not only brings
together such classic themes, but doing it in ways that cleverly
highlight the film&#x27;s genre by using its silent limitations. I not only
smell Oscar nomination here&#x85;but maybe Oscar itself.<br /><br />Speaking of Oscar&#x85;lead Actor Jean Dujardin should also be getting an
early phone call on nomination day for his portrayal of the egotistical
yet always classy fading star. As for lead Actress Berenice Bejo&#x85;she
does the impossible by letting her natural beauty come second to her
natural acting. Her performance combines comedy, tragedy and genuine
emotion and one can&#x27;t help wonder how great she would have been as an
actual actress from that era. Her large expressive eyes which make one
melt with every blink speak volumes&#x85;which although an oxy-moron when
discussing silent film is certainly true in this case. Her scene with a
coat rack is hysterically-romantic and if the Academy gave an award for
&#x22;Cute Dancing&#x22;, her &#x22;Charleston&#x22; would be win hands&#x85;or should I say
&#x22;feet&#x22; down. In good supporting roles are Penelope Ann Miller as
Valentin&#x27;s long suffering wife &#x22;Doris&#x22;, James Cromwell as his chauffeur
/assistant &#x22;Clifton&#x22; and John Goodman as the blustery studio head &#x22;Al
Zimmer&#x22; (another good name). And for all you pet lovers&#x85;yes, Valentin
has a very talented dog that fills those &#x22;awwwww&#x22; moments.<br /><br />The films only fault maybe it could put acting schools and teachers out
of business for all aspiring thespians need do to learn the true craft
of their vocation is to watch the heartfelt, well written and well
directed performances in The Artist. As a silent movie buff I Iook at
this film as a love letter to that bygone era and hope and expect it
will renew and create interest in classic silent movies and silent
movie stars. As a writer, producer, actor and general movie lover
myself I give it as many stars as the talkies destroyed. In fact, I&#x27;ve
already put in my pre-order on Amazon for the DVD, the insert of which
I&#x27;m sure will feature the words &#x22;Academy Award Winner&#x22;.
