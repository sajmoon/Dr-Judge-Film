Wow, I never expected to see a movie at this level in our times. There
is a huge quantity of work and brain behind, they tried to meet
perfection in any detail and they have succeeded. This is a movie &#x27;pour
les connaisseurs&#x27;. Certainly this is one of the best movies that I saw
in the last year. You&#x27;ll have the opportunity to see all the American
clich&#xE9; of 20&#x27;s elevated at the rang of art in a very smart manner and
as a bonus, you&#x27;ll have a heart touch in a natural way. This is a movie
which really deserve to spend your time in front of your TV, even if
your not passionate by this art. If you&#x27;re not familiar with
black&#x26;white mute movies, give It 20 minutes from your time at the
beginning and you&#x27;ll understand after why I recommended to be patient.
