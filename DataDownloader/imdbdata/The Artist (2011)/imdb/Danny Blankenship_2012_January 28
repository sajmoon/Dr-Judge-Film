If you have studied film history or follow the movies then you know how
it all started long before the days, of special effects, graphics,
digital work and heck even before talk their was the silent picture!
And this film &#x22;The Artist&#x22; captures those times just perfect it
showcased that thru the 1920&#x27;s even though that motion picture was
silent still yet, we had our movie stars, tabloid drama, gossip, set
struggles, and people enjoyed the movies all before it would change
over to a talking picture! Set in 1927 Hollywood, &#x22;The Artist&#x22; follows
the path of screen star the big silent picture king himself George
Valentin(Jean Dujardin)who after making picture after picture meets an
up and coming want to be actress in the graceful and attractive Peppy
Miller(good turn by Berenice Bejo)and this little lady has a love for
dance. As with times and culture changes come even to pictures and by
the end of the decade George&#x27;s worst nightmare has came true the
talking picture has been introduced.<br /><br />Slowly George fades from sight and goes into a deep depression, on the
opposite side Peppy is everyone&#x27;s favorite screen star with her dance
moves and it helps as she has agreed to talk. Only this turns to an
emotional journey of love and dealing with struggles of change as with
dance moves and words combined with love George and Peppy come together
to make the perfect picture! Overall near excellent film that&#x27;s
historical and a tribute to old classic film that highlights themes of
change, emotions, love, and happiness so well in a classic traditional
way.
