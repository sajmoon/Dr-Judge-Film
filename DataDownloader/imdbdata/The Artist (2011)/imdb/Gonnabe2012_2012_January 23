Its hard to rate a movie like the artist. I loved the directing and the
pace of the film. I loved that it was shot in black and white and that
it looked like a period movie. But then of course it is not a period
movie. It is a 2011 movie and yet I can&#x27;t compare it to any 2011
movies. That is not of course bad. You can always compare it to the
1911 movies. Against the 1911 movies this one looks like a cute
fairytale. It is almost pretty woman in the 20s. It could be written on
the back of a handkerchief but it could also be a true one. A Hollywood
star of the silent movies comes against Talking movies. For some
unexplained reason &#x96;because he is not mute, he is afraid of the talking
pictures. At the same time, a girl he helped became an actress, is not
afraid of talking pictures and becomes a star. I really felt for the
dog. For some reason and I am firm to that, I can&#x27;t give credit to the
actors. Based on the fact that this movie is made as a 20&#x27;s black and
white picture with no sound, even though creative, I can&#x27;t say that the
actors impressed me. Again of course it has to do with what you compare
the movie. But personally I found them over-dramatic and trying too
hard. I guess that is what the movies looked like at the time and you
have to help your audience understand their emotions through their
faces since there is no dialogue. But I simple can&#x27;t ignore the fact
that this acting was almost bad acting. I give it 5/10. Maybe I am a
little harsh against the film but I always am when I hear &#x22;masterpiece&#x22;
from the media and I don&#x27;t find one.
