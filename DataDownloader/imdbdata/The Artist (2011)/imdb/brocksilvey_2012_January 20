This light-footed and -hearted souffl&#xE9; of a movie is a reminder of just
how much fun it can be to go to the movies.<br /><br />A film about a silent film star struggling with the transition to
talkies that is itself a silent film is the kind of cutesy high concept
premise that could go down in flames in the hands of the wrong team.
But writer/director Michel Hazanivicius and his stars, Jean Dujardin
and Berenice Bejo, know exactly how to sell the material so that it all
works beautifully. What I liked most about the movie is that it doesn&#x27;t
spend all of its time winking to itself for its own cleverness, as you
might expect it would. It doesn&#x27;t use its silent film conventions to
make any kind of commentary on silent films. Hazanivicius and company
wanted to make a silent film because they thought it was the best way
to tell this particular story, and that&#x27;s just what they&#x27;ve done,
without apologies.<br /><br />Dujardin and Bejo are being lauded for their performances, and rightly
so. It would be easy to dismiss their work as being unchallenging, but
I have a feeling both had more difficult roles than one might first
assume, and that the fact that they both make it look so easy is part
of why they&#x27;re so good. And the movie looks stunning -- one of the
benefits of it being silent is that with words removed from the
equation, the images take on extra responsibility to communicate the
movie&#x27;s ideas to us, and what cinephile could resist anything that
makes a film more cinematic? <br /><br />This film and &#x22;The Tree of Life&#x22; both for the moment stand at the top
of my list of favorite films of 2011, and it&#x27;s interesting to me that
both are examples of films that let pictures rather than words tell
their stories.<br /><br />Grade: A
