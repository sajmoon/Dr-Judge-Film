Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland Thank God for
new ideas! With aspects of sound films such as &#x22;Singing in the Rain&#x22;
and &#x22;Citizen Kane&#x22;, as well as almost every silent film I ever saw in
film school, &#x22;The Artist&#x22; is a silent film inexplicably released in
2011; and a modern masterpiece to boot. Without audible dialogue
director Michel Hazanavivius creates a visual feast for the senses,
merging his vision with a stellar soundtrack, which navigates the
viewer through a whirlwind of emotions, just as a more
conventional/modern sound-film would. &#x22;The Artist&#x22; tells the very
intriguing story of George Valentin, played by Jean Dajardin, an actor
with the charisma of a Rudolph Valentino, but with an attitude that
rivals Chaplin. In 1927 Valentin stands as the biggest star of the
Hollywood silent era, making countless films with his sidekick, a
happy-go-lucky dog. But with the emergence of the talkie (the talking
picture), and many younger actors, specifically a young actress named
Peppy Miller, played by Berenice Bejo, Valentin fears that he will not
be able to (and frankly doesn&#x27;t want to) make the transition into a
future dominated by sound films. Hazanvivius has constructed a very
entertaining as well as historically accurate storyline, all while
paying homage to the groundbreaking era in which this story takes
place. Using old fashioned wipes and cuts, he allows the audiences
(even some who haven&#x27;t seen silent films) to experience a slice of film
history (the silent era) as it should be experienced; in a more or less
silent format. And in this day and age, where the Hollywood formula
seems to be either an abundance of explosions, which destroy the senses
and/or sexually irresponsible teenagers being moralistically
decapitated, &#x22;The Artist&#x22; demonstrates a refreshing acknowledgement of
how movies can be fun again with some simple yet visually breathtaking
storytelling. This is very much cinema at its richest. What can I say?
&#x22;The Artist&#x22; made me smile.<br /><br />&#x22;The Artist&#x22; is a silent film about silent films; that is not entirely
silent. BUT how these rare introductions of sound are interwoven into
the story demonstrates a real stroke of genius from Hazanavivius. In
fact, there are many broad strokes of genius at play during &#x22;The
Artist&#x22;, from the director&#x27;s intricate attention to detail, in terms of
the striking look of his cinematic vision, to the actors who all give
performances of a lifetime. Everybody is perfectly cast (yes, even John
Goodman, who is only in the movie for a short period). In fact, it
would be very difficult find better lead actors in 2011 than Dujardin,
who is polarizing as the once prolific Valentin, and Bejo who is
phenomenal as the strong rising star/love interest Peppy Miller. Both
show off their strong acting skills as they play necessarily
overdramatized and flawed characters, without resorting to campiness.
Furthermore, if there was a best supporting animal performance, the dog
in &#x22;The Artist&#x22; would be sure to win. And if the dog is worthy of an
award, shouldn&#x27;t that be the truest sign of a great ensemble cast?
Final Thought: Please don&#x27;t disregard &#x22;The Artist&#x22; just because you
heard that it is a silent film. This film breaks down every
generational or genre barrier known to man. This is a comedy with
genuine laughs, a tragedy with genuine tears and a drama that is a
monumental achievement in modem cinema. I don&#x27;t get to say this much,
in a year filled with failed Adam Sandler productions, but this film is
damn near flawless. And while &#x22;The Artist&#x22; may not be my favorite film
of the year, it is damn near close, and would not surprise me if it won
for Best Picture at the Oscars, as well as best director and best lead
actor. Did I just say that?! But need I say more? Please visit my page
