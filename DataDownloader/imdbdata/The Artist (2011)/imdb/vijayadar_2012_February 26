There is a great b &#x26; w film of the 50&#x27;s in Hindi titled &#x22;Kagaz Ke
Phool&#x22;. It was directed by the legendary Guru Dutt, and starred the
director himself and Waheeda Rehman. Those who have seen this film will
immediately notice how much The Artist owes to Guru Dutt. Even Dutt&#x27;s
film was inspired by Chaplin&#x27;s Limelight. So I fail to see why there is
so much noise about a silent film that is different from the two films
I have mentioned in only an absence of sound. Kagaz Ke Phool had
outstanding camera work by V. K. Murthy, who explored light and shade
as had never been done before or since. I am quite certain that the
director of The Artist is familiar with Guru Dutt and Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s
works. He would have enhanced his reputation had he acknowledged his
debt to these two greats of cinema.
