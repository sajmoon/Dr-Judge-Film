I wanted to see this movie so bad, because I really liked Dujardin in
previous movies I&#x27;ve seen, because of the idea of seeing a silent
movie, and the trailer really conquered me. When I sat in the theatre
watching the first minutes, I was immediately taken in; the way
Hazanavicius plays with the fact that this is a silent movie might be
its most interesting and fun aspect. It is well-done, beautifully
acted, and superb to watch. My only complaint, but it&#x27;s still a rather
serious one, is that after you&#x27;ve seen the trailer, there&#x27;s really not
a whole not more to learn from the movie. You&#x27;ve seen the whole story,
or pretty much. That disappointed me; I was hoping to be more surprised
by it. It did not happen. However, I would definitely see it again just
to enjoy the cinematography, the acting, the subtle humour, and the
whole ambiance of the silent, black and white movie. It&#x27;s worth seeing,
even if at the end the story felt a little thin and clich&#xE9;.
