The Artist has been an awards favorite for some time. It&#x27;s a silent
film in the way of 1920&#x27;s cinema, so what&#x27;s there not to like about it?
It&#x27;s a very simple film, but all the more glorious because of it.<br /><br />The film is essentially about a silent film star who starts fading into
oblivion when the &#x22;talkies&#x22; start taking over. On the other end, he
forms a friendship with an upbeat and cheerful Hollywood-hopeful, who
starts becoming the new big thing. Even though the film has been
critically praised, I&#x27;ve heard some criticisms about this film. I&#x27;ve
heard some critics call it too light, too simple to be anything
incredible or meaningful. Some even call this a gimmick in some sort. I
had some reservations because of that, but I couldn&#x27;t disagree more.
The film may have a simple plot with a simple arc, but it&#x27;s directed
with incredible energy and talent. I never once looked away, and no
other film this year has made me as happy or had me smiling as much as
this. It&#x27;s not just because of how happy it is, but it&#x27;s such an
amazing technical achievement. The art direction is fantastic, and the
cinematography even experimental at times. The music is amazing, and it
had me grasped in it&#x27;s ever-changing tone and melody. <br /><br />The entire supporting cast is great, but it&#x27;s the two lead characters
who hold our attention. Bejo is charming and quite loving, but the real
star here is Jean Dujardin. He commands the screen with his changing
facial expressions and the pitch in which he performs. I haven&#x27;t seen
someone as charismatic in a very long time, and he has delivered what
is the best male performance of the year. <br /><br />Believe the hype. I sort of expect some sort of inevitable backlash by
some people for a film like this winning major awards, but it is quite
simply, one of the best of the year. This is why we go to the movies!
