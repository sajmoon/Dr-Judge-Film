Oh my! I&#x27;m going to ruin the ending to my own review by saying I
absolutely loved this film! No suspense or skirting around the issue,
it&#x27;s absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />From the offset, I was transported into a time I wish I&#x27;d lived. The
theatre was so busy, I had to sit at the back where I could here the
projector, which only added to the ambiance. The irony of a silent film
documenting the coming of sound is perfect. Sound in film is all we
know of today, lest we forget, it ruined a lot of people&#x27;s careers
(Norma Desmond, even though she&#x27;s a character, is a prime example).
Single scenes show the transition of two peoples entire emotions and
it&#x27;s done beautifully, not rushed, just beautiful.<br /><br />I really have nothing bad to say about this film, I&#x27;m giddy just
writing about. Not having sound (or even the way they use it in doses)
helps you to appreciate the subtleties. Jean Dujardin and B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo
are sublime, I even loved the dog. If only films like this could come
along more often than a blue moon.
