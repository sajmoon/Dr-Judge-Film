You know that one single film you just can&#x27;t EVER forget about... Well,
this is mine.<br /><br />Back in the summer, when I first saw the trailer, I was so astonished
by it, I knew the moment I find a showing, the minute I&#x27;d run down to
the nearest theater and watch it. However, I never did find any
showings near my home. At least until this week, when they were showing
it for one last day in town. So my father had accompanied me all the
way to the only theater it was showing it in, and I shelled out $19 for
the both of us.<br /><br />And oh....my......goodness. This was, without a doubt, the best film of
the CENTURY. I was just downright filled with happiness after the end.
Everything about this film was just right! The writing, the designing,
the editing, the ACTING (even, and especially, from the dog!) This was
definitely worth the super-expensive tickets! I recommend this film to
anyone who either A) Loves an excellent theater experience, B) Loves
movies in general, or C) hates movies (yes, I mean it)<br /><br />I have no doubts that, with all hope, this will nab Best Picture of the
Year!
