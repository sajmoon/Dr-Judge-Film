I really don&#x27;t get it. My wife and I went to see The Artist this past
Saturday and I was left with an overwhelming feeling of &#x22;meh.&#x22; Which is
really surprising, given the almost universal, glowing praise this film
has been getting--what with Golden Globe awards and Oscar nominations,
etc (not to mention all the 10-star reviews here on IMDb).<br /><br />I just didn&#x27;t see anything special here. I mean, they filmmakers did a
fairly good job of recreating a silent film, but they didn&#x27;t take it
any further than that. The plot, acting, etc, was no better or worse
than a real silent film. I&#x27;ve seen many much, much better silent films
on TCM&#x27;s Silent Sundays each weekend. Those who are gushing over this
movie have apparently not seen very many real silent films from the
20s. If they had, I think they&#x27;d have found this film kind of a &#x22;been
there, seen that&#x22; kind of experience as I did. Or maybe this
Artist-Praise-Hysteria is mostly the result of folks desperately
wanting to jump onto the bandwagon of the newest &#x22;cool&#x22; thing.<br /><br />The thing that bothered me most (besides the stretches of tedium) was
that the cinematography was distractingly flat and gray--there were no
real blacks and no real whites. I understand from articles I&#x27;ve read
that this low-contrast, glowy B&#x26;W was intentional. But I didn&#x27;t like
it. Just looked like it was poorly shot with a bad video camera with
the contrast turned all the way down. (this wasn&#x27;t helped by the fact
that the theatre I saw it in now presents all their &#x22;films&#x22; via digital
projection--a process that, in my opinion, has NOT been perfected yet
and is still too &#x22;low res&#x22; for cinema).<br /><br />All in all, &#x22;The Artist&#x22; should be nothing more than a minor, vaguely
interesting experiment that would have had a better home on video. How
it has become an indie sensation with Oscar nominations is a totally
mysterious to me. Wonder how much money it took to convince us all that
is was a masterpiece?
