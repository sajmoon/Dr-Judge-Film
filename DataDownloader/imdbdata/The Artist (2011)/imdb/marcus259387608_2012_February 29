The Artist came as a film that I had pretty neutral expectations going
into, despite it&#x27;s positive reception I still wondered simply from a
personal point of view how it could sustain itself. I was pleased with
how it played out. It plays out in quite a quick fashion and certainly
isn&#x27;t slowly paced, this was perhaps recognised by the film makers as a
silent film perhaps may be bemoaned if its pacing wasn&#x27;t up to scratch.
When I say this I mean once I knew the plot I was surprised as to how
quickly the pace got going. This was a genius move as it made for a
film which didn&#x27;t lag. In this we see George Valentin wonder if the
arrival of talking films will cause his downfall. There is a great
sense of his attitudes and as the film continues we really feel for
him, while at the same time becoming immersed in Peppy Miller&#x27;s story.
We of course see much of hers in the form of montages which I didn&#x27;t
mind as despite the overall brisk running time she along with our other
lead was developed, at the same time enjoying seeing her rise to fame.
The two leads were a joy to watch, from Valentin&#x27;s point of view we see
his willing ignorance to the threat of &#x27;talkies&#x27; without the aid of
audible dialogue we see him kidding himself and the inevitable decline.
On the other hand it could be said it made for a predictable outcome,
once you know the plot you know how much is going to play out. However
the film had a great amount of heart and was brilliantly acted without
despite predictability wasn&#x27;t too clich&#xE9;d, hammy or melodramatic. I
always think once the audience is routing for the characters the film
makers are at least somewhat succeeding and it was more than the case
here. Personally I thought they would fill it with a larger cast but
was pleased when it was kept to a premium as well as the run time. It
made the pacing stronger and kept my great interest in the story
itself. To summarise it is a treat, something different and well worth
watching for if nothing else great performances.
