2012_January 30 
I just saw this film and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I was
surprised that a black-and-white movie could captivate and affect me so
much. Ironically, the fact that it wasn&#x27;t a color talkie with modern
special effects actually helped me to pay attention to the wonderful
film; the score/soundtrack (best soundtrack, in my opinion, since I saw
&#x22;Fantasia&#x22; back in the seventies), the facial expressions and bodily
movements, and the absence of speaking &#x22;spoke&#x22; to my emotions rather
than to my intellect. Sometimes modern technology, including color, and
language distract me; they also seem to enable bad acting and imbecilic
plots. The acting in &#x22;The Artist&#x22; was superb (I especially enjoined the
leading man&#x27;s and leading lady&#x27;s performances), the costumes were
authentic (I loved the fact that men actually dressed up and wore ties
to the movies), the vehicles were works of art (rather than the plastic
bubbles we drive today); I felt nostalgic for a time when class and
compassion reigned supreme.
