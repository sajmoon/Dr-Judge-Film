I hate to be a party-pooper but for me this is not the greatest movie
of recent times. Yes, it&#x27;s charming, even beguiling - and it&#x27;s got the
most appealing dog in cinema history! - but it&#x27;s kind of slow and kind
of, dare I say, not very original. One man&#x27;s &#x22;hommage&#x22; is another man&#x27;s
piracy: SINGIN&#x27; IN THE RAIN, A STAR IS BORN and SUNSET BOULEVARD are a
bit too strongly &#x22;tributed&#x22;. Berenice Bejo&#x27;s Peppy has an androgynous
quality that reminded me of Jack Lemmon&#x27;s Daphne in SOME LIKE IT HOT!<br /><br />The scene where George has a nightmare with actual sound is
surprisingly disturbing, and it&#x27;s easy to guess there will be another
sound scene towards the end. For me the lack of dialogue - and the
period Muzakal score - became more than a bit monotonous. It might have
worked better if George&#x27;s scenes had been the only silent ones, with
Peppy&#x27;s and the studio scenes having sound.<br /><br />The acting - with its &#x22;hammy&#x22; evocation of the silent era - is
brilliant, as is the direction and the cinematography. Uggie the
tricksy Jack Russell is so cute you want to take him home with you -
but I wish I liked the film more.
