Curious...two films in a same year which make a tribute to the origins
of cinema. I liked Hugo pretty much, but I think The Artist is a highly
superior movie, because its overflowing charm fascinated me from the
very beginning and provoked a constant smile on me, until leading to a
magnificent ending.<br /><br />The first thing which draws the attention in The Artist is the fact
that it was filmed like if it was really done in the late 20s or early
30s, in black and white, without sound and with a musical accompaniment
in order to accentuate the emotions from the scenes (oh, and I also
have to mention the interstitial banners with selected dialogs from the
characters). So, The Artist could be grouped into the modern tendency
of &#x22;retro&#x22; cinema; however, the truth is that the anachronistic style
of The Artist is not a gimmick (like it has been in many movies), but
an essential part of the narrative, so as a consequence, the shape
enriches the substance, and vice-versa, telling the story with a big
ingenuity and an obvious love for that incipient period of cinema, when
the formulas we can find nowadays were forged.<br /><br />Director and screenwriter Michel Hazanavicius made a brilliant work at
capturing the atmosphere, rhythm and texture of mute cinema. I would
also like to mention the special effects, which are deceptively
invisible but indispensable in order to bring the Hollywood from that
period to life. As for performances, Jean Dujardin and B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo
bring wonderful works, reaching that exact point of theatrical
exaggeration and intimate detail the best actors from that period
possessed. We tend to watch old films almost like involuntary comedies,
full of apparatus expressions and excessive melodrama, but the actors
were testing the limits of the new medium, and their best exponents
(such as Buster Keaton, Lillian Gish and Lon Chaney) discovered the
balance which was perfectly captured by Dujardin and Bejo.<br /><br />The screenplay from The Artist is perfectly written, and it even
includes some ingenious implementations of clich&#xE9;s which end up taking
an unexpected twist. In conclusion, The Artist is absolutely worthy of
applause and a very enthusiastic recommendation, because to the
aficionados of classic cinema, it will be a great nostalgic experience,
and to the modern generations, it will be an extraordinary and hugely
entertaining History lesson, which is much funnier and more emotive
than any book about the cinema of the period portrayed in here.
