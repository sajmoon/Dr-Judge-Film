2012_February 26 
I wonder if this is a film that&#x27;s winning people over with an
absolutely storming final 20 minutes rather than being wholly all that
special. Cos, to be perfectly honest, much of the rest of it is
watching a very cute dog acting everyone else off the screen.<br /><br />I did like it, it&#x27;s certainly the best of the 9 Oscar contenders, but I
think it&#x27;s perhaps more a feat of derring do than an actual great film.
I can&#x27;t help but admire it a bit more than like it. It&#x27;s all very
admirably spartan, making a film in 2012 with about 50 lines of
dialogue that emotionally engaging.<br /><br />But great? Mm..maybe not.
