I think Hollywood has lost it&#x27;s collective mind by giving a best
picture Oscar to a black and white mostly silent movie in the 1.33 to 1
format. There is a reason movies started to move away from that format
in the 1930s - IT IS BORING and is like looking at TV dramas from the
50s. What has happened here is that the Hollywood elite and the critics
and not real movie goers have gotten all caught up in the artistry of
making an old time movie today. Aside from the technical issues, the
story itself is just barely interesting and can&#x27;t keep your attention
thru the whole movie. Do yourself a favor and save your money. If you
must see this picture wait until it is on TCM at 4 in the morning in 5
or so years where they play all the old silent movies almost no one
watches.
