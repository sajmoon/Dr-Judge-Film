I love this film. It&#x27;s just as simple as that. But I&#x27;ll explain why I
found it to be so enchanting and perfect. I loved how they handled the
subject of the rise of the talkies, despite the fact this film is a
silent film....If I told you how that would be a spoiler for you. Jean
Dujardin (George Valentin) and Berenice Bejo (Peppy Miller)had an
amazing chemistry on screen. They really stole the show. But what has
to be credited and ofter overlooked is that the fact they only are
allowed to capture the audiences attention for about an hour and forty
minutes with expression and movements only, no dialogue. That is
impressive and not once did I find myself falling asleep, because the
enthusiasm of Jean and the sweetness and jolly manner of Berenice was
so enjoyable to watch and you know what the say, actions speak louder
than words. Of course the dog, Uggie, was beyond brilliant. The music
of course was also the star of the film, the music alongside the
actions of the actors is vital in terms of trying to convey certain
emotions across to the audience. It was so beautiful and perfect for
what was taking place within the film. Don&#x27;t let the fact it is a
silent film put you off, because it is so much fun and it is so lively
that you can&#x27;t stop smiling throughout the whole film. The film meets
up to the critical acclaim this masterpiece has received, it does not
disappoint.
