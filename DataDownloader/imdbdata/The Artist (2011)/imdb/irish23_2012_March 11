If you&#x27;re a fan of old movies, or even if you&#x27;ve been afraid of being
put off by them, &#x22;The Artist&#x22; is a great way to ease yourself into the
medium. The size of the screen, the typefaces, the quality of film, the
gestures, all the graphic design, the sweeping score, the dazzling
acting -- all of it is pure vintage Hollywood.<br /><br />The lead&#x27;s smile is pure Gene Kelly but his style is absolute Douglas
Fairbanks, Jr. Tremendous style and panache. Poppy isn&#x27;t nearly so true
to the art form (I was disappointed to see that no woman bit the back
of her hand, the standard indication of horror, surprise, or shock in
the silents!) but is still winning as George&#x27;s true love. <br /><br />The picture is primarily delightfully comic, with even a terrier-like
dog reminiscent of Asta from the &#x22;Thin Man&#x22; movies, but has elements of
pathos borrowed from &#x22;A Star is Born.&#x22; The story bogged down a bit
about two-thirds of the way through, but quickly got back on track with
driving energy reaching a wonderful finale.<br /><br />My last point is merely a comment on what a treat it was to go to the
movies and not be jolted in my seat by the sound of explosions or
experience sensory overload with special effects. This picture is easy
on the senses and sweet on the heart. Give it a try.
