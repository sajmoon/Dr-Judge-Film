The talk of Tinseltown right now is critical darling The Artist &#x96; a
black and white silent film charting a black and white silent film
star&#x27;s struggle with the &#x27;talkie&#x27; phase that hits Hollywood in 1929.
It&#x27;s a lovingly made picture by French writer-director Michel
Hazanavicius and is unsurprisingly attracting huge Oscar buzz. However,
putting aside the undeniable nostalgic value it holds for cineastes, is
it actually entertaining? Well, yes, although not quite as much as the
rumour mill would have you believe. The opening act is breathlessly
exciting and the middle segment holds its own &#x96; a nightmare sequence
which features some sound design is a highlight &#x96; but the laboriously
repetitive final 30-40 minutes is a real slog. Jean Dujardin is
fantastic in the title role that will surely see the flood gates open
for his career and, like the audiences within the movie, I was
awestruck by B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo&#x27;s young starlet Peppy Miller. A must see for
film buffs.
