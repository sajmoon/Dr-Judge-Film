Thank you Michel Hazanavicius for creating such a beautiful and genius
film.. It&#x27;s always refreshing to go to the cinema and be able to
experience a new piece of art, instead of the usual guns and explosions
and sex. It&#x27;s pure talent when an actor or actress can portray a
message to the audience with no dialogue, but just with brilliant
background music, and of course.. real acting! It&#x27;s movies like this
that prove you don&#x27;t need any special effects, or CGI, or explosions to
capture an audience... simplicity is key to this film and Michel plays
with the concept of the silent movie era going onto talking so
perfectly. Not to mention, there is an adorable dog with more talent
than most Hollywood movie stars nowadays. The cinema was packed with
old people, middle aged people, teenagers, and even children! And
everyone just came out with a smile on their face. 10/10 for simple
brilliance!
