When people hear of a black and white silent film produced and starring
French actors American audiences go running for the hills. Haven&#x27;t we
moved into the 21st century? Are we not at an age where million dollar
explosions and masked do-gooders gallivant across the screen in full
fledged 3D? Why then would someone be as esoterically pretentious as to
make a film like &#x22;The Artist.&#x22; <br /><br />Because its freakin&#x27; awesome that&#x27;s why! OK...Let me rein in some of my
enthusiasm. The tale begins with silent film star George Valentin (Jean
Dujardin) on top of his game at Kinograph Studios. By chance he bumps
into a would-be actress (Berenice Bejo) and helps her break into the
business. But as 1929 rolls in, the invention of talking pictures
derails George&#x27;s career and threatens to destroy his life.<br /><br />The story is as familiar as a piece of chocolate cake yet it is told in
such an innovative way. Compensating for a lack of dialogue, the actors
are forced to emote with every jaunty gate and jovial face crinkle. The
music by Ludovic Bource follows along with the unfolding plot
punctuating specific moments where it should. The implanted symbolism
and confident camera movements recreate eerily similar tableaux from
classic films like &#x22;Citizen Kane,&#x22; &#x22;Grand Hotel&#x22; and &#x22;The Mark of
Zorro&#x22; with aplomb.<br /><br />It&#x27;s a love letter to film and everyone should be reading it. Or rather
watching each perfectly constructed frame. While some may believe the
silent format is limiting, director Michel Hazanavicius proves it is
anything but. He plays with the medium, toying with the lights,
shadows, sounds and shades like an elaborate puppet show. Watching &#x22;The
Artist&#x22; was almost like unveiling a Jackson Pollock on a cave wall. The
canvas might be obsolete but the painting itself is stunning, striking,
even provocative.<br /><br />And as for pretension? This film is anything but. It&#x27;s candy swathed in
plain wrapping. A sugary sweet concoction well hidden in the upper
cabinet of a gourmet kitchen. 100% pure entertainment for all ages or
at least anyone who dares to laugh in silence and dream in black and
white.
