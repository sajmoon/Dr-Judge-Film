1. Nice try, but this is tedious and boring!<br /><br />2. The movie might interest you if you are octogenarian, or have 0
insight into gender roles?<br /><br />3. The message of the movie is basic Psych. If you don&#x27;t know these
dynamics read on-<br /><br />4. Men have fragile egos. They are intimidated and wounded by change,
and reversal of stereotypical roles. The movie line is simple; man
failed do to changing technology. He lost his manhood(profession). He
is devastated.<br /><br />A nurturing actress, whom would rather be home nurturing and nesting,
falls into the Hollywood fantasy. She eats up the attention, but the
motherly instinct attracts he to the failed Actor.<br /><br />The man regains his ego, and the actress is completely fulfilled(she
has a career and and man). The end!<br /><br />People--if you don&#x27;t already know this; Women want everything(respect
and love, kids, and money, and money). Men want clingy, young,child
bearing,kind,Electra,females. We are still cavemen, and women still
want a nice cave with a big wall where she can create art--not for a
specific drive, but for accolades. Don&#x27;t over-think human interaction.<br /><br />The dog might deserve an academy award?<br /><br />Women have become the men they want to marry. Men just want a good,
moral, attractive Squaw. <br /><br />Excuse the grammar and spelling--I just found out a friend had a heart
attack(probably trying to impress to opposite sex?)
