Is this an invitation to re-score silent movies? If so, then good show!
But it isn&#x27;t, is it? No, in spite of good acting and dancing, this is
fluff and no more than that. From the first frame to the last totally
predictable.<br /><br />I guess the hype derives from the fact that only few people look at
silent movies nowadays. The originals, such as The Crowd, Sunrise and
City Lights and, why not, Safety Last or The Mark of Zorro are all far
better and far less predictable.<br /><br />If this film catches your interest for the old silent films then it has
done more than you could have expected from it, I guess.
