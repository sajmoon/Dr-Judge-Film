2012_February 5 
I won&#x27;t mince words here: for me this was a desperately disappointing
film. I am a passionate fan of the movies, especially the silents, of
which I have seen more than a hundred, ranging from the excellent to
the almost unwatchable and I must say that &#x22;The Artist&#x22; does not come
up to my expectations. I shall be very surprised if it wins any major
awards. It is not a silent film, it is not even a silent film with
recorded musical score and occasional sound effects like, say &#x22;Sunset&#x22;
or &#x22;The Trail of &#x27;98&#x22;, it is more like a talkie with the dialogue track
muted. The musical score is completely wrong as it sounds to me a
couple of decades later than the period of the film. There is too much
lip movement and there are too few titles: silent movie lovers will
know that by the end of the silent era, titles were used sparingly and
the unheard dialogue was short and to the point. Add to this the fact
that the lead characters were not particularly likable and the film was
too long. I was expecting a tribute to the art form I love and ended up
watching a spoof! I much prefer &#x22;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&#x22;-at least it is an
honest spoof.
