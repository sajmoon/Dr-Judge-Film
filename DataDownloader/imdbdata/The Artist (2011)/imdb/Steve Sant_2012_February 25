I read an interesting take on The Artist here:
http://4thdimensionfilms.wordpress.com/<br /><br />When I first saw &#x22;The Artist,&#x22; I couldn&#x27;t quite make out whether this
film was a gimmicky effort made to appeal to a niche segment of
cinephiles or a finely crafted homage to the silent era.<br /><br />Directed by the relatively unknown Michel Hazanavicius, &#x22;Artist&#x22; (2011)
has garnered glowing critical review including three Oscar nominations
for Hazanavicius: best director, best original screenplay and best
editing.<br /><br />Despite that, &#x22;Artist&#x22; is still not in the same league as its cinematic
ancestors: &#x22;The Passion of Joan of Arc&#x22; (Carl Theodor Dreyer, 1928),
&#x22;The Battleship Potemkin&#x22; (Sergei M. Eisenstein, 1925), &#x22;Greed&#x22; (Erich
Von Stroheim, 1924), &#x22;The General&#x22; (Buster Keaton, 1926) and
&#x22;Metropolis&#x22; (Fritz Lang, 1927) are just a handful of films from that
era that should, at the very least, receive a special screening by the
academy prior to handing out any statuette for &#x22;Artist.&#x22;
