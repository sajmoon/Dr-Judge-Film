I went into this film with high expectations and came out disappointed.
I attended an afternoon matin&#xE9;e expecting to have the cinema pretty
much to myself but the place was full. The audience were fairly mature
so I suspect there was a special admission price. On the face of it
they might have been pre-disposed to like a film that referenced older
productions. There was some very low key laughter at the antics of the
dog but otherwise little reaction from the audience which I took to be
a reflection of a general lack of engagement.<br /><br />I didn&#x27;t mind that the story was corny and I really really liked the
music, especially when they let it rip in the dramatic sequences. But I
was very disappointed with the cinematography and that&#x27;s what killed it
for me. The best (original) black and white films, sound or silent,
have a numinous quality about them which draws you in and can make you
gasp at its sheer beauty (for instance Sunset Boulevard, which the
Artist borrows from, Rebecca or Lean&#x27;s Oliver Twist). As someone who
likes to SHOUT rather more than I do has pointed out, the film-makers
seem to have achieved a rather muddy image only getting close to a good
high contrast black and white look in the last few minutes! <br /><br />The Artist is all about the image in more ways than one. The lack of
dialogue didn&#x27;t bother me but I expected the black and white to be
rendered much more artfully. I suspect it&#x27;s also about image in the
praise it has received &#x96; the critics liked it and it and as praise is
heaped upon it, it becomes more difficult to dissent.<br /><br />The Artist isn&#x27;t a bad film. It&#x27;s a great idea, let down by the
photography which just isn&#x27;t good enough. It deserves an audience and
there is a lot of pleasure to be had in watching it but it just isn&#x27;t
anywhere near as good as most of the critics and reviews on IMDb
suggest.
