Like I&#x27;ve seen written in so many reviews already, this movie is a
declaration of love to the movies and, in particular, the silent movie
era. It shows an incredible dedication to this lost art that is still
part of the imaginary of so many film lovers.<br /><br />The actors perfectly mimic the acting of the era, the music is
extraordinary and the storyline is moving and funny enough to keep you
interested and entertained for the whole one and a half hour. It never
makes in feel bored and it can, at times, even make want to cry of joy.<br /><br />I haven&#x27;t seen many silent movies in my life but I am very interested
in that period of time and, after watching this movie, I felt a huge
urge to start watching all those classics from the past and get to know
more about the art of silent movies.<br /><br />It definitely deserves all the credit it&#x27;s been receiving.
