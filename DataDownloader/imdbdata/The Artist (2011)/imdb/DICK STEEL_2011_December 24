Who would have thought that the trio of writer-director Michel
Hazanavicius, his wife actress Berenice Bejo and actor Jean Dujardin,
all probably better known for their comical spoof of the spy genre with
the OSS 117 movies, could have pull out all the stops and made such an
affecting romantic film that epitomizes all things great about an era
of cinema long gone, providing that pitch perfect nostalgic feel and
homage to the black and white greats of the old days where films meant
dressing up, the acting almost always exaggerated, the reading of
inter-titles, with a live orchestra at the front of the hall playing
the soundtrack and providing the emotional cues of the film. The Artist
has been picking up accolades and gaining traction in the cinemas
toward the various award seasons, and it certainly deserves all the
hype and kudos that are coming its way.<br /><br />Hazanavicius&#x27; story deals with the classic tale of rags to riches, and
riches to rags, set against the backdrop of the old Hollywood and star
system, where recognized stars can command just about the world&#x27;s
attention, and a junior artists can aspire to be at the top of the fame
game one day if opportunities, chance and fate all smile their way.
It&#x27;s two stories joint at the hip, one focused on the story of famous
mega film star George Valentin (Dujardin), ubiquitous hero of the
silent film era, now faced with the possibility of extinction given his
studio&#x27;s growing interest toward the talkies, and his adamant belief
that talking pictures is nothing but a passing fad, snug at his
position at the top of his career. But this pride and arrogance bear no
prisoners when audience attitude and technology change, and George soon
fades into oblivion more quickly than his rise and stay to fleeting
fame.<br /><br />The other, parallel story of course deals with actress Peppy Miller
(Bejo), who literally bumps into Valentin during the premiere of his
latest movie, and progressed from obscurity to a big break given by
Valentin himself, who had also offered her a beauty tip that changed
her career fortunes for the better, or rather assisted in her
stratospheric boost in film fortune. She moves from cameos to support
roles and finally marquee large productions, with a flamboyant
personality to boot that helped her heaps, becoming the darling of
Tinseltown and enjoying an equivalent status and perks associated that
George himself had once enjoyed.<br /><br />Not everyone survived the transition from silent films to talkies, and
The Artist doesn&#x27;t sugar coat it all. With the transition, new stars
get born while older ones faded away, especially when their real voices
failed to match up to what audiences had imagined during their heydays,
and rejection at the big screen was easy given a new lineup of stars
all primed to take advantage of the new medium. While watching The
Artist it brought back to mind some memories of the good old days where
I took on a course module just so to watch Pulp Fiction, but got
enthralled by the fascinating silent, black and white classic films
such as King Vidor&#x27;s The Crowd, and The Son of the Sheik starring
Rudolph Valentino, amongst other greats.<br /><br />Technically Hazanavicius&#x27; film can&#x27;t get any better than this, and his
meticulous research during pre-production shows in the delicate touches
put in the film, from costumes and dressing, to set and art direction,
right down to the technical details of framing, camera, and
transitional scene techniques used to tell the silent film story right.
His story here is one that is filled with strong irony throughout,
crafting an incredibly moving and humbling tale of being grateful to
those responsible in any way for one&#x27;s success in any form. For a
modern filmmaker, Hazanavicius did everything right in recreating the
spirit of silent films, complete with powerful, all-encompassing music
by Ludovic Bource to set the tone, emotions and mood right from
beginning until the final scene.<br /><br />Even the acting by the leads were all spot on for the era, who gotten
it all right in both their larger gestures and subtleties. Jean
Dujardin made his George Valentin believable as the famous movie star,
and will have you feel for his character as he bet big on his own
abilities and lost to the winds of change, and had to endure further
whammies to his life in the form of the Great Depression. He possesses
that flair and airs of the star from yesteryear, and is an absolute
delight to watch on screen, more than justifying his Cannes Film
Festival award for Best Actor. Berenice Bejo too owned her role,
sharing fantastic chemistry opposite Dujardin as the woman is forever
indebted to her idol for everything good coming her way, and is trying
her earnest best to reciprocate as best as she can during times of dire
straits. The support cast of James Cromwell, John Goodman and Penelope
Ann Miller were great, but none stood out other than Uggie the Jack
Russell Terrier who single handedly stole the limelight each time it&#x27;s
on screen!<br /><br />Ask anyone these days to watch a black and white, silent film and
you&#x27;ll probably be scoffed at, but to anyone who has not watched The
Artist, it is truly their loss. I only hope that this will spur many of
us who have been bedazzled by large scale special effects in almost
every modern film, to take a look back into the rich and early days of
film to identify the few gems yet to be experienced, and take that bold
step to appreciate them once more. The ending couldn&#x27;t be more perfect
as it heralded yet another era of films, that hammers it all home again
that The Artist had hit all its intended marks set forth, especially
putting that belief in cinema back again. Highly recommended and a
definite entry into any year end lists this year. Do NOT miss this
masterpiece!
