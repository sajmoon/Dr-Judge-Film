I have just seen &#x22;The Artist&#x22;&#x85;what a brilliant film. In fact, one of
the best films I have seen so far. The music complemented the film
perfectly; it put a smile on my face from the very beginning, and
stayed consistently well matched throughout. The acting was perfection.
Using gestures, facial expression, music, symbolism (loved the use of
the staircases, the shadows), and so on, to convey what was happening
was even more potent than speaking the words. The direction was
inspired, flowing beautifully from one scene to another. The cute
little dog was the sparkler on top&#x85;what a fitting and delightful
complement to the film! I cannot fault it at all, and am planning to
see it again. I think perhaps that those who pan this film are more
used to a movie diet of adrenaline pumping action, simple romantic
comedy, or End-Of-The-World-As-We-Know-It disaster films. So of course
they will be let down. My taste is eclectic; I enjoy a wide variety of
genres, and I am definitely no film snob. However, this is a film of
both superb complexity and sublime simplicity. I can recommend it most
heartily.
