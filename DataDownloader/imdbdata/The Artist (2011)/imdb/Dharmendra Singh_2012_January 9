What&#x27;s amazing to me &#x96; something I would never have guessed &#x96; is how
positive the reception is for &#x27;The Artist&#x27;. It isn&#x27;t just a black and
white film. It&#x27;s also a silent film. Those are two of its achievements.
A third one is there&#x27;s nothing to tell this apart from any of the films
from the dawn of the last Century. It is a perfect simulacrum of the
films it aspires to imitate. <br /><br />Truth to tell I wasn&#x27;t blown away, just as I wasn&#x27;t blown away by the
other films I&#x27;ve seen from the 1920s (&#x27;Metropolis&#x27;, &#x27;Battleship
Potemkin&#x27;, &#x27;Nosferatu&#x27;) &#x96; the age into which &#x27;The Artist&#x27; could easily
camouflage itself. But I did enjoy myself and I did feel for the
central character. <br /><br />The story is this. George Valentin (no doubt a play on Rudolph
Valentino, the real-life silent film star), played by Jean Dujardin, is
Hollywood&#x27;s ace actor. Audiences love him, though not quite as much as
he loves himself. While promoting a film, Valentin falls for a fan,
(B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo). He embraces her and they pose for photographs. She
isn&#x27;t camera shy; rather she loves the attention. She auditions for a
bit-part, wins it, and becomes a sensation &#x96; not an overnight one, but
gradually her name &#x96; Peppy Miller &#x96; appears higher up credit lists. <br /><br />Valentin is shown what his studio believes is a breakthrough:
&#x27;talkies&#x27;. He laughs wryly when he hears the sound of words in film for
the first time. He genuinely regards it as a gimmick. People come to
the movies for him &#x96; nothing else, he says. Little does he realise that
the first sound &#x27;talkies&#x27; will make will be to signal the end of
silence. <br /><br />The manipulation of sound is the single most impressive aspect of &#x27;The
Artist&#x27;. After witnessing his first &#x27;talkie&#x27;, Valentin has a
revelation. Suddenly he hears the world &#x96; and it&#x27;s loud. He has lived
in a world where sound was redundant. Director Michel Hazanavicius
makes this point by not allowing Valentin to have a voice. He can speak
and others can hear him, but we can&#x27;t. <br /><br />Hazanavicius is clever in another way. He uses visual metaphors to
convey the points in the story. The one I loved was the one where, when
Miller has confirmed herself as star and Valentin a fading one, they
meet on a stairwell in their studio. The camera pans back to a long
shot, allowing the whole stairwell to fill the screen, making it look
like a sort of dollhouse. Miller ascends the stairs, Valentin descends
them; one goes up, one goes down; one rises, one falls. <br /><br />I noticed that title cards are not used for every bit of silent
dialogue: a brilliant decision. I&#x27;m often put off by text because a
film is something to be watched, not read. Where title cards are not
used, meaning can be intuited by reading characters&#x27; body language &#x96;
just as audiences had to in the 1920s. <br /><br />Further in the story, Valentin&#x27;s continued refusal to acknowledge sound
causes him to fall out with the suits (led by John Goodman, who is very
good as a mute considering he is famous for his voice), highlighting
the message that stars have and will always be the studios&#x27; playthings.
Valentin decides to use what pull he has left to become a director and
a producer. <br /><br />But he does so in vain. Talkies didn&#x27;t only signal the end of silent
films; they also heralded the demise of the old stars associated with
them. New blood, crucially new young blood, would introduce the sound
revolution. Valentin loses everything: his wife (a lovelorn Penelope
Ann Miller), his fame, his bankability. As if that wasn&#x27;t enough, the
stock market crash swipes his wealth, too. All Valentin can do is drink
and rue his situation. He becomes a living relic, teetering on the edge
of extinction. <br /><br />I loved that Miller provides succour, not because she owes her career
to Valentin, but because she sees a helpless soul who needs the touch
of angel to be reborn. Miller offers a solution, which is delightfully
ironic: the musical. Valentin regains all that he lost, but now stars
in a genre which was itself a new movement in motion pictures. And so
we have a wonderful riches to rags &#x96; and back to riches again &#x96; story. <br /><br />I saw the film with what I perceived to be an audience with an average
age of fifty. I mention that for a reason. The critics are going nuts
for this because most of them will be old enough to remember watching
nothing but B&#x26;W as children. Roger Ebert, the best-known &#x96; and I think
best &#x96; film critic wrote lovingly and with erudition about B&#x26;W. <br /><br />I&#x27;m of the view, however, that the question of a film&#x27;s value isn&#x27;t one
concerning the head, but the heart. So I think Ebert&#x27;s
intellectualisation of the merits of B&#x26;W versus colour, although
compelling, is redundant. It&#x27;s a childhood thing. What your eyes laid
upon for the very first time, what one grows up with, is the thing one
will learn to love. <br /><br />&#x27;The Artist&#x27; isn&#x27;t the start (or re-start) of a silent or B&#x26;W
renaissance. We&#x27;ve moved on from those styles. &#x27;The people are never
wrong&#x27; says John Goodman&#x27;s character. &#x27;Raging Bull&#x27; didn&#x27;t inspire a
B&#x26;W revolution, neither did &#x27;Schindler&#x27;s List&#x27;. &#x27;The Artist&#x27; is like
its lead character: nostalgic for a bygone age.
