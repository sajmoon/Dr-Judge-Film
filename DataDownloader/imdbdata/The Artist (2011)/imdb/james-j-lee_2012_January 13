It may have been a cold January night in Leicester Square when I left
the cinema but inside I was glowing, my faith somewhat restored in film
having just seen this heartwarming classic.<br /><br />There&#x27;s little point going through the deeply romantic/dramatic plot
set in stark contrast against the shallow world of 1920&#x27;s Hollywood as
it may only spoil it for those yet to see, but in summary this film is
a real gem, a true joy to behold with a clever little unpredictable
twist at the end. Fabulous acting, superb score, great cinematography
and look out for a star turn from a little performing dog which is
quite amazing at times.<br /><br />With lots of classic touches woven throughout this movie, expect to
laugh out loud, cry real tears and go through a roller-coaster of
emotions as you will no doubt watch in fascination, the vivid
recreation of an exceptional time in the history of cinema (the advent
of talkies)and the history of the America (Wall St Crash/Great
Depression).<br /><br />Though it is a silent film, sound is used in a very clever way.
Similarly the director meshes subtle modern cinema techniques with some
classic framing and detail. This is a glorious mixture of the old and
the new and has great balance between light comedy/entertainment,
intense romance and at times dark drama. The result being interesting
characters that engage on many levels.<br /><br />It&#x27;s worth mentioning the nods to some of cinema&#x27;s all time classic
films like Singing in the Rain, Sunset Boulevard and Citizen Kane(and
several Chaplin classics) but it&#x27;s not plagiarism, parody or
irreverence - it&#x27;s a beautiful pastiche of the cinema&#x27;s finest.
Watching The Artist, feels like someone was clearing out an old
Hollywood Studio and stumbled upon one of the greatest silents (if not
films) of them all and suddenly the lost masterpiece is revealed to the
world.<br /><br />Emerging from the Cinema and into the crisp night air of Leicester
Square, my thoughts were on one thing...how many Oscars will this
instant classic win come February? The Academy certainly didn&#x27;t
disappoint as it picked up 5 Oscars including Best Actor, Best Picture
and Best Director. <br /><br />A big thank you to all who were involved in this magnificent
production, a truly wonderful film, delivering a great cinematic
experience.
