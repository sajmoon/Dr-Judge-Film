&#x22;The Artist&#x22; is a true cinematic achievement. In this day and age of
CGI effects, color, 3-D and wide screen, here is a film done for all
practical purposes, like a film made in 1928. This is so well-made it
hard to know where to begin. The music score has the sound of an actual
Vitaphone score from the period. In particular, some of the score
reminded me of &#x22;The Jazz Singer&#x22;. The narrow-screen aspect and
evocative black-and-white photography added to the vintage atmosphere
the makers were trying to convey. The players are all excellent, and
wow! Can the two leads dance? Watch them! It took me about a month to
see this because it did not play at all in Chicago for the first month
of it&#x27;s limited release. At the end of the screening, the audience
actually applauded. Something I haven&#x27;t seen in a long time. The
appreciation by the audience made me think that if a contemporary
audience can enjoy this, they may not avoid some of the other classic
silent films that are still available to be enjoyed. So &#x22;The Artist&#x22;,
great film that it is on it&#x27;s own could serve as a trailer for those
uninitiated to the joys of the silent classics.
