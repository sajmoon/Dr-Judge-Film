Hello, Silent films are obviously by far a thing of the past and with
the dawn of new 21st century technologies, like 3-d and imax, you would
think the format would never creep back onto the silver screen again.
Until now. The artist has shovelled past the half hearted 3-d action
and animation flicks that have flooded the autumn/winter box office and
is now the &#x27;talk of the town&#x27;. &#x27;For how could a black and white silent
film be any better than a film in colour and shot in SPECTACULAR
3-D!!!&#x27; Easily! And here&#x27;s why... Film making today isn&#x27;t what is used
to be, today, production teams are littered with high tech equipment
(like 3-D camera&#x27;s!) That for some reason, (needed or not) they think
is a necessity in the film. But what&#x27;s to say we can&#x27;t go back to old
roots like the artist has done? Simply because companies don&#x27;t want to
lose money, that&#x27;s why the artist is such a big risk. But the risk has
defiantly paid off as new films made with new technology are being
overlooked as this new film with old technology is stealing the
limelight and its such a nice sight to see. As of course the artist is
one of the best films I&#x27;ve seen for a while. Its such a breath of fresh
air to see such a film which along with a heart warming story line
delivers great acting performances around the board especially from
Jean Dujardin (and of course Uggie the dog!) But the aspect I really
loved about this film was the screen play and the overall style in
which this film was shot. I especially loved the opening sequence in
which ( however corny it may sound) I really felt as if I was actually
in a theatre of the time with the band playing live in front of me. By
seeing this scene at the start where &#x27;George Valentin&#x27; is happy and
charismatic, it means that we can really relate to the character
throughout the film going with him though his highs and lows . Overall
I think this film was beautiful, a real unlikely masterpiece for a film
of the 21st century. One that will always stand the test of time and
one that should defiantly win the awards for best film and of course to
Michel Hazanavicius for best director. They most certainly do not make
them like they used to!<br /><br />****<br /><br />Calum.R
