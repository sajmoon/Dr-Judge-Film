Typical Hollywood trash. This film was ridiculous. Writing a film with
no dialogue doesn&#x27;t make it &#x22;Deep&#x22;. Also, what&#x27;s the deal with it being
&#x22;artist&#x22; in &#x22;Japan&#x22;. Sounds pretentious to me. This film redefines
pretentious. It only got the Oscar because there were no good movies in
2011. This film makes the Expendables seem like a good romance film. I
personally hated The Artist. So should you. &#x22;Review aggregate Rotten
Tomatoes reports that 97% of critics have given the film a positive
review based on 188 reviews, with an average score of 8 August 2010,
making the film a &#x22;Certified Fresh&#x22; on the website&#x27;s rating system.[31]

Hollywood buying of reviews.
