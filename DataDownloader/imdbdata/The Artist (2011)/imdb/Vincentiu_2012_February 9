2012_February 9 
a nice, touching experience. piece of an old vase. photo album from
library. fire in winter evening. moralistic lesson. beautiful in magic
way. sensitive, nice, soft, silky. homage to lost age of a gorgeous art
with its instruments. a show. behind definitions. but has it roots ? it
is more than a short delight? I do not know. it is French. in same
measure it is American. it gives drops from magic and large slices of
Chaplin stories. it speaks about a form of Rudolph Valentino and
present a realistic idyllic tale. it gives perfect characters and
shadow of a spirit. it is a puzzle and a testimony. a charming actor, a
beautiful young woman and a dog. all in black and white , without the
protection of words. letter of love and manifesto. another Scorsese
Hugo with different taste but same essence.and just taste is key. the
courage to create an experiment, window of dusty house, basic tale
about small things who gives sense for every existence. a film about
cinema as way to discover world. a refuge. and seed of happiness. or
only yellow page from a diary. like every wizard of Oz.
