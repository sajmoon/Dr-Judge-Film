Well silent films they said, it was a thing of the past.. but this film
truly proved otherwise... the film which is actually a romantic comedy
drama was packed with powerful performances from Jean Dujardin and
Berenice Bejo who played the characters George valentin and Peppy
Miller. Well one cannot forget the adorable dog Uggie as well...<br /><br />The film revolves around George Valentin and Peppy miller. Peppy
accidentally bumps into him while he was posing for pictures after
release of his film outside the theatre.. George reacts kindly and
poses with her for the camera... She is then the talk of the town
everyone wanting to know the mystery girl...Peppy full of fun as she
is, manages to get a role for a dance scene in George&#x27;s movie.. but
when the director comes to know that this was the same girl whose pics
were all over the papers with George, reacts rather angrily and asks
her to leave immediately.. However George once again comes to the
rescue and keeps her back for the shoot.. <br /><br />Peppy slowly gains fame in the industry and is loved by everyone for
her her bubbly and sweet personality.. <br /><br />Things take an ugly turn suddenly when The studio announces the end of
silent films which does not go very well with George.. He decides to
produce and direct his own silent film.. the film is completed with
george financing the entire movie himself and the release date is
fixed.. Coincidentally Peppy&#x27;s sound film also is set for release the
same day...things go even worse for George when the stock market
crashes and George is headed for Bankruptcy..Now only the film can save
him from his financial crisis. But the audience is not interested in
silent films anymore and with the new flame Peppy all rush to watch the
premier of her film.<br /><br />But Peppy who had always a liking for George and grateful for him
attends his premier and is saddened on seeing the very low turnout for
the premier..<br /><br />Dejected George heads home from the theatre only to find a note from
his wife.. she had left him and informed him to clear his belongings
from the house...<br /><br />George moves into an apartment with his valet.. Out of money, George
has all his personal belongings auctioned off.. . He bumps into Peppy
at a restaurant one day who was being interviewed. She mentions that
people are looking for a change now and that silent films was a thing
of the past.. On hearing this George who was seated next to her does
not take it well and leaves after congratulating her.<br /><br />George then forces his valet clifton to leave and find another job as
george had not paid him for a year. <br /><br />Dejected and drunk he burns all his collections of films but holds onto
one of the films...the fire spreads and he is trapped inside.. his dog
uggie runs out and manages to get help from a policeman nearby. <br /><br />Peppy on hearing the news of the accident rushes to the hospital to see
him .. she notices the film which george had held on to tight during
the accident.. it was the take&#x27;s of the scenes he had with her in the
movie..She then takes him to her house and looks after him...George
wakes up and is happy to see Peppy and also finds his valet who now
works with Peppy.. She then proceeds to the studio for her shoot.. over
there she manages to convince her director to cast George in her
movie.. Meanwhile George enters one of her rooms in the house and finds
all his personal belongings that were auctioned off.. he is upset and
leaves her house to his apartment... Peppy panics when she finds out
about this when she reaches home and she rushes to his apartment..
George attempts to commit suicide by shooting himself but stops when he
see&#x27;s Peppy. They then embrace and Peppy mentions that they could try
one thing together.. <br /><br />Both manage to put up a musical dance act together to persuade the
director to put a film for them together.. The film ends with the sound
finally coming in...<br /><br />Credit to Jean Dujardin for his excellent silent performance.. Berenice
also put up a splendid performance and was quite bubbly and peppy in
her way...<br /><br />Overall the movie was not a classic but definitely a worth watch movie
for this year... A definite score of 8 from me!!!!
