This must be a case of &#x22;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&#x22;. Someone thought
this was great movie making, so everyone falls in line? This was
nothing more than novelty. First, the story&#x85; cute but nothing that
would &#x22;WOW&#x22; me. &#x22;Avatar&#x22; was blasted for stealing its story from
previous screenplays, but not this movie. I saw &#x22;Singin&#x27; In The Rain&#x22;
(which was much more entertaining) and &#x22;A Star Is Born&#x22; blatantly in
this story. Nothing original here. The acting was adequate but Academy
Award worthy? My favorite performance was Uggie. Finally, big
disappointment in basic movie technology. Video standard screen size? I
go to the movie theater to see widescreen. Audio only coming from the
front; what happened to surround sound? (If you state that the intent
of the movie was to see it as a silent movie then why was it filmed
digitally.) I should have waited for the DVD. I guess with all the hype
my expectations were much too high, but I have seen far superior silent
movies on TCM. If I as missing something, please&#x85; enlighten me!
