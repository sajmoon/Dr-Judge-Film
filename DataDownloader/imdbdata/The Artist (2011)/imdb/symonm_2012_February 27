It&#x27;s easy to be disappointed when you so want to like something and I
so wanted to like this, because I loved the idea of something so
different, so out of the norm, yet made in the modern era. It not only
didn&#x27;t disappoint, it far exceeded my hopes and I and everyone with me
left the cinema with huge smiles on our faces.<br /><br />What a wonderful simple tale, beautifully told and acted by both
newcomer leads. Moving, funny, enthralling and so genuinely uplifting
that I cannot imagine what sort of person wouldn&#x27;t love this film.<br /><br />The fact that many won&#x27;t bother to see it because it&#x27;s B&#x26;W or silent or
retro or whatever prejudicial reason some people have in their heads is
impossible to comment upon without a certain amount of pity for those
that think that way.<br /><br />Is it the best movie of the year? Maybe, maybe not but it deserves it&#x27;s
awards and every piece of positive praise it gets. Don&#x27;t even get me
started on the dog (and I&#x27;m not a &#x22;pet person&#x22; in the slightest) but he
deserves an Oscar too.<br /><br />Fabulous all round old fashioned feel good movie. I loved it-You will
too.
