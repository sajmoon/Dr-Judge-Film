The Artist actually does all the things that it shouldn&#x27;t be doing if
it wants to appeal to the generic herd of moviegoers - monochrome,
silent and not consisting of any cinematic behemoth to carry the mantle
of wooing the audiences. It is undeniable that the allure of a
black-and- white film of the silent era remains highly esoteric. &#x27;It
died for a reason,&#x27; one might say. &#x27;Sound killed it.&#x27; Agreed. But the
fact that The Artist does better than almost all the other movies of
the year comes across as a rather delightful irony.<br /><br />The transition of movies from silence to sound has been remarkably
captured through the various perspectives of a plethora of those
affected by Singin&#x27; in the Rain and Sunset Boulevard, to name two. The
Artist seems inspired from the former, with its quirky sense of humour
and all, while has a protagonist who shares the dogma of Norma Desmond
as far as &#x27;talkie&#x27; movies are concerned. The man is George Valentin
(Jean Dujardin), a conceited, debobair, illustrious actor of an era
where facial contortions and subtitles did most of the talking. While
celebrating the success of his latest movie, he bumps into Peppy Miller
(Berenice Bejo), who later turns into the luckiest of his throngs of
worshippers. There is the spark of romance there, but that flame is
left unkindled, since Valentin is married to Doris (Penelope Ann
Miller) despite rather unhappily. But his tidal wave of confidence soon
tosses him ashore with the introduction of sound in cinema, with Peppy
being one of the harbingers of the winds of change. With the writing on
the wall being all too clear, it is Valentin&#x27;s amore-propre that blinds
him, as the zeitgeist sweeps through like a storm, leaving him stripped
of everything but his vanity, as the artist now has to learn the
artform of survival.<br /><br />The movie is like a monologue of how change is inevitable and how we
must adapt or get run-over by it. It preaches this lesson by drawing
parallels between the old and new. The initial comparison is between
wordless movies and cinema after the inception of sound and how the
unfortunate former perished at the hands of sound. However, this
comparison is also personified, as it betrays the appearance of a
metaphor between the characters of George and Peppy - the former an
imploding star, the latter a new sunrise. &#x27;Out with the old, in with
the new. Make way for the young!&#x27; Peppy says, as George overhears her.
Just like soundless movies were annihilated out of existence
unceremoniously, George realizes that it might be his turn to suffer
the same fate if he doesn&#x27;t embrace the change.<br /><br />The performances are fabulous, with a special mention going out the
dog, who deserves the honour of being the best canine I have ever seen.
Dujardin with his pencil moustache gives his act a certain
authenticity, while the gregarious, affectionate Peppy is right in her
shoes. The differences brought about in the acting, as compared to
regular movies due to the absence of a voice are palpable - subtlelties
are paid special attention to, physical movements flow like a cadence
and the eyes convey most of the emotions. Though the acting might seem
overdone, with all the accentuation and exaggerated movements, one must
remember that it does justice to its requirements and to history, and
is hence befits the film.<br /><br />But the movie has its shortcomings, some of which are too blatant to
ignore. Primary of these is the rather hackneyed storyline. If you want
a movie that talks about what a silent-movie-icon goes through once
sound is introduced, you need to look no further than Billy Wilder&#x27;s
Sunset Boulevard. The only thing that movie did different from The
Artist is track the downfall of its protagonist into insanity, while
The Artist doesn&#x27;t go that far. The parallel subplot about a youngling
shooting to stardom as another falls has also been done before, though
not to death (A Star is Born, for instance). So, that&#x27;s hardly a
surprise too.<br /><br />Since the film begins as a comedy, and masquerades like one for a
sizeable proportion of its run-time (heck, it won the Golden Globe for
Best Picture Comedy), once it gradually descends into a tragedy, The
Artist fails to get its viewers along, who happen to get stuck in a
limbo between laughter and sympathy at the protagonist&#x27;s fate. The
seriousness that one needs to empathize with Valentin is amiss because
the movie begins on too much of an upbeat note. This failure, arising
from trying to balance on two rafts at the same time, unfortunately,
makes it a case of being lost in transition. <br /><br />The Artist isn&#x27;t merely a movie with a message, it is also an ode to
movies of the day when Hollywood was popular as Hollywoodland. The
movie exudes an air of the late 1920s and early 1930s - every third man
wearing bowler hats, the paparazzi hobbling around with archaic
cameras, movies that ended as soon as the director got bored of
shooting. The film has a panache, a vivacity, that one rarely gets to
see in modern times. However, the salute is accomplished when the film
makes its final move - outdoing most other films of the year in terms
of excellence, which shows that Valetin, actually, might have been
right.
