Even the most lavish aristocratic banquet or the excessive intake of
special drinks of variable alcohol content in any decadent soir&#xE9;e would
not have caused this Herr Graf to imagine that, during the first decade
of the XXI century, silent films would come back in fashion after
having vanished almost 100 years before.<br /><br />&#x22;The Artist&#x22; (2011) is the picture in question and Herr Michel
Hazanavicius the director; a silent film that has won considerable
success with the public and the critics all around the world. Amazing
that in these modernen times with its endless procession of noisy
gadgetry that such a film has achieved vast approval. And if we add
that &#x22;The Artist&#x22; is a French production concerned with how the coming
of sound affected many actors, namely &#x22;American&#x22; actors, then this Her
Graf doesn&#x27;t understand a word, although probably the reason of this
was that the film in question has French intertitles&#x85;<br /><br />However, while this Herr Graf was watching &#x22;The Artist&#x22; at the Schloss
theatre, he felt something very strange in his stiff heart, a turmoil
of different and contradictory feelings that gave him a particular
sensation or as French commoners said, a &#x22;d&#xE9;j&#xE0; vu&#x22;.<br /><br />This German count does not, in any way, want to lecture or to rant
about the tricky aspects of a film such as &#x22;The Artist&#x22; or what is
supposed to be the quintessence of a silent film, and how this
particular vision is almost a parody of its subject and uses many
stereotypes about the era. Rather, since the film is celebrating silent
movies, this Herr von can only applaud Herr Hazanavicius. He
accomplished a formidable task given that most people today have never
even seen a silent film or even one in black and white. He had to
approximate a silent film in a rather clich&#xE9;&#x27; way in terms of story and
the style is more like a talkie than a silent but this had to be done
to overcome the prejudices of modernen audiences.<br /><br />So, consequently the fact that a &#x22;new&#x22; silent film like the &#x22;The
Artist&#x22; has been given the support and approval of the public is fit
sociological subject. Will this lead to the new longhaired generations
appreciating silent film? If that does happen it will be the most
incredible and shocking news to this Herr Graf since his fat and rich
Teutonic heiresses decided to get rid of their corsets.<br /><br />And now, if you&#x27;ll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because
this German Count must put on again his old but now fashionable tuxedo.
