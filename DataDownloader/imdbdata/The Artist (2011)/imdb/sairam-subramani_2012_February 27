This is the first silent film I&#x27;ve ever watched. The last of the non-
talkies were in existence way back in the 1930s and for &#x22;The Artist&#x22; to
revitalize this so-called &#x27;dead&#x27; genre is simply a marvellous
achievement. I wouldn&#x27;t be overstating it when I say it is possibly the
best work in film-making in the 21st century.<br /><br />For starters, the brisk pace and sheer entertainment factor of this
movie catches you off guard as it is something not usually expected of
a silent film. The acting by both Jean Dujardin (what a well-deserved
Oscar win his was) and Berenice Bejo (would have loved to see her win
too; on reflection though, the competition this year made that
virtually impossible in either category) is tremendous. The complex
task of expressing emotions without the aid of verbal activity is a
feat accomplished with nonchalant ease by the duo. The original score
(don&#x27;t bother with the baseless controversies regarding an alleged
rip-off from the score of &#x22;Vertigo&#x22;) by Ludovic Bource is as good as it
gets, and landed him and the film another well-deserved Oscar nod. And
finally, the screen writing and direction by Michel Hazanavicius is
first-class; overall a stupendous work of art befitting the title of
the film.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t be put off by the superficial &#x27;lack of punch&#x27; generally
associated with silent films. Watch this and your respect for the
classic silver screen cinema might just increase manifold.
