Having berated our local multiplex for initially refusing to screen
this film, I was pleased to have the chance to view it, and was looking
forward to a good night out. Of course, it&#x27;s difficult to ignore the
hype, but to take it on trust is a mistake. It just goes to show that
you should read more about a movie before you go and see it. I was
expecting some uproarious comedy, not some derivative homage to
&#x27;Ollywood. It was mildly amusing, with a winning performance by the
dog, but the &#x27;plot&#x27; was slight and I&#x27;m not sure I got it. The lack of
dialogue deprived the characters of any depth or sympathy.<br /><br />&#x22;The Woman In Black&#x22; was more enjoyable, &#x22;The Descendants&#x22; more worthy
of recognition.<br /><br />There is a reason why no-one makes silent movies anymore, and why they
are never screened on TV anymore. Talkies are superior. Alas, the
Academy is filled with people who are unwilling to stand out from the
crowd and point out that this Emperor may have been clothed, but
ordinarily so.
