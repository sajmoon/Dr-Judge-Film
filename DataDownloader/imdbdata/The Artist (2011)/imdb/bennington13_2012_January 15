The Artist has swept into UK cinemas on a tidal wave of critical
acclaim, and a raft of increasingly major awards. Set in the late
1920s, just as the advent of sound overturns the Hollywood status quo,
The Artist tracks the pride and fall of George Valentin (Jean DuJardin,
best known over here for the OSS 117 espionage parodies) following a
chance encounter with Peppy Miller (personified by the delightful
B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo).<br /><br />It&#x27;s a credit to those involved, particularly writer-director Michel
Hazanavicius, that what is in effect one of the oldest tales in
Hollywood, spun in everything from Singing in the Rain to Sunset
Boulevard, is a beautifully crafted homage rather than the empty,
prattling clich&#xE9; it could so easily have become. DuJardin is terrific
as the charming but conceited Valentin, with all the old school grace
and swagger of Old Hollywoodland heartthrobs, from Douglas Fairbanks to
Rudolph Valentino. By the same token, his co-star Bejo, though slightly
sidelined at times, is captivating as the aptly named Peppy, big-eyed
and beguiling from start to finish. <br /><br />Yet it&#x27;s worth pausing to consider that The Artist is not, strictly
speaking, a silent movie - it&#x27;s actually a movie that happens to be
silent, an admittedly specious, but nonetheless important distinction.
It&#x27;s a modern movie shot in black and white with only a single line of
dialogue and virtually no sound apart from the musical soundtrack. But
silent movies were a distinct genre. The absence of sound and dialogue
necessitated a different approach to storytelling, with an emphasis on
movement and action, not to mention brevity - the average length of a
silent movie in 1910 was about 30 minutes. <br /><br />By contrast, The Artist is 100 minutes long, positively curt by modern
standards. But without the crutch of dialogue to lean on, 100 minutes
is perhaps too long in this case. Instead, the audience is virtually
required to spend portions of The Artist lip reading during scenes
which, had they been cut, would undoubtedly have strengthened as well
has shortened the film. Because The Artist works best during the
(majority of) scenes that require little or no speaking. Shots of
audiences applauding, of Valentin wandering the streets alone, the
discovery of an anonymous but humiliating act of charity - all of these
moments are as gripping, perhaps more so for not being accompanied by
hackneyed dialogue. Bejo and DuJardin excel at pratfalling, their
shameless mugging and jazz age japes only serving to highlight the
pathos they evoke elsewhere, all the more startling for being totally
reliant on their physical performance alone. <br /><br />What I&#x27;m trying to say I suppose is that The Artist is a wonderful
movie, but one that perhaps panders to critics and fans of early
Hollywood movies a little more than the average modern cinema goer -
the final line (spoken out loud), may feel a little anti climactic for
some, but it&#x27;s rich with meaning and Tinseltown history. It&#x27;s a film
that wants to be clever (the much mooted dream sequence) as well as
heartwarming (any scene involving James Cromwell&#x27;s Driver or Valentin&#x27;s
adorably faithful mutt), but occasionally finds it difficult to
reconcile the two (the final set of intertitles are the punchline to a
joke that feels a little jarring). And yet by the time the final foot
has tapped, all such minor (and in the grand scheme of things, they are
minor) flaws will be forgiven.<br /><br />Go because the media has stoked your curiosity, but stay because of the
unabashed feelgood factor. If you can escape the relentless buzz around
The Artist, it is a gem of a movie that will help you relocate the
cockles of your heart.
