2012_January 16 
One of the most boring and torturing movies of the decade. If you want
to waste your money and time, go watch it. The movie hardly connects
with the viewers.<br /><br />There is hardly any chemistry between Jean Dujardin and Penelope Ann
Miller or anyone else. In fact Dujardin looked like a kid in presence
of Penelope.<br /><br />The whole movie could be predicted from very beginning. And there was
nothing fresh or new in this movie. The humor was far from comic.<br /><br />And you would feel like crying. Only thing good in the movie was the
costumes of Dujardin and the shooting location i.e France. Other than
these there was nothing in this movie worth watching.
