Okay, this is the first and only silent film I have seen in cinemas.
For a fact I didn&#x27;t go in with any expectations at all. The only
negative that I have to say about this is how it consistently variates
between silents and talkies twice - once being a nightmare about how
talkies will revolutionize cinema and the lead character wants to stay
in silent cinema and therefore can&#x27;t speak in a world with talkie
sound. The other is at the end.<br /><br />The plot is simply a silent star who is on top of the world (who&#x27;s kind
of a show-off if you ask me), meanwhile there is this girl who wants to
be a movie star, they meet and the star helps this girl. Then there is
the dawn of the next big thing in cinema, talkies. As talkies become
popular so does the girl, as that happens the silent star then can&#x27;t
find work. Soon the name &#x22;Peppy Miller&#x22; (the girl) is a well-known
household-type name, George Valentin (the silent star) is just an
alcohol addict, a nobody. Valentin does any means necessary to finance
another silent film.<br /><br />Valentin finances another film and the night before it is released
Peppy says that talkies are good silents are bad, Valentin is obviously
upset at this and says something to let her know what she&#x27;s said. The
next day the film he&#x27;s financed turns out to be a box office bomb (with
one of the people seeing it being Peppy Miller) then when he walks
outside he finds her new film with people lining up to get into the
cinemas.<br /><br />This is about all the plot I will reveal to you (a few of the times
when I reveal the ending is if I think the movie is bad which I think
is quite good or I feel is worth mentioning). All I will say is that it
will be an eye opener for what some of the silent stars went through
when talkies came about. The end result of this is a decent movie, not
for an average viewer of movies yet this does have some
characterization (the best person they characterized being Valentin,
some of the others I didn&#x27;t feel for) in my opinion this is not the
best of 2011, but it is an opinion and only an opinion, as far as
movies nominated (or won) Oscars go I know this is one of the better
movies they nominate.
