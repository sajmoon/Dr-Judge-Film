I just saw this film and will probably see it again. I&#x27;m sure that one
can&#x27;t absorb all the magic the first time. This movie is about a silent
film star who cannot adjust to &#x22;talkies.&#x22; He meets a young dancer, Pepe
Miller, who is set to go places in in the movie industry.<br /><br />The film is largely silent with a wonderful musical score which soars.
The black and white background lend itself the the nostalgic feeling
and evokes the right emotion.<br /><br />I must mention the little dog which stole the show. He is Valentin&#x27;s
faithful companion throughout all his trials. The dog is so good, he
almost deserves his own award.<br /><br />Highly recommended for the discerning moviegoer.
