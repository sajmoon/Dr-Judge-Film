So this is a silent movie about the end of silent movies... Some people
may think this is a symbolic parallel or credit it to artistic
creativity but I found the concept lacking. The only thing I thought
walking out of this movie was, &#x22;man, I&#x27;m sure glad we don&#x27;t have silent
movies anymore.&#x22; Personally, I found it boring (and judging by the
audible snoring I heard within the theater, I wasn&#x27;t the only one),
thought it was slow to develop and generally lacked any type of plot.
However, by looking at the other ratings, my opinion is clearly in the
minority.<br /><br />To each his own.
