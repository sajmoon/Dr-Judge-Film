The Artist (Dir. Michel Hazanavicius, 2011) focuses on the career of a
silent film star and his transition into the classical Hollywood era
where &#x22;talkies&#x22; dominate. His career is contended by the incredible
performances of a new star, Peppy Miller (B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo). The film
progresses, following her rise and his demise.<br /><br />The Artist is colourless and silent which can be off-putting for the
generic film going audience who would prefer to watch another
Transformer film. The story is an interesting one and pays great homage
to the films of the silent era. Through the lack of sound I became more
engaged with the plot and characters of The Artist as there were no
conversations or sound effects to distract ones eye or ear from the
films narrative. When watching it, comparisons between The Artist and
Singin&#x27; in the Rain (Dir. Stanley Donen &#x26; Gene Kelly, 1952) cannot be
overlooked. They both contain very similar narratives, where one actor
is forced out by &#x22;talkies&#x22; while another succeeds.<br /><br />Unlike silent movies from the early 20th century, this film does
incorporate scenes of sound within in the film. Counting it up after
watching the film I believe there are in-fact only two scenes in the
whole hour and a half that use diegetic sound. One scene occurs early
in the film where George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), the film&#x27;s
protagonist, suffers a nightmare on how he won&#x27;t cope with the
transition to sound. This scene is superbly produced. All the objects
Valentin contacts with, in the dream, make sounds as he interacts with
them, but he himself cannot speak. This scene is hauntingly spectacular
as the footage that precedes and follows this scene is silent and
accompanied but a music hall soundtrack. This nightmare scene, however,
has no soundtrack and only the diegetic sound of the objects Valentin
touches.<br /><br />The camera work and editing techniques are similar to that of film-
making in the 1920s. Modern techniques are, however, used within The
Artist as well. At multiple points newspaper headlines are layered onto
the film so as to provide more of a narrative. These techniques were
used in early cinema, but not to the extent or effect that they are in
The Artist. As I mentioned before, this film pays a great homage to the
classics created by the first film-makers.<br /><br />Another noteworthy aspect of this film is the acting. For a French film
there is a large number of popular American faces. This will be due to
the film being set in the United States. Actors John Goodman and James
Cromwell play producer Al Zimmer and Valentin&#x27;s butler. These actors
are fantastic, along with the previous mentioned Dujardin and Bejo, and
create an unforgettable film. Another actor that needs recognition is
Valentin&#x27;s dog. It is one of the most important characters in the film
and also provides great comic relief; the inter-titles near the end of
the film states that Valentin &#x22;owes his life to that dog&#x22;, referring to
a house fire. But subtly I think the inter-titles are implying that the
dog helped make Valentin&#x27;s career.<br /><br />The idea of silent films is often off-putting for a generic film
audience, as mentioned. But this film should seriously be considered
for anyone who enjoys a good film. I also heavily recommend viewing it
at the pictures as cinema is the medium films like this are intended
for. <br /><br />If you enjoyed this review then check out my other reviews on:
