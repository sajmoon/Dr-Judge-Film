2012_February 7 
Boring,boring, boring, no story line worth following, black and
white..are you kidding?? silent!!!! why???? There was a reason the film
industry moved into colour and sound...the same reasons why we no
longer give an anaesthetic with ether..though if someone had offered me
ether I would have found that more enjoyable than sitting through this
long winded, going nowhere, predictable, why bother, isn&#x27;t it over yet,
piece of trash. Had I not been with a friend who had suggested seeing
this, I would have left in minute 4. Did I say I was bored..I was
seething..what a waste of my time and money..HATED EVERY MOMENT!! Left
the cinema with post traumatic stress disorder.The only single
redeeming feature in this movie was the dog. If I could have rated this
movie with a negative score, I would have.
