We have seen this story lots of time: A Star is Born. So the director
decided to do it as a silent movie. The performances are very good and
Dujardin is amazing. The actors are so good that there is almost no
need for dialogue and you know both in terms of plot and emotion what
is going on without explanation. As a technical feat, this silent film
is 10 stars, but you need to tell a story with depth as well. Dujardin
does practically all the heavy lifting in this movie, but I just never
got caught up in the drama of his descent or in Peppy&#x27;s attempts to
save him. I just felt like paint by numbers (maybe that&#x27;s why silent
pictures died).<br /><br />So enjoy the craft of the actors, the feel of Hollywood as it
transitions from silent to talkies, but not a great movie. Again
Dujardin deserves an Oscar nomination.
