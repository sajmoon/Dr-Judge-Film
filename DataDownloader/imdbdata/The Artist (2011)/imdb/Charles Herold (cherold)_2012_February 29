When I heard there was a new, silent movie called &#x22;The Artist,&#x22; I
figured it would be one of these super-arty concept movies of the sort
Guy Maddin makes, but it turned out to be pretty much the opposite, a
fun, clever, sprightly valentine to the silent days.<br /><br />The filmmakers are clearly in love with those old movies, and this is a
joyfully movie-obsessed movie, with a story about movie makers and a
lot of clever ideas that toy with or extend the tricks of the silent
film. The movie is full of wonderfully ingenious scenes; a starlet
making love to a coat, an audience reacting to an unseen film scene, a
sound-driven dream sequence.<br /><br />This is also a movie that simple wants to be a fun old-fashioned movie,
hokey plot at all. The movie is French, and it&#x27;s hard to imagine an
American filmmaker creating something as un-ironic as this.<br /><br />The stars are wonderful. The male lead has a Douglas Fairbanks meets
William Powell quality. The female lead completely captures the quality
of stars like &#x22;It girl&#x22; Clara Bow, although she&#x27;s too skinny for the
period. <br /><br />The score is fantastic. The movie starts well and gets better and
better as it progresses. Well worth seeing.
