The Artist is an entertaining film, made as silent both for the special
aesthetic tone it provides and in order to play some good natured
games. Moments of sound season the film and tell the story, that the
star of silent film falls out of favour at the advent of the talkies,
only to be redeemed by the girl who represents his usurper. It&#x27;s
clever, funny and romantic.<br /><br />With one unbeatable principal in Jean Dujardin - Errol Flynn and Gene
Kelly in one smile - and a charming lead lady in B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo, it
works beautifully as a breezy, uncomplicated romance. In mitigation of
his occasional postmodern winks, it&#x27;s clear that Hazanavicius has
imposed some period discipline on the manner in which he has filmed,
with moving camera used only sparingly. The black and white stock
lovingly investigates the texture of its subject: the topography of the
faces of the (often familiar) supporting cast, the grain of costume and
set material, and the high contrast of contemporaneous expressionism.
Ludovic Bource&#x27;s score reflects the melodrama consonant with the period
without simply ignoring the sound world of today...<br /><br />... which brings us onto the most serious caveat of the film. The
Artist is an honest, original film. So why on earth is an extended
extract of Vertigo used to underscore its most serious sequence? There
is very little direct reference to other films of either the period
(either side of 1930) or today, so why one of 1958? There are two
possibilities. First, that someone could think of no better sweeping,
romantic music for the sequence. Which is rather a snub to the hitherto
more than serviceable score from Bource.<br /><br />Second is that the music is designed to reflect thematic ideas in
Vertigo that have some pertinence to The Artist. This I cannot buy: the
references are generic, of a period not a specific film; the
relationship between the characters may involve an imperiled love but
the circumstances surrounding them are simply too distinct.<br /><br />For me the inclusion of the music was a little distracting. I saw the
film with someone else who did not know the music in question and
wasn&#x27;t affected. The spirit of the film is one of a super evening at
the pictures rather than philosophical investigation. As such the film
can be enjoyed at face value and this is how I&#x27;d heartily recommend it.
