When I first saw the trailer for The Artist, it convinced me to go see
the film. I didn&#x27;t know it was a &#x22;silent&#x22; movie. I only found that out
later. Then I became more intrigued. How would they pull this off
without losing the audience? As I sat down in the cinema, nothing could
prepare me for this wonderful movie. I don&#x27;t make a habit of watching
dramas. A trip to the pictures is too expensive for me, so I only go to
see something special. And this was it. Beautifully directed, with a
smart and inventive script, and mesmerizing performances from the
elegant and very funny cast. But as if that wasn&#x27;t enough, something
else happened inside that cinema. Something magical. People stopped
tapping and rustling and talking and... listened. It was the first time
I have ever heard a cinema so silent. This film is genuinely affecting.
Funny, moving, sad, joyous. And a little tap dancing thrown in for good
measure! So my thanks to the filmmakers for such a great evening. And
for those of you who aren&#x27;t sure... go see it for yourself!
