The Artist has garnered a lot of rave reviews based on it&#x27;s simplicity
and charming tale. The story revolves around a successful silent movie
star George Valentin (played with such delightfulness and glee by Jean
Dujardin) who struggles to adapt to the advent of talking pictures. For
those of you who don&#x27;t know, this film is in black and white and is a
(mainly) silent feature.<br /><br />The film opens up in a movie theatre which is playing Valentin&#x27;s latest
hit film. When the film finishes, Valentin and his co-star come onto
stage to accept their applauds and from this point onwards you&#x27;ll
understand the tone and mechanics of the plot. As Valentin laps up the
cheers, through exaggerated physical and comedic movement, you
understand what is clearly going on. It&#x27;s never at all difficult to
follow the action on screen. When he leaves the auditorium a chance
encounter with a young girl changes both their lives. The young girl
Peppy Miller (an aspiring actress) causes a bit of commotion and
catches the eye of our silent film star.<br /><br />With the chance encounter comes the coincidental casting of Peppy
Miller (played by Berenice Bejo) as an extra in Valentin&#x27;s next feature
film, sparks fly as chemistry forms between the two. As their
individual careers take off, the advent of talking movies come of age
but with only one of them embracing the new technology, the other is
left behind and becomes last weeks news.<br /><br />What you probably notice straightaway is that it&#x27;s immensely easy to
follow. With the lack of dialogue (only the occasional title cards pop
up) the acting is at the highest calibre as every emotion, feeling and
thought is conveyed with effortless beguile and subtly. A mention
should go to the dog as the animal plays an important part in the film
and adds certain extra magic to the whole proceedings. It feels light
with many nice comic touches (many come from the performance by the
four legged friend) and even if the film has a predictable arc, it&#x27;s
still very watchable<br /><br />A film shot in 1:33 ratio with a simplistic direction (which does not
mean poor!) it revels in it&#x27;s influences which made cinema what it was
all those years ago. Simple track and pan, close ups and minimal edits
which allows for a masterclass in acting by both leads. There&#x27;s no room
here for flash in the pan jerky camera movements and fast cut edits
(which has hampered modern film efforts of late), the camera simply
focuses on the actors faces and we as the audience are asked to
interpret the emotion and feelings. It&#x27;s the uncomplicated, plain and
simple narrative which is accompanied by it&#x27;s charm and witty rapport.<br /><br />It&#x27;s a joy to behold and a far cry from majority of today&#x27;s modern
blockbusters, where all the skill and craftsmanship from yesteryear&#x27;s
grace our screens. The era is capture with an eye for detail as
costumes, dance moves and mannerisms reflect the period so well (just
wait until you see Peppy&#x27;s audition as an extra!). It&#x27;s a great tribute
to cinema and celebrates a time and era where entertainment was the
main aim and this picture undoubtedly engrosses, enthrals and of course
entertains.
