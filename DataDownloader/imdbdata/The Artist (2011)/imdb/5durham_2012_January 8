Every once in a while a film comes along which is so charming, so
feel-good and so flawless that you leave the cinema feeling happier
than when you went in. The Artist is a once in a generation piece of
film-making which will hopefully pick up the Best Picture Oscar.<br /><br />We&#x27;ve been bombarded with remakes, sequels and based-on-a-comic films
for years now, there&#x27;s a general lack of imagination and an overuse of
CGI. Films sometimes have multiple script-writers and you just know
that things have been tweaked and changed to please preview audiences
of teenagers. The Artist takes us back to a time when cinema was about
entertainment, when new technology was used to improve things rather
than swamp the product with an &#x27;aren&#x27;t we clever with computers?&#x27;
attitude.<br /><br />It has moments of great humour and great poignancy, many of these
moments enhanced by a mere facial expression from the fantastic Jean
Dujardin (Best Actor Oscar with any luck), ably supported by Berenice
Bejo and ....Uggy the Jack Russell in a scene-stealing performance. The
great music score, of necessity due to the lack of dialogue, takes a
central role and it works beautifully.<br /><br />It&#x27;s a lovely film, brilliantly executed and deserves whatever
accolades it will surely gain.
