On the surface &#x27;The Artist&#x27; is a simple love story; a period love story
set during the times of turbulent transition when cinema broke its
silence and acquired a voice. George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) the
swashbuckling star of silent films is unable to make the transition to
talking films and finds himself upstaged by his upstart costar, the
effervescent Peppy Miller (B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo). How Peppy&#x27;s love for him,
ably aided by a totally adorable canine, helps Valentin redeem himself
is the essence of the film. The challenge before the director Michel
Hazanavicius, who has also written the screenplay, is to get all the
emotions - pride, anger, jealousy etc &#x96; typical of a love story, across
to us in a silent film.<br /><br />Yes, &#x27;The Artist&#x27; is a silent film in black and white. It is this
painstakingly constructed retro format that gives a classic texture to
the film. Unusually for a silent film, the inter-titles are very sparse
and the director relies heavily on the music to convey the emotions of
a scene. And the musical score of composer Ludovic Bource, ranging from
sombre symphonies to lilting melodies majestically rises to the
occasion. Since music is the only sound of the film, it leaves a
lasting impression on the mind Sound does make a stunning entry, twice
in fact, during the film and catches us totally by surprise. The first
is a cleverly disguised dream sequence about 30 minutes into the film.
Valentin dreams that he has lost his voice, and how better to convey
this than introducing sound to the inanimate objects! The second
appearance of sound is in the very last minute of the film, when the
director shouts CUT! And you are left with a disconcerting feeling of
having watched a film within a film within a film.<br /><br />&#x27;The Artist&#x27; is anything but a hackneyed love story and there are
layers to be peeled away, if you like, to get under the skin of George
Valentin. Why he does what he does is a mystery and more mysterious is
the transformation wrought by the silent words of a cop, whose mouth is
shown in an astonishing close-up. There are several uncomfortable
questions to be asked and answered, without in anyway diminishing the
enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />But, &#x27;The Artist&#x27; ends sweetly and gives you a feel good factor of love
having triumphed over everything. It is also about the magic of moving
images, the magic so lovingly captured in the numerous shots of anxious
faces glued to the screen. Hazanavicius pays tributes to hoary legends
of cinema by making references to their works. I caught the reference
to Citizen Kane, and if you get this, it will be an icing on a most
delicious cake of cinema.
