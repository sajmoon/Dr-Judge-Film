The Artist (2011)<br /><br />This is a movie Woody Allen would have liked to have made. And if he
had, it wouldn&#x27;t have been his best.<br /><br />A fantasy and a romance, a time trip (with some intentional slippage
with fact), and an homage to silent movies and to early musicals, which
of course were not silent.<br /><br />The leading man is tremendously alive and talented, though he has that
French leading man quality that American audiences do not quite warm up
to. The leading woman is the kind of French woman all audiences
love--full of life, an over-sized smile, a big heart.<br /><br />I think silent movie fans will be torn. I mean, this is essentially a
silent movie, but anyone familiar with silents from before 1927 will
know a different kind of intensity and sophistication. Even a different
and better kind of plot. To some extent, this dumbs up (no pun
intended) the silent movie aura, making fun of the industry, turning
meaningful plots into clich&#xE9;s. Even as visually beautiful as this movie
is, it doesn&#x27;t match the best of the old silent films for depth and
surprise, at least at times.<br /><br />But then, &#x22;The Artist&#x22; does pull off a relatively rare feat, making the
most of what seemed like a genre long gone. It doesn&#x27;t use affected
tricks like add scratches to the film or extra camera shake. In fact,
there are little techniques that are wholly modern, like the very slow
tracking-in shot when a character is going through some important
thought or transition (this has become a standard, almost inevitable
technique in the last 20 years).<br /><br />I&#x27;m not talking plot because the plot is almost insignificant. It&#x27;s
fun, it&#x27;s warm. And it&#x27;s a rehash of a lot of man meets young pretty
girl who then makes it in the world of theater, or dance, or yes, the
movies. And there are so many references to that other, better, homage
to silent films, &#x22;Singin&#x27; in the Rain,&#x22; it&#x27;s almost painful. Or just
sheer lightweight fun.<br /><br />I didn&#x27;t really love this movie, as you can tell, and I really love
movies. It&#x27;s really well made, sincerely artistic in its own 2011 way,
and enjoyable. The sold out audience where I saw it last night loved it
and applauded at the end. That&#x27;s where most people are at, and if you
go, you&#x27;ll be happy. But I&#x27;ll throw in that if you really do like the
silent film aspects, and not just the referring to silent films as a
kind of homage, you should look at some of the great ones from the
1920s. Really, truly, originally great ones.
