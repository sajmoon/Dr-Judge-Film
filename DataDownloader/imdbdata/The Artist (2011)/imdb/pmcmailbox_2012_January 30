I was quite impatient to watch this movie. To make the story short, I
was very disappointed by it. I was expecting much more since the
critics are so amazing and the rewards are so many to glorify this
film. I asked myself a question after finishing viewing the movie: What
makes this movie so boring? I think the answer is that I have seen most
if not all the classics of non speaking movies, the Jazz Singer, all
the Charles Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, Gloria Swanson, the
Cecile B DeMille collection, Fritz Lang, the Cabinet of doctor
Caligari, etc, etc.... The Artist is a boring movie, nothing else,
nothing more. In my opinion it doesn&#x27;t deserve the awards and critics
it is receiving.<br /><br />Good movie for bed time.
