French director Michel Hazanavicius&#x27;s beautifully self-contained film
manages both to pay homage to the style and structure of silent films
while still telling a fresh and warm story that succeeds as a modern
film on its own merit. It is a silent movie not just in the absence of
dialogue but in the entirety of its look and feel, and that makes it
all that much better. Everything worked: the titles (in English), the
squarer screen aspect, the music, and the acting.<br /><br />The homage is never less than respectful. It succeeds in being
charming, funny, melancholy, and sweet all without being derivative or
striking a false note. And by setting the story at the end of the
silent era and the transition to talkies, The Artist becomes a
wonderful complement to Singing in the Rain.<br /><br />Jean Dujardin, who won the Best Actor award at Cannes, could easily
earn a Best Actor Oscar nomination. As the silent film &#x22;artist&#x22; who
glides through his life, he is smooth, stylish, amusing, and amused.
And as the film moves forward in time, his characterization remains
compelling. B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo, Hazanavicius&#x27;s wife and collaborator, is
almost his equal as the young &#x22;peppy&#x22; ing&#xE9;nue ready to launch her
career. John Goodman is equally good as the head of their studio.<br /><br />I say &#x22;almost perfect&#x22; because I thought the director could have cut
six to ten minutes from the movie&#x27;s second half. But that&#x27;s a small nit
to pick. This is an outstanding film. I don&#x27;t see many movies more than
once, but this is one I will.
