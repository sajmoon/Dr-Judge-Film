Seeing this film was one of the highlights of my move-going life. It&#x27;s
perfect: not a shot or sequence wasted or forced. And the acting is
uniformly superb. In addition, the cinematography is glorious.
Moreover, the finale is stunning. Unfortunately,as with any great
success, this film has attracted some detractors. Sadly, their comments
are typically rants that essentially ignore the work itself such as &#x22;I
hate silent film&#x22; and &#x22;This is not what life in the 1920s was really
like.&#x22; I will admit that I&#x27;ve been an incurable fan of silent film
since I witnessed my first one in the mid-1980s (Chaplin&#x27;s &#x22;City
Lights&#x22;), so much so that my view of film as a medium has never been
the same. However, ignore the baseless negative commentary, go see this
masterpiece (this wonderful homage to all that was silent cinema), and
be completely spellbound and enraptured in a darkened theater like you
never have before.
