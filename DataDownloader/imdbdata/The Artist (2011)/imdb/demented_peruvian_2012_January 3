&#x22;The Artist&#x22; unfortunately cannot be reviewed at this moment in time
without being aware of the hype manufactured by the Weinstein brothers
- the producers of good-but-not-great movies that muscle their way into
all of the award races. Unfortunately, as is usually the case with the
Weinstein movies, it falls short of expectations.<br /><br />On its own, &#x22;The Artist&#x22; is a fun experiment: let&#x27;s shoot a silent
black and white film, using many of the mechanisms of that film era,
from cinematography to screenplay. In particular it imitates that
romantic films of the time, as opposed to the more influential satires
and fantasy/horror films. It goes as far as incorporating a variation
on &#x22;Lassie&#x22;. The actors are charming and there are some interesting
metaphorical shots. It is clever at times, amusing and funny at turns,
cheesy at others, mildly suspenseful towards the end, but consistent in
its style, and it delivers on the romance. The few moments of sound
provide such a contrast to the world of silent film (are we in a
self-aware movie?) that they become the most memorable and admirable
parts of the film.<br /><br />However, it is so light that it would make Clara Bowen&#x27;s &#x22;It&#x22; seem as
heavy as &#x22;Intolerance&#x22;. It is intentionally clich&#xE9;d, but does not do
anything with its references; we are expected to accept them as if we
were a 1928 audience. We must accept the on screen relationships as
such, and the characters do not escape beyond the 2-dimensional. There
is little advantage taken of modern technology to develop more
elaborate scenes.<br /><br />&#x22;The Artist&#x22; succeeds as a moderately fun recreation of 1920s and early
1930s cinema. However, the experiment perhaps would have been more
interesting had the silent treatment been given to a modern story or to
a deeper screenplay.
