This film is one of the most refreshing I have seen in a long time. A
slight reworking of the &#x27;Star is Born&#x27; tale but so much more. The
chemistry between the two main actors (and the dog) simmers gently. The
scene when filming take after take is probably the most sensitive and
evocative expose of falling in love I have ever seen. All the scenes
are well worked and superbly directed and filmed, some scenes are just
exquisite. All the actors create subtle but powerful roles with no ego
inflected cameos. Oh! and it is in black and white and a silent movie.
but the use and timing of sound is remarkable. And you will want a Jack
Russel after seeing this.
