Well, this movie was... okay. Not great, not terrible. It&#x27;s an
interesting idea to try making a silent film (in fact, I thought the
places where the film did use sound effects were rather silly), but I
think they should have tried to make a more substantial movie instead
of relying on the style as a gimmick. The plot was rather thin for the
most part and parts of it seemed a bit overwrought. I had no particular
problems with the acting, at least not with the lead parts, but there
wasn&#x27;t a whole lot of interest to the characters because their roles
were so one-dimensional. I&#x27;d be interested to see what could be done
with silent films if the filmmakers weren&#x27;t trapped in the idea of
making some kind of &#x22;tribute&#x22; instead of adding something of their own
to the work.
