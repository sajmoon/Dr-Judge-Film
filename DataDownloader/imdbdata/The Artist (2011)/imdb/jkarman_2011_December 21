This review will not be useful unless you&#x27;re a regular viewer of
original silent movies (which some people still seek and find to view).
For those who aren&#x27;t regular viewers of this lost art, it will be an
enjoyable novelty. It is a good story, but too slow, and stretched out
too far. I&#x27;m not comparing it to movies from the teens, but am to
movies from the twenties, when the silents became a refined art. If you
are a silent movie fan, that purchases, and views silent DVDs, be
prepared for disappointment. It did have a rather good musical score
which is worth mentioning. The dog in the movie (in my opinion) steals
the show.
