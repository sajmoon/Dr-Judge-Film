A film like The Artist doesn&#x27;t come along very often, but when they do
sometimes to novelty can be overrated, not here, after viewing The
Artist I think it lives up to any type of hype that is associated with
it, it exceeded all my expectations. The lead actor is really really
exceptional, his suave face and charisma is so fitting for the 1920&#x27;s
and he has an extremely handsome face to match, Berenice Bejo is just
darling as it girl Peppy Miller, both actors are so extremely well cast
that it just wouldn&#x27;t have worked with anyone but them, and the
supporting cast do well in their roles, in particular Missi Pyle.<br /><br />I am a fan of silent films so I&#x27;m pretty easy to please when it comes
to watching a silent film but even non enthusiasts would be charmed by
this lovely film. Also worth mentioning is the scene stealer, the dog,
hands down the greatest animal in film ever. This film is very funny,
from the get go I was smiling and was charmed off my socks. The
production is perfect, everything is recreated exactly the way it would
have been back in the flapper days, the music, the costuming,
everything is perfection.<br /><br />After seeing The Artist it gives me faith that films like Return To
Babylon could finally get released, how great it would be to see that
film on a big screen, so hopefully with the success of this it may
finally after so many years get a release.<br /><br />Just watch and enjoy, you&#x27;d have to be a serious grump if you couldn&#x27;t
just go with it. Terrific.
