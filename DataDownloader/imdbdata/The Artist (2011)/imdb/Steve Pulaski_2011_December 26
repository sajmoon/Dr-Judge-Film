What could&#x27;ve derailed into a drab and dry spectacle, perfectly
executes everything it tries to accomplish in a serious and fun way.
The Artist is an amazing homage to the classic silent films from the
twenties and thirties, respectively. They are some of the simplest
films, but pack so much in their context it&#x27;s easy to miss a few beats.<br /><br />The idea of silent cinema is sketchy in 2011, but thankfully, The
Artist never tries to present itself as a tongue in cheek parody or a
goofy tribute. It is serious in its presentation and wants nothing more
than to show that captivating cinema still exists and can work work
wonders if done properly. Maybe it&#x27;s because I have shot two silent
films in the last year and am sympathetic to all the effort it takes to
actually create one.<br /><br />The silent films I shot were for a Television class I took last year.
They are nothing special and are pretty cheaply made. I loosely based
it off a situation that really happened to my friend and I, and added a
nice KISS song and threw in a few plot twists. It wasn&#x27;t in black and
white, and the editing wasn&#x27;t this tight. I am open to the idea of more
now that I have been schooled watching The Artist.<br /><br />Being that Jean Dujardin is a gifted physical actor and his appearance
mirrors a real-life actor from the silent era only adds to the many
reasons why The Artist succeeds on so many levels. He plays George
Valentin, a silent film actor who has starred in many films over the
course of the twenties with his scene stealing Jack Russell Terrier.
Sadly, it&#x27;s now 1927 and the silent film studios are suffering because
a new fad of films that include sound, called Talkies, are the big
thing.<br /><br />One day when George is being swarmed by the paparazzi, a woman gets
pushed into him by accident. Instead of acting infuriated, which I can
see many celebrities being now, he embraces the abrupt entry of the
woman and poses for several pictures with her. The woman is then
discovered to be Peppy Miller, played by the engaging and utterly
beautiful B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo. George is so wooed by Miller&#x27;s attitude and
beauty that he auditions her for a role in his new film. After that,
Peppy becomes more and more famous through roles of all different sizes
in Talkies.<br /><br />Keep in mind, all this action, excitement, and suspense is captured
through black and white film, many musical numbers, and a lens not in
the typical widescreen format. Though the film is so engaging, I did
not forget its silent nature but I do believe it is possible to forget
the film lacks in dialog. Some very impressed moviegoers will be lost
in the film&#x27;s story and might be in for a rude awakening before the
credits roll.<br /><br />The Artist is an enriching and delightful movie experience. Some will
grow tired of the aspect but I can see many embracing it and craving
more. The film has enough well-delivered action to not be called &#x22;one
note,&#x22; and enough clever plot points to prevent the word &#x22;monotony&#x22;
from coming in. It&#x27;s subtle in its presence but massively entertaining
in its delivery.<br /><br />Starring: Jean Dujardin, B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo, and John Goodman. Directed by:
Michel Hazanavicius.
