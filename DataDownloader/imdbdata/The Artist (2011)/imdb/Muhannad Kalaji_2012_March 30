its simply very pleasant, extremely well done and marvelous acting by
both stars<br /><br />this proves the theory that a great movie dose not necessarily needs
visual &#x26; audio effects and that&#x27;s what i loved about this movie
nowadays you hardly come across a movie that computers did not had a
big stake in it, then this movie comes to shatter all this commercial
hunger for visual effects.<br /><br />the story is very good classic, and the acting is just &#x22;oh my God&#x22; i
loved every minute of it; it offers great entertainment, humor, and
drama.<br /><br />just when we though that such movies were long gone, the director comes
and slam this in Hollywood face.<br /><br />also what i loved in this movie; that a successful movie dose not
necessarily needs to be American ! yah can you believe it ? other folks
who are not American can manufacture Amazing movies<br /><br />i think after this one i will cut back on the American movies and try
to catch a couple of European ones <br /><br />this movie is a real &#x22;Must See&#x22; you&#x27;ll find it brilliant and so
original <br /><br />and before i wrap this up; i would like to tell the French star: is
this guy for real ! he is a perfect perfect match for the role and he
really looks like 30&#x27;s &#x26; 40&#x27;s like
