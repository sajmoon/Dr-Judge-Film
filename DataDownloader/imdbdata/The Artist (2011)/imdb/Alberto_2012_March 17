This film is extraordinary, it stands out from the crowd. Only a gifted
mind can create such a masterpiece. I loved the director&#x27;s perspective
of the Cinema at that time, a genuine appreciation of silent movies.<br /><br />&#x27;The Artist&#x27; describes life itself perfectly, it shows how the changing
and cruel society treats the human being and how difficult is to come
through an inability. Both the main actors are magnificent in their
roles. Jean Dujardin&#x27;s lovely smile and B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo&#x27;s classic beauty
are remarkable. A special mention for the dog too.<br /><br />Ironically, with this film, the French have scored a great goal against
the massive American film industry.
