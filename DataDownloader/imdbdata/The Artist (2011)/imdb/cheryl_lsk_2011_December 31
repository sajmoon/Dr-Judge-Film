You know you&#x27;ve seen a masterpiece when you walk out of a film and shed
tears of joy or felt something stir within your soul. This is just the
show which will make you glad that someone has the passion to make a
black &#x26; white silent film and share it with the world.<br /><br />I was thoroughly blown away by the leads and practically everyone else
in the film who has managed to convey their feelings, humor, anguish,
anger etc just with their facial expressions. In modern times where
movies are heading towards high definition IMAX, CGI and what not, a
black and white seems like a step back, much less a silent one. But
this film is definitely worth your time if you&#x27;re a fan of classics.
Easy to comprehend and very enjoyable to watch. It&#x27;s no wonder this
film is so highly lauded and expected to achieve more at the golden
globes and Oscars.<br /><br />I just wonder if more films like this that seem to have moments of
magic will continue to be produced.
