2012_February 8 
After waiting for about 2 months since I first watched the trailer and
more than 5 since I first heard about it, I finally managed to watch
&#x22;The Artist&#x22;. Between then and the night before last, I&#x27;ve grown
accustomed to hearing only the superlatives and most glorious
adjectives in reference to the movie. Although none from my close
friends, I am referring to my favourite pastimes like Facebook,
Twitter, American Cinematography Magazine, Total Film, Time Magazine to
just name a few. Apart from setting unimaginable expectations in the
sub conscious, it did generate a sense of delirious excitement in me,
while I sat down for the experience. Here&#x27;s what I think, how it fared.<br /><br />The Artist is an accomplished piece of work that should / would appeal
to a wide spectrum of cine goers across the world. But &#x22;a lump in the
throat&#x22; is reserved for the absolute fanatic of the craft. In my books,
I consider myself a member of such a make belief club. Before I indulge
in the sparkles and the fireworks, the movie managed to create while
watching it and right after, let me get into some of the facts.This is
as much as some may hate to accept, is a French production shot on
location in Los Angeles and includes various craftsmen from both French
cinema and Hollywood. But in true heart and soul this is an American
story of the industry that sells dreams and most successfully so.There
have been many stories about it in the past and so will be in future;
that may have or will manage to tell it successfully and some not so
much. The Artist, I perceive will have a special place amongst them
all, a first among equals if You&#x27;d like. At a time, where the advent
and renaissance of &#x22;Social Media&#x22; has brought fans of cinema and the
ones who don the grease paints to unbelievable and sometimes
unacceptable proximities, the process has inadvertently led to
considerable degeneration of the mist that surrounds them and their
lives outside the spot light, between &#x22;cut&#x22; and &#x22;action&#x22;. And at such
times, &#x22;The Artist&#x22; is a breath of fresh air and works as a reminiscent
of what movies right after its conception, stood for. A celebration of
one such art form, from one such factory that has outlived itself in
many ways in the past millennium. he story itself is about an
indispensable act of nature, &#x22;change&#x22; and how it affects the one&#x27;s who
take success and in this case fame and admiration for permanency or as
some would call it, granted. In life as much as in the world of
glamour, nothing is constant. The protagonist&#x27;s fights with his inner
demons about accepting change is projected in the simplest of manners
which is why it works. Research of how it worked in the 1920&#x2032;s and
technical excellence in achieving the feel of those times more than the
costume, make up and body language which we have come to expect of
movies these days, makes it a product par excellence. The fact that the
makers shot it at 22 fps as opposed to the standard 24 fps, helped them
achieve what they did and is a serious case in point. Although its USP,
&#x22;a silent film&#x22; will manage to draw the crowds and more so with all the
nominations it has been getting, what would make them savour the
experience is, how good it is, at it. Michel Hazanavicius who held this
dream / passion project close to his heart for long before it came true
chose his confidants for the lead roles, Jean Dujardin &#x26; Berenice Bejo
(who also happens to be his better half). They have achieved major
success in the OSS 117 series in France before this. Along with that
some very familiar faces that constitutes the important players list
includes the likes of John Goodman &#x26; James Cromwell who by the way pull
off excellent character roles pivotal to the story line. Special
mention to Uggy the Dog, who by the way has his own IMDb page now. But
by and large Jean Dujardin with his impeccable sense of timing besides
an affable charm, the original score produced by Lodovic Bource and
performed by Brussels Philharmonic and most of all, Michel Hazanavicius
who did not have to depend only on intertiles to tell a silent story,
should be held high, very high in respect to what they have given us,
the fans. Come February 26th, people who watch movies and follow them
for what it is worth, will wait to see if &#x22;The Artist&#x22; stakes claims at
the 10 Oscar categories it has been nominated for (including BEST
Picture). My only concern is, people should not give it a miss if it
does not get some of them &#x22;Gold Statuettes&#x22; in the bag because for
once, let&#x27;s not make The Academy the yardstick of its excellence and
achievements. Martin Scorsese for all I care should have earned it long
before for far better works than &#x22;The Departed&#x22;, for which he did. Lets
for once, stand up and applaud &#x22;The Artist&#x22; wherever You are, until it
deafens the ears that have grown accustomed to appreciation of the
mediocre, because this one is not it. It is quiet truly and literally
if I may, in a league of its own.<br /><br />Check out more review http://mayurdeep.com
