It says it all.<br /><br />It&#x27;s a good mix between music, good acting and filming. Is it worth to
watch? yes. Is it worth to be nominated to that many academy awards? no<br /><br />It&#x27;s just a movie that professionals will enjoy because of many winks
to classic American movies. And maybe remind them how it got made at
its beginning. Maybe they will remember Errol Flynn or Clark Gable&#x27;s
moustache<br /><br />To the others, even the trailer tells the whole story so no big
explosion at the end nor Chuck Norris saving the world on a spaceshift.
There s no big robot coming back from the future . In France, a very
popular chocolate brand had a motto &#x22;quelques grammes de finesse dans
un monde de brutes&#x22; &#x22; a few grams of finess in a brutal world&#x22; I truly
believe that is what they achieved<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie but I take it as an essay and not a masterpiece
