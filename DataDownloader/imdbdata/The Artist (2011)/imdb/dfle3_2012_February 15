I&#x27;m guessing that the world has been screaming out for silent, black
and white movies this year in the wake of slow and plodding cinema
releases recently like &#x22;Hugo&#x22; and &#x22;Tinker, tailor, soldier, spy&#x22;.<br /><br />This movie deals with the historical transition from silent movies to
&#x22;talkies&#x22;, in the late 1920s, and the effects that this has on an
established star of the silent movie era (George Valentin, played by
Jean Dujardin).<br /><br />Even though this movie is in black and white and is, for the most part,
silent, it&#x27;s entertaining enough, in its own way. Dujardin must be a
good actor, because in one scene, in front of a mirror with an
attractive woman, he is actually looking at the woman&#x27;s reflection and
not himself in the mirror...the narcissistic nature of the acting
profession means that that sight is as rare as hen&#x27;s teeth. He is also
amusing in the moments where he readies himself to be filmed for a
scene. The cast do tend to recreate the acting styles of the silent era
and one could say, perhaps, that Dujardin&#x27;s eyebrows are more
expressive than Laurence Olivier&#x27;s ever were...that&#x27;s a joke...not in
the sense that Olivier&#x27;s eyebrows were peerless...never
mind...Dujardin&#x27;s face is quite ye olde expressive, even if his
eyebrows may not be...which I don&#x27;t remember in any case!<br /><br />I did enjoy the scene where rising star Peppy Miller (played by
B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo) has a moment with Valentin&#x27;s coat. Nice.<br /><br />The film does lightly touch on some significant moments of the era,
like the Other event of 1929.<br /><br />Some people just seem born for this era of filmmaking...can you imagine
how big a star Fran Drescher could have been at that time?<br /><br />Anyway, this movie has some good physical comedy and &#x22;lines&#x22;. Many
critics are mentioning the dog as being a star of this movie.<br /><br />Did manage to predict things in this movie...e.g. the kind of thing to
happen when the feather dropped...what was in that locked box in
Valentin&#x27;s house.<br /><br />If there is actual sound recording of the cast of this movie acting,
that might be fun as a DVD extra for this movie...I would definitely
give that a burl!
