When The Artist premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May, it opened
to an enthusiastic reception that continued to spread over to the U.S.
Now hat I see it, it isn&#x27;t hard for me to see why it&#x27;s been bringing
audiences to their feet, and claiming Best Picture awards left and
right.<br /><br />The Artist was a passion project for director Michel Hazanavicius. He&#x27;d
long wanted to make a film inspired by the black &#x26; white silent movies
of the 1920&#x27;s and early 30&#x27;s. There&#x27;s barely any audible dialogue or
sound effects in the whole film besides music. The movie&#x27;s first
ambient sound effects aren&#x27;t heard until half an hour through the film,
and they aren&#x27;t followed by any more until a full hour later. This is
where Hazanavicius specifically lets his writing and direction take
center stage.<br /><br />Some may call it incredibly flashy, but I actually find the direction
to be quite subtle. Co-working as both a director and film editor,
Hazanavicius paces the movie at the exact rate it always needs. He
pieces together his excellent cast&#x27;s performances with style, and knows
when to make a quick cut, whether it be to another person or an
inter-title. But he also knows when to slow things down, to let the
audience absorb the detail of the film, such as the pleasant
cinematography and lovely costumes, and to let a shot go uninterrupted
and let Ludovic Bource&#x27;s elegant, if not always so subtle, musical
score do the storytelling. This is a thematically and technically
excellent score, as Bource relishes in the lightly romanticized and
melodramatic orchestrations inspired by those from the golden age of
Hollywood.<br /><br />What Hazanavicius ultimately excels at best is his terrific cast.
There&#x27;s a whole slew of outstanding performances in this picture that
perform perfectly, and manage to tell us almost a whole story without
saying a single word: including great supporting roles by John Goodman,
James Cromwell, and Penelope Ann Miller. Standout notices go to Jean
Dujardin, whose natural charisma, sincerity, and incredible array of
emotion in the role of George Valentin is enough to carry the whole
film on its own. Berenice Bejo, on top of being so utterly beautiful,
gives a masterstroke portrayal as the enthusiastic Peppy Miller, never
uttering a single line, but charming us and placing us under an
irresistible spell. As if that weren&#x27;t enough, Uggie the dog, who plays
Valentin&#x27;s faithful pet, is the most adorable thing I&#x27;ve seen all year.
Applause is most richly deserved.<br /><br />**** out of ****
