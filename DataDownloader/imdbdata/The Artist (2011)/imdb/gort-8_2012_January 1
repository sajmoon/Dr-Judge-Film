Hollywood has never reconciled with its silent past. Most of the
infrastructure that supports the 21st century film industry, from film
technique to the studios themselves, have their roots in the silent
era. This film (and Martin Scorcesse&#x27;s Hugo) helps to bridge that gap
and does it brilliantly. <br /><br />The two leads, Jean Dujardin and B&#xE9;r&#xE9;nice Bejo, are spot on perfect in
their performances. The direction of Michel Hazanavicius was pristine. <br /><br />We&#x27;re afforded glimpses of the lives of Douglas Fairbanks, John
Gilbert, Gretta Garbo and other silent luminaries in this story of how
Hollywood learned to talk. <br /><br />This story is not exclusively for young or old, male or female, or any
particular nationality. It&#x27;s for anyone who loves cinema.
