2012_March 4 
It all started last Christmas when I, like many others started hearing
a lot of hoo-ha about this new film coming out called The Artist which
was silent, black and white, and up for all sorts of prestigious
awards. I decided to give it a chance even though I couldn&#x27;t really
imagine how it could possibly be as good as all that, of course unless
they brought something new and exciting to the silent picture, for why
else would we have moved onto talkie films? To my utmost dismay, The
Artist not only turned out to be ultimately disappointing, bringing
nothing new to the table but also a member of that most dreaded genre-
the tribute film. In other words, the type of film that says &#x27;we&#x27;ve run
out of ideas so let&#x27;s just rehash old ideas and call it homage&#x27;. The
tribute film is even worse than the remake and just one step up from
clip shows in terms of unoriginality; and we all know how much we hate
clip shows! I can just about understand tribute bands, they make sense.
For instance, you want the Beatles live for your party, so you book a
Beatles tribute band- not as good as the real thing but better than a
CD. For the rest of this review please visit my blog!
