I loved this film. The lead character was charming, and made me
understand completely what my parents and grandparents found so
interesting about the cinema of their day. This film never really let
me go, from beginning to end. It had a very specific tone, that was
never violated (except for a purpose), yet never did I feel it was
boring. Its surprises were (usually) subtle, probably appreciated more
by those familiar with early cinema. Yet, even those who aren&#x27;t, could
be drawn into the story. Seems like everyone loves this film, and so
there is little I can say about this film that hasn&#x27;t been said. I did
feel there was an underlying theme that those who don&#x27;t love themselves
can be loved and admired by everyone, but still have a really hard time
loving themselves and others.<br /><br />One other thing I would comment on is the use of the Bernard Herrmann
score during a segment of the film. I thought it was an amazingly
intelligent use of the music. The scene was getting just on the edge of
being too much for the overall tone of the film, and the score&#x27;s use
telegraphed intensity, yet, because it was a recognizable score used in
a previous specific dramatic context, it was almost tongue in cheek,
and lightened the mood just enough &#x96; almost to melodrama &#x96; without
losing the serious drama. Honestly, it made me LMAO, while still caring
about the character&#x27;s situation. I would dare to say Bernard Herrmann
would have loved it too.
