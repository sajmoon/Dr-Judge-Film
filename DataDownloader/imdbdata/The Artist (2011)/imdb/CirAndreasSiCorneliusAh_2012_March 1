It should be titled &#x22;The Emperor&#x27;s New Film&#x22;. Contrary to what some of
you may believe, the actors that lived in the time of the silent films
actually did speak, could hear sounds, and the world was actually in
color. For a movie to accurately portray their lives and how they were
affected by the advent of speaking films it would have to represent
their real lives, not the result of what their lives would have been
without color or sound. To appreciate the films of the silent era, you
watch those films. To create a farce such as this to feed the arrogant
intellectuals that have so much power in the movie industry and the
presentation of paid for awards is insulting to the people that truly
appreciated the art of the silent era. What is next? Will we go to a
theater to see a blank screen and a sound only version of a film
representing the real lives of old time radio show personalities? This
was just an insulting attempt to show that today we can make a better
silent film than they did originally.
