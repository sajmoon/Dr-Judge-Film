This film belongs in the past. It has no originality whatsoever, and
tells a story not worth being told. Despite whatever nostalgic feelings
it gives you, it offers nothing new. Frankly I find it disrespectful
that a french film would even be nominated, since they have their own
awards. Considering its competition in the eyes of the Academy its not
surprising though, as this was one of the worst years for films period.
I don&#x27;t know when the Academy stopped caring about entertainment,
creativity, quality film making, or dramatic intelligence, but its
clear now that they don&#x27;t. The Oscars have lost all their merit, after
so many years of shameful political nominations, and attention grabs,
they just don&#x27;t mean anything anymore. At least people can still make
up their own minds on what a good movie is, this is just my opinion,
and I don&#x27;t care what you think about it, in fact you shouldn&#x27;t even
have an opinion about my opinion. Awful movie, 80 years too late. I&#x27;d
put this on the boards instead but I don&#x27;t need to read your deluded
thoughts. 0/10.
