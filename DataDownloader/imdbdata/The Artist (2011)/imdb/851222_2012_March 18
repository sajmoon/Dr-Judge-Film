Greetings from Lithuania.<br /><br />Was is a good idea to make a silent black&#x26;white movie in the age of
&#x22;Avatar&#x22;? - yes, (if you have an idea, passion to do this and not a lot
of money). Is &#x22;The Artist&#x22; a good movie? - definitely. Is it worth of
the awards it won? - definitely. Now the main question - was it wort of
winning the Oscar for the Best Movie of the year? In my opinion - no.<br /><br />As i said, &#x22;The Artist&#x22; is great movie, charming movie, made with a
good idea, wonderful performances of two leading actors, and with a
nice score. And yet, i would prefer &#x22;The Descendants&#x22; of taking home
the Oscar for a best movie. It&#x27;s when i first time heard all the buzz
about &#x22;The Artist&#x22;, and the love it portraits to Hollywood&#x27;s &#x22;history&#x22;,
i could bet on everything that we already have a Best Oscar winner for
2011. It&#x27;s a &#x22;perfect&#x22; winner. After watching it, i disagree with this
award. Why? Here comes an ugly word for a movie review - it&#x27;s just
&#x22;small&#x22;. The world&#x27;s best film of the year never ever should look
&#x22;small&#x22;. <br /><br />And yet, i truly recommending to see this movie to anyone who doesn&#x27;t
scare to spend an hour and a half with a silent black&#x26;white movie, you
will have a really good time. And Bravo to Jean Dujardin - his
performance blew my away. <br /><br />By the way, just the fact, Michel Hazanavicius is a real native form
Lithuania.
