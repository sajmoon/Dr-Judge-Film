The Artist is going to win best picture. Don&#x27;t try and fool yourselves
people, this film is going to win. True Hugo was nominated for more
awards, but this film has been so critically praised that Hugo barely
stands a chance.<br /><br />Not that I&#x27;m really complaining, because I really did enjoy this film.
I went into it, just hoping for an entertaining movie, and that&#x27;s what
I got. I was invested in the story, I enjoyed the characters, it was
funny at times, truly heart breaking at times, and had me interested
throughout it&#x27;s running time. The movie thankfully isn&#x27;t too long,
because if it was it would have gotten on my nerves near the end, but
an hour and a half is perfect for this film.<br /><br />The actors do a great job even though they are not able to speak. The
camera work is great, it has a beautiful score, and it&#x27;s just a flat
out fun movie to watch.<br /><br />Yet despite that, the only reason this is even nominated for best
picture is because of the fact that it&#x27;s a silent film in 2011. It&#x27;s a
great film, but it&#x27;s that gimmick that is giving it the praise. This
film would not be the Holy Grail of the Academy Awards if it wasn&#x27;t a
silent film in 2011.<br /><br />The Artist is a great film, its funny, dramatic, entertaining...but in
the end, it&#x27;s still a gimmick movie.
