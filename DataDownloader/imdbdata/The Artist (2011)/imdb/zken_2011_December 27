Once again, there is a wonderful re-birth of the film industry, just
when it has been declared dead and buried. And for those of us ready
for a real holiday surprise, this is it. And leave it to the FRENCH to
produce such a wonderful treat. And it is a sure bet that this film may
well challenge the big Hollywood fat cats as a BEST picture that cost a
fraction of their films. That said, will Americans who don&#x27;t seem to
respond to most things &#x22;foreeen&#x22; take to this charming and simple piece
of pure celluloid fun, filled with obscure references and lovingly
portrayed touches from what must be a life time of film watching by the
director? And here is the rub, the movie has a clear subtext about
technological change that makes it a clear follow-up to Modern Times.
For the biggest challenge facing our society is portrayed right
here-how can we all make our way in a world that is changing by the
minute? In the end we are left with the wonderful sense of warmth and
love that is so typically FRENCH. Ah, l&#x27;amour, I love it. And yes, our
fantasies about life are this real. Mother, you were right, everything
will be fine.
