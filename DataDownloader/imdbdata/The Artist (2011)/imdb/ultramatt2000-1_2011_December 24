I was originally going to see THE MUPPETS today with my brother, but it
wasn&#x27;t playing due to changes with the digital projection. He wanted to
see SHERLOCK HOLMES 2, but I wanted to see THE ARTIST. In the end he
agreed and my brother watched SHERLOCK HOLMES 2 and I watched THE
ARTIST.<br /><br />In a time where we are bombarded with movies that exploit subjects like
9-11, the war on terror or the financial crisis. Or sequels, remakes,
reboots, re-imaginings or adaptations of cartoons, TV Shows, and comic
books (ad nauseum). This one is original and is a throwback to the
classic movies of the 1920&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s. It is one of those movies that
takes you back to the good old days when there was fun and originality.
It is good clean fun (except for one scene where there&#x27;s an obscene
finger gesture that was shown briefly). It is about George Valentin, a
silent movie actor, who has now been washed up because of sound and the
woman who admired him named Peppy Miller. We see him in the peak of his
fame to his downfall and comeback.<br /><br />It is a feel good movie. I highly recommend it. If you enjoy that film,
then I recommend another movie, CALL OF THE CTHULHU (2005). Because it
is made in the style of a silent movie and the special effects are done
with stop-motion animation.<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for some disturbing images and one obscene finger gesture.
But it is worth watching.<br /><br />Twas Charlton Heston in THE OMEGA MAN who said, &#x22;They don&#x27;t make
pictures the way they used to.&#x22; Guess again. If you think Hollywood is
the only one that is cooking up retro-style movies, so are independent
filmmakers.
