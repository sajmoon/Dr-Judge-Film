From the film's opening to it's conclusion I was hooked. What at first
appears to be a glorification of the gangster lifestyle gradually evolves
into a cautionary tale, graphically depicting the violence and treachery of
this way of life. Based on the experiences of real-life ex-gangster Henry
Hill, one-time associate of New York's Luchese crime family, the film gives
an inside look at organized crime as it really is. Joe Pesci as the
murderous Tommy DeVito absolutely steals the show. It is worth the price of
the DVD just to see this talented and versatile performer in action. Ray
Liotta gives a good performance as Henry Hill, but is overshadowed by
Lorraine Bracco, who plays Henry's over-the-top wife Karen. Robert DeNiro's
performance is so-so. Overall, I'd rate this an 8.5/10.
