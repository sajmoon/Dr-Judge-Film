I live in Emeryville, California (near SF, CA, which is more well known than
Emeryville), and one of my favorite ways to spend a couple of hours is to
head over to Everett&amp;Jones for Ribs and watch Goodfellas. From the
beginning, it draws you in to the mafia life following Henry Hill (Ray
Liotta) rise from childhood dreams of being a gangster along with Jimmy
Conway (Robert DeNiro), and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci in an amazing role).
From the beginning, Scorsese captures the romance and logic of being a
gangster. Young Henry Hill saw the beauty of it all. &quot;It was out of respect&quot;
he says, when kids carried his mother's groceries all the way home for her.
&quot;It was better than being president&quot;, he says. And why not? Gangsters seemed
immune to police, law, having to pay bills. That's the beauty that draws you
in. <br /><br />Pesci plays the role of a hot-tempered gangster which is Robin Hood
on-target. You can tell early on that this is a man who probably got stepped
on when younger, and craved the respect given to gangsters. That makes him
the most volatile of the trio since he constantly wants the respect from
everyone, but sometimes doesn't command it. <br /><br />DeNiro is, not surprisingly, great as Jimmy Conway, but between the central
role that Liotta has and the character Pesci plays, DeNiro's character
doesn't really stand out. That's not to say DeNiro didn't play the character
well, just that the nature of his character, IMO, wasn't meant to stick
out.<br /><br />The music is a wonderful complement to the story. The fluid camera shots are
amazing, especially after multiple viewings. There's one in particular where
it follows Henry and Karen on their first real date. It's amazing. There's
also another scene where the piano exit of Layla plays in the background.
It's one of my favorites in the movie.<br /><br />Geez, what else can be said. Great acting by everyone. The story flows like
water. The characters are drawn perfectly and have a depth. You feel the
rationale of these gangsters and even find yourself siding with them. No
scene is wasted.<br /><br />This is easily a 10/10, and to some extent, makes me rethink some other
movies that I've rated a 9 or 10. Taking from Spinal Tap, this movie should
be an 11. It is on my top 5 list of favorite movies. I liked it more than
The Godfather (it's close, though). I've seen it a dozen times and it loses
nothing with each subsequent viewing. If anything, it gains more and more of
my admiration.
