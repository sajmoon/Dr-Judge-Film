The gangster film has been redefined so many times in cinema history it
will be interesting to see how it is redefined once again. Goodfellas
is a milestone film in that regard because just as Public Enemy and
Little Caesar defined it in the Thirties, The Godfather trilogy in the
seventies and eighties, Goodfellas set the standard that all other
films including Martin Scorsese similar Casino try to meet. The
interesting thing is that Martin Scorsese is young enough to redefine
it again with another work.<br /><br />With Ray Liotta narrating his own life in crime in a flashback as real
life criminal Henry Hill, Martin Scorsese offers us one fascinating
glimpse of the criminal life in the Eisenhower to Reagan era. Henry
Hill even as a child got sucked into the criminal life as a kid, as he
said all he ever wanted to be was a gangster. Tutored by both Robert
DeNiro and Paul Sorvino, Liotta takes part in one of the biggest heists
of all time of Lufthansa Airlines at JFK Airport during the seventies.
Goodfellas is the story of the events from Henry Hill&#39;s perspective
leading up to the heist and the aftermath.<br /><br />For myself I&#39;ve never seen the gangster mentality better expressed on
screen except maybe by Sean Connery in Family Business. Liotta and
Connery operate from the same mindset. If you work hard and hope it
pays off in success, you&#39;re a dope. If you want something, just take
it. When you come right down to it, that&#39;s how criminals think, it&#39;s
the rest of us who are fools.<br /><br />Goodfellas was nominated for several Oscars, but came away with only
one winner, Joe Pesci in the role of crazy Tommy DeVito. He&#39;s another
criminal type, one who&#39;s driven by a terrible inferiority complex due
to his short stature and does terrible things even to his own peers.
And those peers don&#39;t forget as you see what happens to Pesci in
Goodfellas. This turned out to be a career role for Pesci. He&#39;s a
multi-talented man who&#39;s got an incredible range and can play
everything from the Home Alone comedies to stone killers like here in
Goodfellas or in Casino.<br /><br />There&#39;s usually a contest in which Scorsese fans argue whether Casino
or Goodfellas is better. I happen to like Casino, but without the
success of Goodfellas, Casino would not have been made.<br /><br />For a fascinating look at the criminal mindset, Goodfellas is an
absolute must.
