Goodfellas is a great film about the underground world of organized
crime. There are great performances from Pesci ,
De Niro , and Bracco. The movie is based on a true story which makes it even
better. There is a great script and never a dull moment. The right kind of
music seems to sink in at just the right time. Brilliant film techniques
such as narration , freezing , and flashbacks. Definitely one of Scorsese's
best. Although he once again got passed up for best director. Joe Pesci gets
a well deserved Oscar for  best supporting actor.
