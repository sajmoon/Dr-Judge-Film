2004_September 6 

There are so many things that I can write about that you haven't already
heard. Such things like the best gangster film in the last decade or
Scorcese does it again with true story status. So many things can be
said about this film that if I said, the next guy adding a comment will
only repeat what the others have said. But I will say one thing though,
Scorcese has done it. He will keep on doing it. And nothing will stop
him. Unless there's a &quot;Goodfellas 2&quot; which I doubt. Well hope not. And
the one thing that I will always remember about Scorcese is the usage
of his mom. Especially in the borrowing of the knife scene, which was
great. Nice old lady, wonder what got her into the Mafia????<br /><br />---Cruizer07
