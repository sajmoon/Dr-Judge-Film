First of all Martin Scorsese is my favorite director. Second this is
his best film in a big way. How the Academy missed him for Oscar here
is a travesty. <br /><br />The film has an almost documentary feel to it early on. Love the intro
of Ray Liotta's character and how he was sucked into the life of a
gangster. The acting is top notch across the board (even the small
roles). <br /><br />The food, the violence, the dark humor - carry the front of the film.
Almost intoxicating the viewer to the glee of being a gang member till
it is too late. When things go bad you realize there is no escape for
Henry Hill from the life he chose. He will be killed or give it all up. <br /><br />From what I've read Henry Hill the man is hardly Henry Hill the
character in this film, but that doesn't mean much as few know the real
Henry Hill anyways. It isn't as though it was a biography of someone
truly famous or important in history. It is the story of a petty
criminal, turned drug addict, turned snitch that is done as well as any
film ever.
