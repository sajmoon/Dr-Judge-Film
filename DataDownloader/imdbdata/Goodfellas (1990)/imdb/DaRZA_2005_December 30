2005_December 30 
30 yrs in the history of a mafia-career of one man (and his wife).<br /><br />A bunch of stars in one movie about a so called mafia family. Does this
work ?<br /><br />Yes it does !<br /><br />It's very intense and shows between the lines the every day life of
being in the &quot;familia&quot; with all its (dis-)advantages. Especially if
things fall apart...<br /><br />The part I liked most is if the movie switches to female as the
narrator. The most intensive part is during the seventies when drugs
come into play.<br /><br />watch it and be stunned for hours.
