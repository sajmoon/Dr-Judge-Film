'Goodfellas' is a masterpiece, pure and simple. While not my favourite
Martin Scorsese movie it is a stunning achievement, and one of his very best
movies. The film is stunning technically. The consistently fine acting by
the large ensemble cast (both known and unknown), the cinematography,
editing, dialogue, brilliant use of music, it's all breathtaking. But
Scorsese and co-writer Mitch Pileggi never lose lose sight of their main
goal - to tell a story. And in that it's really hard to beat this movie. As
to the actors De Niro is on top form, Ray Liotta is the best he's ever been,
and this is Joe Pesci's definitive performance. Plus you have Lorraine
Bracco, Paul Sorvino, Michael Imperioli, and lots of well known faces in
small but important roles (Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, Illeana Douglas,
Kevin Corrigan), plus dozens of unfamiliar actors (and non-actors) who are
all so good it seems unfair just to single out the &quot;stars&quot;. (Also keep an
eye out for Vincent Gallo in a few scenes. He has no lines, but looks
cool!). 'Goodfellas' is (to date) Scorsese's last Great Movie, and one of
the very best films of the 1990s. Absolutely essential viewing for any movie
fan, this tremendous film is not to be missed! Highly recommended!
