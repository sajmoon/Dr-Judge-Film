One of my favorite movies, ever.  <br /><br />The plot is fascinating, each of the scenes is extremely powerful, Scorsese
did a phemonenal job directing, and the acting is amazing.  Joe Pesci's
character is one of the scariest characters I've ever seen on film or TV.
Robert DeNiro is, as usual, terrific, and Ray Liotta plays his part
perfectly.  <br /><br />The movie is over 2 hours long, but it goes by so quickly that you want to
watch it all over again after it's over.<br /><br />The most chilling scene in the movie is the &quot;Layla&quot; scene...I've never felt
that way about a scene in a movie before.  <br /><br />
