Undoubtedly, Goodfella's is an exceptional film that portrays life in a
notorious gang, with no holds barred.  The cast is simply electric, as Ray
Liotta delivers a wonderfully colourful and emotional performance as the
boy
striving to be a someone in a land of 'losers'.  The film focuses on
Liotta's ambition to be part of something extraordinary, something that
will
give him an identity above anyone else.  Robert de Niro eventually becomes
an overseer of Liotta's and together with Joe Pesci, who's depiction of
Tommy Devito - a brutal gang member who always acts before he thinks -
become embroiled in heists of an undercover nature.  The pace of the movie
is exquisite, as issues of ambition and loyalty ensure Liotta's (Henry
Hill)
excitement of the way the other half live is kept to optimum.  Love is
also
on the horizon, but a Mobsters world is never a straight die as drugs
cloud
judgement and errors test friendships.  Simply fantastic.
