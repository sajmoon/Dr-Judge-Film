&#39;GoodFellas&#39; is an interesting piece. It has the mobster-romance of
Godfather and the gritty reality of Scarface all in one. Yet, it is
perhaps less than the sum of all its parts. Mob-films aren&#39;t typically
cheery or uplifting but keeping a safe-zone where the audience isn&#39;t
too bothered by all the evil things going on screen is something I
really missed and something which I think The Godfather succeeded much
better in accomplishing.<br /><br />On its own the film is none the less fantastic. It feels like a twisted
kind of reality where you&#39;re not exactly sure what&#39;s real and what&#39;s
not. Perhaps I get a little squeamish when drugs become an element in
the story but that might be just me. There is a great deal of irony in
the film but it lacks the likability of The Godfather. <br /><br />On the whole that might not be a fair comparison as Coppola&#39;s films
made up a saga where as this had to wrap the mobster tale in one movie.
It&#39;s definitely a great film for fans of mobster films, but not a
master-piece and way too gory and bleak. On the whole I thought the
performances were, none-the-less, great. Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta and
Joe Pesci are amongst my favorite actors and each deliver a brilliant
character to the screen.
