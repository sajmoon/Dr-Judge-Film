I hate it when people ask me what my favorite movie of all time is.  That
is
like asking an art lover what their favorite painting is.  Break it down
to
favorite abstract painter, favorite contemporary artist, and you might get
a
more definitive answer.  So asking a movie buff what their favorite film
is
not entirely fair.  I have a favorite comedy, a favorite drama, horror,
foreign film etc., but to pick one from the bunch is more question than I
can handle.<br /><br />Given my above conundrum, if I was ever to amass a list of best-evers,
1990's Goodfellas would surely be near the top of the list.  Directed by
Martin Scorsese and featuring an all-star cast including Robert DeNiro,
Joe
Pesci and Ray Liotta, Goodfellas was nominated for six Academy Awards
including Best Picture.  Although at the end of the March ceremony, only
one
award was engraved with a participant's name - Pesci for Supporting
Actor -
Goodfellas remains as maybe the best film of the 1990's.<br /><br />Based on the novel 'Wiseguy', by Nicholas Pileggi, the movie follows the
true story of Henry Hill (Liotta), as he rises through the ranks of the
mob.
From child to young adult, we watch Henry as he gains acceptance, gets
married, and goes to jail, starts dealing drugs, all leading to his
capture
by authorities.<br /><br />Along for the wild ride of mob hits, heists and murders are Jimmy and
Tommy
(DeNiro and Pesci, respectively), two lifetime mobsters that take Henry
under their wings and teach him the ropes.  Jimmy is the elder statesman
who
handles things professionally and is respected for his calm demeanor.
Tommy
is the hot-head stereotype who resorts to violence whenever threatened.
Together, they provide the perfect balance for Henry as he tries to cope
with life in the underworld while maintaining a normal life
presence.<br /><br />Goodfellas is a near perfect film.  Scorsese has cast each part with
actors
born to play their role.  From Paul Sorvino as the mob figurehead to
Lorraine Bracco in a breakthrough performance as Henry's love interest,
the
cast fits together like a leather glove.  And they each have cool names to
boot.  There is Spider, Fat Andy, Pete the Killer and Jimmy Two Times just
to ramble off a few.  Whether you were a bit player or someone with a
bigger
trailer, Scorsese handles everyone with crafted dialogue and incredible
attention to authenticity.<br /><br />What also makes Goodfellas so good, are the costumes and set design that
bring us right back to the 70's and 80's tacky kitchens and pastel living
room furniture.  Scorsese does well in bringing us through multiple
decades
and showing the natural progression of the actors and their belongings as
time marches forward.<br /><br />Even the voice over works.  Not a fan of this cheap tactic to move a story
forward, Henry Hill bursts narration throughout the film with quotes like,
`Jimmy was the kinda guy that rooted for bad guys in the movies' and
`Whenever we needed money, we'd rob the airport. To us, it was better than
Citibank.'  Each narration brings either humor or does well in helping us
grow with the characters and eventually cheering for violence bearing
mafia.<br /><br />But if I could pick one thing to give the director his chops, it would
have
to be in his depiction of Henry Hill.  By taking his time with the story
(the movie does run 145 minutes), we can follow Henry through the many
stages of his involvement.  When Henry is involved with his first
encounter
with violence, it is a believable occurrence based on the progression.
And
when Henry begins selling drugs, we may not agree, but we can definitely
understand what brought him and his family to that stage of their
lives.<br /><br />The DVD comes without many special features, and that is too bad.  It
would
be interesting to hear Scorsese talk about how some cast members (Michael
Imperioli and Tony Sirico) went on to become famous with the Soprano's, or
how he was able to nab Samuel L. Jackson and Vincent Gallo for parts all
but
forgotten by the audience before the end credits.<br /><br />Five stars are not to be taken or given lightly.  Goodfellas deserves
every
one of them.<br /><br />
