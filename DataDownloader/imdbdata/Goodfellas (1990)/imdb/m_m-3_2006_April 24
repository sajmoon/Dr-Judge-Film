before that I watch it I thought it is a masterpiece, but when I
watched it I I understood that is not. it has a repetition story
because The Godfather &amp; Scarface told about corruption of power before.
I gave it 6 stars because directing and performances are fantastic but
the story....???!!!! runtime is 145 minutes but it seems 245
minutes.Scarface &amp; The Godfather are about 170 minutes but they seem
120 minutes.that is for repetition story again. I forgot to say Joe
Pesci was fantastic. I hope that fans of Goodfellas excuse me for this
comment,<br /><br />this is mine
