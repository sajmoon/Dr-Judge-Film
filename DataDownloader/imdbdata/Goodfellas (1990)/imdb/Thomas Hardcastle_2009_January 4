I absolutely adore this film. It&#39;s clever, shocking, funny, violent,
educational and entertaining.<br /><br />The entire cast play their parts brilliantly, from the spine-tingling
Tommy, to the smooth, under-control Jimmy.<br /><br />The film catches the zeitgeist in an exceptional manner, and shows both
sides of the coin when you&#39;re a gangster - the perks and the ugly side.<br /><br />Scorcese&#39;s use of comedy, mixed with horrific moments brings the film
into a different light, as it is not just about being dangerous and
deadly, but there are also humorous elements added to the mix as well.<br /><br />Overall, the film shows that loyalty has its benefits, but in the end,
the friend who screws the other over first will be the one that gets
away with everything.
