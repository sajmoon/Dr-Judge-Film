I would have to say this is the greatest gangster film of all time. I
love the godfather 1 and 2 and most other top mafia films such as
casino, scarface, once upon. just my opinion but this has got to be up
there with most film fans favourites. To have three stars like Liotta,
Pesci and de niro produce their best work, (first two mainly} just
shows the caliber of the film. If you look at the other contenders,
Brando was the star in a great film, Pacino was, also as montana, but
they carried those two films in my opinion. I may be biased as i think
de niro is the greatest actor of all time but there you go. Let me know
what you think and any other films that i may not have seen.
