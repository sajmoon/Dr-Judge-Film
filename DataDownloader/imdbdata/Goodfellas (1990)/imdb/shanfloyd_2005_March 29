This is one hell of a film about the mobsters, based on a true story
and coming from one of the great directors of all time. This is about
Henry Hill, the narrator of the story, an Irish simple person who gets
involved with the Mafia at a very young age and continues his life
through it. There is no major plot in this film, just isolated
incidents one of which was the turning point of Hill's life. Scorsese,
as brilliant as he ever was, shows violence, sex and drugs etc in his
own trademark style. And his actors helps him to make this film one of
the classics.<br /><br />Robert DeNiro is not present in much of the film, nor his acting leaves
too much impression. The three actors who really did their best job
here are Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracco. I hate to say that
most youngsters today don't know too much about Liotta or how talented
he was. I asked my younger brother about him and he said, &quot;The man who
did the voice on GTA: Vice City?&quot;. This is partly because Liotta did
not get too many big roles after that, especially in recent years. But
here he is just brilliant as Hill. It's Pesci's one of the best too.
Playing a mad mobster with dark sense of humor wasn't his usual type.
And Lorraine Bracco becomes the perfect lead female in such type of
films.<br /><br />The film's got smart screenplay and excellent cinematography. And I
don't know how many times Scorsese will be denied his Academy
recognition. I hate to see a lifetime achievement award as his first
Oscar. But things are going like that.
