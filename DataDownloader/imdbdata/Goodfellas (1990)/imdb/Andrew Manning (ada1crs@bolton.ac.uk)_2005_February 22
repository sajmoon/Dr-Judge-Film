'Goodfellas', alongside 'Pulp Fiction' stands as my all time favorite
film. Based on Nicolas Pillegi's outstanding novel the screenplay is
intelligent and thrilling and gives credence to each performer. In
crime movies the female leads (if any) are whiny and one dimensional
but Lorraine Bracco's Oscar nominated perfromance is brilliant and her
character is as dimensional as Henry (a slightly disappointing Ray
Liotta, he rushes the voice-over and much of his dialogue). Jimmy
(forget Raging Bull, this is DeNiro's greatest performance)Conway is
pure genius and Pesci is great as the plain insane Tommy DeVito.<br /><br />Scorcese directs with a fast moving and in your face visual style and
punctuates the soundtrack with some of the best rock/pop songs of the
sixties and seventies, ending with Sid Viscous's 'My Way' was a stroke
of genius and putting 'Down Below the Ocean' over the Batt's murder was
insane but it worked because it goes against the grain.<br /><br />People say the Godfather is the greatest crime movie ever and perhaps
they are right. But I have to disagree, 'Goodfellas' is more energetic
more exciting and most importantly more FUN than the dreary, boring
Godfather's.<br /><br />A flat out, awe inspiring, no-one will ever make a film as good as this
again MASTERPIECE.<br /><br />10/10
