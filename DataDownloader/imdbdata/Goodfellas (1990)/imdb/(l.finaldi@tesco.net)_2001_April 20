Scorsese's film Goodfellas is a hard one to catalogue. It is an absolute
cinematic masterpiece, see the excellent tracking shots (entering the copa
by the back way) and also the tense, and sweaty final scene. I have no
complaints with the impeccable acting from Liotta, De Niro, and Lorraine
Bracco. Joe Pesci seems to exaggerate in his portrayal of Tommy (a role which
he practically copies in Casino)but I think he deserved the oscar
nomination.I also have no qualms with soundtrack which is one of the finest
collections of songs around, neither the scenes which although follow short
narratives have an electricity about them that makes them interesting. I'm
not sure about one thing or whether anyone else shares my views, but is it
fun to watch something like this? These people are the lowest, slimiest,
lowlifes on Earth! A question which often came to me during the film's
excellent scenes was whether one feels sympathy for the characters? Not
really. All of them are backstabbers and unlike other scorsese films there
is no real redemption. Hill gets what he deserves. Pesci also gets what he
deserves and de Niro's character is truly detestable as he tries even to
kill Henry's wife. This is a question which has often crossed my mind
whether it is important to feel sympathy for a character, or is it simply
enough to feel any sort of emotion be it sympathy or utter dislike. In
Raging Bull I'm certain that some of us watching were frightened by De
Niro's portrayal of LaMotta as the evil in him was sometimes far to close to
evil we have sometimes felt ourselves, it finishes, though with his
redemption. Also the characters in Mean Streets, Scorsese's best film, are
likeable even down to Johnny Boy who being a nut is still funny and played
with pathos by the ever present De Niro. So what happened in Goodfellas? I'm
not sure Scorsese would want us to love the film, appreciate it yes, but
love it and praise it I don't know. It is a great character study, but, of
lowlifes, people we really wouldn't want to meet.
