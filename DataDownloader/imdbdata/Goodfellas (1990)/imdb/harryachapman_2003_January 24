The greatest gangster film ever without a doubt. Martin Scorsese knows how
to put together a truly great film with a truly great cast which he
certainly does here. Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta are excellent in their
roles, but the real star of the show has to be Joe Pesci. His Oscar was 100%
justified after he plays the role of his life as the violent mobster. If you
haven't seen this masterpiece see it quickly. It's a truly outstanding film
done by a truly outstanding director.
