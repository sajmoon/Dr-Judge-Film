1999_March 4 

Truly an absorbing piece of filmmaking. Scorsese has sculpted a fine
piece of art here. Every scene is exuberating. Every line is sharp. Every
performance astounds. Pesci is especially perfect as the sarcastic, but
psychotic mob henchmen, who pulls Liotta's leg in one of the most
wonderfully acted scenes ever. While DeNiro is wonderful, the film truly
belongs to Liotta who amazes and enthralls with each scene. A classic is all
areas. Up and coming directors should study this film if they want to see
greatness...
