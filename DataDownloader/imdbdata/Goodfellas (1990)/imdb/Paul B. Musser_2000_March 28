	Previously Viewed	Non Anamorphic Widescreen<br /><br />This is a great movie, and not just a great mob movie.  The story is quick
and smart, and the all star cast does a great job with it.  Scorsese uses a
grainy film stock (intentionally I'm sure) bothers me.  Whatever his
reasons, for me it distracts from the experience.  Additionally, the video
transfer is not anamorphic: a double disappointment.  The DVD includes few
real extras.
