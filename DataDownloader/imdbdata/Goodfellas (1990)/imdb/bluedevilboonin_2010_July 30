Not only is this the best mob movie ever made. It is the best movie
ever made. Everything about it is perfect from the acting to the
fantastic soundtrack and the great directing from the legendary Martin
Scorsese. If you have not seen this yet make sure you see it soon you
wont be disappointed. Joe Pesci is fantastic in his Oscar winning role
as Tommy Devito. But the best acting in the movie was done by then
newcomer Ray Liotta. His narration and the way he delivers his lines is
great. This movie was nominated for best picture but was beat by Dances
with Wolves which was great but did not deserve the Oscar. This movie
is a classic and should be a required viewing for any gangster movie
fan. Make sure you see this outstanding classic of a mob movie. A
masterpiece.
