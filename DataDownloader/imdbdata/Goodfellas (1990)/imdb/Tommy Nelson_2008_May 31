&quot;Goodfellas&quot; is an exceptional mobster film, but not because of it&#39;s
plot or script. It&#39;s a good plot, nothing too exceptional however, and
the characters are pretty solid throughout, every one being a complete
sleaze-ball. The performances are amazing. Ray Liotta is the main
character and actually shows off his acting abilities best through his
super slick narration throughout the film. Joe Pesci gives an
outstanding supporting performance as the tough, wiseguy he plays in
most movies, but for some reason it stands out here. Robert Deniro also
gives an amazing(ly tough) and powerful performance. It&#39;s all about the
cool direction and great acting for this film.<br /><br />Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) has always wanted to be a gangster ever since
he was a young boy. We learn his background and how he gets caught up
with the mobsters, from the good times to the bad. Two of his closest
friends are Jimmy (Robert Deniro) and Tommy (Joe Pesci). Tommy
(especially) goes crazy with power and eventually these three are
working their way to the top of the mob standings.<br /><br />One problem with this movie is the lack of any soul or redeeming
characters. The characters we are presented are interesting to listen
to and follow, but we know each one is a violent criminal. Even movies
like &quot;The Godfather&quot; or &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; give us characters that if not
redeeming, become somewhat redeeming by the end of the film and make us
care about them. For all I cared, they could&#39;ve massacred the entire
cast of characters. I&#39;d still have had a heck of a time watching them,
as I did, they just weren&#39;t likable. Luckily, the most likable
character is also the narrator and star of the film, Ray Liotta.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great mobster film, with some outstanding
performances and snappy direction. However, the lack of any redeeming
characters might annoy viewers who need at least one person to root
for, though those people may find themselves rooting for the three main
guys to murder to whole lot of them just for the entertainment value.<br /><br />My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 145 mins. R for violence, drug use,
sexuality, language.
