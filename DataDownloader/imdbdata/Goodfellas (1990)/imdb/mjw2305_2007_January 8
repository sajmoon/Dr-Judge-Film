Scorcese&#39;s masterpiece, that&#39;s probably the best way to describe it; he
takes us on a journey through Henry Hill&#39;s (Ray Liotta&#39;s) life, from
boy to man, as he climbs through the ranks of the mobster scene, and
Ray Liotta gives the performance of his life. Supported by great
characters portrayed perfectly by Robert De Niro, Lorraine Bracco and
the star of the piece Joe Pesci; this movie simply overflows with
style, talent and guts.<br /><br />It&#39;s incredibly violent and it&#39;s brimming with vulgar language, but
every bit of it is warranted as a piece of the picture. Now i am the
first to admit that i am not a big fan of gangster movies, but i cannot
fail to appreciate the magnificence of this excellent film.<br /><br />It&#39;s better than Casino (7/10) and it makes the godfather (6/10) look
tame by comparison.<br /><br />Goodfellas (9/10) and its genuinely worth it
