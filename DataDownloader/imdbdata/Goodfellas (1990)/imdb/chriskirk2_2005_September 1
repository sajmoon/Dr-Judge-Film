Third on the &quot;best gangster film&quot; list; right behind the first two
GODFATHERS- This grand story follows the lives of a group of tough
hoods through four fascinating decades. Scorsese is the world's current
greatest living filmmaker; and he really hit an amazing peak here. The
direction, cast, editing, script and period detail are all flawless.
Unlike the GODFATHER, these hoods are petty, wild and occasionally
insane. These are working guys, living it up and &quot;earning&quot; at all
costs. Scorsese changes gears according to the times: The laid-back,
high living' 50's and 60's; the crazy, coked-out 70's; as well as the
crash-and-burn 80's; Scorsese show the flash, the power, and the
degradation of these amazing guys. This is an great American work of
art from front to back.
