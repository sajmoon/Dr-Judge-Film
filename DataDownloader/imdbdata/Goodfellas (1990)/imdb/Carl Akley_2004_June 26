If you love gangster flick you will love this amazing film about a half
Irish, half Italian mobster, and his life in the mafia. Scorsese's
story telling is beautiful, and poetic, as towering performances from
Robert Deniro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Loitta take center stage. Critics,
and movie goers alike rave Goodfellas as one of the best ever made.
Scorsese never lets you down, and every movie he makes will change your
look on movies, and life. When Scorsese makes a new film, you tend to
look forward to it, and Goodfellas is no exception. You will set down,
and enjoy it's great acting, and juicy storyline to the very end. What
an unforgettable work of art this is!
