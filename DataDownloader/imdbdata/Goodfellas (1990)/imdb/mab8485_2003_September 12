Brilliant gangster movie that shows the rise (and subsequent fall)of young
lads (Liotta, DeNiro and Pesci)up the crime ladder.
The scenes with Liotta are particularly effective as is the general
narrative. I liked the portrayal of Liotta's move into drug dealing and his
and his wife's later descent into cocaine addiction. The frenzied moments
when the police helicopter is tailing Liotta accompanied by the background
playing of Harry Nilsson's &quot;Into The Fire&quot; captures the scene perfectly. An
excellent gangster movie that has it all - on a par with the
Godfather.
