Goodfellas without a doubt is an outstanding mafia flick.
Maybe
the best ever! It's a shame it didn't get the Oscar for best<br /><br />picture, thanks in large part to Dances With Wolves. 
This movie definetly had a great storyline as well as superb acting.
Who
could ever forget Pesci's performance, along with screen
legend
Robert DeNiro. It's too bad Ray Liotta didn't a nomination for
his
portrayal of real life gangster Henry Hill. That was probably
his
finest performance. Martin Scorsese may be the best director
to
never win an Oscar. Goodfellas will always be a classic, just as<br /><br />The Godfather will always be.
