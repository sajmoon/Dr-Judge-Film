Goodfellas is one of the best mafia movies ever made! Ray Liotta
deserved an Oscar for his performance of Henry Hill! Every scene that
he's in is completely believable! Ray is an amazing actor and a great
narrator too! The other cast members are great too! Robert DeNiro, Joe
Pesci, Paul Sorvino and Lorraine Bracco are great too! I also liked the
music in this movie too! I would definitely recommend this movie to my
friends and family! It is an exciting and entertaining movie! On a
scale of one to ten with ten being excellent I'd give it a ten!
Lorraine Bracco gives a very sassy and gutsy performance in her
portrayal of Karen Hill
