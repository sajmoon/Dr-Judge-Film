Martin Scorsese is without question a genius. This and 'Casino' are quite
simply the greatest ever mafia movies ever made. Robert De Niro and Ray
Liotta put in great shows but the star of this one is the magnificent Joe
Pesci who won a 100% deserved Oscar for his role in this movie. His
portrayal as violent mobster Tommy is graphic, deeply realistic and very
scary. The Scorsese and De Niro is one of the finest ever. This and 'Casino'
are the 2 greatest without doubt. Both are gripping, scary, realistic and
moving. To anyone who hasn't seen either you simply don't know what you're
missing. Two outstanding masterpieces with an outstanding cast in both. Both
are absolute must sees.
