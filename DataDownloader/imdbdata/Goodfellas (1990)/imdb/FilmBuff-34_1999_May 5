&quot;Goodfellas&quot; is possibly the best movie ever created in the history of
film.
It gives an exact account of life in the mob, how it works, what to do
with
the rats. It truly is a hallmark of our times, with the workings of Bobby
DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Ray Liota, this is a treasure. &quot;Goodfellas&quot; has the
best
song for the credits, and when Tommy gets made they play the piano exit to
Layla by Clapton, the greatest song of all time. All I can say is that
this
movie should be in everyone's library of videos.
