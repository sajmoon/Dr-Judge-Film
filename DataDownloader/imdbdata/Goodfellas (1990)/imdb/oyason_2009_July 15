GOODFELLAS is a vignette heavy narrative of what life is allegedly like
in the working class end of the mob. The work as a whole contains
powerful imagery from the life of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), the man who
wanted to be a gangster as far back as he could remember. It contains
some chilling characterizations from Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci, as
well as a warm representation of an older hood, handled masterfully by
Paul Sorvino. Lorraine Bracco has the trying task of playing Henry&#x27;s
stressed spouse, who is but hopelessly addicted to the moneyed gangster
lifestyle despite all the pain that goes with it.<br /><br />The storyline is basically: an East Brooklyn kid grows up in the mob,
meets many bad guys, is &#x22;hooked up&#x22;, gets somewhat rich, participates
callously in a few mob brutalities, is betrayed and betrays and
basically learns his lesson. Sort of. GOODFELLAS is a significant
gangster film, meaning that you can&#x27;t explore the genre worth a damn
without taking it into account, but it&#x27;s not great. As to its
&#x22;realistic&#x22; portrayal of the mob, well, I&#x27;ve never been there, so I
don&#x27;t know.<br /><br />Martin Scorcese has done better work, THE LAST WALTZ is probably one of
the best rock concert documentaries ever made. I don&#x27;t think his
narrative style is worth much in GOODFELLAS. For me, the whole thing
sort of falls flat, like the experience of viewing a condominium Henry
Hill was selling when he was leaving Seattle a few years ago. I didn&#x27;t
know who he was, he didn&#x27;t know who I was. I&#x27;ve seen GOODFELLAS several
times, and I still have no sense of who Henry Hill was. Maybe that&#x27;s
the problem I have with this film.
