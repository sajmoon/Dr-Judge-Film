Goodfellas was a fast moving, good mobster movie. Scorsese's best movie, it
shows behind the lives of mobsters. Joe Pesci had some good lines. Probably
his best movie. I think this was by far Ray Liotta's best movie. Robert De
Niro did a great job, but I don't think it was his best. The movie was
graphic at times. This movie is excellent. **** out of ****
stars.
