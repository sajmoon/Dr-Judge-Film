  Tough and uncompromising with its rather hilarious moments, &quot;Goodfellas&quot;
is one of the best Mafia movies ever.  It's the story of Henry Hill, from
the day he decided he wanted to be a gangster until the day he joined the
Witness Protection Program. <br /><br />  All along the movie, he sticks with crazy Tommy De Vito (Pesci) and
living-mob-legend, Jimmy Conway (De Niro) as they work for Paulie (Paul
Sorvino).  All goes well for Henry until he starts cheating on his wife and
then gets sent to jail.  The scenes in the jail where you see where wiseguys
live apart from the rest of the prisoners are excellent (especially when
Henry describes diner in jail).<br /><br />  As good as Liotta, Bracco , De Niro, and Sorvino are though, it's Joe
Pesci who rules this movie.  His incarnation of the crazy, cowboy-like,
short-tempered Tommy De Vito, he is excellent and it's understandable that
he won the Oscar for best supporting-actor (he also supplies a lot of the
laughs).  Don't miss this one.  It's definitely one of Scorsese's
best.
