This movie was an instant classic to me. From the second I pressed
Play, I knew it was going to be great. And it was. A lot of people bash
this movie for being a knockoff of &quot;The Godfather&quot;, but it is in no way
a knockoff. This movie is based off a true story first off. Also,
there&#39;s no &quot;mafia&quot; or &quot;families&quot; really to speak of. And a majority of
the characters are Irish, not Italian. I liked all the different
characters involved, the wiseguys, the losers, the brutes, the smart
AND dumb people, you name it. The fighting/shooting/heist scenes were
perfectly executed (no pun intended). Ray Liotta is great as Henry
Hill, he explains everything so well and makes &quot;the life&quot; look great.
Robert DeNiro really proved himself once again in the part of Jimmy
Conway. And Joe Pesci was perfect to play Tommy DeVito. All the
supporting/side characters were great as well. I give this a 10/10,
which I don&#39;t do very often but this movie deserves it.
