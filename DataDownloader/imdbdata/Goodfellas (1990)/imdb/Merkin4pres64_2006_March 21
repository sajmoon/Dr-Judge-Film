I have never been a die-hard fan of Martin Scorsese, but &quot;Goodfellas&quot;
astounded me. It avoids the generic form of a gangster film by diving
into areas where previous mafia films haven't. From drug dealing and
the Witness Protection Program, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; separates itself from the
generic template of a gangster film.<br /><br />GoodFellas starts off with a flashback by giving the background of
Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and how he became associated with the mafia as
a teenager. In this flashback, we become learned of his connections and
ties all over the place that will eventually help later on in the
movie. While many flashbacks in different films are unneeded, this one
isn't vital to the story, it connects things together, but it's also
fun to watch.<br /><br />When we reach the 1960's, we meet Karen (Lorraine Bracco), the future
wife of Hill it becomes an even better ride. Karen isn't seen much in
the first thirty five minutes of the film, but once the camera pans on
her, it's a pity when it isn't. Bracco's Karen is the strongest
performance in the film which could have easily won her an Oscar.
Without Karen, there would be no &quot;Goodfellas.&quot; She is the backbone of
this movie, and without a doubt, makes this movie what it is today.<br /><br />As established in the flashback, we see how Henry becomes associated
with Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) and
their ring of crime. While there are not enough words to even begin to
describe the accomplishments of the trio, from Henry's drug business to
Tommy and Jimmy's heist and hits, these scenes are a joy to watch with
no place to become boards.<br /><br />With excellent direction by Martin Scorcese, we see the director's
nostalgic side of film-making as &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is basically a two and
half hour long homage to the 1950's and 1960's music and culture. We
see the characters become engrossed in the pop culture of the era up
until the eighties when Jimmy is incarcerated after Henry becomes a rat
for the police to avoid jail time.<br /><br />There is no boring scene in this masterpiece. Everything is crystal
clear and the script is quick, witty, and profane. This movie is highly
recomendable and is a movie for those who love gangster films and for
those who love cinema in general.
