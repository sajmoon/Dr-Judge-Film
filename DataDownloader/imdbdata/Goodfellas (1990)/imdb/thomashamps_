This is the gangster film at its finest. Scorsese is on top form as are
Pesci and De Niro. Liotta has never bettered the performance he gives
here.
The film starts as it means to go on - violent, full of profanity, fast
paced and very stylish. The story follows Liotta's character from boy to
man
as he climbs his way up through the ranks of organised crime. We see all
the
highs and lows of his life and meet a host of very believable and very
undesirable characters along the way. It's a film full of memorable scenes
whilst remaining much more than the sum of its individual parts at the same
time.
This is what all movies should be like. It draws you in and won't let you
out of its grasp at any point. When it finishes you feel exhausted and
exhilarated at the same time. If ever the word 'masterpiece' was meant to
be
used, it was for this film.
