1999_August 6 

i just wanted to add that it's disturbing how all the people like the
movie
for its &quot;realism&quot;, &quot;real-life story&quot;, etc. at its heart, this movie is a
triumph of the art of cinema with its fluidity, imagination and
professionalism. you could really sense scorsese standing next to you when
you watch &quot;goodfellas&quot;.<br /><br />but is it better than &quot;the godfather&quot;? almost certainly.
