This film is without a doubt the best DeNiro/Scorsese collabaration.  In
fact, the only other Scorsese film that comes close to it is Taxi Driver.
The story is all about Henry Hill's (Ray Liotta) life as a gangster in New
York.  Robert Deniro, Paul Sorvino and Lorraine Bracco all have wonderful
supporting roles, as does Joe Pesci, whose excellent performance as the
psychotic Tommy DeVito won him a well deserved oscar.
There's no prizes for guessing that DeNiro does his job well, as does The
talented Sorvino.  But it may come as a shock that Ray Liotta also plays
his
part very well, as does Lorraine Bracco.  There is also a small role for a
pre Pulp Fiction Samuel L. Jackson, and one of my favourite character
actors, Beau Starr (Halloween 4 and 5, Speed) also pops up in a role as
Henry's father.<br /><br />Scorsese's direction, as always, is flawless, with interesting camera
shots,
and a celebrated steadycam shot through the bowels of a night club.  The
music used is perfect for the film, with hits from the 50's right up to
the
80's.<br /><br />The violence in the film is graphic and frequent, however, it all adds to
the film, and is intended to make you scared and possibly discusted and
horrified.  You will walk away from this film with possibly the same sort
of
feeling you had when you'd just seen A Clockwork Orange, or Reservoir
Dogs.
But be aware of this;  the most talked about scene in A Clockwork Orange
is
the 'Singing In The Rain rape scene' in Reservoir Dogs, it's the 'ear
slicing scene'.  In Goodfellas it's the '&quot;How am I funny?&quot; scene'.  That
shows to me that the acting in Goodfellas is so good, that it far
outweighs
the violence and death, even though, realistically, that is was the film's
about.<br /><br />This is a film that everyone with even the slightest interest in film
should
see, if you only ever see one Scorsese film, make it this.  10 out of
10.
