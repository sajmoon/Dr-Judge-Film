This is one of those movies that you can give as a good example anytime
you want to mention movie-making brilliance to anyone.<br /><br />&quot;Goodfellas&quot; is a true gangster classic; a complete picture of the
mafia and its operations. Comparisons to &quot;The Godfather&quot; movies are
inevitable, but I shall say only this: both are great classics in their
respective places and deal with separate stories; &quot;The Godfather&quot;
movies are a riveting look at the goings-on in the life of the Corleone
Crime family, while &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is a portrayal of the life of the
mobsters who actually do all the jobs that some head of a crime family
might want done! Also, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; has more of a &quot;jolly&quot; mood
throughout the movie; you find yourself experiencing a feeling of
triumph every time they pull off a job! &quot;The Godfather&quot; movies on the
other hand have more of a somber atmosphere, enhanced by their sepia
overtones, and topped off with a very serious and grave approach to
story-telling.<br /><br />&quot;Goodfellas&quot; is based on the true story of a young man named Henry Hill
(Ray Liotta) who grows up to be a gangster in the company of other
gangsters he has always admired! These include Jimmy (Robert De Niro),
Tommy (Joe Pesci) and Paulie (Paul Sorvino).<br /><br />The movie takes an inside look at the operations carried out by the New
York Mob. It also shows how Henry along with his partners Jimmy and
Tommy, carries out a number of heists.<br /><br />All throughout the movie, these gangsters seem to be having complete
fun, with things going their way all the time! It&#39;s only towards the
end that things start to fall apart....<br /><br />There are some terrific scenes which have already gone down as classics
and only get better with repeated viewings; there&#39;s some very witty and
fantastic dialog (most of which is hogged by the brilliant Joe Pesci).<br /><br />Acting: Ray Liotta is great in the lead; but the best performances are
by Robert De Niro (even though he has less screen presence), Joe Pesci
(awesome, the way he mouths off the sharp dialog) and Paul Sorvino.
Lorraine Bracco is superb as Henry&#39;s wife, Karen.<br /><br />Wonderfully directed, brilliantly acted, this thoroughly entertaining
movie is a must-see! One of Martin Scorsese&#39;s best, along with &quot;Raging
Bull&quot;.
