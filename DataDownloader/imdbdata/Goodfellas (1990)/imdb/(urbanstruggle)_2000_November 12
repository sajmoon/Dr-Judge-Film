I do not think there is much I have to add to the film that other IMDB users
have not already highlighted, but I will say that the Oscar Joe Pesci got
for this film is one of the most deserved and completely justified Oscar's
of the last 20 years (and definitely the last decade in a time when there
have been many undeserving ones being handed out).  Joe Pesci is hilarious
and amazing in his performance as a lifelong gangster with two deadly &amp;
volatile traits:  A short temper and a chip on his shoulder.  While all of
the performances in this movie are very strong, Pesci was clearly in his
element here.  <br /><br />It's a shame that Martin Scorsese was once again cheated out of the Best
Director Oscar he so rightfully deserves in favor of Kevin Costner's
directing of &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; in 1990.  This movie would have never been
even close to the film it was had it been without Scorsese's amazing
filmmaking skill behind it.  The Academy better be ready to hand Marty one
hell of a lifetime achievement award one of these days because after close
to 30 years of being one of the greatest directors of his time, he has yet
to be rewarded with an Oscar.  The fact that &quot;Raging Bull&quot; was ripped off
for a Best Picture Oscar in 1980 was bad enough, not giving Marty the Oscar
he deserves after all these years, especially in lieu of making two films in
the last decade that he clearly deserved to win for (Casino being the other
one) is just salt in the wound at this point.  I give this film a 10/10,
it's one of the best story telling movies ever made and it gave insight into
the code of the mob better than any film had done before it (The Godfather
included) and has done since.
