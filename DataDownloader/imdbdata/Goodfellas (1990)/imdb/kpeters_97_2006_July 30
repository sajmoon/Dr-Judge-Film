although the godfather trilogy has been more critically acclaimed (at
least the first two films in the trilogy) goodfellas showed a humorous
side that made its non-stop, hard edged portrayal of mafia life and the
violence that accompanies that life even more engrossing as the film
plays out and the main character shows us how what was once a glamorous
lifestyle became his downfall. in addition it does an excellent job of
portraying how its easy allure traps not only Henry (Ray Liotta)but
Karen (Lorraine Bracco)and how when someone is no longer an asset to
the family, just how disposible they are. the film also introduced the
mass film audience to two talented people in Ray Liotta and the
beautiful Lorraine Brocco. Its also a crime that Martin Scorcaise did
not win an acadamy award as best director.
