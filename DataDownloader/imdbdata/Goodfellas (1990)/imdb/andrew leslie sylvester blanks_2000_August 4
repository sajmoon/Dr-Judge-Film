2000_August 4 

where do i start, scorsese was in a bit of a dark period at the time after
the undeserved failures of raging bull, king of comedy, after hours and
the
last temptation of christ, adapting from the true story of henry hill with
the co writer of the book, nicholas phleggi. scorsese fashioned something
incredibly brilliant out of it, with stunning, almost claustrophobic
photography by michael ballhus, perfect paced editing from michael
powell's
widow ( he died the same year the film came out) thelma schoonmaker and an
truly exhilarating mix of pithy, sharp, realistic dialogue, careful,
amazingly spot on pacing and of course perhaps the finest example of
direction ever to appear on screen all combine with jaw dropping
peformances
(especially from pesci who's &quot; you think i'm funny speech &quot; has to the
most
menacing speech of all time )to be the finest film ever
made.
