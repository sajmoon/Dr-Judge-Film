A movie must include everything to be an exelent movie, love, suspense,
hate,
sadness, friendship, laughs and much much more, what can i say.....this
movie is so good that you&acute;ll be shock, and you want to see it over and over
again, you can&acute;t belive &iacute;t&acute;s true...it&acute;s just too much
&iacute;t&acute;s a life work presented in 2,5 hours........and what a
life....
i want to marie goodfellas.......this is the best film ever made
