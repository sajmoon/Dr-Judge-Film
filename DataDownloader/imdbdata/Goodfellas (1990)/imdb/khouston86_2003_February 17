    This is a good movie, but I kind of know I am getting in bed with people
I don't want to associate with in praising it.  There are those--many--who
will just like the glorification of violence because they are shallow and
they have created some kind of false bravado in place of real courage.  In
other words, they are the kind of phonies who talk a big game and think they
are pimps, but haven't an ounce of sexiness, character or true backbone. <br /><br />     Now that I have dissociated myself from this group who likes the film,
I will say that Liotta delivers an outstanding performance, and that the
movie is very well done.  But it's just a movie, and not a life-changing
one.  (Neither is Fight Club, for many of the same reasons).  It definitely
is not &quot;The Godfather,&quot; but you need class to understand that.
