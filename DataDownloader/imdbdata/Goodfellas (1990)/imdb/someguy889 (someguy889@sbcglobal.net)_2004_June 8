&quot;After Joe Pesci's mother had seen the film, she told her son that the movie
was good, but asked him if he had to swear so much.&quot;<br /><br />Sure, there have been lots of good gangster movies. But this one seems to be
so different. I mean, there's the &quot;What do you mean I'm funny scene?&quot; There
the guy who says everything twice &quot;I'm gonna go get the papers, get the
papers.&quot; There the kid who gets shot in the foot for being slow with the
drinks. And there's the amazing story of Henry Hill as he becomes part of
the gangster world, becoming friends with fellow gangsters Robert De Niro
and Joe Pesci, getting involved in drug, murder, crime, while having a wife,
having kids, having a mistress, living the good life, getting high, turning
in his friends, becoming part of a Witness Protection program, betraying
everything that he had and grew to love and hate, doing the right and good
thing but missing it all so terribly much in the end, all while giving
amazing commentary to the whole movie, with wit, humor, tragedy, and a lot
of cuss words. The most truthful and one of the best gangster movies was
made in 1990, directed by Martin Scorsese. They were goodfellas.<br /><br />My grade: 9/10
