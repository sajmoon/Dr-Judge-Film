Martin Scorsese-directed modern-day mobster drama adapted from Nicholas
Pileggi&#39;s book &quot;Wiseguy&quot; by Scorsese and Pileggi involves Brooklyn
youth in 1955 who gets drawn into the gangster lifestyle, first as
their gopher, later as a major player. Joe Pesci is frightening as a
psychotic ball-buster and won a Supporting Actor Oscar, yet Ray Liotta
is even better in the central role, and Lorraine Bracco is excellent as
Liotta&#39;s wife. Exceptionally well-made film is gratuitous in its usage
of a certain expletive and cannot overcome one major obstacle: despite
its attempts to show the ugliness of Mafia life, the movie is
constantly undermined by a distinct romanticism of its own violence.
The infrequent narration by both Liotta and Bracco is a distraction, as
we are often being told exactly what we&#39;re seeing on the screen, but
the creeping paranoia is palpable and the drama played out is
disturbing and gripping. **1/2 from ****
