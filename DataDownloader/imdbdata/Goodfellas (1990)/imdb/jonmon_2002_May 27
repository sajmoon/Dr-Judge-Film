I admit it; I&#39;m an action movie guy. So a film about the mafia should
be right up my alley. But I&#39;m often turned off by dramas. It&#39;s not that
I don&#39;t respect those who like fine art. I do. But personally, I lack
the sophistication or training to appreciate the makeup or sets or
choreography if the plot is awful and the characters unlikeable.<br /><br />That&#39;s what gets in my way when I watch Goodfellas, which I&#39;ve seen
twice now but couldn&#39;t get through it the 2nd time. The protagonists
are nasty and I couldn&#39;t identify with them. This is the same thing
that turned me off watching &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;.<br /><br />Superb acting, story, some real drama -- but how ugly and why would I
want to watch this?<br /><br />Who should see this film:<br /><br />-- art types / drama lovers: a must-see<br /><br />-- action movie types who don&#39;t mind when the protagonist is violent
and awful<br /><br />Sorry, but at least I&#39;ve stated some real reasons for giving Goodfellas
only a 4 out of 10.
