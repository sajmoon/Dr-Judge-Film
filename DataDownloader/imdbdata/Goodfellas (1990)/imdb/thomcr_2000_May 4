This movie is a stunning cinematic achievement. At the core is Ray Liotta,
who should have been at least nominated for an Academy Award. You can
visibly see his transformation from a young, energetic gangster to an
older,
paranoid man constantly on the run. Complimenting his performance is the
beautiful Lorraine Bracco, one of the most underrated actresses working
today, who turns in a stellar (also Oscar-worthy) turn as his mob wife. The
rest of the cast is superb, most notably Joe Pesci who shines in his
Oscar-winning role. Scorsese picked nothing but the best when it came to
casting. The entire movie is backed by classic music which adapts to each
decade we're watching, starting in the 30's and 40's and ending up in the
80's.
The wedding, family dinners, jail scenes and the infamous nightclub are
nothing but genuine. I truly believe this movie should have received more
credit, awards and merit.
I was also happy to see that Robert DeNiro did not have a huge part in this
movie. As I respect him as being one of the greatest actors in recent
times,
Scorsese was wise in shifting attention of Liotta. It is not to say that
DeNiro had a small part, but it seemed that he was in a supporting role,
contrary to other gangster movies he has starred in, like &quot;Casino&quot; where he
is the main character.<br /><br />The best scene? Without a doubt, the 3 minutes when Liotta and Bracco enter
the Copacabana Nightclub through a sub-level entrance. As they wander
through the halls and corridors of the kitchen and waiting areas, viewers
get a first hand look at behind the scenes of a classic nightclub, all set
to &quot;The He Kissed Me&quot; by The Crystals.<br /><br />This is a fine piece of work Scorsese has created, and I strongly recommend
seeing it.
