This film is truly superb. Everything from the acting to the direction
flows
smoothly. Liotta lets us into the world of Henry Hill and we all get a
glimpse of the good times and the bad times of being a
hood.
Each character manages to slot perfectly into the individual roles and the
all star cast adds that extra bit of magic to this wonderful Scorsese
picture.  Accompanying Liotta's character are De Niro and Pesci and once
again they show us, just how well they can act.
From start to finish, each scene fits together and captivates the
audience.
You will either love the characters or hate them, but the film will do
nothing but impress.  If you haven't seen this film, you are missing out on
a truly classic movie.
