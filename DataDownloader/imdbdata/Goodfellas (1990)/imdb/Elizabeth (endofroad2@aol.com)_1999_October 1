I think this is a great movie.  Based on a true story, it shows how friends
go from pulling petty crimes to committing bloody murders.  Rat Liotta is
wonderful as Henry Hill, the small time gangster who eventually gets caught
up in the serious and deadly mob life.  Robert De Niro is brilliant, as
always, as Jimmy Conway.  And Joe Pesci is great (even if he's a little
vulgar) as Tommy De Vito, his Oscar winning role.  The saddest part is when
Tommy is really excited about getting in to the exclusive, 100% Italian
mafia, and then ends up getting killed.  I really feel Jimmy's pain when he
mourns the loss of his friend.  Even though they're really bad people, they
still have feelings for their friends. <br /><br />Martin Scorsese does a great job directing this mafia masterpiece.  I
definitely think that &quot;GoodFellas&quot; is a movie that everyone should see,
because in the end, Henry does what's right.  So I give &quot;GoodFellas&quot; a 9 out
of 10!
