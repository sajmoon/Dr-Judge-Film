...you should be shot!  This is the ultimate mob movie, and it really lives
up to its tagline of &quot;three decades of life in the Mafia&quot;.  Instead of being
a standard, point-A to point-B kinda movie, Goodfellas really gives you the
sense that you're watching someone's life unfold.  Just like in real life,
characters move in and out of Henry's life, appearing and disappearing from
view at random points in time.  We are treated to some &quot;precious moments&quot;
that might not help advance the very loose plot, but give us glimpses in
Henry's life.  For example, the long steadicam shot as Henry walks his
future wife Karen into the Copacabana, the famous &quot;funny&quot; sequence, and the
scene where Tommy's mother cooks the guy's dinner while they have a body in
the trunk really give you a sense that these are REAL people, not the
stereotypes in fedoras and slick suits that you often see in gangster
pictures.  I could write for hours about this film, but I don't know if
you'd want to read all that.
