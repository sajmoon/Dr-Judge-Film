My Age: 13<br /><br />Based on the book by Nicholas Pileggi (Wiseguy), GoodFellas follows Henry
Hills' life in the Mafia throughout three decades.  It begins when he is
just a kid associating with mobsters.  He meets James Conway, played by
Robert de Niro, and Tommy de Vito, played by Joe Pesci.  When he is older,
Henry, played by Ray Liotta, gets a wife, Karen, played by Lorraine Bracco. 
His new life involves various crimes including killing other gangsters and
beating up people for money.<br /><br />GoodFellas, directed by Martin Scorsese, is a very interesting and
intelligent look at life within the Mafia.  It has a few camera shots that
last a few minutes without cutting, which are very good to look at.  I would
warn the faint-hearted to avoid this, because there is a fair amount of
violence and gore.  The story of Henry Hill's life is told very well, and
the character is portrayed well by Ray Liotta.  Robert de Niro, Joe Pesci
and Lorraine Bracco are also very good in their roles.  In the end,
GoodFellas is a very good film, one that I would recommend.<br /><br />Australian Classification: R 18+: Occasional Graphic Violence and Very
Frequent Coarse Language<br /><br />Rating: 82 out of 100
