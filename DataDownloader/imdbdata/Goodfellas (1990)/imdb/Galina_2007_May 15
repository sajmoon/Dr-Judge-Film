What a wonderful inspiring film-making by the only director who could
possible make the film, the undisputed classic. The cast is superb, the
pace - incredible; 145 minutes simply flew by. My beloved &quot;Sopranos&quot;,
all six seasons of it could fit perfectly like in a case in these 145
minutes. Ultra-violent, mesmerizing, enthralling, &quot;GoodFellas&quot; is an
unforgettable wild ride. I have not seen the film for a while and what
a great fun it was to re-watch it again and I know it always will be.<br /><br />Favorite scene - after Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) and Jimmy Conway
(Robert De Niro) killed Billy Batts, they and Henry Hill stopped at
Tommy&#39;s mother (Mrs. Scorsese) house. The contrast between earlier
horrifying scene at the bar and the nice family dinner is simply
breathtaking.
