This has everything a movie should have. A great story, acting,
cinematography, direction, (I will never understand how Scorsese did
not win his 1st Oscar!) production values, I can go on and on. There is
nothing that isn&#39;t done perfectly on this film. If this were to come
out in any given year it would be considered a classic. I understand
that there are the hardcore devotee&#39;s to The 1st two Godfather films,
but to me (and many others) this is the quintessential gangster film. I
used to watch this film over and over and I usually try and nitpick
even some of of the all time great films, but there is nothing I can
pick on in this film! I had kind of seen Scorsese films before and
really liked most of them, (Taxi Driver, &amp; Raging Bull especially) but
ever since &quot;Goodfellas&quot; I would follow everything he did. I didn&#39;t
follow the Oscars when I was a kid, but was shocked to learn this
didn&#39;t win Best Picture however the fact that &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; did
was one of the few times I wish the Oscar should could have been
shared. As much as I loved &quot;Wolves&quot; &quot;Goodfellas&quot; has held up as the
better picture. If you haven&#39;t seen this film and consider your self a
serious film afectiando you need to see this before you are laughed at
by actual filmphiles.
