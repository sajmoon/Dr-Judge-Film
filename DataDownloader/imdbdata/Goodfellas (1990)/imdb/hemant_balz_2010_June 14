Scorsese brings to us another of his masterpieces.After the score of
Raging Bull he brings a gangster flick to us that just tears us
apart.Best since the time of the Godfather.Or i can say you can compare
it even to the Godfather.This is tied for me as the best film of
Gangster era i have seen with the Godfather Part 2.The casting is
perfect.Robert De Niro,Joe Pesci &#x26; Ray Liotta are all superb.Lorraine
Bracco is sensational.Paul Sorvino reminds us of the dons used to be in
that of the Godfather.The story never looses tempo.Audience tries to
predict the ending but then is just not able to predict the end.The
narration of Liotta is fabulous.Gripping narration &#x26; perfect crime
gangster flick.Scorsese should have got the Oscar for this one.The
entry of the drugs &#x26; narcotics later on just adds so much more to the
film.Based on a true story its a terrific adaptation with pretty cool
dialogs like 100% Italian stuff.Henry Hill said as far back as he
remembered,he always wanted to be a gangster.But surely for the acting
of Joe Pesci,for the presence of De Niro,for the narration of Ray
Loitta,for the brilliance of Scorsese,as far as i remember,i ain&#x27;t
gonna forget this one for a long time to come.
