2004_December 21 
To me, this is the best film ever made. A bold statement you may think,
but I the minute I saw Henry Hill utter the famous line of: &quot;As far
back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster&quot;, followed
by the kick of Tony Bennet's Rags to Riches, I knew I was in for
something special.<br /><br />In the hands of any other director, this could have been a
straightforward adaptation of Pileggi's &quot;Wise Guy&quot;. Yet with Scorsese,
the film is injected with an important dose of life - something I
thought was slightly missing from The Godfather series. The
relationships are so close and warm between these goodfellas, something
that was absent from the cold relationships in Casino(1995).<br /><br />The actors react well to each other - the main actors being superb.
Liotta has never been better as he was as Henry Hill, the man seduced
by the mob life. Pesci never reached the great heights he did in this
film, as the only 5ft5 man I know who can scare me. De Niro is doing
what he does best, and that is playing the gangster, but in an
understated fashion, never going into parody. Yet like most good films,
it is the small things that make a difference - and there is no
exception here. Even the minor roles are fully fleshed out, as if there
is a life behind the story of Hnery Hill. Like Mickey Eyes...or
Anthony...Jimmy Two Times (on the account that he says everything
twice). The sheer density of the characters is to be commended.<br /><br />Scorsese has the knack of timing his music to the action that occurs on
screen. But this isn't just a song played in its entirety (something
Tarantino would do) - instead Scorsese chops and changes his songs,
halfway through a scene. Take for example the &quot;1980's&quot; scenes, where
Hill is in a fit of paranoia whilst delivering the guns to Jimmy and
picking up drugs for himself. From the start of this powerful section
of the film, we get Nilsson's &quot;jump into the fire&quot;, followed by some
Muddy Waters, mixed in with the Stones - to a dizzying effect, until we
end this section with &quot;Jump into the fire&quot; again. Pure genius.<br /><br />This is also seen in the &quot;Layla&quot; montage - the piano exit of Eric
Clapton's Layla introducing us to the fall of the gangsters who knew
too much about the heist. From the pink cadilac, to the meat locker
with Frankie Carbone in it - it is a beautiful scene, with so many
great techniques on offer. I could go on forever with the amount of
great scenes in this movie that work with the music (Billy Batts murder
with Donovan's Atlantis...Tracking shot of Jimmy with Cream's Sunshine
of my love...) - but that is for you to watch and experience.<br /><br />Goodfellas is a film lovers film. It has a great story (great narration
too), superb acting from all, beautiful cinematography (Copacobana
scene comes to mind, also with the visceral tracking shots) and the all
seeing eye - Scorsese. Goodfellas is a film that is as violent as it is
funny, a sense of humour in Scorsese's work also seen in King of Comedy
and After Hours. This is Scorsese's (and in my humble opinion any
director's) work. That is something considering how fantastic Raging
Bull and Taxi Driver are.<br /><br />Visceral, violent and film lover's dream.
