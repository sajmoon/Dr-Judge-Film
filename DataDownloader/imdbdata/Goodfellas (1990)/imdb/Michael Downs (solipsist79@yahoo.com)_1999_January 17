Mob films are a popular genre, and a lot of very gifted filmmakers have
turned their talents to them.  Scorsese's best attempt so far has indeed
been 'Goodfellas'.  It is a very well filmed, very well acted and very
entertaining crime movie.  It's the sort of movie that film students like.
However I feel what it lacks is a heart.  'Goodfellas' just isn't moving or
emotional enough.  I don't believe it's the best, or even _one_ of the best
crime movies of recent times.<br /><br />If you want an elaborate tale of several decades in the life of the mafia
then watch the 'Godfather' movies.  If you want a realistic look into life
for the average 'wiseguy' then watch 'Donnie Brasco'.  If you want a hip
crime flic with great dialogue, then watch 'Pulp Fiction'.  Goodfellas is
simply outclassed by these three films.<br /><br />8/10 - An imperfect but honorable addition to the genre.
