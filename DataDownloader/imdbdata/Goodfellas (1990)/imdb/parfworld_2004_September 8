Well I must agree with LeightWinst, Goodfellas is THE best gangster
film of all time and dare we say it the best film of all time. However,
I must disagree with LW when he says &quot;the editing has no consistency in
parts&quot;. Surely the film's editing is what elevates it above the norm
into the great. The film is not a three hour patience tester. In fact
it seems the perfect length, no over indulgence, just story telling.
Three scenes spring to mind: the opening (f*#king awesome), Jimmy's
cull to the sound of God (Clapton) and the cooking sequence near the
drug bust.These scenes not only involve the viewer, they drag him into
a film which is about, the most despicable characters ever created -
and we love them. One more, the bar scene, when no editing is required
it's not used (I know he tried it before in MS but not nearly as
effectively). What can you say about the man? It seems to be the most
unthoughtful of the films he has made but when you look at it, you
realize that this is the distilled version of Scorsese - And that's a
mighty fine drop!
