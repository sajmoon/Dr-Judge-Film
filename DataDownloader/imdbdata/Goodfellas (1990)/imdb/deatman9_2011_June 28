Alright this is going to be a long review because i have so much to say
about this film. First off this one of the or the best mafia film ever
made. It stars a bang up cast of world class actors, ray liotta, joe
pesci, robert deniro, paul sorvino and the list goes on and on. It was
written and dircted by Martin Scorscese who is considered by many to be
the best film maker of all time.<br /><br />This movie follows the true story of Henry Hill (Liotta) a young man
who started working for the mob when he was just a teenager. The movie
gives a very detailed view of his life and all the trouble he faced
through out it.<br /><br />This is easily Ray Liottas finest hour and this movie is the reason he
even got into Hollywood. Also it has a bang up performances from Robert
deniro and joe pesci. Mob movies would not be the same without those
two in them. This movie all comes together perfectly made possible by
the fantastic writing of Scorsese and the immaculate acting of all
those involved. I highly recommend this to everyone hands down the best
mafia film ever made
