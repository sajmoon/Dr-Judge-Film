Ray Liotta makes dominates this film. Another (I'm using this word again)
BRILLIANT film about life in the Mafia. This, Casino, and all The Godfathers
are essential viewings. Once again, everyone in the cast is perfect,
especially Joe Pesci (he is hilarious in his role as Tommy), Liotta and I
especially enjoyed Lorraine Bracco's performance as Karen, Henry's
long-suffering wife. She puts up with so much from him. Scorsese is also one
of my favorite directors, and this is his best film. 4 stars, since I can't
give it 5. Pure genius.
