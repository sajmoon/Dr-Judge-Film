I first watched this movie a few years ago and it blew me away. The way
the
characters change and develop over the years and eventually turn on each
other is a wonderful piece of storytelling. Made so much better because
it's
based on a true story.
It captures the atmosphere, fashions and music of the era perfectly. It
could be accused of glamourising organized crime, but the brutal killings
put an end to this.
If you have not seen this movie, I strongly recomend it!
10/10
