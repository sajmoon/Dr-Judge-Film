Goodfellas (1990) <br /><br />**** (out of 4) <br /><br />Martin Scorsese&#x27;s masterpiece about Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a man who
grew up hoping to be in the mob and he got his but crime does not pay
as the old saying goes. GOODFELLAS has been called one of the greatest
mob movies ever made and it&#x27;s been called the best film of the 90s as
well as one of the greatest films ever made. It certainly goes on my
list as one of the greatest movies ever made and each time I view the
thing I can&#x27;t help but be amazed at the brilliance on screen. It&#x27;s
really does seem as if this isn&#x27;t a movie because the thing is so
perfect in every way that it&#x27;s almost hard to believe that it&#x27;s real.
Even though everything in this movie is great there&#x27;s no doubt that
every ounce of credit belongs to Scorsese.<br /><br />There have been wonderful crime pictures going all the way back to the
silent days so the director was behind the eight ball but instead of
just delivering a great movie he instead goes all out and really
creates a film unlike anything we&#x27;ve ever seen before. The way he films
the violence, shows the good times and the bad times. Everything is so
flawless that you really do forget that you&#x27;re watching a movie because
it comes off like you&#x27;re a fly on the wall witnessing all of this stuff
first hand. There&#x27;s the now legendary camera shot going through the
restaurant, there&#x27;s the terrific music score and of course the violence
that really shakes you. One could argue that we&#x27;ve seen this type of
story countless times but it&#x27;s so fresh here that you can&#x27;t help but
feel as if you&#x27;re seeing it for the first time.<br /><br />There are so many brilliant moments here but special credit has to go
to the final twenty-minutes or so when Hill finally starts to crack due
to all the drugs. The fast-paced nature of this sequence is among the
most perfect filming you&#x27;re ever going to see because by the time it&#x27;s
over you&#x27;re going to think that you too are high on drugs. Another
amazing thing that Scorsese does is get you into the events in these
people&#x27;s lives. The good times early on are so much fun that you can
see why someone would select to be in the lifestyle. The camera doesn&#x27;t
shy away from capturing these moments including the high times in the
nightclubs with the women and the money. However, Scorsese also nails
the downside when everything starts to crumble and the violence is so
shocking and brutal that you then realize that this lifestyle only ends
one way and you&#x27;re thankful that you&#x27;re not involved in it.<br /><br />Another major plus are of course the performances. Liotta is perfect in
the role of Hill and especially when you consider he must carry the
film over the more famous actors. I thought Liotta perfectly nailed not
only the young, energetic Hill but he really pulled off the drug-crazed
maniac. DeNiro, as usual, is also terrific in his part as he brings so
much fire and energy to the character and can cause you to fear him
with just a look. Joe Pesci deserves his Best Supporting Actor Oscar as
there&#x27;s no doubt that he delivers one of the finest villain roles in
the history of film. Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino are also
impressive as are the rest of the supporting players even down to the
bit parts.<br /><br />GOODFELLAS is without question one of the greatest films ever made and
like all classics it&#x27;s a movie that keeps getting better each passing
year. Scorsese has made many great films in his career and this here is
certainly among his best.
