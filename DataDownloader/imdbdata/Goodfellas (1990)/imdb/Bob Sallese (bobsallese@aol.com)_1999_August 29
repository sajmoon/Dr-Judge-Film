1999_August 29 

I've probably watched this movie at least 20 times and not only is it
Scorsese's best but it is the best film ever made. Ray Liotta gives his
finest performance and Deniro and Pesci are incredible.  Of course, the
Academy robbed Scorsese of yet another Oscar.  What a shame! <br /><br />Also note that the soundtrack is fantastic and really works perfectly to
make this film one perfect piece of art.<br /><br />
