# 1 Film of 1990<br /><br />There are numerous amounts of fantastic movies out there, but the
special ones are few and far between. One of the most special motion
pictures ever created was a film that combined brutal and painfully
realistic violence, grittiness, a great composition of the music of
60s, 70s and 80s, a compelling storyline, authentic dialogue,
incendiary narrative storytelling and a hell of a lot style. It was
known as 'GoodFellas', veteran filmmaker Martin Scorsese's
extraordinary mob film, that was a landmark in cinema because it
superseded 'The Godfather', in my opinion. Many people agree
'GoodFellas' outranks 'Godfather' but many disagree also. In a
nutshell, 'The Godfather' is what started it all, it's a stylish,
super-cool Oscar-Winner with fantastic acting but 'GoodFellas' paints a
more updated portrait of life in organized crime, and unlike
'Godfather' shows the severe consequences and results that come with
being a 'wise guy'. 'GoodFellas' is an amazing movie that will no doubt
impress you if you take the time to view it.<br /><br />The film begins with a grown-up Hill riding in a car with two other mob
associates, the slick, cool and smooth spoken Jimmy Conway (Robert
DeNiro) and the psychopathic and violent mental midget Tommy DeVito
(Joe Pesci - in his Academy Award- winning role.) It's late at night
and both look exhausted and they hear a thumping in the bank of the
trunk and wonder what is going on. They pull of to the side of the
road, open the trunk to reveal a older gentleman severely beaten up and
bloody pleading, 'please, don't. please.' Tommy then takes a butcher
knife and continues to aggressively stab him while Jimmy shoots him
several times with a revolver. They close the trunk and the camera pans
to Hill's face and he narrates, 'As far back as I can remember I always
wanted to be a gangster.'. After that moment, viewing the rented DVD
from Blockbuster, I knew I was in for a powerful, realistic, gritty but
astonishing motion picture.<br /><br />The dark and beautifully shot feature 'GoodFellas' follows the true
story of mob associate Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and his rags-to-riches
tale starting as a poor fresh-faced Irish-Italian kid in slums of
Brooklyn running numbers for low-level hoods to working along side of
major mob players. Hill was a boy obsessed with how the mafia worked
and like most kids dreamed of being an astronaut, fireman, or president
of the United States, he dreamed of being a wise guy. The movie then
follows Hill's live in the mob until the 80s. I can't really tell you
too much without giving the film away, but I can tell you he encounters
interesting situations and the movie never ceases to be wild and
entertaining. It's definitely the best mafia film ever made.<br /><br />There are many things to praise about Scorsese's most talked about
motion picture 'GoodFellas'. First of all is the acting. All the
performers, every one of them, are at the top of their game. Ray Liotta
gives a strong performance as the film's narrator and main character,
Henry Hill, while Robert DeNiro gives an absolutely riveting
performance out-shining Liotta in almost every scene they share. It's a
shame DeNiro wasn't nominated for an Oscar for the wonderful job he did
in 'GoodFellas'. Lorraine Bracco impresses as Liotta's sassy but
ultimately typical Italian-mob wife, while Joe Pesci is extraordinary
and ferocious in his scene-stealing role as the blood-hungry and crazy
paisan, Tommy DeVito, whom everyone is afraid of. Paul Sorvino rounds
out the leading cast as the tough but quiet mob boss, while the film is
packed with small roles played by such actors as Vincent Pastore, Tony
Darrow, Mike Starr, Chuck Leow, Tony Sirico, Henny Youngman, Frank
Vincent, Frank Sivero and Samuel L. Jackson. Martin Scorsese provides
direction so brilliant you really can't put it into words, that should
have won him the 'Best Director' Oscar at the 1991 Academy Awards
Ceremony. Scorsese and Nicholas Pilleggi (who wrote the novel which
'GoodFellas' is based upon) provide one of the richest and finest
screenplays ever created, and Thelma Schoonmaker provides marvelous
editing.<br /><br />There are really no dull parts about this tough and brutal but
beautiful and brilliant masterpiece from one of our generations best
filmmakers, Martin Scorsese. If you haven't already and don't mind a
little grit (actually a lot of grit) make it a mission to drive to
Blockbuster and rent this movie on DVD. 'GoodFellas' is one of the best
and most memorable films ever made. I think you'll enjoy it. Grade: A<br /><br />MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT # 13
