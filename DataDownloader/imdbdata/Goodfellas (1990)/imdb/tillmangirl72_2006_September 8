The best movie ever made. MARTIN SCORCE will never top this movie.<br /><br />IT Doesn&#39;t Get Any Better Then This. It Is a movie You Will Never stop
Thinking About. The background music has a lot of meaning.It really
makes you experience whats going on.<br /><br />When you finally get to see the real Henry Hill in real life its kind
of disappointing. He really looks like and acts like Maury the wig man
on the show.You have to give him credit ,only someone who lived through
could come up with a story like this. this is a movie for young adults
all the way to old people. This is the best movie ever,I only had to
buy it at least 8 times-this time I wrote my name on it!
