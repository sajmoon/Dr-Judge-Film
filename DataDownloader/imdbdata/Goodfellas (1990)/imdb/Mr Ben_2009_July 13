There are certain films that change cinema, films that are less about
entertainment and more about painting a glorious canvas onto the silver
screen that marks a shift in direction all movies must now follow.
&#x22;Casablanca&#x22;, &#x22;The Great Ditactor&#x22;, &#x22;Star Wars&#x22;, &#x22;Citizen Kane&#x22;, films
that alter the way you look at the medium - whether you like them or
not, you still appreciate the craftsmanship that went into making the
film. Personally, I&#x27;m not big on gangster movies but I believe that
&#x22;Goodfellas&#x22; should be included on that list and judging by its
near-permanent position at the top end of the IMDb&#x27;s top 250, so do
lots of others.<br /><br />Ray Liotta plays Henry Hill, a young man growing up in New York in the
Sixties and slowly working his way into the schemes of local mob boss
Paul Cicero (Paul Sivero) alongside the psychotic Tommy DeVito (a
menacing Joe Pesci) and the cool-headed hit-man Jimmy Conway (Robert De
Nero. As the years go by, Henry&#x27;s success brings him riches beyond his
wildest dreams but it also comes at a price. His marriage to Karen
(Lorraine Bracco) is built on shaky ground and as the stakes get ever
higher, Henry finds himself increasingly isolated as friends and
associates either desert him or get whacked.<br /><br />Setting the bar for gangster movies ever since, &#x22;Goodfellas&#x22; is one of
those landmark pictures that deserves respect. Like &#x22;The Godfather&#x22;
before it, this feels horrifyingly authentic and utterly convincing but
seeing as this is a Scorsese flick, that shouldn&#x27;t come as a surprise.
What does shock is how good Pesci is. He is like a mini stick of
dynamite in a suit, ready to explode at a moment&#x27;s notice and you
simply can&#x27;t take your eyes of him. Right from the infamous &#x22;What&#x27;s so
funny?&#x22; scene, Pesci owns this film. Liotta and De Niro, seasoned bad
guy actors in their own right, can&#x27;t hold a candle to him - indeed,
Pesci has struggled to escape this role ever since. But all cast
members are faultless in &#x22;Goodfellas&#x22;, another Scorsese trademark. And
yet another is a supreme soundtrack and like &#x22;The Departed&#x22;, this is
also a great film to listen to with songs you wouldn&#x27;t expect to hear -
the piano exit to &#x22;Layla&#x22; gives the whole film an epic feel that raises
the hair on the back of your neck.<br /><br />It may lack the grandeur of &#x22;The Godfather&#x22; or the scale of &#x22;Once Upon
A Time In America&#x22; but what makes &#x22;Goodfellas&#x22; unmissable, in my
opinion, is how utterly convincing it is as a mob film. This feels as
raw, violent and brutal as you&#x27;d expect and at times, you&#x27;re watching
through your fingers at these (let&#x27;s face it) pretty reprehensible
individuals indulging in a life of crime and violence seemingly
untouchable by the law. My only real complaint, and it is slight, is
that because it feels so real that I can&#x27;t really call it entertaining
- you wouldn&#x27;t put it on TV while you having dinner, for example. So
this is less a film and more of an event, something special that any
movie fan worthy of the label owes it to themselves to watch. Being as
this is only the second Scorsese film I&#x27;ve seen, I will admit to liking
&#x22;The Departed&#x22; more but this is still a supremely good film, full of
menace and tension throughout. So be a wise-guy and go get the DVD or
else I&#x27;ll send Fat Tony over to whack you!
