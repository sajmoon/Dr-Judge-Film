1999_July 16 

It is not often that I am lost for words after watching a film, indeed
normally it is the infernal rage within me that makes me want to scream,
notably after seeing Batman and Robin. However the first time that I saw
Goodfellas, about 6 years ago, it as good as changed the way I look at
movies.
I was dumbfounded by the sheer speed of the action and the dialogue. The
performances were almost faultless (how Dances with Wolves won the oscars I
will never understand) and the most impressive thing that stuck with me was
the soundtrack. The way that Scorsese used certain music to convey emotion
was to an extent that I had not seen before. Indeed the growing paranoia
encompassed by Robert De Niro toward the end of the film, is expressed
effortlessly when the camera pans towards him in the bar and the guitars
from Cream's &quot;sunshine of your love,&quot; come into effect, this gives me the
shivers every time I see it.
OK there have been films with better cinematography (the Deerhunter par
example) however this still remains the film that has had the most
influence
on my life, especially with the rest of the trash that we have had to put
up
with this decade.
