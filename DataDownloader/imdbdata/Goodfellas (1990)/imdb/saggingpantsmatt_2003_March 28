Lots the godfather trilogy is better,but I disagree.I think all the<br /><br />characters in the movie are good,and deniro does a nice job as playing<br /><br />the 2nd tier role. Pesci is wonderful as the boss and really proves he<br /><br />is a good actor. This is probablly liotta's best film,before going to<br /><br />movies like cornia cor
