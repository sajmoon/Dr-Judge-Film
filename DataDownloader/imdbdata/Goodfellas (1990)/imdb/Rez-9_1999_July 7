1999_July 7 

I first saw Goodfellas when I was 14 years old. I remember being
completely in awe with this film. Ray Liotta gives a performance so Oscar
worthy - that the fact he never won shocked me. Joe Pesci is incredible,
in
a disturbing 'Pesci' manner. If you have never seen this movie before,
three
words for ya &quot;RENT IT NOW!&quot; *****
