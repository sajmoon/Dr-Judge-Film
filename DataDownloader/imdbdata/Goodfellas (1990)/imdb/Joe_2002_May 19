Mafia Movies are my thing so I know and seen them all. I have to say that
Goodfellas was great! Beautifully written. It gave a great detail on the
famous turncoat( Doublecrosser) Henry Hill. Joe Pesci was GREAT! Robert
DeNiro was also great and so was Ray! I give this movie a 10! I love it!
Def
one of my favorites!
