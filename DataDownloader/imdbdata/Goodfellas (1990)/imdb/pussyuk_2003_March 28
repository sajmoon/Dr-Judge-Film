goodfellas, classic. one word genius. I first got the privalage of seeing
this film a couple of years ago, i was absolutely gobsmaecked to say the
very least.
Ok, martin is a  great director, hes had  some poor films , like any
before
him , but you just forget those specific faliures when u witness this film
and a couple similiar films by martin such has casino, taxi driver and
most
recently the gangs of new york.
Ray liotta is a great actor and he deserves a  notice for this one. his
ability to play himself occasional may shadow out,but who else could have
pulled this role off , very few , maybe de niro but then who whould have
played de niro?????
Watch this one , even if to prove people and 80% of actors , audiences and
the entity of the world, that this isnt a  good movie ,.
