Before  I had seen this film in 1992 the best film I had ever seen was the
Breakfast club which isn't bad but this introduced me to whole new world
that I have yet to come out of .<br /><br />From the opening scene to the end credits everything else in my life
including my exams were forgotten about, Robert De Niro is outstanding as is
Joe Pesci but Ray Liotta gives a performance so immense that it is unlikely
he will ever emerge from its shadow .<br /><br />Martin Scorcese gives a directing master class as I would go out on a limb
to say visually this is the most stylish film you will ever see I will not
continue to go on and there are no more words that I could put down that
could possibly do this film the justice it rightly deserves.
