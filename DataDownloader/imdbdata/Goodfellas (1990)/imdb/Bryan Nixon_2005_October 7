Goodfellas, along with Pulp Fiction, Schindler's List, Saving Private
Ryan, and Se7en, is one of the very best of the movies that the 1990's
had to offer. In my review for Casino, I said that I believed that
Casino was slightly better than Goodfellas. I think that Casino is
underrated, because Goodfellas is all the rage and Casino seemed to get
sloppy seconds because both of these films are so similar in style,
context, and nature. Casino just seemed like it flowed better than
Goodfellas, but, as I said before, just slightly. For me, it's like
comparing The Godfather and The Godfather Part 2. It's just so close
that the winner of the race is hard to call. However, Goodfellas is an
amazing piece of cinema that should have been awarded the best picture
Oscar. It was daring and new, and it does deserve its place in the top
50 movies of all time on this site. Martin Scorsese is a master
director who is a force to be reckoned with. Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci
light up the screen, too. Roger Ebert said that he felt that Goodfellas
was better than The Godfather. I do not agree with that statement,
because I do not feel that it is better than The Godfather or The
Godfather Part 2. These films are just so amazing. Goodfellas deserves
its place as one of the greatest American films. I just think that
Casino deserves some time in the spotlight, as well.
