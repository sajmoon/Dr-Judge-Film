1999_March 3 

I've watched this one over and over and it never fails to entertain me and
hold my attention to the very end. The editing and camera work is
astounding. Everything from the performances to the story to the music is
perfect. There are so many perfect shots, perfect combinations of music and
cutting, still frame with voice-over....DeNiro sitting at the bar, scowling
and smoking, and Sunshine of Your Love kicks in. It's ineffable.<br /><br />To throw out a different perspective, after I watched Saving Private Ryan at
the theatre for some reason I began comparing it to GoodFellas. Perhaps
because Ryan is being praised as the best film ever, but more likely because
of the transition from one scene to the next and how Spielberg and Scorsese
handled them.
Watching Ryan a second time it seemed very choppy, as if each scene had been
stitched on to the next to form some sort of patchwork quilt. But GoodFellas
is like a symphony which gets better every time. The music and
cinematography are almost lyrical in their movements. Spielberg may have
some original ideas, but Scorsese is the master.
