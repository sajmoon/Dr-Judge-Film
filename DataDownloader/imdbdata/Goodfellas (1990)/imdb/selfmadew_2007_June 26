Martin Scorsese - I never really felt the things he puts in the movies.
His stile is slow, imaginary, unconvincing... half if not most of the
characters act roles that don&#39;t belong to them... I mean I&#39;m sitting
here watching the movie for like twenty minutes and what I think about
mainly is what was the point of the story - twenty minutes and it takes
you nowhere...? Well gentlemen, I have some more interesting things to
do with my time. I mean the only class in this act is De Niro, though
what is he doing in such a boring product?!? What I said and all I said
is of course in my own opinion. Pleople who enjoy Scorsese&#39;s
inconceivable &quot;tallent&quot; for making stories... - have a nice time. Me -
I already know... never watch Scorsese movies.
