1999_May 19 
<br /><br />A true class act, this film breaks new barriers in violence and
excitement.<br /><br />There are always the stupid people who moan and moan about the violence
BUT
I LOVE IT.<br /><br />De Niro - As Always - is marvelous, Ray Liotta too is excellent but the
star
of the show was definitely Joe Pesci as the maniacal Tommy DeVito, WHAT I
AMUSE YOU!!!<br /><br />There are so many excellent set pieces, the trademark Scorsese camera
work,
this is a true classic and the third best gangster film ever. (third to
godfathers 1 &amp; 2)<br /><br />
