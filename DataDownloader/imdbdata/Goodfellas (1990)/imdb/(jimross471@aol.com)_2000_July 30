I Can't see how any one would rate Pulp Fiction as better than this
flawless
Mafia masterpiece starring my favourite actor (De Niro) and by my favourite
director (Scorsese). It was a crime that this won only won one Oscar (for
Pesci). There are far too many classic lines and scenes to list here and
the
soundtrack is outstanding (much better than anything Tarantino could put
out). You must see this now.
