Actor Robert DeNiro and director Martin Scorsese are among the very best in
their respective fields. They have been a very successful team on such
classic films as Raging Bull, Mean Streets, Casino and Cape Fear. Goodfellas
is the very best film they've made together. It is the best mob movie ever
made and 
probably the best of the 1990's. <br /><br />Goodfellas is about as good as a movie can be. The story, the acting,
directing, the music used all blend together perfectly. Ray Liotta, a
terrific and underappreciated actor, plays Henry Hill, who gets involved as
a kid with the local mobsters in his neighborhood. It is based on a true
story told in Nick Pilleggi's book &quot;Wiseguy&quot;. Joe Pesci won an Oscar for his
supporting role. The cast also includes such stars as DeNiro, Paul Sorvino
and Lorraine Bracco as Henry's wife. There are alot of classic movie
moments, including a hilarious scene with Catherine Scorsese as Pesci's
mother. <br /><br />Goodfellas is an awesome movie. When it's over, you don't feel like you've
sat there for 2 and a half hours. It's the kind of movie you can watch
repeatedly and never get bored. This movie easily gets a &quot;10&quot; on my scale.
