Goodfellas is The Best Gangster Movie I&#39;ve ever seen. Martin Scorsese
does a Fantastic job by giving us this Genius of a movie. Robert De
Niro is great as usual in a Superb performance. Ray Llioto delivers his
Best performance in his career. Joe Pesci was Fantastic, half the
movie&#39;s entertainment was because of his character Tommy. Lorraine
Braco was efficient in a key role. There are many other supporting
actors in this movie including Samuel L Jackson. This deserves to be at
least in the Top 5 Best Films ever. Goodfellas has great acting, Great
direction, good script and dialogues. The Violence has been portrayed
amazingly. If you want 2 in a half hours of Entertainment then watch
Goodfellas.
