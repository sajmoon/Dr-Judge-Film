Goodfellas is one of those movies that you can't help to enjoy. From the
classic opening sequence in the car to the freeze-frame snapshots, there is
something about it that instantly makes you want to root for the bad guys.
After reading the book, I knew that I just had to see the film and having
watched it many times, can't count the number of wonderful scenes that I now
know nearly by heart. Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci play brilliant characters who
have just the slightest psychotic tendencies to them, and Robert DeNiro is
excellent as the almost fatherly figure for them. I would definitely
recommend it to anyone who likes good movies. Film of the
Nineties.
