Poor Scorcese. The man who deserve-th an Oscar. This should have been
his second (or third) for Best Director. This is storytelling at its
best. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way
through. I love the way Martin freezes the frames every now and then
while Liotta's character provides excellent narration. Joe Pesci's
character almost makes the movie on its own. Deniro is also in top form
on this one. One way I like to describe this movie is that its kind of
the Mafia 101. The narration takes you through all the ins and outs of
the Mafia. What more can I say - THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT FILM IN THE
HISTORY OF CINEMA!!!!!
