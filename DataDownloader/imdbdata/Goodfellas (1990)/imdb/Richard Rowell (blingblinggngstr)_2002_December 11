I was extrememly satisfied with this movie. I liked the whole feel of the
movie and the way Ray Liotta told the story, it made me really see the world
of gangsters. The little clever things that he would do throughout the movie
was really appealing, but then slowly everything begins to deteroirate
towards the end. De Niro and Pesci both give good performances too. I liked
the part when Joe Pesci was messing with Ray Liotta about when he said he
was a funny guy, me and my friends act out that part occasionally, its a bit
silly. This is one of those movies that you enjoy watching, and it takes a
while to get tired of watching it.
