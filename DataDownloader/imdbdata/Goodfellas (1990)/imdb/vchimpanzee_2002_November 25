I was hoping Joe Pesci would be more like in his comedy movies.  There were
some great looking cars and great songs early in the movie, but other than
that there wasn't much to make this movie appealing.  I only watched it
because of Pesci and the movie's many honors or at least nominations for
them.  Paul Sorvino did a good acting job.  But the people in this movie
were not very nice at all.  I knew they wouldn't be, but they just killed
people like it was an everyday thing.  And I can't imagine what the language
would have been like if I hadn't seen the tv version.  I just wouldn't have
bothered otherwise.
