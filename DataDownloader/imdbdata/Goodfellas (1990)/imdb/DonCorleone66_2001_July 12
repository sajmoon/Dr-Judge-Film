this has got to be one of my favorite movies of all time.  Let's start by
saying Martin Scorcese is awesome.  This has got to be one of the most
entertaining and interesting movies of all time.  All 3 actors are
excellent
and it's a shame that Ray Liotta wasn't nominated for an oscar in this
movie.  Joe Pesci is perfect as Tommy the crazy ass lunatic mobster and is
well deserved of the oscar he was awarded.  Robert De Niro shows us again
why he is one of the greatest actors of all time.  Ray Liotta shines in
this
movie as Henry Hill and I could not have picked another actor to play the
part.  The cast and screenplay compliment each other perfectly.  The movie
is impeccable and helps to bring to life an already amazing book (Wise Guy
by Nicholas Pileggi)
