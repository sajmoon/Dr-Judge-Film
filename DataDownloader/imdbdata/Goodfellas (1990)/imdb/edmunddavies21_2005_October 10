Goodfellas is a gangster film classic, not to be missed by those who
love gangster films. I saw the film in the movie section of a TV
magazine. but i thought it was on sky movies and i do not have sky
movies, but the film was actually on turner classic movies (TCM for
short) but when i found that out, i had missed it. So i then bought the
film on 2-disc special edition DVD. I hadn't seen the film before i
watched it on DVD but i was hoping that i would like the film or it
would be a waste of the &pound;10 i paid for it. but i loved it.<br /><br />The film has an amazing plot but i don't want to spoil the plot for you
so watch the film and find out. The film has an excellent cast and all
the actors acted at their very best.<br /><br />if you love gangster films SEE THIS NOW! 10/10 Excellent film thanks
for reading
