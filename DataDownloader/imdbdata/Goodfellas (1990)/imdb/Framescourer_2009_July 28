A classic wiseguy flick, a classic Scorsese. It&#x27;s dynamic, funny, and
rewrites the accepted lines of exhilaration and disgust by mixing
panache and violence. Scorsese has created a great document of the
mobster life that can stand alongside Coppola&#x27;s famous Godfather films.
Yet he&#x27;s done it in his own inimitable style, bursting with the energy
of the four decades it takes in.<br /><br />From the off the film&#x27;s temperament is dictated by Ray Liotta&#x27;s
career-defining role as Henry. His behaviour is dictated entirely by
self- interest - Liotta manages to establish a wonderfully neurotic,
porous self-awareness that means he&#x27;s always an outsider trying too
hard to please the paymaster... most of the time that means Paul
Sorvino&#x27;s outstanding, pre-Gandolfini capo, and of course very
different bosses call his tune at the denouement. The film is also
notoriously a playpen for the more outr&#xE9; behaviour of Joe Pesci, a
guilty delight. Lorraine Braco is equal to her considerable supporting
role as Liotta&#x27;s moll. 8/10
