Every line is memorable as the next, as snappy as the last, Goodfellas
brings a treat to fans of almost every genre. Joe Pesci(Home Alone) is the
real star alongside Robert De Niro(Ronin) and Ray Liotta(who frankly lets
the movie down). Martin Scorcesse directs an almost perfect movie and a
landmark in filming history. 
The story centers around Ray Liotta and his entrance into the life of a
wise guy. From a young man picking up employer's cars to a fully blown
gangster. Him and his wife, Karen(Lorraine Bracco) start the marriage
well;life couldn't be better, but before long they're addicted to drugs and
on the run from cops.
Some up and coming actors used the movie as a stepping stone into a
successful star. You might remember a younger Samuel L Jackson in a very
short-but welcome-part.
In summary, the film is well cast, scripted successfully, and brilliantly
acted out. Rating=5/5
