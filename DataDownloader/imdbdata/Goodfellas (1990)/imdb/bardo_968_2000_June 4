Scorsese is unquestionably our greatest contemporary 
filmmaker. No one, with the exception perhaps of Kubrick,
can match his scope, depth, technical expertise, or 
sheer consistency. GoodFellas shows Scorsese at his 
best. The story is riveting, the performances; 
extraordinary, and the ending, although not a 
surprise, packs an enormous punch. What distinguishes 
it from the other great gangster films (Hawks' 
Scarface [and DePalma's],  Coppola's Godfather I &amp; II )
is not its  themes, but rather their depiction. Never 
before 
has a film so thoroughly captured the JOY, danger, 
and 
ultimately, the desperation of  &quot;Family&quot; life. One of 
the world's great films.
