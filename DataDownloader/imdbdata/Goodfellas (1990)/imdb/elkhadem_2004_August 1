The movie is an insight into mafia life. It shows you the different
characters a gangster could be rather than the &quot;so cool&quot; impression you
can get from a film like &quot;Analyze This&quot;. <br /><br />The performances are all excellent, but the movie lacks a solid plot -
there is no story to follow or anything to want you want to continue
watching. I basically kept watching to see if anything cool would
happen last minute or something.<br /><br />Not impressive at all, I am actually surprised it was on the list. I
would say, watch The God Father again or The Sopranos and don't waste
your time.
