This movie is what got me hooked on movies to begin with. To me it's the
greatest film ever made. So many excellent scenes. So many excellent
cameramovements. The voice-overs. The acting (i'd name a couple of good
performances but they're all just terrific). The score is also terrific.
It's the story of Henry Miller's rise and fall in the mob-world. The story
effortlessly unfolds into a shocking, sometimes even hilariously funny but
always compelling epic. It's a portrait of the crime-world in suburbia
during the 50s 60s and 70s and it is so plausible it came as no surprise to
me to learn it was based on a true story.
