Hey all movie lovers out there. This is my first visit on IMDb and I
like what I see. Iam a big fan of almost every movie genre there is,
you just cant say that one type of genre are all bad. Keep a open mind.
But of course there are good and lesser good movies . Goodfellas are
one of the best gangster/mafia films ever made, you got the best actors
,like Joe Pesci ,Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta. Ray did his best
performance ever. For me this movie just have a very mafia is feeling
surrounding the hole story. And we can all give Martin Scorsese the
full honor for that . Like in many other films. Eks.Casino. In
Goodfellas you have a lot of scenes that are so well played, you can
see the camera standing on one place all trough a scene,filming three
or four guys and still the realness don&#39;t disappear for one sec. They
make us believe it. That is damn good acting. So if you don&#39;t think
Goodfellas is a movie worth seeing, take a closer look. Leon Ya
