This is another one of those mafia gangster movies, and its on the top 250
for all time best?? It is way over rated. The acting is the core of all
movies, and it delivered, but the storyline was kinda off and towards the
end the movie just trails off with no real explanation to sum everything up,
but don't get me wrong it was a good movie, and they picked the right
director in that of Martin Scorsese and the starring roles, but something
was missing. There is just not much else to say after that if you want to
catch a better one this with replay value which also stars Robert De Niro
and Joe Pesci (who plays a similar character in Casino) check out Casino
which is under rated.
