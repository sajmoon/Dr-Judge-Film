I have to pick &quot;Goodfellas&quot; over &quot;The Godfather&quot; as my favorite crime
movie
of all time.  Tough it is a tough call, there is not a minute of boring or
wasted film in &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, whereas I think &quot;Godfather&quot; could make for a
snappier movie with 10-15 minutes worth of cuts in various places.  This
is
a fascinating ride through the criminal life of a boy who started out a
dreamer, and who made it to the big time.  Like &quot;The Decline &amp; Fall of the
Roman Empire,&quot; this masterful piece takes you through the life of a
would-be
gangster all the way to his disgraceful end as a government turnkey.  Ray
Liotta delivers the performance of a lifetime as the main character,
matched
equally by Lorraine Bracco as his supportive yet fearful wife.  The fact
that this movie is based on a true story only serves to pique interest
further.  This is a must see for any movie-goer and deserves its place
among
the top 100 movies of all time.
