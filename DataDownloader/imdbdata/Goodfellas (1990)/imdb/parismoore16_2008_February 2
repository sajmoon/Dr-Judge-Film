This movie makes you want to be a gangster! Its&#39;s a dark, harsh film
that actually manages to glorify gangsters. Director Martin Scorcese&#39;s
obsession for the characters and the extraordinary lives they lead is
truly demonstrated here.<br /><br />He shines throughout as he manages to entertain, and keep the audience
interested, for over two hours. The book might be better, but
&quot;GoodFellas&quot; is one Scorsese-De Niro collaboration in which De Niro is
often not the most important person on screen when he is on screen.
He&#39;s good, but Liotta is classic in the central role, a performance for
the ages in fact, while Pesci made for a deserved Oscar recipient with
the way he inhabits Tommy the walking Id and delivers &quot;GoodFellas&quot;
message of how the good life isn&#39;t all that good, that there&#39;s always
something rotten beneath the surface that will reach up and grab you at
the wrong time.<br /><br />This movie should have been Martin Scorsese&#39;s best director Oscar. His
directorial skills would never be better.
