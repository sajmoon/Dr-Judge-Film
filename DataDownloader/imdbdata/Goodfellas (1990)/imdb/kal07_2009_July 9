2009_July 9 
I will divide my review into following 5 categories each accounting a
maximum of 100%(if perfect)
________________________________________________________________ <br /><br />Visual Pleasure:[75%] This is a classic mobster movie. I&#x27;ve seen quite
a few mobster movies including all-time greats like Godfather 1,2; but
i&#x27;ve never been visually pleased with them. They are all smooth but
none of them visually stun me.<br /><br />Director&#x27;s Work:[100%] Martin Scorsese is a legend. I feel everything
he does is flawless. With this film again he has done an exceptional
job. Any director couldn&#x27;t have done anything more to make this film
better.<br /><br />Acting:[100%] This is the best part of the movie. Every actor fits into
his/her role perfectly. The execution and the dialogue delivery from
all the actors was truly remarkable.<br /><br />Entertainment Value:[71%] This is the thing that let me down. I wasn&#x27;t
fully entertained by this movie and this factor contributes a lot in my
rating. Sure there were some parts that I liked a lot but not as a
whole. Maybe people who love Gangster movies will like it a lot more
than I did.<br /><br />Script:[90%] The script was again very good. The narration and
screenplay was also impressive.<br /><br />__________________________________________________________________ <br /><br />My Advice: People who loved Godfather will love this one. Anyone out
there looking for a well-acted and a well-directed film, this one is
for you.<br /><br />_____ <br /><br />7.4/10
