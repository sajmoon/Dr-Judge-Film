&quot;As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a Gangster&quot;.
This classic line by Ray Liotta's character Henry Hill has been heard
numerous times, and it starts of Martin Scorsese's unforgettable
Gangster-movie &quot;GoodFellas&quot;...<br /><br />This film portrays the life of the mob in a way that (at the time) had
never been seen before. We follow Henry Hill who as a young kid watches
the way the gangsters in his neighborhood takes over the whole city and
rises to great power. He starts working for them, doing minor jobs. But
later he would become one of the most important persons in the whole
dynasty.<br /><br />What really has to be said about this film is that it's TOP
entertainment. I've watched &quot;GoodFellas&quot; about 5-6 times since I bought
it some years ago, and it's just as entertaining every time. The film
is so masterful at every point, that it's just a joy to watch. But
what's making Gangster-films like this so enjoying? If you think about
it...everybody wants to be a gangster. We all want the money, the
glamour and the power. Which guy wouldn't want to walk around, wearing
those shiny suits, getting all those women and doing WHATEVER he wants?
***Spoiler Following*** But then again...many of the well-known
Gangster-movies also shows the down-side of the gangster-life, and
doesn't exactly have an happy ending. This film is one of them. ***End
Of Spoiler***.<br /><br />When this film came, back in 1990, I'm sure it was breaking grounds.
Being a gangster has never looked better. Unlike the &quot;dead-serious&quot;
films people had seen earlier, this film had lots of charm and funny
gangster-humor. That's why it makes the gangster-life look so lovely.
Scorsese also shows us some of the coolest and most stylish
gangster-characters ever seen on film. And these characters are being
brought to us by actors like Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and
Paul Sorvino, who is all giving some terrific and unforgettable
performances. Pesci who won the Oscar Academy Award for Best Supporting
Actor, steals the show in about every scene where his character Tommy
DeVito is involved. A funny, short guy, with an even shorter temper,
that you'll never forget. De Niro is just as good as we know he can be,
in his role as the mob-veteran Jimmy Conway, and Paul Sorvino plays
Paul Cicero, the boss of the dynasty, in an absolutely convincing way.
The main-character Henry Hill is played by an impressive Ray Liotta,
which I have never seen better.<br /><br />&quot;GoodFellas&quot; is full of classic scenes and moments that you'll want to
watch over and over again. ***Spoilers Following*** The
restaurant-scene that introduces us to the grown-up Tommy for the first
time...&quot;How am I funny to you? Do I make you laugh, like a clown? Do I
amuse you?&quot;. Tommy's revenge when he gets embarrassed by Billy Batts,
and the scenes where he's picking on Spider...&quot;It was a good shot!&quot;.
***End Of Spoilers*** These are only a few of them. If I'm going to
complain about something in this film, then it's Lorraine Bracco in her
role as Henry's wife Karen. Don't get me wrong, she's doing a good
performance, but she doesn't convince me in EVERY scene she appears in.
And when actors like Liotta, Pesci and De Niro gleams in their roles,
she falls a little short in comparison.<br /><br />The directing is one of the best things in this film. Martin Scorsese
is an artist behind the camera, and he directs this film in a perfect
way. It's so exciting to watch this film, and I really like the scenes
where the camera smoothly flies through the restaurants, bars and so
on. And with Henry and Karen's voice-overs on top of it, it's all
perfection. And I'm not going to forget to mention the soundtrack.
Numerous great songs from the 60's and the 70's plays in the background
during the major part of the movie, and gives us the right feeling for
the setting of the film.<br /><br />I haven't seen &quot;Mean Streets&quot; (1973) yet, but if I'm going to pick out
the best film by Martin Scorsese, then it would stand between this one
and &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976). It's hard to choose since it's two very
different films. But both of them are classics, and films to be watched
over and over again. &quot;GoodFellas&quot; is a masterpiece, and in the
Gangster-genre it's only being topped by Italian director Sergio
Leone's &quot;Once Upon A Time In America&quot; (1984), in my opinion. If you
haven't seen it, then you sure is missing out one of the best
Gangster-flicks that you'll ever see. And if you've already seen it,
see it one more time and you'll probably consider it just as good and
entertaining as the last time you saw it!<br /><br />10 out of 10
