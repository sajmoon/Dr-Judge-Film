  Good fellas was directed by master director Martin Scorcese and is
probabaly his best.  It tells the story of an Irish-Italian protaginist,
Henry Hill, who starts out running errands for his friendly mafia neighbours
to becoming a made man.  It brings us through the traditional and exciting
avenues of an Italian crime syndicate from the the fifties to the eighties. 
The cast is also exceptional.  Ray Liotta plays the main character and his
close friend and mentor is played by Robert DeNiro, the definitive actor to
play a gangster.  The rest of the cast is filled with actors who play
mafiosos in many other crime movies.  The movie is really a story told in
the first person by the main character, Henry Hill, of the perks of being
involved in the mafia and the sudden betrayl and the self-centeredness that
the mob can entail.  <br /><br />  It's truly a great picture that should be seen by everybody whoo has any
interest in crime or crime dramas.  Superb!
