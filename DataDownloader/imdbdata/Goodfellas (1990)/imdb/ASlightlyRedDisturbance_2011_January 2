Goodfellas is another brilliant picture from Scorsese. It blends in
everything that makes a film great- entertaining scenarios, great
dialogue, and a lot of climactic resolutions. Both Ray Liotta and Joe
Pesci give incredible performances, and both veer into different types
of characters. This isn&#x27;t The Godfather in it&#x27;s tone. It is much more
energetic, more adrenaline-driven, and in a way more entertaining. De
Niro is always great to have, but as far as his performances go this
doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to his best. The story all around is strong,
although I wouldn&#x27;t call it anything ground-breaking as far as other
films of similar nature are concerned. But it does Scorsese&#x27;s
filmography proud.
