This film blows The Godfather saga out of the water! This is an excellent
film! The characters are way more interesting than The Godfather, in my
opinion. The story is about a young unmade associate to the New York Italian
Mafia, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) who tells his story from when he was twelve
to when he was about thirty something. His friends, and buddies are a much
older man Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro) and a about-the-same-age violent
mental midget Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci). He tells the story about the big
boss Paulie (Paul Sorvino) and his goomars and his wife Karen (Lorraine
Bracco - The Sopranos). The film is the second best Scorcese movie ever
made. The reason I loved it so much is it has great writing, directing and
acting. Other big stars are in it such as Sopranos stars Michael Imperioli,
Tony Sirico, Vincent Pastore, Tony Darrow and Pulp Fiction star Samuel L.
Jackson has a little but memorable part. Rent this movie,
today!
