What can I say?  The greatest film of the 1990's?  The best mob movie ever
made?  One of the best films ever made?  All these comments are equally
true.  The music, story, dialogue, acting, direction, camera work,
everything in this film is flawless.<br /><br />Ray Liotta will never give a better performance.  This is the kinda film
that will make you WANT to be a wiseguy.  This flick also captures the
purest essence of New York City.  New York is almost a character in the film
itself.  Brutally violent, hilarious, gut wrenching.  All these emotions add
up to one great movie, ya hear?
