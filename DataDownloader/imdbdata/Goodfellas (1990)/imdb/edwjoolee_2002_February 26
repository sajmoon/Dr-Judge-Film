When a movie this good comes along, I break down like a little child and
weep. What can I say, Martin Scorsesse is God. The way he employs the
visual
medium to spill his heart and soul is breathtaking. Goodfellas is THE
movie
about the Mafia,and criminals in general. As good as The Godfather trilogy
is, this movie, in my opinion, is much better.<br /><br />It's the little things in the film, like the way the characters banter and
joke with one another, the way they hang out in bars and restaurants, the
paroxysm of violence that occasionally mark their days, the way they
celebrate eachothers birthdays and weddings, etc..., that help place this
film way ahead of othersin its genre, including The Godfather 1 and 2.<br /><br />Martin Scorsesse does an excellent job of conveying the daily routine and
lives of these mobsters, portraying them as basically sad hoodlums, no
more
and no less. Their spiral downward seems all but inevitable.<br /><br />All of the cast in this film are excellent, especially Robert De Niro, Joe
Pesci and Ray Liotta. Fluid camerawork, masterful direction and great
music
are added to the mix to bring one, exhilarating piece of modern cinematic
masterpiece. 'Nuff said.<br /><br />
