Martin Scorsese delivers yet another fine example of film making at its
best. Goodfellas has all the elements of a great film: an entertaining
script, a talented cast and effective use of cinematic devices such as still
photography and voice-over narration. One of the highlights of Goodfellas is
the dialogue, with well-written narration (&quot;How could I go back to school
and pledge allegance to the flag and sit through good government bullshit?&quot;)
and rapid-fire conversations. The soundtrack is the finishing touch: it
creates a &quot;gangsta&quot; tone and makes the whole thing more
authentic.<br /><br />Goodfellas is arguably the best mob movie. I believe that it surpasses
Coppola's The Godfather because it is more entertaining, better written and
much of the acting (with the exception of Brando) surpasses performances in
The Godfather. Anyone who wants to be entertained or see an example of a
well-executed film with a good concept should see Goodfellas.
