Even though I've seen it a couple dozen times, I always get depressed when
it's over because I wish we could spend a few more hours w/these amazing
characters. <br /><br />As awesome a job as Costner did w/&quot;Dance With Wolves,&quot; it's too bad Scorcese
got no Oscars for this fine piece of work.<br /><br />No mob movie (or any movie) comes close to matching this masterpiece - not
even &quot;The Godfather.&quot; It's an absolute joke that Ray Liotta didn't get a
nomination for this. The then little-known actor commands your attention for
2 1/2 hours, even opposite legendary film heavyweights like De Niro and
Pesci.<br /><br />In a word - CLASSIC.
