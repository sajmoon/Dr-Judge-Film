a true classic film and one of the best acted films ever,Robert
DE&#39;Nero&#39;s acting was professional and just brilliant,Ray Liotta played
a brilliant part as henry hill.BUT for me the one that stole the show
really for me was Joe Pesci super acting by him as tommy and well
dersevered Oscar for is role in the film.<br /><br />the film is based on 30 years of the life Henry Hill,how he became a
mobster and how to save his own life ratted on his own friends and went
into police protection.<br /><br />The film has one of the best lines ever in-it which is the very first
line in the film &quot;AS FAR BACK AS I CAN REMEMBER I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A
GANGEST&quot; as soon as you hear that you know just what type of film your
wacthing.<br /><br />Also having ray&#39;s voice over most of the film telling the story was
brilliant.<br /><br />so all in all the best film ever made
