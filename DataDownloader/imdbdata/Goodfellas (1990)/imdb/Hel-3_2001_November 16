Since watching this film I've been hooked on watching gangster movies, from
'The Godfather' to 'A Bronx Tale'. All are good (and the Godfather is a
classic) but Goodfellas is my favourite. It is superbly cast, Deniro, Pesci
and Liotta are all equally brilliant, possibly pulling off the best
performance of their careers!<br /><br />'Goodfellas' depicts the true story of life in the Mafia through the eyes of
Henry Hill, originally told in the Book 'Wise Guys' by Nicholas Pileggi.
Scorese's portrayal of the story brings it to life and I highly recommend
it. 
If you are a fan of the gangster genre then 'Goodfellas' is not to be
missed.<br /><br />
