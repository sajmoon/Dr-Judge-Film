Thought I should finally see this movie last year because it is one of
those
movies &quot;you have to see&quot;.  Cinematography notwithstanding, I found little
to
draw me into the film.  I want to say that it has been dated, or perhaps
too
often imitated, but having just rewatched The Godfather I see what a good
mafia movie should be.  In a nutshell, the violence was expected, the
dialogue was simplistic, and the plot went nowhere fast.  I fought to stay
awake awaiting a huge climax that never happened.  But that is only my
opinion, and a lot of people seem to like it, so judge for
yourself.
