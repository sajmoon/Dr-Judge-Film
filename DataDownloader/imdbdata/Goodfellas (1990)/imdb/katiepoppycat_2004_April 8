2004_April 8 

After much hassle from the many people I know who love this film, I finally
gave in to peer pressure and watched it.  I've avoided it for a few reasons,
the main one being that the subject matter just doesn't appeal to me.  One
of the others being that of the few Scorsese films that I have seen, I
haven't liked the way he portrays women - they are usually whores, junkies
or generally corrupted sad creatures.  Of course, that's also true to a
certain extent of the men in his films.  I like a little more optimism in my
escapism.  Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this film. 
Yes, it glamourised what is essentially a repellant lifestyle, but it didn't
shy away from the nastier side - Henry's children witnessing the drug
fuelled screaming rows, and the damage to their marriage being a notable
one.  I had heard a lot about the violence in the film, but in today's
climate, it didn't seem all that shocking really.  Joe Pesci was
impressively scary, Robert De Niro brought out his stock character once
again - i really think he has to be one of the most overrated actors in
Hollywood,  He bores me rigid.  However, I did really like Ray Liotta,
although, a little like De Niro, he's now made a career out of that one
character.<br /><br />It's never going to make it into my top ten, but I will allow that it's a
pretty good film, and of course, that it was quite a moment in fim history.
