&quot;Goodfellas&quot; ranks on my list of the best movies of all time.  From the
director to the actors, nothing is out of place.  I've viewed almost every
film dealing with the mafia, and I'd have to say that this is one of the
best.  After watching this movie, I read the book &quot;Wiseguy&quot;, which the movie
is based on.  Like the movie, the book is incredible!  If you've seen the
movie, I strongly suggest that you read the book, you will appreciate the
movie even more.  Just a wonderful project on both the screen and on
paper!
