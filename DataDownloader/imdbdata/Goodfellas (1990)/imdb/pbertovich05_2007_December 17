Goodfellas is just one of those movies. It has everything from great
directing and acting to awesome music and memorable comic moments. In
this case, the directing is by Scorsese and the acting by Deniro, Pesci
and Liotta so its all superb. Throughout the movie you get the classic
comedy that comes along with Joe Pesci and Robert Deniro and some great
music to go along with all these great scenes. A lot of people claim
that the godfather is the greatest movie of all time. To me, watching
Goodfellas is just as engrossing but more fun to watch thanks to Pesci,
Deniro and Liotta. Goodfellas is just one of those movies that movie
critics can enjoy, but so can your average movie watcher.
