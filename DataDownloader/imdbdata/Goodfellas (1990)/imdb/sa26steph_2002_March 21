This film is the biz!
The first time I saw the night club 'funny guy' scene with Pesci and Liotta
a shiver went down my spine; this is one of the most memorable pieces of
acting I have ever witnessed.  The implied violence and sheer
unpredictability of Pesci's character is so convincing that you almost
forget you are watching a movie.  I would watch this film time and again.
The action skips along apace with the assistance of a narrative that is
sharp and witty and as usual Scorcese has assembled a memorable and
entirely
believable cast.
What more can I say - fantastic!
