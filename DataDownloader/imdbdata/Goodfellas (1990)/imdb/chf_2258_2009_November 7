I have no idea what that says about me, but, what the hell. <br /><br />I saw this back in 1990 and probably 15 more times since and I still
love it. I don&#x27;t think I fast-forward through any scene. I love
everything about it. Nothing seems far-fetched or implausible or
stupid. The dialogue seems real as well as these peoples&#x27; unfathomable
culture. To this day, I find myself quoting and thinking about this
movie. <br /><br />Here is a story about a kid who grows up NYC thinking that being a bad
guy ain&#x27;t that bad. Reminds me of someone who wants to be a rock star
except being a musician is legal. Henry Hill wanted money, women,
respect, and didn&#x27;t want to work too hard. It just so happens he ran
around with some guys who took themselves a bit too seriously.
Ultimately, the party (and the movie) had to stop and this guy&#x27;s demise
is just as entertaining as his rise to the &#x22;top&#x22;.<br /><br />If you love hearing that NYC Italian dialect and seeing what people
thought was fashionable back then you&#x27;ll enjoy this movie. Also, the
dichotomy of these crook&#x27;s lifestyle and their purported faith &#x26;
ethical code is portrayed enjoyably too.<br /><br />Thanks to the cast and crew. My new gangster film on heavy rotation is
The Departed and we will see if that one too withstands the test of
time.
