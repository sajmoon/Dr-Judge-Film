Another classic gangster movie,Goodfellas has a good ensemble cast,a
good storyline to it and great acting and sort of sets the mold for
future gangster movies such as Heat,The Departed and American
Gangster.Directed brilliantly by Martin Scorsese who should have
rightfully won Best Director for this movie,the movie tells the story
of Henry Hill(Ray Liotta) who joins the mob at a young age and meets
James&quot;Jimmy&quot; Conway(movie legend Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito(Joe
Pesci in his Oscar winning role) and is taken under the wing of
Paul&quot;Paulie&quot; Cicero(Paul Sorvino) who is a local mob boss.Also
nominated for the Best Picture Oscar as well as Best Supporting Actress
Oscar-Lorraine Bracco and Best Adapted Screenplay which Goodfellas
should have rightfully won all of those Oscars but won Best Supporting
Actor-Joe Pesci.Brilliant job by Martin Scorsese and the cast.A true
gangster classic.
