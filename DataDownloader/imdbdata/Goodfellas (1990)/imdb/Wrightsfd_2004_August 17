Every time I watch Goodfellas I have this undeniable urge to drink,
smoke, and swear like a sailer on leave. Or in this case like the
characters in Goodfellas. The movie tells the story of Henry Hill's
rise through the organized crime racket through the 1950s-1980s. While
it may be stylized and written for Hollywood the story it is based on
is true. Any guy that has not yet seen this movie can not call himself
a man. It is the quintessential guys movie, and Marty (as I like to
call him) has done a wonderful and subtle job of directing the
characters so they are outrageous without being over the top. This is a
movie that has great character development and a fantastic cast as well
as some of the best dialogue in film history.
