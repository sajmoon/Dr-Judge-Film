For someone like me who hasn&acute;t seen Francis Ford Coppola&acute;s
&quot;Godfather&quot;-trilogy &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is the ultimate movie about the mob!
Scorsese&acute;s work became so brilliant that repeated it with filming another
outstanding flick called &quot;Casino&quot;. And I&acute;m quite sure that the Dean
Martin-biography &quot;Dino&quot;, the next film Scorsese will be working on, has to
be placed into the same category. Even Robert de Niro wandered in the
footsteps of this great example with shooting his direction debut &quot;A Bronx
Tale&quot;. &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is one of the definite highlights of all persons
involved, even an actually average actor like Ray Liotta had the role of his
life time with this. Watch that film for a great Robert de Niro, a great
direction by Martin Scorsese, great supporting actors like Paul Sorvino,
Lorraine Bracco or Joe Pesci, a surprisingly good Ray Liotta and, of course,
the catching story. Did I forget anything? God forbid! A masterpiece!!!<br /><br />10/10<br /><br />
