GOODFELLAS (1990) **** Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, Lorraine
Bracco, Paul Sorvino, Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson.<br /><br />Martin Scorsese's blockbuster masterpiece based on the true-life story
of criminal Henry Hill. It begins in the 1950s as young Henry observes
the gangsters in his Little Italy neighborhood and longs to be one of
them. Theirs is the good life, Henry decides, with no hassles from
local cops because they're paid off and no grief from outsiders since
everyone is afraid of them. Besides, you can always get a good table at
the Copacabana or park in front of a fire hydrant and not worry about
getting a ticket. And there's always plenty of cash in your pocket. In
the film's early stages Henry gains our sympathy as he slowly
ingratiates himself among these neighborhood mobsters. He Gradually
climbs the ranks and eventually becomes one of them. <br /><br />Based on the book &quot;Wiseguy&quot;, by Nicholas Pileggi, the film offers a
first-person account of Mafia life, over 30 years. No one can watch a
Scorsese film without recognizing his visual style, and Goodfellas
represents a photographic tour of force even though cinematographer
Michael Ballhaus failed to garner an Academy nomination. Continually
moving, the camera never allows even the longer dialog scenes to grow
static. The scene that knocks your breath away occurs during the now
landmark Copacabana scene where Henry sweeps Karen past the waiting
line to enter the kitchen area past swiftly moving waiters into the
showroom just as Henry's private table is placed near the front in time
for Henny Youngman's act. Accomplished in one shot with a steadicam,
this scene mesmerizes the viewer just as much as Karen is swept up by
Henry's charms and show business connections.<br /><br />10/10- No finer film has ever been made about organized crime!
