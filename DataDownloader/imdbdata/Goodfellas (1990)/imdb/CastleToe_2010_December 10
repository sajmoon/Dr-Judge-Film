An enthusiastic adolescent stares longingly out of his bedroom window
at the gangsters hangout, dreaming to be a gangster... Bunks school,
works with them and eventually grows up to be one of them. This boy
narrating his story is half Irish, half Italian, New York based
mobster, Henry Hill(Ray Liotta). He is lashed by his father but he
complains to the mob bosses who help him out. His mother looks at him
in a suit and shrieks &#x22;You look like a gangster!&#x22; This scene marks his
transformation into a &#x22;WiseGuy&#x22;, one among the Goodfellas. How he grew
up surrounded by the mafia and worked and lived off them for 3 decades
forms the basis of this film.<br /><br />Based on the book &#x22;Wise Guy&#x22; by reporter Nicholas Pileggi (to whom the
real Henry Hill reportedly gave his true-life account), whose also
penned the screenplay with Director Scorsese, the 146 min movie
successfully packs 3 decades of mafia life without compromising on the
pace or the details, thanks to the brilliant direction of Martin
Scorsese and the editing(Thelma Schoonmaker).<br /><br />The beauty of this movie was it was full of violence, murder, theft,
smuggling, substance abuse, adultery, profanity and other unsocial
acts, all of which were spoken of very casually in the same breath with
no feeling of remorse or guilt. It delved deep into the subject of the
power of Mafia but it never advocated their use or glorified it.
Neither was it a typical moral bedtime story that are narrated to
children. This is effectively expressed by the gradual change in the
character of Hill&#x27;s wife, Karen Hill(Lorraine Bracco) through her
narration. She initially feels as uncomfortable as any outsider would
feel with the movie&#x27;s theme but slowly gets absorbed just as the viewer
into the mafia lives and in certain places, even makes you feel a
certain sympathy for the lead character and other people but leaves a
stranger taste when you realise that all their sufferings are well
deserved. They are casual with their criminal acts but deep down, they
know they are wrong. And as Roger Ebert said, they know they are
guilty, not because they did wrong but know that they want to do the
wrong again.<br /><br />The music &#x26; tempo(&#x22;Rags to Riches&#x22;, &#x22;Pretend you don&#x27;t see her&#x22; and so
on) seem hand picked for the occasions, perfectly echoing the mood of
the scenes. In addition to this, the screenplay of some scenes(which I
heard was mostly improvised by the actors, spot on) stand out for their
sense of sheer brutal-ism while some for their humour while some others
explaining a subtle point or thought or a transition in character.<br /><br />The acting cast comprising of Robert DeNiro(Jim Conway), Joe
Pesci(Tommy DeVito), Paulie Cicero(Paul Sorvino), Ray Liotta(Henry
Hill), Lorraine Bracco(Karen Hill) ...the list goes on....put an
earnest performance. We also have some interesting small-time roles
played by significant actors - Ed Stacks (Samuel Jackson), old
Vinnie(Martin&#x27;s father, Charles Scorsese), Tommy&#x27;s mother(Martin&#x27;s
mother, Catherine Scorsese), Diane(Kate Wallach, daughter of legendary
Eli Wallach of Good, Bad, Ugly fame) and so on...<br /><br />I admit to first seeing this movie in bits and parts(as I heard it was
one of Scorsese&#x27;s best) as and when it was telecast on Television and
wasn&#x27;t very impressed but decided to hold my view until later. But when
I got a chance to see it from start to end, I was impressed and
mesmerized by this piece of art.<br /><br />The primary goal of movie is to keep a viewer engaged through its
runtime and leave the viewer with a feeling of having experienced a
story which GoodFellas successfully does.<br /><br />So, here we have a gangster movie ranking (almost) equivalent to the
likes of Godfather.<br /><br />9 / 10<br /><br />(minus one, not because the movie was flawed, but as I respect the 10
stars for a once (or twice) in a lifetime movie - and I have chosen
Fight Club for now)
