The strange thing about me is that I only saw Goodfellas in the morning
and I had no idea that a film like this could blow me away. I started
watching it at twelve midnight and was expecting myself to fall asleep
but thankfully it didn&#x27;t because the story grips you and doesn&#x27;t let
go. For a movie that is two and a half hours long, it didn&#x27;t have any
boring bits and every scene was better than the last. The narration by
the main character is neat and I really like it how he explained his
life from the point he became a gangster all the way to the end. The
acting was superb by everyone, famous and not so famous, because they
just fitted comfortably in their roles. The actor who amazed me the
most was Joe Pesci mainly since his comedy makes you laugh out loud but
he also had a darker role as well. He played a gangster who would kill
if he was spoken to the way he didn&#x27;t like. Robert De Niro played the
calm but paranoid gangster who gave money to people because they opened
doors for him. Goodfellas is mainly about a boys life as he grows up
and turns into a gangster. Ray Liotta plays the role exceptionally well
but one thing that made me didn&#x27;t like him was his annoying laugh.
Martin Scorsese should have cut that part out and chucked into the lave
of Krakatoa. When the film finished at two thirty, I stayed still
digesting the film and was amazed by what had happened. It truly is a
treasure and every DVD collector should have it in their collection. A
film like Goodfellas perfectly explains a gangsters life, his marriage,
his family and kids, his friends, his sins and good deeds, to the point
where your brain is pouring out the information because it can&#x27;t stand
it. Goodfellas is the only film that has got a perfect ten from me in
the last six or seven months. A masterpiece! Kids and adults should
watch it (f*ck the rating system) and should definitely have a good
time watching the best film from Martin Scorsese. The sound and music
is very nice when a thrilling part comes on and it gives you a tingling
sensation. &#x22;As far back as I can remember, I&#x27;ve always wanted to be a
gangster.&#x22; -- Henry Hill, Brooklyn, N.Y. 1955, is the best line in film
history in my opinion. Ray Liotta says it like it was meant for him his
whole life.<br /><br />This film views the mob lives of three pivotal figures in the 1960&#x27;s
and 70&#x27;s New York. Henry Hill is a local boy turned gangster in a
neighborhood full of the roughest and toughest. Tommy Devito is a pure
bred gangster, who turns out to be Henry&#x27;s best friend. Jimmy Conway
puts the two of them together, and runs some of the biggest hijacks and
burglaries the town has ever seen. After an extended jail sentence,
Henry must sneak around the back of the local mob boss, Paulie Cicero,
to live the life of luxury he has always dreamed of. In the end, the
friends end up in a hell of a jam, and must do anything they can to
save each other, and stay alive. (copied from IMDb Page).<br /><br />Watching Goodfellas on Blu-Ray will making the viewing experience just
a tiny bit better. What can be better than watching this in high
definition? Eh, nothing! Why didn&#x27;t Goodfellas win more than one Oscar?
It should have won two more: one for best director and best picture.
