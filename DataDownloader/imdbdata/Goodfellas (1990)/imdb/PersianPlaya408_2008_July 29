This is Scorsese&#39;s masterpiece. Thought of by many as his best film
ever, i can see why. The film based on Pileggi&#39;s book about Henry Hill
(Liotta) and his buddies Jimmy Conway and Tommy De Vito&#39;s quest to move
up the mob hierarchy as they commit a robbery and then start to kill
people involved in it. Henry seems to be having a great time but is
affected negatively both in his personal and business life because of
his two lose cannon friends. Scorsese does a brilliant job adapting
this to the screen and produces one of the best directed and written
films ever with Goodfellas. With amazing cinematography from Michael
Ballhaus, and very good editing from Thelma Schoonmaker and James Y
Kwei, this film is a classic and one of my favorite films of all time.<br /><br />IMDb Rating: 8.8. My Rating: 10/10
