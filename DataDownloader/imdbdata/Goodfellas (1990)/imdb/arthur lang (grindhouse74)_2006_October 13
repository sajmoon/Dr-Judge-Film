I will try to keep this short &amp; sweet, cos so much praise has been put
on this film &amp; rightfully so, it&#39;s not just the best gangster film ever
made its probably the best film ever made period. Scorsese has created
a ground breaking visceral experience, everything is flawless the
pace,the use of music, the performances (Joe Pesci is the
standout),editing, the film looks &amp; feels great, the dialogue is
colourful, the violence is brutal &amp; you laugh when your supposed to.
The film opens with the song Rags to Riches by Tony Bennett &amp; closes
with Sid Vicious version of My Way, you realise that&#39;s what Scorsese
has done, made it his way. Even on a bad day he has few peers, &amp; when
so many crime films come &amp; go, Goodfellas will still be talked about
many years from now. Thanx Marty!
