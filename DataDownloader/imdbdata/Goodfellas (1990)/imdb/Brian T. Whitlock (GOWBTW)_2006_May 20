This is a true mob story, and as long as I could remember, this mobster
met his own downfall when double-cross went into the fray. These
Italian know how to have a good time. When Henry Hill(Ray Liotta)
decide to join the mob, he would get an offer he couldn&#39;t refuse. All
the racketeer, the murder, the mayhem, these Goodfellas are the ones
who could do it. They would make all these other gangsters look like
amateurs. My father would hang around these neighborhoods when he was
working for the NYPD. He encountered a mobster one and made it out
fine. Then drugs went into the fray, and the downfall begins. Joe
Pesci&#39;s character Tommy DeVito was such a potty-mouth, he kills a young
man for messing up, at the end, he gets his just desserts. Then Hill
rounds up the people he worked for. And in that courtroom, it was in
your face action. A great movie, highly compelling, and it would be
great to hear more from my father, he&#39;s been there! In the 1970&#39;s that
is. Rating 5 stars.
