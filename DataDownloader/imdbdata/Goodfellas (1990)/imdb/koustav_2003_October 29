The movie showcases deniro and liotta at their best, with pesci acting in
his usual gangster role. However the film is too long, without a tight
plot
for support. hence after watching for two hours, one starts wondering when
the film is going to get over. while the film has some very funny and
quite
believable scenes, it ends up being another one of scorcese's film
glamorising gangsterhood.
