HOW IS THIS MOVIE IN FRONT OF THE MATRIX ON THE TOP 250?<br /><br />This movie is the worst ever, and the Matrix was the best ever! This movie
was simply pathetic!<br /><br />Just because Robert Deneiro was in this movie doesn't mean that it's good.
Just because he was good in other movies does not mean he was good in this
one. This was just not a part for him. And Martin Scorsese really screwed. I
just can't express how much of a dissapointment this was, and how much of a
dissapointment it was seeing it rated so high.<br /><br />Do not see this movie. Give it a 1 on the rating.
