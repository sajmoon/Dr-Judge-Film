Scorsese&#x27;s &#x27;Goodfellas&#x27;, Based on the non-fiction book Wiseguy by
Nicholas Pileggi, is one of the most riveting biopics to have hit the
Silver Screen. The film follows the rise and fall of three gangsters,
spanning three decades, which grows onto, and becomes a dazzling
experience, overall.<br /><br />&#x27;Goodfellas&#x27; keeps you engrossed in those 136-minutes, it makes you
feel the decades it&#x27;s past. It&#x27;s a fantastic film, it&#x27;s special because
the legendary &#x22;F&#x22; word is used approximately 300 times, now that&#x27;s
truly something. <br /><br />Scorsese&#x27;s direction and execution to the material, is, as always,
brilliant. The Cult Filmmaker can never be doubted, as simple as that.
Nicholas Pileggi&#x27;s screenplay is perfect, he knew the subject more than

is flawless, yet again. Lorraine Bracco is very sincere; very good.
Others are satisfactory.<br /><br />A must watch movie... Two Big Thumbs Up!
