Scorsese defines his brilliance with this movie. Goodfellas is one of the
top films of the 1990's and has stood the test of time. The performances
of
Liotta and De Niro are sensational but Joe Pesci is the one that really
stands out. His role as the short-tempered accomplice is portrayed
flawlessly and he really becomes the character. The story by Nicholas
Pileggi is topnotch and the action is intense. A wonderful piece of
cinema!<br /><br />My rating : @@@@ 1/2 (out of five)
