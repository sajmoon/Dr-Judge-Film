1999_March 26 

First let me just say that GOODFELLAS is not only the best of its genre, but
also my favorite movie overall. I've seen it about over a dozen times and
can never get enough of it. Martin Scorsese is a master at telling Nicholas
Pileggi's true-story novel about Henry Hill, a man who grew up in a Mafia
family only to sell them out in the end.<br /><br />Secondly, the acting in this movie is equal to the story and direction, its
superb! Robert DeNiro is excellent in a secondary role as the ruthless
Irishman Jimmy, who's character I might add is up for parole in about 15
years. Ray Liotta is also very impressive as Henry, and I can't forget Joe
Pesci who pretty much stole the spot as the insane/psycho
Tommy.<br /><br />Lastly, I just wanna speak a little on the film overall. It in no way tries
to whitewash the mafia scene like the GODFATHER movies, rather it gives you
a look inside, at its rawest. The scenes of violence in this movie will blow
you away and they give the movie a strong sense of realism. By far Martin
Scorsese's best film to date, combining great actors, a story that will
definitely keep you watching &gt; loved the voiceovers,
and probably one of the best depiction of real-events I've ever seen on
film. CASINO is also highly recommened!
