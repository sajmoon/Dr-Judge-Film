Goodfellas, although somewhat exaggerated in a few situations, follows
pretty closely, the life and uncertain times of the half Irish half
Italian wannabe wise-guy, Henry Hill. From his teenage years running
errands for the neighborhood Mafioso&#39;s while rising through the ranks
by hijacking truckloads of cigarettes, to him being on top of his
limited but somewhat powerful mob world, to the deepest part of a
cocaine addiction and digging shallow graves to bury a not dead body
that was in the trunk of his car. All in all, this depiction of the
wise-guy lifestyle, along with the actions taken by these men in order
to carry on with this lifestyle, is done in a way that has oft been
imitated but never duplicated. A wonderful story, made into a superb
film.
