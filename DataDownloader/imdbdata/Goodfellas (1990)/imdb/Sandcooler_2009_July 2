This is one of those movies that&#x27;s pretty much nothing but classic
scenes. Thinking about &#x22;Goodfellas&#x22; is essentially re-imagining the
entire movie, usually starting of with Joe Pesci. Pesci&#x27;s is by far the
most threatening character in this movie, and the atmosphere gets
really tensed when someone gets in his way somehow. He doesn&#x27;t want to
be pushed, and you don&#x27;t want him to be pushed. The scene where he asks
what makes him funny is one of the most uncomfortable moments ever
caught on film. This movie often feels uncomfortable in fact. Whenever
any secondary character is involved in a conversation, you know
something will go wrong. The shady background characters in this movie
really drop like flies, this movie has an incredible amount of raw
violence and ice cold death scenes. Even by the standards of a classic
crime movie, this movie just feels really harsh and unpleasant. Which
doesn&#x27;t make it any less entertaining, by the way, this movie really
knows when to move on. I&#x27;m not going as far as calling this the best
gangster film ever made, but it&#x27;s up there.
