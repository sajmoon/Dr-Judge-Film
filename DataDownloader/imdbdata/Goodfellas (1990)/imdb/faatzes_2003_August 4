I don't know where the f*ck have i been all my life??? I saw the film 13
years after it came out....but still i LOVED it, especially the
cast.
I was sure, even before i saw the movie, that DeNiro is going to be great
(he always is), and i'm a big fan of Liotta too. Who struck me the most
was
Pesci. He played out his role f*cking perfectly...by far his best work.
And
also Bracco - just SUPER!!!<br /><br />so anyone who has not seen it yet......u don't know what you're
missing
