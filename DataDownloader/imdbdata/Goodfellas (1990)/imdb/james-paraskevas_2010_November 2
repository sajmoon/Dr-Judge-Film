This is a perfect movie.<br /><br />It all came together for Scorsese, a true magician of cinema.<br /><br />After brilliant films such as Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, the acting
performances, soundtrack, suspense, comedy, violence, setting, were all
interwoven to a tee.<br /><br />Liotta must deserve credit, carrying the film the whole way. But there
were also mentionable acting performances from his wife (Karen), Mori,
and Pauli Cicero.<br /><br />De Niro in my opinion is one of the greatest actors in cinematic
history, and Joe Pesci you can&#x27;t go wrong with in any movie centered
around violence/the mafia/blood/humour.<br /><br />10/10 A must watch for ANYONE.
