1999_April 12 

This movie is nothing but 3hours of voice-over.It just goes on and on,it
never stops. This really has got to be one of the worst American gangster
movies ever made.Go watch SCARFACE,THE GODFATHER1,2.,they're million times
better.And anyway SCORSESE is yesterday's man,when GOODFELLAS was made JOHN
WOO made THE KILLER which is completely groundbreaking whereas everything
that happens in GOODFELLAS we've seen before in ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA
and THE GODFATHER1,2.So don't waste time watching this garbage when you can
watch SCARFACE.GOODFELLAS IS BORING BORING BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
