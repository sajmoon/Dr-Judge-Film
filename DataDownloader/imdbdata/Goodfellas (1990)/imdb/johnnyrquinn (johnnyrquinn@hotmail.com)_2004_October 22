Mine is a question and not a comment - does anyone know which band did
the music during the scenes at the end when Henry is being followed by
the (police)helicopters, you know the scenes where he is driving back
and forth picking his brother up etc. I am not referring to the
Stones(Monkey Man) or Clapton(Layla), it leads off with the bass as
Henry starts off in the car and his first sighting of the copters.<br /><br />I have been asking friends etc for the last number of years and made
half hearted attempts to find out.<br /><br />Nobody seems to know for sure, I would appreciate it if someone has the
name of the band and the album.<br /><br />Cheers.
