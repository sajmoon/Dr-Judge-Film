Think back: has Scorsese ever made a good film in his life? No, he
hasn&#39;t. You don&#39;t even need to think about that one. Does anyone ever
wonder why Scorsese has never won an Oscar? It&#39;s because the movies he
makes are terrible. End of story. In this train-wreck of a film,
Scorsese has the actors bumble across the screen for 2 and a half hours
muttering in God-awful &quot;Italian&quot; accents. Scorsese probably thought he
could capture the brilliance of the Godfather trilogy when he made this
film. To say the least, he failed miserably. I pity those who consider
Goodfellas a classic. This film is FAR from it. So if you rent this
movie, anticipating 2.5 hours of entertainment, approach with caution.
