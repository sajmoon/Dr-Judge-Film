I overreacted in saying that Casino was better than Goodfellas, that is
not
true. I just said that cause I heard people writing bad stuff about
Casino
and I didnt like that. They are both equally excellent. now I know why
people say they are similar because they are both adapted screenplays
from
books with the same author. But it is two completely different places
that
they take place in.<br /><br />Goodfellas has a bunch of excellent performances. Joe Pesci is fantastic
as
a bad ass. Robert De Niro was also great, Liotta wasnt bad but he was
overshadowed by the other two. Lorraine Braccos performance I think is
overrated. This movie has a very well written script and deserved to win.
Scorseses Direction is very well down in this movie.<br /><br />Now I think Scorsese should have won Best Director for this but the
academy
thought different. Now hes gonna win for Gangs of New York which is crap
compared to Goodfellas. He will win for GONY cause they passed up the
oppurtunity on Goodfellas and Raging Bull. Scorsese should have also at
least be nominated for Best Director for Casino. Now he will win for a
movie
that doesnt deserve it.
