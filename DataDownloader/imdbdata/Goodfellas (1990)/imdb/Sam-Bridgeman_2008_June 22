I first watched GoodFellas about 2 years ago and the moment I saw the
murder of Billy Batts within the opening couple of minutes I knew I was
in for a treat. Robert De Niro plays Jimmy &quot;The Gent&quot; Conway
brilliantly. Joe Pesci also superbly plays the ruthless Tommy DeVito.
In my opinion I think it is Martin Scorsese&#39;s best film. Im a big fan
of Scorsese&#39;s choice of music to put in GoodFellas as I am a big fan of
Eric Clapton, Cream &amp; The Rolling Stones. Since I watched GoodFellas I
have gone on to buy other Scorsese films such as Raging Bull, Casino,
Taxi Driver &amp; Gangs Of New York, But still without a doubt I think
GoodFellas is better than all of those.
