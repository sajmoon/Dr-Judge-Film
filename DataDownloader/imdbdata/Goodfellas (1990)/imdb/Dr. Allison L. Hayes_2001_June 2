What a film!  You have the trinity of Scorsese, DeNiro, and Pesci at top
form.  Ray Liotta is a favorite who deserves more of these kinds of roles.
Lorraine Bracco is divine--esp. in the &quot;you stood me up&quot; scene.  Then,
there
is Catherine Scorsese, Martin Scorsese's mother, who ad libbed her part.
She was a natural--absolute perfection.  I love DeNiro and Paul Sorvino.
And I always wonder what is Joe Pesci like in real life!  Note the &quot;how am
I
funny scene.&quot;  Funny how to the trinity they are Bobby, Marty, and
Joey--something tells me that is not the case with us mere mortals.
SUPERB.
