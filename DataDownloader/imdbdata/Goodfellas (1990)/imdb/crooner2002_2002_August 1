12 years on this still remains the ultimate film. Black humour, blacker
violence, fantastic performances, this film has it all, although if you
dont
know that by now there's something wrong.<br /><br />DeNiro, Pesci and Ray Liotta (what the hell he did with his career after
this is anyones guess) are all fantastic as are Paul Sorvino and Lorraine
Bracco.<br /><br />I must have seen this about twenty times and still find something new each
time. I can't recommend it enough
