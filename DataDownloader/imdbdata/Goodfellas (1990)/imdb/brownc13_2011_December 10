Goodfellas (1990) Cast Robert De Niro as James (Jimmy) Conway<br /><br />Ray Liotta as Henry Hill<br /><br />Joe Pesci as Tommy Devito<br /><br />Lorainne Bracco as Karen Hill<br /><br />Paul Sorvino as Paul Cicero<br /><br />Frank Sivero as Frank Carbone<br /><br />Tony Darrow as Sunny Bunz<br /><br />Mike Star as Frenchy<br /><br />Frank Vincent as Billy Batts<br /><br />Goodfellas is a biography of Henry Hill a gangster or more like a crook
with mob ties who finds his way as a kid into organized criminal
lifestyle. The plot of this film is based around power, money &#x26; greed
which would in all likely hood is the down fall of the main character
in this film, including Henry himself. <br /><br />Jimmy (Robert De Niro) would be a gangster that Henry looked up to. He
liked jimmy style, in fact throughout the film you will see Henry dress
like him and even begin to enter the rooms as he did commanding
respect, flashing cash, a sort of Mans man attitude.<br /><br />Paulie (Paul Sorvino) on the other hand never actually did anything in
the film be was feared by the gangsters alike. You never see Paulie get
his hand dirty yet he does wind up in prison just as the others do.<br /><br />Tommy (Joe Pesci) was a lunatic, who not only did dirt but found it
enjoyable, didn&#x27;t blink an eye at killing someone for almost anything,
a total out of control enforcer.<br /><br />These guys will be the guys Henry would have as his role models the
editing and narration of the film made it a really good biopic. Editing
was done as an inside out technique, it would show action happening
then it would back up to explain how and why? Directed by Martin
Scorsese who has done such films as The Departed &#x26; newly Shutter Island
this film won a slew of accolades&#x27;. Including 2 Oscars, a truly
incredible portrayal of a true life event. Written by Nicholas Pileggi
in which the screen play was based on his book &#x22;Wise Guy&#x22;. He also did
another biography film known as Casino, another gangster base film.
Directed by Martin Scorsese again. Sound quality would be different for
both. In Goodfellas it would use Dolby Surround sound but in Casino DTS
stereo quality was used.<br /><br />Lighting techniques were kind of dark, but gave a really good feel for
secrecy, and confidential meetings, it came across well in the film. I
would rate this feel as a must see film.
