This movie works so well as an intriguing look into the world of the mob and
is filled with many great performances and dialogue.  I think it's also
worth pointing out that Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci worked so very well
together here and they seemed to have a lot of fun making this movie. 
Highly recommended to anyone who wants to see a good gangster
movie.
