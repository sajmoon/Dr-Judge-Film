This is truly one of those movies that pull you into it and have you
engrossed in it from beginning to end. The acting is superior and each
the casting choices could not have been better made.<br /><br />This movie combines dark humor along with the cruel reality of what it
is really like living in the world of the Mafia. What makes this movie
even more riveting, is that fact that it is completely true. In fact,
some of the actors in the movie play themselves such as some of the law
enforcement people.<br /><br />If you want to know what being in the Mafia is REALLY like, then this
is the movie you should watch. Joe Pesci plays one of the lead
characters, who is outrageously funny and entertaining, and just when
you start to think you might like and understand him, he pulls you back
to the reality that he is a cold hearted murderer who can Kiss his
mother on the way to savagely kill someone.<br /><br />Do not miss this movie, which is guaranteed to leave you being grateful
about having such a simple life.
