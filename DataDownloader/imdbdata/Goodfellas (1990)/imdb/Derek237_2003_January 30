Goodfellas is an all around great movie. If you don't immediately love
it, it'll probably grow on you soon enough. Ray Liotta, Lorraine
Bracco, and Joe Pesci all give the best performances in their careers
and it is arguably Martin Scorsese's best directorial effort. Sure,
it's up there among his best with Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, and Raging
Bull, but this one just stands out more. I think what makes Goodfellas
so great is it's compilation of elements like the acting, storytelling,
character development, and dialogue. My One complaint is that Robert
DeNiro is not in the movie as much as you'd expect, and I was always
left wanting more. But maybe that's a good thing.<br /><br />Goodfellas is an amazing, unforgettable film that everyone should see.
If you haven't already had the pleasure of seeing it, go rent it right
now. It could just change your life.<br /><br />My Rating: 10/10
