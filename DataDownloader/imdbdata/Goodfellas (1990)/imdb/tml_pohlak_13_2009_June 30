To be frank, &#x22;Goodfellas&#x22; is probably the best crime movie ever made.
It is more than just a movie; it tells a captivating tale; it is
perfectly cast; Scorsese&#x27;s direction is at its utmost brilliance. In
fact, I&#x27;d venture to say that &#x22;Goodfellas&#x22; far surpasses what Francis
Ford Coppola&#x27;s much-loved &#x22;The Godfather&#x22; has to offer.<br /><br />In the first place, the entire sympathy for the characters of &#x22;The
Godfather&#x22; depended on portraying them more as a dysfunctional family.
This is not what a crime film should be. A crime film should be about
*crime*, not men in tight suits pledging loyalty to each other. The
characters of &#x22;Goodfellas&#x22; are, above all, gangsters. As a matter of
fact, one of the very first lines is &#x22;As far back as I can remember, I
always wanted to be a gangster&#x22;. At the same time, however, Martin
Scorsese does not glorify violence. He does not overemphasize blood
spattering or disturbing death sequences. The violence here is
realistic, precisely because it&#x27;s cold, cruel, and emotionless. As a
result, this film is one of the more realistic, plausible, and
believable crime films out there.<br /><br />Another thing that is better about &#x22;Goodfellas&#x22; is its length, 146
minutes compared to &#x22;The Godfather&#x22;&#x27;s 175. That might not seem like
much at first, but think about it. That&#x27;s just short of a half-hour.
&#x22;The Godfather&#x22;, as is, could&#x27;ve easily been trimmed down by an hour.
That can&#x27;t be said about &#x22;Goodfellas&#x22;. Things just happen in the film;
it&#x27;s interesting all the way, even during its more contemplative parts.
Additionally, the characters of &#x22;Goodfellas&#x22; are really compelling, but
I will avoid going in-depth here.<br /><br />Martin Scorsese is, as I&#x27;ve mentioned, at the top of his game when
directing &#x22;Goodfellas&#x22;. One particular shot near the end stands out.
Scorsese makes use of the (as I like to call it) &#x22;Vertigo effect&#x22; (ie
zooming in while tracking backwards; the characters in the foreground
remain approx. the same size while there is a significant shift in the
background). This shot has been overused to the point of becoming
clich&#xE9;, yet it works effectively here. This is just one instance of
Scorsese&#x27;s fantastic work on this film. He constantly keeps the
audience engaged in the film and the characters. In the blink of an
eye, a scene can shift from comedic to horrific. Yet such transitions
never seem jarring or awkwardly paced.<br /><br />One more thought about the film: the upbeat soundtrack that accompanies
&#x22;Goodfellas&#x22; is actually really well pulled off. Whenever a song plays,
it fits in perfectly with the action, both in melody and lyrics.<br /><br />The Verdict: This is what a crime film should be all about: realistic,
entertaining, gripping. &#x22;Goodfellas&#x22; is just about flawless.<br /><br />Overall Rating: 10/10
