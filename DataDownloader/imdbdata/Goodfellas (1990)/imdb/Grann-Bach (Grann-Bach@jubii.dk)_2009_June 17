2009_June 17 
This review is based on the 2-Disc Special Edition release. I haven&#x27;t
read the novel, nor do I know anything about Hill that this film didn&#x27;t
tell me, but I understand that that this is a faithful adaptation, and
that both give an honest recounting of his life. This can perhaps best
be described as a portrayal of the environment, showing good and bad
alike. The glamorous nature of that way of life is put up on the
screen, and you definitely understand its appeal. Scorsese doesn&#x27;t fail
us for a second of this. It is brutal, funny, charming, bloody, intense
and entertaining. The writing is excellent. Narration as well as dialog
are incredible and highly memorable and quotable. The plot is
interesting and develops nicely. Strong storytelling is one of the
things that keeps you watching. The characters and personalities is
another. Cinematography and editing are top-notch. The scoring is
spot-on, with every music piece being fantastic and fitting(directly or
ironically) at the same time. Every single acting performance is
perfect, not only Liotta, Pesci and of course DeNiro. The pacing is
marvelous. Mood and atmosphere are established masterfully. The
language doesn&#x27;t hold back, neither in tone nor in amount. There is
some sexuality, not terribly graphic. Violence is unrestrained. This
has disturbing content. The DVD comes with four featurettes(coming to
about an hour in running time, all put together), as well as two
commentary tracks... &#x22;Cast and Crew&#x22;(self-explanatory) and &#x22;Cop and
Crook&#x22;(the actual Henry, and one of the feds who worked against the
mob). All of it is worth the time. I recommend this to fans of gangster
movies and/or authentic, biographical ones. Just make sure you can
handle it. 10/10
