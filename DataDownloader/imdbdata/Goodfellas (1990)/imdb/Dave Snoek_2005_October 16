Watching Goodfellas is a rare experience. The characters, their
lifestyle and tone of the film suck you in and will not let you go. <br /><br />Goodfellas contains flawless acting with Ray Liotta who shines as the
shy, modest gangster who doesn't really fit in between the ball
breaking tough guys. His performance is outrageous yet subtle. Like Joe
Carnahan said: Ray Liotta can say more with one look in his eyes than
other actors can with a 5 minute monologue. Joe Pesci is hilarious and
very disturbing as the aggressive Tommy DeVito. He is like a ticking
timebom without display; you can't predict when he's going to explode.
Robert DeNiro is scary but likable as Jimmy Conway and the other actors
like Paul Sorvino are excellent and really contribute to the overall
feel of the film.<br /><br />Goodfellas truly delivers on every aspect of film-making; acting,
soundtrack (with ''Layla'' and ''Sunshine of your love'' being the most
memorable) editing (The chaos that Henry goes through on his last day
as a wiseguy is one of the best edited scenes ever)<br /><br />Highly recommended.
