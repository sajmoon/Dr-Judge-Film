2003_July 9 

Watching this good movie, you feel like watching the Sopranos,moving from
one casual killing to another, with an italian family meal or
two.
Scorsese is so clever you're not bored any minute : situations are funny,
suspense is there, both characters and actors are good.
But you cannot go as far as liking the &quot;hero&quot; or feeling anything for him
except a mild sympathy.
so, all in all I give this movie a 7 mark but do not really understand
its
ranking, except if some have mistaken it for the godfather...
