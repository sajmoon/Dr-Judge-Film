This is a true masterpiece, storyline if brilliant and so is the acting,
kickass story build-up and an amazing ending which will shock you, should
have been called bad guys instead but what you gonna do , goodfellas sounds
pretty cool too, de niro as usual a brilliant performance, and joe pesci is
so funny, gets a bit annoying but that is just my opinion, if someone sees
this movie and doesn't like it, there is something really wrong with
you.
