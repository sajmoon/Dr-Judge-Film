Stylish, noirish, &quot;reality&quot; movie is a blunt rush of cinematography that
makes you giddy. Beyond the genius adaptation of Nick Pileggi's tell-all,
&quot;True Crime&quot; book, you have enormous performances by almost everyone in the
film. Ray Liotta is off the chart as Henry Hill, Pesci is extremely
disturbing as Tommy, DeNiro is insanely good as Jimmy, Paul Sorvino was
never better and Lorraine Bracco's turn as Karen sends the whole project
into overdrive. The small things, like Tommy's mother's paintings and the
crew's discussion of the boat painting bring a demented light to the movie
which frankly has not been attained in any other movie. Improves with
frequent viewing.
