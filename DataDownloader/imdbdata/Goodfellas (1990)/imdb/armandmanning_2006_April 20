2006_April 20 
I feel about this movie the way I feel about all Scorcese films; my one
controversial contention is that they lack heart. They are so well
executed, virtuosic, precise, controlled, and at the same time, a
little exuberant. Still, they lack heart. Have you ever seen deep parts
of yourself in his characters or in his worlds, have you ever
recognized, as one might, in the look of a Wes Anderson film, or even
in the playful inventiveness of Back to the Future, a world that feels
new and familiar at the same time, particular and general, some world
or situation or feeling that you feel has been in you forever though
you&#39;re only recognizing it now. Do you feel deeply about any of them?
Simply put, do they move you? Perhaps an answer of &#39;No&#39; to these
questions does not indicate a deficiency. But out of the best works of
art I want that phenomenon of meeting myself in something separate from
me, a new and yet familiar part of myself, that sense of expansion,
that presentiment of a mysterious and universal beauty. Given that,
though, I do not hesitate to say that Scorcese&#39;s films are compelling,
and furthermore, that Goodfellas ranks high among them. I am involved
in its story easily and always when I run across it on TV. Just
remembering the cocaine helicopter pasta sauce sequence makes me think
well of the movie.
