1999_April 27 

I love the combination of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro, but when
you throw Joe Pesci in the mix, you have what I call cinematic magic.  It
is
one of, if not the best movie of the decade and the performances are
simply
unforgettable.  Joe Pesci earned the Oscar by playing a role only he could
play.  The direction of Martin Scorsese, is simply wonderful making this
movie one of my ten best.  Only in &quot;The Godfather&quot;  made me want to join
the
mob more.  Its by far a 10 of 10 and a brilliant movie.
