Goodfellas, well, perhaps one of the best movies ever made. It holds a
serene sense of the life of the modern gangster in ways that movies
like Godfather - although i enjoy it intensly- are not able to do. Even
like henry hill says in the movie, &quot;there were no curses like you see
in the movies, your killers came to you with smiles.&quot; we are getting a
fact based movie which is hard to believe, but is true. The book
Wiseguy, which GoodFellas comes from, is nearly identical to the movie.
We aren&#39;t getting a novel like in Puzzos godfather but an actual
account of the mafia in America and its done masterfully. Who can deny
the Copacabana shots....its just great....to go for several minutes
with such intricate cinematics is wonderful and unlike other movies
which do this with special effects shots, we get an intense and moving
moment with only the characters. It is just wonderful. The movie is
Gatsby gone arwy and if nothing else, a masterpiece of American cinema
