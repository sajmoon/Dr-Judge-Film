Martin Scorsese delivers the ultimate gangster flick, and
his
argueably finest movie ever. Complete with an ensemble cast
consisting of Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, and
Lorraine
Bracco, the actors leave no stone unturned as they play
their
parts with a lot of heart and soul, as if it would be the
big-
gest roles of their lives.
&quot;Goodfellas&quot; is a film about the 30-year exploits of a
young
New York kid named Henry (Liotta), who becomes infatuated
with
mob life when he is &quot;adopted&quot; by a mafia family. Soon,
Henry
and his two best buds Jimmy (DeNiro in his most sadistic
role
ever!) and Tommy (Pesci, whose delightfully evil here),
paint
the town red and cause chaos towards rival hoods. Henry
later
marries a local girl named Karen (Bracco), who seems like
putty in Henry's hands, but becomes shocked when she discovers
her husband's true colors with the mafia.
With tension filled scenes and a gripping script which is
narr-
ated by the 3 leads, (a concept used in another brilliant
Scor-
sese flick &quot;Casino&quot;) the viewer will feel every bit of the
heat
that is simmered by the cast and atmosphere. Plus, a lively
soundtrack consisting of rock music and old Italian love
songs
make the movie more enjoyable to the viewer. The only flaws
that might make the viewer cringe are the slightly grim
vio-
lence (check out the beginning of the movie. Whew!), and the
total running time of the movie, which runs at least more
than
an hour and a half. But other than that, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is a
prime crime thriller, not to be missed!
