You forget just how good Goodfellas is, its one of those films you<br /><br />must watch at least 3 times a year, and despite owning it on every format
its available on, you still sit through it when its on telly!<br /><br />( or is that just me?)
 I remember not being allowed to watch this when it first came out, my Dad
and older brother were watching it, and I walked in the room right when
Billy Batts was being murdered, it stuck in my head ever
since.
 This is at times frightening, shocking, funny, moving, films just don't get
any better than Goodfellas.
 Despite only being twelve years old, it remains an all time
great,
Ray Liotta puts in the best performance  of his career, and its hard to take
when you see him turning up in films like Operation Dumbo
Drop!
Robert De Niro is on his usual fine form,what can you say about Joe Pesci? I
had to watch home alone just to convince myself he is not
evil!
 The viewer is totally gripped from the minute the film starts, its a roller
coaster of a movie, I found myself as a first time viewer being glad I was
just watching fromthe comfort of my sofa, because these are the last people
you'd want to upset, they really are that believable.
I think the whole 'wise guy' persona is possibly the most frightening film
character of all time, possibly because its non fictional,<br /><br />but Id rather be locked in a cage with a lion than take on Joe Pesci as
Tommy De Vito!
