Just how Martin Scorsese - arguably one of the most influential directors
of
modern cinema - has been overlooked for the Best Director Oscar after over
thirty years of filmmaking is beyond me.
Seminal films such as 'Taxi Driver' (1976) and 'Raging Bull' (1980) - both
notorious, whether justified or not, for their visceral violence - have
done
more than enough to seal Scorsese's reputation as an acclaimed storyteller
and 'Goodfellas' (1990) continues in this tradition.
With an opening line of narrated dialogue that any scriptwriter would have
loved to have committed to paper (Martin Scorsese co scripted the film),
and
one destined to be quoted for years to come, the film follows three
decades
in the life of Henry Hill, an Irish Sicilian who grows up truly under the
influence and instruction of the 'family'.
As with others of this genre, all the common themes of the Italian
mob-scene
are there: the loyalty, the respect, the violence, the eventual, some
would
say inevitable, downfalls and consequences of a life of crime, but
ultimately where 'Goodfellas' differs and succeeds compared with the
multitude of other Gangster films is its basis in truth - the life and
times
of a man as he graduates through the ranks and learns his
trade.
But one of the most important rules of the mafia is don't bite the hand
that
feeds, and as Henry finds out, a betrayal of Paulie, the man responsible
for
the life he leads, has disturbing and lasting effects.
An aspect that really sets 'Goodfellas' apart is the portrayal of
characters
by a cast all on top form. Ray Liotta has never been better than as Henry,
a
Goodfella with a reasonable streak, and the ease at which Robert De Niro
portrays the calculating Jimmy is frightening - its almost second nature.
Joe Peschi, like De Niro a Scorsese favourite, acts as the heart of the
film
as the dynamic Tommy - a man all too willing to shoot and maim anyone who
dares to cross him. Finally Paul Sorvino as Paulie offers gravitas to the
film, with cold, dead eyes saying more than any amount of
words.
Much of the acting is tough yet realistic, with one standout scene
involving
Peschi telling Liotta a story in a restaurant. Folklore would have us
believe that a majority of the scene is improvised making the
unpredictable
nature of the film clear and chilling.
When speaking of style, 'Goodfellas' has it in abundance and pivotal to
this
individualistic style is the use of narration. Placed firmly by Henry's
side
throughout, the actions he takes become almost acceptable - a criticism
often levelled at this type of film. A feeling of 'Sympathy For The Devil'
if you will.
Scorsese's masterful use of kinetic camerawork in the latter stages of the
film also does well to reflect the cocaine-fuelled state of mind of our
protagonist.
One can never be sure of the authenticity of films based on true events
but
'Goodfellas' seems at the very least better than most.. A modern classic
you'll be reaching for again and again.
