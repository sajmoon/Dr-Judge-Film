Just take a look at the top 250 list. Which movie has been at the top ALL
the time (except for when Lord of The Rings was new and manage to race to
the pole position and stay there for a couple of days)? It's Francis Ford
Coppola's &quot;The Godfather&quot;, based on a book by Mario Puzo!<br /><br />The Godfather is said to have been premiered in 1972 (I won't know, because
I wasn't born back then), and during all the time I watched &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, i
couldn't help feeling how much of a wannabe Martin Scorsese must've been
when he directed his version of a 1900's mafia movie. He couldn't even write
his own look-alike script, he had to do it JUST like Coppola and take a book
about the mob and make a movie out of it. I'm not saying I could have done
it any better, but how much of a rip-off isn't this &quot;Goodfellas&quot;?<br /><br />Nothing wrong about the execution of the movie shooting though. Good actors,
although I'm sick and tired of seeing Robert De Niro as a mobster. I'll give
this movie a 4 out of 10.
