This is most certainly my favourite film.  The cast is suberb (with an
oscar-winning performance by the superb Joe Pesci), the soundtrack is
fantastic and the film is both incredibly dramatic and wonderfully funny
(note the &quot;burial&quot; and &quot;prison&quot; scenes).  Scorcese's direction is perfect,
as is the script.  After watching this, the Godfather looks like...well
rubbish.
