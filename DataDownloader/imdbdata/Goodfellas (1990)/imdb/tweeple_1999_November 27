Scorsese is undoubtedly the leader in that select group of American
directors, including Kubrick, Welles, Spielberg (and one day Tarantino),
that never miss with a movie. While the 70's and 80's saw him construct
masterpieces with effortless ease, his passage into the 90's came from
'Goodfellas', a film that can easily match 'Taxi Driver', 'Raging Bull'
and
'King Of Comedy' for intensity and technique.<br /><br />The film charts mafia exploits through three generations. Tremendous
acting
from Scorsese-favourite DeNiro, short-fused Pesci, and Ray Liotta allow
some
of the most memorable scenes in modern cinema. The steadycam shot
following
Liotta into the club, and the seamless &quot;funny like a clown...&quot;
confrontation
between Pesci and Liotta are movie classics. Combine a great music score,
lashings of atmosphere, unsentimental direction and the most vivid look at
mob life to date, and 'Goodfellas' can truly be called the masterpiece of
the nineties.
