Scorsese has combined ambigiuos camera angles and solid acting to make
the greatest movie of all time.To the set pieces and costumes and the
script, this stands alone as the greatest.With real events and deep
characters,Goodfellas surpasses the age of time and reaches the limits
of movie-making.<br /><br />Ray Liotta is a funny,charismatic Henry Hill who seems to love the
gangster life style and its rewards<br /><br />Joe Pesci shows how maniacal senses and unstable actions can make a
great movie character<br /><br />Rob Deniro is at his best with Jimmy Conway.Not only is his acting on
par with the greats(Brando)but shows real emotion
