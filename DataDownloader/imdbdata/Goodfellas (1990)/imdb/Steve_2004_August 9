Goodfellas makes a strong case for itself as the most overrated movie
of the 80s or any decade. Never in my life have I encountered a film
less deserving of its critical and popular accolades. After watching it
for the second time recently (to make sure my impression from a viewing
years earlier was accurate), I feel every person involved in the
picture, and particularly Martin Scorsese, deserves to be punished
severely for inflicting Goodfellas upon me.<br /><br />Goodfellas has absolutely nothing to offer. It has neither the wisdom
nor the compassion to say or reveal anything about life or human
beings. Anyway, Goodfellas is not interested in that. It just wants to
be smart, hip, and funny. With such lofty goals, it's a wonder this
entire star-studded cast of actors and filmmakers fell so very, very
short. <br /><br />Goodfellas is not smart. It is not intelligent enough to understand
what it think it portrays on an individual or larger basis. It does not
somehow explain or explore the mob psyche, the existence of organized
crime in America, or anything else for that matter. Despite the fact
that it is taken from actual events and people, it seems to desire no
contact with reality.<br /><br />Goodfellas is not hip. Apparently Martin Scorsese was not aware that
there is nothing less cool than trying hard to be cool. Goodfellas is
full of flashy camera moves, tough looking guys in swank suits, and
more fast, colloquial dialogue than you could beat out of Dashiell
Hammett, but none of it adds up to anything but slime. Yes, that's
right: slime. Goodfellas is so obnoxious you want to take a magical
eraser and scrub each of its characters back into the pure white on the
page from which they sprang. Is this an honorable aim for a film? To
make you hate its characters, to make you hate its voice? Let me be the
one to say that cynicism is generally a good cover for laziness, and as
an approach to life it is one step above nihilism. Real cynicism has no
place in art. <br /><br />Goodfellas is not funny. A complete lack of respect for human life is
not a secret recipe for brilliant ironic comedy. It is disgusting,
really, and those who laugh reserve a spot for themselves in the grime
between the cracks under the bottom of the barrel of good humor.<br /><br />The performances in Goodfellas, much lauded, are ridiculously
one-sided. How wonderful they managed to span the chasm between looking
tough and looking smug - all except for Ray Liotta who has to do the
balancing act between being paranoid and annoyed. Bravo.<br /><br />Of note is Scorsese's choice to play pop music over 95 percent of the
film, presumably so that we have something to listen to while we are
busy ignoring his movie.<br /><br />Goodfellas is trash. Utter trash. The only thing I took out of it is
that it is unwise to let a gangster stand behind you.
