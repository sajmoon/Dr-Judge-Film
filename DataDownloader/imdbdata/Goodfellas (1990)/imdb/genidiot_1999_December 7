1999_December 7 

   What an awesome movie! This is one movie that belongs in everyone's
library. The thrills, the laughs, the heartbreaks, the go-get-'em
attitude..this film doesn't miss a thing. The acting is great. Ray Liotta's
narration gives the viewer a much closer look at some of the most
interesting characters. Joe Pesci is wonderful and got a well-deserved
oscar. An absolute masterpiece. 9/10
