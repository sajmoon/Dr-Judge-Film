this is one of the few films that can be watched over and over.the sound
track is brilliant as is the casting.this film is truly the number one
gangster flick of all time.more films should be as good as goodfellas,then
maybe hollywood wouldn't be in such a mess as it is in today what with all
the rubbish and special effects films that are now wearing a bit
thin.
