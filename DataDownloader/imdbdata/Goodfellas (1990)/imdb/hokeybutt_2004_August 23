GOODFELLAS (5 outta 5 stars)<br /><br />I remember thinking, when this movie came out &quot;Oh, here goes Scorsese
again... another Italian gangster movie... ho hum... small role for
DeNiro... big deal.&quot;  Was I ever wrong!  My low expectations were completely
turned upside down by this epic, sprawling masterpiece.  What it has taken
&quot;The Sopranos&quot; 4 seasons and umpteen hours to portray... &quot;Goodfellas&quot; gets
it all done in just over 2 and 1/2.  Ray Liotta portrays Henry Hill, a punk
kid from a good family who gets in tight with the local mob, rising up in
their ranks by robbing, killing and dealing drugs... until his inevitable
fall.  Terrific cast of memorable characters (a lot of whom may not have
been famous at the time but are certainly more well-known now)!  Rivetting
storyline... practically every scene is a classic.  Very funny scenes
interspersed with shockingly violent brutality.  Director Martin Scorsese
was firing on all cylinders this time out... not a dull moment or a slack
scene to be found.  Robert DeNiro has probably the least interesting
character to play in this movie... and look what he does with it!  Amazing! 
Bonus points to Paul Sorvino who has his best screen role ever.  Don't miss
this one!
