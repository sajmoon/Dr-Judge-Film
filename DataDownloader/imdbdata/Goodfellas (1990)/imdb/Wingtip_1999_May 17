1999_May 17 

This has to be one of the best movies about mob life ever made. Watching
DeNiro, Liotta and Pesci's characters grow up in a life where theft and
violence is commonplace is really something. One of the most amazing
things
about this film is the way in which Scorcese gets his actors to display
such
a calm attitude toward one aspect of life and then immediately switch to
brutality and killing one minute later. I counted at least three examples
of
this phenomenon, but I will not explain them, lest I spoil the movie for
someone else.<br /><br />Although this movie was released the same year as Godfather III, it still
stands on its own, due to the fact that it shows us another, lower level
of
organized crime. I would highly recommend both Goodfellas and the
Godfather
III as well as another very well portrayed movie called A Bronx Tale.
Finally, if you want to really have a mob movie fest, watch Goodfellas and
then watch My Blue Heaven. This is a Steve Martin comedy, but the movie
starts right where Goodfellas leaves off.
