&quot;Goodfellas&quot; is a superb movie presenting an amoral and very
real-seeming portrait of the Mafia. Where &quot;The Godfather&quot; limits itself
to a sepia palette and a somber tone, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is brash, busy, and
captures both the humor and the horror of a mobster&#39;s life. Nor do the
Goodfellas pretend to have noble motivations. Instead, they&#39;re a bunch
of power-hungry guys who band together for protection but double-cross
each other at the first opportunity. Many admit to a compulsive love
for crime, including robber Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and,
especially, the unhinged, trigger-happy Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci).<br /><br />Tommy and Jimmy are the closest associates of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta),
the movie&#39;s narrator and main character: all are mid-level mob guys who
start out around the same time. Henry is half-Irish, so he knows that
the Mafia will never fully welcome him. This outsider quality
complicates his personality and makes him an ideal narrator.<br /><br />&quot;Goodfellas&quot; runs on style and atmosphere rather than a linear plot.
The first hour&#151; culminating in the famous long-take at the Copacabana
nightclub&#151;shows the glamorous appeal of the mob lifestyle for young
Henry. It&#39;s the Rat Pack early sixties, and America and the mob are
still somehow innocent. As we follow Henry into the late sixties and
beyond, the mob becomes more insular and a parody of what it once was.
The women have tacky outfits and hard-edged faces; the men&#39;s crimes get
bigger. Henry gets involved in drug dealing, and his wife Karen
(Lorraine Bracco) turns from a tough-but-sweet Jewish girl into a full-
fledged Mafia wife.<br /><br />The best part of the movie is the virtuoso, suspenseful, darkly funny
sequence (it could almost stand on its own as a short film) where
Henry&#39;s responsibilities as mobster and family man threaten to
overwhelm him. In the course of a single day, he must keep his drug
smuggling, mafia connections, large extended family, and mistress under
control, while trying to evade a helicopter that seems to be following
him. The editing and music perfectly recreate Henry&#39;s jittery,
cocaine-fueled paranoia. Indeed, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; has probably the best
compilation soundtrack that I&#39;ve ever heard: each song perfectly fits.<br /><br />There is always so much going on at once in &quot;Goodfellas&quot;&#151;music,
narration, dialogue, camera movements and images&#151;that boredom is not an
option and dazzling moments come frequently. And its ambivalent moral
perspective (should we love these men and their lifestyle, or hate
them?) gives you something to think about after the pop songs and
shootings have ended.
