1999_July 6 

Almost too good? I'll explain why. GoodFellas had a big impact on the
movie
fans and film industry. To the point where any picture you see with
DeNiro,Pesci,or Liotta you look for GoodFellas in it. DeNiro can play
anybody or any thing. Pesci can't! No matter how hard he tries to do
something different. Jimmy Hollywood,With Honors-Yeah right! Don't work
that
way,Joe! It's a no-win situation!   He does something different-he's
unconvincing.He plays something similar to Tommy DeVito in GoodFellas-it
will be obvious and no where near as good. It's almost like he used up all
the good one-liners in GoodFellas. Liotta can try to to something
different,but he'll always be remembered as Henry Hill. There were a lot
of
GoodFellas/Scorcese wannabes after GoodFellas was made. Like Quentin
Tarantino(who I can't stand). GoodFellas was great! It's too bad that a
lot
of directors and screenwriters can't think of something original. Too many
copycats after GoodFellas. That's why it was too good!
