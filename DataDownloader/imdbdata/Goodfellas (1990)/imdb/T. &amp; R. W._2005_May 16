Gangster movies are always popular; they combine the quick action of
the Wild West with a certain degree of politeness and courtesy that
makes the whole world seem intriguingly different to anything else
you've seen. And it makes for reasonable cinema; but it's not the film
many people make it out to be. It's enjoyable, and it probably will
hold your attention. The fact that it's based on a true story, too,
adds a little quality to it that makes it intriguing. But the character
development is limited; only De Niro's character really seems to move
during the film, and in that way, reality loses out to cinema fiction
here. As a documentary, I think something like this would have been
very fascinating. As a film, though, it seems to be lacking something
somewhere down the line.<br /><br />When all's said and done, it's a decent and enjoyable film, but there
are plenty of better films out there. It's worth a watch, sure. It has
some good performances, from an impressive cast - De Niro's performance
is as good as you might hope or expect from him - and the film's ending
is certainly memorable. But at the end, it feels a little stretched at
2 1/2 hours, and it falls short of being spectacular.
