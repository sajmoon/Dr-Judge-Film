1998_September 4 

Probably the finest film of the past decade, Goodfellas has all the
ingredients of a perfect movie. An excellent script, a soundtrack which is
as memorable as the film itself and unforgettable character acting -
especially by De Niro and Pesci. Scorcese makes the world of the 'Wiseguy'
as appealing and exciting as Francis Ford Coppola did in his Godfather
masterpieces, with the added bonus of rapid fire dialogues. Whereas one may
remember single lines from The Godfather, any fan of Goodfellas would be
able to recite entire conversations, such as the 'What am I, a clown?'... A
perfect movie.
