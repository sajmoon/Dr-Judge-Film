I don&#39;t understand this film. The people in it aren&#39;t &#39;good fellows&#39; at
all. In fact they&#39;re despicable low life scum and if I was around when
they were around I would give them all a good clip around the ear and
teach them to show a bit more respect to people. Otherwise, a nice
solid film. It inspired me and Clem to grow pencil moustaches and to
tough up some of the local kids on our estate. Clem would bring them
into my &#39;office&#39; and we would give them &#39;advice&#39;. I now hang around on
corners &#39;staring&#39;at people. I&#39;m the daddy now, you see. I&#39;m the egg on
toast. I&#39;m number one, get me? Soon this town will be mine. People will
be eating out of my hands. I&#39;m daddy-two bucks. I&#39;m papa moses. I&#39;m
dick AND Dom. Loser!
