i could watch these three great actors, rl, rd and jp portray the 'real
life' story of three legendary figures in the gangsta world. jimmy conway,
henry hill and tommy devito, i have watched the film over 10  times since
i
went out and bought it after watching it on tv. joe pesci played a
magnificent role as tommy devito. he has a incredible talent playing
'gangsta roles, the same with rd and rl, i would like to see the 'duo' in
future in fresh new roles. in a gangsta film of course. plus i recommend
seeing casino, its a great film.
