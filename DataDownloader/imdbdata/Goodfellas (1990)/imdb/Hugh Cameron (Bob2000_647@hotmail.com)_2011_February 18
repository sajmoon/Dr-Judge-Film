It must be said for the Gangster genre of films, that it is rather
translucent. Some people will see it as solid gold, others as shallow,
hollow, and transparent. Certainly the original 1920s Scarface was an
adequate piece of work. Incredibly though in over 80 years of film, the
Gangster genre has gone nowhere. From boring expositions of characters,
character relations, and a lot of Italians in The Godfather, to
something even drier, emptier, and duller in Good-fellas, this may be
one of the most despicable genres ever made.<br /><br />The characters in Goodfellas are not necessarily empty and dry, there
is the open and influenced Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), the evil and
terrifying Tommy Devito (Joe Pesci), and the subtle but nonetheless
meaninglessly dull Jimmy Conway (Robert Deniro). None of the
characters, despite their uniqueness and relative diversity, are ever
that compelling or interesting. The story, a soapy saga of Mafia and
Con-men running around going about their daily business, is equally
dry. Most of the film is about how great and glorious Mafia-men can be
apparently in their various exploits. There is nothing really that
significant that is ever captured on-screen from any of the film&#x27;s
various scenes. Besides, who really cares about whether this empty
nothingness of a film were to be supplemented with strong dialogue and
acting. Because then again, who cares if the dried up popscicle has any
scant crystals of pure sugar on it. Who cares if villainous and
primeval creations such as this film, have bright sides waiting to come
out and shine.<br /><br />An inquiry should be made into why directors still can get away with
not advancing the gangster genre. This genre was uninteresting, and
depicted uninteresting criminals in the first place. Criminals make
other peoples lives miserable. Yet we decorate these cinematic idiots
who call themselves directors for.. err... their accomplishments right? <br /><br />This film is so &#x22;eventful&#x22; in it&#x27;s &#x22;story elements&#x22; of Mafia-men rising
to power, from an early life of lounging about and fulfilling
themselves in &#x22;activity&#x22;, that one desperately searches for something
to keep ones very eyes open. One finds amidst some empty and
nonexistent plot-points the character of Tommy Devito. The Joe Pesci
creation in this film is a 5-foot-tall bully, who lays waste to anyone
who says hi to him. He is equally appetizing. Immediately we begin to
lust for his death. As in most films we want the bad guys to get
killed, don&#x27;t we? I still find it hilarious that Scorsese&#x27;s characters
aren&#x27;t dry and dull. They&#x27;re so despicable we want them dead, even when
we are supposed to be following their various exploits fervently. Once
Devito is killed by some rival gang or something in a brief and
unexplained scene, we have been parted from the only ever reason we
clung on to this film. This move was unintended by Scorsese, who wanted
us to follow the actual story apparently. <br /><br />The rest of the film then becomes torturous, and seems to be about
something, such as family dinners or drug deals or... like who really
cares. Finally at the end of the film, the gangsters all go to jail. By
this point our brains have been blown out too much to make any sense
out of what is going on. This is a simple and deus ex machina kind of
ending, a Hollywood ending in which the bad guys all get apprehended
for being gangsters in the film. Of course in real American films the
villains always need to be punished at the end, right? Maybe if
Scorsese and the gang of morons who worship this film had gone to Jail
instead, then one would feel a whole lot better about devoting 3 hours
of ones time. In retrospect one watched Mafia involved in... oh wait
this film had an actual story right? A story with conflict, an
introduction, a climax, conclusion and character development right? And
it had an actual plot didn&#x27;t it?
