In my opinion, this film is far more superior than any Godfather or any
other mob movie, for that matter. Scorsese is America's top director. Can a
movie get any better? Everything you need is in this film. The best acting,
in-depth writing, and unbelievable directing. Scorsese captured every
detail. The violence was cool too (especially the guy that was buried after
Pesci beat him to near death with a gun.)
