Goodfellas, a film that immediately grabs your attention and doesn&#x27;t
let go to the final credits. The film runs for almost Two and a halve
hours but one would never notice the time racing away due to brilliant
structure and narrative. Henry&#x27;s Narration gives this film a calming
effect, he never shouts he just tells the story as if he being
investigated by the cops. With the narrative, the films rolls like a
dream. The pacing is perfect and not once do you hang around the same
scene.<br /><br />In these two hours, you learn how Henry always wanted to be a gangster.
He tells you this in the first three minutes of the film. 10 minutes
later, he a gangster and from here on, you witness the power and
glamour you receive when everyone knows who you are. The acting is
brilliant. Ray Liotta gives a outstanding performance while Joe Pesci
is steals every scene he in . DeNiro role is not as large as one would
like but he still gives a strong presence.<br /><br />The Art design is another brilliant achievement . The world around you
is portrayed perfectly that you can&#x27;t help but be dragged into the
setting. This is also helped by the directing which brings great style
and editing that the film is like a dream. Overall, a great film
