2006_September 16 
I will begin by stating that I am not a fan of the mafia genre.I am
merely watching and reviewing this film because of it&#39;s status as the
#94 film on the American Film Institute&#39;s top 100 films in cinema
history.I will give high marks to the cast,Robert DeNiro,Joe Pesci,Ray
Liotta,Paul Sorvino,and Lorraine Bracco for their performances,as they
play these types of roles very well,especially DeNiro and Pesci.I just
don&#39;t connect very well with mafia story lines,as I feel that they only
serve to glorify the real mafia.I will not question any of the AFI&#39;s
choices for best films ever,but as a matter of personal taste,I have to
say that I just don&#39;t like the film as a whole,and will probably never
view it again.
