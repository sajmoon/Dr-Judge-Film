Without a doubt, Goodfellas is Martin Scorsese's chef d'oeuvre.  This
adaptation of Pileggi's book is a masterpiece of cinematography.  Rather
than have you read through a superlative-packed review, I urge you to just
watch it if you haven't already. And look out for the special edition DVD
that I hope Warner will release promptly. 10/10
