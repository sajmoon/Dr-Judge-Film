This is one of the most impressive movies I&#39;ve seen at the film-making
level. I&#39;m extremely interested in the way directors build films as
audiovisual evocative worlds with specific rules, more than I am in the
actual stories told, so of course I enjoyed this immensely.<br /><br />I can see the influence this film had on many directors, sadly the
style elements that were borrowed from it (mainly the editing/score
style) have been very badly executed most of the time. Strangely, I
think that only french directors Gaspard No&eacute; (in &quot;Carne&quot; and &quot;Seul
contre tous&quot;) and Jean-Pierre Jeunet (in &quot;Delicatessen&quot; and &quot;Am&eacute;lie&quot;)
could pull off effective cinematic works with these editing/score
structures. Since then, in mainstream cinema, these elements have
mostly degenerated in a derivative mannerism without any power. Sad.<br /><br />Yeah, I definitely enjoyed the ride, and took good note of many
fantastic cinematic devices, some great subtext (food as philosophy,
almost as a character)... but still I have complaints.<br /><br />The first one is De Niro. Sorry but when I see him here, I still see an
actor, not a character. I can take this when the movie takes a strong
self-referential stance, deliberately using actors as actors, like in
&quot;Jackie Brown&quot; or &quot;Brazil&quot; where De Niro fits perfectly. But here it
doesn&#39;t work for me, I found it distracting (&quot;hey, look, it&#39;s De
Niro!&quot;).<br /><br />The second one is the root substance. These mob operas generally are
entertaining, but have a very shallow philosophy, follow very strict
narrative conventions and don&#39;t have much to offer as culture. I even
find them rather questionable as role models for adolescents.<br /><br />So what we have here is brilliant thanks to the director, and the
director only. Even at the acting level: yes they&#39;re good, but their
acting alone wouldn&#39;t have such power showed if Scorcese had not used
them as a Chess Master, moving pieces on the board.<br /><br />Shallow substance, but very intelligent movie-making with power, wit
and imagination. Enthralling. So much so that it&#39;s only when the movie
is over that one (possibly) realizes that something is missing. A
tour-de-force.
