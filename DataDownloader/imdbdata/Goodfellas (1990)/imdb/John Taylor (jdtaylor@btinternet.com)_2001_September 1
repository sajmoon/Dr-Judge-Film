What can you say about Goodfellas that has not already been
said?
It is difficult to review a film that nearly everybody has seen and nearly
everybody loves.
Goodfellas is without doubt the best gangster film ever made and in my
opinion in the top three films of all time.
Ray Liota,Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are all fantastic but for me the
latter steals the show. Joe Pesci is the most frightening gangster ever seen
for me and the scene where he winds Liota up with his &quot;how am i funny&quot; in
the resterant is scary!
Scorsese directs this film like no other. You can watch this film over and
over again and see something new everytime (and i have).
I think what also makes Googfellas so viewer friendly is the narration by
Liota throughout the movie.You are never left in doubt as to what is going
on.I must have seen Goodfellas a dozen times now and i'm sure there will be
many more times i watch it.
For fans of the Soprannos look out for how many people are in this and the 
HBO gangster show. I counted at least 5.
10 out of 10.
