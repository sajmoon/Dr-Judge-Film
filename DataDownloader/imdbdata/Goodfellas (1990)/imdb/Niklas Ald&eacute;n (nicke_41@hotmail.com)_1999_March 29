1999_March 29 

Simply the best gangster movie ever made.Great story, great directing,
great
actors (especially Joe Pesci).Ray Liotta was outstanding and should have
won
an Oscar for his brilliant performance.De Niro is at his best
also.
If you liked The Godfather trilogy then you&acute;ll love this
one!!!
