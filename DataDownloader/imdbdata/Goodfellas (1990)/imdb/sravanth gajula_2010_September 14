Goodfellas is Martin Scorsese&#x27;s remarkable mobster classic of all time.
This delicately handled masterpiece has everything a great movie should
have...intense story, gripping screenplay, fabulous direction,
excellent cinematography, and most important of all, perfect star cast. <br /><br />The performances by Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Paul Sorvino
are outstanding. The way Joe Pesci&#x27;s character portrayed is worth a
special mention. I am a huge fan of Pesci since Raging Bull, but I
would remember him as &#x27;Tommy&#x27; for the rest of my life. <br /><br />Twenty years after release, I&#x27;ve seen this film now and I can say
without a doubt it&#x27;s a modern classic. Twenty years from now, this
movie still will be a modern classic. Hats off to Martin Scorsese!!
