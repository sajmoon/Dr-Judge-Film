Puzo's tale described the brilliant Sicilians of early 20th century
America who were compelled to form organized crime syndicates because
legitimate society would not accept them into its upper echelons.
Goodfellas chronicles the underlings who were left over when the
Dartmouth educated Michael Corleones of the mafia were gradually
accepted into mainstream society--i.e. politics, business, law,
science, and art. So it is no surprise that Goodfellas appears aimed
primarily at the Daily News reading overweight highschool dropout male
18-47 demographic who listen to Howard Stern in the morning, blow half
their weekly paycheck on strip clubs and sports betting, and vacation
in Vegas. Some of the IMDb's brightest film commentators love this
movie, which is a mystery to me. All I got out of it were some OK
recipes. Paul's Points: 4.7---Movies it copied: Godfather, Mean
Streets, Raging Bull
