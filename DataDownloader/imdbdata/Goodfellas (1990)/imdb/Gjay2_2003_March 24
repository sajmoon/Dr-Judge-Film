after only being made in 1990, it's amazing how much of a 'classic' it is
known as already. But it deserves every bit of applause that it gets, as
it
truly is a legendary film. Right from the start, you are pulled head first
into this world of petty crooks, and murderous gangsters, and the pace
just
never slows down. You have pesci, and liotta all putting in their best
work.
De niro is great but not new. And with scorsese behind the camera, the
audience are treated to some brilliantly executed scenes. Be it the
'classic' &quot;you think i'm funny?&quot; scene, or the handgun to the nose beating
scene, which is done so realistically, you can feel the cracks as his nose
spurts blood. And the use of music in the film fits like a glove, really
setting a tone, and enhancing the mood. I don't think it could have been
put
together more perfectly. It's a long film, but it's one you never actually
want to end.
