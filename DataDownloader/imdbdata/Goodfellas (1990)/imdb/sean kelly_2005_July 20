This movie isn't light hearted its one of the best male movies ever
with drugs violence and a glimpse of sex this movie has everything a
man needs and don't forget the amazing teaming of De Niro Liotta and
Pesci!!! if u liked this u should try movies like casino this also
teams up De Niro pesci and director martin Scorsese<br /><br />if u like De niro or hard hitting mafia dramas u should try this one
out not for the light heart though !!!!! if u liked the sopranos this
is for u two actors from the show appear in this movie Lorraine Bracco
and Michael Imperioli!!! this movie proves Pesci is a though guy even
though his is tiny but is also funny !!!!!! De Niro is a good as ever
and is also aggressive as in his other movies Raging Bull , The
Untocuhables and The godfather 2
