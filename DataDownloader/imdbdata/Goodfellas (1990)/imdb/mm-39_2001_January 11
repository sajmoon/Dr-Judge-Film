This movie is alot like the movie Mean streats, but with a higher
budget.
I read the book &quot;Wise guy&quot; and the movie follow the book well.  When I
read
a book I have piture go threw my head of what I am reading, and this moive
did this with out myself having to read the book again. Beliveable, and
directed in the manner of the author telling the story.  The art of story
tell is a lost one with many the entertainment industry marketing for a
public with  a short attenion span, but in the world of Jerry Springer, and
professional wrestling, where the product is directed at a 2 second
attention span this moive cuts down the quick fix mentaliy of our time.
This is a well crafted film, which has a story told and unravels in proper
fourm.  This is a nice break from factory made fourmulated moives where you
can guess the script 10 minitues into the movie.  Like the music industry
where all the county music and dance music sounds the same, alot of movie
go
this route,this movie stands out from the repetition.
