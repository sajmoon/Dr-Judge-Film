Goodfellas has everything a film watcher could want- Comedy, Drama,
Violence, Sex, ETC.  The only difference is that this film also is based
on
a true story and that adds to the greatness of Scorcese's picture making.
Not only that, the performances are totally top notch (only De Niro gets
to
much acclaim for what is really a co-starring role) including Liotta,
Bracco, and Pesci.  If there is a movie for thrill seekers and film buffs,
this one IS for you.
