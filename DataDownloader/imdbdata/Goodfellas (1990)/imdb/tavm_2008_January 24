While I had previously seen this Martin Scorsese picture before, it was
on network television which meant I didn&#39;t hear the profanity and the
violent scenes were trimmed. Despite that, I remember enjoying the
movie very much. Now that I&#39;ve seen it uncensored and on HD DVD, it
doesn&#39;t impress me as much as before perhaps because in jumping several
years in various segments, you half wonder what happened during those
in-between times. Still, Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and
Larraine Bracco impress with their performances with Paul Sorvino
lending gravity with his appearances throughout and nice cameos by
up-and-coming newcomers like Illeana Douglas, Debi Mazar, Samuel L.
Jackson, and Michael Imperioli. Also amusing were cameos by the
director&#39;s parents, Catherine and Charles, especially Catherine&#39;s as
Pesci&#39;s mother. Pesci may be the most impressive of the bunch in his
Oscar-winning role as Tommy who turns from highly amused to very angry
at a dime. Perhaps not one for the mainstream crowd who wants at least
one likable character to identify with but a mostly compelling account
of the true story of what mob life really was like for someone who
lived through it.
