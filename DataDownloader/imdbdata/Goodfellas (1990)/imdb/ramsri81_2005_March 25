Well I always liked Martin Scorcese movies, and probably during the
late 80's and early 90's he made few of his very good movies.This one
probably tops the list during that period.Well real life
story,Deniro,Pesci, and surprisingly Ray doing very good for their
roles really makes the movie one of the master pieces in this genre.
Its about Henry and his life in the world of Mobs and Gsngsters and the
people who help him to get to the top and eventually bring him down
again.Definitive work on a real mob story.Well except for the running
time of the movie really no complains on this movie.A definite
9/10.....
