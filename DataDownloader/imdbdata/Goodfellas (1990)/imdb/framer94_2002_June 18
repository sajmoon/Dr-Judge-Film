Sorcesse's depiction of organised crime through the 1950s-1980s. Robert
Deniro is as brilliant and as intimidating as ever in these sorts of films.
It explore personal build up and development in growing USA, up until self
destruction. Nothing in this film is out of place; there are extreemly funny
(if not ultra violent scenes) followed by very serious ones. i cant find any
complaints to make on this film AT ALL.<br /><br />A solid 10/10.
