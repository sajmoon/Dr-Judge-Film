1999_August 2 

This is possibly the best Mafia movie you could ever see.
Ray Liotta, in one of his best roles, narrates throughout the movie, and
it
works wonderfully.
This movie tries to show the true feeling of being a gangster; you never
know who your friends are, and never trust anyone.
De Niro is good, Pesci is good, and the direction by Scorcese is good.
This
movie is hard, cold and cruel. It's highly recommended.<br /><br />
