Goodfellas is a pretty mesmerizing film. Martin Scorsese at his best is
an incredibly dynamic director and Goodfellas is most certainly one of
his greatest achievements. For a film that clocks in at two and a half
hours it sure moves at a fast pace. This is a movie that never lags.
There is no waste. It&#x27;s a master-class in how to keep an audience glued
to a screen.<br /><br />It documents the story of Henry Hill the real life gangster. Like the
30&#x27;s gangster films it&#x27;s a rise and fall epic, but unlike these the
resolution is a lot more ambiguous and the overall presentation is
considerably more complex. I&#x27;m not sure how close the film is to actual
events, but I do realize that some principal characters have had their
names changed for some reason. Ultimately, the level of actual
authenticity doesn&#x27;t matter very much as this is a superlative film
either way.<br /><br />Scorsese has never been afraid to go to extremes. This film like many
of his others is very raw. Language and violence are strong; the
latter, very much so in the murder of the character Billy Batts. The
brutality adds an undeniable visceral appeal to the film. Yet it does
still seem entirely justifiable within the context of the story. Acting
is universally top drawer with everybody giving terrific performances.
Although special mention does have to go to Joe Pesci whose character
Tommy is seriously unforgettable. Tommy is a pint-sized sociopath with
a pretty monumental chip on his shoulder. Most film-makers would never
have recognized that an actor as small as Pesci would be ideal for the
role of this character. But Pesci&#x27;s size and high-pitched voice only
add to his menace somehow, it&#x27;s as if these defects of his character
make Tommy even more at war with the world and make him an even more
bitter and dangerous guy. Scorsese&#x27;s trademark use of popular music is
excellently incorporated into the film. The tunes by turns indicate the
time period, parallel the events and add an ironic backdrop to
proceedings. It&#x27;s a textbook example of how to compose a soundtrack
with contemporary music but in a way that adds depth and meaning.<br /><br />In a nutshell, Goodfellas is arguably the best gangster film out there.
As a piece of cinema, it is thrilling. Recommended unreservedly.
