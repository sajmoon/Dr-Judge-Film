GoodFellas, one of my all time favorite movies, is put together in an
incredible way.  The cinematography and editing is amazing.  The movie flows
better than any movie I've ever seen.  Each shot goes into the next
perfectly.  Also the sound and visual images are not cut at the same time
in most places, smoothing out the transitions even more.  along with Taxi
Driver, it is Scorsese's best picture.  Also, like most Scorsese films, the
characters (perhaps with the exception of Tommy) although brutal criminals,
are very accesible and understandable.  I can really relate to their
feelings.  It is a truly great movie.
