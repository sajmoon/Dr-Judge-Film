2000_May 2 

A hard hitting script, a stunning sound track, a fantastic cast all
combined
with one of the great directors of the 20th century, make this one of the
best films ever made. Including the finest virtuoso continuous moving
camera
sequence in cinema, the most memorable performance from (the lead actor
whose name I can't include in this review as the database spell check won't
accept it) since Taxi Driver, this film jumps right out of the screen,
grabs
you by the collar, and doesn't let go until the credits roll in. Showing
everything that is great and terrible about Mafia life, from how to chop
garlic when you're inside prison to how to arrange and execute a mob hit.
Do
not miss this film - I say it again - do not miss this
film.
