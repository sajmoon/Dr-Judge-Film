This excellent mob film is, in my opinion, the best movie of 1990.  It is
well-written, and generally well-made.  If you like Mafia films, I
recommend
watching 'GoodFellas.' Ray Liotta's character, Henry Hill, may be the
primary focus in the film, but Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro are the actual
highlights.<br /><br />I'm aware that Joe Pesci won an Oscar for his performance in the film.
His
character, Tommy Devito, is one sick b****rd.  Yet, I like his sense of
humor, especially when he asked, &quot;How am I funny?&quot;  Whenever I watch that
scene where he asks Henry Hill that question, it's hard for me to keep a
straight face.  Pesci just cracks me up.<br /><br />Robert DeNiro does the role of Jimmy Conway well.  But if there's anything
that the actor is generally good at, it is cursing, especially when he
says
the F-word.  It's just the way he swears that's interesting.  But is it
unique?  The answer is: Little bit!
