If not better! This is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the 90's.
I have to admit, I never paid much attention to gangster flicks until I
saw this masterpiece. The movie is adapted from the book &quot;Wiseguy&quot; by
Nicholas Pileggi, and I have to say, Scorsese did an excellent job. The
movie tells the true story of Henry Hill(Ray Liotta) and his life in
the mob. It tells about how he came into the mob, his troubled love
life, and his relationship with his friends: The psycho Tommy
DeVito(Joe Pesci) and the respected Jimmy &quot;The Gent&quot; Conway(Robert
DeNiro). The whole cast delivers excellent performances and the use of
music in this movie is some of the best I've seen. The real Henry Hill
once said that the portrayal of mob life in this movie is 99% accurate.
I recommend this to not only mob movie lovers, but movie lovers in
general!
