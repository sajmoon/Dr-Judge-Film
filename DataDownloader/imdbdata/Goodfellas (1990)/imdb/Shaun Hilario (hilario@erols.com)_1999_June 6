1999_June 6 

This film is awesome. You have everything in here from violence to comedy,
to realism.  Martin Scorcese proves that he is a master of his craft.  You
want to see a great shot? Check out the shot where Henry Hill takes his
wife
through the club.<br /><br />Goodfellas' story is really about what goes on in mob life, and the rise
and
fall of a 'wiseguys' played by Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta
(which is by far his best performance in any film i've ever
seen).<br /><br />Scorcese's direction is flashy, quick, and perfect.  No part in the movie
is
boring, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat, which films like
'donnie
brasco' fail to do.  The editing is absoulely perfect.  The variety of
songs
found in the soundtrack was masterfully chosen by Robbie Robertson (i
think)
member of THE BAND. (Scorcese filmed one of the concerts called THE LAST
WALTZ).<br /><br />The violence and language were realistically done.  This may turn off some
conservative film goers.  They may argue that the film is way too violent,
and the language is ridiculous.  But they fail to grasp that it is the
violence and language that makes Goodfellas so realistic.  Basically, if
you
get turned off from violence and language, you may want to avoid it, but
by
doing so, you're missing out on a great artistic film.  One of my favorite
films!
