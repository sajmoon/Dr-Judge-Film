2003_November 8 

I absolutely can't remember how many times I have seen this movie but
every
time I discover new things I saw not before and I am sure it's one of
those
rare movies that are made to watch over and over just because it might
perhaps be the best movie ever made, and if not it certainly is in the Top
10 of it somewhere.
There are so many stars in here... Martin Scorsese who just is the ideal
proof that a director can be a personality himself, someone who you can
recognize from style (I am sure that you only will can come up with 20
directors of so whose style can be recognized), Robert De Niro who is just
the best actor of all time, full stop, Ray Liotta who perhaps could have
join De Niro if only he had some better roles to play as in here he is
superb, Joe Pesci who plays the ideal gangster who is nuts, Lorraine
Bracco
who plays the perfect role of the woman that will always stay loyal to her
gangsterhusband, the soundtrack (just remember how Sid Vicious' &quot;My way&quot;
or
Derek and The Dominos' &quot;Layla&quot; has been used).
I am sure I will rewatch this movie soon, for the 20th or 30th time
perhaps...and indeed better than all gangstermovies ever
made.
