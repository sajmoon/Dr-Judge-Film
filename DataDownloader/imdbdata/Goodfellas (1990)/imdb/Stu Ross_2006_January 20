the soundtrack CD for this movie could easily be a 2 or even 3 disc
set, so many excellent songs left off. George Harrison's &quot;What Is
Life&quot;, The Rolling Stones &quot;Monkey Man&quot;, (and dare I say it?) Jerry Vale
(whatever song he was singing during nightclub scene with Henry and
Janice), and so many others. (I'll even go out on a limb and say &quot;My
Way&quot; by Sid Vicious. lol.) Few directors used music to compliment
what's on the screen better than Scorcese did in this movie, and most
of his others, for that matter. A perfect example is when Henry,
Paulie, et al are in prison in the 1970's , and Bobby Darin's &quot;Beyond
the Sea&quot; from 1960 is the background. IMHO, it's a kind of time warp,
even though things &quot;on the outside&quot; have changed, and our boys are in
the hoosegow, they're still living like kings.<br /><br />All opinions welcome, as long as they are coherent. lol
