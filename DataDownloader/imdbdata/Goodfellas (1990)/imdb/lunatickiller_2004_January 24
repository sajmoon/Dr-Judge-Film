This is a freat film about a young boy who looked up to mobsters.he
figured
that if he could become one , people would respect him and fear him
also.He
started working for the maffia very young and people started to fear , but
also respect him.Just like he expected.He climbs up higher on the ladder
as
he becomes older and wiser.Though one day he has to make a choice :
Getting
murdered or betraying his maffia friends.<br /><br />This is an excellent film about the maffia.The oscar Joe Pesci received
was
correctly given to him.It is without any doubt his best role.Robert de
Niro
is outstanding too.<br /><br />This movie shows how mobsters live and the most important is that , I
think
, it kind of goes that way.The image is very realistic but we must always
see everything with a pinch of salt.<br /><br />The best maffia film after the Godfather and Scarface! A must
see!
