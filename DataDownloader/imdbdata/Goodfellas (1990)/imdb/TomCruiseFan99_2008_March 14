One of my favorite films of all time, second only to A Few Good men,
this darkly comic and boldly violent gangster epic is a true
masterpiece. Featuring career-best performances from Robert De Niro,
Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco as well as a career-making one from Joe
Pesci, who fully deserved his Academy Award.<br /><br />The film follows a 30-year period in the lives of Henry Hill (Liotta)
and his association with the Italian Mafia. The script features some of
the most laugh-out-loud moments ever in a serious crime drama (all the
good bits are delivered with extra zing by Pesci), and also some of the
most expletive-filled rants (once again, courtesy of Pesci). The
violence won&#39;t be for all tastes, but it&#39;s necessary in this story,
especially when the script constantly surprises you and you start
realizing that you have no idea who might live and who might die or
who&#39;s going to jail and who&#39;ll live happy ever after.<br /><br />Because as Henry soon finds out, once you&#39;re in the family, there&#39;s no
way out. Special mention has to be made of Scorsese&#39;s brilliant
directing, which includes some glorious unbroken tracking shots and a
60&#39;s Motown soundtrack that&#39;s to die for. A classic in every sense of
the word.
