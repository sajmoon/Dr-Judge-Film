I have one annual event each year to pass the date of my birth.  That is
to
wake up and watch GOODFELLAS!  I am here to tell you that for the past 10
years, there is no better way to start off my birthday morning.  DeNiro's
character Jimmy Conway is my favorite without a doubt, especially when he
starts offing his own crew.  The soundtrack works so well with the action
on
screen, and really helps the mood sway.  A masterpiece!
