Watching &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, you certainly get the feeling that Martin
Scorsese had wanted to make this movie for a long time. Thank God that
he finally got to; it was probably his best movie up to that time. It
shows the mafia world through the eyes of up-and-comer Henry Hill (Ray
Liotta). Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro) is Henry's main entry point into
the mafia, but Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) is also something else.
Needless to say, there is a LOT of violence (well duh; this movie's
about crime), but none of it gratuitous.<br /><br />You may have heard of Joe Pesci's &quot;How am I funny?&quot; speech. Let's just
say that you have to see it to believe it. In fact, you have to see the
whole movie to believe it. And to get a feeling of Martin Scorsese at
his best.
