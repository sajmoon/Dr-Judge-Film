Goodfellas may be one of the best films I've had the pleasure to sit and
enjoy in a movie theatre.  I've seen a lot of films, whether on home video
or in theatre's, but this may be the best.  I remember sitting mesmerized
for two hours and twenty minutes in a packed movie theatre in Buffalo, NY,
not wanting Scorsese's epic to end.  I truly believe this is the film his
early classic's were leading up to.  Goodfellas is a compilation in spirit
of Mean Streets, Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, combining elements from all
and the truly fascinating story of Henry Hill into Scorsese best film.  It
works on every level.  The story, acting, cinematography and editing are
equally brilliant.
In this busy day and age when its tough to manage the time to watch the
newest movie on video or in theatres I can still find time to watch
Goodfellas almost anytime.
