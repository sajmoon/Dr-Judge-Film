I just cant praise this movie enough! I love the Story, characters,
acting, directing and editing from start to finish! I love the dialogue
and almost documentary type of feeling you get from it. Who better than
Marty tro direct the movie especially when based on a real story. This
movie is much closer to the real story than Casion is(still a great
Movie)<br /><br />Also the soundtrack is great! I would suggest to get look for the songs
that do not appear on the soundtrack and also to read the book by
Nicholas Pileggi. There are some interesting thing that did'nt make it
into the movie! <br /><br />I'll rate this movie 10 out of 10!
