This movie is the highlight of everyone involved's careers, as far as I'm
concerned. Wonderful, masterful work. You don't even notice how long a
film
it is while watching it, as it's perfectly paced and edited. Ray Liotta is
underrated in his role, should've been an Oscar contender. This film is
the
rightful Best Picture of the Decade.
