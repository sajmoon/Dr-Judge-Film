No matter how many times you watch it, Goodfellas is one of those
movies which you just never grow out of. Arguably the best gangster
film of the decade (but I think of all time). Martin Scorsese is able
to generate just about every kind of tone a film could have; humorous,
touching, depressing, grim. This is superbly written and acted, and ten
times more down-to-Earth and involving than the Godfather. If there is
anyone out there who hasn&#x27;t seen Goodfellas.....see it.<br /><br />The first thing we see on screen are the words &#x27;The following is based
on a true story&#x27; or something like that. In the twenty first century,
those words are the hottest marketing gig going. Goodfellas was before
those days. Next we meet Henry Hill, who became a gangster at grade
school age, and went on to become hot stuff. He helped pull off the
famous Lufthansa heist, but did he and his buddies get away with it? <br /><br />Goodfellas is able to cover about three and a half decades in two
hours, without felling too slow or too fast. The story, is direct and
detailed, and allows the viewer to become &#x27;one of the boys&#x27;. Goodfellas
feels like a party almost, with an occasional ballroom brawl here and
there.<br /><br />I&#x27;m assuming because of its Oscar snub, that the film wasn&#x27;t very
popular when it was released, but of course brilliance doesn&#x27;t come
right away. It took years for the world to recognize just how
groundbreaking Citizen Kane was. No movie is perfect, but Goodfellas is
pretty close.
