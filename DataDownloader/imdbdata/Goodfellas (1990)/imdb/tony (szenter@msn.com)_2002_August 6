Goodfellas is an amazing gritty colorful and often darkly amusing look at
a
group of gangsters over a thirty year period.  Robert Deniro is perfect as
Jimmy the Gent, the more stable pro in the group.  Joe Pesci is well Joe
Pesci except in this particular film he gets to act out all his most
violent
fantasies.  Ray Liotta is also great as the seemingly detached gangster
whose amoral decisions and lifestyle never seem to register on his
conscience.  The movie is morally ambiguous but I still find myself
loathing
pesci's character for his insanely cruel behavior.  The film is very
stylish
and engaging which is good.   At the same time you see how really rotten
they are in the end. Lost word is its fantastic and an absolute mustsee!!!
Martin Scorseses is one of my favorite directors Raging Bull, Taxi Driver,
are also among my all time favorite movies.  See this film right
away!!
