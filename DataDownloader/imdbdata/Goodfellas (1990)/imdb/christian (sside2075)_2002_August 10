Goodfellas is an overrated gangster movie, kind of like the Godfather except
it's better. The movie might be overrated but I still like it. The story is
interesting, especially since it's true although I'm sure it's been quite
fictionalized to make a good movie. The acting in the movie is good
especially by Joe Pesci. He's a funny guy. So see this movie.
bye.
