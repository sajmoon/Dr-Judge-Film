Even Martin Scorcese imitated his own film with &quot;Casino&quot;. Quentin Tarantino,
Paul Thomas Anderson, and a host of other wannabes have imitated the tone,
the camera work and the style, but all they managed to do is imitate it.
&quot;Goodfellas&quot; set the tone for the Gen-X 90's mobster flick (previously
always done in the style of Coppola's more mannered &quot;The Godfather&quot;). Rather
than Italian music, it used 70's music like Sid Vicious and other
performers. Tarantino, Ritchie, and Anderson only wish they had Scorcese's
style. Unfortunately, Scorcese wishes he had this style these days,
too.
