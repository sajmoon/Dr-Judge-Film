Goodfellas is truly a masterpiece, and definitely the best piece of
directing Scorsese ever accomplished.<br /><br />This is such a fast paced movie, it will keep you on the edge of your
seat, at no point does this movie bore the audience. There are no bad
scenes, the whole movie just flows.<br /><br />What I loved about this movie, was it was an amazing movie version of
the book, almost 100% the same as the novel.<br /><br />And the story is just perfect to be made into a movie, it is a sad
story of the mafia.<br /><br />Usually I am not the biggest fan of the mafia movies, but this one is
just excellent because it is different then every other one. The first
act shows all the stereotypical Hollywood movie that merely glorifies
the mob, and then the 2nd act shows the evil side of the mafia.
