Martin Scorsese's &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is sheer brilliance. It is a film that
engages you deeply in the story and it's characters. Every aspect of the
film works. Nothing is out of place.<br /><br />Scorsese's directing is flawless. He fits everything in place perfectly.
The
narration through out the film also adds a very nice touch.<br /><br />The acting is all superb. Ray Liotta portrays Henry Hill with just enough
edge and fire. It is probably his finest performance to date. Robert
DeNiro
as Jimmy Conway is compelling and strong. He gives a top notch
performance
as always. Now I come to Joe Pesci who completely deserved his best
supporting actor Oscar for this film. He puts so much in his role as
Tommy
DeVito. Whenever Pesci is on the screen he steals the show.<br /><br />&quot;Goodfellas&quot; is one the finest movies ever made. It is a true classic.
