Goodfellas is Martin Scorsese&#39;s best film. Joe Pesci won Best
Supporting Actor for his role as Tommy. This movie has great drama and
humor. Robert De Niro did a good job, Ray Liotta did a good job and
Lorraine Bracco also did a job. This movie is emotional. Martin
Scorsese is one of the greatest directors of all time. This movie got
cut to avoid an NC-17 rating. This movie has graphic language and
graphic violence. This movie is a masterpiece. This movie had a great
script. This movie made me laugh too. Movies like this need humor. This
movie is based on the novel Wiseguy. This movie is Joe Pesci&#39;s best
movie. He deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this.
