1999_February 15 

This movie, to me, is what mafia life was all about.  It didn't
over-dramatize anything.  The language, the ruthlessness, the lack of trust;
this was a great film.  I especially liked the aspect of how that the main
character was taken from being a young boy through his life into the
present.  I liked the aspect of how that they were close knit.  To me, it
was kinda like a little anthropology study of a strange type of community.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone that is interested in what life in
the mafia is truly like.  It may seem graphic, but that is what makes it
good.  There is no sugarcoating.  On the other hand, they don't dramatize it
to the point of losing its luster either.  It is a 10.
