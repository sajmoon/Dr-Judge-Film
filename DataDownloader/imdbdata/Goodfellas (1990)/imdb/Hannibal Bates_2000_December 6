2000_December 6 

&quot;Goodfellas&quot; is a perfect film. You have it all. Brilliant, acting,
directing &amp; writing. How this film didn't beat out &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; for
Best Picture is the 8th mystery of the world. The sudden violence is brutal
yet so poetic. But there is one big mistake people make about this film. In
the Robert DeNiro video collection, you get &quot;Mean Streets,&quot; &quot;Raging Bull&quot; &amp;
&quot;Goodfellas.&quot; That's wrong. That's saying &quot;Goodfellas&quot; (like many other
people say) is DeNiro's movie. But, it's not (&quot;Taxi Driver&quot; should've been
the 3rd flick in the set). &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is the director's film (If you don't
who it is, you should be ashamed) &amp; Henry Hill's film. Ray L. give his
career performance. I must say that after watching this and comparing it to
his other works. His career has been a waste. Liotta should have walked away
with an Oscar for his performance of Henry Hill. He was beyond perfect. But
the greatest thing here is how Scorsese made this oh so violent story into
one of, if not the greatest dark comedy, ever.
10 out of 10.
