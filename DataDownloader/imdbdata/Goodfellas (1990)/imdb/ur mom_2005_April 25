I don't know if I am just a wacko but I love these violent films. The
way directors and actors like Scorcese, DeNiro, and Pesci display
violence is so beautiful and artistic. One of my favorite shots in the
film is when DeNiro is stomping and kicking some guy. I love it! I
replay it overand over and watch it again and again. To see the
expression on DeNiro's face and the way he moves. The way these actors
embody the Mafioso image is spectacular. Scorcese makes art in these
films because of the ordering of art. He makes the talent of other
people shine and makes it his. The soundtrack, the acting, and the
imagery is all blended in together to make beautiful films like
Goodfellas, a movies that you can watch over and over and over and
over...
