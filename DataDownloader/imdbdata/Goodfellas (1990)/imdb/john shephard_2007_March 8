2007_March 8 
Here in Crete Greece there are many films shown during the night on TV
so my wife and I use the users comments to decide which films to record
to watch at a decent hour. This film being 19th in the top 250 film was
a must to record.<br /><br />Without a doubt this is a well made film, with atmospheric photography
and very good acting. The violence which we saw although harsh was
artistic and thus a bit detached from reality. In fact we found the
style of the film rather too artistic and atmospheric and after a 40
minutes we looked at each other and agreed we were bored by it. We
could not relate to any or the characters in the film nor did we care
what happened to them. So we turned it off and deleted it to make space
for another film.
