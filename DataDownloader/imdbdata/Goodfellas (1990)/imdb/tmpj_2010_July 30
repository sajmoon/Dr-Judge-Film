When &#x22;Goodfellas&#x22; was in theatrical release, I did not see it. I was
having a fit of &#x22;cinematic malaise&#x22;...there simply were not a whole
heck of a lot of good flicks coming out during that time, and the slew
of street thug movies actually made it somewhat dangerous to venture
out into theaters in some cities. A lot of us said &#x22;to hell with it&#x22;
and decided to concentrate on our own VHS collections and catch up on
films when they became available for rent or purchase. Consequently, I
did not see &#x22;Goodfellas&#x22; until 1999. I&#x27;d heard about the film, and I
must say my own legs were not long enough to kick myself in the rear
for waiting so long to see it. And this was just one of the films I had
to catch up with...there were a number of others. I did not think that
this film could top most of the other mob-type films that had already
been made. I was wrong. The film was engrossing form the outset. Joe
Pesci was loud and scary...and Paul Sorvino was relatively quiet and
scary...in a way that was more menacing and perhaps more disturbing
than Pesci...which was acting that took quite a bit of doing. I was
rather roughed up at some of the language and the racial
references...it took me a while to reconcile this...they were products
of the times. One thing that caught my eye--and ear--was that Scorsese
kept the imagery in a kind of 1960s mode. No long sideburns or long
haircuts. No dog-eared shirts...no wide neck-ties or lapels. This hurt
the film from a standpoint of making it flow with time...but the
performances and the characters help to overcome this.<br /><br />The story is very well told, and Scorsese does it masterfully. One can
see that he had a direct influence on Tarantino, especially when the
film opens with the murder of a &#x22;made man&#x22; in the mob...a story that we
return to much later in the film. Tarantino borrowed that style and
essentially made it his own. Pesci re-defined the definition of a
madman in a screen performance of a character who did not live to the
end of the film...but yet will not die. Sorvinos broad range has seen
him playing such diverse characters as Bible-thumping fundamentalist
ministers...even a rape victim. But his stature as a tough guy is
secure...one glance from those steely eyes can penetrate the audience,
and you can see Perdition itself through it all. Bob De Niro plays, of
all things, a character who is only half-Italian, which would
dis-qualify him from becoming a &#x22;made man&#x22; for the mob no matter what
he does. His, too, is a very broad spectrum. I have a few reservations
about recommending the film 100%. It is very realistic, very graphic
and very violent. But, seldom is the truth a very pretty thing to look
at. See Goodfellas...if you haven;t already. If you have...see it
again. It is part of my collection now.
