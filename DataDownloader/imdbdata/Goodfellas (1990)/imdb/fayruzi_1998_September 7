1998_September 7 

This film is a instant classic. It documents the life of Henry Hill and how
he got into being part of the Mob. The amazing thing is that it's no
fiction, even if it was, it's still beautiful. It's based on a book called
Wiseguy written by Nicholas Pileggi. He met the real Henry Hill and made his
story into a best selling book. Scorsese worked with Pileggi after liking
the fast pace of the book, and they wrote the script. It was developed into
this film. Casting is another great thing about the film, it seems that all
the actors fit perfectly in their roles. It also has some really funny
bits. Pileggi worked with Scorsese on another great Mob film, Casino.
