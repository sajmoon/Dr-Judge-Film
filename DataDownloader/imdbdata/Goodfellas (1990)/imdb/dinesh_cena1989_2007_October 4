The movie is Goodfellas. The geniuses who made it, Martin Scorsese and
Nicholas Pileggi. The outcome: Successful.<br /><br />Plot: (True story). Henry Hill and his two close mobster friends, Jimmy
and Tommy become the huge players in the punk-like tiny
Italian-American gangster community in New York at the time.<br /><br />List of main characters Henry Hill: The engine the movie runs on. Hill
is Italian-American with Irish blood. Ray Liotta, in my eyes, then a
newcomer, sets me at storm. His performance is top-notch and yet he
looks like he doesn&#39;t care, this &#39;effortless&#39; quality that Ray possess
is great and exciting.<br /><br />Jimmy Conway: De Niro&#39;s character is the at times sick, at times
bubbly. This is a character with no set behavior pattern. De Niro
catches it with great attitude.<br /><br />Tommy DeVito: Joe Pesci&#39;s character swears and kills people with his
gun as ignorantly as taking a cookie out of jar. He kills people
willingly and when they make him mad for the simplest reason. An
amazing, entertaining work.<br /><br />Paul Cicero: &quot;Paulie&quot; is the one man who gives protection to wiseguys
from law enforcement. So in return, he gets a part of the wiseguys&#39;
share and their respect as well. On the DVD, Paul Sorvino claims he
found the quality that his character needed in his eyes when he went to
the mirror to check for spinach in his teeth. (lol..) Karen Hill: The
wife of Henry Hill. She&#39;s a very naive-like woman but grows depressed
and frustrated with Henry towards the end. She is innocent and is
unaware of Henry&#39;s affairs with Janice Rozzi and Sandy, who
participates in Henry&#39;s drug business in the movie.<br /><br />Martin Scorsese melds amazing little things together in this movie that
form a masterpiece. Frankly, I never thought the piano part of Derek
And The Dominos&#39; LAYLA would fit in a mobster movie. Indeed, it was one
of the many reasons why only Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s The Godfather is
the only movie that is greater than this one. A must-see.<br /><br />8/10: A-
