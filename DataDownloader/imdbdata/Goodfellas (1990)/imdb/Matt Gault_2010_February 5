---May contain spoilers---<br /><br />I had heard so may positive things about Goodfellas and had read so
many reviews, so when i sat down a couple of nights ago, I was
expecting nothing short of a masterful depiction of gangster life, what
i watched didn&#x27;t not fall short of my high expectations. The film
centres on Henry Hill, portrayed by Ray Liotta, who gradually moves up
the ranks in the organised crime scene in New York and eventually
becomes on the most respected, feared and loved gangsters in the city.
Scorsese is flawless in evoking the consequences of becoming embroiled
in the deeply exciting yet wholly damaging dynamics of gangster life.
The film is wonderfully directed by Scorsese in this regard and also in
the depths of characterisation that are apparent in the film. Examples
of this include the friendliness yet relentless ruthlessness shown by
Jimmy Conway (played by a wonderfully convincing Robert De Niro) Joe
Pesci, perhaps, steals the show with his chilling yet hugely amusing
portrayal of Tommy DeVito with whom he transcends a brilliant mix of
violence and humour. is efforts with this character were deservedly
recognised with an Academy Award for Acot in a supporting role. In my
opinion, the films most engaging and powerful element is the spiral out
of control that Henry Hill experiences when he indulges in drug use and
infidelities. The film also seems to flow effortlessly from scene to
scene which makes the 146 minute running time seem a lot shorter.<br /><br />10/10. A great effort from Scorsese, his directing was awe-inspired,
and Liotta, De Niro and Pesci combined produce a fantastic ensemble of
gangster characters.
