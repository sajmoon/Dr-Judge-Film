Quite simply one of the greatest movies of all time, the Deniro
Scorcese partnership in full flow Pesci is absolute genius Liota
inspired,and Sorvino well it was the role he was born to play. The
casting is inspired the editing the best in Film history and the
narrating even inspired the Shawshank redemption. Its iconic, slick,
cool, over violent and sickening all screwed into one great movie.
There&#39;s really nothing else that need be said about this film which is
perhaps the greatest ever and in my opinion far superior to the great
yet overrated godfather. It&#39;s just absolutely flawless, and if pushed
to find one i&#39;d say its the fact that the budget isn&#39;t large enough
