Goodfellas is a masterpiece of the life of a gangster. Through 4o years,
Henry Hill develops as a gangster and as does Ray Liotta's character. The
credulous plot and acting given by Robert De Niro and Joe Pasci, who won
an
Oscar for his part in the film, makes this film a must see for any
gangster
flick loving person. If you liked this movie, you should check out King of
New York, The Godfather, Once Upon a Time in America, and Empire.
