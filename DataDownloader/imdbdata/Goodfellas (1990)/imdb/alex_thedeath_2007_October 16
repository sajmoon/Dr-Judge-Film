i think this is the best gangsters movie ever. the actors are hand
picked from the best, and if it warren for Robert De Niro the film
wouldn&#39;t be the same, Robert De Niro is a must have in a gangsters
movie. the language isn&#39;t censored in any way fact that added to the
film&#39;s goodness. good work goodfellas ;) if only they would have made a
sequel to it to, that would have been perfect wouldn&#39;t it. p.s. if you
wanna see another good gangsters movie i recommend you casino ...
Robert De Niro is the best!!;) and if you didn&#39;t see the film yet you
don&#39;t know what your missing. Whit all the respect Alex from Romania:D
Goodfellas rocks!!!
