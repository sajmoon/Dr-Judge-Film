Martin Scorcese's compelling 'Goodfellas' is arguably his most entertaining
film.  It's accomplishments include a strong but believable narrative, a
loving recreation of two decades of New York life in music and images
(including some famously stunning elongated tracking shots), and great
performances, in particular from Joe Peschi as the psychopathic killer Tommy
and Paul Sorvino as a mafia boss.  Yet its watchability is also its
weakness.  Central character Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) narrates throughout,
smoothing together the strands of the story but also telling us how to
interpret it and thus distancing us from the action.  The film lacks the
visceral intimacy of 'Raging Bull' (or, indeed, the subversiveness of 'Taxi
Driver' or 'The King of Comedy'), while, for example, the emotional impact
of the scenes where Henry realises the mob is out to kill him is slight
compared with, say, the similar scenes concerning Al Pacino's character in
'Donnie Brasco'. It's almost impossible to dislike this film, because we are
led through it so adeptly, but at a certain level, it's little more than a
well-spun yarn, proof perhaps that a master reaches the height of his
technical powers somewhat later than the peak of his imagination.  Enjoy it,
but the early stuff is better.
