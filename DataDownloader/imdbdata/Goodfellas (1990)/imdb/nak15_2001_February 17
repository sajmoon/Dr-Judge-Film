Though the cinematography and performances were excellent, the film suffered
from a musical score that was disjointed, out of place and distraction from
the quality of the film.  The cinematography in this film was so amazing
that it made want to cry, this film had some amazing shots, which alone make
this film something everyone who has a love of film should see.  However,
the music in the film is a collection of great classic rock songs, which
alone are great songs, but are too loud and seem to be disjointed from the
scenes which is very distracting.  It might be worth it to watch this film
with no volume.
