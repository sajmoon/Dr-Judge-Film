I&#39;ll be the first to admit that I&#39;m not a &quot;mob&quot; or &quot;gangster&quot; movie
fan, I find the movies to have dragged-out dialog and its length to
exceeds its limit, the characters nor theme have really taken much
interest in me. But Goodfellas certainly did surpass, it was certainly
a real enjoyable movie to watch. There was excellent characters, fine
acting from; Robert De Nero, Ray Liotta and the real stand-out is Joe
Pesci. De Nero and Scorsese again teamed up to deliver a good movie
with excellent story-telling. To me, Goodfellas is no masterpiece, I&#39;ll
always be one to have an average view on these type of movies (mods,
gangsters, mafias etc.), but according to others the movie really
doesn&#39;t disappoint. Find out for yourself.
