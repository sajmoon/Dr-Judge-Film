This movie was great!  It really kept you off of your seat!  These gangsters
made you think that they were your best friend when really they were
planning on killing you the same day!  Robert De Nero is great at being a
gangster as always!  Probably because he has been one is so many movies it
comes naturally.  Joe Pesci wasn't too bad either.  I have to say I liked De
Nero though the best!  He is one of my favorite actors!  This was probably
one of the best gangster movies I have ever seen!
