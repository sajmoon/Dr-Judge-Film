This movie is about despicable characters committing deplorable acts
yet it manages to be interesting if overlong, with too much time spent
establishing the gangster lifestyle that we already know about from
films such as &quot;The Godfather.&quot; Once it gets going about half way
through, however, it becomes rather compelling. Scorsese is the master
of this sort of film, although his trademark obsession with violence is
disturbing. De Niro plays the same character that he has played in a
dozen movies. Although there are no likable characters, Pesci&#39;s is the
worst. Bracco is sexy. Liotta is creepy-looking. This one probably
holds the record for the number of f-words uttered.
