1999_August 31 

I remember being fourteen when I first saw this movie and at seventeen, it
still remains to be my best movie to date.<br /><br />Brilliantly directed by Scorsese we are taken through three decades of
life
in the Mafia through the eyes of young Henry Hill. Unlike most movies
which
gloss over the harshness of reality, this movie shows us the truth with no
shame.  Scorsese presents us with a powerful story of violence, crime,
romance, revenge and betrayal.<br /><br />We are presented with characters so incredibly bad that we fall in love
with
them straight away.  The most memorable being the four leads played by Ray
Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracco.<br /><br />There are amazing cameos and an incredible fifties, sixties and seventies
sound track which carries the mood of the movie throughout.<br /><br />This is what a gangster movie should be, entertaining, visually a
masterpiece and have top notch acting.<br /><br />GoodFellas has it all and I give it 10/10 without any hesitation
whatsoever.<br /><br />How can you not appreciate a movie which has such classic scenes such as
where Pesci and Liotta are sitting around a table in a restaurant arguing
over what makes Pesci so funny?!?<br /><br />
