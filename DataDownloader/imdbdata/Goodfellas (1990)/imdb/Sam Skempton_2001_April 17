Everything about this film is brilliant. The film moves at a fast
pace
and as a result remains entertaining and utterly compelling
throughout.
The rock and pop soundtrack which is evident throughout most of the
film
keeps the pace up, as does Scorcese's energetic direction. The<br /><br />performances (by De niro and Pesci in particular) are stunning, making<br /><br />even the most violent characters strangely appealing. If you
haven't
seen this film then you are missing out the greatest gangster film
ever
made and one that you will want to see again and again.
