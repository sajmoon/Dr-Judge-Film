This movie was excellent in terms of what Scorese wanted his audience
to see. The way the mafia world works and how different it is in terms
of normal everyday life. The start of the movie was brilliant and done
in a way a mafia movie should be done, with a bit of violence. The
scenes in the movie were beautifully constructed and shot, like the
time Henry takes Karen out to the restaurant and Henry introduces the
mafia members, like Johnny 2 time because he says everything twice.
During this whole scene the camera doesn't cut which is a piece of
brilliance from Scorese as it makes you feel as though you are a part
of the mafia family. The acting in the movie is brilliant, Ray Liotta,
Robert de Niro and the brilliant and funny Joe Pesci, also Paul Sorvino
should not go unnoticed for his part. What I found incredible is that
the academy failed to reward Scorese for his work in this movie and
they still have not today even with The Aviator. Personally I feel this
is a great injustice to a great man who has opened say many doors for
the future of film.
