GoodFellas is so good for so many reasons. The acting, directing and
writing
is flawless, not to mention the classic Scorsese soundtrack which only
adds
to the the picture's greatness. I've seen the film countless times and
after
every viewing I appreciate it that much more. It should go down as one of
the best films ever made.  Scorsese has done it again!
