Henry Hill small town gangsters errand boy who makes it
big.
Great film plenty of blood and guts and full of great wit,
love the bit about the wife who turns a blind eye when things are good then
can't understand when things go wrong.
The film is frantic and fast moving and you are never board.
I suggest you watch and find out for yourself just how good it
is.
Not just another gangster film.
