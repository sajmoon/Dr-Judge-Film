I loved this movie! It was a so real depiction of mob life on the small time
going up to the big time. Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Lorraine Bracco and
Paul Sorvino were great. Joe Pesci did a great job too but I'll admit that
before the movie was over I wanted to &quot;whack&quot; his character because he
grated on my nerves so much, Pesci pulled it off completely. The is a well
scripted, superbly executed movie. Liotta was devine. Lorraine Bracco makes
you realize how a woman can fall in love with a mobster. This is a rare must
see movie. Ray Liotta's best. The dialouge was quick and memorable.
Everything was memorable. One caution- the F word gets big time play so if
it affends you be warned.
