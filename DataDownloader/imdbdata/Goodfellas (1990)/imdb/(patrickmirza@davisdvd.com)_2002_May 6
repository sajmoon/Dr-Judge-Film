I'll keep this simple: Goodfellas is quite simply the greatest film of the
1990s. I knew that when I saw it in the theaters and I still feel that way
12 years later. This film is one of Scorsese's crowning achievements, and
with his filmography that's saying a lot.<br /><br />Acting, camera work, editing, music placement and on and on... I marvel at
the craftsmanship every time I see this film. I only wish there was a
rating
higher than &quot;10&quot; to give Goodfellas.
