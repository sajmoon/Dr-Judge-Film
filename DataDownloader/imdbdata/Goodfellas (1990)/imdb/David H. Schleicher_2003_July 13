If you hate mob movies, or hate Scorsese, then you probably won&#39;t be
able to sit through this. But for the rest of us out there, this is
arguably one of the best films of the 1990&#39;s, possibly one of the best
of all time, and without a doubt one of the most influential films of
the past twenty years. Every mob movie/underworld saga/generational
tale/crime thriller from &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; to &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; to &quot;Blow&quot;
(which played like the TV movie version of a great Scorsese flick) to
TV&#39;s &quot;The Sopranos&quot; owes a debt to this film. Scorsese was at the top
of his game here, and what makes this film stand tall above all other
movies of this ilk (including Scorsese&#39;s own &quot;Casino&quot;--a great film in
its own right) is that there is an overwhelming visceral charge to the
film that makes it all seem so enjoyable despite the onslaught of
blood, foul language, and unsavory activities. You are made to believe
that these gangsters were having the time of their lives. So too were
Scorsese and pals in making the film. And lastly, so too are we the
audience in watching it all. Everything came together in this film so
perfectly the viewer is left feeling oddly giddy amongst all the true
life bloodshed. This sense of &quot;fun&quot; is the one thing that his recent
&quot;Gangs of New York&quot; was missing, and may be what keeps that film from
being ranked as one of the all time greats.<br /><br />As for the acting, Pesci is all at once hilarious and scary. De Niro is
at his best. And Liotta gives a career defining performance (only in
the recent &quot;Narc&quot; has he been able to recapture some of this magic). <br /><br />As for some of the finer details, I dare you to find a movie that makes
better use of popular music or Steady-cam shots. The cinematography,
editing, set designs and costumes (that traverse the varied stylings of
the 1950&#39;s , 60&#39;s, 70&#39;s and early 80&#39;s) are all pitch perfect. Is there
a better scene than when Liotta takes Lorraine Braco to the Copacabana
for the first time and introduces her to the perks of gangster life
while &quot;And Then he Kissed Me&quot; plays on the soundtrack? Will you ever be
able to listen to &quot;Layla&quot; without thinking about mob hits and a frozen
body in a meat truck? <br /><br />All these things, a communion with the audience (here we share
Scorsese&#39;s joy both in making a film and in our watching it), top-notch
production values, great performances, and a lasting influence on later
films are the earmarks of a great movie, the pinnacle of a great
director&#39;s career, and one of the greatest films of all time.
&quot;Goodfellas&quot; may never reach the mythical status &quot;The Godfather&quot; saga
did, but as great films like this are becoming few and far in between,
it makes you believe in the myth of the &quot;greatest film of all time.&quot;
Maybe it is, most likely it isn&#39;t, but we the audience for a brief
moment, maybe for just one scene, are pretty much convinced THIS IS IT.
