Maybe it was I watched the amazing second part of the godfather right
before this movie, but I thought this was not as good as most people
made it out to be. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is an excellent film. It&#x27;s
one of the top mafia films I have ever seen.<br /><br />This is the story of one guy and how he spent his life since childhood
in the mafia.<br /><br />The acting is superb. I was pleased at the performances by Ray Liotta,
Robert De Niro, and especially Joe Pesci as the wild maniac. This also
has to be Martin Scorcese&#x27;s finest.<br /><br />One thing that bothered me here is there was no score, just pop songs.
I liked the songs but I expected a score similar to the Godfather. I
was disappointed there but that&#x27;s pretty much my only disappointment.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good gangster film. I recommend this to people
who like these kind of films but it&#x27;s also very violent. I rate this
film 8/10.
