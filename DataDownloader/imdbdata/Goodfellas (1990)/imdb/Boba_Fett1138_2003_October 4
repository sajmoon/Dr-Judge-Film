Movies don&#x27;t get any better then this!<br /><br />The problem with gangster movies is that it always will be compared to
the brilliant &#x22;Godfather&#x22; movies. Often when you do that you come to
the conclusion that it&#x27;s a very bad movie, however &#x22;Goodfellas&#x22; doesn&#x27;t
suffer from this curse. It&#x27;s just as genius and at some points even
better as the &#x22;Godfather&#x22; movies.<br /><br />That it&#x27;s based on true events also makes the movie interesting to
watch. Rarely has the live of a gangster been portrayed so wonderfully
and interesting. The story is told in a wonderful way without getting
boring for a single second. Who didn&#x27;t wanted to be a gangster for a
day after seeing this movie ???<br /><br />Next to the story there are three other truly great things about the
movie: The cast, the characters and the dialogue. The cast is full with
famous actor that all have been cast perfectly. Joe Pesci of course
truly steals the show and it&#x27;s no wonder he won a Oscar for his role.
The famous &#x22;You think I&#x27;m funny?&#x22; scene with him is brilliant and
amuses me every time, it truly is one of the best scene&#x27;s of all time.
A real classic! But let&#x27;s not forget Ray Liotta and Robert De Niro who
also give an amazing performance. Same goes for Catherine Scorsese as
Joe Pesci&#x27;s character Tommy&#x27;s mother. She plays really natural and lot
of fun scene&#x27;s with great dialogue are the result. The wonderful
stereotype gangster characters also add to this movie. How can you not
like characters such as Frankie Carbone, Edward Stacks, Johnny two
times, Morrie or Vinnie who puts too much tomatoes in the sauce. The
movie is full with sharp and sometimes cruel but funny dialogue. All
this things combined makes this a classic and magnificent movie, a
movie that you MUST have at least seen once in your lifetime.<br /><br />The movie is full with many great long scene&#x27;s. Some of the longest I
have ever seen. Most of those long scene&#x27;s are the highlight of the
movie. Great directing from Martin Scorsese!<br /><br />Although it&#x27;s a quite heavy movie it actually is also for some reason a
fun movie to watch over and over again without getting ever boring.<br /><br />Nothing short of brilliant! A must see for everyone.<br /><br />10/10<br /><br />http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/
