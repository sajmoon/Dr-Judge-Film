1999_February 13 

Scorsese is a genius.With Goodfellas, he demonstrates his full command of
the medium. He uses every technique at his disposal to tell his story. He uses
the camera like an artist uses a paint brush. With the use of voice over
narration,freeze frame, long tracking shots,flawless editing and popular
music to accentuate the atmosphere of each scene,he creates a
masterpiece.He gets great performances from all his actors with an
outstanding performance by Joe Pesci. Scorsese does a fabulous job of
creating the feel of urgency and paranoia in the final segment. I don't think
there is another director on the planet that could have translated the
source material onto the screen as effectively as Scorsese has. A superb film
in every respect.
