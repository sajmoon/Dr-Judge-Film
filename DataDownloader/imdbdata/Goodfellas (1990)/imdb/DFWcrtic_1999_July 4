1999_July 4 

With &quot;Goodfellas,&quot; master director Martin Scorsese establishes himself as
one of the all-time great filmmakers. Certainly the best film of his
career,
&quot;Goodfellas&quot; is flawlessly written, produced, edited, acted, and
[especially] directed. Scorsese gets excellent performances from the
remarkable Ray Liotta and the various supporting cast members. Robert
DeNiro, in what may well be the role of his career, plays an Irish gangster
destined to forever hover on the outer fringes of the Mob--and, by
extension, self-acceptance. Truly, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is destined to join such
cinematic milestones as &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and &quot;2001&quot; as one of the finest
films
of all time.
