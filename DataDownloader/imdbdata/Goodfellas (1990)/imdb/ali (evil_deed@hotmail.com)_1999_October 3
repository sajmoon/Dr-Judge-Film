  Goodfellas is one of the best movies of the decade.  Scorcese and De Niro
are the greatest director/actor combo since Ford and Wayne.  De Niro is
dynamic.  Pesci is perfect.  And Scorsese is a scorcher.  The trio are the
heart of this motion picture.  Liotta is just a loose artery.  Pesci could
wack Kicking Bird any day and that's why he won the best supporting actor
oscar, hands down.  The soundtrack is one of the best ever made, it should
be sung in Church.  Scorsese is one of those directors that doesn't get any
recognition from the Academy Awards (he should have won best director for
Raging Bull).  Ray Liotta is average at best (he made a more appealing
Shoeless Joe in &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;).  Lorraine Bracco is stunning, her acting
has always been solid.  That is why she is receiving rave reviews for The
Soprano's.  If you want a great movie rent something else, but if you want a
high-octane action packed mesmerizing masterpiece you might want to pick up
Goodfellas.  P.S. write me if agree, write to the person who reviewed the
movie right above me is you disagree.  email me for any movie suggestions,
they don't call me the &quot;tree of knowledge&quot; for nothing.
