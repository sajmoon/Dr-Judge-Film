1999_February 2 

&quot;Goodfellas&quot; has a good story, and there are some really great camera shots
and edits that are characteristic of Mr. Scorsese.  However, I didn't like
it as well as, say, &quot;Raging Bull&quot;.  For one thing, I thought that some of
the violence was a little bit unnecessary.  Now I know that the main
characters are not heroes, but are anti-heroes.  But I still think that there
were some parts that were unnecessary - in particular, the part where Tommy
mercilessly shoots the poor kid in the bar.
However, in addition to the artistic shots and editing, the film also
had some really memorable dialogue.  And there was some great acting,
especially from DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta.  So, I wouldn't say that
this film is a perfect 10, but I guess I'll give it a 7.5.  Although a
little violent, it is a film I wouldn't mind seeing again.
