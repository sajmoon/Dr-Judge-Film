&quot;Goodfellas&quot; is a very dark, harsh film that actually manages to
glorify gangsters. Director Martin Scorcese shows an obsession for the
characters and the extraordinary lives they lead. New boy Henry Hill is
played well by Ray Liotta, while long-time wise guys Jimmy Conway and
Tommy De Vito are played brilliantly by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci
respectively.<br /><br />Scorcese shines throughout as he manages to entertain, and keep the
audience interested, for over two hours.<br /><br />Another great, powerful gangster movie. Be aware &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is a
violent film, yet by today&#39;s standards, perhaps not so anymore.<br /><br />Sunday, March 3, 1991 - Village Southland
