Martin Scorsese&#39;s Goodfellas is quintessentially one of the greatest
movies ever. It is better than The Godfather in my opinion because of
its real life approach to mob life. The film follows Henry Hill as he
is brought into the mob life at a young age and how it brings him down
at the end. The movie is just amazing to watch as it is like watching a
documentary on the what is like to be in the mob. Adding to it are the
amazing performances put forth by Ray Liotta as Henry,Robert De Niro as
his friend Jimmy the Gent who is great in it and Lorraine Bracco who is
very good as Henry&#39;s wife. But the performance worth mentioning is Joe
Pesci&#39;s awesome performance as Tommy De Vito. His acting in it is one
of the best performances I&#39;ve ever seen. The film follows a time line
from the 1950&#39;s to the 1980&#39;s and with it accompanies one of the
greatest soundtracks ever put together. Scorcese has a knack for
putting great soundtracks together and this is one of the greatest he&#39;s
ever produced. Goodfellas is one of the greatest movies ever and one of
Scorsese&#39;s all time best.
