2010_September 20 
1990 was a decent year for movies. We have the now-Christmas classic
Home Alone, tear-jerker classic Ghost, several decent action-packed
flicks (Hunt for Red October, Total Recall, Die Hard 2, Steven Segal
before he became ridiculous), and of course, Rocky V (totally kidding).
But, 20 years ago, there was one movie that truly rose up amongst the
usual pile of movies and delivered one of the most exhilarating
experiences in the history of cinema. Goodfellas is a masterpiece of
its genre, and would change the movie world forever. It was too intense
for some, but if you can rise past the grittiness, you are in for a
wild ride through the drugs, violence, humor, and money associated with
life in the gangsterhood. This movie would change a genre forever, and
would pave the way for several promising careers.<br /><br />Much like the way Sergio Leone (and eventually Clint Eastwood) made
classic westerns (For a Few Dollars More being my favorite) that made
all the other westerns made at the time inferior, Goodfellas made The
Godfather and all crime/mafia pictures look silly. That&#x27;s right, I said
it. Godfather is a decent flick, but it is no Goodfellas. Nowadays,
whenever you make a gangster movie, you aren&#x27;t borrowing details or
techniques of Coppola, you are copying good ol&#x27; Martin Scorsese and his
masterful directing style associated with this flick. Even television
shows have a lot to owe to Goodfellas--&#x97;The Sorpranos features over 25
actors and actresses that were in the movie. Easily the best film from
1990, and easily the best crime-film of all-time.<br /><br />Goodfellas follows the lives of several gangsters and their families
throughout multiple decades, as you see their rise and fall in terms of
position, power, and money. All of this is being narrated by the main
character, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta). What separates Goodfellas from
every mafia/gangster film before and since its release is its very
humble, down-to-earth presentation of its story. While The Godfather
made the mafia life a larger-than-life event with a God-complex,
Goodfellas toned it down and made it look like a gritty, blue-collar
lifestyle that pays well and provides plenty of benefits. Also, unlike
all gangster films at the time, Goodfellas didn&#x27;t just focus on the
main players, but also focused on the wives, mistresses, kids, and
families of the gangsters involved. It was a family affair, and this
was a realization that Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi clearly pointed
out in their excellent script full of crisp diologue and plenty of
substance.<br /><br />Another great thing about Goodfellas is that gangsters, bosses,
villains were all given a heavy dosage of human character. They were
all people you can relate to, they weren&#x27;t just existing and talking to
progress the plot, they engaged in deep conversations about subjects
that were not always related to their job. When the audience can
associate themselves with the people in the film, it&#x27;s a great
connection, and few films can connect better than Goodfellas. It never
feels like a film that is 146 minutes long.<br /><br />Complimenting the superb writing was the phenomenal acting. Every
single performance was excellent, from the small (Samuel L. Jackson) to
the much bigger roles (Joe Pesci, Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta). The
excellent cast of actors and actresses contributed mightily to the
powerfulness, and the humbleness of the movie, as it humanized the
lifestyles of mobs, gangsters, and the mafia. Even the rampaging
murderer Joe Pesci portrayed was likable because despite his rage and
murderous attitude, you can still feel his admiration and care for some
of the people around him.<br /><br />But the standout feature of Goodfellas has got to be the phenomenal
directing of Martin Scorsese. Prior to Goodfellas, there was not a
single director that perfectly mixes long shots, close-ups,
track-shots, freeze-frames, long takes, and gritty hand-held-like
cinematography like Scorsese. The movie lacked the long, artsy,
pointless sweeping shots of most gangster films before 1990; not a
single shot or scene of Goodfellas was unnecessary. For example the
wedding scene of the first Godfather went on for too long because of
its constant shots of the wedding events; now compare that to the epic
long tracking shot of the main character entering the Copacabana. The
action and the mayhem was always close-up, sometimes with a gun pointed
directly at the camera, as if it was right on your face.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you enjoy a good film, then Goodfellas is for you. If
you have not seen it, you are missing out on one of the greatest
displays of perfect directing in the history of film, and easily the
best crime film you&#x27;ll ever witness. From the writing to the acting to
the music selected to the flawless mix of style and substance,
Goodfellas set the bar much higher for films of its kind, and all adult
films overall. It&#x27;s one of the first modern Hollywood films to not have
that Hollywood touch; as it remains down-to-earth, and allowed for a
similar R-rated crime masterpiece (Pulp Fiction) to flourish a couple
of years later.<br /><br />While the general public usually ranks The Godfather as the
quintessential crime film, I am one of the few that will safely say
that The Godfather is overrated, and it&#x27;s because movies like
Goodfellas exist. This film is very realistic, very intense, and full
of so many spectacular moments, you&#x27;ll need multiple viewings to truly
embellish yourself in it all. This movie is literally only one scene
away from cinematic perfection (the infamous Last Day as a Wiseguy
scene ran just a bit too long). I strongly recommend this movie, as it
will change the way you watch movies. And if you are aspiring to be in
the film industry, it will change the way you make them.
