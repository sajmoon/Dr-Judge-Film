Now, for a fact Goodfellas is NOT the best gangster film ever.  All three
Godfathers and Once Upon A Time In America are so blatantly superior.
Goodfellas is all style over substance and cartoon violence.  Do you ever
like or feel for the characters in the film? No, whereas in the Godfather
you know each of the characters and their emotions.  Goodfellas simply tries
too hard to be hip and cool, but to little avail.  The voice overs are
cliched and the plot very thin.  The characters are so one dimensional and
cold.  This film is not even in the same universe as the immense Godfather
films.  That is why they are rated 1 and 3 while Goodfellas is number 27.
Goodfellas = as cold as ice  Godfather = hot as hell.  FACT.  End of
discussion.
