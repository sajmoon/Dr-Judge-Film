2011_August 7 
This was so bad we didn&#x27;t watch it. The rating was PG so I got it for
my daughter. Within the first couple of minutes God&#x27;s name was used in
vain. The cursing kept coming. The scene in which Paulie, Jimmy and the
other hoods congratulate the boy Henry for taking his first pinch like
a man! That is a very harsh and rough method to rub in the disturbing
fact that these role models of HH are all pendejos=a------s with no
morals, no ethics and absolutely nothing but the most deformed and
grotesque values and principles. My infant daughter asked to stop the
movie. It was uncomfortable and just plain bad.<br /><br />I bequeth it only a second star as Scorsese went on to redeem himself
with The Imparted, Shutter Island, and Cocoon.
