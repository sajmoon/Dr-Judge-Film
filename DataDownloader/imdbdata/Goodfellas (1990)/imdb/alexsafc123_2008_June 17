This is as close a thing to film making perfection as you are going to
get in your lifetime. When I first saw this film several years ago I
thought it was the greatest film I have ever seen, and I still believe
that now.<br /><br />Goodfellas is the chronicling of the life and times of Henry Hill
(Liotta) and his seedy underworld dealings with his dubious associates
Jimmy Conway (De Niro) and Tommy De Vito (Pesci). It begins with with
his entanglement with the mob, follows his rise to power and riches,
then allows you to watch, as his whole carefully balanced life comes
crashing down around him in spectacular fashion.<br /><br />What stands out for me about this film is that it does not rely on
flashy special effects, extravagant pyrotechnics or a spot of the good
old ultra violence (that said this film is by no means without
violence), but it simply uses extraordinary story telling, a skill lost
all too easily on most of modern cinema. It will suck you in right from
the get go and grasp you to its greasy, mozzarella scented bosom right
until the closing minutes when you are allowed to un-immerse yourself
from the captivating portrayal of the life of a &quot;goodfella&quot;.<br /><br />Scorsese has without doubt been one of the best and most consistent
directors and film makers of all time, everything he touches seems to
turn to wonderfully gritty, seedy, gold, but I believe this to be his
Magnum Opus above all of his other films and accolades throughout his
career. He has a method of presenting the gangster genre I have yet to
see be surpassed in terms of sheer entertainment value and depth. He
also brings out truly top drawer performances from some undoubtedly
great actors across the whole spectrum of the cast. Only this truly
great combination of this directing, acting, and not to mention the
realistic and natural scripting, could culminate to make the viewer
feel some sympathy (mixed with a small degree of satisfaction at Hills
retribution) towards a murdering, coke snorting, cheating mobster and
all round scum bag.<br /><br />This film also boasts the infamous &quot;You think I&#39;m funny?&quot; scene with
Pesci providing a truly incredible performance here in particular. In a
matter of minutes Tommy&#39;s character is encapsulated in emphatic style
providing a brilliantly suspenseful and humorous peek into his psyche.<br /><br />I would recommend this film to anyone that has not seen it already, and
if you haven&#39;t, why the hell not?! It&#39;s been out for 18 bloody years go
and buy the DVD now!
