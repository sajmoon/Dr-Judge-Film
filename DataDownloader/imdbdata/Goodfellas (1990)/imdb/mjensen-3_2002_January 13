This is the best mob film ever.  Scorsese's directing is on top just as are
Deniro's and Liotta's performances.  Joe Pesci plays the perfect psycopath
and Deniro as usual gives a great performance as  he does in every other
Scorsese film. 
 New generation, old tradition, that's exactly what this movie is all about.
  In the old tradition a wise guy would never kill a made guy, in the new
tradition, a wise guy does kill a made guy but he can't get away with it.<br /><br />Does the Godfather deserve to be in the same category as Goodfellas?  &quot;I say
Yes.&quot;  There are three reason's why I think this is true.  1. The directing
in both movies captures the reality of mob life and how their lives end.  2.
The acting in both movies is superlative 3. The two movies depict the same
subject but with  different stories. <br /><br />I have to admit I think Goodfellas is much better than Godfather because the
murder scenes in  The Godfather are too stylish and too made up. Goodfellas
on the other hand is based on a true story and the violent scenes look real
and you get that feel of reality in those scenes because it really did
happen. 
 I'm not about to say Martin Scorsese is a better director than Coppola, but
I feel that Scorsese's film Goodfellas has more emotion than Coppola's film
Godfather.  
Remember that scene in Goodfellas when Deniro, Liotta, and Pesci are beating
the life out of that made guy in the bar and you hear the music getting
louder? That's what Scorsese does with his films. He uses music to enhance
emotion in his movie's.  
Coppola does not do that, no music, no feeling, just a scene and a person. <br /><br /> Some people may not like the ending of Goodfellas. 
To tell you the truth, I didn't like the ending at first, but I saw it five
more times and I like it now. I know the ending doesn't give us a reason not
to be a gangster, but Scorsese didn't want this film to have a sad ending
like Blow. He wanted to make this film funny and crazy because that's the
way Nicholas Pileggi's mob life was, funny and crazy. Scorsese did this film
his way, the Martin Scorsese way.  <br /><br />I recommend this movie to anyone who is a Scorsese fan.  I give it a 10 out
of 10.
