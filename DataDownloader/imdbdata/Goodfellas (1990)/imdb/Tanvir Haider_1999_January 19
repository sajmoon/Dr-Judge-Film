Martin and Francis are the only two directors who can actually make good
mafia movies. And This one is done by Martin. I really like his style. The
way he always starts from the present and goes back to the past and comes
back to the present again - it's just beautiful. And there is always a
narrator explaining things. That's another thing about Martin's movies, you
don't get confused. it's very simple and clear and you really get to
understand the characters. I can compare this with other Martin's movies,
the story is very nicely told. If you like &quot;Casino&quot; then you will like this
one.
