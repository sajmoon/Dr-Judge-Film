In what has become, deservedly so one of the best mob movies ever there
is a mistake that has always bugged me. During the scene near the
beginning of the movie where they take the mailman into the pizza
parlor and threaten him with putting his head in the oven if he
delivers any more mail to Henry&#39;s house, the mailman&#39;s hand is on the
inside of the door of the pizza oven. And I believe his other hand is
on the top of the oven. Since most pizza ovens are kept at a
temperature of 500 or more degrees Fahrenheit it would have been
impossible to keep his hand on the inside of the oven door since the
door would be just as hot as the oven. Even the outside top of the oven
would have been way too hot to leave one&#39;s hand on. Obviously they used
an oven that was not turned on to make the scene.
