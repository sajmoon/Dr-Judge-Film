1998_October 20 

What can't be said about this film?  It is the single best motion picture
made this decade.  It shows every aspect of why Martin Scorsese is the
greatest living American director.  It would have been simple enough to make
a small budget gangster film from Pillegi's book, but Scorsese wanted to
give us more than that.  Reading the book makes me want to see the film
again and vice versa.  If anyone ever wants to know what Judas felt like
just like at Ray Liotta's eyes at the conclusion of the film.  He's right,
he's just an average schnook who's sold his whole life out for nothing.
What more can be said?
