GoodFellas is the greatest gangster movie of all time because it does not
pander to the audience like the Godfather's which glamorize the gangsters
and the gangster lifestyle without showing a more realistic mob.
GoodFellas
is based on a true story which makes it more effective.  The acting by
Dinero, Pesci, and Liota are extremely realistic and are supported by
great
supporting actresses and actors like Paul Sorvino and Debbie Mazar.  The
soundtrack fits the movie perfectly and helps set the scenes of the
greatest
gangster movie of all time.
