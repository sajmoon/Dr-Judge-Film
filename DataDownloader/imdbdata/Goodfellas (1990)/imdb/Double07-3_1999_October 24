Forget everybody who say that GoodFellas is the greatest gangster film since
the Godfather, GoodFellas is the greatest!<br /><br />It is Martin Scorsese's finest film to date and how it did not sweep the
Oscars the way Godfather did, is beyond me! I guess the Academy was once
again intimidated by Scorsese's sheer brilliance and realism!<br /><br />Robert De Niro is as usual magnificent. Lorraine Bracco gives one of
thefinest performances I have seen from a woman for ages. Ray Liotta also
gives a super performance and in many respects is the driving force behind
the film. But it is Joe Pesci who steals the show! He won an Oscar for his
performance and that is the least he deserved..... the greatest performance
of his life!!!!!! Even the minor parts are played brilliantly!<br /><br />The film has it all... thrills, spills, humour, drama and even sadness! You
will remember it forever, the quotes will stay in your head for
years!<br /><br />If you see one last film in your lifetime, it HAS to be GoodFellas!!!!
