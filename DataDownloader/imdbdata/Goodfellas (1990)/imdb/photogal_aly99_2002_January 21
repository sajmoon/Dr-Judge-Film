Great use of voice-over narration from Ray Liotta's character. Fluid scene
transitions and fantastic placement of carefully picked songs accent the
&quot;mise en scene&quot; in each scene. This character driven film is delightful to
watch, especially the opening and closing montages. Martin Scorsese is a
master of film and everyone should get a glimpse of the amazing chemistry
between DiNero and Scorsese.
