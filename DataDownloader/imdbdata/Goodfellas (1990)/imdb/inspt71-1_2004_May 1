<br /><br />           What the heck was this? This was one horrible movie if I've ever
seen it. 
Martin Scorsese again bring a movie with a terrible plot, terrible
characters and 
a very slow moving film. What was with Joe Pesci's character? It seems to me<br /><br />that Pesci got an Oscar for saying the F-word over and over again. While
Pesci 
might have kept up the show for a while, his two supporting actors Robert Di<br /><br />Niro and Ray Liotta played weak characters. As I said before, the plot was<br /><br />horrible. Why this movie received as many Oscar nominations it did, I'll
never 
know.
