The first time I ever watched Goodfellas, I could actually relate to the
young Henry Hill when he quotes that unforgetable line &quot;As far back as I
can
remember, I always wanted to be a gangster&quot;, after watching this movie I
really did wanna be a gangster.<br /><br />Everything about this film is top drew stuff, The actors are all perfectly
cast, Robert De Niro is good as the calm but cunning hoodlum legend
Jimmy'the gent'Conway, Joe Pesci is funny and dangerous as<br /><br />hot-head Tommy DeVito and deserved the best supporting actor that year,
Ray
Liotta who has not produced a performance equal to this since is
impressive
as wiseguy turned rat Henry Hill. Paul Sorvino and Lorraine Bracco also
add
good support.<br /><br />The movie tells the story of three decades of todays modern gangstas and
what they get up to. My favorite seens are the &quot;what do u mean I'm funny&quot;
and the &quot;Go getcha f**kin shine box&quot; both of which have become
legendary.<br /><br />I would also like to praise the great dialogue, script and soundtrack.
This
movie is just so good I can't even think of anything else good enough to
say
about it that has not been said in other reviews, so if you have not seen
this classic get of your fat arsess and go out n buy it.
