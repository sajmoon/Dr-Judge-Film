Why should anyone care about any of the characters in this movie? Not one
seemed to have any redeeming virtues at all, beyond a certain amount of
initiative to make something of themselves, by any means fair or foul.
That
they all came to squalid ends was good, but watching it happen seemed like
pointless voyeurism.
