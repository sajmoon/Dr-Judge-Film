I was bored in study hall, it was a Friday before a long break, so I
decided to watch this movie. Have you ever listened to a song
compressed to an unreasonable size? This is what this film is. Crushed
to a time of around of 72 minutes, this story could really use two. The
truth is, this film doesn't convey anything. There's no central point
or conflict. &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, a much better film, pulled off the lack of
a main central conflict, but without any characterization, or a sense
of a real journey this film suffers the same fate as the boring
&quot;Aviator&quot;. The story of a real person with a lot of glitz and gloss
galore in every seen but a severe lack of content. Every seen moves
very fast and everything happens instaneously and they use a narrator
to fill in the blanks of information they use narrators.
Characterization dies and a quick and painless death in this pointless
script. I'm pretty sure the book writer and writer of the script had a
central conflict or point of the film in mind when they wrote it,
however, it never comes out in the film. This movie is just bad.
