The remarkable true story of Henry Hill and the crime family to which
he associates, paints a true picture of life in the mob. A fantastic
transformation of book to screen, directed in excellent fashion by
Scorcese; while sticking in great detail to the story of Henry Hill's
narratated book Wise Guy.<br /><br />The casting for this film was perfect. Joe Pesci as Tommy put in an
amazing performance and won the films only Oscar as Best supporting
actor. Robert De Niro put a top performance in as Irish borderline
psycho hustler Jimmy Conway and Ray Liotta put a career marking
performance as leading character Henry Hill. The supporting cast was
excellent also in a film with every day believable characters all the
while, despite the world they were in.<br /><br />The film starts off with Henry as a young kid, desperate to be a
gangster like the mob guys on his street, in a neighbourhood of
'schmucks' in Long Island. Henry hustles his way into the money, which
he passes up to his mob boss protector Paulie. The money he scams gives
him respect on the street but he can never be a made guy because of his
Irish father. The first hour of the film is a tale of the great life
they were living but as is the way in organised crime it can't last and
they ultimately lead to their own downfall through excess and greed;
something that emphasised the times, from the late 60s and 70s setting.<br /><br />It's a landmark in directing as freeze frames, pauses, a lack of
continuity at times, a forward premonition at the start and a great
scene where Henry and his then girlfriend Karen enter the Copa through
the back door. It's stylish but unlike say with Tarantino in Pulp
Fiction it's done in a gritty sense, rather than just for show. The
film leads you into thinking that although the gangster life is great
while it lasts, it's an empty world where you can be whacked at anytime
for anything by your supposed best friend.
