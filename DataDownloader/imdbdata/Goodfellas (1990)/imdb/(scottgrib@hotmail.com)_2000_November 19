This movie was great, as most people comment, but what lacked was the
ending.  It suddenly ended abruptly.  Kind of a let down, considering the
way the rest of the movie went.  Great movie, I loved it, but the end was a
little to sappy and feel good to be a true gangster classic.  By all means
watch this movie.  I give would have given it a 9... but alas some times
even the best things can let you down in the end -- 7
