Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci--their names say it all. De
Niro and Pesci were iconography for 1980s gangster genre.<br /><br />Liotta plays Henry Hill--the main protagonist--who is seduced by life
in the mafia; The film traces his humble beginnings as a runner-boy to
his eventual rise to power. Guts, glory and power summarize the first
half of the film.<br /><br />However, as it the film progress's, it gets bleaker and bleaker for
Henry Hill as the price to pay for being in the mafia takes a toll on
him.<br /><br />Clearly, Scorsese challenges the ideology that life in the mafia grants
one power and glory--it sets up a direct contrast between mafia-power
and the price to pay for that power. If the Godfather Trilogy
glamorized the mafia, Goodfellas certainly deconstructs that glamor as
the film progresses.<br /><br />The iconography is fantastic as it plays upon the usual mafia codes:
flashy suits, cigars, nice cars and the actors themselves all serve to
enhance the beautiful visual display of the gangster stereotypes used
in the film.<br /><br />Brilliant, insightful and factual Goodfellas is a must see for any
gangster-genre fan !
