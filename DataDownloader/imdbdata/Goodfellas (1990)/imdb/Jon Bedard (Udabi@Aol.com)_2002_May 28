Being Scorcese's greatest achievement in his ingenius moviemaking career
(with a few debatable exceptions i.e. Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Mean
Streets, Casino, etc.), this is perhaps the greatest filmmaking
accomplishment ever.  Being of the ever-popular and fiercely competitive
genre of gangster flicks, it holds its own against movie legends like
Godfather I and II.<br /><br />This movie is one of perfect structure, tracing three decades of mafia life
through the eyes and narration of Henry Hill, whose only ambition since
early childhood is induction into gangsterdom.  His character (Ray Liotta)
is well-rounded, and surprisingly well acted (attributable to Scorcese's
direction).  And the other characters' acting is superb, Pesci and his
spontaneous actions and uncaring attitude about human life, and De Niro and
his sublime portrayal of &quot;The Gangster&quot;(Only rivaled by Brando and Pacino's
performances in the Godfather trilogy).<br /><br />First-rate film, a great director's best, if you don't like Goodfellas,
your
opinion is void.
