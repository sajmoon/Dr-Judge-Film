This film is truly amazing.  This is what film is all about.  Spectacular
direction, excellent acting, and a wonderfully written script.  Every
character is engaging and keeps your eyes and ears interested the entire
time.  This is my favorite Martin Scorsese film.  He just keeps making
great
films.  If people say it's overrate it's simply because they don't want to
admit just how wonderful this film is.  I've seen it many times and I
never
lose my interest.  I only wish Ray Liotta had gained more praise for his
underrated performance.  He was truly terrific.  I completely believed
that
he WAS Henry Hill living a life in the mob.  A must to
buy!
