This is a really, really good Mafia movie. This movie ranks right up
there close with the Godfather movies. I think this movie actually
seemed a little more realistic than the Godfather. But don&#39;t get me
wrong, it&#39;s still no Godfather. De Niro, Pesci, and Liotta were all
great. Every time I see Pesci I think Mafia stooge; that&#39;s just the way
he comes off in all his movies. He plays his role to perfection. He
definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. De Niro was
fantastic too, although this wasn&#39;t the normal role he plays. He was
still a tough guy in this movie, but he was really paranoid throughout
the whole thing. Every time I saw him on screen I could tell how badly
he wanted in &quot;the family&quot;, so he played that part perfectly. If the
Godfather movies had never been made, then this would be the top Mafia
movie out there.
