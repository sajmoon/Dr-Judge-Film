Although many people will disagree and claim this status for &quot;The
Godfather&quot;, I believe that &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is the best gangster movie ever
made. Unflinchingly realistic, this film is not content to simply glamorize
the criminal lifestyle but also shows what violent sociopaths choose to live
it. More important, it shows the downfall and bad end that most such people
can expect to eventually come to. If nothing else the sheer number of
imitators this movie has spawned should be a testimony to it's brilliance. A
must see, no two ways about it.
