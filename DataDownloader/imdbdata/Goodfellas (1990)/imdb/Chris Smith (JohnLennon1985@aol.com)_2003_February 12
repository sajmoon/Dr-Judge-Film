Goodfellas is without a doubt one of the best movies of the 90s. In fact, I
rank it up with the Godfather. It is one of the best crime movies ever.
Martin Scorcese has shown some excellent direction in this
movie.<br /><br />Ray Liotta was excellent, Robert DeNiro was excellent, Joe Pesci was
excellent. This movie has some of the best casting I've ever
seen.<br /><br />The story was great, and the execution of the story added to it. Goodfellas
is a great movie. IMDb thinks so, AFI thinks so, I think so too.
10/10.
