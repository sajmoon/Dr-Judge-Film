Goodfellas is absolutely one of the best Gansgter movies ever! The
original bad boys De niro and Pecci are now joined by Ray Liotta who
transforms and already magnificent duo into a Tantalising Trio. The
only thing missing in this film??? The one and only Al Pacino! If Al
were to have starred in this movie it would still be the most popular
movie ever. I only recently have witnessed the greatness of Al Pacino
and Robert De Niro and wish that i had started witnessing (as it were)
their great work a long time ago. Goodfellas is a great trial and error
film, with plenty of risks and blood spillages (Joe Pecci getting shot
in the head) (Joe Pecci shooting and stabbing a &quot;Made&quot; man in the back
of his car) i would give this film ten out of ten, but.... i don't feel
it deserves this rating. 8 out of 10 will do. This is a must have for
any movie collection (even if you don't like it) Buy it now........<br /><br />A modern remake would also be great to see. As Joe and Robert are
getting older we need new &quot;Orginial&quot; second hand bad boys. lets
see...... Vanilla Ice??? No. I think not!
