This movie is great from beginning to end. I was expecting it to be
descent
but it was one of the best movies i have ever seen. I thought it might
start
out kind of slow and boring, but I was hooked right away. This is the
first
movie that I have watched that ray liotta is in and now I want to see more
of his movies I also liked robert deniro. Another thing i liked about this
movie is that it is not to long for a drama it is kind of a short movie.
if
you like blood and violence and robert deniro or ray liotta or gangster
movies you will love this movie.
