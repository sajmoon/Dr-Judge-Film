2000_January 27 

I was all set to write a nice review of this film, but nothing I could say
here would do it justice.  It's a great film with an Oscar performance from
Joe Pesci.  Ray Liotta is excellent.  Robert DeNiro is excellent.  Lorraine
Bracco is excellent.  Just see it and take my word for it.  This gangster
film at its best.
