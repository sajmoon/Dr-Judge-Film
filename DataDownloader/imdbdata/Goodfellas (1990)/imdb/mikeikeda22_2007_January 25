A modern classic by a great director! Ray Liotta&#39;s best film by far and
an academy award performance by Joe Pesce. DeNiro is awesome. Based on
a true story that shows the cut throat seamy side of the underworld. I
cannot believe how many young adults have not seen this film. A must
see for anyone who loves film. One of the top 10 on my list along with
The Seven Samurai, Rashomon, The Godfather 1&amp;2, Shawshank Redemption,
Pulp Fiction, The Matrix, Raging Bull, Heat and JFK. Goodfellas
portrays gangsters and their wives in a realistic, low life, street
level manner that is the opposite of The Godfather which romanticizes
the genre. Although Goodfellas is a drama of the highest order it has
many memorable comedic moments. The characters are richly detailed
through the narration of Ray Liotta as Henry Hill and we see the dog
eat dog survival lifestyle.
