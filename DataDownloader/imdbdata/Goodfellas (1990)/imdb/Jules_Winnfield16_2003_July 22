This movie is based on the book Wiseguy. The book was based on a true
story,
so ofcourse the movie is too. The film is about three friends who become
criminals. Robert DeNiro is one hell of an actor. He plays the friendly,
but
tough criminal: Jimmy &quot;The Gent&quot; Conway. This role was probably pretty
damn
tough. Then there's Ray Liotta who plays Henry Hill. Henry Hill is a
cocaine
sniffing young criminal. Joe Pesci is funny (as he showed in My Cousin
Vinny). He still has a little bit of comedy in this movie. He plays the
maniac, Tommy DeVito. That role earned him an Academy Award. Lorraine
Bracco
plays Karen Hill (Henry's wife). Bracco has a tough role playing Hill's
wife. Then last, but not least. There's Paul Sorvino. He plays the mob
boss:
Paul Cicero. Or in the movie: Paulie. All these great actors, but what
about
the director? Well the director is Martin Soresce. We know Soresce
directing
films like: Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Gangs of New York. Overall, this
movie
is absolutley brilliant! Watch it people! A 10 out of 10!
