I really hate that such a small-minded movie is always compared to the
grand The Godfather. Whats the point? Gangsta-Crap? Oh no, some-when
teenage was over for good.<br /><br />Maybe it&#39;s not worthy any word that could explain how this one misses
real class in so many aspects, but hat one should be said: it&#39;s no more
than a whining comedy diary of a boring careerist with weak civilian
motives whose coward character creeping out of coverage in the end.<br /><br />To let it have been kicking it would have needed more contrasts, more
shadowing and suspicion, more mystery and puzzle, more dramatics and
development instead of so much blah blah blah.<br /><br />Nice if you are a kid that can&#39;t walk by itself, but otherwise an
annoying waster.
