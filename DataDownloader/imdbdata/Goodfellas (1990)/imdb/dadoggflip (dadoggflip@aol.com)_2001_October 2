If you haven't seen this movies, get it now.  This movie is one of the
most
exciting violent movie i have seen.  As a very picky critic, I am very
impressed with Martin Scorcesse's directing of this movie.  Trust me, I
have
seen tons and tons of Mob movies in my lifetime and I never seen anything
as
compelling and fathom as this move....two thumbs up.
