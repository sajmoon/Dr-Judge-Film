I will keep my review on this masterpiece short.Unless your a recluse
who doesn't know about this film please go and buy a copy and watch it
or you'll kick yourself when some young punk upstart trys to remake it
starring Freddy prinze jr or josh hartnett(urrghh).Three decades of a
mob associates life are played out for our viewing pleasure,Ray liotta
has not had a decent role since apart from lending his voice to'Grand
theft auto,vice city'a video game.Joe pesci won a well deserved best
supporting actor Oscar for his portrayal of unstable nutbag 'tommy
devito'.The soprano's owes a lot to this film especially the way the
violence and dialogue are portrayed in a rather unflinching fashion,i
almost forgot Robert de niro's in this movie so that should make fans
of real actors rush out and grab a copy,i have seen this movie about 20
or 30 times and never get sick of it,Scorsese please make more classics
like this and save a dying artform.
