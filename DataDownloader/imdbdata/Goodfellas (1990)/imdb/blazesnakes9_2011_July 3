&#x22;As far back as I can remember, I&#x27;ve always wanted to be an gangster.&#x22;
-Henry Hill. 1955 New York. Martin Scorcese&#x27;s film of violence and
drama spills on the big screen in Goodfellas. The true story of the New
York gangster Henry Hill. Ray Loitta plays Henry Hill, who gets enticed
through the stages of an gangster when he pursues his dreams with his
partners, Jimmy Conway and Tommy DeVito,played by Robert De Niro and
Joe Pesci. Throughout the film, Henry goes through marrying his wife,
played by Lorraine Bracco and having an family. The person who got him
involved in the gangster business is Paul Cicero, played by Paul
Sorvino. After a while, henry goes to prison and gets out. Then, after
Pesci&#x27;s character is a made man, the good times of Henry being an
gangster begins with an killing of an man. Scorcese&#x27;s film making
shines in the movie. Pesci&#x27;s performance as well as Bracco, Loitta and
De Niro are terrific. Goodfellas is one of the best films of 1990 and
it&#x27;s on my Number 1 Best Film of 1990. Here, the movie never bothers to
fall behind or gets dull. It&#x27;s an absolute masterpiece of Scorcese&#x27;s
cinema.
