This is such a great film that you won&#39;t even believe it. It is more
great and with more frequency than 12 rubbish films (that have little
bits in them that are actually quite good) put together, and that is NO
FACT! It&#39;s all about a little boy who starts a new job as a taxi driver
in a parking area for cars. He buys new shoes, so his dad smacks him
with a whip and out of anger he blows up the cars he used to drive
around in his little parking area. Then before he knows it he is a
fully grown man with a little friend called Tommy! It is a film about
the mafia but it&#39;s not boring like the mafia films from 30 years ago.
People actually get killed in this film in really fun ways like
stabbings.<br /><br />I thought it was so good when I saw it that I said to myself I had to
tell the world how much it will like it, so here I am. Listen you, this
film will make you so happy you&#39;ll want to adopt some kind of pet.
