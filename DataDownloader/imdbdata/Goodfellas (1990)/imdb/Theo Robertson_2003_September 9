Ah yes gangsters  , a bunch of misunderstood criminals , or at least
popular
myth would have us believe . They`re nice to their moms , kind to animals
and children and if they have to kill someone ..... well it`s business ,
no
hard feelings . You know the cliches and Hollywood is more guilty than
anyone of propping up these myths and it`s great to see a Hollywood movie
deconstruct these fictions . GOODFELLAS shows gangsters as they are :
Violent thugs and contemptable cowards . Very few films have come up with
a
bloodchilling villain in the shape of Tommy and the most terrifying thing
is
this evil little b@stard existed in real life . Oh and despite all these
hard men strutting around letting everyone know how tough they are in
reality they`re sh*t scared of doing hard time , there`s no honour amongst
thieves and these tough guys would cut their mothers throat to stay out of
jail<br /><br />Scorsese directs in a MTV inspired way . With the exception of Spielberg
all
great American directors were doing this at the time . Oliver Stone did it
with BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY , HEAVEN AND EARTH and NATURAL BORN
KILLERS
, Francis Ford Coppola did it with his version of DRACULA and Scorsese
would
continue the style with CAPE FEAR and CASINO . Scorsese directs in this
style with just the right amount of excess so the movie doesn`t suffer
from
being overdirected in the way CASINO was ( CASINO is basically an overlong
,
inferior remake of this film ) while the script by Scorsese and Nicholas
Pileggi is just about the right length and - Unlike CASINO - is
beautifully
paced and allows the audience to make up their own mind on Henry Hill who
only seems to be an innocent bystander throughout events - Yeah right<br /><br />Warner Bros are rightly remembered for their classic gangster flicks of
the
30s and 40s . They made another gangster classic in 1990 , and this time
they made a truthfull one
