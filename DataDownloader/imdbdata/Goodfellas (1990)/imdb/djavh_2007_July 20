SEVERAL SPOILERS HERE...<br /><br />This movie is great. The acting is superb, history is awesome and
characters (especially Tommy) are unbelievable. I really don&#39;t know how
many times i saw this movie. Every time when i saw it i replayed
several moments in it.<br /><br />That was: legendary scene &quot;what the f**k is so funny about me?&quot; :) this
scene are one of the best scene ever made in film and Tommy DeVito also
is one of the best character ever created. Joe Pesci is unbelievable
here (i think that this time his acting beats Robert De Niro pretty
hard:)). This sequence is very funny and at the same time you can feel
the threat that is coming from all movements of Tommy. Also i was
stunned when i saw acting in sequence when Tommy talks with Spider. Of
course, Tommy does not only talk with him ;).(Michael Imperioli is
better when he acts like a waiter here than like a mafioso in
Sopranos:)). Also very well done is scene where Henry , Tommy and Jimmy
are eating at Tommy&#39;s moms house. It&#39;s very funny and very ironic.<br /><br />So i named some best moments in this film. Believe me, when these
moments are joined together, we get crushing combination of humor,
thriller and drama. It is full of gore mob life. It is &#39;Goodfellas&#39; <br /><br />And don&#39;t forget to &quot;go home and get your f**king shine box&quot; :DDD <br /><br />Sorry about my English :)
