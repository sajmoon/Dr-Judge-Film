Martin Scorsese pulls you into the world of Henry Hill so effortlessly, you
don't even realize 
that nearly two and a half hours have gone by.  Henry Hill gives us first
person narration in his 
rise through the ranks of the mob.  He goes from being a small time hood, to
a major player.  
Along the way, we meet his partners in crime: Jimmy Conway and Tommy
DeVitto.  These two 
are played with finesse and bombast by Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci.  We get
glimpses into the 
lives of wiseguys.  They have money, power and girls.  But underneath the
glossy surface, there's 
always the treat of violence that could erupt at any time.  An off the cuff
remark from Henry 
sends Tommy into a rant that borderlines a catastrophe.  Scorsese pulls no
punches in delivering 
the violence that fills the lives of these people.  Life in the mob is not a
glamorous life, it's 
filled with threats, violence, and paranoia.  One of the best sequences in
the film is toward the 
end where Henry starts out his day at 6:55 AM and it gets worse from there. 
Scorsese pulls 
you into Henry's frantic world by the voiceover, and pretty soon, you're
concerned about the 
dinner that Henry is planning.  Goodfellas is one of the best films ever
made about life in the 
mob.  It shows the highs and the lows, and the danger that lays in each.
