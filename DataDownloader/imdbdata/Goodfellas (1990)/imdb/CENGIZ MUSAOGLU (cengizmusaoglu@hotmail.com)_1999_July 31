1999_July 31 
<br /><br />I recommend everybody seeing this outstanding movie.You will find the
scope to grasp such  powerful actors Robert De Niro  and Joe Pesci
are.Especially Pesci's performance is worth seeing.I can say that
everything is perfect in the movie except Ray Liotta.He is virtually lost
besides other big players.
I couldn't find the opportunity to see &quot;Goodfellas&quot; in 1990 but I added
it
to my top ten last night.
