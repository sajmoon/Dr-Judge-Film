There is no doubt that Goodfellas is a true gangster classic which
represents high points in the careers of those involved in it. Scorsese
tells the true story of Henry Hill and his cohorts superbly, starting as
he
means to go on - with a violent, profanity ladened fast paced tale of
Hill's
rise to prominence in New York's organised crime underworld during the
sixties and seventies and his subsequent rapid demise as he goes from
airport heists to drug dealing and finally ends up in the witness
protection
scheme where he remains to this day.<br /><br />As Scorsese takes us on this twenty five year journey we are introduced to
and get to know the various wiseguys that Hill associates with, from those
at the very top like Paulie Cicero to people like Morrie (Chuck Low) and
brief introductions to Jimmy &quot;Two Times&quot; and Fat Andy etc. And then there
is
Tommy De Vito. Let's make no mistake about it, this is Pesci's finest
performance which rightly won him the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Unlike
Casino in which he basically plays the same character but with a different
name, in Goodfellas Pesci is far more believable as a guy who will kill
people without thinking twice but despite this, he doesn't make the
audience
dislike him, he is a far more rounded character and despite all his
violence, and after all the fast talking and wisecracks you can't help but
like him and find him amusing.<br /><br />Pesci is the one with most of the best lines in the film, the most famous
of
which is the Funny How? scene which legend has it was written and directed
by Pesci at the request of Scorsese. It is a scene that demonstrates both
sides of Tommy's character perfectly and which couldn't have been bettered
in any way. It's definitely one of my favourite movie moments.<br /><br />Pesci's undoubtably steals the show in Goodfellas but every single
character
in the film is played to perfection. Liotta, despite not going on to
bigger
and better things after Goodfellas, is convincing as Henry and De Niro
despite not having as much screen time as one might expect in such a film
plays the charismatic but also &quot;violent when necessary&quot; Jimmy Conway, who
holds a lot of sway within the organisation and is the orchestrator of
most
of the heists. Others of note include : Lorraine Bracco, Frank Vincent,
Paul
Sorvino and Catherine Scorsese who plays Tommy's mother, all of whom fit
their respective roles in the film perfectly.<br /><br />**** out of 4
