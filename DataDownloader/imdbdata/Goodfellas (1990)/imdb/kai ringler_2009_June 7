Definitely one of the better Mob movies of the past 30 years. Ray
Liotta gives a great performance as Henry Hill,, from a youngster all
the way up to the very end when he is older. also starring is Robert
deniro,, Joe Pesci,, and Paul Sorvino,, as Paulie, the boss,, there are
other characters in here that just make the picture also,, the movie
deals with the rise and fall of the gangsters,, especially trailing the
career of one Henry Hill,, some of the characters do end up in jail,,
some do get out,, and others not so lucky,, there is rampant cocaine
use in here, you get the effects of watching henry as he gets paranoid
after snorting a bunch of it. all in all i think that this is probably
even better than the godfather i thought,, but it&#x27;s a close call.
