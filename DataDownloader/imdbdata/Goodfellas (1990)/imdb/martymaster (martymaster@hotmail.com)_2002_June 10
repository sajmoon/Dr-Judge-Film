This movie is just perfect.It has a great cast,a great director and a great
story.I am especially surprised by Joe Pescis acting,he is just amazing in
this movie,definitely his best movie yet.Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta is
also great.The story is very weel told and you get to see the life of a kid
while growing up and becoming a powerful man in the mafia.The mafia is
really good material for a movie,because it is really cool to see how
powerful they are and that they are usually above the law.
This is really a masterpiece.
