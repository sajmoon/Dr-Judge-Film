One of the best and funniest lines in an excellent movie.<br /><br />Goodfellas is, in my opinion, one of the best movies Scorsese&#x27;s ever
made. It has such great momentum, both dramatically and visually.
Ballhaus and Schoonmaker are really at the top of their game in this
movie. Fantastic.<br /><br />But it&#x27;s all in the story. If you don&#x27;t have it on paper, it doesn&#x27;t
matter how many cool camera angles or transitions you can come up with.
The movie runs for almost two and a half hours, yet it never gets
boring. It always manages to get, and keep, you interested. The script
is perfect. I normally have sort of a problem with voice overs. As
Brian Cox says in Adaptation: &#x22;God help you if you use voice-over in
your work, my friends. God help you. That&#x27;s flaccid, sloppy writing.
Any idiot can write a voice-over narration to explain the thoughts of a
character.&#x22;<br /><br />But here it works wonders, it helps to propel the story along with the
excellent soundtrack.<br /><br />And the characters... The names alone... Jimmy Two Times, Johnny
Roastbeef, Joe Buddha... Why don&#x27;t we see people like Frank Cicero and
Frank Vincent in more movies?<br /><br />Not to mention Ray Liotta. I don&#x27;t get why he isn&#x27;t hired more often.
Regardless how bad the movie is, he usually is able to make something
interesting and/or funny out of his character. Take &#x22;Copland&#x22; or
&#x22;Hannibal&#x22; or &#x22;Heartbreakers&#x22; or &#x22;Blow&#x22; or why not &#x22;Narc&#x22;? Well, as
always, there are exceptions. I wouldn&#x27;t see &#x22;Operation Dumbo Drop&#x22; or
&#x22;Escape from Absolom&#x22; again, even if my life depended on it...<br /><br />Joe Pesci is... ...well, he&#x27;s Joe Pesci in this movie. But I gotta hand
it to him, no one can pull off a Joe Pesci like he can! He IS funny
like a clown, and he DOES amuse me!<br /><br />Robert De Niro&#x27;s perfect as the laid back gangster Jimmy Conway who
just explodes with fits of rage.<br /><br />As I said, one of Scorsese&#x27;s best. He&#x27;s one of my all-time favourite
directors, but I just wish he&#x27;d stop making cr*p like Gangs of New
York. The Special Edition of Goodfellas is coming out on DVD in Europe
this fall, and I&#x27;ll be waiting first in line to replace my old version.<br /><br />I&#x27;d recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a movie with both a
compelling story as well as great characters. Although I have to leave
a little caveat, It IS violent.
