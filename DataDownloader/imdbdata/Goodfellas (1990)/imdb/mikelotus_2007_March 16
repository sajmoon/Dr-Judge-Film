This movie should have been Martin Scorsese&#39;s best director Oscar. His
directorial skills would never be better. During the scene in the
restaurant around the table, Scorsese puts you at that table with all
the wise guys. You feel like you are there. An fine example of some of
the best directing in film history. Instead they gave the Oscar to
first time director Kevin Costner for Dances with Wolves. You tell me
which movie will be remembered in another 10 years. Anyway this true
story of Henry Hill runs like the cocaine fueled Henry Hill. It
accelerates you to the end and then suddenly you are cut off. Amazing.
De Niro, Liotta, Pesci, Bracco and Sorvino all give top notch
performances. Pesci was never better than this movie. This is a true
work of art that will always be considered to be a great movie.
