Scorsese is a great director. Yet, I felt he couldn't mesh these three
strands together into a coherent whole. The Gangster part is great. The
Jail part is great. The Witness protection part is great. Yet, somehow,
the sum is less than the parts. Still worth a watch, though. Liotta is
great. De Niro is De Niro. Joe Pesci is terrific. Beautifully shot,
well edited, in its component parts, all the things you expect from a
Scorsese film are there. Except coherence. If you compare it to, say
'Last Temptation of Christ', which in many ways was a harder film to
direct, Goodfellas comes up wanting. Watch it. But appreciate its three
discrete parts, rather than the whole.
