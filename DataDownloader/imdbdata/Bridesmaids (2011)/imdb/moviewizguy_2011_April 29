Annie&#x27;s life is a mess. But when she finds out her lifetime best friend
is engaged, she simply must serve as Lillian&#x27;s maid of honor. Though
lovelorn and broke, Annie bluffs her way through the expensive and
bizarre rituals. With one chance to get it perfect, she&#x27;ll show Lillian
and her bridesmaids just how far you&#x27;ll go for someone you love. (C)
Universal<br /><br />When I saw the trailer for BRIDESMAIDS, I didn&#x27;t see anything special
with it. There were maybe a couple of good jokes in there but nothing
really hilarious to make me wanna see it right away. However, after the
end credits rolled from a prescreening I went to, I have to admit it:
It&#x27;s freaking hilarious! To put this into perspective, I don&#x27;t like
many modern comedies, so this is saying a lot. There was one sequence
in the film that was so funny and so shocking that I don&#x27;t think I have
ever laughed so hard in a film EVER! To say that the trailer doesn&#x27;t do
the film justice is an understatement. However, on the up side, the
trailer doesn&#x27;t show the funniest jokes in the film like most trailers
for comedies do these days (don&#x27;t you hate it when that happens?).<br /><br />And no. BRIDESMAIDS is not a chick flick. There are some raunchy scenes
in here that you have NEVER seen in any other film before. Let&#x27;s
remember, this is a hard R-rated Judd Apatow production, so this film
shouldn&#x27;t be taken very lightly. It&#x27;s not to say that BRIDESMAIDS is
one of the best comedies of the decade. In fact, as much as I laughed
throughout the film, it does slow down after the first hour with the
second hour not being nearly as funny as the first. Still, I laughed
out loud pretty frequently, which is a feat hard to pull off on someone
like me.<br /><br />BRIDESMAIDS is also pretty heartfelt. This is mostly due to the
wonderful ensemble cast, who are all fantastic in their own way.
Kristen Wiig FINALLY gets the chance to shine in a starring role!
Honestly, this girl can carry a film on her own. Maya Rudolph was also
great. Seeing the dialogue exchange between her and Wiig made their
chemistry feel very authentic which is no surprise since they were in
SNL together. It&#x27;s also fun to see Rose Byrne in more comedic roles,
who was also in GET HIM TO THE Greek and this year&#x27;s sleeper hit,
INSIDIOUS(!!).<br /><br />I think an obvious audience favorite from the group of girls would be
Melissa McCarthy. She provides some of the films biggest laughs and for
a good reason. Ellie Kemper and Wendi McLendon-Covey are the remainders
from the group and they were pretty good, but they aren&#x27;t as prominent
as the other girls. There are also some guys in the cast, most notably
Chris O&#x27;Dowd and Jon Hamm. O&#x27;Dowd did a good job playing Wiig&#x27;s love
interest (and you can pretty much see where this is going...), and Hamm
did well for the limited amount of screen time he had.<br /><br />Sure, BRIDESMAIDS is predictable as hell but so are 99.9% of other
modern comedies. However, it&#x27;s strong proof that one can make a comedy
about women without it ever being stupid, sexist, or mean-spirited.
Overall, it&#x27;s just plain old entertaining, hilarious, and heartwarming.
Who knew? Also, with the &#x22;HANGOVER with girls&#x22; comparison, BRIDESMAIDS
is a much funnier, insightful, and honest film than THE HANGOVER ever
was.
