I thought this movie is very funny and well written.I like Kristen Wiig
but sometimes on SNL I think she misses the mark but this movie she
co-wrote and stared in is a home run.We laughed through out the whole
movie and the crowd in the theater reacted the same way. The rest of
the cast was also very good.<br /><br />For a comedy this also had a good storyline and plot with some
substance other than slapstick.I would recommend this movie it is what
we need in this day and age we are living in.Bravo I hope we see more
of this from these women in the near future.I hope it does well at the
box office!
