totally off base... the recent NPR review made such a statement and
this was the ONLY way I&#x27;d see such a movie with my girlfriend. This
movie is a chick flick plain and simple with average acting,
predictable and boring story line, and MANY missed opportunities for
interesting plot twists... all I can say is this is a RENTAL at best...
and only for my girlfriend.<br /><br />So, NPR and other reviewers, stop the subterfuge by comparing a REAL
comedy like Hangover with a total chick flick that makes poor attempts
at humor... the farting and puke scenes were totally stupid... my
girlfriend thinks I&#x27;m stupid because I only laugh if a guy pukes or
farts... well... maybe guys are better actors (I just dodged a flying
object... LOL)...<br /><br />Bottom line.... this is a very average movie that is simply too cute to
be good...
