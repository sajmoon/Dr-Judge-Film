What just happened here? I just finished watching this movie, and what
I feel is beyond disappointment. I am huge comedy fan, I absolutely
love SNL cast, so my expectation bar was set pretty high. However, what
I got is extremely lame, boring copy of Hangover. Yes, there were
couple of moments in the movie when I kind of chuckled (doing #2 on the
street, in a wedding dress - if you are guy, you have to), but all of
them can fit into one SNL 2 minutes sketch. What I also don&#x27;t get here
is such a high rating this movie has!?! It is misguiding and I
seriously doubt that it might be orchestrated to keep the heat up...
Unless you have picture of Kristen Wiig in you wallet, you will fall a
sleep watching this movie.
