The most laugh-out-loud moments I&#x27;ve witnessed in a movie theater since
There&#x27;s Something About Mary. This should make Wiig a star -- and she
deserves it (she has a Meg Ryan quality). The rest of the cast is
hilarious also. <br /><br />This isn&#x27;t a formula film. The scenes are way longer but you won&#x27;t
notice (because you&#x27;ll be laughing so hard). They&#x27;re much richer and
funnier because they&#x27;re given time to unfold. <br /><br />I&#x27;m a guy. I went in with no expectations and came out with a big
smile. This is a female driven film (and women will love it) but guys,
don&#x27;t be afraid -- you&#x27;ll love it too. You won&#x27;t &#x22;look away!&#x22; (a joke
you&#x27;ll get after you see the film).
