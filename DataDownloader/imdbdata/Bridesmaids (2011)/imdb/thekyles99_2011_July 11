I&#x27;m going to start this review by saying that this film has to be one
of the highest over rated films i have seen. And please do not compare
it too Judd Apatow&#x27;s earlier works; Knocked Up, 40 year old virgin etc.
the difference being that those films were actually funny. Now i do not
know if this was due to the cast being basically newbies or what the
problem was here all i know is that i was sadly misled on the laughter
part. The storyline is where i actually decided to be nice and give
some points for. It&#x27;s original, thank god they didn&#x27;t have the maids so
to speak heading for Vegas or i would&#x27;ve walked out after the credits
rolled. Apatow also didn&#x27;t direct this, which is the next big mistake,
don&#x27;t get me wrong i like him in the producing role as well but this
would&#x27;ve completely rocked if it were in his vision. So in short this
film was OK i cant do much better then that i guess i don&#x27;t take
disappointment well!
