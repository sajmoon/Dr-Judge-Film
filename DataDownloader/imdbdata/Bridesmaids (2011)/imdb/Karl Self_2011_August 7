My problem with this movie is that in my parts it was touted as a
breakthrough female comedy, where women lead a raucous comedic
existence of their own. Which is pretty far off the mark for a good but
conventional rom-com (half romance, half comedy) that was designed to
evoke chuckles, and the occasional tender sob, without offending
anyone. Probably one positive aspect of the movie&#x27;s hybrid nature is
that it&#x27;s never at risk of becoming the female version of &#x22;The
Hangover&#x22;, on the other hand the romance between wayward Anne and that
Irish State Trooper is very bland and sickly. There is lots of comedic
talent on board, but it&#x27;s used very ineffectively. Indeed, the
hilarious movie trailer consists mostly of scenes that never made it
into the final cut -- why they wasted great scenes must remain the
producers&#x27; filthy little secret.
