Cast with possibly the two funniest actresses in the business today
(Kristen Wiig and Rose Byrne)I expected nothing less than &#x27;The
Hangover&#x27; if not better with this all female cast. What I received was
a flurry of burp, fart, vomit, diarrhea and semen jokes with no
originality involved whatsoever which, most importantly, produced no
laughs.<br /><br />Instead of laughing along with Wiig&#x27;s character as the movie
progresses, you undeniably can&#x27;t. Almost everything she says just makes
you cringe with awkwardness and sometimes even disgust as you
eventually wonder if you&#x27;re missing something funny that was just said
or done. You didn&#x27;t.<br /><br />If you&#x27;re expecting to laugh as much as &#x27;The Hangover&#x27; get ready to be
sorely disappointed.
