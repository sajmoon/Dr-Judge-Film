Another bride movie. Some laughs, but generally hard to watch. The way
the heavy girls were portrayed was ridiculous. Both heavy women were
played as bizarre with very few social norms. Why did they feel the
need to have the heavy women be the weirdest characters? What does this
say about the writers/producer/director? A little weight-phobic? I say
don&#x27;t waste your time with this movie. Potty humor? Really???? That&#x27;s
the best they could do? The main actresses gave good performances with
a few laughs. The best scene in the whole movie was the scene of one
woman trying to get arrested. The other scenes of disruption seemed
contrived and not very real. I watched it to the end just so I could
have some closure, not because I cared about the characters that much.
