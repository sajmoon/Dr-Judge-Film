Could have been a cute movie, but went over the top with foul, crude
and offensive language. The humor is sophomoric and seems like a movie
that was written by Beavis and Butthead. The language is over the top
foul. The behavior and reactions of characters is not believable, they
get stuck in a scene and didn&#x27;t know when enough is enough. This is not
a movie that would appeal to most adults unless they have a very low IQ
or the maturity of a 14 year old boy. It had a good premise with
possibilities, but they decided to go to the gutter with it. I would
not recommend letting children watch this movie and wouldn&#x27;t really
even want my teen to watch it.
