I had high hopes for this movie, it being touted as a female friendly
Hangover movie. I was disappointed with Hangover II, and thought this
would be more fresh. How wrong i was.... What really really annoyed me
in the movie was the part in the engagement party where the two women
were gushing over each other to speak, they changed places like a
gazillion times, and kept talking, and talking, until the slightest
humor of the occasion was completely gone. As far as I was concerned a
lot of the other jokes just fell flat. I couldn&#x27;t even tell if it was
women writing these awful lines or men, giggling insanely as they
attempted to make women just seem dumb, stupid, manipulative, bitchy,
and so so. I haven&#x27;t finished the movie yet, I got to half way. That is
how bad and poor it was, perhaps the second half is better hence all
these good reviews out there. Comedy really needs a shot in the arm.
