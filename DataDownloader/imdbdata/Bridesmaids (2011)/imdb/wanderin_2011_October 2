Like the Energizer Bunny &#x22;Bridesmaids (2011)&#x22; keeps going, going and
going&#x22; and the viewer keeps waiting and holding on to the precious few
laughs it produces in the first hour and hoping for more. Here lies the
real problem...what could have been? BM&#x27;s had the possibility to have
been a very funny entertaining movie if only the producers had chosen
better writers with original thoughts and jokes to make this movie what
it could have been...funny and entertaining. Instead a painful 2 hours
that only elicits minor chuckles at the expense of this viewers time
which would have been better spent watching grass grow. Seriously, I
really wanted this movie to make me laugh and I tried to participate,
until the very last minute of what I kept hoping for that never
materialized...funny entertainment.
