I thought this movie had it all! I went to this movie with my boyfriend
and another couple (we are all 25ish) and all 4 of us could not stop
talking about the movie when it was over. It was the perfect mix of
everything a good comedy should have and not to mention the whole
theater was laughing out loud over and over again. I was crying
laughing at some points! You could really relate to the characters,
especially Kristen Wiig&#x27;s character. She was flawless! I recommend
everyone sees this movie, and ladies don&#x27;t be afraid to &#x22;drag&#x22; your man
to this one! For sure one of the best comedies I have seen in a very
long time - tops my list for sure.
