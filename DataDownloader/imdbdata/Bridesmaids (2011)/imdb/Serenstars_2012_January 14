2012_January 14 
My 16 year old daughter and I were having a girl&#x27;s night in and decided
to rent a film. We watched the trailer for Bridesmaids and it seemed
the perfect choice. We settled down to watch and it started off bad and
went downhill from there, to the point where I couldn&#x27;t even make it to
the end. I thought it was absolutely dire! The main character is one of
the most annoying, unsympathetic characters I have ever seen in a film.
No redeeming features whatsoever. I could find nothing likable about
her - she was stupid, selfish, thoughtless and irritating in equal
measure - completely unlikeable. The other characters provided a couple
of isolated funny moments but that was it. I barely raised a smile
throughout, and when the main character was on screen I could hardly
watch. I am really surprised that there are so many positive reviews
for this movie. I honestly can&#x27;t think of one good thing to say about
it. Dreadful.
