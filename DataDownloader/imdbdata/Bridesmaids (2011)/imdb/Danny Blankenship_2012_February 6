If your looking for a good laugh and want a feel good viewing time then
please watch &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; it&#x27;s one comedy film that most any would
enjoy it&#x27;s got a blend of emotion and drama to fill any viewer&#x27;s taste.
The film is a please to view for it&#x27;s funny lines and crazy struggles
and mishaps and it&#x27;s spiced up just right with some sex appeal
especially from Kristen Wiig.<br /><br />Set in Wisconsin it involves a in her thirties young lady Annie(good
sexy performance from Kristen Wiig)who has hit a tough spot in her
life, it all began when her cupcake bakery closed down and she had to
then take a job as a ring shop clerk. Only matters get worse as due to
Annie&#x27;s outspoken sarcasm she&#x27;s fired only making matters even more
dark as Annie is cash strapped driving a high mileage rattle trap car,
then she&#x27;s put out of her apartment because she can&#x27;t pay the bills.
The only bright spots that Annie had going for her was looking good in
her sexy colored bras(I love the scenes of Kristen in the light blue
bra and the pink bra scene rocks!)and having no stings attached sex
with any guy! Still all may not be lost she has the chance to be maid
of honor at her best friend Lillian&#x27;s(Maya Rudolph) wedding. Along the
way getting to the big day is an emotional and funny ride for Annie and
the ladies. A different and unique performance that is eye catching is
Melissa McCarthy&#x27;s turn as a tough and gritty outspoken gal who&#x27;s just
a big lovable squeeze of a bridesmaid.<br /><br />Overall pretty good film to watch plenty of laughs and sex appeal the
film is outspoken and emotional with real life drama type of situations
and it proves be happy with who you are as in the end you will reach
your journey even if it is somewhat of a struggle.
