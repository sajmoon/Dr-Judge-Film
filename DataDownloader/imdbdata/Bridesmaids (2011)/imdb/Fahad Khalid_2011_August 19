If i would like to describe the movie in 3 words then it would be
&#x22;Irritating and awful&#x22; I&#x27;m actually surprised to see the rating. I
actually forced myself to complete the movie hoping that it might be
worth it, but i wasn&#x27;t. Kristen Wiig was simply irritating. She acted
superbly but Her character was stupid and lost through out the movie or
i should say that about the whole script. And just to have a happy
ending things were sorted out without much effort from her. This is one
of those movies that would give the worst meaning about Life and
especially Women. Best moments are the one which had Melissa McCarthy
in them, she was hilarious. Maya Rudolph actually looked ugly though
she acted well i guess. She was not at all the right person for the
bride.
