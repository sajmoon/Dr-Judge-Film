I heard of positive things about this movie and the reviews seemed to
be pretty good. So I had slightly high expectations for this movie, but
it just didn&#x27;t meet it. This is basically a overrated comedy that
annoyed me than it actually being fun and entertaining. It just seemed
all the characters were being obnoxious without even being funny, they
are constantly wacky and not believable at all and it just doesn&#x27;t work
very well. It just didn&#x27;t seem to know what direction this movie wanted
to go so it was like all over the place at times. After a few minutes
in I thought this was gonna be something similar to &#x22;Bride Wars&#x22; which
is another crappy movie but it goes in a different direction later on.
Most of the characters are abnormal in this, maybe to make it comical
but they really aren&#x27;t all that likable. So they are not believable and
yet it reminded me of one of those comedy TV shows like &#x22;The Office&#x22;
for example, except your not attached to the characters. Also sort of
reminded me of those comedic movies that is cheap and not believable
what so ever and tries way too hard to be funny at first. This isn&#x27;t a
charming comedy either and everything was just over the top without
being effective. The constant bickering and arguing between one another
gets annoying than actually funny, it&#x27;s goofy but not funny. The movie
is mostly about one of the bridesmaid falling down and feeling sorry
for herself and even that wasn&#x27;t done well. This isn&#x27;t a terrible
comedy but it&#x27;s overrated for sure. Also felt the movie was way longer
than it had to be.<br /><br />5.6/10
