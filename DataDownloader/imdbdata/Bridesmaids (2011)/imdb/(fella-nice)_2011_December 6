2011_December 6 
It&#x27;s exceedingly rare for me to see a movie and not be able to recall a
single detail afterward. What do I recall about Bridesmaids (2011)?
Just the feeling that it was a steaming pile,a waste of time, an
affront to script writers and movie-goers. That&#x27;s it. No scene or
chuckle or line comes to mind. This movie was so bad, I doubt it can
make it into a cult classic selection for horrible films.<br /><br />I&#x27;ve seen comparisons to other films, like Wedding Crashers, Dumb and
Dumber, and the Hangover. Each of those films had some redeeming
qualities. Two of them are in my collection. This film may have been
trying to be like those films, but it failed miserably, regardless of
the impression I have that the actors did their best. Don&#x27;t blame them
- one may polish a turd forever and just have a shiny turd.<br /><br />I wouldn&#x27;t use this film&#x27;s DVD as a coaster. Seriously. Avoid it. I
don&#x27;t know if some people sincerely like this, or if there is a
concerted campaign to keep the ratings up. The metacritic score of 39
is much more accurate, but still generous. The young lady who viewed
the film with me agreed.
