I&#x27;m not exactly sure who the people are who are giving this movie a
poor rating, but I can only assume they either have some malicious
intent or went into the movie with presumptions based solely off the
name. That or they just don&#x27;t have a sense of humor and should probably
be experimented on by the German&#x27;s (South Park reference... you&#x27;d have
to have seen it ) This movie is FUN. From start to finish, fun. It&#x27;s a
laugh a minute comedy usually reserved for an all-male cast but
delivered masterfully by an all-female cast. It&#x27;s defiantly not just
for the ladies, men will love this movie as well. In a world full of
comedy releases like &#x22;The Dilemma&#x22; and &#x22;Gullivers Travels&#x22;, Bridesmaids
is a breath of fresh air and reminds us that some producers (and
directors.. and writers) still care about the craft of comedy writing
and take the time to make their scrip &#x22;work&#x22;. They even had the time to
add some heart... for the ladies, I presume.<br /><br />Go see Bridesmaids.
