This movie is long, far far too long. Every 20mins or so there is some
problem that the main character faces which you know will take at least
another 20mins for her to overcome. This happens roughly 6 times, which
makes the film the wrong side of two hours long.<br /><br />I found myself truly engrossed in the main characters happiness, hoping
beyond hope that she makes something of her life and finds the guy of
her dreams. This was mainly because it would mean the film could be
over.<br /><br />If you&#x27;re looking to go somewhere dark for a couple of hours to get
some sleep I suggest going to see this film as nobody is likely to be
laughing so it will be very quiet, and there will be plenty of room to
stretch out too as many people will have left in the first 10-15mins.
