It is by far the worst movie I have seen this year. And I seriously do
not understand why is it labeled as a comedy? 80% of the movie it is
plain sad. A sad sad movie, about a girl who is miserable. She is
lonely, broke, and is loosing her childhood best friend. Between a
series of humiliating situations the director decided to add some
jokes, or situational gags. I have to admit, a couple of them were
funny. But apart from those, we get 2 hours and 10 minutes of a woman
being miserable. She is more miserable than Dr. House during hist stay
in the mental hospital and after Cuddy dumped him put together.<br /><br />The only good thing about this the role played by Chris O&#x27;Dowd, who is
funny and convincing. Too bad, there is only about 25 minutes of him in
that 2 hour 10 minutes worth of continuing sadness and misery.
