Every time I think Hollywood can sink no lower, they do. I guess this
film is considered a great &#x22;advance&#x22; in the field, because now these
horrendous script writers and directors have shown that the girls can
fart, defecate, curse and inflict &#x22;funny&#x22; pain just as well as the
boys.<br /><br />When will this idiocracy we live in finally get sick of &#x22;humor&#x22; that
would have been considered immature for 12 year old boys as recently as
twenty years ago? When was the last time a &#x22;comedy&#x22; was produced in
Hollywood that wasn&#x27;t based exclusively on potty humor and hapless
males getting hit in the crotch? <br /><br />Lorne Michaels should be ashamed of himself, for forcing all these
monumental no-talents on America. Kristen Wiig is merely the latest in
a long series of thoroughly unfunny, untalented, obnoxious &#x22;actors&#x22;
like Adam Sandler, Will Ferrell, David Spade, Rob Schneider, etc. Big
screen comedies basically have been taken over by the pathetic alumni
from SNL and the just as sordidly horrific &#x22;talent&#x22; emanating from the
stable of Judd Apatow.<br /><br />I wonder if Maya Rudolph-yet another ex-SNL cast member-can appreciate
the irony of her appearing in a work of &#x22;art&#x22; like this, considering
that she was one of the stars of Idiocracy. Probably not, considering
that none of the SNL people seem to have the slightest appreciation of
the brilliant satire Mike Judge employed in that film. Instead, they
continue to collect hefty paychecks for contributing ever more filth to
our decaying cultural landscape.
