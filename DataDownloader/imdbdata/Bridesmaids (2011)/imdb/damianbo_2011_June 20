2011_June 20 
I was very disappointed; I bought into the hype surrounding this movie
and found it to be one of the stupidest movies I&#x27;ve seen in quite some
time, and the local paper rated it five stars. We were ready to leave
after the first twenty minutes but having already spent our money
decided to stay and watch on the chance it would get better.....no
chance. I absolutely loved &#x22;The Green Lantern,&#x22; and the local paper
rated that only one star. I think perhaps someone may have mixed up the
ratings. Or it could be that my generation (mid-fifties) expects some
value for their money,and doesn&#x27;t need to be told what to like or
dislike. We&#x27;re not lemmings....But that&#x27;s what passes for entertainment
today, I guess....
