This was just about the worst movie I ever had to watch, will induce
mental illness and suicidal thoughts. Your eyes may become permanently
rolled back. &#x22;A chick flick for dudes&#x22; no... its a long horrible waste
of time. The story line and acting is an abomination. Kristen Wig not
funny, Maya Rudolph dumb, Jessica St. Clair dumb, Melissa McCarthy
obnoxious at best along with every other actor in this movie. clich&#xE9;s,
douchebag clich&#xE9;s, lousiness, phoniness, crap acting, waste of money,
crap script, crap directing. Can&#x27;t imagine why iwright84 seems to enjoy
this demoralizing horse turd so much? I personally wanted to commit
self immolation during this movie. Ashamed I ever watched it.
