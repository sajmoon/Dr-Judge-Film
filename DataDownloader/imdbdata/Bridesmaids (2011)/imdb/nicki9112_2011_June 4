OK, I gotta admit that when I saw a preview for this movie I thought it
looked lame. However after hearing many good reviews about it, I
decided to give it a go. Hooray - this movie is actually funny! Matter
of fact, I look forward to seeing it again and might even buy it when
it comes out on DVD. Kristen Wiig is hilarious. This was the first time
that I&#x27;ve actually watched her act, never really saw any of her stuff
before this movie. <br /><br />Also, I consider myself pretty picky when it comes to movies. It takes
a lot to make me actually laugh out loud and I was doing a lot of that
in this movie. I think that any female could relate to Kristen&#x27;s
character and some of her experiences. She doesn&#x27;t quite feel up to par
with where she&#x27;s at in her life but fortunately there is a lot of humor
that comes from this. I&#x27;m sure even some guys would enjoy this movie. <br /><br />Overall - Enjoyable, cute and hilarious!
