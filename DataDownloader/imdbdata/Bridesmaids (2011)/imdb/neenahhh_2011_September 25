Annie&#x27;s best friend, Lilian, has just gotten engaged, and Annie has
been picked to be Lilian&#x27;s maid of honor. Annie finds that the other
bridesmaids are very different from her personality. Aside from that,
there are a lot of other things going on in her life. Annie must learn
how to adjust accordingly, to make her best friend&#x27;s wedding perfect.<br /><br />I&#x27;ve read one good review about &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; before, saying how it was
inspiring and nice. That review made me want to see this movie. But now
that I&#x27;ve watched it? Yeech. Really, guys? A 7.2/10 for this movie?
This was not an entertaining movie.<br /><br />I didn&#x27;t find this movie that funny. The movie could have been funnier
if the jokes were toned down a bit. But they weren&#x27;t. I found some of
the jokes to be tasteless. I also found that I didn&#x27;t feel anything for
the characters. I didn&#x27;t care for the romance plot or Annie&#x27;s business
or etc. This movie was boring. And for people who said this was
inspiring? Really? Really? I&#x27;ll give credit to the little &#x22;best friend
triangle&#x22; plot, though.<br /><br />&#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; is no &#x22;Bride Wars&#x22;. You&#x27;re better off just watching the
latter one.<br /><br />Viewed on: September 25, 2011
