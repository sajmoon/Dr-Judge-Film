I&#x27;m not the biggest Judd Apatow fan, but I do consider his films
entertaining. A good majority of the films produced under the Apatow
Productions moniker are more than a little amusing, as well. In fact,
I&#x27;m partial to both Anchorman and Pineapple Express. Despite Apatow&#x27;s
involvement with the film, Bridesmaids didn&#x27;t really interest me all
that much in concept. Another R-rated comedy revolving around a wedding
with a mostly female cast? Who cares? The underestimation on my part
probably helped the film more than anything as Bridesmaids turned out
to be an adult comedy with a little more meat on its bones than the
trailers perhaps lead you to believe.<br /><br />While the film is both filthy and raunchy at times, the foundation of
Bridesmaids lies within the relationship between Annie and Lillian.
Their chemistry along with the way they both screw up their lives when
they&#x27;re away from one another is the heart and soul of the film.
Lillian&#x27;s marriage falling apart is kind of a given just with how
eccentric each character in the main cast is, but Annie&#x27;s depression,
downward spiral, and inability to drive herself forward rather than
continuously pushing herself back is key to giving the film an
emotional kick that isn&#x27;t even hinted at in the trailers. Melissa
McCarthy steals nearly every scene that she&#x27;s in thanks to her
outrageous antics and incredibly high self esteem. Nearly every one of
the bridesmaids gets a good laugh at some point in the film even if a
few of them (Reno! 911&#x27;s Wendi McLendon-Covey and The Office&#x27;s Ellie
Kemper) don&#x27;t get as much screen time as others.<br /><br />Bridesmaids almost felt like it was stronger during its more dramatic
and softhearted sequences in comparison to the overall comedic
atmosphere of the rest of the film, which is weird since it is
absolutely a comedy. While the obscene and sometimes scatological jokes
used in the film were mostly original in execution and chuckle-worthy
at times, it somehow all just felt very familiar to me. The Brazilian
food that gave them all food poisoning felt like it borrowed heavily
from Dumb &#x26; Dumber, the Wilson Phillips joke was funnier in Harold &#x26;
Kumar Go to White Castle, while most of the scenes on the airplane
seemed to offer a female version of a scene straight out of Planes,
Trains, and Automobiles with more profanity. Then there&#x27;s the film
itself which was like Wedding Crashers if seen through the eyes of the
women in the actual wedding. I guess on one hand, that isn&#x27;t
necessarily a bad thing. All of those comedies are rather exceptional
while at least two of them would be considered classics, but that sense
of familiarity was still there like D&#xE9;j&#xE0; vu sneaking up behind you and
trying to tickle you while spewing a constant string of F-bombs.<br /><br />Bridesmaids is a dirty, vulgar, over the top comedy that attempts to
affect your limits of compassion just as much as the extent of your
hilarity. While some of the gross-out humor came off as a little much
at times, Kristen Wiig is able to prove just how talented she really
is. It is at least able to offer an R-rated comedy that both sexes will
enjoy, which is more that can be said for most PG-13 romantic comedies.
Bridesmaids is an entertaining stumble into borderline comedic genius
that will keep people talking about it long after it&#x27;s relevant.
