It&#x27;s another one-idea movie that isn&#x27;t funny and has some really bad
acting! It must be embarrassing for such a talented actress as Melissa
McCarthy to be in such a piece of excrement. Kristen Wiig is untalented
and not funny (like her characters on SNL). Maya Rudolph is as
obnoxious as usual. The other girls are instantly forgettable (thank
God).<br /><br />Kristen Wiig&#x27;s script is LOUSY. It rates right down there with Ishtar.
They should have hired a real writer. The jokes are forced. They might
be funny if you&#x27;re 12 years old and get a giggle out of bathroom humor.
And when is Hollywood going to realize that &#x22;Akward&#x22; character
reactions aren&#x27;t funny. They haven&#x27;t learned it since Jerry Lewis did
them all 50 years ago!<br /><br />I can&#x27;t believe I actually bought the Blu-Ray for my wife. I can never
get those 2 hours of my life, or my money back. I wanted to walk out,
but then I wold have been in my front yard watching the grass
grow....which would have been FAR more interesting!
