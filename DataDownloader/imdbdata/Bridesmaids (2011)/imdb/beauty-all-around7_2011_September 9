The very beginning of the movie already warns the viewer about what it
is going to be. An intelligent mind will never find this thing funny
but rather disgusting. It was disgusting, not funny. The characters and
the situations were pitiful and all I was feeling was pity and disgust
throughout the whole movie. This movie can&#x27;t be called a comedy. This
is a drama and tragedy. I am shocked how this movie is rated so well. I
am shocked by the humans. Ugly characters with low kind of speech and
humor that makes you frown instead of laughing. I really like light
funny stories to spend some easy fun time but this was far from
entertaining. It became funny at 1 hour 46 minutes.
