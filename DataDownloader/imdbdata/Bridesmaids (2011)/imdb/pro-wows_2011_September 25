Well if your a guy this is just another Chick flick just like all the
others. Its watchable I Guess but there&#x27;s nothing really funny about
it. Some people compare it to the Hangover but with chicks and its not
even close.<br /><br />What Disappointed me is that right when I thought the movie was going
to get Good. It just went back to the same boring chick flick stuff. It
stays the same the entire movie. The movie didn&#x27;t even have a climax or
a resolution. I don&#x27;t know just really bad writing. A Stale chick
flick.<br /><br />Anyways I mean what do you expect its clearly a run of the mill chick
flick. A lot of critics point it out being funny even for guys. But I
Don&#x27;t know my girlfriend is really into chick flicks and even at the
end of it she said it really wasn&#x27;t as funny as I thought it was going
to be.<br /><br />I give it a 6 because maybe its acceptable for females. The whole thing
just feels amateur and uninspired. Trying to ride off of what hangover
was but missing everything good about that movie.
