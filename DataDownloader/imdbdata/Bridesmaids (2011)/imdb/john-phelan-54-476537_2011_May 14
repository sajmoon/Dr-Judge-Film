I should have known. After seeing Ms. Wiig&#x27;s appearance on &#x22;The Daily
Show,&#x22; during which she admitted having to buy and consult a book on
&#x22;how to write a screenplay&#x22; prior to creating &#x22;Bridesmaids,&#x22; I still
went ahead and shelled out the money for a ticket. And, as I suspected,
the movie came off as a less than sure collection of scenes trying
desperately to inflate a plot.<br /><br />And don&#x27;t get me wrong, some of those scenes are hysterical. But this
movie doesn&#x27;t know what it wants to be, and so suffers from the same
malaise that afflicts the lead character, Annie: drift.<br /><br />I believe Kristen Wiig has better material in her future. But she&#x27;s got
to move from the neat form of sketch comedy to the more challenging,
and longer, form of feature film with her storytelling talents intact.
