It&#x27;s sad that we&#x27;ve come down to the idea that comedy has to be vulgar,
crude and about sex! Movies like this insult the intelligence of anyone
above the age of 12. DO NOT make the same mistake I made by wasting
your money and over 2 hours of your life by supporting this movie. I
suggest sticking your head in a toilet bowl and flushing it repeatedly
instead! You have to write 10 lines in order to get your comments
posted, this is a hard thing to do when there is nothing good to say
about something so bad. Some of the scenes in this movie are down right
disgusting especially if you our eating. Most of the men in the theater
were looking at their phones hoping that time would leap ahead so they
could find a building to jump off!
