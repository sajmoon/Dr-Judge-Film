This movie is terrible. Rudolph is good (as she is in everything) but
everything else is contrived nonsense. I heard it was a &#x22;girl&#x27;s The
Hangover&#x22; - but that couldn&#x27;t be farther from the truth (except that
they ripped characters and plot lines from The Hangover). <br /><br />At least in The Hangover you could suspend your disbelief while you
were watching the film. In hindsight, some it seems ridiculous, but
almost all of the comic elements of this film are completely
ridiculous. For example - the roommate brother/sister team? No one
believes there are any humans on the planet like that. Every time they
were on the screen it took me completely away from the film.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t see it.
