After seeing all of the reviews for this movie, I couldn&#x27;t wait to see
it. It got so many great reviews, not only from IMDb, but from my
friends. The first 10 minutes of the movie passed and I already wanted
to leave. Nonetheless, I stayed, hoping that something drastically
funny would occur. Boy was I wrong! After realizing the movie had been
playing for an hour, I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to get funny. I walked out
and got my money back (thank goodness). This was a sad attempt at
humor. Yes, I realize that everyone&#x27;s sense of humor is different, but
I do not understand how anyone in their right mind could think this
movie was even the slightest bit funny. Not only was it not funny, but
all of the attempts at &#x22;humor&#x22; were just down right nasty! I&#x27;m not
prude and some of the jokes made me feel uncomfortable, and I found
myself thinking: &#x22;Were the people who wrote this script on crack?&#x22; One
of the worst movies I have ever seen. If I could give 0 stars I would.
Please save your money for some other movie. *To all the people who
couldn&#x27;t get their money back I am genuinely sorry!
