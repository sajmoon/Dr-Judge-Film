I thought the acting was outstanding, the writing was superb - funniest
movie I&#x27;ve seen in a long time. My husband and I both thought it was
hilarious and both consider it a 10. The whole theater was laughing
their @#&#x26;!&#x26;% off!!! There really wasn&#x27;t a weak link in the acting and
the movie never slowed down. It just kept going and going with the
laughs. I guarantee this will be a classic for future brides, best
friends, and all others that need a laugh. Melissa McCarthy was
outstanding. Aside from Kristen Wiig, she made the movie. Everyone&#x27;s
role fit them perfectly and they didn&#x27;t leave it with a weak ending. It
was funny to the end.
