Bridesmaids<br /><br />2:10 mins of teeth itching drivel. I enjoy a good comedy i really do.
this wasn&#x27;t one it was desperate, obvious and weak. So much talent in
this film to many really talented comedy actors and actresses and yet
it was an effort to sit through it. Cheap Cheap jokes, vomit, pooh and
schoolgirl competitiveness. Worst comedy since the mister Magoo film,
Scooby doo or Dennis the Mennis. Baring in mind that they were all
rubbish children&#x27;s films. What irks me is all of the review on IMDb and
all of the adverts that lead me to download this dross EVEN THOUGH I
KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE RUBBISH!!!!<br /><br />What I don&#x27;t understand is how it rated so high on IMDb if i could give
it a negative number is would and it would be in the high double
figures.
