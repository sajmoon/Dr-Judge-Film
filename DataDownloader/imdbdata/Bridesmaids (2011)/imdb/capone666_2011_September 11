Bridesmaids<br /><br />Being a bride can be stressful, but just how chaotic can it be that you
need multiple maids to clean up after you?<br /><br />And while the bride-to-be in this comedy is tidy, her maid of honor
could use some domestic help.<br /><br />When her childhood friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) gets engaged,
scatterbrained Annie (Kristen Wiig) is chosen to be maid of honor.<br /><br />When the events that she has planned go terribly awry, however, a more
influential bridesmaid (Rose Byrne) steps up and commandeers the party
planning duties, along with some of Annie&#x27;s ideas.<br /><br />Feeling neglected and upstaged, Annie begins to act out in idiotic ways
that cause a rift in her friendship with Lillian.<br /><br />With a comedic cast, relatable relationship references, and sustainable
unisex jokes throughout, Bridesmaids is a true creditable comedy.<br /><br />As for those people who don&#x27;t think that women can be funny, obviously
you&#x27;ve never seen a female ventriloquist. (Green Light)
