This film is about a woman who is asked to be the maid of honor at her
friend&#x27;s wedding. Her life spirals downwards from then on.<br /><br />&#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; is said to be the female version of &#x22;The Hangover&#x22;,
because apparently it is outrageously funny. With that expectation in
my head, I found &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; a little disappointing. &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22;
does have laugh out loud moments, which consists of very crude toilet
humour.<br /><br />Some say that comedies do not need character development, but in this
film you really need some character development, as it is about the
interaction of a group of newly met friends. Unfortunately, there is
little character development, so I don&#x27;t really know who the
bridesmaids really are. Helen is the only bridesmaid that stands out,
all the others are just to fill up the screen space or to make Kristen
Wiig pretty. The story is quite slow for a comedy, and a joke is
repeated over and over for minutes. It appears to me that &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22;
is just a vessel for a high profile one man band comedy for Kristen
Wiig. I think &#x22;Bridesmaids&#x22; is overrated, but still enjoyable.
