my wife and I sat through this very very unfunny movie absolutely
unable to understand what anyone found appealing in it. it was unfunny
in so many ways as to define description. I don&#x27;t ever even want to
know anyone who liked this movie. The movie was as ugly as the bride&#x27;s
dress and all i can say is that i am happy for all the actors who
didn&#x27;t get to do this movie. I am sorry but vulgar material is vulgar
and guess what not really funny. vulgar it is not funny with guys and
not funny with women or children. vulgar is called vulgar because it is
crude and unfunny. and profanity from children does not leave people
rolling in the isles either. disrespectful and course language is not a
million laughs ( hello Mr Aptow ) to most folks so why do we have to
listen to it in movies.
