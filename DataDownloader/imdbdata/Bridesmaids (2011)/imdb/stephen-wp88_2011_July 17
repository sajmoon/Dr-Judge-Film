For this film to work it has to be funny - and it isn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ll pretty
much laugh at anything - I even thought Tropic Thunder was hilarious,
Satan&#x27;s Alley, now thats funny. But I sat through this and didn&#x27;t
laugh, smirk or smile once. Its not that i don&#x27;t get Kristen Wiig, in
fact I think she steals her scenes in Knocked Up and Forgetting Sarah
Marshall, where she is fantastic (&#x22;Its not a competition, but you&#x27;re
best&#x22;). She&#x27;s also probably the best thing in Paul as a god bothering
hillbilly.<br /><br />But why doesn&#x27;t this film work for me? Well it just isn&#x27;t funny -
there&#x27;s no genuine humour in someone being drugged up and doing bad
things on a plane, or people getting food poisoning and needing to
defecate on the street. You would expect a lot from the people who put
together this movie but they don&#x27;t deliver.
