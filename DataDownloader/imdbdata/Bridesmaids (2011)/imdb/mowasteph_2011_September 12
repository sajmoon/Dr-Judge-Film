What was all the buzz about this movie? What a piece of crap. First
off, no one would ever act like Kristen Wiig&#x27;s character does...and if
they actually did, no one would have anything to do with her. I like
Wiig on SNL but her character was 100% unlikable in this. Aren&#x27;t you
supposed to like the lead character? The rest of the characters were
clich&#xE9;s. Only Maya Rudolph showed any class. The food poisoning scene
was just stupid and gross and not very funny. I thought the Megan
character was pretty funny...but on further reflection, only
marginally. The guy who played the cop was good. But do you really
think he&#x27;d like Annie? Run away, Officer! Run away from this loser
woman right now! Everyone else...run away from this movie.
