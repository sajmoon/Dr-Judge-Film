Whereas the cover says it is hilarious, it is not. Not once did even a
tiny smile appear on our faces when my friend and I watched it. It was
so boring that at some point, my friend took off multiple times to make
tea, wash the dishes, hang out the wash, et cetera, just so she would
not have to watch.<br /><br />The rivalry the cover speaks of is not at all funny. Instead, it is
nasty. It brings an uncomfortable atmosphere to the movie. It is all
about how selfish these girls are.<br /><br />The main character is no fun at all. She is boring to watch and has no
appeal whatsoever. The other characters are not very attractive to
watch either. There is no fun, no humor at all in this movie; only
selfishness and egotism.<br /><br />You can be certain to lose your good mood if you watch this movie.
