After we are finished talking about the gross moments, the riotous
laughter, and a few knockout performances, there is going to need to be
a fair evaluation of this movie. I think it is going to be a good one. <br /><br />There were numerous LOLian moments. The fitting room. The airplane. Air
Marshall John. John Hamm. &#x22;Hold On.&#x22; And McCarthy and Wiig turn in some
magnificent acting and substance. Wiig does a good job harnessing the
propulsion of the movie, even when it becomes a flaw. There are large
pieces of material that could be edited out, but Wiig still manages to
fill the screen with the same lovable awkwardness that audiences have
started to appreciate. One of BRIDESMAIDS&#x27; best qualities is the
ensemble energy. The women work well together (and the unnecessary
material should have been swapped for more time with them) and every
character has unique energy. This is exactly what makes BRIDESMAIDS
crucial as genre evolution. This level of female ensemble acting in
contemporary comedy has not been produced to this extent. It&#x27;s a
marvelous group performance and a big step forward. <br /><br />The script is owed a certain due. The use of repetition and stop-start
dialogue is commendable, but the silence is what drives BRIDESMAIDS.
They seem to know every smart-ass retort, but nothing can stand up to
silence when they just have nothing to say. It&#x27;s used very well. The
scene where Ms. Wiig makes and eats a cupcake is one of the most
arresting examples of loneliness, loneliness amongst everything, that
has been recently seen. In fact, Ms. Wiig crafts herself as a repugnant
character, wasteful and constantly waiting for pity. Her jealousy
towards the enigmatic Helen is taken much too far (even in the film)
and, like Woody Allen writing his own flaws into his own characters,
here we see an embarrassing character in need of a Rosebud (baking
shop). <br /><br />As the main themes are clearly lined out as &#x22;change v. same,&#x22; we never
end up seeing a title bout. There are some apologies and everybody gets
to the wedding. But will they be any better off when the sequel comes
out? Will Helen still be the clueless self-righteous turd that she is?
Will Annie be baking? and not being the most subtly evil twirp that she
was here? Maybe we will find out. <br /><br />Until then, enjoy something very close to Judd Apatow. Enjoy some truly
unique comedy coming from a great gaggle of females. And Enjoy seeing
girls be girls, cycling through dismay and distaste.<br /><br />63.232
