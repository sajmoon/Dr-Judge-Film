I can&#x27;t believe that this is what passes for comedy nowadays. This is a
depressing story of a girl who hits rock bottom and keeps falling. And
falling. And falling. And just when you think it can&#x27;t get any more
miserable or depressing it does. It just drags and drags in a joyless
manner the majority of the time. There are maybe two laughs the whole
time and the rest of the movie you&#x27;re cringing at the ridiculous things
the main character does and the stupid way she ruins all the good
things in her life. The only thing that&#x27;s actually funny is the fat
girl. Overall I think only sadistic people could enjoy this movie. Just
don&#x27;t see it if you don&#x27;t want to see people getting diarrhea in their
bridesmaid&#x27;s dress.
