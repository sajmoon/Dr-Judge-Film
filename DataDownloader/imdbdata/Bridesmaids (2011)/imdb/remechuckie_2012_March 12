I&#x27;m so, so disappointed. I wasn&#x27;t that fussed about watching this but
all my friends said it was hilarious, so many great reviews etc that in
the end I couldn&#x27;t wait to see it and was really looking forward to it.
After renting it on iTunes at the bargain price of &#xA3;3.49(!), I settled
down expecting to enjoy a humorous couple of hours. This didn&#x27;t happen
and I feel cheated. <br /><br />I&#x27;ve given the film 4/10, three of these points are for Melissa
McCarthy who plays Megan and provides all of the decent comedy moments
and is possibly the only likable character in the entire film. <br /><br />The thing with films like this is that you need to like the characters,
you need to want to see the downtrodden, unlucky in life and love
underdog get their day in the sun and the happy ending. Unfortunately,
Annie (Kristen Wiig) was such a bitter, twisted, jealous, vindictive
cow that I was hoping more that she&#x27;d get hit by a truck. I didn&#x27;t want
to see her get a happy ending, she didn&#x27;t deserve one. She was vile.
I&#x27;d usually be laughing my head off in a scene like the one at the
bridal shower but because the tone of the film is so nasty (struggling
to find a better word but that&#x27;s just what it is) I was completely
stone faced. <br /><br />I didn&#x27;t find the bathroom scenes offensive but I don&#x27;t think they
worked well at all and again, failed to make me laugh - I think it was
a poor attempt to get a giggle and, again, where I&#x27;d be laughing in
another film, this just didn&#x27;t work. <br /><br />The writing is pretty bad, the dialogue is rubbish. Looks like a lot is
improvised which can be brilliant with some actors, not with these. It
just drew out an already boring scene and made me realise how damn
irritating Kristen Wiig is.<br /><br />Just a shoddy, hackneyed, poor film. Don&#x27;t believe the hype!
