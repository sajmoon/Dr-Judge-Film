We set out to watch the female equivalent of The Hangover, we were
wrong. And gladly so. This film was far more entertaining than we
expected. At the time of viewing IMDb rating was only a 7, so this left
us with a low expectation. Pleasantly surprised, and Kristen Wig was
fantastic. We finished up wondering what all those who rated this lowly
actually expected. Great movie, entertaining and light. The laughs were
nicely spread out through the movie and at no stage did it lag. Some
great supporting cast with the guy from the English TV series The IT
crowd and also Matt Lucas from Little Britain. Don&#x27;t expect them to be
funnier or get too much limelight. the star of the show is Wiig.
Obviously a very talented and underrated artist, writer, comedienne,
actress, producer and not bad on the eye either.
