I was so so excited for this movie, I was sure it was going to be
hilarious. But at the end I was left somewhat disgusted and severely
disappointed. This movie fell into the ever growing group of movies
that claimed to be &#x22; as funny as the hangover!&#x22;, and what a surprise,
like all the others, its not. This movie did have a few funny moments,
I can&#x27;t lie. Also a cast of great actors who played their various
characters really well. But the story line seemed sorely lacking
material and dimension, which they seemed to try and make up for/cover
up with really long scenes. They would consist of a couple jokes that
stretched on and on, It constantly got to the point where if a scene
started and I was laughing or interested by the end I was just left
wondering how long this movie was and when somethings going to happen.
I don&#x27;t know what everyone else finds so hilarious, but I&#x27;m passed
drawing on magazines or books making the cartoons and models poop like
I did when I was seven, and I graduated high school a few years ago, so
I feel like I&#x27;ve heard all these sex jokes before. So all in all this
movie just wasn&#x27;t for me.
