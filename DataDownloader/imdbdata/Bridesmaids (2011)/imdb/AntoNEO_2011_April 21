My friends invited me to a preview screening of Bridesmaids last night,
and I accepted the invitation with a sense of cautious optimism. The
trailer for the film admittedly didn&#x27;t do much for me, but I was
intrigued by the concept of a female-driven Apatow film. Ultimately, I
went into the theater with modest expectations, hoping to get a few
good laughs out of it.<br /><br />By the time we came out of the theater, my three friends and I had
smiles plastered across our faces, and we couldn&#x27;t stop talking about
the film for the next couple hours. We all loved it. I think it easily
ranks with the best of the Apatow productions, and it might even be my
personal favorite. Like all of Apatow&#x27;s productions, there are
admittedly scenes that arguably go a little too far or a little too
long, but that&#x27;s a small criticism when the film successfully fires on
so many other cylinders.<br /><br />To start with, the film is hilarious, and I think the comedy far
exceeds the standalone bits shown in the trailer. Scene after scene is
filled with humorous and often sidesplitting moments, and they had the
theater in an uproar during the screening. I can&#x27;t say enough about
Kristen Wiig. Prior to this, I&#x27;ve always liked her to some extent but
never really loved her. I think she&#x27;s good at what she does, but I
wasn&#x27;t sure her shtick could sustain an entire film. Would her passive
aggressive wit get old? Is it the only note she can play? Can she
handle anything more dramatic? Ultimately, she blew me away in this
film. Not only is she consistently and uniquely funny, but her
character is surprisingly well-developed, and Wiig brings the character
to vibrant and dynamic life on-screen.<br /><br />And this brings me to my next point about Bridesmaids: the film has a
surprising amount of depth that completely caught me off guard.
Bridesmaids isn&#x27;t a quickie 80-minute gag fest by any stretch of the
imagination; it&#x27;s actually a leisurely paced 2-hour character-driven
comedy that takes time to develop its characters and establish the
various relationships and resultant conflicts between them. Ultimately,
the film ends up being quite heartfelt and even rather sad in places.
Despite the over-the-top antics shown in the trailer, the themes that
the film explores are actually quite grounded. Kristen Wiig&#x27;s character
is someone who is feeling completely let down by life, which is a place
we&#x27;ve all been, and the personal journey of her character resonated
strongly for me. While her character is easily the most well-developed
of the bunch, even the other bridesmaids ultimately show some
three-dimensionality as well, despite the fact that they are sometimes
initially introduced as two-dimensional caricatures.<br /><br />Ultimately, Bridesmaids was one of the most enjoyable comedies I&#x27;ve
seen in a long time. It&#x27;s certainly not perfect: it could probably do
with some editing, there might be a few too many subplots (some of
which are left unexplored), and it arguably goes too over-the-top at
times, but everything else about the film works so well that these
complaints are little more than nitpicks. While I applaud everyone
involved in the production, it is Kristen Wiig who deserves the most
accolades. As co-writer and lead actress, she plays a huge part in the
film&#x27;s success, and I sincerely hope this film puts her on the
Hollywood map, as I would love to see more from her in the future.
Whatever the case may be, Bridesmaids certainly makes for a successful
maiden voyage for her into the world of feature-film comedies.
