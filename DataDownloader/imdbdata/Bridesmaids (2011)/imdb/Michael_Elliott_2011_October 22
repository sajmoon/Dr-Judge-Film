Bridesmaids (2011) <br /><br />** (out of 4) <br /><br />Annie (Fristen Wiig) finds her life falling apart all around her once
her business goes down the drain. Not only that but she&#x27;s stuck with
two horrible roommates, has no money, a crummy job and is in a
relationship with a guy who wants one thing only. Annie thinks
everything is about to change when her lifelong friend announces she&#x27;s
getting married and wants her to be the maid of honor but soon Annie
finds herself battling with one of the bridesmaids. I&#x27;ll have to admit
right now that I&#x27;m really not sure what all the hype was about. I&#x27;m
sure some might say that the humor just escaped me because I&#x27;m a male
but I think that would be tad bit unfair. I mean, I&#x27;m sure plenty of
women enjoy male-buddy movies so I really don&#x27;t think ones sex should
matter. I had really high hopes for this comedy but throughout the
movie it just seemed like I kept waiting for something funny to happen.
There were a few scenes that had a smile on my face but there wasn&#x27;t a
single time where I really laughed out loud. I think the biggest
problem I had with the comedy was that it was just so forced and so
fake that not for a second could I find it funny. Just take a look at a
sequence where the women are shopping for dresses after eating at a
restaurant. They end up getting food poisoning and need to rush the
bathroom but there&#x27;s only one toilet with three women fighting over it.
This is the gross-out scene that all R-rated comedies must have these
days but it doesn&#x27;t work. Also, there&#x27;s a scene later in the movie
where the group is on a plane and Annie, the only one stuck in coach,
ends up getting the plane landed because of her actions. I won&#x27;t spoil
what she does exactly but once again it&#x27;s just so over-the-top that you
can&#x27;t take it serious or laugh at it. I found the entire story to have
wannabe touching scenes but none of them worked because they were just
so corny and by the numbers. I mean, is there anyone alive whose not
going to see the ending coming? The one spark in the film came from
Chris O&#x27;Dowd who plays an officer who starts a relationship with Annie.
I thought the quieter moments between the two were the best parts of
the film and it&#x27;s a shame they didn&#x27;t have more of it. With all of that
said, BRIDESMAIDS is still an easy film to sit back and watch. It&#x27;s
certainly not horrible but I just think it should have been better.
Considering it was a huge hit obviously many people loved it but I&#x27;m
just not one of them.
