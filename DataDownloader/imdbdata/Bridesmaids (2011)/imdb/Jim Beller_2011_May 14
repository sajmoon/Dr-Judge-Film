I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this film. My wife and I were
laughing out loud almost continuously throughout the entire film. I
never realized from Saturday Night Live what an enormous talent Kristen
Wiig is. <br /><br />The supporting cast is also excellent, especially Maya Rudolph, Melissa
McCarthy, Rose Byrne, and Chris O&#x27;Dowd. The supporting actress who
really stole a lot of our attention was Melissa McCarthy (Molly from
TV&#x27;s Mike and Molly). Her performance was completely uninhibited and
frequently, fall in the aisle, hilarious. However, the scene outside
the bridal shop with Maya Rudolph will be the one you will long
remember after the movie is over.<br /><br />This is not a chick flick although it does star very talented women and
the men, except of Chris O&#x27;Dowd, are mostly secondary. If this film is
not an enormous hit, it will be because of men who refuse to see it.
For those men who can enjoy a movie that doesn&#x27;t include over the top
action, you will be rewarded for seeing this film.<br /><br />My wife and I enjoyed Hangover very much and this film will be compared
to it. Some time has past since we saw it so it may be unfair to
compare it with this film that is so clear in our minds. However, we
both think this movie is even better than Hangover. If you&#x27;re not a
prude, we strongly recommend you seeing this movie.
