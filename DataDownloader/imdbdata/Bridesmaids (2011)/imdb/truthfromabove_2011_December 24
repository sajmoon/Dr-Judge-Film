Not gonna put in any spoilers, but i will say that i am a pretty easily
amused comedy watcher. I just didn&#x27;t see it in this movie, in my
opinion there was about 5 minutes of funny material and the rest was
awkward. I think i understood what they were trying to do, they just
fell short.. I don&#x27;t know if its because the all woman cast that people
have lowered their standards or what, but don&#x27;t waste your time. My
wife and her friends all seemed to enjoy it, but all the husbands were
on the same page of thinking this movie was crap. <br /><br />With that being said, i still give it a five, I&#x27;ve seen much much
worse.
