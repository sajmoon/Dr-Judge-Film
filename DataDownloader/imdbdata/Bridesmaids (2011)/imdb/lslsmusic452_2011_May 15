This movie was SO AWFUL it gave me a headache. ANYONE who thinks this
is humor is out of their mind. It is grotesquely sad to me that in this
day and age &#x22;humor&#x22; has resorted to being a fart, or vomit, or toilet
scenes, or comments about body parts and secretion. It&#x27;s really just
disgusting and shows a COMPLETE lack of originality and talent in
writers. The scene with the women trying on dresses and getting sick is
revolting and gratuitous at best. I found the entire film degrading to
women and vile child&#x27;s play. AND TWO HOURS LONG?!!!!! ARE YOU KIDDING
ME???? I had an expectation that it would be silly but just went for a
laugh. What I got was depressed and a headache. What is most depressing
is that sadly, this generation sees this as humor. And they will never
know the likes of great comedic writing and true humor that comes from
situation and from brains and true wit. Someone should shoot Jud
Apatow. But instead, like many other untalented children in Hollywood -
he was probably rewarded with millions in a paycheck and residuals. Oy
evay how I long for class and dignity of the &#x22;good old days&#x22;.
