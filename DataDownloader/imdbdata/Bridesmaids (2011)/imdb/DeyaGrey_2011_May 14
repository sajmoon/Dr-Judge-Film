Well I&#x27;d like to point out that this is not an ordinary comedy which we
see nowadays. This is a buddy comedy in disguise - played by women.
These women are all unique, weird and funny. The things that happened
to them and the things they do are hilarious! If I ever get married I
wan&#x27;t to have the same bridesmaids! I&#x27;m not a fan of comedies in
general, but this one really made my day. GUYS don&#x27;t be deceived, it&#x27;s
not a horrible romantic comedy for women they usually made, but it&#x27;s
actually also for you! These actresses were just brilliant, the plot is
well done and I can really say it&#x27;s my favorite comedy of the year! I&#x27;m
giving it 9/10
