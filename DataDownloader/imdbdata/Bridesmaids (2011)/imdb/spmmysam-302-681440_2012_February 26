do not be fooled by the positive rating this film has. This is a
terrible film. I have a broad sense of humour and can laugh at many
things, but this is so lame it hurts. The film is so unfunny, you keep
waiting hoping it will get better but it doesn&#x27;t. Not only is the
humour terrible but the plot is very one dimensional and it keeps
dragging on for 2 hours! The main character (Kristen Wiig who co-wrote
this tripe) is very frustrating and none of the characters are
believable. What were Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo thinking??!! This
is a very poorly written piece of film- making. Save yourself, don&#x27;t be
fooled by the high rating on IMDb, I usually trust IMDb for it&#x27;s
ratings but this one is definitely wrong, at absolute most about a
3/10. absolutely awful. Avoid at all costs!
