Competition between the maid of honor and a bridesmaid, over who is the
bride&#x27;s best friend, threatens to upend the life of an out-of-work
pastry chef.<br /><br />I hate to say this, but I laughed many times watching this film. I had
some pretty low expectations, thinking it would be a &#x22;chick flick&#x22;. It
could not have been farther from that. This was totally a Judd Apatow
film.<br /><br />Women with the mile high club? Food poisoning leading to using the sink
as a toilet? Oh my! An bonus points for being set in Wisconsin,
although I can tell you that living here for 30 years that our state
does not look anything like what you see in this movie.
