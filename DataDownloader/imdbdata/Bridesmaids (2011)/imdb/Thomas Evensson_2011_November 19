I could go on and on about this movie and how bad every aspect of it
is. I won&#x27;t, because others have covered it to perfection; the plot is
beyond dumb, the actors are terrible and there&#x27;s absolutely No. Humor.
At. All. in this movie (unless you happen to laugh at girls farting,
belching, throwing up). One-dimensional characters that lead lives that
are so far from reality it&#x27;s amazing. Take for instance Annie (Wiig)
and her job at the jewelery store... I assume talking to the customers
like she does is supposed to generate laughter. It doesn&#x27;t, believe me.<br /><br />Drop your tickets/rentals and take two steps back! <br /><br />And yes, my wife hated it as well.
