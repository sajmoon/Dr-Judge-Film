I saw the previews for this movie and thought to myself, wow this seems
like the female version of the HangOver. While it was not along the
same plot as the HangOver, it was about the moments leading up to the
wedding. At first I looked around the theater and noticed it was 95%
women and I started to feel like I had made a mistake. But by the end I
was pleasantly surprised that there was a lot good humor involved. Some
of it would be considered guy humor, but actually had all the women in
the theater laughing their asses off. There is a bit chick flick
element to it between the main character and a guy, but it is such a
small part of the movie that I would say it&#x27;s about 85% comedy and 15%
romance/chick flick. So as a guy, I can honestly say I enjoyed the
movie. Most of these types of movies are about guys making complete
asses out of themselves and you almost never see the same from women.
Hollywood always likes to make women seem perfect, but you see women
making crude remarks about their own genitals and it&#x27;s nice to see that
women can be funny in this regard as well. I think this was a great
movie for female humor, because I have long thought that comedy was
dominated by male actors and I am just waiting for some women to jump
in there and start paving the way. Good job on this movie!
