This is one of the best movies in this genre. The research facility
provides a nice and scary high-tech atmosphere. An excellent soundtrack
by Marilyn Manson that really suits the environment. The story is
definitely interesting and keeps you focused. Flawless acting.<br /><br />One of the few things I find bad about Resident Evil is the excessive
amount of zombies towards the end of the movie. IMHO 'Monsters' should
come unexpected and in limited amounts to make it more thrilling. The
huge mutant monster towards the very end could possibly be left out of
changed to give it a bit more credibility.<br /><br />I also find the Red Queen mainframe computer 'laser' protection system
somewhat stupid but this is a minor defect.<br /><br />A similar scenery and feeling can be found in the game Half-Life, so if
you enjoyed playing that you will probably like this movie.
