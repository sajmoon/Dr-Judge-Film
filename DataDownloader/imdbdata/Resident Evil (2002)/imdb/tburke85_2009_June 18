Resident Evil is a decent movie based on a video game but not the
greatest from director Paul W.S. Anderson who for the most part gives
fans of the game what they come to except from these type of films. The
cast are good in their roles including Milla Jovovich, Michelle
Rodriguez, Eric Mabius, James Purefoy, Martin Crews, and Colin Salmon
in a brief extended appearance. The action which is pretty much non
stop once they reach the Hive involving people mostly shooting at
zombies and creatures created by the T-Virus are well executed. The
special effects are impressive but at times you can definitely tell
it&#x27;s CG. The zombies and the Licker look terrifying like something out
of your worst nightmares. Well done. The dialogue however wasn&#x27;t the
greatest at times, it was a little predictable, and some characters are
written out too soon for you to care about whether they survive or not.
Depite its flaws though overall Resident Evil is decent with enough
action, gruesome deaths, impressive special effects, some suspense, and
good performances by the cast who make it worth watching but this movie
could&#x27;ve been better.
