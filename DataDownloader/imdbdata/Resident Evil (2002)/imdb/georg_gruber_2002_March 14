I just saw the movie in a sneak preview. I'm really really into the video
game. I love it.<br /><br />The movie is great if you know the game. If you don't you'll also have a
lot
of fun. It's always a little risky to make a movie from a video game or
comic but the film crew got it pretty right from the beginning.<br /><br />The story is ok, the set is great. The atmosphere in the movie is quite
frightening! There are some shocking scenes in it - the audience is
screaming
;-)<br /><br />Overall I have to say that the actors do a fair job. IMHO the movie is a
little short - there could have been much more action in it. Maybe the
wanted to save it for RE 2?<br /><br />Well, bloody funny, RE is the best horror/action combo in the last time. If
you like horror flicks, get ready for a hell of a ride!<br /><br />7 + 1 (game bonus) = 8/10<br /><br />See the movie, play the great game!
