&quot;Resident Evil&quot; Is the best video game movie. Though the movie has no
characters from the  games it still holds true to what the games are all
about. The acting was perfect for the situations that the charactrs were
in,
and they kept it kind of light at some points. If you liked the games
you'll
like the movie more.
