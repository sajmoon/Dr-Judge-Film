Never played the game, but I knew of it...and I was expecting crap, but
instead I got some great crap, which I enjoyed immensely. Don't bitch
about
the movie, 'cause it didn't try to be something it's not. You know what
you're in for when you see this kind of film, and I think the majority of
people were pleasantly surprised. I suppose when you look at it, all you
people who are bitching about Resident Evil, are the same people who'll
part
with their well-earned cash next month when another &quot;supposedly crap&quot; film
is released. I guess it's like a car accident. You know there's something
bad going on, but damnit, you just can't help but have a look!!...That's
the
beauty of human nature. And when I say human nature, I mean Hollywood -
and
it has most of us by the nuts!! Roll on Resident Evil 2...cause you all
know
you'll go see it!!
