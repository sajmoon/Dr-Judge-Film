My first thought when I saw the trailer for this movie was that it would be
another terribly acted, cheesy, video-game flick. Man, was I surprised when
I saw this one. Not only does it make you jump twenty times during the film
and makes you have nightmares for a month afterward, it is also a great
movie that is getting decent reviews.  I really like Milla Jovovich in the
lead role, she's absolutely gorgeous and she plays the ass-kicking
superhero
very well. The other characters are good too, but I think some get killed
off too soon.  Otherwise, this movie is a real suspense film that will make
you jump and has an awesome ending too.  Lets hope there's a
sequel.
