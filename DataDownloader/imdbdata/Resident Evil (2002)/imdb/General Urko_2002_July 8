A young woman with amnesia awakens in an empty mansion, alone she is soon
joined by a SWAT team sent to investigate a mysterious occurrence in the
mansions subterranean secret labs. An occurrence which will bring her face
to face with not only her true identity. . . but the undead!<br /><br />In recent cinematic history the number of films based on computer games
has
increased &amp; another such film can be added to the list with Resident Evil.
Its far better than most game-to-film translations but is not exactly a
classic cinematic experience. The games were heavily influenced by the
work
of George Romero &amp; it is this cinematic inspiration which is beneficial to
the movie version. Indeed Romero was approached to make the movie but his
version was deemed too gory for a mainstream audience &amp; hence not
profitable
enough. His replacement was Paul Anderson responsible for such movies as
Event Horizon, Soldier &amp; another computer game adaptation Mortal
Kombat.<br /><br />Anyone familiar with Andersons films will know what to expect. A B movie
version of James Cameron style cinema with characters to match &amp; a
techno-soundtrack. As well as action the games have a suspenseful spooky
atmosphere but the film concentrates on the action elements &amp; yes, with a
techno soundtrack. It doesn't send shivers up your spine nor is it gory
enough for the hardcore horror fan but is entertaining in an undemanding
sort of way.<br /><br />Resident Evil the film is a low budget action-movie 'inspired' by Aliens &amp;
early John Carpenter with zombies instead of extraterrestrials &amp; a SWAT
team
in place of futuristic marines. Also like the work of Cameron it has a
strong female lead in the form of Milla Jovovich (Alice). She is good in a
pretty undemanding role as is Michelle Rodriguez but most of the
characters
are stock action movie types &amp; the audience doesn't care to much what
happens to them.<br /><br />The script whilst not Oscar worthy even by action movie standards does
work.
The main characters amnesia adds to the run of the mill plot &amp; gives a
hook
to drive the movie forward. Just what does Alice have to do with the
situation? The narrative is not based on any single Resident Evil game &amp;
is
all the better for it. The games are heavily plot driven so less surprises
would be up on the screen if it was a faithful adaptation of the console
smash. What it does do is capture the spirit of the game. The silver
screen
version gives us the Umbrella corporation, secret labs, empty mansions,
mutant dogs &amp; of course lots of zombies - all stock elements of the
Resident
Evil series. There are many other familiar locales, scenes &amp; images to
raise
a knowing smile for fans particularly in the sequel prompting
climax.<br /><br />The direction is solid if not groundbreaking &amp; the sets are suitably dark
&amp;
foreboding but Resident Evil doesn't have the superb set design found in
Andersons earlier film Event Horizon. The zombies themselves look OK
although they are not gory enough, a general complaint against the film.
Where are the exploding zombie heads, the result of close range shotgun
fire? Where are the zombie hoards feasting on McHuman Happy Meals? Also
the
CGI effects are pretty poor during the climactic big boss battle but this
is
probably due to budgetary limitations. That said it does end with a great
closing shot which bodes well for the inevitable sequel, just so long as
Anderson is allowed to up the anti in the blood 'n guts stakes. There is
also a nod to the work of Romero to be found in the movies closing
moments.<br /><br />Overall with Resident Evil you get what you pay for. Movies based on
computer games don't exactly promise much &amp; anyone familiar with the work
of
Paul Anderson will not be surprised by this film. A modern B movie with
all
that entails. Its fairly enjoyable rubbish, perfect for a wet-afternoon on
video rather than a must see cinematic experience.
