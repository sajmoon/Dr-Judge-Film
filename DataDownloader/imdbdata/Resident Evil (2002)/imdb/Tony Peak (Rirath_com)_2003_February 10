I was a bit worried this movie would be nothing but another bland horror
attempt, but thankfully Resident Evil is far more. It has the visual
effects, the soundtrack, and the acting to really shine. The story is
complex enough to keep you guessing, but simple enough to let the action
flow. Resident Evil is the truly first good horror movie in quite some
time.<br /><br />The visual effects of RE are quite unique. A beautiful mix of all CG
scenes
with live action really puts that video game fill into it. The often
overlooked fact is that as a RE gamer, you usually have at least in part a
lot of info on the world around you. You know things you couldn't
otherwise
know. For example, how things work, maps, where things are, etc. This
movie
does a great job of keeping the viewer informed in this manner, without
going so far as to ruin the surprises. As for the undead, this movie is
unmatched. The way they move, moan, and even die is exactly what any RE
fan
will expect. It's really good to see the attention to detail.<br /><br />The soundtrack is every bit as cool. In the theater it sounded incredible,
and it certainly doesn't disappoint at home. For all of those out there
watching on some crud two speakers system. you'll miss out. The movie just
doesn't have the same punch without the deep bass and creepy ambient
surround sounds around you. For all of those with the system to handle it,
you'll have a new showcase title for your DVD collection.<br /><br />As for the acting, the downfall of so many movies, it's simply
outstanding.
You really do feel as if you're watching an elite squad of jaded
specialists. It's somewhat like Starship Troopers, in a different setting.
I
really felt convinced of the performances. When they're hurt, they act
hurt.
When they're scared, they're scared. There's very little room for
uncertainty here. If they actors aren't upset about being injured, or
scared
of the death that surrounds them, then it's quite hard for the audience to
be concerned either.<br /><br />Resident Evil manages to not only get the job done, but to excel. It
should
pass all expectations you may have for it, and surprise you a few times as
well. It certainly ranks among my favorites as an action / horror flick. I
honestly believe it would even if it didn't have the game series behind
it.<br /><br />- Rirath_com
