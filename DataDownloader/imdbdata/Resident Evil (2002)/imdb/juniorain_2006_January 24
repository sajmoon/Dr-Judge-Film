This movie is a total crap, there&#39;s nothing related with the game,
which is one of the best video-games series of all time... I guess they
tried to make the movie enjoyable for the people who already knew
Resident Evil and the people who never heard about the game or the
series story.... When they started with that &quot;the hive&quot; bullshit I just
wanted to die! Where was the Resident Evil that I was expecting since I
knew they were making a Resident evil movie?.... If you&#39;re a Resident
Evil fan you can watch this, but don&#39;t expect to see that much of
classical elements of the games here....just an average action
movie....nothing more than it.....
