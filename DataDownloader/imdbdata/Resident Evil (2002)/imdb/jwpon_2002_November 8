2002_November 8 

After reading some of the other comments on this movie, it appears that
the
voting comes down to this: either you thought it was awful, dumb,
unoriginal, etc, or that the movie was actually better than expected.  I
fall into the latter category.  I've never played the Resident Evil video
games, so I really had no expectations for the movie.  I just thought it
might be interesting to see if they could make Resident Evil, the movie,
better than Final Fantasy, the Movie (which was pretty disappointing).
And
surprise - it was much better than I expected.  Somewhat predictable, but
the action scenes were well done, the scares were pretty scary, and I
didn't
think the acting was bad at all.  The movie worked for me.  If you want
some
entertaining distraction for an evening, get a bag of popcorn and pop
this
movie into the DVD player - it's a fun movie.
