The thing I dont get is why they fired George Romero but still managed to
rip off his movies. The whole movie is just cliche's from Romero's zombie
movies and even specific lines of dialogue were taken from Dawn of the Dead.
The film didnt even seem to be about zombie's at all, it was mostly about
the umbrella computer. I think if they would have stuck to the plot of the
games , at least character wise the film would have been alot better. The
film didnt really give me a good sense of the character's like Romero's
films do. I found my self rooting for the zombies to eat everyone just so
the movie would be alittle interesting. The violence wasnt really that great
either. I thought the violence/gore was pretty weak. They never even show
the zombies really eating anyone! Overall I was disappointed but a film
about zombies is better then most of the other horror movies that are out
now a day's. Hopefully if the make a sequel it will be
better.
