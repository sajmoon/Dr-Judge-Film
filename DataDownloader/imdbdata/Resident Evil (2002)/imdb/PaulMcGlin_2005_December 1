I think the reason this film went so wrong is that most people neither
understand nor respect games. They assume that they&#39;re all about
shootin&#39; commi&#39;s or appealing to a persons blood-lust. But that&#39;s not
why I play video-games, I play them because of the participatory
plot-lines.<br /><br />When I was watching the special features for the Resident Evil2 DVD
they all had that gung-ho &quot;we&#39;re gonna whoop some zombie butt&quot;. &quot;This
is the ultimate fight against the power&quot;. &quot;I love Jill&#39;s impatience&quot;.
Bull sh*t! <br /><br />Jill is not a super-heroine! She&#39;s a coward! The first time she sees a
zombie she runs out to Barry shouting &quot;It&#39;s a monster! It&#39;s a monster!
Shoot it!&quot; It&#39;s not that I think women can&#39;t be heroes it&#39;s just that
... Jill isn&#39;t. She&#39;s on that team for her investigatory skills, not
her battle readiness.<br /><br />Both movies were complete failures. If anyone on the project is reading
this remember; We aren&#39;t idiots.
