This movie didn't stand on its own for its messy self it had to steal from
better movies and exhibit a plotless core. I didn't like &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; but
this makes that movie look good by comparison.To think a up-and-coming
actress Michelle Rodriguez in the &quot;Fast and the Furious&quot; would step into the
unrelenting baggage of &quot;Resident Evil&quot;.Likewise Milla Jovovich in &quot;Fifth
Element&quot; and &quot;The Story of Joan of Arc&quot; could waste her valuable energy
here.This is prime example why video games should usually stay that
way.
