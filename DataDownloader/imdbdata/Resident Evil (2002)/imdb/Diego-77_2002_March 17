This is the first really scarry movie in a long time. It's real on the edge
of your seat excitement. Acting is great and the directing is very fast
paced yet it's easy to keep up with the story. Gore and blood are not too
graphic and are often implied rather than actually seen. This is a fun,
scarry and well made movie.
