2002_August 6 

This is one of the dumbest movies i've ever seen. There is no character
development whatsoever so you don't care for any of the characters. You
may
actually find yourself laughing when people you are supposed to care for
die. The only reason to watch this film is for the brief flashes of nudity
of the lovely Mila. Otherwise this is a 2/10 at best.
