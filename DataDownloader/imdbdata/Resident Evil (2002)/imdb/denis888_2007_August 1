I love Milla very much. I like this movie, since this is one of the
best she ever starred in, including the Fifth Element or any other. But
Resident Evil is ever fresh, ever thrilling monster. The plot is
excellent and from the very start the movie holds you glued to the seat
and never allows you even to take a breath in or out. Milla as Alice is
brave, sexy, valiant, courageous, smart, cool and so clever. And then
there is Michelle Rodriguez as Rain, she is so gloomy, so dark and so
demonic, that you hardly avoid falling in love with her too. The very
idea that some large corporation like Umbrella here may control you,
create some terrible genetic monsters and never be responsible for that
is also a big magnet in this film. This is cool, impeccable and great
All 10 / 10
