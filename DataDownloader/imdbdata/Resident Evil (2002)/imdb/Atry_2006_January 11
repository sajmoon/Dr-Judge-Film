2006_January 11 
Firstly, I&#39;m a HUGE fan of the games, and really wanted this to be
good, but i was severely by the many faults in this, sourcing mainly
from crappy direction. Paul Anderson made so many wrong choices with
this, i don&#39;t know where to start. The plot was awful, NO mansion, NO
s.t.a.r.s, NO hunters, NO plant 42, NO Chris, Jill, Wesker, Barry,
Rebecca... you know what, it would be easier to list what there was.
Their was the T-virus, a virus developed by the Umbrella Corporation
(yes they&#39;re&#39;e there) in a lab called &#39;The Hive&#39; for medical purposes,
but it escapes and changes all the workers into zombies. Which brings
me onto one of the biggest mistakes, the RED QUEEN. Some
child-holographic-computer with a bad accent &#39;controlling&#39; the Hive
(come on, would you really put millions of pounds worth of equipment in
the hands of a computer!) The suppose-to-be-eerie little girl sound
like something a teenager would think up for some school story he cant
be assed to do. I mean, come on! Anyway, the scientist are dead and we
meet Alice, who can&#39;t remember anything and needs to find out what
happened (I know, not very original.) When an Elite team of Army
mercenary&#39;s crashes through and takes her into the hive. The team -One,
Rain, Kaplan, J.D- are very one-dimensional, with no past or feelings,
they just burst in, kill, and leave. So trying to destroy the red queen
(BTW, a cop enters somewhere here)the team enter. I think i fell asleep
for the next half an hour or so, nothing happened apart from some back
story about Alices husband and the cops sister. Until your rudely
awoken by...wait for it...TECHNO music, very loud techno music and a
lot of shooting. By this time, they&#39;ve killed some lesser characters
and they escape (the lack of likeness to the game at this point is
really pissing me off.) They&#39;re locked in a room, la la la, the escape,
one of the team is separated (i really don&#39;t care by this point) when
they&#39;re&#39;e locked in a room, and, guess what.. ALICE&#39;S HUSBAND IS THE
BAD GUY!!! So he leaves them to die, he dies, they escape and are on
the train (Resident Evil Zero anyone)and are attacked by the giant, red
obviously CGI monster, but of course they win (this is the one part of
the movie i actually paid attention too, RAIN DIED, she was the only
decent-coughHOTcough- character in the lot.) Anyway, Alice and the
cop-who-has-nothing-to-do-with-any-of-the-plot are alive. Casting
loving looks at each other and so forth, but, wait, he&#39;s INFECTED, and
gets taken away by Umbrella scientist well she looks on,
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Then she wakes up, and the whole cities infected,
leaving Alice in next-to-nothing with a shotgun.<br /><br />Now, i have nothing against the actors in this, all of them play the
parts as well as can be expected, but they struggle to add depth to the
already paper thin parts. Its the director, he obviously is not a fan
of the game and has the brain of a thirteen year old on a sugar high.
&quot;Lets have BIG guns&quot; he says &quot;and lots of dying and a not naked lead.&quot;
Shut up moron! and stop making movies before you ruin another
franchise!!!<br /><br />3/10
