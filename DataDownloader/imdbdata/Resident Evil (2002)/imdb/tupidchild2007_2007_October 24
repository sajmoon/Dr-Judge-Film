It seems to me that I&#39;ve heard many articles stating the Resident Evil
movies are &quot;terrible&quot; or &quot;a waste of my life&quot;. There reasons? They do
not conform with the game. You cannot say that these were terrible
movies just because it didn&#39;t directly relate to the game. Would you
want to watch a movie that you knew what happened behind every door? It
takes the fun out of it. Paul Anderson gave this game-made-movie a
fresh approach. Capcom, that creators of the Resident Evil franchise
did the same thing when they made multiple spin-offs: Survivor,
Survivor 2, Outbreak, Outbreak File #2, Gadien, and Dead Aim. None of
these titles have a direct connection with the game; unless you
consider the Outbreak series being located in Raccoon City. Resident
Evil 4, the most recent released game, has a story line separate from
the normal T-Virus/Umbrella story. They do in fact mention Umbrella and
have characters from the other games just as the movie does. These
movies were made to intrigue the fans of this franchise as well as
introduce it to others not familiar with it. In my opinion, these
movies are a great installment to Resident Evil and I&#39;m glad I spent
time and money to watch them.
