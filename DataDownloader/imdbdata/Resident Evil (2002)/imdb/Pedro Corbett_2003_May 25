Movies based on video games do tend to be disappointing, to say the
least,
so I was very pleasantly surprised that &quot;Resident Evil&quot; is so good. I
wasn't
expecting much from the film, but then it got my attention from the very
first minutes and just kept the adrenaline level high all through the
story.
Nice special effects, good acting and atmospheric music all add to the
tension from start to end. The locations do look more like those in the
game
&quot;Half-Life&quot; than &quot;Resident Evil&quot; the game, but that will just make things
more interesting for &quot;Half-Life&quot; players too.
