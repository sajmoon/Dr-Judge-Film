I just came back from seeing R.E. today and going in I wasn't expecting it
to be as good as it was. IT had me on the edge of my seat most of the movie
and had many parts that mad me jump half-way out of my seat too. The only
reason I can't give it a perfect ten is because they didn't give much
background information on any of the characters and no tyrant. Otherwise I
would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the R.E. series. One thing
though is that it doesn't follow the game so dont go in expecting it to. I
can't wait until the next one comes out if they make another one. I know i
will be there opening day to see it!
