love the resident evil games and I love the zombie films of Romero. I
was really looking forward to a Resident Evil movie rumours had
circulated for years about Romero directing and people like Robert
Partric playing the key characters. Clearly Andersion wasn&#39;t interested
in great things like that instead he thought he&#39;d throw
&quot;Aliens&quot;,&quot;2001&quot;,&quot;George A. Romero&#39;s Trilogy&quot; and a bit of &quot;The Matrix&quot;
in a blender and see what comes out. I can&#39;t believe how bad this movie
is first their is not one character from the original game in it
instead a group of commandos with ridiculous names like One and Rain.
2nd the monsters, where are they? all their is are zombies(Key to the
game of coarse) and a licker(Not even from Resident Evil it&#39;s from
Resident Evil 2!). No sign of the hunters or the tyrant the two famous
creatures from the first game. The platoon of commandos is such a rip
off of the Marine corps from &quot;aliens&quot; right down to the tough soldier
girl who doesn&#39;t take any crap (Played very annoyingly by Michele
Rodreguize who also played the exact same character in the &quot;fast and
the furious&quot; and &quot;Swat&quot;). There are very few scenes that don&#39;t rip-off
another film &quot;the Matrix&quot; rip-offs are probably the worst, watching
&quot;Alice&quot; jump 6 feet in the air and karate kick a zombie dog in slow
motion is absolutely ridiculous. What really rubs salt in the wounds is
that George A. Romero(Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Day
of the Dead) wrote a script for this and was going to direct. I&#39;ve read
his script it&#39;s so much better than this trash.
