Being raised on Resident Evil the video game back in 1997 and playing all
three games in the actual series, not the Gamecube or Dreamcast crap, I
can
full heartedly say this movie is an insult to the game. You have to first
realize the game Resident Evil was probably one of the most popular games
ever, and it still is. The game even started its own genre called
&quot;survival
horror&quot;, nothing made to date except Silent Hill is as good as the
original,
I just had to bring this out in order for you to understand my
review.<br /><br />Why was this movie anticipated so much? Because people thought it would be
based on their favorite video game, they were terribly wrong. Resident
Evil
is horribly cast, the acting is from a 'B' movie, none of the characters
are
interesting and none show any emotion or feelings. The script from the
game
was horribly twisted in that most of the material was new. The story is
unsatisfying, it starts off bad and ends at the same place, it really
doesn't go anywhere. The story begins in the famous mansion, which is only
used for about five minutes where the girl wakes up. A special forces team
crashes through the windows and takes her, and they go to the underground
computer lab to retrive the virus. All the scientists have been turned
into
zombies, then about two or three of the SF team members escape. A horror
movie is supose to scare you or give you a little jump or suprise here and
then, Resident Evil does nothing.<br /><br />The biggest shock factor in the movie is that it resembles the game in
almost no way, after being excited for about five or so years (that's a
long
time) I had huge expectations and was let down. This movie deserves a 1/10
and should have been burned after it was taken off the reel. This isn't
missable, this is despicable.
