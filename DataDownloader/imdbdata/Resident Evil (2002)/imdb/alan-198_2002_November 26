I'm not going to waste your time, or try to be funny, this film is truly
awful, I like action,I like zombies, I like gore, I like naked ladies, I
hate this film.
  Should I list its offences, no, you all deep down know its shortcomings
(even the ones who who think they like it).
  This, ahem !, director MR Anderson has to stop, stop writing , stop
directing, just stop, because he cannot do any of those things, you see,
B&amp;Q's wharehouse awaits good sir, sorry I said I was'nt going to try and be
funny, and this is not funny, if sources are to be believed,(yes, dinner
time spent on &quot;aint it cool&quot;), MR Anderson is to turn his considerable lack
of talent to &quot;ALIENS VS PREDATOR&quot;, and here we reach the rub good
friends.
  What made &quot;ALIEN&quot; , &quot;ALIENS&quot; and &quot;PREDATOR&quot;, good films ?, would it be
fair to say, very good directors, all roughly at the beginning of their
careers as well known directors, I think so, directors who know how to build
tension, character, emotion, and manipulate special effects to accentuate
those elements,  of course, but we know somebody who cannot do those things,
dont we ?
   I said I was'nt going to try and be a smart arse, and I did a bit, and
I'm sorry, I'm also sorry that it appears a film ,which in the hands of a
new, talented director, just breaking through, that did have the possibilty
of rising above a gimmicky concept  , and could have turned in something
really good, but is now doomed to live out its miserable existence, in
hacksville , is heading our way, what a shame !
