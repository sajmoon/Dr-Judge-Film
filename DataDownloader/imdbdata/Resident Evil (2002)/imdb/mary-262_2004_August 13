What I mean by &quot;yuck&quot; in the subject line is the yuck of the film, not<br /><br />the useless slugs/zombies.  Zombies...what makes them so<br /><br />special?  This movie played out like a video game, but a really bad<br /><br />video game that you immediately regret buying or renting or seeing<br /><br />on the big screen.  We bought this DVD in a package deal with<br /><br />Hellboy.  Hellboy was good, but this one is such a stinker, I<br /><br />wouldn't give this to anybody as a &quot;gift.&quot;  My husband refused to<br /><br />see it, as he just thinks the whole premise is stupid.  I do too, but<br /><br />was curious.  And I'm so sorry for that.  Don't waste your time.   I<br /><br />thought the whole writing was terrible, and the acting!!!  Goodness! <br /><br />These people just didn't get it.  And the director?  Somebody just<br /><br />glue him to a chair and force him to watch this dang thing<br /><br />repeatedly until he apologizes.  Yuck.
