You have to be a real snob to not like this movie.  That about summons it
up.  If you enjoy action/horror movies this will be perfect for you.  If you
sti at home watching oprah, don't bother.<br /><br />The story is soemthing like some virus thing blows up or something and what
not and a bunhc of people are sent in to do some stuff in the hive thing
blah blah blah.  Nothing really matrix like here.<br /><br />However, the flow of the action sequences are great.  There seems to be
always something waiting to come out of somewhere and it keeps you on your
toes the whole time.  <br /><br />This movie incorporates brilliant cinematics, excellent sound and dialogue
into a neat package.  I wouldn't go see it again because it's eye candy at
its best and if you watch it once you'll know where all the stuff happens
and you won't be surprised the second time but I would definitly check out
the sequel.<br /><br />7/10 overall 10/10 entertainment/instant gratification
