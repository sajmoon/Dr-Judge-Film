It just wasn't that good. It has slight similarities to the video game
series but not enough to call it a truly faithful adaptation. Milla
Jovovich
gets a plus rating here, as well as Michelle Rodriguez, even though she
plays the same role here as she did in &quot;Fast and the Furious&quot;. You know,
the
tough, take-no-nonsense chick. Blah. I don't know, I think my beef with
the
flick is that it just could've been so much more in the right hands. I'm
not
a big Paul Anderson fan but I don't bash him either. He shows promise when
he wants (i.e. Event Horizon, though the film itself is just as lackluster
as Resident Evil) and I guess there was the possibility that he could've
made this into a respectful fright fest. I think what happened is that his
style got in the way, turning what should have been a gothic, creepy
zombie
flick into a metallic, overstylized piece of celluloid. I liked some of
what
he offered but it didn't outweigh what I had problems with. The laser beam
sequence was actually pretty good. I feel that if this had been given to
George Romero (as it should've been) to do, it would've been what it was
supposed to. I don't know what happened there except for some problem with
creative differences between him and the producers or something. Oh, well.
I
can't help but feel disappointed about the movie, having played through
several of the Resident Evil videogames. It's watchable if you're looking
for a no-brainer action flick with some cute chicks and interesting action
sequences. What you see is what you get! RATING: ** out of *****.
