This one's been in development for quite some time and I was disappointed
when George Romero left the project.First off,the trailer for this movie
made me sweat,because it wasn't very good.Thankfully the movie rocked.By
far
the best game-inspired flick to date and a heck of a good ride.All the way
across the board:good acting,good f/x,awesome soundtrack and score(Marilyn
Manson-who'd a thought),excellent production design and top-notch
direction.All-in-all a very satisfying dark run through the bowls of the
Unbrella corporation....Watch out for the Red Queen and bring on RE#2.Come
Get Some(sorry Duke).ENJOY!
