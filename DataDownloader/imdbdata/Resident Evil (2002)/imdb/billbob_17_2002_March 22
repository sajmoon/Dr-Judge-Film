The plot wasn't any good, but the action scenes did make up for the bad
acting. If the producers read this - this movie better come out on DTS-ES!
This is a movie you would buy to play on a top of the line surround sound
at
your house.  Action (10/10) Plot (7/10) Acting (7/10) Overall (8.5/10) Its
not great but it is worth the $6.00.  Fairly true to the
games.
