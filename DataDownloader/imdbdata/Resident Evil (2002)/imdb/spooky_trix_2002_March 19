Resident Evil.  What does this movie contribute to the horror
genre?<br /><br />Although it is the first main stream big budget american zombie movie in a
decade or so, this movie falls short of being a classic horror for several
reasons:<br /><br />1.  Soundtrack.  Why is it that so many horror movies are little more than
a
vehicle to sell a soundtrack?  Mostly, the soundtrack worked the pumping
dark techno added to the futuristic suspense, but everytime there was a
song
with lyrics, it cheapens the film.<br /><br />2.  CGI.  Not having ever played RE, I don't really see what the mutants
really contribute to the movie.  I'm sure the sequel will make this make
more sense.  Personally the zombies were much more scary than the tongue
monster.  When is hollywood going to learn that audiences are not scared by
CGI monsters, we say, wow that's cool, and then get scared by something as
cheap as someone grabbing another person in a tense situation.  But
anyways.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />The zombies were fantastic.  Some people think that they were cheap
looking.
Have you ever seen one of the best horror movies ever?  Dawn of the Dead?
The zombies in that are little more than people with grey pancake makeup
on.
In RE the zombies have creative makeup, and most have some icky wounds.  I
loved the scene where they opened the door and all the zombies came rushing
out (ripped off of dawn of the dead, but its about time someone ripped off
a
good movie for once instead of scream), it was one of the best scares,
eventhough anyone who's seen Dawn knows whats coming.<br /><br />Milla was also great.  She kicked major butt!  And she did it wearing the
least amount of clothing possible.  If that's what women will be wearing in
the future, build me a time machine.  The supporting actors, while
underdeveloped, added to the story (except for Rain, who was annoying, and
i
couldn't wait for her demise).<br /><br />The flashbacks Milla had were also wonderful.  Very very eerie, especially
the lab scene and the graveyard.  By the way, the german chick playing
Lisa,
we American audiences need more of her.  She would've made a great zombie.<br /><br />The other really great thing:  The red queen.  The film makers have
stumbled
upon the best horror theory:  little girls with english accents are beyond
creepy.  If you don't believe me, watch the others, or the
innocents.<br /><br />With the exception of minor flaws, this was a good movie, not a classic,
but
for a video game inspired plot starring a supermodel, this movie went way
above my expectations.<br /><br />Please be warned though, seeing Milla nude at the end of the movie is not
sexy at all.  Don't expect to pop some wood, amazingly the filmmaker has
managed to make us repulsed by her nudity, you'll understand once you've
seen it.<br /><br />7.5 out of 10 for a horror
9 out of 10 for a video game inspired movie (even that can't make me forget
the CGI monster)
