I didn't know much about Resident Evil except that it was based on a
Computer shoot-em-up and made into a zombie-splatter-flick. So when the
title came up on the screen at the Sneak Preview, I was prepared for a bit
of action filled onscreen-slaughter in which the brain can be safely
turned
off. The film eventually exceeded my expectations and managed to impress
me
on many a level and proved to be at the top of it's genre ? and immensely
entertaining to watch.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong ? &quot;Resident Evil&quot; still wants to be a splatter
movie
and provides everything that is expected: The group of &quot;good guys&quot; getting
smaller and smaller, torn apart Zombies and other nasty creatures, blood
and
gore, shock effects that will have a good part of the audience jumping
(and
some screaming) in their seats, the girl (in this case the main
heroine)not
dressed in much, bullets flying left, right and centre.<br /><br />But this film has much more to offer than that:<br /><br />The directing by Paul Anderson is quite impressive. The choreography of
the
plenty of action scenes not only lets you keep a sense of what's going on
(as opposed to the
&quot;let's-just-use-a-shaking-hand-held-camera-and-give-the-audience-a-headache&quot;
kind of film) but is also nice to watch. (Sometimes also when you don't
see
the critical second on-screen. But don't worry, you will still see
plenty!)
Sets and effects create  the creepy and claustrophobic atmosphere, with
the
undead dogs being my favourite bad creatures ? they do the best job in
looking disgusting yet dangerous.<br /><br />The Story, by Anderson too, is also a major point that raises this flick
above the average standard of the genre. Sure, the whole design of the
&quot;hive&quot;, the super-computer, the virus etc. lack any real-life logic, but
this is hardly what you came looking for in a film about zombie-bashing in
the first place. So once you're in the right frame of mind to accept that,
the story in itself is quite complex for it's genre. There are a couple of
sub-plots, flashback scenes, deadlines and plot twists, so to successfully
add suspense and surprise moments to all the shock and fright scenes. The
film avoids using all typical clich&eacute;-scenes, never getting totally
predictable and boring. A couple characters also have there individual
background and escape the trap of becoming two-dimensional monster food.
You
even begin to care about them, especially the Soldier played by Michelle
Rodriguez.
The actors are convincing and do a very decent job. Note that even for
smaller roles, &quot;Resident Evil&quot; casted &quot;real&quot; actors instead of &quot;zombie
food
extras&quot;. (i.e. Dr. Lisa is played by Heike Makatsch, a quite well known
actress in the German-speaking regions).<br /><br />The pace of the film is a very fast one, which is not a bad thing
normally,
as it doesn't get boring, but ? and here we go with the first point I
criticize ? now and then, you get the feeling that longer parts have been
cut out and are now missing. The story then jumps ahead  and leaves the
audience with a &quot;there-at-this-point-all-of-sudden?-that-was-fast!&quot;
feeling.
I wonder if there'll be a directors cut on DVD.
The music in the first part of the film is a bit too loud and disturbing.
Nothing is really going on yet, but we already have the sound that would
be
worthy for a showdown scene. It gets better after a while (maybe because
the
action starts fitting the music).
With all the positive points though, the later ones can easily be
overlooked.<br /><br />All in all, if you like the Zombie-slaying kind of horror film, go see
&quot;Resident Evil&quot; ? it's a prime quality example of this genre and you won't
be disappointed.<br /><br />P.S. I'd really like to see the original crew come back for a
sequel!
