I&acute;ve played and finished almost all re games, and although the film is
different from the game, i consider it one greatest adaptations from a
videogame ever.the story and the characters although they are not present
in
any of re games, it resembles alot the re style. Virus Mutations, Zombies
walking around and showing at the end of the corners, a Badass monster
boss,
dark lighting, a hot babe running around and shooting everything. This is
enough for me to say that the film is faithfull to the movie. Now talking
about the movie itself: It doesn&acute;t make your jump of your chair, instead
it
glues you to it. The plot is great considering this is a horror movie,
it&acute;s
a much better story than those average teen horror craps like Soul
Survivors
(blahhh, hate that). The amnesia part was well worked, giving the film a
little twist in it&acute;s middle. I give it a 4 out of 5 (a small 4), and would
to like to add that if you love films like Evil Dead, Braindead or the
Thing
you will surely love Resident Evil.
