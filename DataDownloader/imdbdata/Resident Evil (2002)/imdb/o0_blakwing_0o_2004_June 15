In my opinion this was a great movie. No, not the best but great still.
the only problem I have with this movie was the CG of the &quot;big monster&quot;
looked pretty damn cheesy. This is the only case where I have seen a
video game made into a movie come out in a good way. Other than the
lame monster the FX were good enough to keep me happy. Some people say
things like &quot;the red queen didn't show them the secret passage out&quot;...
well wasn't she trying to keep them from escaping in the first place?
Or.. &quot;there were a lot of clich&eacute; lines used&quot;... well give me a line
that's never been used in any movie ever before, please.<br /><br />Over all I think this movie was great, maybe not a damn academy award
winner but good enough to buy and watch more than a few times
