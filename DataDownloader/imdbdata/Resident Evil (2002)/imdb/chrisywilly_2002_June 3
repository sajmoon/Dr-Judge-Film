Well, from what i can tell this is a love hate movie: you either love it or
hate it!! This film has to be the greatest movie of a game yet - although
this alone is enough to put many people off watching it. Give the film your
attention and let yourself be absorbed into it. I loved every minute of it.
There are some cheesy 1 liners and the usual obvious CGI effects but it
kept
me and my friends glued to the TV for a few hours. I particulaly liked the
stylised sequences in the film such as the dog fight. All in all a highly
enjoyable movie but i think you will have to watch and make your own
decision.
