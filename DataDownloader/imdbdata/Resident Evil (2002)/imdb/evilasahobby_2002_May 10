<br /><br />Resident Evil isn't a bad film, just nothing exceptional. As a zombie film,
it hits its marks, but doesn't do anything to distinguish itself from the
pack. Day of the Dead is a much better film if you want to see the walking
dead in action.<br /><br />As a video game adaption, it does what any good adaption does: keep only the
bare bones of the material and build new flesh over them. The original story
contained in the game has thrown out. Unlike some game adaptions (Double
Dragon, for instance) it works in this case, but mainly because the original
story was a generic zombie / mad science plot. The Resident Evil movie has
just taken one version of zombies / mad science and replaced it with
another. In fact, the links to the game are so tenuous (apart from the theme
and some stylistic factors) you wonder if the license was bought to attract
a greater audience.<br /><br />The big problem with the film is that the narrative gets weaker as the film
progresses. Starting with the stealing of the T-virus (the zombie making
agent) and the smashing of a T-virus tube in the lab (because the thief was
evil, as far as I can tell), the computer security system known as the Red
Queen locks down the facility and kills all the employees. It's a great
start, and the use of security cameras as a view point for the audience is a
great effect because you get to see the Red Queen's abilities and
depersonalised status. From here on it's downhill in regards to the
narrative - some flashbacks, a weak backstory surrounding attempted
corporate espionage and characters making stupid / evil decisions against
all common sense. You got bitten by a zombie for which there is no cure?
Hey, hang around us, please! A top secret bio-warfare facility went into
lockdown? First thing we should do is open it up!<br /><br />There are some great moments, such as the appearance of the skinless dogs.
But there are so many holes in the story the movie suffers. That said, the
ending does leave a huge gaping hole for a sequel, and if one is made I'll
go and see and pick it apart too!<br /><br />
