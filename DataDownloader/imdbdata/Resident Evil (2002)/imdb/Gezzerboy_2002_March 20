Not being a fan of computer game films i thought this would be your typical
rubbish. How wrong can you be. From start to finish except for a couple of
weird bits this film rocks. <br /><br />Great special effects and a not bad story line keep you glued to the screen
all the way through. I recommend this to everyone. <br /><br />Check out the bit in the computer room with the laser beams.......
