&quot;Resident Evil&quot; is true to both the spirit of zombie movies and to the
console game it was based on.  If either of these criteria drew you to the
film, chances are you were not expecting a profound exploration of the
human
condition anyway.  The film delivers precisely what it promises.  This
movie
is a bloody exposition of special effects and super-models with fire axes.
If neither appeals to you, stay at home and read Dickens.<br /><br />Beyond this, &quot;Resident Evil&quot; relies heavily on tried-and-true formulae for
the horror and action genres.  Things jump out.  There are loud noises.
Blood gushes.  We have close ups.  We have slow-motion.  The plot twists
aren't exactly the end of &quot;Usual Suspects.&quot;<br /><br />If any of these things bother you, then the volume is too low and it isn't
dark enough in the theatre.  Subjecting &quot;Resident Evil&quot; to a cynical
criticism of its stock elements is like drinking your beer warm and then
complaining because it tastes bad.  Accept that this is not Hamlet, and
enjoy &quot;Resident Evil&quot; for its loud and expensive applications of
horror/action traditions.  It's sleek for a zombie movie and very good for
a
movie made from a video game.  8/10.
