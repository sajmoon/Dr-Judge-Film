This movie really rocks, I mean this is the first time i find a video game
movie which is totally cool...The opening is fab and the flesh eating
zombies are so real and sick looking that'll keep you glued to your chair
for the rest of the movie,a brilliant movie with lots of great zombies
makeup probably the coolest zombies i have ever seen...The zombie dogs
scene
is really scary, and the stars especially Milla J,Michelle R,and Eric M
did
a great job...This is the best horror movie of 2002,the music's even much
better i mean the sound track rocks SLIP KNOT were fab!!!SO DONT MISS THIS
FLICK:)I would definitely recommend it for all RE and horror lovers and
for
those who enjoy thrillers and a cool ride to umbrella corp. A REALLY SCARY
ROLLER COASTER
