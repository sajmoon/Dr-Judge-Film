2002_March 15 

Let me preface by saying that I'm a huge fan of the video games and a
lover
of horror movies.  And if I weren't so enamored of Milla Jovovich, I'd
have
walked out of the theatre.  I was bored out of my mind.  The
inappropriately
pounding soundtrack didn't help, and the camera was like a squeamish
girlfriend as it kept trying to turn away from the gore (or lack thereof).
The pacing was so bad it felt like I was reading a book with missing
pages.<br /><br />I'm really disappointed with this one.
