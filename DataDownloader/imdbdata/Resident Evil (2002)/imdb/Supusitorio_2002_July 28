Its amazing how today s critics don t know nothing about movies.Since i
dont
listen to the critics,i went to watch RE and wasnt dissapointed.People
often
proclaim that there isnt enough gore in the movie,but id say it had gore
enough,and it had story,one thing dead alive didnt had.Zombie films are
often just gore,zombies,gore etc.This one scared,had a decent cast,a decent
story,and besides the usual zombies,they had some zombie dogs,an instable
mutant and a homicidal supercomputer called Red Queen.The movie takes place
on a facility called THE HIVE wich is controlled by umbrella corp.and
everything turns into chaos,when someone releases the virus,and the
computer
is forced to kill the umbrella employees,who later turn to zombies.That
opening scene really scared me,but id say the movie is more of an adventure
than a horror movie,even tough i like it,it also manages to explain the
happenings of the game series.But RE isnt a perfect movie,the mutant was
completely unbelivable,Alice managed to kill some zombies by kicking
them,and the special effects look cartoonish,especially the mutant,he gets
more realistic after evolving but it is still an umbelievable creation.This
altough,is surely Anderson s best movie,and best game adaptation to screen
so far.As a zombie movie,id say its at least better than dead alive,and
some
others but theyll ruin it by making the sequel,and i fear to say RE will be
forgotten,but at least not by me.
