what resident evil lacks very much was more action. the reason why i
say this is because in every scene it told somethings that we already
know.i also felt that the movie should have been longer because of the
missing details that they don&#39;t feel us in with. Resident evil is a
good action flick but it does not have the horror or(edge) that a real
horror movie has. take dawn of the dead for instance it brings a mostly
good story line and creates suspense and horror.RE picks up at the
mansion in raccoon city where everything is a blur to her and her
husband.Alice is then trapped underground with a few other soldiers.
but i will not tell the whole movie that would ruin it for other RE
fans. the first time i saw this was on com cast 5 years ago.I was very
satisfied with it to the end. RE still have could have better for all
the gamer fans.for Imb fans you should enjoy it but don&#39;t expect it to
be cream of the crop material.i rate it a 7.5\10.
