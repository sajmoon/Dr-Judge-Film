I have been playing the game since the first one came out and it is
probably
my favorite game ever. So I knew that when I saw &quot;Alice?&quot; kick the dog in
the preview, I knew the movie wasn't going to be like the game. In the game
you walk through a mansion or warehouse or some other creepy scenery and
shoot the zombies. You can not kick in the game! And who is Alice and Rain?
Why couldn't they use Claire or Jill, um, like in the game. The movie
itself
was a 5 at best. I guess I'm just p***ed there wasn't any green herbs or
puzzles to solve or anything really that scary. But I wouldn't be so mad if
the movie wasn't called Resident Evil!!
