I love this film. Paul Anderson is a great director. Bold statement I
know. A lot of you will disagree with me and I will tell you that you
are probably just one of those guys who have seriously jumped on the
bandwagon. Because that&#39;s basically all that it&#39;s amounted to. Paul
Anderson has had the opportunity to direct films that have a extremely
high expectancy level to them. And this alone is probably the reason he
is lambasted so. Because no one can live up to a lot of fan boys
expectations.<br /><br />I myself am a fan boy, but I&#39;m an open minded and not such a nit-picky
one.<br /><br />Anderson really knows how to construct a movie and tell a story quite
well. The scares in this flick are anything but clich&eacute;. He knows how to
scare us by providing an extremely high level of suspense.<br /><br />The gore is low, and that is my main problem with the film. It&#39;s based
on a video game that has buckets of it. There is some though. It isn&#39;t
completely bloodless. But at least there is plenty of suspense and
terrific action sequences. In the end that&#39;s what really matters.<br /><br />Everything else though works completely. We are introduced to
characters we genuinely care about and are sad to see it when they
ultimately meet their untimely demise.<br /><br />The special effects are terrific and the music by Marco Beltrami and
Marilyn Manson is pulsating, creepy, and very unsettling.<br /><br />It&#39;s a superior horror film that I highly recommend.
