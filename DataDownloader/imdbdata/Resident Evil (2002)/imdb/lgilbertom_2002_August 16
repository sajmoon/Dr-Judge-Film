My comments there isn't exactly SPOILLERS but you was advised.<br /><br />The basic plot-line is a great corporation has been developed a new virus
and an &quot;accident&quot; occurs and the virus is free. The computer to avoid the
virus spread, kill everyone in the base and there are only two survivors.
A
elite team is send to the installation and verify &quot;what a hell is going
on&quot;
and switch off the computer (because the computer kill everyone in the
base
of course). Well, the problems started because the computer dislike of the
idea to be switch off, but this is only the beginning. The tone of the
movie
is Gothic and a little creepy and has a touch of &quot;matrix&quot;. I explain,
there
is a sequence where the character of the Milla Jovovich kill some &quot;DOGS&quot;
and
a normal person NEVER does this things.<br /><br />These comments are enough to get a good idea of the movie, the actors
works
well, specially Milla, the special effects are very good. The some actions
scenes are fast and brutal others has a creepy tone but are well worked.
Ok,
the script could be a little more elaborate but is good enough for this
kind
of movie. But there is an important thing, the end of movie is consistent
with the basic background of the movie.<br /><br />In my opinion if you see this movie you will have a good time
:).
