I wasn't going to review this movie, but I just get so MAD when people go on
and on about how &quot;Resident Evil: The Movie&quot; wasn't an exact representation
of &quot;Resident Evil: The Game Series&quot;.  What you people don't get is that
we're talking about two totally different mediums of artistic expression.
How can you possibly make a movie and expect to market it to the world if it
only makes sense to a certain group of gamers?  And why bother making a
movie in the first place since there's already an identical game people can
play?<br /><br /> Movies are not games.  They tell stories in a different way, and have much
less time to do it in than a game does.  This means things have to be
changed, shuffled around, and taken right out.  Characters have to be
condensed, backgrounds brief, let's get right to the action.  You see what
I'm saying?<br /><br /> Resident Evil was a fun movie.  It had a comprehensible plot that didn't
get bogged down technically with advanced science mumbo jumbo.  This movie
basically gives you the skeleton of a much bigger story, and it's up to you
to put the missing pieces together.  I never really played the games at all,
and I understood everything that was going on.<br /><br /> Go see Resident Evil if you enjoy a fast paced movie that is never corny or
badly written.  Milla Jovovich was great, and I hope she gets more tough
girl roles in the future.  All of the actors were well casted and there were
actually a couple of surprises in the script along the way too.<br /><br /> But if you're still reading reviews for this movie asking yourself, &quot;I love
zombie movies, but is Resident Evil still worth my time and money?&quot;   IT'S A
MOVIE ABOUT ZOMBIES!!  That should be enough to get any fan of the genre out
to see this movie.  When was the last zombie movie to hit theaters?  I mean
a real zombie movie.  It's been a while right?  Go see Resident Evil.
