My English is not so good but i will try to say what I think about this
movie. The movie is great, the actors... EVERYTHING I like the game to.
When you are watching the movie you feel so great, I watched it 6 times
and i could watched it again. I am looking forward to a new version of
the resident evil. I would like to encourage the actors, directors,
writers everybody who had anything to do with this film to keep up the
good work. I think the Resident Evil After life is in pre-production.
Oh... And if Milla will ever read this comment. Your great, love you!
You look good, act good, a fantastic woman. I can also speak Serbian,
so if you will ever read this mail I would like to talk with you, just
to ask how did you manage to succeed in your life. You don't find a lot
of people succeeding from Serbia or Montenegro. But why Jovovich? You
are Jovovi&amp;#263;, I am 100% Yeah... Probably because the way of life,
you live in America probably or England. Love you, bye
