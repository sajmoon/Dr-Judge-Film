I like Milla, I like the Zombiedogs, they don't like her. Milla turns into
Carrie-Anne Moss, runs around a wall, and kicks a dog in the head. If you
saw this in the trailer, then you have already seen the highlight of this
flick. Come to think of it, maybe Carrie-Anne should give some thought to
scrapping the latex in favor of a slinky designer cocktail dress for
Matrix
4, 5, and 6.<br /><br />Timeout for a public service request. HELLO....ASPCA, where are you? This
movie is an affront to all genetically altered killer zombie dobermans and
their owners everywhere.<br /><br />I can't imagine this thing generating enough attention to justify a
sequel.
One of the worst I've ever seen. But, if you just can't get enough of
zombie
movies, and you thought Blade II was cool, and you asked your mommie for
an
X-Box for Christmas, then you'll probably like this thing. 1 Moooltiepass,
to get me as far away as possible.
