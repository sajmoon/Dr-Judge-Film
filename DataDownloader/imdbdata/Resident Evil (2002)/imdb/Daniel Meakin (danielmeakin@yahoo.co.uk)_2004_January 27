Ok, Video games to films?
Not very good admitted, Super Mario Bros attests to that.
I am trying not to be biased as i am a massive fan of the video
games.
Unfortunately, this film was a very very good chance to make a top notch
horror flick.
It's a double edged sword however, if they rewrite(As they pretty much
did)
the storyline, it leaves it dissimilar to the VG's that me and quite a few
others love!
and if they dont rewrite it, it would obviously turn out to be
predictable.
Besides the disappointment of RE for that matter, it is a great watch,
with
some special effects to make the game &quot;come to life&quot; (the
licker)
and the film is ultimately cast above such terrible efforts as mario bros
and StreetFighter.
Milla Jovovich is worthy of a lead role, and looks damn fine as
well!
A hashed &quot;alien-style&quot; plot of the underground laboratory security system
&quot;turning against them&quot; was kinda shocking but given the aforementioned VG
to
film efforts, it holds it head up high, though without unfortunately being
able to scare the life outta me!<br /><br />any comments or questions on my comment will be answered if you want to
email me.
Please put RE in the subject matter if you do so !<br /><br />
