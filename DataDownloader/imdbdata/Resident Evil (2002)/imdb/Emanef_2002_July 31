As a fan of the Resi Evil games, I was really looking forward to the
movie,
and I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />I read a real mixed bag of reviews before I saw the movie, and can't
really
understand how anyone can criticise a movie that ultimately stays faithful
to its videogame origin, but without the cheesiness that most other
videogame/movie crossover end up being.  If you're looking for something
with intelligence and real substance, you shouldn't be watching a zombie
movie.....<br /><br />The story, obviously, is very true to the videogames, but there are also
many subtle camera shots and angles that bring back memories of playing
the
games, such as one moment when the lovely Milla shoots an ex-security
guard.
He falls back to the ground, slumped against the wall.  As she notices
the
gun in his pouch, the camera angle changes to above both Milla and the
inanimate zombie looking down from above, and you just know that as soon
as
she touches the gun, he'll grab her! (He doesn't, incidently.....!) It
also
has the claustrophobic feel of a classic zombie movie, with the constantly
increasing flow of relentless walking dead refusing to stop trying to
munch
their way through the cast.<br /><br />The soundtrack is pretty pumping and does carry the movie, though, to be
honest, I think it would have been more atmospheric with no music, just
the
audio and effects, like the Romero movies of old. Movie companies seem to
think they're neccessary for some reason.  Not neccessarily a criticism,
just a personal preference. Mind you, these zombies are rather more
aggressive looking that Romero's....!<br /><br />All in all, a very entertaining movie, doing exactly what it says on the
tin.  Not really sure what else people expected....!<br /><br />And it's left it very nicely open for Mr Nemesis to take main
stage.....!
