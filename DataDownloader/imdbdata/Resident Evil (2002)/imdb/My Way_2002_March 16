Damn I just watched the movie in a staff screening of empire theatres. and
it was damn good! now, i really don't like movies like that, where there's
so much blood and guts and people eating each other, but it was really
well
done.<br /><br />The style, cinematography and acting in the movie are just right for the
gendre and mood of the film. some may say they suck at acting but i liked
the cold, some may say bad acting of the characters. it suits the movie
better.<br /><br />This movie is not about making moody masterpiece, more of just running
around in panic and trying to survive. and scaring us with freaky zombies
who wants to bite you.<br /><br />the movie is 2 hours and 50 minutes but i never noticed the time, meaning
it
was really fast paced and kept you with the movie throughout the whole
time.<br /><br />I would NOT go see it again. because i am not in favor of the contents -
such as people being eaten, being cut up to pieces etc etc. but that's
just
me. that's not my thing. but it is recommended that the people go see it
as
it's a FUN movie to watch. I was driving home after the movie and god i
felt
like i was in the movie. I felt quite paranoid. i felt like a zombies
gonna
jump into my car window andtry to break in. But no zombie did.
hewwwwww<br /><br />overall, i give the movie two thumbs up for doing what it set out to do
- mindless running around in frantic trying to survive horror movie that
keeps you on the edge of your seats with horrific images and
ideas.<br /><br />I doubt people who made the movie thought about it morally, but i really
thinkt hat what happened in the movie should be seriously considered.
Zombies and Genetics technology. believe it or not, it may all be possible
for shit like that to happen someday. all of the great scientific advances
we have origially started from ideas and fantasy.<br /><br />ofcourse, nobody (i hope) fantasizes about zombies, but i think the fact
that we are developing sciences without thinking and not takign
responsibilty for our creation is a serious issue. infact, we already have
things in this world that are far more horrific than zombies. - Nuclear
Weapons.<br /><br />anyways. go see the movie!
