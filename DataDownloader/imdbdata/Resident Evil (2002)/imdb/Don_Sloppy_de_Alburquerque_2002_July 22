People who are looking for a &quot;modern&quot; version of the Romero
flicks,
might be pretty disappointed by this.  Guess what?  Modern movies
don't
have the splatter and gore of the 70s and 80s.  This movie's
special
effects are TAME, and I couldn't help feeling a little let
down.<br /><br />The plot is about what I expected.  I have no objections
there.
