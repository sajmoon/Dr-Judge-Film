Excellent remake from an all-time horror classic 'Night of the living
dead'. <br /><br />The movie very deliberately re-creates the horrified and depressing
tensions apparent in its predecessor(the aforementioned film). In spite
of that it's actually more science-fiction and action-oriented than
horror. <br /><br />Don't remember did the director of original classic participate in
making of this or not, but the aspects from tension between good and
dark side of human nature are all there (under the action-style
mainline). Racial conflicts are not so apparent in this, in fact
characters all in all are just there to decorate the story (allthough
the action and plot of the movie actually begins from Milla Jovovich
appearance).<br /><br />There's naturally a lot similarities to other(later) films than NOTLD.
For example the main plot about rescue team resembles Aliens movies
(especially the 2nd, but others too...) Computerized cameras and views
remind me somehow from Terminator films and of course, because movie is
based on a game, there's a bit of tension from game-like storytelling.
Haven't played the game though, cannot say how much there's similarity.<br /><br />One more aspect to mention is the 'music'(or sound scape) in film which
is mostly from 90's ambient and something like techno-metal effects (it
might have inspired from the game actually?). It very cleverly builds
excitement in crucial moments.<br /><br />All in all, this must be one of the best (not many are worth
mentioning) scifi-horror oriented films from 90's/2000. Also, I suppose
it could be one of the few really good(if not only one?) movies based
on PC-game. There's a lot needles violence and blood as in this kind
films usually do, but not too much to spoil the excitement of the
plot...
