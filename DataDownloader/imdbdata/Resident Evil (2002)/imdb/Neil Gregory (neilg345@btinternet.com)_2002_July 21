Its a zombie film not high art so i'm amazed at the bad reviews RE has
gained. Lets see hot women with guns-check, flesh eating zombies-check and
generally s*** gettin blown up, what more do you want from a zombie film?
Also as a fan of the game its great to see how much effort went into the
production design recreating scenes from the games .  Sure the film could
be
better in places but most of what takes place is there to set up the
sequel.
I can't wait to see if the rumoured unrated edition will come out on DVD
so
we can see all the extra gore that was cut from the cinema release.  And
the
ending is right up there with some of all time classic horror
finales.
