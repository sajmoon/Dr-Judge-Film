I've played RE3, but I never got a chance to play the original, so I can't
accurately comment on it. But there is one thing that I am sure of... Due
to
the original game settings, even if there is a sequel to the movie, it's
either a)new characters in the same Raccoon City or b)it would keep away
from the game. (In the 2nd in the series, the main characters are called
Leon and Claire. In RE3 the main character is called Jill.)<br /><br />I want sequel!!! If they're making a sequel for The Whole Nine Yards, they
could definitely make one for Resident Evil!!!
