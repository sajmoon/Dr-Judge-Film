Why do we even fear zombies? I mean think about it, they are usually mangled
corpses that walk about as fast as a 100 year old person. Is it because they
wish to eat our flesh? the fact that they are reanimated corpses? the fact
that they are monsters that just wander around in broad daylight, rather
than hide in the darkness and spring out at you like every other monster
known to man? or is it the fact that when you see one zombie, once you turn
the corner all his zombie friends will be there.<br /><br />Whatever it is, Resident Evil is a movie about, or should I say WITH,
zombies in it. It's THE best film based off a videogame (I know you're
asking &quot;How can this movie top Mortal Kombat Annihilation?&quot; *sarcasm*) but
it is, because it's a slight blend of a few of the games' plotlines, but
they specifically made the movie for the movies rather than be the premise
of the videogame, stuffed with all the monsters, characters and ideas of the
videogame.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich and the rest of the cast are not going to win any Oscars for
their performances in this picture, but at least they arn't stiff and cheesy
like most acting in videogame films. It's nice that Milla can prove that you
can pull of the kick ass babe role in a movie without wearing dominatrix
like outfits, spouting stupid catch phrases, and does not need a large set
of implants to do it. All she needed was a simple red dress, leather boots,
and those sexy-as-hell eyes of hers, and she had me swooning and cheering
her on all the way.<br /><br />The plot of the film is simple. There is a corporation that is underground
from Raccoon City. One of their experiments, the T-virus is set loose in the
compound. The super-computer that surveys the entire lab, quarintines the
place and kills off all inside. Then a team is sent to shut down her
motherboard (I guess this is so they can use the lab again). Of course
shutting the computer down shuts off power, and then all the experiments
escape, and all hell breaks loose. <br /><br />So in short, if you wanna see a creepy film full of zombies, zombie dogs, a
computer with a creepy British child's voice, and some other weird creature,
go see Resident Evil, it'll make all zombie fans happy and give people
another reason to worship Milla.
