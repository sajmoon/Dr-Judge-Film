This movie is bad. Take every horror movie cliche you can think of, ripoff
the story from Aliens, add third rate Matrix like special effects and then
when the violnece kicks in pan away so there is no blood or gore despite
that bieng the main idea of the movie and shake well.
There are a few highlights, the makeup effects on the zombies are great
and
Mill Jovovich is both beautiful and solid as an action hero.<br /><br />If you're a big fan of the game or of Milla it might be worth your time
but
if you're looking for a good horror movie look elsewhere.
