If you would like to know about the movie, I am off to bed, so you will
have
to email me.  I'd be thrilled to speak about it with anybody, though.  All
in all, not based on the characters from the game, not much of it takes
place within the mansion, but it was still outstanding for the type of
move.
Milla Jovovich had an excellent performance on top of all of that, plus it
is left open for a sequel.  I felt that it had a great ending.  Hope to
hear
from you all.  Recommendation:  Pay the money (make sure it's a good
theater; loud speakers, big screen, the works)!
