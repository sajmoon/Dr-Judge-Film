CRAP! This movie is the most awful piece of garbage I have seen since
&quot;Vanilla Sky&quot;! Let's start with the plot. 1 homicidal computer (done in
earlier movies) a lot of Zombies (done BETTER and with humour in MANY other
movies) and a dash of lost memory (please, don't get me started). Hence
noone really knows who the bad guy/girl is or event if there is one - and
quite frankly I didn't care! The characters are so unrealistic and the
acting so sub-...well---sub-everything, I'm afraid that I really couldn't
care less as to who survived and who died a zombie-death we I had seen done
better so many times before... hm. I think I hate Zombies now, and it is
all
due to this film. Damn! Oh, and I almost forgot! They decided to put in a
pile of annoying and unneccesary flash-backs to p*** me off just enough to
rate this movie 1 instead of a 2. So there you have it! You enjoyed this
movie? SHAME ON YOU! Go home and BEG forgiveness from your DVD-player for
making it play this movie!
