Somewhere I've read that this movie was &quot;yet another videogame adaptation
with even less plot than Tomb Raider&quot;... Actually, that statement is
wrong.<br /><br />Yes, it is a videogame adaptation (of a game I never plaid), and it shows.
The &quot;Hive&quot;? Linear plot development on a mission basis (Find the queen -
kill the queen - fight the zombies - try to escape -.....)? Creatures just
oozing that special air of &quot;level end boss&quot;? (The Queen, The fellow right
at
the end, maybe even the dogs).. Yup - it's a videogame
alright.<br /><br />But, surprisingly, it is FUN to watch! The plot may be a bit thin - but
unlike the pile of bulldung that Tomb Raider had for a story, this movie
actually has a lot more charme and skill worked into its storytelling. Of
course, it's still far from a proper thriller/drama, but I'd say it isn't
too inferior to &quot;Aliens&quot; on the level of its storytelling. Definitely
superior to Blade 2 - another movie with similar elements.<br /><br />On a visual level, this movie is pure joy. Vibrant colours, amazing
creature
effects, utterly scary Doberman dogs - yup! These visuals rock! And the
action, too, is brilliant, although a few more kung-fu-esque kicking
sequences would have been needed. The entry hall to the queen's chamber is
definitely an impressive piece of action cinema, perhaps even the best of
the movie, although it's a close call. The soundtrack underlines the
action,
and it fits superbly. If you have seen &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot; it will
sound
similar, and it definitely enriches the movie.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great summer action movie, looking like a mixture of
Night of the Living Dead and Blade 2 - but being better than both at
satisfying my tastes. Fun. Fun. Fun.<br /><br />And the ending is very cool, too.....<br /><br />8/10
