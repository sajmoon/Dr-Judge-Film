It's hard to say that everyone would like this movie. Anyone who likes
Sci-Fi thrillers that at the end make you want to stop crime the 'kick
ass' way, this is a movie for you.<br /><br />A secret corporation called the Umbrella Corporation are manufactured
underground. They constructed a virus known as the T Virus that makes
the dead... undead. Also, they have an anecdote that brings them back
to live. This movie was suppose to be based off of the Hit Game Series,
but many of the welcomed characters were mistaken. None of the original
characters were in the film, nor did the film resemble much of the
game.<br /><br />Even though it wasn't completely based off the game, that doesn't make
it a bad movie. It was still enjoyable, and worth watching (worth
owning if you're into this type of genre).<br /><br />8 out of 10
