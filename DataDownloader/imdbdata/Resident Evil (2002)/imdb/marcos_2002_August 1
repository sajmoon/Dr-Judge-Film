When i went into this movie, i was expecting another super mario brothers
quality game adaptation. Having played the RE series, i was amazed at the
accuracy of the movie. They didnt give it a cartoonish game type feel which
would have been easy to do. They kept it dark and very cold. I loved how
they jumped right into the movie, no long into to lose audience interest,
the movie grabs your from the start and never let's go. There were so many
jump scenes i knew were coming, but they still got me. The score was
amazing, very cold and machine-like with the bass acting as a heartbeat
throughout. The zombie looked and acted great. the ending was a perfect
setup for a sequel. Overall, this is one of the better horror movies. Lots
of suspense, but it doesnt slow down, just a rollercoaster ride of a
action/horror movie
