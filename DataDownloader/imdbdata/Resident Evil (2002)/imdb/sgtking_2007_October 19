The zombie movie seemed to be a thing of the past. Sure they were still
making them throughout the 90s, but we didn&#39;t really hear about them as
much as we did films like Romero&#39;s &#39;Dead&#39; films, the &#39;Return of the
Living Dead&#39; series, and so on. Nothing really new or exciting was
being done with the concept. One place where it was really kept alive
was in the world of video games, including one Resident Evil. Having
only played the game once or twice myself I didn&#39;t know how to feel
about a film adaptation. I mean let&#39;s be honest, few films based on
these games get it right. Sure the Mario Brothers movie is fun in a
so-bad-it&#39;s-good way, but was it really satisfying? I guess that
depends on the viewer. Anyway, thanks to this movie the zombie subgenre
was hot again.<br /><br />Pros: A tense, terrifying opening sequence. Writer/director Anderson
gives us a film that&#39;s a visual feast due to it&#39;s slickness, his use of
blue lights, slow motion, etc. A cool electronic score. Moves at a
brisk pace. All around, the performances are pretty good. Good special,
make-up, and visual effects. At least a couple good scares. Some
awesome set pieces; my personal favorite being the one involving
lasers. Amazing production design.<br /><br />Cons: Fans of zombie movies may bit disappointed that it takes a while
for the walking cadavers to show up and wreak havoc. Aside from some
original touches, this film is fairly derivative of other zombie,
action, and science fiction films.<br /><br />Final thoughts: This modern zombie flick is a whole new dimension. Back
in the day it was either a chemical spill or voodoo curse that raised
the dead. But this is like a Romero zombie movie with a futuristic
twist. This may have been the start of a new type of zombie film.<br /><br />My rating: 4/5
