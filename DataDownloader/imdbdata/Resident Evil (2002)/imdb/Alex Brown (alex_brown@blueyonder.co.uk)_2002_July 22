OK, I'll admit I went to see this film because of Jovovich.  Isn't she
lovely?<br /><br />However, this actually offered something a bit different from the standard
genetic experiment/DNA freak type of film you've seen a bit over recent
years.<br /><br />The innovative environment of being stuck in a &quot;hive&quot; underground and having
to save the world from the nasty virus offered lots of good action scenes,
some innovative effects and the occasional fright.<br /><br />Worth seeing.
