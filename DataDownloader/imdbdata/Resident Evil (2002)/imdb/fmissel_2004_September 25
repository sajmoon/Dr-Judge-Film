Resident Evil turned out a bit better than expected. It's a quite good
action/SF/thriller with execellent shooting and stunning effects. From
what I had read the plot would be a bit thin, and true enough the
simplicity of it, is the weakest point of the movie. That said, I still
think the acting is quite good all around, especially considering the
story they had to work with. The characters simply come over as
believable. It's like everybody believe in the universe that is the
essence of the story, which makes it real, even if is not deep
personality that is explored here. The above together with some really
good graphics and picture effects makes it a movie worth seeing. As for
the thriller part some of the scenes and effects were quite shocking -
in a good sense. The pace is fast like Aliens (2) so that your
attention is kept on the screen, even if not up to overall level of
that movie. I gave it a 7.
