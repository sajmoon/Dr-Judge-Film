This movie had all the elements of a great zombie hack and slash
great
movie if it hadn't been for the technical aspect of the movie. The story
line is gripping from the very start. The action is intense while the
special effects are incredible. Now for the but...<br /><br />What makes this movie hard to get behind and really enjoy are ALL the
mistakes in the movie. From Milla wearing clothes one second in the shower
to not wearing clothes, to the microphone boom in every other shot. Its
hard
to believe the intensity of all the shooting and killing if right when
someone talks the microphone comes down and almost hits them in the head..<br /><br />Whoever did the editing of this movie along with the sound crew
should
have been fired from the beginning and cleaned up what SHOULD have been a
cult classic from the start.. Too bad<br /><br />
