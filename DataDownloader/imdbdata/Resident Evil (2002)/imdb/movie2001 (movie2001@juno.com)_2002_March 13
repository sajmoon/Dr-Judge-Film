Resident Evil is by far the very best adaptation of a video game
ever.
Everything that was featured in the game is on screen, the story is there
and very true to the game. You will find the much loved zombies, the
possessed dogs, and the very nasty monster. Milla Jovovich does a great job
and shows once again that she is a very strong and physical actress. Paul
Anderson directs with pleasure and confidence and it shows in every scene.
Yes it does get pretty ugly sometimes but wasn't the game ?. A Lot of
people
surely won't like it. Even though The film is mainly targeted towards the
young audience that has been playing with the game for the past 5 years, it
does enter the great horror movie category with a big R.
If you like scary movies, great action, and especially are a fan of the
game, goo see it, you'll love it.
