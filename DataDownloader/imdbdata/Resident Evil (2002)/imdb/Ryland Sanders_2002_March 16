If you've ever seen a TV commercial for the video game this movie is based
on, you've seen the movie. Resident Evil is (or tries to be) an
action-thriller in the style of Alien/Aliens, but all the suspense and
intelligence that made those movies good was left out of this film. In fact,
this movie is so bad that it feels like someone took a good script and
intentionally took out the good parts and filmed what was left over. Shocks
are telegraphed from miles away. Somebody needs to tell Paul Anderson that
zombies haven't been scary since the 60s. The one possibly entertaining
monster was dispatched with ridiculous ease in 5 minutes. Even the gore was
surprisingly tame - for all the killing going on (and there is plenty),
there's very little onscreen blood. The acting, with the possible exception
of Michelle Rodriguez' smoldering glares, was awful. The story is barely
there, with elements lifted from a dozen much better movies mishmashed
together without thought for consistency, clarity, or pacing. The ending
sets up the sequel with such insulting transparency that they may as well
have named this film Resident Evil I. The only things this film have going
for it are not-too-shabby special effects and decent set design, but in a
way it's too bad - they're wasted on a movie this awful.
