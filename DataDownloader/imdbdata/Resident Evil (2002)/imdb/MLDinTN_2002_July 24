This movie was pretty good. The best scene didn't even involve zombies. The
best part was when the 3 people were trapped in that hall and the laser
comes after them. The end result showed show cool special effects.  The
zombies weren't too scary themselves. And I wasn't impressed with the zombie
dogs. They could have put more blood and gore in this.  The plot is thin and
Michelle Rodriguez has some bad lines. Milla is good as the gun-toting *ss
kicking hot chick. <br /><br />FINAL VERDICT:  If you like hot chicks kicking *ss, this is the movie for
you.  Milla not only uses guns, but also gets in on the killing with kicks,
punches, breaking necks, and even using her thighs.
