I saw this movie solely on the point that I was a huge fan of the games. I
went in expecting a movie based on resident evil but was surprised to find
no relation to the games, not even the characters or the infamous Raccoon
City. Instead they opted for a new set of characters, and comes off looking
like an alternate beginning for whole series. Resident evil has some great
special effects and of course fight scenes but the real star of this flick
is
Milla Jovovich (Alice). As the main character in a horror movie its her job
to get the people clinging to their seats while she is being attacked by a
assortment of monsters, and pulls it off flawlessly (though I think she
would have made a wonderful a Jill). Any fans of the game will want to
watch
the movie just for the last camera pan out (trust me), but for everyone
else
this movie does hold its own and is worth a look. I would recommend this to
anyone loves a good horror film or just some senseless violence, as for me
I
cant wait for the next one. (Its in Raccoon city I hope)
