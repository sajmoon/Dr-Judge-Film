I was liking this movie pretty much until i saw the cheesy graphics the
red licker thing had. I think the director should have waited to
produce better cgi to make this film. the imagery was awful for that
one monster. I hate when filmmakers do this to films, it seems so good
and entertaining in the beginning and all but then something stupid
pops up and ruins most of the movie for ya, for an example this movie.
this movie should deserve better ratings then it should because not
only did it have a better and more complicated story then most zombie
films it lived up to its horrifying story. tip: I have seen the sequel
to this movie (apocalypse) and it is one pile of crap, i recommend
seeing the first one only and then stopping there because if u liked
the first one u don't want to ruin the vibe by seeing that failure of a
sequel. Most sequels are failures anyway :) .Other than the horrible
cgi for that monster i give this movie an 8 for story,7.5 for
acting,7.5 for suspense,6 for special effects and overall is 7.3
