2002_December 9 

first of all i must admit that i am an avid resident evil player and was
skeptic of this film at first, yet still anticipated its
release.<br /><br />After walking out of the theatre i was astonished.  I remembered the days
when video games first came to the big screen.  I remember the
disapointment
following such flops as Super Mario Bros., and Street Fighter.  But then
there was the satisfaction of Mortal Kombat (not the sequel which sucked
hard core) and Final Fantasy: the spirts within.<br /><br />Resident Evil falls in line with Mortal Kombat.  The origional story is
kept
in tact except for a few details that had to be added to make the movie
work.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie tremendously, in fact a few scenes totally creeped me
out, just like the game does, while playing it alone, in a dark room with
the volume turned way up.  Although it will always be a trend setting
classic, i believe that Resident evil is totally the Night of the living
dead of the 2000's...there has not been a great zombie movie since then
until now.<br /><br />Recommended to sci-fi fans and gamers alike, and if you haven't tried the
game yet and liked the movie, i suggest you get with it.  Both the game
and
the movie are edge of your seat fright fests that will definately get your
heart racing.
