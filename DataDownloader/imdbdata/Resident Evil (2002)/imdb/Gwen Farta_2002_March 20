This movie rocks! It's definitely one my favorite horror movies and I have
seen a bunch, including many zombie movies: Night of the Living Dead, Dead
Alive, Dawn of the Dead, Evil Dead, etc. Most of these old zombie movies
are
so cheesy and filled with such fake, harmless gore scenes, however, that
they shouldn't even be classified as real horror movies.<br /><br />Resident Evil is really different. I entered the theater not expecting
much
at all, thinking it would just be another cheesy, stupid attempt to make a
video game.<br /><br />However, I tried to be optimistic since the movie had an R rating. All the
movies I've seen up until this one seemed like they were made for teens
with
overprotective parents, censoring all the original violence and gore
contained in the video game to avoid being bombarded by whining mommies.
This one is different.. It really depicts the real dark, horrific
environment of the original game series and captures the mood and feel of
the game. I couldn't have imagined it any better than this.<br /><br />I think Anderson could have also done really great with Mortal Kombat in
the
past if he had just captured this sort of violence and action and tried
not
to dress up the video game's plot. After all, the plot and character
backgrounds are only about a paragraph long in Mortal Kombat - they're not
what made the game great. It was the fast paced action and brutality, cool
martial arts and effects.<br /><br />This movie presents a very honest attempt to capture the video game
without
trying to dress up the storyline or the script too much. It also comes up
with some great ways of presenting things in the game that would have
sounded a bit cheesy had they presented them directly as they were. For
example, the zombies are never referred to as &quot;zombies&quot; in the movie.
Instead, they are simply referred to as infected humans who are virtually
dead but still animated because their brain can still function at a very
primitive level.<br /><br />As a horror movie, this is one of the least predictable ones I've seen and
definitely the most intense. There's a feeling of suspense throughout the
entire film and there are no real breaks to really relax the audience save
for a minute or two of dialogue here and there. From the very beginning to
the very end, trouble is happening. The gore scenes are really intense,
but
they are presented in a really gruesome way that none of it seems to wear
off by the end of the movie (ex - by the end of Evil Dead the gore wore
off
to the point that it was just plain funny). There's no dumb comic relief
character to provide cheesy punchlines as so many recent horror movies
have
started using either. The soundtrack, though a bit too heavy metal for my
tastes in some areas, really worked GREAT in my opinion with the
visuals.<br /><br />Now, don't expect this movie to win an oscar for its script and plot.
After
all, it is just based on a shoot-em-up video game... But that's exactly
the
best part of the movie: it presents a video game honestly as how a movie
should present one, successfully capturing the atmosphere and action that
we
all love in the playstation game.<br /><br />I have to say I enjoy brutality and action in stylish movies like this.
This
doesn't mean I only like these kind of movies, but they are a nice break
from the more serious movies where the script is the most important aspect
of the movie. I don't expect everyone to like it -  especially the
squeamish
or people who are into more serious movies - but this was just the type of
movie I needed tonight and I really hope they make a sequel. Can't wait to
see more Milla Jovovich too. :)
