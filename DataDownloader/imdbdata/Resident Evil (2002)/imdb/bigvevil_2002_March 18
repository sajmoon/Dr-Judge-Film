As a Special Make-up Effects Artist for motion pictures I'd like to give
my
opinion and review of Resident Evil. First off I'd like to say that the
movie wasn't that far off from the video games. The seamless use of pieces
from all the games are very well tied together in this action horror. The
cast delivers a non stop heart pumping ride from beginning to end. The use
of special effects was in my opinion some off the best to date. Bringing
the
older Remero style Dead movies to the 21st century, with style I might
add.
By far the best adaption from video game to film. I rate it an even 9/10 A
must see for action horror fans of film and video games. Don't let
negative
reviews keep you from seeing this picture. Judge for yourself. I promise
you
won't be disappointed.
