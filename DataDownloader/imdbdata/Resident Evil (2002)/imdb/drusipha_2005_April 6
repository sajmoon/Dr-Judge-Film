I don't even like horror movies in the first place, but this movie is
so great, it beats the odds and turns out to be a fantastic always fun
to watch non stop action thriller. Marilyn Manson's score is simply the
best score ever and will keep you glued to your seat looking sideways
and feeling your heart beat race. I understand the fans of the video
game mostly don't like this movie but I guess they failed to realize
that the story of this movie is about how the accident that caused the
infestation of zombies happened, it's a PRE-QUEL to the first Resident
Evil game. The director actually took the time to explain (commentaries
on the DVD) about how he came up with this movie's story - as he did do
this movie because he was a fan of the video game in the first place.
Also keep in mind that as a movie maker, he couldn't make a movie
exclusively for the fans of the game and I guess all are forced to
agree that if he did a movie intended exclusively for the game players
that would really limit the audience - and I am betting that if any of
the hard critics of this movie where to make one, they would end up
also realizing there is no way one can make a movie to such restricted
audience. I sure hope Paul W. S. Anderson is coming up with lots of
sequels to this movie. With that said, sit back (if you can) and enjoy
this wonderful movie.
