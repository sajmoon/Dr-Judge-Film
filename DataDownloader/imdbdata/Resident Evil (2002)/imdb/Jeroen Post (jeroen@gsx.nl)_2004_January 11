I am a huge fan of the videogame series, so I was waiting anxiously for
this
movie to come out. I wouldn't say the movie was a huge success, but I did
like the references to the game series. Al in all I would say: If you are
a
fan of horror movies or a fan of the game series you should go see it. If
you are just your average movie fan there are heaps of other horror flick
to
see.
