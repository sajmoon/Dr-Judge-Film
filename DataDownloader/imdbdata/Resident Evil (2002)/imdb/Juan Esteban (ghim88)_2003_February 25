This movie is a great job, Paul Anderson do a good Work in the direction
of
this movie, for those who are really fans of the video game this is an
obligated movie to see, the visual effects are very well done. the dark
lights, the sounds, and the zombies, puts you in a tension that is the
game
main object. Milla Jovovich do a great job kicking Zombie&acute;s asses. all the
scenarios are very well choose.<br /><br />This movie is surely one of the best that have been done about a video
game,because they don&acute;t try to re-tell the story they just tell it, and do
a
great job.<br /><br />just wait if the second one keeps the tension that this one left in its
shocking end!!
