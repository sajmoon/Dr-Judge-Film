When a film version of Resident Evil was originally mooted, George
Romero was down to direct, a fact that had long-time zombie fans like
me drooling in anticipation; eventually, however, Paul W.S. Anderson
got the gig, a guy who, to put it mildly, has never been as revered by
horror fans as old-timer George. While I have never really understood
the dislike for Anderson, finding his films to be mindlessly enjoyable
popcorn fodder, I had to admit I was also disappointed by the news, and
just a little bit wary.<br /><br />Imagine my joy, then, when Resident Evil was finally released and I
discovered that Anderson had done a bang-up job, delivering a superb
balance of ballistic action and atmospheric horror that stayed faithful
to the source material to please the gamers and yet remained just as
accessible to non-gamers; sure, part of me still wanted to see what
George would have done with the film, but I was thrilled with the
results nonetheless.<br /><br />Nowadays, having seen Romero&#x27;s last three chapters in his Dead series
(Land, Diary and Survival) and sadly realising the the guy no longer
has the magic touch, I reckon that hiring Anderson was the wise
decision after all. Although not as gory as I would have perhaps liked
(you can never have too much splatter), Resident Evil is a quality
slice of zombie mayhem: Anderson&#x27;s direction is slick, without being
too showy (ie., he doesn&#x27;t resort to an overkill of trendy editing),
there are some cracking special effects (for the day), and the cast all
do a great job, with feisty female leads (Milla Jovovich and Michelle
Rodriguez) not only kicking zombie butt in style but lighting up the
screen with their loveliness in the process.
