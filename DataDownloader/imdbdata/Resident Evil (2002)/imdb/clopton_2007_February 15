Every thing Anderson did right with video games movies on &quot;Mortal
Kombat&quot; he seems to have forgotten by the time he got to this project.
I&#39;m not even a fan of the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; games and I can tell that
this film changes much of the source material. I mean, was the whole
computer going nuts and underground laboratory aspects necessary at
all? It complicates the plot when it didn&#39;t need to be complicated. The
characters are stupid, that&#39;s for sure, often doing things wrong just
because it adds to the &quot;drama.&quot; Milla Jovovich is sort of attractive, I
suppose, but not much of an actress and certainly not strong enough to
hold down a project as weak as this. The fact that she was engaged to
the director at the time makes her casting even more bogus. The special
effects are pretty good with some interesting looking monsters.
However, it isn&#39;t much of a zombie movie as they don&#39;t really appear in
it at all and most of the gore is pretty soft. &quot;Resident Evil&quot; is just
plain dumb. Just to think that this could have been directed by George
A. Romero&#133; Grade: D
