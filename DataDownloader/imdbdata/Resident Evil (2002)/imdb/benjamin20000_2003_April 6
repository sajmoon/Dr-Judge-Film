This film would be nothing without the Manson/Beltrami score. The film is
very unrealistic and a bit stupid but very effective. I had never been
scared like this before... The ending is just awesome. Best video game
adaptation ever! Acting is not so good though... Paul Anderson is still a
so-so director but this is unquestionably his best achievement so
far.
