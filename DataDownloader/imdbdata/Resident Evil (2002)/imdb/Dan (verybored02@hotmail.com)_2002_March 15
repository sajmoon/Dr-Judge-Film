Wow! I went into this movie with doubts lurking in the back of my mind from
the horrors of seeing Mortal Kombat but they were quickly blown sky high.
This movie rocks the socks! It's nothing sensational or mind bending but
why
would one expect it to be. And the acting was almost as bad as the video
games (is.. that... Chris's blood?). It's action-horror at its best! The
plot is ...there, albeit nothing super but it's more than made up for with
tons of action scenes. You will jump, and you will jump more than once!
Suspense, Thrills, Action...it delivers all three, and its very
entertaining. Drool lil' poochies drool!
Overall 8/10!
