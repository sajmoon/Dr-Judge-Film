Resident Evil is an action movie dressed up as a zombie horror flick. It
has
pretensions to being in the same gory category as George Romero's classic
Day of the Dead.  In fact Romero was originally slated to direct Resident
Evil. He left the production and a fellow named Paul Anderson took over.
They made the right choice.  Anderson made a nifty joy ride of a movie
with
nothing in its brainless little head than to help you waste ninety
minutes.<br /><br />Resident Evil is the type of movie where momentum trumps plot. This is not
to say that story is unimportant. You need enough substance to involve the
audience in the mayhem but not so much that they will accidentally start
thinking. This movie has just enough characterization to make you worry
about the fate of the actors and just enough plot to give them something
to
do.  Something goes `Horribly WrongT' at a vast underground biological
research facility. All the lab personnel die and provide a pool of hungry
zombies.  A crack paramilitary commando squad goes in to find out what
happened.  That's about it for the plot.  That's all you need, really, to
string the action sequences together.  Okay, yes, there are some subplots
involving corporate espionage, love and betrayal but most of that just
gets
lost in the noise.  All you have to know to enjoy the proceedings is that
the good guys have to go from point A to point B without becoming
hors-de-oeuvres.<br /><br />The acting rises to the occasion but not much farther.  A fellow named
Colin
Salmon does look like he's destined for better stuff.  Salmon plays the
head
commando and manages to stand out in his brief screen time. Milla
Jovovich,
on the other hand, never seems anything more than the glamour puss she
really is.  Not that she gets much help from the script or costume
department.  Now bear in mind that these zombies are suppose to be highly
contagious. One scratch and you're a shambling mess. Ms. Jovovich,
supposedly a highly trained security expert, goes into battle wearing a
spaghetti-strapped purple mini dress. I suppose the thigh high Doc Martins
provided some protection but still.anyway, Jovovich has a likable screen
presence and does the requisite kickboxing moves with passable flair.<br /><br />Michelle Rodriguez, now, looks as if she knows one end of an Uzi from
another. She does go into battle wearing Kevlar but the ancient rules of
dramaturgy being what they are; she eventually takes it off so we can see
her t-shirt. To be fair, Rodriguez does a good job.  She shows more
personality than Jovovich and is believable in a highly contrived
situation.<br /><br />Despite the zombies you can watch Resident Evil without gagging on your
popcorn.  Gore is not Resident Evil's bag. The zombies here are a
civilized
lot. They do their feeding politely off camera. Yes, there is plenty of
blood being splattered around but not much more than you'd see in your
average Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.<br /><br />Resident Evil is one of those borderline movies that are fun to watch but
don't bear much discussion.  Should you see it?  Well, if your favorite
movie of the last ten years was Room With A View then there are other
films
you should see.  If you're in the mood for a swiftly paced, brainless
action
flick however, then you can't go wrong with Resident Evil.<br /><br />
