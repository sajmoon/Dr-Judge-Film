2002_April 26 

I went into Resident evil, having played all the games (except the
survivor
series...they suck) and I already had a pre-concieved notion of what this
movie would be like. Personally, if I think a movie will be good I tend
not
to read movie reviews before I see as they can really throw your judgement
going in.<br /><br />First off I must say... I love the resident evil line of games, they are
the
only games I have ever owned, they seem to be the only games I like. I
cant
explain that, but solving puzzles and killing the living dead just does it
for me. So when I heard that my fav game series is to be brought to life
on
film I thought, cool.<br /><br />But then I heard who was directing it. Paul W.S.Anderson. Mr. Mortal
Kombat... the man who helmed the unbelieveably bad &quot;soldier&quot;  So thias
lowered my expectations to almost flatlining. But, nonetheless I read some
of the IMDB user comments on this movie and wel, most of them were in
praise
of it, so I took my chances and went to see it.<br /><br />I must say My lower expectations helped a lot. I was genuinely frightened
by
this movie, the only other film that has ever scared me was the sixth
sense.
Dont get me wrong this is no where near that level of film, but it makes
good on the genre its based. Although the score (of lack of) can be a tad
annoying at times, distorted guitars dont always provide a good backrop
and
sometimes, it was unecessary.<br /><br />If your reading, Im not going to say much about the story, cuz its
resident
evil, less I say is more for you. But the movie plays a lot like the game,
the twists, the action... all very cool, and familiar.<br /><br />I loved this film, because I love the games, it was just like another
game.
If you like the games, see it, if you dont...then you might not like
it.
