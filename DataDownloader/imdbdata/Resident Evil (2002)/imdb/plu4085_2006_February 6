I was really disappointed with this movie, which had a pretty good
reputation and &quot;buzz&quot; upon release. It started out well, but about 30
minutes into it a feeling of cheesiness came creeping over me. There
were just too much illogical behavior, sloppy acting and derivative
ideas that the original promise fell apart. This continued throughout
the movie, so that towards the end I pretty much hated it.<br /><br />Some nice visual touches and an interesting premise, but all the movies
it rips off -- Aliens, the Romero zombie trilogy, Outbreak, The Relic,
etc -- are better than this, which adds to the exploitation feeling.
The lead characters are unsympathetic or incomprehensible, and given no
support by the weak actors.<br /><br />This movie follows the exact same pattern and weaknesses as Anderson's
&quot;Event Horizon&quot;, which however suffered less from its problems.
