Looks like a zombie shoot-em-up!  But the biggest surprise about Resident
Evil was that it was actually a pretty good movie.<br /><br />It wasn't all that suspenseful, but one of its many virtues is that it never
talked down to the audience.  The plot always remained under a veil, and the
audience, along with the main character, never gets to see the whole of it
together.<br /><br />There's a fair amount of gore here.  <br /><br />Don't kid yourself.  This is a zombie shoot-em-up.  As such, it has pretty
good dialogue, characterization, and plotting.  Don't go in expecting
something that will change the world, but do go in expecting a pleasant,
mildly thrilling action flick, with lots of exploding bodies and
bloodbaths.
