Well, after seeing it the second time it's quite cool. It's a little
bit unrealistic in some parts (i.e. the laser scene in the RQ
security
chamber: I wonder why the EMP is not broken...) but if you like
fast
action shockers it would be probably the right film for you.<br /><br />The film has it's own storyline and having played the game is not necessary
for understanding but makes it easier in some parts.<br /><br />Btw: it's the first time I have been asked for age verification.
