     Yes, of course this movie provided some exciting terror and great
horror but comparing this to THE BEST silent zombie horror film &quot;Dawn of the
Dead&quot; it just doesn't match up. Like most movies in the new age (2000s),
most of the horror films are just put on the market for a minimal amount of
scares and less than a 2 hour picture. This movie, in my eyes, was good, but
easily could've been better with more airtime. One of the few good things
about this movie though that saves it from being busts like &quot;Thirteen
Ghosts&quot; and &quot;The Haunting&quot; is that it definitely took the bad label off
video game movies which movies such as &quot;Double Dragon&quot; and &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;
failed to master.
     The casting for Resident Evil is probably one of the main flaws of the
movie. It including &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; star Michelle Rodriguez,
who's character failed to entertain as a tough girl who's puns are more
sickening than laughable. Also in the casting was Milla Jokovich, who had
starred in Joan of Arc, before; I absolutely think that this actor has no
skill whatsoever so i guess a role in this movie kinda fit her style.
Regardless of the fact, she was good as a superhero but honestly, these two
girls shouldn't of been on the top of the food chain. 
     All and all, the movie is good up until the ending, which drags on a
bit too far leaving the viewer unsatisfied slightly and leading into a
'should be' sequel. Judging by how they did at the box office, they should
have a sequel, but what I can't understand is why it is ranekd so poorly at
the box office. This movie although not the best zombie movie, should've
mastered the box office without a doubt.
