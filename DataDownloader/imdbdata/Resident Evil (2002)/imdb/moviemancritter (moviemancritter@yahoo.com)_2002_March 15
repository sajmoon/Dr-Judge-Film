This film is the best Film to ever be based on a Video Game.  The Film
Which
takes place 6 months before the 1st games, has a lot of scares, and
shocks,
and because it's not based on a game you don't know the out-Come.  Also
there are a lot of little things that will make the fans of the Games
Laugh.
The film starts out with the T-Virus leeking out into an underground
building called the Hive, and killing all of the people in side.  Then a
group of Combat fighters invade the nest and try to found any survivors
(good Luck).
