I went to this movie not expecting a lot but I'm surprised at how good this
movie turned out.  The actors did a good job portraying their characters,
the dead cast did a very good job also. The aspect of the movie that I
would
have liked to see more from was the Red Queen, it would have been nice to
see more interaction from her. Overall, this is a worth watching
movie.
