2002_March 16 

I am an avid player of the Resident Evil games. I went into the theatre
with
low expectations, expecting yet another horrible video game-to movie
translation. The moment the film starts though, you can tell it is nothing
like the anything that has come before it. It takes less than a minute for
all heck to break loose as the virus is released upon &quot;The hive&quot;(an
underground facility where the film takes place). The poor workers are
trapped and we witness an intense and very sad series of scenes. Cut to
above the complex where we meet out star, a beautiful young woman who
can't
remember who or where she is. In come the S.T.A.R.S members(the good guys)
to save the day. They are here to see what went wrong at the Hive. All of
this happens in only minutes...just hinting at how fast-paced this film is
going to be. We meet many people, majority very likeable as they go deep
into the Hive. The beauty of the film really comes out here. The film
started so quickly and left so many things un-explained that we feel
exactly
like the lead. Everything is a mystery and every second of the film is
part
of the mystery unfolding. Now I won't give anymore away....the film does
any
amazing job of setting everything up, and slowly building up until the
really scary stuff starts. Some of the acting at the start is a little
off,
but later the acting is great. You really start to care about the people,
and when people die the way the characters react really gets to you. To
top
it off, this film has some of the best writing I've seen in a long time.
I'm
a writer so I'm usually very picky, but I was very happy with this films
ability to surprise the audience. I see every horror movie, so I can
always
say what will happen next. In Resident Evil though, I had no idea what
would
happen. From opening scene to the completly amazing ending, I was
susprirsed. There is even one specific scene that is so surprising, even
after it happens you are still in dis-belief. By the time the film was
over,
everyone in our audience looked exhausted. I know I was. And if that still
isn't enough, the movie fits perfectly in with the video games. Must you
play the games to understand? No. People I saw it with have never played
the
games, but they still understood everything. However, if you have played
the
games, you will definitly appreciate the movie even more, if that's
possible.
