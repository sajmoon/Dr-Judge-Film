This is a movie that I&#39;ve watched over and over again. It&#39;s created a
mood all its own with a futuristic ambiance, a tough but tender lead
actress role (Milla Jovovich) and non-stop action, suspense, plot
twists and a show of innovative ways to get killed by zombies and in
other dangerous situations (don&#39;t want to give too much away).<br /><br />For those of us who have played the RE games, this movie provided a
nice background, a sort of prequel and more depth to what was going on
in the game and the reasons behind it. For anyone who hasn&#39;t played the
video game, this movie is an excellent stand-alone horror sci-fi flick
that is sure to become a classic and that does a good job of keeping
your eyes glued to the screen and your heart thumping while you wonder
what the poor characters will have to face next.<br /><br />I would give it a 10 in the genre.
