The Umbrella is a powerful and evil corporation that is developing
biological researches inside a highly technological and enormous underground
base called The Hive. When a viral sabotage takes place, the Red Queen, a
magnificent computer program that controls the Hive, goes homicidal and
kills everybody inside by shutting its doors in order to not let the virus
spread to the city above. A group of soldiers and experts are sent to The
Hive with the mission of controlling the situation and rescuing possible
survivors. What they find there is the result of the T-Virus outbreak:
normal people turned into blood-thirsty zombies, and now escape from the
Hive is the only thing they have to do.Terrific movie that recalls in many
ways the George Romero classic Day of the Dead, a claustrophobic picture
about scientists trying to endure a zombie attack inside an underground
base. Resident Evil, however, is like an upgrade of Day of the Dead, with
more action and better effects. Romero's flick was more brutal, but Resident
Evil relies more in atmosphere and suspense. We never get to see gruesome
deaths like in Day of the Dead(a gore fest!), and instead on focusing on
grotesque scenes of people being eaten alive, director Paul Anderson wisely
decided to give priority to the relationship between the survivors and their
fight to escape alive from The Hive.Outstanding special effects and
concepts(the idea of making the representation of the Red Queen as the
hologram of a little girl was a touch of genius, scary as hell),
surprisingly great and mysterious storyline that is unfolded correctly 
until the very end and brilliant performances from the cast help to
consecrate this as the best horror flick of 2002. Milla Jovovich, giving the
movie's best performance, comes out great in a part that really must have
demanded a lot: she runs, jumps, fires guns and do everything that is
expected from an action hero. I was impressed with her martial arts
abilities, too. Resident Evil: a must-see for every horror
fan!
