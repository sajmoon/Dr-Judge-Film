Why and who supplied the money for this movie.  This wasn't even a rip off
of the video game.  I had a more enjoyable time playing the game than
watching this movie.  I want my hour and a half back!  I give it a 3.  1 -
for convincing someone to make the film.  1 - for the really good
soundtrack.  1 - for gore.  That's it.  At least movies like the Toxic
Avenger, Evil Dead, and Re-Animator knew they were foolish and didn't take
themselves seriously.  Maybe the creators of this film should have
also.
