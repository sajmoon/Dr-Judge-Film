&quot;Resident Evil&quot; which is the highly anticipated big screen adaptation of the
popular video game series of the same name, is a very well done horror film.
 The story surrounds a rescue team that is sent to a large underground
facility to find out the cause of a mysterious accident that occurred there.
 When they first arrive, they discover three survivors: a young woman (Milla
Jovovich) who is suffering from amnesia and whose name I don't think is ever
mentioned, a guy named Matt (Eric Mabius) who claims to be a cop, and
another guy named Spence (James Purefoy).  When they finally get into the
Hive, which is the name of the large underground facility, they discover
that no one is there, or so it seems.  Soon the team members begin getting
picked off one at a time by bloodthirsty zombies, mutated dogs, and a
hideous monstrosity that has an incredibly long tongue. <br /><br />I must say that this film is above all things, very entertaining.  I've
never played the video games the film was based on, so I really can't be
sure how accurate the movie is.  The acting is all right, but it isn't good
nor is it bad.  The movie does maintain a constant level of creepiness,
which is good.  I must say that &quot;Resident Evil&quot; does keep you on the edge of
your seat from start to finish.  NOTE: One thing I do want to point out to
gore fans is that this movie is no where near as gory as you may think it
is.  I was pretty disappointed by that.  I mean a zombie movie, especially
one like &quot;Resident Evil&quot; should be dripping with bloody violence and gore,
but it isn't.    <br /><br />I really like the fact that Paul Anderson (who directed another movie
adaptation of a popular video game, &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, as well as a previous
horror film &quot;Event Horizon&quot;) directed this film.  I love both of those
movies.  I really don't see why so many people hated &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;.  That
is probably the only movie adaptation of a video game that up until this
film, is really worth watching.  &quot;Event Horizon&quot; while it wasn't a perfect
horror film, should have almost certainly pleased any sci-fi fan.  That was
a creepy movie right there, despite its flaws.  However, where &quot;Event
Horizon&quot; failed as a horror movie, Paul Anderson makes up for it here in
&quot;Resident Evil&quot;. <br /><br />A lot people claim that Milla Jovovich is hot (seeing that she reveals
almost everything in this movie is worth the $20 for the DVD), but I don't
really think she's that hot.  Personally, I prefer Michelle Rodriguez over
her any day.
