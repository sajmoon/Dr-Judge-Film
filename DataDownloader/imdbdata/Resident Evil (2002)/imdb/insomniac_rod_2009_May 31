Straight popcorn Horror cinema. I don&#x27;t agree with some users who state
that the producer and director was heavily influenced by the game. <br /><br />In my opinion, this movie lacked of the creepiness and eerie atmosphere
of the original Resident Evil game. What do I mean? The extremely
dangerous, morbid, haunting and macabre atmosphere felt in the mansion
in part 1 and in the streets of Racoon City in part 2. <br /><br />The movie deals with a scientific explanation towards the events and
most of the action sequences but I feel that it lacked of the
creepiness and sadistic nature of the game. <br /><br />Yes I enjoyed the extremely detailed and expensive action sequences but
I wanted a more zombie oriented movie.<br /><br />The direction that this movie took should please fans of Sci-Fi and
Survival Scientific Horror.
