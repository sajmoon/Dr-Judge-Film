One thing for sure could be said about RESIDENT EVIL. It is not special at
all. The special effects are cheap as cheap can get, which makes one wonder
&quot;why bother&quot; when the zombies were ripping off Romero's zombie flicks. And
let us not forget the ever present video soundtrack blaring at precisely the
wrong times. The games were far better.<br /><br />A virus is let loose in an underground corporate construction called the
Hive. An army swat team has the sense to kidnap three people suffering
amnesia and send them down to shut off the Hive's computer, which murdered
all the employees down there.<br /><br />As the tradition with all video game movies go (SUPER MARIO BROS., DOUBLE
DRAGON, etc.), this movie sucks. But it is actually better than the ones
previously mentioned and any other video game movie in recent memory. The
advertised fight between Milla and the dogs was the ultimate disappointment
though, and nothing really made RESIDENT EVIL the movie stand out from
RESIDENT EVIL/BIOHAZARD the video game. Play the real thing
instead.
