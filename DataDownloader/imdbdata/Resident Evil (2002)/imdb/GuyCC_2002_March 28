Admittedly, I had my hesitations about this film.  I really, really wanted
to like this movie, but the way some magazines and on-line sites were
talking about the plot synopsis (a computer turning people into the undead
and not the game's T-Virus), I had some concerns.  Fortunately, after seeing
the film, my concerns were eased, and such rumors didn't come to
pass.<br /><br />This film now resides in my &quot;Top 3&quot; (Mortal Kombat and Final Fantasy being
the other two) of video game based films.  And this is how the film should
be looked at: A film that relies on a video game for its source material and
story set-up.  The film starts out slow, offering background information on
the Umbrella Corporation, and introducing the viewer to the victims caught
up in a situation they were ill-prepared to handle.  The scenes (especially
the Hive map layout) are set up like a video game.  Again, for this type of
film, it can get away with this and work properly if kept in that frame of
mind.  Once the zombies appear, the tone of the film gets much more intense,
especially with scenes from some of the game's more &quot;popular&quot;
enemies.<br /><br />For a horror film, it's not as gory as I would have expected.  It does have
its fair share of &quot;gross&quot; moments, but succeeds more in some good old
fashioned jumps and false &quot;gotcha&quot; scares scattered throughout the film. 
What really surprised me was that the film actually had some brief flashes
of nudity in it.  Then again, this really isn't a movie for kids, and I'm
glad this wasn't dumbed down to be so.<br /><br />The acting was decent, introducing new characters to the RE world (which
kept things unpredictable as to who lived and who died, which made it more
interesting in my opinion), and being the same director who did the original
Mortal Kombat film, it was filled with plenty of flashy fight scenes to fast
music.  What really sat well with me in regards to this film is that the
movie made plenty of subtle references to elements from the games (the
crows, Nemesis, the mansion, limited ammo comments, etc.) without screaming
to the audience &quot;Hey, this prop is also from the game!  This scene is just
like the game!  We included everything whether it needed to be there or not
just to keep RE fans happy!&quot;  While I'm sure some people would have
delighted in seeing the protagonists pushing around statues and opening
doors with playing card-shaped keys, the movie rewards the die-hard fan with
plenty of references if they look hard enough.  The feel of the game was
captured without going overboard.<br /><br />Granted, some people have likened the film to &quot;Aliens&quot; and &quot;Night of the
Living Dead&quot;, but that's something of a moot point.  Yes, there are
similarities, and no the story isn't the most original thing out there, but
the game series does take inspiration from such films to enhance the tension
for the game.  Basing these elements from the game for a movie only makes
things come full circle.  The film is meant to capture the feel of the game
and provide some entertainment while it's at it.  In that regard, it
succeeds in what it sets out to do.<br /><br />So is it worth it?  If you enjoy the games, then yes.  It's fun, it's got
its creepy moments, it's got a great ending sequence (excellent &quot;closure&quot;
for the film, if you can call it that), and hopefully the sequel won't go
the way of the second Mortal Kombat film (read: bad).<br /><br />Hopefully, there will be a Director's Cut DVD.  I have a feeling that some
scenes were cut out of this.  Excellent popcorn fare, and a future addition
to my DVD collection.
