2002_March 16 

I played 3 out of the 4 games out in the US, and I absolutely loved the
movie. I went with people who never played the game, or just 1 or 2 of
them,
and they all felt the same way.  I had a feeling it was going to be a
little
bit like &quot;Aliens&quot; but I didn't mind.  Game fans will notice the nods given
to the game here and there.  It was a very enjoyable experience, but I
think
I'm going to have to see it again. Milla was just too darn distracting.
