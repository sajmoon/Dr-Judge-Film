My old roommate use to watch this film all the time and laugh when people
died.  He was really flaming and annoying though.  He use to watch the
Golden Girls three hours a day!  Therefore, I hate this movie with a deep
dark passion!  I give it a 2.  Oh also, its based on a HORRIBLE video game! 
Go see a good movie like Fargo or something!
