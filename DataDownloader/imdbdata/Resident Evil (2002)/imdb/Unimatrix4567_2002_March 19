John Carpenter must be smiling.  &quot;Resident Evil&quot; is yet another example of
a
film inspired by this master horrormeister --- more exactly, by some of
his
weaker creations (like &quot;Ghosts of Mars&quot;).  An unabashed knockoff of &quot;Night
of the Living Dead&quot; plus &quot;Alien&quot; plus &quot;The Thing&quot; plus &quot;The Poseidon
Adventure&quot;, Evil gets off to a promising start with some great CAD-views
of
The Hive where The Red Queen is turning everyone into blood-sucking
zombies.
The best part of the movie: the trip down the slice-and-dice laser
corridor
just outside the Queen's chamber.  This in itself is worth the price of
admission.  Other than that, the script is convoluted, the acting stiff
and
the finale a weak excuse for a sequel.  So much of &quot;Resident Evil&quot; simply
does not work, yet when it does hit the target it can make John Carpenter
proud.  I just hope the inevitable sequel comes with a better
script.
