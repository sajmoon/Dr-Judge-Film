This film opens in the &quot;Hive&quot;, the massive underground research complex
run by the Evil Umbrella Corporation. A vile containing a deadly virus
is broken and it sifts it's way throughout the entire complex, wiping
out everyone. This, if in all reality, would not have happened if the
Hive had not been entirely connected by the ventilation system. But
hey, I guess it goes to show, Military intelligence isn't too high in
the movie world either.<br /><br />Casting includes Milla Jovovich as Alice, who was found in the mansion
suffering from amnesia, but coincidently remembers how to kick ass, and
looks great doing it. Michelle Rodriguez is Rain, by far the toughest
and sexiest member of the task force sent into the Hive to check things
out. A female commando, who knows how to get it done, go figure. And
then there are the other guys in the cast who survive past the
30-minute mark, but they're just the bait for the baddies. Most of the
movie consists of the main characters shouting orders, and occasionally
getting hoarded by zombies. Oh, and there's a deadly laser beam, which
is fun to watch for the most unexpected decapitations I've seen.
However, I was impressed with the licker, and the &quot;Cujo&quot; wanna-be
zombie dogs.<br /><br />Director Paul Anderson gives the film a nice Holly' gloss finish. And
the music, industrial metal which got very annoying, managed to drown
out some of the lousy dialogue. This was more of an action movie than
the horror flick I expected, it doesn't even stride with George A.
Romero's zombie films.<br /><br />The one thing that messed up the movie for me was the unnecessary last
scene that sets up the sequel; you already know (if you've played the
game) that one was coming. Thanks, but I'll stick to the game&#133;
