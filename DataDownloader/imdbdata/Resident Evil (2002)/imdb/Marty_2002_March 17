It totally rocks.  If you like Dawn of the Dead, you'll love it.  It's
stylishly done with some decent plot devolopment that is faithful to the
video game but with a few surprises.  It's definitely not just another
video
game movie.  Probably the best horror movie I've seen in a long time.
Don't
listen to any of the negative reviews...this movie is good.  Overall, it's
very well done and and Milla Jovovich does a great job at playing the lead
character, &quot;Alice&quot;.  Definitely worth checking out.
