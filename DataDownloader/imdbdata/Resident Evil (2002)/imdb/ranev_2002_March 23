There hasn't been a commercial zombie movie in quite a while thus I was
quite excited to watch this one. So I joyfully trotted to the cinema, paid
for my ticket and took a seat. It all started quite nicely with people
ruining around and having their heads chopped off by berserker elevators.
Then I smiled when Mila Jovovich courteously showed a nipple because you
simply can't have a good zombie movie without gratuitous nudity. But the
further I got into the film, I mean the movie, the more disappointed I
became. This movie is so tame! I wanted to see zombie brains splatter on
walls. I wanted to see people being decapitated in graphic detail. I wanted
to see Mila shoot a double barreled plasma powered bazooka twice her size at
that tongued creature and to make it blow up in tiny little chunks of bloody
goo. This is a zombie movie guys, where is all the gore? <br /><br />
