2002_December 6 

All I got to say is this movie surprised me. When I saw the tv ads I
said
to my self &quot; Man that doesn't look like it would be any good&quot; So I didn't
go
to the Theater to see it(big mistake).In stead I got the DVD and when I
watched, I was blown away by how good it was. The composing, The camera
work
and the creature creation were outstanding not to mention the acting and
script were decent.The begining and ending of this film are symbolic to
each
other and are by far the best begining and ending sequences I have ever
seen
in a Film. All in all this is a great film.
