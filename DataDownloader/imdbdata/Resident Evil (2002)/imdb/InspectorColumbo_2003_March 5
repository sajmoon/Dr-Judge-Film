2003_March 5 

Well I watched the movie and I really liked it. Well its not a Terminator
2,
or Aliens but hey its a movie about a game what do you
expect?<br /><br />But the only thing I REALLY can say about this movie that you just have
to
watch it for yourself.
I read 2 dozens of comments here and its really surprising.<br /><br />One says the acting is great the other one says the acting
sucks.
One says the special effects are good the other one says they are
awful.
And so on and so on..<br /><br />I rarely have seen a movie that splits the people as much as this one
does...
So go out rent or buy the DVD and have some fun (or write a comment here
about how bad the movie was :-)
