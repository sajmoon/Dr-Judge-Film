The beginning of this flick is really good and dark, and it have some
good elements and a good story, but somehow Paul W.S. Andersson manage
to make it ridiculous with stupid kills and bad zombies. I have played
the video games and I enjoy them, but when you do a film about a video
game you have to focus on the story and not in the action 'cause, here
comes the revealing part of this review, aren't the same!!!!!!!!!!! All
action video game to be great it needs a deep story and action that can
keep up the story. In a movie is all about the story, and some action.
But when you put more emphasis in how the dudes are going to die and
forget all about the plot in the middle of the movie, well that can't
be right.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich saves this movie from the abyss, she's a great actress
and I'm in love with her, so everything that she does seems great to
me.
