Located in Racoon City is the Umbrella Corporation headquarters, where
in an secret underground compound called the &#39;The Hive&#39; one of their
experiments known as the &#39;T-Virus&#39; is unknowingly released. So the main
computer system &quot;The Red Queen&quot; locks everyone in &quot;The Hive&quot;, which the
virus turns every living thing in the facility into fleshing eating
zombies. So, a military crack force is sent in to shut down the main
computer and pick up any survivors within three hours. One of them they
come across is Alice who&#39;s suffering amnesia, but she slowly starts to
puts the pieces together, while confronting this massive problem.<br /><br />I remember when I was originally going to see this at the cinema, but a
friend of mine conned me out of it, in which we saw the sentimentally,
wretched war flick &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; instead. Well, I finally got
around to seeing it after all of those years and well, meh! Now I just
wonder what got me interested in it in the first place. I&#39;m no fanatic
of the video game and I have no idea how true it is to the story, but
from what I&#39;ve seen of the game. Anderson was no were near in capturing
the dark and creepy atmosphere. Alternatively he brings his loud, rapid
and glossy stylistic touches that find its way in most of his other
films. I actually don&#39;t mind his earlier efforts like; the enjoyable
rubbish &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; and the mildly creepy &quot;Event Horizon&quot;, but this
project and even more so &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; I found mindlessly under
whelming and kinda flat. Sure, I&#39;m not expecting a meaningful
masterpiece (although some specifics and character development wouldn&#39;t
hurt), but the entertainment factor is rather botch. Maybe if I saw it
when I was initially going to, I might&#39;ve got more out of it and see it
in a different manner. Since obviously its aimed at a certain target
audience and to make a profitable franchise. I just found it far from
gripping and the involvement was really lacking. That can be
contributed to the story (which has decent plot device) that seems to
go nowhere and the stock characters are pretty vague with their cheesy
one-liners and thin dialogue.<br /><br />Well, since that was the case I was hoping the action, blood splatter
and zombie madness would spice up this shindig! I&#39;ll admit the film has
a couple of striking set-pieces and the pace keeps the film moving, but
these aspects lose out to the &quot;Look at my shinning new toy! I don&#39;t
know how it works, but it looks great!&quot; attitude. The film visually
looks good. But it just got caught up trying to be too flashy in it&#39;s
snazzy techno appearance than actually executing some tension,
excitement or even some gore. Instead we get cheap jump scares that are
plain predictable, lame slow-motion, tame combat and pretty clumsy,
looking CGI. You got the usual chaotic editing worked around the slick
camera-work that captures the crisp art direction. Surrounding these
glossy fixtures is an impulsively, blaring techno mental soundtrack.
Style definitely wins out here! The performances were rather vapid,
though Milla Jovovich fits the buck in the lead role. She might not
have much to do but to kick ass, but she does makes the most out of her
undeveloped character. Michelle Rodriguez plays a very lazy stereotype;
the tough female soldier who won&#39;t take any crap! The characters here
actually share a real common interest with those in &quot;Aliens&quot;, but at
least in that movie that had interesting personalities. *Hmm* Now I&#39;m
sitting here looking at the DVD cover of &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot;,
which has on the front cover &quot;Bigger, better, action-packed&quot;. Well,
hopefully it lives up to that wrap or, maybe it will be equally
forgettable.<br /><br />No way is it awful. But simply, it&#39;s a weak and very dumb action-video
game hybrid that lacks the firepower and is unintentionally laughable
when it came to shove.
