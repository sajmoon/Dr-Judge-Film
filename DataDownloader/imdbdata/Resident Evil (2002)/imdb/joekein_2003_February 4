Regardless of what anyone says about this film, I enjoyed it. It had me
jumping out of my seat and held my attention with ease. The acting was a
little shaky and the dialogue wooden but the action set-pieces were
great.
If I had one criticism for the film is that it wasn't gory enough - for
Zombie movies to fill their potential, you have to show them to be at
their
most frightening, which involves feeding and just generally gory stuff
they
get up to a la Romero, In Resident Evil you don't really see the zombies
feed - they are just there to be shot.<br /><br />Paul Anderson does a more than good attempt at a world-renowned game, but
with a bigger budget and a better script, it could of been up there with
the
likes of &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;. So Im hoping with the sequel he can
put
right all the little niggles in it.<br /><br />9/10
