Don't expect a whole lot of oscar winning writing here, but I found this
movie to be extremely interesting. <br /><br />The acting is actually good from some actors and moderate on others, and
some of the lines are a little hammy, but overall the movie is terrific
horror film.  I found myself consistantly frightened during some points of
the film, and when I wasn't, it was certainly a pleasure to watch the
kinetic Milla Jovovich preform.<br /><br />The soundtrack was at times inappropriate.  The special effects often
obvious, and there was a hint of predictability, but surprisingly (due to
the fantastic direction of Paul Anderson) I still found myself jumping. <br /><br />This movie was worth my 5.50, and I think it is well worth
yours.
