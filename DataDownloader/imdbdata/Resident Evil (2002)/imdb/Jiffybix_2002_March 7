You would think a movie like this would be another stupid special-effects
disaster with zero plot. The unique thing about it though, is that it uses
special effects to build the plot. Most movies would have the special
effects.. and that's it. I highly suggest this movie to all special
effects/gaming fans. This is NOT another final fantasy! 10
stars.
