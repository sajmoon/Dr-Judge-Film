I really enjoyed the movie.  I mean, the script may not have been the best,
and you hardly get to see the actors do any acting, but the it still keeps
you on the edge of your seat.
I went with my mother, and through half of the movie, she had her eyes
covered with a Tribute magazine from the lobby.  It was gory and tastefully
horrifying, and those of you who have seen &quot;Cube&quot;, you may notice a
similarity between the beginning of that movie and the corridor scene in
Resident Evil.
I have liked Milla Jovovich ever since I saw &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;.  She's
really good at kicking ass.<br /><br />I'd give this movie a 7/10.<br /><br />(ok, this is my first review i've ever written, i just saw this movie.  I'm
not a professional, and whatever i say is just my immediate opinion.  I'm
under 18 years of age, so i'm not gunna sound very good at writing, but oh
well, i love movies and i expect to write many more!)
