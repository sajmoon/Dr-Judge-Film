I really like this movie because it is well written, well directed and
Paul Anderson chose great actors to portray the the commandos. Michelle
Rodriguez, Milla Jovovich, Colin Salmon are definitely the better out
of all the other actors. The zombies are not put in your face at the
beginning and there is a cause for the infection unlike the night of
the living dead movies and also unlike the night of the living dead
movies the zombies are less like the stereotypical zombie. The story is
easy to get into. Although most of it is not based on the games as far
as i&#39;m concerned this was a great movie. Paul Anderson is a genius for
writing and directing this movie. Acting 8/10. Story 9.5/10. Directing
10/10. This movie is still scary and it is most definitely better than
its sequel.
