This is a good SCIFI movie. But I watched the Movie &quot;28 days later&quot; before
I've seen this movie. As I saw both &quot;Resident Evil&quot; and &quot;28 days later&quot; the
plot seemed so a like. Unlike the movie &quot;28 days later&quot;, &quot;Resident Evil&quot;
took place with a bad virus spreading in a building (and not all England)
making people that is infected with the virus want to eat other people to
stay alive. As one bite reaches one person, they will soon become
infected.
My favorite part in this movie was that when that blond lady runs into the
crazed dogs and Kicks major ass. That was cool, I wish they showed an
instant replay of her kicking those dogs butts. Especailly when she kicks
one of them one room through the other room, breaking the
glass.
I know there is a game based on this movie. I never played the game, but the
movie looks better.
I hope there is a sequil to this movie.
I rate this movie ***
