What is wrong with the people that didn't like this movie?! i mean it<br /><br />was a great pack of action, suspense, horror and a nice picture...<br /><br />on top of that it is a adaptation of a video game, damn i never saw<br /><br />a adaptation from any video game that was good, that movie was<br /><br />great, i jumped a few times in my seat, the acting was pretty nice...<br /><br />the make-up were very cool, the special effect were also great!<br /><br />damn the people should stop comparing movies in the same rate,<br /><br />i mean a action movie is not comparable to a love story movie, or a <br /><br />horror movie... it is like comparing a porshe, a big motor home and<br /><br />a mini-van, they are all vehicles but not the same kind, so stop<br /><br />comparing movies like star wars with titanic and braveheart<br /><br />people, and rate a movie on the same type of movies...
For anyone that love action and horror it is a very nice movie to see<br /><br />trust me...
