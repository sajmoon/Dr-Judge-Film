I don't know what movie the reviewers are seeing, and the commentaries
here
border on moronic babble. RESIDENT EVIL represents one thing clearly,
and
that is the generation gap between lovers of good b-movies and horror
films
and the younger folks who don't have the background to dig what RE
does.
What the stupid slobbering gore-twits and the &quot;film&quot; snobs are missing is
RE's
true, uncompromising nature; no self-referential, humorous one-liners or
pompous
revision of the Zombie Attack genre. RE revels in understanding what is
terrifying about
the living dead.<br /><br />That understanding? The impending attacks, the coming of the zombies,
their
craven need. Zombie movies prey psychologically: they are out there,
they
will not stop, they want us, they ARE us. That's the horror behind the
Zombie,
that's what makes the Zombie truly unstoppable--as long as we exist, the
Zombies
will exist.<br /><br />The attack scenes are hardcore enough, coupled with any
lifelong Zombie lover's imagination, to provide the truly impressive
tension
that drives
RE. All credit for that should go to Anderson the director and writer: he
manages a strong,
kinetic movie devoid of the worst of horror cliches--in fact, Anderson
manages
to respect the audience enough to give them genuinely eerie imagery; I had
no
problem accepting the world of the Hive, of the Umbrella Co, and of the
T-Virus.<br /><br />And Milla Jovovich is superb; a fantastic actress entering her prime gig in
RE. She manages
to show human frailty even as she displays very cool martial abilities.
Jovovich
is simply perfect as a beautiful woman discovering that she is a high-level
professional
killer as unstoppable as the waves of zombies that descend on her.<br /><br />Anyone who loves good, solid, uncompromising horror films should check this
out (uncompromising
up to a point, of course; at certain points, gore in grand quantities
SHOULD
have come,
for the story dictates it; the gore is minimized, and you can thank the
same
board restrictions that have voided most realistic violence and sex
from
films and replaced it with cartoons--a Zombie movie is a gore movie, and at
some
point, as Romero knew, you have to show just how awful it is to be eaten
alive).
But let me say this: I'm willing to pass up on the hardcore viscera in
order
to get a
full-bodied, enjoyable, and non-idiotic horror movie. I'll even accept
the
poor CGI on the inhuman monsters, the non-zombies, to get zombies back on
the screen again.<br /><br />Certainly RE is a step in the right direction. For everyone wishing for
the
return of the horror film to full popularity, RE's as good as it gets. As
the
1950s science fiction movies led to the '60s psycho fests and then to
'70s
mind-blowing blood-letting, all gore-hounds should keep in mind
that
good Zombie movies without the intestines will only open the door
to
movies that DO contain those scenes, and for all other American
films
to loosen the restrictions. But RE proves it isn't necessary, and even
if
we don't see the flesh tearing and the brains blowing out of the back of
the
head, our minds perceive it, and our minds are where the zombies
have always fed most heartily.<br /><br />Excellent movie. Don't miss it.
