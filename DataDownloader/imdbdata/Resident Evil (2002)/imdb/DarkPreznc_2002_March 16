A Must See For Any Resident Evil, Horror, Suspence, Sci-fi, or Movie Lover.
As Far As i'm Concerned It's One Of The Best Movies This
Year.
The movie gives some good background for the games and even lets you in on
a
few things that the game left you in the dark on but so not to spoil the
film thats all i'm going to say
