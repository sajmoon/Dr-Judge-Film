I know resident crappy isn't even the slightest bit clever but I'm too
mad
to be clever...This movie is absolutely terrible. What bothers me even
more
is so many people seem to love it. The subject matter has so much
potential
which is evident in the games. This could have easily been rated PG-13 if
there was one less &quot;f**k&quot; and if the producers didn't want you to think
the
movie had to be good cuz it was rated R. The most fun  had with this
movie
was when me and my friends were watching it and making fun of all the
crappy
acting and story. Michelle Rodruguaeauss or however you spell her
name..(I'm
too lazy to check) always has a scowl on her face like she just smelled
something really bad...maybe it would make sense if there were some damn
corpses there but there is hardly any gore. And when she says &quot;When I get
outta her I gotta get laid&quot;(or something like that I was laughing to hard
to
remember.). Well good luck with a scowl like that...ewwwww. Or maybe she
was
scowling cuz she knew how bad this movie would be and that her carear
would
be in limbo..doomed to be in awful movies like blue crush crush for the
rest
of her life. bad bad movie
