After seeing this movie, I had mixed emotions.  The actors did a much
better job than others in movies based on video games.  The characters
were people that you actually cared about and who seemed real enough to
feel like they could be people you know.  James Purefoy as Spencer was
especially interesting, adding layers as the film progressed.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the main plot of Resident Evil revolves around zombies.
In this day and age, that shouldn't be difficult to make interesting.  A
little imagination on the part of the makeup and wardrobe departments
and some creative directing could've made this quite exciting.  Instead,<br /><br />I felt that I was teleported back to the 1950's, with slow zombies
walking stiff-armed and looking less scary than those in Michael
Jackson's Thriller.  At the screening I attended the audience actually
giggled at some places in the movie which were supposed to be
scary.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who isn't either really bored
or a big fan of the video game.  And if you do go, please don't take
your young children, since the blood and gore
