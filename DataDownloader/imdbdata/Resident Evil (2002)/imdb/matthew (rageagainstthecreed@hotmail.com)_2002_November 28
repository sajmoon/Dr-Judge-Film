I gotta admit, when I found out this movie was going to have nothing, at
all, to do with the games, that's what scared me the most. Then, when I
finally got a chance to see it, I was a little relieved. While it had
nothing to do with the games, it really wasn't that bad. Truthfully, the
movie didn't have to be call Resident Evil, they could have used some
different names or other forms of viruses to get into humans, without
calling them the G or T virus. The characters in this movie are also
lacking
some spirit. There are a few, I even admit, that were amazing though.
Alice
(Milla Jovoich), Rain (Michelle Rodriguez), and Chad Kaplan (Martin
Crewes).
These 3 really made the film really worth watching. I suggest if you like
horror flicks, pick this up, it's one of the better ones in the last
while.
But, if you like zombie flicks I'd suggest first, Dawn of the Dead, and
Night of the Living Dead, then watch this after them. well that's all.
have
a scary day
