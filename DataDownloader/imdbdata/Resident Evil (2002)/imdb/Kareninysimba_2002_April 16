I never thought I'd see another zombie-drama movie after the 70's or after
Michael Jackson's &quot;Thriller&quot;. I think it's cheap, non-sense gross bloody
scenes. Weak story basis. Funny when it shouldn't: why is Milla Jovovich
covering her private parts when she's totally alone in her bathroom? I think
that making a horror thriller is one the most difficult task to do for film
makers, but I'm sorry, I think that walking-hungry zombies are far from what
people wants to see since the 80's zombies. Without the beauty and charm of
Milla it had been a flop.
