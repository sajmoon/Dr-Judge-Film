If there was ever a video game that deserved the big screen treatment,
it
is Resident Evil.  I have always been a fan of the game, so I had eagerly
anticipated this film.  I really like this movie, even though it does
stray
away from the game's story line a little.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about this movie is that it doesn't follow the
rules set by normal horror films.  In most movies you can normally figure
out who is going to die.  This movie is shocking in how fast it kills off
main characters.  I will not go into details for those who have not seen
the
film yet, but I could not believe that a few of those characters fought
through such adversity, only to be killed off a few minutes later.  It
really keeps you on your toes.<br /><br />The movie flows at a substantial pace, and never really gets boring.  I
hate movies that rush out the gate, and then crawl to the finish line.
The
special effects are great, and I love the casting.  Milla Jovovich and
Michelle Rodriguez are fantastic.  I will admit that I wish you could see
more of Jovovich naked.  If only those stinking paper towels would fall at
the end!<br /><br />Bottom line:  If you liked the game, you will like the film.  If you
have
never played the game,you probably will still like the film.  It is just
really good.
