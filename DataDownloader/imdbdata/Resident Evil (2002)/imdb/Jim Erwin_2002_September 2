2002_September 2 

The basic idea for this movie is pretty cool, and visually the movie is
engaging. Unfortunately, it looks like they spent all their money on
visual
effects and creating a cool look, and nothing on the script. One of the
basic rules of story telling is show, don't tell. Most of scenes involve
the
characters standing around explaining to each other (i.e. explaining to us
in the audience) what is happening. This makes the story move incredibly
slow.<br /><br />The most interesting part of the story is how Alice (Milla Jovovich) has
lost her memory. She knows that she's directly involved somehow, but
doesn't
know what she's done. Unfortunately she never reveals much about herself,
so
we don't get to know her enough to care about her. There are a couple of
very awkward partial nude scenes that look painfully like the producers
wanted to show Jovovich naked and she wouldn't play ball.<br /><br />This one really isn't worth the effort. The action scenes are few and far
between, and aren't very well done. The story is so painfully slow that it
seems to take forever to get started, and never really delivers enough
energy to put you on the edge of your seat. It's really a shame because
there are some very cool plot elements to the story, but it's just so
poorly
written that you're left wondering what this movie could have been if it
had
been given to a capable writer.
