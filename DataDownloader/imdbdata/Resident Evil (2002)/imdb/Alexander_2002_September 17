first when i read about the resident evil movie in 1996 i thought it
would
be a really scary film, like the videogames...then a few years later I
saw a
clip from the film and after that clip i changed my mind and after seeing
the trailer from the completed film i changed my mind one more time this
time i thought that it would be a good movie.
but after have seeing it i completely changed my mind.
comparing to the game, in the movies all zombies movies fast like
h*ll
and there&acute;s no sudden zombie attack from lockers etc.
and i have no idea why the had that computer graphics about that girl etc
and hard rock music which i think never wolud have fit in in the actual
video game.<br /><br />so i think that if they would have done the film after the videogame,
with a
simular mansion and camera angels as they have in the film...<br /><br />so now i just hope that someone will do a good tv-game movie, maybe
&quot;house
of the dead&quot; film will be a bigget hit, let us hope so
