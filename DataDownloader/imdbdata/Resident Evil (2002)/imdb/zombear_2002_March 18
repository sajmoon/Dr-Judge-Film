Not only is this the best movie to come from a video game since Paul
Anderson's own Mortal Kombat (RE may have even topped MK), it's the best
American zombie movie in ages!  Sure, it could have been more atmospheric
(the RE games provide a feeling of dread that the movie didn't equal) and
there could have been more gore, but as it is, it's still an astounding
effort.  The creature effects were good (though the CG-ness of some of them
was too noticeable), the zombies were creepy and relentless, and Milla
Jovovich was fantastic (and hot!)  <br /><br />It ain't quite Night Of The Living Dead or Return Of The Living Dead but
it's better than most of the Italian gore-fests, and certainly worth seeing
a time or two.
