I thought it was a good movie if it didn't already have a story. But
because
it did, I feel that it had nothing to do with the game. I love the game,
and
in &quot;it&quot; are puzzles and small mysteries that need to be solved. The movie
did not display anything of the sort. I am just disappointed.  Hopefully
the
sequel will have these things. I will understand if the movie just needed
an
intro, and follows up on the REAL story the next time around.
