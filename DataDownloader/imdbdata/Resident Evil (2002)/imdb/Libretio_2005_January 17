RESIDENT EVIL <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS<br /><br />A group of highly-trained commandos enter a research facility which has
been sealed shut following the release of a deadly toxin, but their
escape route is cut off by hordes of flesh-eating zombies created by
the toxic gas...<br /><br />Based on an ultra-successful computer game, this routine potboiler
(directed by Paul W.S. Anderson) marks time between set-pieces, and
barely makes an impression. Despite a top-line cast (including Milla
Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, Eric Mabius, James Purefoy, Colin Salmon
and Martin Crewes) and excellent production values, Anderson&#39;s movie
replicates the computer game&#39;s limitless excess, and reduces its
characters to the status of zombie fodder, despite a handful of plot
twists which set the dwindling survivors against one another as the
zombie hordes descend from all sides. The action scenes are chaotic but
unmemorable, and some of the gore appears to have been curtailed for
censorship reasons. Watchable, competent, forgettable. Followed by
RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE (2004).<br /><br />(English version)
