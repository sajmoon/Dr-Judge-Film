Packed with loads of action, I've got to say, I really enjoyed this movie. 
Also, I'm a great fan of Milla's, I think she is so beautiful and talented. 
Michelle Rodriguez is definitely one to look out for as well.  I love her
fearless tough-girl demeanor-she's awesome!  I'm not too familiar with the
video game, but it does sound interesting...even though there were scenes in
reference to Thir13een Ghosts and how could we forget-Night of the Living
Dead, I still thought it very entertaining.
