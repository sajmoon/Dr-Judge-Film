This film is more of a ripoff of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD than it is based
on the popular video game.  It concerns a bunch of military recruits trapped
in an ex-science lab fighting a supercomputer and zombies, zombies, and more
zombies.  That's where the derivative nature of the film comes in.  They
spend the bulk of the film shooting and being attacked and eaten by zombies.
 Perhaps fans of the video game will find some value here, others beware. 
U.S. version was edited of gore to receive an &quot;R&quot; rating.
