A major disappointment to say the least. All a video game movie needs to
fulfill it's limited purpose is cool monsters and some good action
sequences. So what made them think they could get away with Night of the
Living Dead? This crap was okay in 1965 when it was done the first time and
not so bad with the various George Romero remakes and sequels but all this
is is a bigger budget B flick. Utterly predictable and full of &quot;startle
scare&quot; scenes. This is the other side of 13 Ghosts but with a plausible(for
the genre)idea and lousy monsters - &quot;more brains!&quot;.
Maybe okay for the under 15 crowd as they may not have seen the zombies
before.
