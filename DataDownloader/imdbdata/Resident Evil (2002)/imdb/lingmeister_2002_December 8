Seeing another movie coming from a video game background, and not a gamer at
all, I was expecting another lame-o video game adaptation.  So my
expectation wasn't very high.  I was surprised at how much better it was. 
The plot was pretty straight forward, get in, get the job done and get out. 
But in most aspects of it, it held me at the edge of my seat for much of the
movie.<br /><br />Not that it was perfect.  The way the movie is laid out seem to follow a
video game's strategy of conquering room by room, save the flashbacks, which
slowly revealed the main characters' purpose.  The different level of laser
slicer served no purpose except if you are at the joystick yourself (a
mechanism in which these people, who knew the ins and outs of the system,
didn't know about.)  We don't know how the sister was ever outside the
compound.<br /><br />It seems to be a much better version of John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars,
which I found to be an absolute bore.<br /><br />
