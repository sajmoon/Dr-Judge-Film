The game was fascinating. However; the movie cant catch up the success
of the game. But; anyway, there are some special things which make
movie a good one.<br /><br />Main reason is Milla Jovovich. She has a divine beauty. Secondly visual
effect are good. Especially; when trooper trying to enter computer
center of laboratories. However, if the budget of the movie had been
big enough and the crew has been chosen carefully for some specific
jobs, the movie would be great.<br /><br />To sum up, the movie is a kind of worth to see. If you like the game
you will be satisfied enough.
