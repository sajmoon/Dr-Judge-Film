i voted this movie a 1 because it was the worst game to movie, movie i
have ever seen. it doesn't even follow the plot from the game. when
does Alice come into play? i mean I'm just wondering if Paul Anderson
even knew what the game about. being a hardcore Resident Evil fan i
could name everything wrong with this movie but i don't have all the
time in the world to do so. it would have been a good movie it if it
wasn't based of this particular game and it had the title changed. this
director/screenplay writer is know for bad movies so if your going to
watch this movie be prepared to be bored out of your mind. he could
have at least went with the video game plot because it was already a
good story and he didn't have to ruin it. he made resident evil look so
bad with this movie. the zombies didn't even look like zombies.
basically it was a bad script, bad actors and bad director. and if u
haven't played the game and u watch this movie, don't think its a bad
game cause this movie really made resident evil look bad. this is just
an opinion from a Resident Evil game fan.
