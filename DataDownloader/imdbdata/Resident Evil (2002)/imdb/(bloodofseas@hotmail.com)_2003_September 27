from when Milla walks out of that place -- to the end, it's a masterpiece,
about 2 mins ;)<br /><br />as for the rest, that could of been shortened to the lazer scene and some
2-3 fight scenes. couple in the not aweful at times soundtrack and you
have
a music video, nothing else.<br /><br />the only good actor, miss Jovovich, does so when she's not saying
anything,
nice idea! otherwise she's looking pretty bad, well, when you compare her
to
miss Leeloo, but that girl did happen to be perfect.
