I love short comments so here goes: great movie, take it as it is, enjoy
it...I loved Aliens and this film is as great - and surpasses it for the
action at the very least. You will not regret this movie - I didn't play
the
game and it didn't stop me from loving it (although now I want to play the
game *S*). You won't waste your money on this one - if you like the
genre.
