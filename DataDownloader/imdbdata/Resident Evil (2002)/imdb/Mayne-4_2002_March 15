I wonder why no-one compares Resident Evil with Ghosts of Mars. Both
feature
masses of monsters (zombies in RE, possessed settlers in GoM), lack of
story, practically same type of film end and a female protagonist (Milla
Jovovich in RE, Natasha Henstridge in GoM). Even that armored train from
GoM
shows up in RE again.<br /><br />Differences are that GoM does not take itself as seriously as RE does.
There's just *a bit* more story in RE. I think RE's setting also looks a
bit
better.<br /><br />Dislikes: Computer game-like transitions in RE (&quot;Party is on level x,
entering red queen chamber&quot;). Unnecessary shock effects of that annoying
&quot;Buh!&quot; type.<br /><br />However, RE is much fun if you like gore - and have some beer with you
:-).
