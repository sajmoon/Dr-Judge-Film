Simply amazing! What's great about this movie is that it's the first good
video game to movie transition I've ever seen! As an avid Resident Evil
fan,
I noticed that even though the characters and storyline differ from the
popular Capcom games, many of the basic elements are still there! I even
noticed similar sound effects and background music at certain points of the
movie!<br /><br />For all of you Resident Evil fans out there, go see it! You won't be
disappointed! As for those who haven't played the video games before, you
will enjoy this as one of the more scarier movies since
Aliens!
