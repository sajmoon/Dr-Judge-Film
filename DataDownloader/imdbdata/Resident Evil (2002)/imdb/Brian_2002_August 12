I saw the Resident Evil movie once it was released on DVD.  I can say that
the plot was interesting.  Some of the scenes with the zombies were hokey.
Some were a little too violent, though you could tell it was
fake.<br /><br />I haven't played the video game before so I don't know how it ranks up with
that.  The characters weren't developed very well but you kinda got a hang
of who they wre into the movie due to the flash backs.  All around it was
an
alright movie.  It was worth seeing.  Don't rent this movie just to see
Milla Jovovich naked.  Its not worth it.  The ending does leave open for a
sequel which they will start filming this year I hear.
