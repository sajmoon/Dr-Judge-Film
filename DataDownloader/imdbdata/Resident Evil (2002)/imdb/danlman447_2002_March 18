I went to see this movie because I like the Sci Fi genre but cautioned
myself to expect to see a bad video-game movie. Much to my surprise
Resident
Evil turned out to be even better than I had hoped. This movie has plenty
of
gore, however not just for gores sake but for a great plot line that worked
well with it. The plot elements came together very nicely and contributed
to
a much more plausible zombie story than has ever been done in the past, the
corporate security computer &quot;The Red Queen&quot; was also a nice touch. Although
at times predictable, possibly intentional, it was surprisingly
suspenseful.
The acting was very good and believable, and for those would-be acting
critiques out there this was not intended to be a drama, but an action
thriller. As mentioned in another's review, Milla Jovovich is an
accomplished actress that I believe made a wonderful performance and not
just because she is awesome to look at. I gave it a 9 out of 10 (sorry,
very
few movies deserve a 10).
