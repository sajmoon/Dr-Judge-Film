The latest in the long line of video game adaptations is as
unremarkable as its predecessors. The overly and needlessly complicated
story centers around an elite SWAT team that goes on a deadly mission
to investigate the spread of a biological virus, but ends up fighting
for their lives against flesh-eating zombies and mutations. Like most
films of this only marginally successful genre there are some exciting
moments of action and violence, but the film lacks a certain spark, is
poorly directed, and has a frustrating tendency to let its music drown
everything out. Had potential, but is far too uneven to be a total
success. **
