Resident Evil undoubtedly works far better on the small screen than it did
at the cinema. There is no way any director (no matter how experienced)
can
bring a video game to life without sacrificing art in the process.
Anderson
has been here before with Mortal Kombat but injected into both movies
enough
competency and style to make them respectable in their own
right.<br /><br />With Resident Evil he has given us a decent story with a touch of
complication and a fair amount of suspense. My main gripe is the fact that
the movie looks far too slick to be as truly disturbing as the grainy and
filthy Zombie movies of the '70s. Plus the violence isn't all that graphic
but there is still plenty of fun to be had in watching a bunch of office
workers turn into the living dead and it's scary how cheaply their lives
are
considered by the Umbrella Corp. they work for. I'm certainly not going to
work in an office for a company like that if that's what they're going to
do
to me.<br /><br />The characters are thin but not entirely one-dimensional. You do end up
siding with some of them and feel urgency in their futile escape from the
underground skyscraper (shouldn't that be 'Groundscraper' then?). Milla
Jovovich is cuter here than she was in Fifth Element or Zoolander but
Michelle Rodriguez just plain annoys me. All I've ever seen her play is a
moody Latino who frowns all the time. It's time for here to try and expand
her range a bit and I wish someone else played her character.<br /><br />Video games will never make for classic movies. They can be mind-numbingly
terrible (Super Mario Brothers, Double Dragon) or competent, such as this.
Just turn a blind eye to the really, really bad FX at the end when a CGI
monster goes on the rampage. My old Commodore 64 was capable of better
graphics.<br /><br />The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen and a choice of Dolby 5.1 or
DTS
5.1 soundtracks which sound great but, as a result, also serve to
highlight
he meaningless and clich&eacute;d Marco Beltrami/Marylin Manson 'score'.
