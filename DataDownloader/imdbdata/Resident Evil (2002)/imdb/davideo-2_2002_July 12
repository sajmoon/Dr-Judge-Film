STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal
Instead*Avoid At All Costs<br /><br />Those who own a PlayStation games console of any sort will be well advised
to stay at home and play your copy of Resident Evil,should you own one.It
will be much the same as watching the movie,only you get to see it your own
way.But then,for those who find the game too hard to crack,seeing this might
be an adviseable option.The movie has a really great soundtrack,some ace
action and brilliant jump scenes.What it also has however is a
tired,thoroughly cliched story,bad acting and terrible,terrible dialogue.To
put it more plainly,this flick appeals to exactly the audience it was
intended for,and on that level,it's pretty exciting fun.But you can't help
but think if it had had the above things,it would have been just that little
bit MORE fun.***
