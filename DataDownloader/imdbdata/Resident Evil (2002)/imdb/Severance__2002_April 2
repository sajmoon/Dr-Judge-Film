When I saw the trailer to the Resident Evil movie, I actually became a
little bit disappointed. It didn't seem to have much with the different
video games to do. Except for the original plot &quot;An evil company, releases
a
massive virus which turns humans into living dead&quot;.<br /><br />Though now, after I've seen it, I'm really surprised with the amount of
places and objects you find simular with the objects and places of the
different games. Even some scenes seems to be taken from the
Games.
As for me, who have played all of the games, that is very
amusing.
Still Resident Evil isn't just a good movie based on some video
games.<br /><br />My words are simple.
Resident Evil might look like an ordinary 21 century action/horror,<br /><br />but there's more to it than you'd ever expect. The Story is so intense and
the actors are really doing a great job, including the Zombie actors. It
was
a long time ago we've got a really good Zombie movie, but now we are
liberated. :D<br /><br />To finalize it all, I will rate it.
Really I would like to give it 10/10, but there's something that gave me
the
feeling om incompleteness. It is indeed a superb film, but they could've
at
least given us 40 minutes more of Zombies and terror.
So therefor I will give it 8/10 and pray that they bring us another
Resident
Evil movie, this time based on the first games' story.
