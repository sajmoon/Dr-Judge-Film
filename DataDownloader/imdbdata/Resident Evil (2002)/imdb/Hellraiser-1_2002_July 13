Ok, this movie is well done and some people appreciate it quite a lot but I
felt it just as a disappointment. Milla Jovovich is gorgeous and the zombies
look good but the scenes involving them are not gory at all.I think Paul
Anderson did a good job in &quot;Event Horizon&quot; and even in &quot;Soldier&quot; which was
better than expected but here he uses a too much video-clip style and the
movie was quite uninteresting. And there is another thing I cannot
understand, if this movie was so little successful in the USA, why are
thinking about making a sequel?At least I hope it is like the Video game,
that is,a zombie flick more than this is: A mixed of a lot of things all
together.
