The whole movie was fantastic!! The zombies were the most creepy and most
vicious i have ever seen in a horror movie. But most of all the giant
monster thing(if their is a name for it). The mutated Dobermans were cool
to. The only thing that made me upset is that like most movies now a days
.. .    IT ENDS OFF IN A SEQUEL!!!!!   In other words  To Be Continued . . .<br /><br />But like I said it was a great movie. Good acting, great special effects,
cool mutated monsters, good looking heros, and major arsenals. A must see.
