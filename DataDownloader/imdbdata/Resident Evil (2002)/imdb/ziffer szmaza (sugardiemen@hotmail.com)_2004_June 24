Reading the summary most of the people probably thing I am all set to bash
Resident Evil. Actually I'm taking just the opposite stand because I really
loved this movie. Lets just say love doesn't even come close to define my
feelings for this movie. Okay, I'll admit, this movie isn't Oscar material
except maybe the special effects, but its really a good movie if you happen
to like the RE series. Even if you haven't played the games you might just
learn to love it.<br /><br />Human struggle for existence against all odds always makes a good tale. But
I should say I'm not one for zombie movies. Somehow I find them meaningless.
Maybe because playing the games beforehand or the fact that I willed myself
to like this movie ever since I heard it was coming, I really liked this
one. Another reason for me liking this movie is &#150; Michelle Rodriguez. There
can never be a reason not to like a Michelle Rodriguez movie for me. The art
direction was awesome. The concept of the Hive was super cool. The dogs were
scary. Scarier than the zombies. The laser scene was trend setting. What I
really liked was the Red Queen, a holographic representation of a
super-computer modeled after the head programmer's daughter. To hear the
innocent voice of  a little girl saying- `You are all going to die down
here' - is really chilling. That's Red Queen for you.<br /><br /> I didn't know anything about the movie before it was released. I just saw
its trailer once in UK Top Ten. So, I didn't what really to expect. I was
hoping to see all of Jill, Claire, Leon and Chris. I was real disappointed
not to see any of the video game characters. To tell the truth that killed
me but things like that happen. It seems like the movie is going to follow a
storyline slightly different from the game series starting with how the
T-Virus spread. In the games the T-Virus was spread by James Marcus (as in
Resident Evil: Zero). The movie stand is different. I guess the games and
movie storylines will deviate from each other a bit.<br /><br />Glitches? Milla Jovovich is definitely one of the most good looking women in
the world. In fact she's stunningly breathtaking. But somehow I didn't see
her as Alice. She looks too precious. It might be because of the scene she
was introduced in. Anyone who knows Jill, Claire or Rebecca know that they
are really tough women. Maybe Milla J. looked fragile to me because she was
next to Michelle Rodriguez. And boy! is she tough.<br /><br />I hope I get to see the game characters in some future RE movie (haven't
checked RE:A till yet). So gotta go. What am I doing next? Well, to quote
Rain, `when I get outta here think I'm gonna get laid!!'<br /><br />
