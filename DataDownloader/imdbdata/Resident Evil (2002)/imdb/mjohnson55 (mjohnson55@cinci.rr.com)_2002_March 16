Resident Evil is the best video game to movie translations ever, but they
should have stuck with the storylines of the games more. Basically  in the
simpliest terms, it sort of follows the games, but the lack of the
creatures, and main characters sort of brings this movie down. I was hoping
to see Wesker, The giant spiders, Alexia, Alfred, Steve, Claire, Jill or
Barry, and I was really wanting to see the Nemesis (&quot;Stars!!!&quot;) or Tyrant on
the big screen. The new people did a great job portraying the newcomers to
the series, but it would have been alot better if they would have included
any of the ones mentioned above. The special effects were great, and the
licker looked just as creepy as it did when you saw him for the first time
in RE 2. The zombie scenes were done effectively where it looks like they
are really overpowering their victims. Overall a good all around movie, if
you are a fan of the series, you'll like it.
