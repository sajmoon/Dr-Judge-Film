This is a throwback to the movies of the late sixties and seventies,
which were meant to take the fun out of movie watching. It reverts to
the old Nazi standard of Hollywood in which any woman with dark hair
and any man with fair hair must die, and the Nazi ideal of the blonde
woman and brunette male live. The movie bends over backwards in its
Nazi idealism, and it wouldn&#39;t be so bad if it wasn&#39;t so trite and
predictable. We get this 99 time out of a hundred, and it is dull, and
it just isn&#39;t fun for anyone who isn&#39;t a Nazi. Can&#39;t say much about the
plot. There is none. Can&#39;t say much about the acting. There is none.
Can&#39;t say much about the characters. They are one dimensional cardboard
stereotypes. Can&#39;t say anything good about the writing or directing.
Total bomb. And depressing, too.
