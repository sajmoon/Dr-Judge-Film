&quot;Resident Evil&quot; isn't definitely the worst horror film ever made,but movie
of the year?!...come on!I'm sad to have say that this is actually more
action flick than horror.As cool as the games are(at least the first two),as
mediocre is Anderson's film.Almost no gore at all,pretty bad acting(the
characters in the computer game almost seem lively)and no uncanny atmosphere
to be found.And,by the way it's mostly kind of rip-off of &quot;Dawn of the
Dead&quot;.Still there are some enjoyable moments to be found here.There's one
reasonably creepy sequence in the mansion near the beginning.The sequence
where several characters are trapped in the bright,shiny corridor with a
deadly laser beam is the highlight of the film and contains one of the
coolest and most unexpected decapitations I've seen in awhile.The battle
between Milla Jovovich and creepy dogs is also excellent.The climax is okay
and it leaves the door wide open for a sequel.The film is well-made and
looks really nice,but the lack of gore can't be forgiven.However there are
better zombie movies with plenty of red stuff out there for example &quot;Zombi
2&quot;,&quot;Burial Ground&quot;,&quot;The Beyond&quot;,Romero's &quot;Living Dead&quot;
trilogy,&quot;Flesheater&quot;,&quot;Meat Market&quot; series etc.The game is also a lot more
scarier-if you want a really good,albeit forgotten horror film which is
quite similar to the first &quot;Resident Evil&quot; game,please check out
&quot;Scarecrows&quot;(1988).
