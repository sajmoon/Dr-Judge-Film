I didn't really think this movie would be any different from other zombie
films - the lead role is in a model's hands, it's taken from a game, all
the
features of a bomb @ the box-office. But it really surprised me. Sure, the
acting wasn't anything more than people walking around, holding guns and
swearing at each other, but they sure as hell do it with gusto. Milla
Jovovich does a pretty decent job as Alice, and I really loved the way
Michelle Rodriguez did her character; you could tell Rain's bitchy nature
by
the way she *looks* at you - and her one-liners directed @ the zombies are
quite funny.<br /><br />The reviews given to this movie in the UK was terrible; &quot;A typical
gore-fest&quot;, &quot;Nothing different&quot; and stuff like that, but I believe that
this
movie was aimed in the general direction of teens, and anyone my age will
definitely love it - the gore level is high, the language is sufficient,
and
there are nude scenes for the guys to enjoy. So, overlooking the acting
(apart from Michelle Rodriguez), this is a simply terrific piece of work -
since when do we teens care about the acting? Bring on &quot;Nemesis&quot;,
guys!
