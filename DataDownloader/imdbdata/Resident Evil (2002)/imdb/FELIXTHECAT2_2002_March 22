This movie is leaps and bounds better than other filthy video game movies,
such as tomb raider...while this film is much better than that waste of
celluloid its not that good...it has such huge gaps in it i dont know what
happened....like the t virus turns all these people into zombies...and
they
somehow upon turning into zombies became these mangled axe weilding
psychos...i know they are zombies but when did they get beat up...and
there
are rooms full of them...but then the rooms conveniently empty when they
needed to add some dialogue to the movie...or when we find out who the bad
guy he ...he is instantly able to move among the zombies without a care in
the world...until he gets to the train that is...and then there are just
stupid things...for instance, the whole lazer cutting defense system that
kills the good half of the rescue squad...why not just have the grid lazer
at the beginning...there is no need for this top lazer...bottom lazer that
pops up in anticipation of your jump..and then the grid..what is that
filth...overall i would say this film has not evaded the inescapable doom
of
being a video game movie...wait till its on USA up all
night
