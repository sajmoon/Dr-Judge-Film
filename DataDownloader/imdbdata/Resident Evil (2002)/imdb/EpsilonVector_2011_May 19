The horror genre is one of those genres that have a few highlights
buried in a noise of clich&#xE9;s and imitators, and zombie movies tend to
be the worse offenders. But I was pleasantly surprised by this one,
especially considering who its director is. It actually feels original,
and it achieves this by (for the most part) avoiding all the typical
zombie movie scare tactics.<br /><br />Instead of slow, cautious exploration of a zombie infested territory
interspersed by spurs of panic when zombies are actually encountered we
have a constantly urgent pace that doesn&#x27;t rest until the end of the
movie. Instead of music that attempts to surprise the viewer by being
quiet for a while and then exploding when a zombie is encountered, we
have sonically unnerving industrial rhythms with some subtle but
carefully orchestrated ambiance (composed by Marilyn Manson). The
environment feels dangerous and really looks like a real place (at no
point does it feel like the room was designed to fit the upcoming scare
sequence), and the movie is filled with scenes that feel off-beat to
the pace but in a fantastic way, from the surreal way Alice&#x27;s
recollections are handled to the surprising attempts at humor, to that
psychotic scene where Rain bitterly teases the zombies with her blood
dripping hand. This is a zombie movie that isn&#x27;t trying to scare you
like zombie movies do, and I don&#x27;t even care that it doesn&#x27;t follow the
games. It&#x27;s good in its own right.<br /><br />The cast is great too. Milla Jovovich as Alice is fantastic, and looks
equally awesome in that red dress. Another highlight is Michelle
Rodriguez as one of the soldiers, who is essentially reprising her role
as a marine in Aliens, and I totally approve.<br /><br />So why didn&#x27;t I gave it a perfect rating? Because the movie still has
clich&#xE9; zombie movie moments, and that lack of originality stands out
twice as much considering how much original ideas there are in this
movie. When these moments happen they&#x27;re a reminder that no- you didn&#x27;t
finally find another great horror movie; you just found a good one...
and that&#x27;s a shame.
