(This is my first review comment so I hope it is OK) Resident Evil is
based on the video game (VG) franchise developed by Capcom. My
understanding of the VG is that it is about a dark time in the future
when a &quot;T virus&quot; developed by a megacorporation for military purposes
escapes into the public and begins to re-animate dead people. The movie
does not drift far from this plot but has some particularly compelling
twists.<br /><br />1) As much as the VG is about a dark megacorporation, the movie
captures this ethos quite succinctly. The attitude of the corporations
agents and officers mirror what you, I or anyone could turn into if we
were to more vigilant in our own workplace. It is a dark future and the
movie captures the mentality of those salarymen, even the mercenary
soldiers, quite well.<br /><br />2) The acting is very purposeful and there is good chemistry. I believe
Milla had a role in this because she has a natural flair for adding a
unique and useful dimension to a cast as well as projecting her own
self as she did in 5th element. The actors quite clearly have looked at
the VG and they all do a good job of capturing the feel of the VG and
its mysterious, perplexing surroundings.<br /><br />3) I believe it will become a classic like Alien because the movie has
so much to tell about how things could go so horribly wrong in
humanity&#39;s future. This is not just another zombie flick of
supernatural resurrection made by John Romero. The movie adds a new
epic dimension spawned out of the dark imaginations of the best
imaginations in Tokyo. The movie falls into the same genre as Akira or
Ghost in a Shell - a retelling of a dark forbidden future where you get
to see what you could become like were you to live your whole life
there.
