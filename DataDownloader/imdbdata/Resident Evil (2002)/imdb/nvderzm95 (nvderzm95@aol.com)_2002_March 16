I just want to say that I thought Resident Evil wouldn't be that good,
considering it was different from the game.  But I was wrong.  It was a
really good flick, and while it didnt follow the game religiously, it was
based on them.  The writer did a great job developing the backing plot,
with
the virus released in the Umbrella Corporation's underground headquarters.
I really liked the effects, especially the zombies, the dogs, and the
Licker.  I'm going to sound weird in this, but I thought it wasnt gory
enough.  It's rated R, so they could have gotten away with a lot more
blood.
In a certain scene, it was unrealistic at the shortage of blood.  Don't
get
me wrong, I don't want some ultra-violent gore-fest, but at least
realistic.
Resident Evil has good action, a few good scares, and good effects.  I
definately recommend RE to fans of the game series, zombie movie fans,
horror movie fans, or simply movie fans.  I'm probably going to see it at
least one or two more times in theaters.
