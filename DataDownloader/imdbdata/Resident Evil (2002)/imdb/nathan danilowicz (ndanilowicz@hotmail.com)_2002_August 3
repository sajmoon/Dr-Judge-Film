<br /><br />Impressive clinical cinematography and an appropriate techno-goth
soundtrack
by Marilyn Manson are perhaps the only admirable elements to this video
game
adaptation that was historically doomed from the get go. Director Paul
Anderson (Soldier, Event Horizon) churns out yet another flat action-gore
flick that would be successful if it could only satisfy the enthusiasts of
the video game franchise by the same name. The plot stays faithful to the
game. A deadly virus escapes a multi-billion dollar underground research
facility owned by the Umbrella Corporation, mutating everyone infected into
a mindless zombie. A Special Forces team led by sexy super model turned
actress Milla Jovovich (Alice) is sent into the facility to investigate the
contamination and stop the virus from spreading. To complicate matters, a
highly advanced AI super computer, the Red Queen, toys with the team,
sometimes aiding them and sometimes leading them to their
deaths.<br /><br />The acting is just as flat and as full of one-liners as the game itself.
And
while this film may not feature a star-studded cast, at least the
screenplay
(Also by Anderson) could have been crafted well enough to allow Milla
Jovovich room to play a dynamic character (As she did in Messenger).
Michelle Rodriguez plays Rain, the secondary gun totting Lara Croft wanna
be. Her one-liners include `The bitch isn't standing now. ` `Blow me.' and
`When I get outta here I think I'm gunna get laid.' Her contrived bravado
is
weak in comparison to earlier sci-fi tough girls such as Private Vasquez of
Aliens.<br /><br />Based on poor box-office earnings and the fact that this film was yanked
from theaters quite quickly, it seems that most moviegoers preferred to
wait
for this flick to be stocked on the shelves of Blockbuster. And if clich&eacute;
dialogue isn't enough to distract from otherwise entertaining gunfire and
bodily dismemberment, the film's tedious pseudo-scientific explanations of
the virus and how a human body is &#145;zombified' will remind you that your
remote control sports a fast forward button. Paul Anderson and like
filmmakers who attempt to rationalize the paranormal should take a lesson
from horror greats like George Romano. Romano's Night of the Living Dead
series didn't waste time on explanations and rationalization. There are a
few disputed origins of the zombie race: maybe a meteor crashes into Earth
and spreads radiation, maybe a virus escapes a research facility, fine,
leave it at that. Accept the fact that zombies are the walking dead and
they
feed on human brains. That is all we need to know.<br /><br />This film is not totally undeserving of appreciation. There are a few good
scenes and some decent makeup effects. One of the best scenes showcases
Milla's Alice facing off against a pack of mutant dogs, which is also
highlighted in the film's trailer. It looks great partly because of the
fact
that the dogs are not computer animated composites. The effects team saved
the CGI for the flesh-hunting mutant that acts as the movie's end level
boss-an early experiment by the Umbrella Corporation that is pitted against
Alice in a battle royal on a speeding train. To put it bluntly, this
digital
creature has the artificiality of a direct to video sci-fi release. The
most
nail-biting and sadistically creative scene comes early in the film. The
Special Forces team, who by the way arrive out of nowhere, get pinned down
in a chamber of deadly lasers as part of the Red Queen's defense
mechanisms.
Without giving too much away the team falls victim to an interesting game
of
agility and dissection. The effects here look great and will leave the
faint
with an upset stomach.<br /><br />Photographically the film is a winner. It is clean and well lit, the colors
are beautiful and the camera angles are well thought out. Unfortunately
we've seen this ultra clinical cinematography a lot in recent films and it
may not have been the best choice for this story. A better choice would
have
been to match the video game's dark, gritty aesthetic. The contrast between
the Umbrella research facility and the bloodied, ragged zombies makes for
an
inconsistency that is all too noticeable. On a poignant note, Marilyn
Manson's original score almost carries the film. It is an effective creepy
mix of slow brooding goth-noise and clean accelerating techno-metal.
Hearing
Manson's musical arrangements sans his juvenile angst lyrics makes you
appreciate his talent and puts his controversial image and ideals
aside.<br /><br />If you prefer movie endings not to be neatly wrapped then Anderson's habit
of leaving room for a sequel will delight you. The film ends right where
the
second installment of the video game picks up. There is resolution of the
initial conflict but then a new one is revealed just before the credits
roll. A Resident Evil sequel is in the works, but as the laundry list of
bombed silver screen video game adaptations suggests: Super Mario Brothers,
Street Fighter, Double Dragon, Final Fantasy, Mortal Kombat (Also by
Anderson), I wouldn't expect to get your $8.50 worth at the theater.
Overall
the film is high on action and lacks suspense. Suspense is what actually
made Anderson's 1997 film Event Horizon watchable. If you want to see more
of this director's work then I recommend Event Horizon. It is almost the
antithesis to Resident Evil in its gritty aesthetic and tone. It also
delivers good dialogue, an interesting story line, a character twist, and
some wonderfully explicit gore. I rank RE a 5 out of 10.<br /><br />
