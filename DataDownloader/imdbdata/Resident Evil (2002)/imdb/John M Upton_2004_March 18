Dear oh dear....<br /><br />An unnecessary and irritating rock soundtrack, pathetic special effects,
acting straight from a timber yard, non existent plot, naff characters, the
list of crimes this &quot;film&quot; has committed is endless!<br /><br />You really couldn't care less who lives or dies in this and the apparent
plot line about espionage and the theft of a virus in order to expose the
great Umbrella Corporation was soon forgotten in favour of more badly
scripted nonsense.<br /><br />The laser scene was quite nice though and the train was well done.  However
it also suffered by being packed to the rafters with dubious references and
in jokes to the video game of the same name which the average viewer of this
rubbish would not get and wonder why on earth it was included.<br /><br />Bargain bin fodder only - 2/10
