well, originally to me, this movie had cheese written all over it. I
expected to have a good time, but Res.Evil, managed to pull me in, make me
laugh, make me jump, and best of all, had me -and the rest of the theater-
cheerin our asses off. This film definitely does the popular game series
justice.<br /><br />as acting goes, milla jovovich is new queen of kickin ass (excludin
TV's
Buffy) she does great with what is her first REAL starring role. the rest
of
the cast, especially michelle rodriguez, handle themselves well and are
genuinely likable.<br /><br />the gore in this movie is pretty good and both the zombies and the
dobermans were terrific looking. Paul  Anderson does a great job writing
and
directing the film, bringing to life the best video game adaptation
ever!<br /><br />the ending was superb and i cannot wait 4 the sequel. Paul, crack ur
knuckles, u got some written to do!!!! 9.5/10
