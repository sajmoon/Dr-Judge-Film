I am probably the biggest critic when it comes to movies in the horror
genre. I hated the Scream movies, laughed at I Know What You Did Last
Summer, and was even bored by The Exorcist (even though i know that was
scary for the 70's). I was less than enthusiastic when my friend forced me
to go see this, because I had read the reviews (which, if you don't know,
are horrible). This movie starts off well and gets better in time. Part of
what makes this movie so good is the incredible sets and surprising special
effects, all on a budget of 40 million.  Also, it has a great ending that
leaves a doorway for a sequel. When you see this movie, leave your brain at
the door and just enjoy.
