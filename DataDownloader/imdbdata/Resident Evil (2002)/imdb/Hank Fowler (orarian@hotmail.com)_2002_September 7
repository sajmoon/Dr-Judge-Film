2002_September 7 

Having just rented the DVD I can easily recommend that after watching it,
play it with the director's commentary.  Commenting with him is the
producer, Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez.  I have never laughed so
hard while watching commentary before in my life.  There are gaps in the
commentary where no one says anything and then in a rush everyone starts
talking over one another, but that is part of what I liked about it.  You
could really tell that they were just saying what they really thought and
weren't scripted like some other commentaries seem to be.
