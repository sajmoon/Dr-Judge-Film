I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;m a closet fan of the series, but the first
installment doesn&#x27;t do as much for me as the later movies. My main
complaint is that the best part of the franchise, Milla Jovovich
(Alice), doesn&#x27;t get going until the last quarter of the movie. <br /><br />Until then, we&#x27;re subjected to boring build-up and the lamest, slowest
zombies since the first Resident Evil game. When Alice finally starts
doing her thing, the action picks up, but that doesn&#x27;t fully wash away
the boredom of watching the generic other characters being killed far
too slowly. <br /><br />There isn&#x27;t much cross-over between the movie and the game, besides a
few of the locations and the zombies. I don&#x27;t mind that so much, but I
wish Anderson would have added a few more cool moments and set-pieces
to Resident Evil, to balance out the boredom. He clearly didn&#x27;t aim to
make the movie scary, so it really needed to be action-packed, to keep
the viewer&#x27;s interest.
