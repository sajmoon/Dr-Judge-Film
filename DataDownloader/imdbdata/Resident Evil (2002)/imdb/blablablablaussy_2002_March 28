With all the recent crap cakes that hollywood has tricked people into
thinking is &quot;horror&quot; or even more disturbing: letting people forget what
decent horror films are about entirely, giving the impression that films
like &quot;Scream&quot; are actually half decent, let alone watchable at all, comes a
breath of fresh air. Resident Evil shows us what we have almost come to
forget: old school horror with a stylish flair enough to separate it from
the 80's horror films it selectively borrows from. I am not going to sit
around and complain it wasn't gory enough, although there definately could
have been more gore involved. I will say that it is definately a step in
the
right direction. Hopefully, if this film does well, we can hope to see more
bold attempts at anything with the slightest backbone other than crappy
90210 mock slasher films, that do nothing but slowly kill the horror genre
while it sleeps. Hopefully on that note, this would be more the awakening
of
a sleeping giant. Something that was missing in our cineplexes like it was
in our minds.. something that didn't have a guaranteed appeal and took
chances at reconnecting its audience with the main artery of why people go
to see a horror film, albeit one based on a video game.
