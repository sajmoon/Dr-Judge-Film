to think of this film as being a horror movie is a gross miscarriage of
justice. this is more an action-adventure movie than anything and has
nothing to with horror at all. on top of it, this isn't related in any
way to the excellent video game on which this movie is based on, other
than the t-virus and the undead featured in the game.<br /><br />Resident evil blatantly rips off everything from Cube to Warning Sign
to even Event Horizon and Alice in Wonderland.speaking of which, the
movie also references Stanley Kubrick's 2001: the homicidal computer
The Red Queen is a clear take on HAL.<br /><br />i tried to feel scared throughout the movie, but there was nothing to
make me feel scared.the zombies were rather pitiful, resembling
disease-ridden victims. the licker was really, really tacky. the
director should have substituted the licker for maybe the Tyrant from
the first game or the Leech Queen in Code:Veronica.<br /><br />despite its shortcomings, RE is a decent action movie that demands
repeated viewing.i got the DVD for Christmas, and i enjoyed watching
the movie much to my surprise.
