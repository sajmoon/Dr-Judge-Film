<br /><br />There's a difference between a movie and a popcorn movie. A regular movie
features decent acting and plot, and usually has some depth behind it. A
popcorn movie is just there for the sake of entertainment. There can be
good
popcorn movies (The Mummy) and there can be bad popcorn movies (Tomb
Raider). But, Resident Evil is somewhere in between.<br /><br />Deep underground is secret laboratory called The Hive. The Hive is owned by
the Umbrella Corporation, which controls almost 90% of things that the
public has in their house. Someone smashes and releases a deadly virus into
the air, which gets transported by the air conditioning. In order to stop
the virus from getting out, the computer (named The Red Queen) must close
off all exits and kill everyone in The Hive, because once you breathe in
the
virus, or get scratched or bitten by someone who carries it, you are
infected. A special military unit is unaware of the virus and assumes that
the computer malfunctioned and went homicidal. So they get their team
together and head down into The Hive. The team consists of Rain (Michelle
Rodriquez), Kaplan (Martin Crewes) and a few other people that have no
relevance to the story other than to meet a gruesome demise. This military
team takes down Alice (Milla Jovovich), Matt (Eric Mabius), and Spencer
Parks (James Purefoy) who will also help to destroy the Red Queen.<br /><br />When they're in The Hive, they find that all of those who died turned into
flesh-craving zombies and that the Red Queen was just doing what she had to
do. Now the team has to fight their way out. Oh yeah, and they only have
one
hour to do that in because the door leading out of The Hive will close
permanently trapping everyone down there. Plus, there's a giant zombie that
looks like a blob running around. Also, there's some Dobermans that look
like they were skinned alive.<br /><br />Resident Evil has a very strong first half hour. There's a somewhat
brilliant scene where half of the team are trapped in a room with lasers
that slice and dice them to bits if they do not get out of the way. The
middle of the movie is a jolt-a-minute ride that works only half of the
time. Then the ending is downright stupid. The zombies, also, are
frightening the first few times they appear, but then the fight scenes that
follow all have the same routine.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong, Resident Evil is a bad movie, but it's one of
those
movies that so bad it's good. As a regular movie, it's not worth anyone's
time. But as a popcorn movie, it works very well. So, order the large
popcorn with extra butter, sit down in the cushy theater seats and check
your brain at the door.---------6/10
