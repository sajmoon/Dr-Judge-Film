Yes, there is cheesy dialogue.  Yes, the CGI is obvious.  But none of that
matters once you see the film.  From the opening moments of the film, the
pace is set - fast and furious.  The action keeps coming and doesn't let
up.
Lots of cheap thrills (especially in the form of naked Milla *wink
wink*).
This is not a movie to have critical reservations about seeing.  Just go
and
have a good time.  Lots of laughs, violent bloody death, and hot zombie
action.  Fans of the video game should not be disappointed...I
wasn't.
