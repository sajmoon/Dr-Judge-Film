Milla Jovovich has a lot of talent, and has a very toned, HOT, AND SEXY
body. HOWEVER, even though Milla is a great actress, and she puts loads
of expression into her work, the story need much improvement.
Entertaining movie (sort of), a little boring. Some scenes are good
visual candy. Milla should be placed in way better movies though. She
deserves better directors than Alexander Witt and Paul W.S. Anderson.
Believe me, I could... no, a baby could write a better script! The only
reason I watched the movie was to see Milla move around that FINE bod!
The story sucks, but the acting is actually pretty good. I give it 5/10
because it has some really good ideas, but it just isn&#39;t worth watching
3 times. Watch Resident Evil 2. Much better that the first one, but
still, lacks originality. Hopefully Resident Evil 3 will turn out to be
the best!
