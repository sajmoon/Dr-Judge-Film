It started of like a rocket, moved along brilliantly for about 45 minutes,
and then slided back into mediocrity.<br /><br />I had seen previews of the movie and I had a hard time convincing myself
to
visit the theatre when it was finally released. Fair is fair, I have to
admit that I left the movies with a reasonably good feeling. The first
part
of the film was catching and it was well on its way to become my all time
favourite horror movie. Then it sort of went over the top. In trying to
keep
the attention of the audience they stretched the zombie action for to long
and the climax with the mutated monster was greatly over-done. The last
part
of the movie and the average acting performances of the main characters
will
probably keep me from buying the DVD.<br /><br />I would have liked a bit more suspense and imaginative horror. However the
die hard horror fan will probably have a very very good time.<br /><br />
