Just wondering if anyone knows: is the VHS version the only version
that shows &#39;Alice&#39; totally nude at the end of the movie? Did anyone see
it in the theater that remembers that part? Are there any DVD versions
that haven&#39;t super-imposed the sheets over her body (or maybe they just
re-shot the scene with her covered?) I suppose it was changed because
Mila later married the director, but I am greatly disappointed to see
the movie changed, especially since it had been released already with
the nude scene. I don&#39;t want to sound like it&#39;s the only reason I like
to re- watch the movie...but she is a very beautiful actress and it
made the fantasy of the movie more believable for me. Seeing it now
with the sheets on just takes me mentally right out of the fantasy and
think only about post-production modesty. Or maybe someone knows of a
digital version with her nude scene in it? Tell me if you do, please!
Thanks!
