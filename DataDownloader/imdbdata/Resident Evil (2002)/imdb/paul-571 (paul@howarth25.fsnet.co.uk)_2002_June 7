After being a long time fan of the computer game version of all 3 resident
evils this film, for me, has been longly anticipated.  Overall the film is
very good its easily worth spending and few dollars or pounds going to see
this film.  However for me i felt this film was too short for one, then
there wasn't a lot of blood considering this is a zombie film the
effects...
brilliant in some places not so in others to check out what I mean Just
look
at the scene with the playful head high laser defence system when it cuts
through that guys face and it falls into a hundred pieces (great stuff)
but
then you see the rather crappy CGI-monster that is the licker (for all the
people who didn't know). Then there's the plot which is non-existent maybe
it was so rushed i didn't notice it or maybe i was paying too much
attention
to Milla Jovovich (reason in its self to see the movie :).  If you think
this re-view is designed to put you off then its not its just that i feel
this film had so much potential and delivered less than i hoped for some
people this potential has been fulfilled for me its not.
When it come to the crunch i didn't pay to see this film but i would and
would go to see it again.
