Although I have never played the game itself, the trailers and hype got
the
best of me. So naturally, I had to see it....<br /><br />Although it wasn't exactly what I had expected, I can't say that I was
impressed. But then again, I wasn't disappointed either.  The acting was
...
adequate... the plot was a stretch, but, since I'm a fan of films such as
&quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;, I guess this plot was acceptable... :)<br /><br />The special effects were average (for the films of today). As with many
action films, the special effects did have their &quot;matrix moments&quot; but all
in
all, it was a &quot;fun&quot; film.<br /><br />The one thing that I did enjoy about the film... (from a staunch male
chauvinistic position) was 2 hours of watching Milla Jovovich. She may not
be the world's greatest actress, or have the world's best body, but DAMN,
she has a beauty about her. As the stories of ancient Troy said... &quot;A face
that launched a thousand ships&quot;....<br /><br />Overall, Resident Evil lacked the originality and punch that would make it
a
GREAT film, but for a few hours of entertainment, I think it did a pretty
good job.  If nothing else, it WAS FUN!<br /><br />
