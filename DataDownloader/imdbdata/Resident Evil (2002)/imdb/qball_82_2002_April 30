When are those stupid Hollywood producers just gonna learn, videogames DO
NOT translate to the big screen...very well!  It's been proven countless
times, but they just don't get it...and here we have yet another one..<br /><br />That said, Resident Evil wasn't as big a stinker as some game-to-movie
adaptions that I can recall (Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, anyone?).  But
there's still plenty to pick on...<br /><br />Resident Evil tries really hard to be slick and stylish (like Tomb Raider),
but for the most part it falls flat on its face and fails miserably.  As
one
would probably expect, the story takes a backseat (hell, it's not even in
the car), and gives way to some hardcore action, lotsa gore, zombies, a
mysterious genetic research laboratory, a hella sexy chick in some wicked
designer clothes who can sure kick butt, and one macho chick with some big
'tude...and a big gun.  That about sums it all up.<br /><br />Oh, and I wanna also say that the special effects absolutely
sucked.<br /><br />It could have been better, it could have been worse. As far as
videogame-movies go, Resident Evil didn't quite make the grade, in my
books.
If you're looking for substance (which I doubt you are, given that you are
reading this review), look elsewhere.  But if you want all of the above,
maybe you should check it out.<br /><br />
