Went into this movie not knowing what to expect, when I orignally saw the
trailer I was extremely disappointed with how the film looked, but after
seeing the commercial on tv a few times, I realized it may have potential,
but due to the fact that it was a video game movie, I still kept the
expectations low, (even thought it was done by the same guy who did Mortal
Kombat which is an awesome movie).  The movie started off a little slow,
but
picked up pretty quick, Milla Jovovich ruled, Michelle rodriguez played her
&quot;tough chic&quot; role, but pulled it off, I kind of wanted a little more out of
Eric Mabius, I think he has potential as an actor but all and all the
acting
was pretty good for this kind of flik.  The biggest fear I had going into
this movie was that I didn't think it would stick to the same formula as
the
games, but it did, almost to a key.  The movie's score was done by Mr.
Marilyn Manson which was excellent, added extra creepiness to the
atmosphere.  All and all I really enjoyed this movie, and I would recommend
it to fans of the games and to anyone looking for a wild
ride.
10/10
