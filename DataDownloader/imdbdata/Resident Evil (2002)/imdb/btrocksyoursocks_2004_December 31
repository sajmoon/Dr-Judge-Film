RESIDENT EVIL (2002) cast: Milla Jovovich, Eric Mabius, Michelle
Rodriguez, James Purefoy.<br /><br />plot: Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up in her mansion with total amnesia
only to be taken down to a secret underground laboratory called &quot;The
Hive&quot; which is part of the Umbrella Corporation, which she is
supposedly an employee of. She goes down with a group of paramilitary
commandos including Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) and Matt (Eric Mabius),
in order to shut down The Hive and protect the world from the spreading
T-Virus, which turns people into the walking dead. Alice must fight for
her life along with the others to battle zombies, mutant dogs, and
strange creatures called &quot;Lickers&quot;.<br /><br />the good: Having never played the famous videogames, I went into this
movie with an open-mind not expecting it to be like, or not like, the
videogames. I was basically expecting some crazy zombie action fun! And
that's exactly what I got! Lots of action, zombies and more types of
fun! Alice is a very interesting character, someone who was never in
the games and is unwillingly brought into a war. This also has a very
claustrophobic setting, in the laboratory, they're locked in and can't
escape until the place is shutdown. It was also a nice introduction to
the trilogy and basically set the standard.<br /><br />the bad: I didn't get much of the characters as I should have. Alice
and Matt were cool, and so was Rain but she was basically just like all
of Rodriguez's roles.<br /><br />All the other commandos all blended together and I could barely tell
them apart.<br /><br />8/10
