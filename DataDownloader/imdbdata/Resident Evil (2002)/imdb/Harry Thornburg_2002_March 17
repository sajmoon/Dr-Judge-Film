I have been waiting for this movie to be released for along time now.  As
I
went to the opening of Resident Evil I was worried that the film would not
equal my expectations.The film surprised me by being better than expected.
Before going to see this film I want you to ask yourself these questions.
Is
this happening below my city? Can this kind of research actually be going
on
right now? Would the military and the goverment try to create the ultimate
bio weapon? If this won't send chills down your spine then your probably
already dead! Enjoy the movie and pray for your salvation.
