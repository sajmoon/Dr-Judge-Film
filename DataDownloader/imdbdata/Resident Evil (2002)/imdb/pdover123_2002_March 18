I just went to see this movie and it was ok...it had it's moments. Some
parts were truly great if they didn't have to be edited. Which I don't
understand because Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead were a hell of a lot
more gorier than this film...and actually a lot better. While I thought this
movie was great it could have been truly horrifying. Milla was awesome...but
she seemed kinda lost or maybe it was supposed to look that way. But anyway
if you want an action packed ride with a few scares thrown in this one is
for you. If you are a gorehound then you will be disappointed. I hope that
when the DVD comes out they restore some of the cut scenes. I think in all
honesty that the nudity near the end is actually worse than the violence but
hey I'm not complaining.
