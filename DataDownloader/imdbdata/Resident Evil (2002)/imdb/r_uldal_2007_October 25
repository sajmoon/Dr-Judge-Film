Yeah, well when you think about it, making a movie from a video game
that primarily is a shoot-the-baddie&#39;s game there will be some big
holes in the storyline and the plot. This is actually a movie that i
had left twice before finally finishing it. <br /><br />When thats said i think the storyline and the plot is great, seen from
the perspective that there wasn&#39;t enough of this from the game to make
a movie with. But seen in the present of other movies in this genre or
other movies that has been made from videogames, this one really sucks.
Even if you are a huge fan of the games, this movie will ultimately
make you suffer.<br /><br />The effects: The effects are on some occasions wildly and hugely
overestimated. In some scenes a 45&#39; can blast a hole in a building big
enough to drive a lorry into the building, and in other scenes the
exact same 45&#39; can be used several times on a Zombie character and
almost leave no marks.. In some scenes you see costumes that could be
taken from &quot;lord of the rings&quot; and in other scenes they almost fall off
the stuntmen wearing them!! Especially in one scene where some of a
chase is in slowmotion you can see that everything on that
actor/stuntman that are a part of his / her outfit is moving and
shaking. <br /><br />If you like the genre of movies made from videogames and you want to
see this one, i wont disencourage you. You&#39;ll find out for yourself. If
you want to see some other movies made from videogames &quot;DOOM&quot; is much
much better, even though that one isn&#39;t great either.
