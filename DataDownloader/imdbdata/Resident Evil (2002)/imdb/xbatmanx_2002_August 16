Video game makers are mostly influenced by classic stories to give their
games shape.  So, it's no wonder that RESIDENT EVIL has lots of hints to and
ideas taken from for example Romero's DAY OF THE DEAD.  I would even dare to
mention that there wouldn't be a RESIDENT EVIL if Romero didn't make his
zombie trilogy!  But also new films are recognized in some scenes, like for
example the scene with the lazer beams is totally taken from THE CUBE (which
was pretty good by the way).
RE has a bit more action over the whole line, but doesn't have the
psychology that goes on in Romero films, neither does it create a tension or
a feel with the characters.  It also doesn't have the gore that zombie films
supposed to have.  The effects are smooth, yet there's not much blood
spilled for a zombie flick.  Best example from this is the first scene in
the elevator: we don't see her head fall off.  
Through the whole movie you are waiting for something to come, they try to
build up tension and you are left behind with nothing. <br /><br />The plot (thank you Romero) tries to be high-tech, but it's obvious it's
just dragged into the film for little reason, but to give us a falls feeling
of intelligent action.  
RESIDENT EVIL was a total let down and was even worse then I expected.  And
then I'm not even talking about the killer bunny...<br /><br />--- FOR GAMERS ONLY ---
