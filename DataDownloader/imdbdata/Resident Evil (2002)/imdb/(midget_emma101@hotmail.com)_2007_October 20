Resident evil is one of those movies that are not good and not bad at
the same time.<br /><br />It had a bit of the games, Romero flicks and the Bourne movies rolled
into one movie.<br /><br />This one is much more believable then the 2nd movie and might make you
jump a little bit if it is your first time watching it and the sound is
way up.<br /><br />Fans of the games will either like the movie or not like the movie. It
may have the fans saying they should have put this zombie in the movie
or that character.<br /><br />The zombies looked great with chunks of there faces or bits of there
neck missing.<br /><br />This Sci-Fi horror movie is not bad and is one for the fans of the
games and people who like a zombie movie. If you see this movie you
must see the next 2 movies next.<br /><br />This movie is entertaining and a great popcorn movie that i recommend
to those people who want a movie that are looking for a great Sci Fi
movie. This a OK movie that has a few characters and monsters thrown in
from the games. Go watch this but don&#39;t expect this to be better then
28 days later or dawn of the dead.<br /><br />6/10
