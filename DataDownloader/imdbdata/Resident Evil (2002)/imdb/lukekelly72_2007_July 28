I&#39;d give this -10, it&#39;s the most painful and tedious pile of excrement
to ever cross my path.<br /><br />They ignored every good feature that the video-game had to offer, and
just took the name and made an unrelated movie.<br /><br />It&#39;s complete self-indulgent pap, with the most terrible ear splitting
tinny, thrash metal, chode, music I&#39;ve ever heard.<br /><br />Y&#39;know that gimp (we all know one), who deliberately walks with a limp
and wears his black leather jacket and has a emo hairdoo, well this is
what he&#39;s watching every night as he smears his adolescent body-grease
over his badly-played guitar.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie that people are getting cheated by every
weekend, and the studio happily makes their money, they must be
laughing all the way to the bank. I believe that everyone involved in
&quot;creating&quot; this cheap-shot of a movie sincerely hates cinema.<br /><br />W.S.Anderson, you make the world a worse place.
