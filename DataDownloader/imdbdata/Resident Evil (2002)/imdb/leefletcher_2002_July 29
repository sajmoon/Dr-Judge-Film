Totally stylish remake of the zombie classics. Excellent special effects,
gorgeous Milla Jovovich, perfect, expertly directed musical score... and
the
storyline is actually pretty good too!<br /><br />Videogame to film adaptations are always infamously bad, but this one sets
the standard for all to come. You can liken it to a gory, super-tense
horror
version of the Matrix.<br /><br />Awesome.
