As a fan of the horror genre and of the Resident Evil video game series I
was looking forward to the theatrical adaption. However after viewing the
movie I can only mourn what could have been. The majority of the movie is
seen without the presence of any monsters and the ones that show up are few
in number. One Licker a single pack of Cerberus zombie dogs and a few dozen
Zombies, does little to impress this viewer. There is little character
development and the performances themselves are hardly commendable. As for
the amount of gore or in this case the lack there of it greatly hinders the
movie itself. For an R rated horror movie this film had a serious lack in
carnage and bloodshed. And if the title of Resident Evil is to be used the
movie using it needs to have a certain quotient of violence and gore this
film does not. In the end we have a movie with a big budget and fancy
special effects that fail to cover up the fact that this is one lightweight
horror movie. Not recomended at all
