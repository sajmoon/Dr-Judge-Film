Going into this movie I had high expectations on this film, being a fan
of the game for which it was named. Now if you don't know the game this
is a 'okay' if somewhat lackluster Zombie film, After all it's standard
fair for a movie of it's type.My problems with it stems from the fact
this movie has NOTHING to do with it's source material but name alone.
It felt like it was written by someone that didn't even read the crib
sheets for the Resident Evil Game but ONLY skimmed them(briefly).That
is my biggest complaint, it seems standard fair these days in Hollywood
to slap on a name recognition titles on to movies with little to do
with the source material. That's my complaint to the point, if this
film had been more faithful to it's title (No Tyrant, Mansion, Jill,
Chris or ANY characters from the game used or referenced to in the
slightest.)I might have enjoyed it more.But as it stands it's at best a
sub par overrated zombie film with a misplaced title. Resident Evil,
Where?
