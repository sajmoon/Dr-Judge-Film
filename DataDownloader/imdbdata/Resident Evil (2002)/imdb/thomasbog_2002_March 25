First of all, I heard that the Video Game &quot;Resident Evil&quot; get its own
Movie,
I was very scared. The Adaption from Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat were
very poor. The Movie got bad Rates, too. But than I saw Resident Evil in
the
Cinema and I am still suprised. The Zombies, Dog`s  etc. lookes very great
and the Movie it self is good too und has many Shock Scenes`s. I am going
to
look the Movie again.
And I am very proud that this is a 100 % GERMAN Movie and it is filmed in
Berlin, Germany, where I come from. Yeah
Constantin Film Rulez !<br /><br />Be ready for Part II:
Resident Evil Nemesis !!!
