I expected to enjoy this one... but not as much as I did. It is extremely
VIOLENT and overtly brutal. Any parent bringing their kids to this should
be
put in jail ;)
I've not played the game... but might look into it now.<br /><br />The FX were pretty sweet, but weren't the main focus. The main focus, as
it
appeared to me, was a First Person Shooter (FPS) in REAL life. While
watching, I kept thinking about how I was feeling the same sensations as
when I played an intense gaming session. The game Thief had me nervous at
many corners, this movie did that too. But the story was still great. No
more far fetched than any other piece of fiction based on fears of genetic
testing. :)<br /><br />I'm giving it an 8/10
