I have played and beaten most of the resident evil games, and when i saw
the
movie i thought it was great! The only thing about it was that there
wasn't
alot of graphic scenes, which is ok...But i mean it is a zombie type of
movie. Also it had really nothing to do with the games at all, besides the
appearance of stars members and the mansion. All in all though it was a
very
good action packed movie that takes place before the first resident evil
video game, and it does a good job in the new plot line to :
