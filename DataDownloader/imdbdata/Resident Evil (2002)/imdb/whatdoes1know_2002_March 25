If you want to see splatter, watch Ichi the Killer. If you want to see tasty
bits and pieces of Milla Jojovich, you've chosen the right movie. Never mind
that the zombies are only a little scarier than feudal Japanese married
women. Never mind you are aware that it's the loud high-pitched score that
scares you and not the movie. This is a nice collection of cliche, but
well-done scenes using a tasty color palette.
