I don't know what everyones complaining about, half the comments are going
on about how this movie isn't gory enough, had crappy special effects, bad
acting, no plot, etc...<br /><br />Well i personally think that a movie doesn't need over the top gore to be
good. The movie also had good special effects, as far as the licker goes
how
can you say that it didn't have good special effects?!?! it doesn't exist
in
real life so how do you know that it's not really supposed to look like
that. The acting wasn't amazing but wasn't horrible either, and the plot
was
excellent. The movie followed the game very well. My only complaint was
the
lack of zombies, dogs, and other creatures. In conclusion i think that
this
movie was pretty good, anyone who has played the game should definitely
watch this.
