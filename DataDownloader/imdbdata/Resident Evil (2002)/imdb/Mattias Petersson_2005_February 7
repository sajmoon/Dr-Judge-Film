I'm no fan of the Resident Evil video games. I have played them but i
found them to be quite tedious and slow. Not bad, but nothing that
didn't feel like &quot;Alone in the dark&quot; hadn't already done it years ago
on the Amiga.<br /><br />The research complex called &quot;The Hive&quot; is buried deep under ground. Now
a virus have gotten loose there that has caused the hive to close
itself. A special military unit is going in to investigate.<br /><br />I was of course skeptical when i saw who directed this movie. The
Antichrist of b-action Paul W.S. Anderson. And here he does it again,
the same thing he almost always does. Turns the movie into crap. And
there are several reasons for this.<br /><br />First of all Milla Jovovich is completely wrong in the hero part. Going
to war in a mini skirt is ridiculous to begin with, and it just becomes
even worse from there. The cinematography is surprisingly OK as are
most of the special effects. But the action scenes completely lack any
kind of tension or pulse. It's just people firing weapons while REALLY
loud heavy metal music is playing, but there is no real excitement.
This is typical of Paul W.S. Andersons movies though. The lack of any
pulse in the action scenes. Seldom have so many fired bullets and so
much fighting felt so incredibly slow.<br /><br />So why watch this? Well it's not recommended. I don't know how it
compares with the video games as i don't know the games well enough.
But i do know that standing on it's own this is an inferior action
movie. There are a few tolerable scenes and a couple of moments that
lift this a bit above the lowest mark. But in the end you can do
something better with your time. I rate this 3/10.
