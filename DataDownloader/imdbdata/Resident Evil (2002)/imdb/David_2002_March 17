I had little knowledge of the movie before I saw it, but
when I did it was amazing.  Although not knowing about
the
movie made the first 10 minutes awkward veiwing as I didn't
know what was going on.  After that they provided a nice
up to date explaination as to what was happening for the
unenlightened viewer.  Then the rollar coaster ride started
and
never stopped!!!  Excellent suspense and gory scenes and
often NOT predictable were the highlights of the film. <br /><br />I really enjoyed the movie and would recomend it to anyone
who
is not squeemish:)
