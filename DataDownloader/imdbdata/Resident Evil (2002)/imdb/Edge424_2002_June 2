A great adaptation of the video game putting about 8 survivors from the
unrelenting T-virus, that turns humans into zombies trying to escape from
the laboratory in which it was created.  This movie had great makeup for the
zombies, and a great action packed sequence of events throughout the entire
movie although the plot outlined could have used some work the gore effects
in the movie did well and the survivors did a great job working together to
create a suspenseful movie that will keep you wondering whats gonna happen
next.  This is another movie that I will say if you haven't seen it i
would.<br /><br />On a scale of 1-10 i give this movie a 7
