&quot;Resident Evil&quot; was more intelligent than &quot;Aliens,&quot; and the twist and turn
in the movie was good.  I'm not a fan of slasher/horror, and living dead
movies, but I eventually settled into the movie with its scientific sounding
rationale gunk.  I was terrified (although not scared, as if there's a
difference).  I particularly liked how compassionate some of the scenes
were, while the beginning indiscriminate killing was quite effective in
setting the tone for the rest of the movie.<br /><br />It's really difficult to describe what it was about &quot;Resident Evil&quot; that
made it stand out above the usual blood and gore movies.  The touch of
humanity, the computer logic, the seriousness of the military discipline? 
Somehow, all the parts seemed to work together.  Milla as an actress did a
great job with a number of different portraits of human behaviors and
emotions.  The script was a notch above the usual cut and slash.  Somehow
the ending even seemed apt and complete creating both the typical uneasy
shucks reaction but at the same time yeah ok, I understand, a decent ending
- serves you right.
