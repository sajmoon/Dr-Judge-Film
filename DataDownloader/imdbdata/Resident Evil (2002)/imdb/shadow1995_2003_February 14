2003_February 14 

Don't get me wrong; I am a big fan of video games and video game inspired
movies.  In fact I believe that story line behind Video Game Half-Life
can
challenge and beat most of the contemporary sci-fi movies. But anyways -
Resident Evil - such an interesting set-up and start of the story.<br /><br />But 15 minutes in, I started to realize that director just didn't have
enough to use the full potential of the set-up and what could have been
done
since the story is independent from VG.  It is highly predictable; too
much
pointless gore.  The effects are surprisingly good, although some current
video games can match them.  For those who want real scare, watch the
creature from room 237 (Shining)- it makes all the monsters in that movie
by
appearance and surprise look like teletubbies.
Acting is bad, Shwarzengger's tm 1-liners and CLICHE, CLICHE, CLICHE.  I
would give a cookie to a director to some scenes with Mila Jonovich at
start
and very end of the movies, they are reminiscent ... scrap that - they
are a
failed attempt on actually introducing some symbolism and character
development in the movie - thru all pointless &quot;hidden&quot; nudity obviously
aiming at 13 year old boys like the rest of the movie - too bad they
forgot
that rating of this movie is R  :(
