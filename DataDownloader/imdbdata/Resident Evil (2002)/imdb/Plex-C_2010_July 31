I saw the trailer for Afterlife and i got to thinking, &#x22;People need to
know how whether this series is good or not.&#x22; So here&#x27;s my opinion. I
think the Resident Evil movies are a waste of money and time. My
opinion is based on mainly the relation of the Video Game series, yes
the movies are based on a video game series, as well as the movie
itself. Well the story is completely messed up, the story has next to
nothing to do with the games. They took the games titles as well as the
names of some of the characters, without successfully portraying them
properly, other than that, they took the name of the town, and that&#x27;s
pretty much it. <br /><br />There was no hive in the games, and Alice (The protagonist of the
films) isn&#x27;t even from the games! They got the virus all wrong and
never got anywhere close to the plot of the games. Some people may say
that, &#x22;Both the games and the movies are about a Zombie apocalypse,
they got the story right.&#x22; Wrong, The story is much deeper than that.
If the movies were not named after the games, i would have passed of
the things they actually took from the games as simple allusions. <br /><br />If you don&#x27;t play the games, you might actually enjoy the films, the
plot may be a little messed up and simple, but the action is OK and i
can&#x27;t complain too much about the acting. With relation to the games, i
give it a 1/10, without 6.3/10. If your curios about the real storyline
of the games, please watch a retrospective. I&#x27;m sorry if i come off as
rude or biased, but it&#x27;s hard for someone who loves the games so much.
Peace to you all.
