This story of the walking dead in a secret government base is very
disappointing. <br /><br />In all honesty I expected to despise this film and then was shocked
when the first half hour leading up to the zombies, was a tight, scary
horror film of the highest order.<br /><br />And then the zombies show up and it all falls into the toilet. The
problem with this movie is that the monsters are so badly acted and so
awful looking it takes away from any tension because you are laughing
at them. Such is the problem with most post-Dawn of the Dead films, the
people playing zombies over act and destroy the mood. Chalk it up to
awful direction, or non direction of the crowds of zombies.<br /><br />If you can get past the laughter this is a good film. Many people I've
told about the laughable monsters, liked the film when they saw it
themselves, I on the other hand can't be as forgiving because I loved
the opening that much.<br /><br />Try it, but expect to laugh more than you scream.<br /><br />5 out of 10 (purely because of the zombie, the rest is pretty good)
