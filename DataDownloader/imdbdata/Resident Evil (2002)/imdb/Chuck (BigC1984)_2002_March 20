Personally I thought the movie was great. Even though they changed alot
of
things from the first game. I thought the plot needed a little more added
to
it, but other than that, everything looked real. I've read quite a few
reviews on how this was nothing like the game, well that's what I loved
most
of all, it kept me on the edge of my seat. If the movie was exactly like
the
game, I wouldn't have gone and seen it ( Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge RE
fan). So if you are a RE fan, go see the movie. I give it 4.5 out of 5
stars.
