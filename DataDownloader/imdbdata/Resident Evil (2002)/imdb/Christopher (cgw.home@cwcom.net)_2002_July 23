To start with
1,  I hate horror movies
2, I really do. Seen too many bad horror films
3, I play games loads so this film was destined to fall
4, This film rocks! ????<br /><br />That over with, I am lucky enough to live five mins walk from a 15
screen cinema. I have watched every film I can think of since I
moved here two years ago. So much so that when my best friend
wanted to see this film I pointed to reviews in the uk press about
how bad the film is. I have  completed all the games and he has
not so I win, well maybe not. I was sooooo bored that he paid for
my ticket. Sat in my seat I was immediately glad that I had not
bought any popcorn or drinks as I jumped out of my seat too many
times to count. As a person who has spent years laughing at
Freddy and Jason this is a great achievement.
This film appeals to the people who were angry at tomb raider and
recently scooby doo for sucking bad. Mainly because it shines
above all of them. For those who have not played the game, You
are in a hopeless situation and the only way to win is to kill
everything that moves  and guess what? that is what this film does
and does very very well. If  you want a script go watch a beautiful
mind, If you want zombies, lasers and more fake blood than a
B-movie vampire flik then I urge you to see this. One of the best
endings to a film  ever!. A little like the project IGI ending for
computer buffs.
Final destination with allot more balls.
I want nemesis bad!
