Usually with action movies people come out of the movie theater very
excited
wait to tell their friend about how great the movie is, but this movie was
the best action horror out of 2002. It makes you wanting more, Milla
Jovanovich did a great performance and the movie is not predictable that's
what makes it even better. it's not cheesy too like some for an example
not
all the stars make it out alive. So I got to say is if you like gore
action
SCI-fi you will love resident evil I give this movie a
8/10
