Having played all the games, I watched the movie with anticipation.  No
it
doesn't follow the same script, but that's a good thing else it would
have
been a bit dull knowing what was about to happen.  Yes the main
characters
have changed, but that aside all I can say is Oh My God!  This movie is
not
just a gore fest; it's a brilliant one.  The actors were good (not
amazing
got to admit) the plot line is fun and unlike most other game to movie
conversions, this one is good.  If you want a true to script game to
movie
film go and watch Tomb Raider and when you realise just how crap that is,
you will understand why this was changed.  Milla Jovovich is cool and yet
still believable (golden rule in making a film) the special effects were
well done (2nd golden rule, unlike {spit} Spiderman) and it includes
slicing, dicing and liquidising of sub characters - about time someone
had
the balls to do it.  The end result was more fun than a watching a live
frog
in a blender.  If you like to watch gratuitous violence thats done in a
fun
fashion kind of way then there is no better, Can't wait for the sequel.
Ignore the bitching and go and watch it to make you own mind up, you
never
know you may be pleasantly surprised.
