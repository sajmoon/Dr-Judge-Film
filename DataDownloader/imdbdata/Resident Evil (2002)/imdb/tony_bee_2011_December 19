The only reason I can think of giving this film a rating of 2/10, is
that number 2 was even worse. Just focusing on this one, the story is
so basic and weak, the characters are rubbish, the special affects, the
zombie&#x27;s, the action were abysmal. The idea of the character &#x27;Alice&#x27;
was useless, if you played the game you would know their&#x27;s no character
named &#x27;Alice&#x27;, and there&#x27;s no need for &#x27;Alice&#x27; as their were several
characters they could of used from the game. Besides Michelle Rodriguez
the acting was below average in fact the only thing worse, was the
directing. Paul W.S.Anderson my nominee for worse director. I can&#x27;t
actually believe the studio&#x27;s have allowed for further instalments of
this shocking movie, which is supposedly based on the &#x27;Resident Evil
games&#x27;.
