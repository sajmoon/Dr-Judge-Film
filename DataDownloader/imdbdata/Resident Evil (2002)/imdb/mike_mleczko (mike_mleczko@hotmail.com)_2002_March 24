I thought Hollow Man was bad.  This movie goes way beyond in terms of
tasteless.  If you just want to see zombies try to eat people without a
really good sense of story or character development, this movie is for you.<br /><br />For those with tastes that go beyond a grade school written script, I
suggest you steer clear of this wreck.  Very little sense of what causes
zombies to need to &quot;feed&quot; as they do or even why they really
exist.
I won't even comment further on specifics of the 'eh-hem' &quot;plot&quot;.  In
general the reasons for why things happen are very poorly explained (in
terms of the creation of the problems).
The movie even goes as far as to assume a sequel is a given...<br /><br />Presuming  a great deal and delivering nothing but the mindless violence
you
get a B horror flick, this movie is a horrible insult to the intelligence
of
anyone who wants their disbelief suspended.
