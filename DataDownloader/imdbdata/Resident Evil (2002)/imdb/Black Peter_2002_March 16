Saw Resident Evil at the theater last night--after a year in anticipation,
I
was not disappointed!!!  Milla Jovovich was awesome, the special effects
were great, and it wasn't lacking in plot like Tomb Raider.<br /><br />If you want to see an action packed movie that will keep you on the edge of
your seat (except when it makes you jump), then you have to see this
film!!!!
