This is a &quot;must see&quot; for anyone who considers themself a &quot;gamer&quot;
(especialy RE fans). Most games make horrible movies, this one finally
got it right (well, to be fair, the Finally Fantasy movie was good
also). Plenty of suspense, a few &quot;jumps&quot;, and a lot of things that
people will recognize from the game.<br /><br />As long as you realize this is a live interpretation of the game
universe, you should really enjoy it. Those who aren't fans of the
game, may not like it as much as it's only an &quot;ok&quot; action/horror flick.
(I wouldn't classify it as horror, but that's because I watch a lot of
horror, and this just isn't scary.)<br /><br />Oh, and I couldn't say enough good things about the soundtrack.
