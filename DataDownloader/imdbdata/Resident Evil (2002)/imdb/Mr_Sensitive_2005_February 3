This is probably the best game adaptation movie I have ever seen. Tell
the truth I can't see why so many people did give a pretty negative
review about this movie. But after you watch it for yourself you would
find that it is not like the game (I love the game) but there a lot of
resemblance in it between the two. After all it can't be exactly like
the game.<br /><br />I think the movie is pretty cool from the very start, though you might
not know what going on in the first but you will, later. The action
sequence that you will see is great and very much convincing and even
though the casting is pretty weird it not that bad at all.<br /><br />I think it is a very good sci-fi movie that should not be missed.<br /><br />Rating: 7/10 (Grade: B-)
