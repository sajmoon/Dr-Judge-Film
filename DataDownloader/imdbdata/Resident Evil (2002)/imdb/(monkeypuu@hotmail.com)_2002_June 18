being a Big fan of all the games and clocked all but about 2 i am VERY
dissapointed in this movie.
I have been wating for this movie for a good 3 or 4 years and i am p***ed
off with the final results.
This is nothing like the game and the dialogue is crap sure there is some
good special effects but the zombies suck. Theay could have made this
movie
sooo much better if theay had made exatly like the first game it would be
perfact because the story line in that is 10 times better.
I give this movie 1 out of 10 it sucks.<br /><br />As i said this is BULLSH!T
