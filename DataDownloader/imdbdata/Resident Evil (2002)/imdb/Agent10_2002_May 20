While never having played the 
games, the movie was rather 
interesting. Granted, the acting 
wasn't exactly something to write 
home about, the music, cinematography 
and the lighting proved to give this film 
a boost. The production value was 
also exceptional, allowing the effects 
to be legitimate as opposed to being 
some hokie paint on CGI. I've also 
wondered, Why does Milla Jovovich 
show her breasts in every movie and 
photo shoot she is in? Gets kind of 
dull after a while. Anyway, I will state 
this, the ending proved to be one of 
the finest constructed moments in sci-fi history.
