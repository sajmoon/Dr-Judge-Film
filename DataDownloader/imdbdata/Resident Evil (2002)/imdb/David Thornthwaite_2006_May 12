Not having played the games I wasn&#39;t too bothered about the loyalty, or
lack thereof, to the source material. Normally I feel right at home in
anything featuring evil corporations and terrible mistakes (reminds me
of my employment history I suppose), but this didn&#39;t do a lot for me.
Like most zombie movies it&#39;s an action-horror but, while the action is
reasonable enough, the horror aspect lets the film down badly. Horror,
afterall isn&#39;t just about plain old fear. At its most effective it
captures the senses in ghoulish fascination, while hitting the mind
with such a terrible concept that it reels off in revolt. When done
well zombies, in their relentless overwhelming of society, can cause
outright despair. Otherwise they&#39;re just slow, weak and stupid, poor
opponents for an action heroine. MJ fans by all means enjoy yourselves,
but there are better action films and far better horror films.
