In my Opinion everyone should have known that the movie was not going
to be like the game. Every person who has played the games and watched
the movie should know that the two are completely different. also I
think the movie was better because you get to watch the story unfold
instead of playing. Then again I am not a very big game freak, but
still. The movie was one of the most interesting I've seen. yet the
film maker seemed to think it was a good idea to have Alice in a tight
red dress all the way through.... it was very strange, but I should say
I would admire anybody who could stand wearing that dress and those
shoes and still kick those zombies ass. :) I hope they make a resident
evil three in fact! =)
