Not that that's a bad thing.  Although I generally like more substantial
fare, sometimes it's nice to have a fun movie come along.  Unlike so many
other action/thriller movies out there that pretend to be so much more
than
they actually are, this one makes no attempt to try to carry a meaningful
plot or intelligent dialogue.  It's pure escapism, and it's fun to
watch.<br /><br />I have to hand it to the creative team behind this one, as it cooks up new
and creative ways to kill people.  But the violence isn't as mindless as
the
rest of the movie -- there's still that sense of shock and horror when
someone gets killed.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and get ready for the sequel -- this one's not even subtle about
setting up for Resident Evil II - Escape from Racoon City.
