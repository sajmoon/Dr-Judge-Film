people had been bad-mouthing this movie before it was even released. it
came
out today, i saw it, and i thought it kicked a lot of ass. REALLY. years
ago, director george romero was attatched to direct this film, but either
he
couldn't get it together or his script wasn't good enough and they decided
not to go with him as director. as a longtime horror/zombie movie fan, let
me just say that romero already put his stamp on material like this when
he
made DAY OF THE DEAD in the 80s (which has a lot in common with RESIDENT
EVIL in terms of setting, atmosphere, characters, plot, and general tome)
and there'd be no point in him directing this type of film again. that
said,
i think director paul anderson has done an incredible job directing this
movie! it is tense, scary, unrelenting, and moves along at a perfect pace.
his previous film SOLDIER (with kurt russell) is highly underrated, you
should check it out. milla jovovich and michelle rodriguez are both
wonderful in RESIDENT as well, i liked them both quite a bit. this is the
first movie based on a video game that i actually enjoyed, and i hope it
gets a sequel fast. my only complaint is the computer-generated effects,
which get ridiculously overused (come on, zombies don't need CGI makeup,
just call tom savini). perhaps with more $$$ this can be remedied if they
make another...and anyone who sees this &amp; likes it will be begging for
part
