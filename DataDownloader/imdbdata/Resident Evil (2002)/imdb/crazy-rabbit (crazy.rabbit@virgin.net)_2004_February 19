2004_February 19 

This is a film which, on the surface, appears no more than a by the
numbers
action/adventure version of a popular computer game but it is given extra
depth by a director with a neat idea lodged in his head and a like minded
producer.
Extra depth may not be the correct turn of phrase as the sub-text of
Resident Evil has little or nothing to do with the plot line and
characters
involved in the story line and situations presented to the
fore.
Taken at face value Resident Evil is an enjoyable but highly derivative
zombie movie that seems slightly hampered by a 15 certificate and a poorly
realised soundtrack.
On the subject of the derision I can offer the fact that upon drawing up
the character of Rain the script writers appears to have picked up his
brightly coloured safety-scissors and Pritt-stick and clumsily cut and
pasted in Vasquez from Aliens. Others are as - if not more - two
dimensional
to the extent that the ambiguous Main frame computer known as the Red
Queen
(rendered first as a hologram and later as simply a voice) is the most
interesting character in the film. There is also a scene that confuses me
greatly that involves a corridor and lasers. The Director and
cinematographer state proudly that the lighting and style of this scene is
a
subtle homage to 2001. Very well gentlemen but what they fail to mention
is
that the ENTIRE sequence is ripped wholly from the beginning of The Cube!
A
conscious double bluff perhaps?
The action sometimes seems disjointed. Characters appear in different
places in adjacent scenes with no explanation as to how they travelled
between them. In one glaring example two characters are alone in a room
talking quietly at the end of one scene and at the very beginning of the
very next scene they are depicted running full pelt down a corridor chased
by hordes of hungry zombies.
The special effects, especially Zombies, are very well realised and I
reject the arguments that they are Romero rip-offs. The argument goes that
because these zombies are wearing suits and other normal clothes that they
MUST have been stolen from Dawn of the Dead. My argument goes that the
film
takes place in an office building, what do you expect them to wear? Shell
suits?
The soundtrack made the mistake of  ditching the superb industrial sounds
of a Clint Mansell score in favor of the childish and cynically noisy
songs
of the likes of Korn and Marilyn Manson.
There is in fact so little in the film to tax the brain that you cannot
help
but enjoy it on purely popcorn level as you would The Fast and The Furious
or Erazer. You also cannot help but wonder, when you know the secret of
the
film, if this no-brain exterior isn't just a clever smoke screen, a
fa&ccedil;ade,
a two-way mirror that the audience is on the wrong side
of.
Resident Evil is a virtual vehicle for massive succession of Alice and
Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass references. I will not list, or
attempt to list, all these references and asides here but they are many.
From the virtually unnoticeable: Some illustrations on the face of a
clock.
To the down right blatant: The Red Queen character or the central
character
being named Alice (Despite NEVER being referred to by her name in the
course
of the film.)
Nearly all of these cameos are well realised and never seem forced; they
are a fascinating aside to the film and lend it an air of intelligence and
thought that are in no way apparent in the body of the
piece.
My favourites among them include a secret entrance behind a mirror, the
way
Alice first fall asleep and much later wakes up again on a chequer-board
floor and the Red Queen repeatedly screaming `KILL HER' as Alice holds an
axe to Rains' neck.
I challenge any-one armed with this information to not find themselves
theorising about what could and could not be a subtle reference, keeping
count and seeing who amongst friends spots the most.
Expect DVD extras by the bucket load to blow the cover for this
interesting
semi-secret but such is the modern market that nothing goes un-dredged to
fill spare CD space.
