I loved this movie, and I'm not afraid to admit it.<br /><br />First off a little notice: I don't know the games.<br /><br />The story, like many before will undoubtably have said was pretty much
crap,
I'm not going to defend it... Doesn't really matter, the story was
irrelevant anyway. It's supposed to be a horror-flick, does anybody
remember
Nightmare, Halloween or Friday, if you can find a story in any of those
'classics' let me know.<br /><br />What this movie was is a lust for the eye. It looked so incredibly slick.
The set decorating, the make-up, the costumes, the whole visual department
did such an incredible job, that even though, the story had no content
what
so ever, the movie was so easy on the eye, that I didn't want to turn it
off, because of this.<br /><br />A lot of people could learn from this. Sure, a story is important, but add
a
unique visual style, and you have a double jackpot.<br /><br />That's my 5 cents.
