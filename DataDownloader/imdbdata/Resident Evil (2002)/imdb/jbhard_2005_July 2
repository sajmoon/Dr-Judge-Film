As a fan of both George Romero's films and the original video games I
found this movie to be horrible. No, I don't expect every film based on
a game (or a book) to be identical to the source material. What's wrong
with this film is what's been wrong with movies (especially horror) for
the last fifteen years. It caters to the short attention spanned. Quick
and illogical cuts peppered with bad camera tricks took me right out of
this movie. One minute someone is on the ground surrounded by undead,
the next he is 'edited' up onto his feet and running for his life. HUH?<br /><br />I thought the 1940's and 1950's had it bad with Abbott and Costello
running the Universal monsters into the ground. Hey, at least their
films were INTENTIONALLY funny. Resident Evil isn't even
UNintentionally funny. So, with no humor, that leaves horror to carry
the film, which it doesn't. Why? Because like most films of the last 15
years, it's all quick cut action with no suspense. Creating tension
takes time and consistency, something most modern film makers don't
seem to understand. This film plays like a commercial or a music video
without music.<br /><br />Once again, the characters are completely unsympathetic. They say dumb
things and they do dumb things. Once again, the 'modern' tough, smart,
strong, cool, sexy female stomps all over the proceedings with muddy
feet. SHE BOUNCES OFF A WALL AND KARATE KICKS ZOMBIE DOGS! Oooh! I'm so
scared. I'm just not sure what to be scared of! I suppose I'm scared of
seeing an equally appalling sequel.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this film - DON'T. This is 90 minutes you can never
have back. In the age of DVD, there's a wealth of good horror to be
found. Better yet, Video games are fast becoming better than modern
films. Resident Evil the game and it's sequels (especially 4) out class
this pile by miles.
