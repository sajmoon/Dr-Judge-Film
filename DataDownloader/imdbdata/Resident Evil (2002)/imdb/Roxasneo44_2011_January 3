I have my reasons. For one, Alice really bugs the crap out of me. She
has amnesia, special powers, a bland personality, and a magical ability
to stay alive. Apparently, she&#x27;s a VERY powerful weapon. She&#x27;s also the
main character. ...How&#x27;s that for a shocker? :o <br /><br />Alice also doesn&#x27;t really have much of a background story. What&#x27;s
interesting about a super-powered, bland, nearly invincible, amnesic
Mary-Sue with no depth? Nothing. She&#x27;s a waste of time and space. Leon
S. Kennedy, on the other hand, ISN&#x27;T. They should have made the whole
freakin&#x27; movie about him, if they didn&#x27;t want it to be accurate. I
would have also given to see Ada in this one, too. Goddamn
cookie-cutters.
