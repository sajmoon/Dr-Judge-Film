After reading a review that wasted time pointing out plot holes and the fact
that he found only one character he could relate to, I have to pose that
question.  This movie was very scary.  The make-up work was very good.  The
action scenes worked very well.  It was some good, hardcore horror. 
Besides, what did you expect from a movie based on a video
game?
