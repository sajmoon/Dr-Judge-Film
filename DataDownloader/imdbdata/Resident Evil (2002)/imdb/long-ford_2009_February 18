For a film based on a video game, Resident Evil has a very sluggish
start. It takes well over an hour for the plot to gather steam. This
hurts it a lot. The production design at least initially is good though
the Special Effects have already dated and look tacky. The performances
are generally decent and Milla Jovovich has good screen presence. There
is plenty of blood and gore and the film is definitely not for the
squeamish. There are a lot of plot-holes and the action is not very
thrilling. This is an average flick that still remains better than it&#39;s
sequel &#39;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&#39;.<br /><br />Overall 4/10
