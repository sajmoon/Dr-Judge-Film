This film is exactly what I needed. A very hot chick kickin'
zombie ass. What could anyone else ask for? The gore level is sub-par for
your average zombie flick, but this is made up for by the fact that there
is
an actual plot. The plot unfolds itself perfectly. The lead in to it's
sequel will make fans of the game happy. I could have used some more zombie
action and gore. The zombies looked great when they did hit the screen.
I'll
be patiently awaiting the sequel. It's not a perfect film, but it sure did
put a smile on my face. This film is very grim and dark from the start.
Much
like the game it captures the tone of &quot;survival horror&quot;. The dark
atmosphere
of this film is rare in today's horror films. Take this one for what it's
worth and enjoy the ride. I give it 8 stars out of 10.
