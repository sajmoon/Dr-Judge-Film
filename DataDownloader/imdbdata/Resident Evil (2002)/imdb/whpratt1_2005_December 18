The title of the film sounded very interesting and then I got rather
tired of seeing a gal running around in a red slip and boots. The girl
in the red slip finally was given a man's coat to cover herself up and
still she continued to wear this outfit which started to get torn and
in threads. Out of the blue, all these so called human beings appear
like in the &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;, eating everyone in sight and
leaving nothing on the bone. It did not take me very long to become
completely disinterested and finished viewing the film with great
disappointment. Everyone seemed to run around in circles and there was
nothing outstanding about this film from beginning to end. Very cheap
made film and that red slip and boots really got to ME !
