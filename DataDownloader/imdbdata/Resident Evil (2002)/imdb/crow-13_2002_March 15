2002_March 15 

maybe I shouldn't rip into this film so much, as I did see it at a free
sneak preview.  and I'm not really a gamer, only playing the &quot;resident
evil&quot;
games a bit, and mostly watching the game being played and picking it up at
various points throughout.  but I'm a huge fan of
zombie/splatter/gore/horror
films, and so therefore I can honestly say that if you're debating about
seeing this film, my advice would be to skip it (or see it at a matinee,
definitely not worth $8) and wait to rent it on video.<br /><br />the strongest aspects of the best zombie films- &quot;evil dead&quot;, &quot;dead alive',
&quot;cemetery man&quot;- as that they are irreverant and refuse to take themselves
seriously.  but paul anderson in &quot;resident evil&quot; takes himself much too
seriously, which eventually ruins any promise the film might have had.  I'm
just wondering why I was bored throughout the flick.  during the mansion
scenes, the introductory office scenes, making the way to the Red Queen-
sure there was the occasional scare and fright, but it wasn't until they
shut the computer off that I thought &quot;is it finally going to get
interesting?&quot;<br /><br />perhaps I was just waiting and was expectant too much for the zombies.  and
they didn't disappoint.  in fact, the special &amp; visual fx of &quot;resident
evil&quot;
were quite good and was definitely a highlight to the film.  as was the use
of audio in providing the suspense and building tension.  (although the
score created by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Mansion is garbage and
unnecessary.)  however, the acting was just putird.  milla jovovich just
CAN'T act.  she's best when she just sits there and looks pretty w/o
opening
her mouth- as in 'dazed and confused' and 'fifth element'.  sure she's a
hottie, and it's quite obvious the paul anderson tried to come up with any
reason to show off her body as necessary, but that's jsut sticking to the
tired horror film cliche of showing the primary female in various stages of
undress.  nothing new there.  and what's up with the complete obnoxiousness
of michelle rodriguez's character.  she delivered every one of her lines
compeletely flat and her attempts at humor were ridiculousness.  it got to<br /><br />the point where I despised her character, didn't care that she was
infected,
and in fact felt pretty good when her character was offed.  michelle sure
has tumbled swiftly from her promising debut in &quot;girlfight&quot;.  you couldn't
have done a more poor job casting for the two primary female roles.  they
definitely don't measure up to angelina jolie in &quot;tomb raider&quot;, which
although wasn't that great of a film, it is much better and more fun and
doesn't take itself as seriously as &quot;resident evil.&quot;  the other cast
members
are incidental for the most part, though it did kind of bug me that the
most
gruesome deaths were saved for the characters of color.  whats up with
that?<br /><br />and the plot kind of bugged me- I understand the computer's intent on
killing everybody off once the toxin escaped, but the computer was also
aware that the dead would eventually become reanimated, yet took no steps
to
take care of that eventual side effect, such as torching the Hive or
something similar.  it did have a failsafe programmed in, thus providing
the
countdown of our heroes having to escape from the Hive, but it was- in my
opinion- too much time allowed with the possibility of escape of the toxin
too high.  and I didn't quite understand the rationale behind the crack
team
going into the Hive- the reason given was to find out why the Queen went
homicidal and to take apart the mainframe, but ti seemed far too dangerous
and unnecessary for me.  then again, when you work for the shady Umbrella
Corporation, I guess you jsut don't ask questions and blindly follow
orders.
even when they lead to disastorous results, as can be seen at the end of
the flick.<br /><br />anyways, its not as if this film is horrible or incredibly bad.  I just
found it boring.  even Romero's epic plodding &quot;dawn of the dead&quot; I found
more interesting than this flick- perhaps because it made me think and it
stimulated my mind, whereas &quot;resident evil&quot; didn't.  regardless, if you
like
loud/ fast/ zombie/ splatter films with half-naked babes and plenty of
blood, then &quot;resident evil&quot; is the film for you!
