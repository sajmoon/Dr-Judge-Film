I've been a fan of the game series for a long time, and I think the movie
is
an excellent addition to the franchise. If anything, the story is
explained
better in the movie because it is condensed and presented all at once. Of
course, there's nothing like a romp through Raccoon City with your own
shotgun to discover the hidden screts of Umbrella. Clearly there is room
for
both the movie(s) and the games, even if the stories differ slightly in
some
places.<br /><br />The scariest thing to me, though, is how possible the incident at Raccoon
City is. As a Cellular and Developmental Biology major, I have seen how
easy
it really is to manipulate the genetic code of organisms, even with basic
laboratory equipment. One of the first experiments performed by biology
majors is to transform (modify the genetic code) of E. coli bacteria. The
bacteria are typically given immunity to a specified antibiotic, in
addition
to a gene that allows transformed bacteria to glow when exposed to UV
light.
While bacteria are particularly easy to modify, it is certainly possible
to
modify other organisms as well. &quot;Transgenic&quot; food, as well as new
advancements in pharmaceuticals have proven this. Will we ever see human
experimentation or an outbreak like in Raccoon City? Hmm...
