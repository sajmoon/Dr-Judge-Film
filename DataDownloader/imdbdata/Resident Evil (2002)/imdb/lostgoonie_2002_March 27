Fortunate enough to be invited to an advance screening of the new
&quot;Resident
Evil&quot; movie, I went along with a niggling voice at the back of my mind
reminding me of how cheap and nasty the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; movie turned out to
be...<br /><br />However, I was pleasantly suprised when my favourite game of all time made
it's screen debut - it LOOKS like a George Romero movie, it SOUNDS like
one,
it even SMELLS like one! At last, a decent zombie flick for the
millenium!!!<br /><br />The first 15 minutes or so chug along superbly, a pounding metal heartbeat
in the background guides us through the cataclysmic events that mark the
beginning of the end for the Umberella coporation (or IS it? Baaaahahaha!
etc)  Without giving too much away, this movie is the
splatter-gore-death-undeed-dead-corpsey-doom-fan's
ultimate movie, central characters being killed off left right an centre
(yaaaaaay!!! Nobody ever does that any more!), convincing zombies, and the
undead dobermans.....maaaaaaaaaaaaan....as a bonus, they don't include the
awful music from the first Res Evil game (remember, when the dog comes
flying thru the window in the corridor? That dodgy keyboard drumbeat thing
kicks in, arrrghhhh).<br /><br />90 minutes of pure bliss - snappy one-liners, some absurdly good acting
for
this kind of movie, and enough blood and sticky goosh to keep any die-hard
fan happy.<br /><br />For Wesker's sake, ignore the critics -  GO SEE THIS FILM, we won't see
one
like it until...well, the sequel!<br /><br />Until then, I'll be the one hiding in a quivering heap under the table
:)<br /><br />Cheers!
