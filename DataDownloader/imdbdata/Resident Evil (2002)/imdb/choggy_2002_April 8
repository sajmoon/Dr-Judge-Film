2002_April 8 

Okay i have seen some rubbish video games films like super mario bros,
tomb
raider etc, but resident evil is without doubt the best ever. I am a fan
of
the games so i knew what to expect.
The story is simple enough. A super computer kills everyone inside an
underground lab after a huge experiment has gone wrong. A crack team of
soldiers are sent in to investigate but end up running into a hoard of
zombies and other nasy things. I wont spoil it by going into too much
detail
but for those who are a fan of the games then you will like the
ending.
Milla Jovovich, in my opinion, was terrible. I feel they should have cast
someone else for her role. But MIchelle rodriguez plays the typical hard
female soldier brilliantly.
I was not expecting it to be a brilliant film but it was, forgiving
MIlla's
Rubbish acting and the mistakes. Paul Anderson, as we all know can do
games
(Mortal Kombat)and horror (Event Horizon) Well done paul for giving us an
entertaining film.
