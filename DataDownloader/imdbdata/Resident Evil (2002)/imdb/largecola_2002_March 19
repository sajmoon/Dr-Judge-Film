This movie is not half as bad as people say it is. In fact I was quite
suprised by how entertaining it is. The special effects on the zombies are
quite good, and the action/gunplay is well done. Milla does quite well in
the lead role, although her character doesn't get much of a chance to
shine.
She seems poised to have a great role in the sequel.<br /><br />Even the &quot;Red Queen&quot; that everyone seems to hate isn't that annoying, and
she's only in about 15 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />While the film doesn't have the creep/chill/scare factor of the games,
over
all it is recommened to any fans of action movies. All in all this a good
movie that is the prequel to what should be a fantastic
film.
