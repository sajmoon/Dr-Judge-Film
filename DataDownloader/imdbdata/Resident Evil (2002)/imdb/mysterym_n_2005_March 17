The Resident Evil films, the first film and the sequel are both great
films. I can understand that you who didn't play the games on
playstation and didn't know what to expect, hate the films... For those
of us who DID play and still play the games, they are nothing but
fantastic.. For those of you who criticize Resident Evil, you really
cant be into horror flicks. If you aren't, don't see these kinds of
movies! Resident Evil has everything for people who love horror.. A
story, nice cast and a lot of suspense! I think this movie is hell of a
lot better than f.ex. The Ring, because this film keeps you on the edge
the whole time, something The Ring does not do.
