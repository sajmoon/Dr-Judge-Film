I am a fan of the Resident evil games and i must say that this film is
absolutely brilliant! It's a great kick ass movie that takes it's time
getting to the good bits and then the action never lets up. This is one of
my favourite zombie films and i watch it over and over again! It's
definately up there with the top zombie films i.e. Zombie: Flesh Eaters
and
Dawn of the dead.<br /><br />The music in this film adds to the enjoyment and Paul Anderson should give
himself a pat on the back as this is great film making. Yer maybe it
doesn't
follow the story of the game but if your a fan of zombie films ignore the
game and enjoy yourselves and the ending  should please all you resident
evil game fans out there(it sure as hell pleased me and made me beg for
the
sequel to be here soon!)<br /><br />The film has it's game related stuff i.e. the dogs and the licker which i
enjoyed watching them come to life on the big screen. So sit back grab a
bite of pizza, have a couple of beers ready and sit down for one
rollercoaster ride of a movie!<br /><br />
