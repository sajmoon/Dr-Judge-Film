One of the most disappointing videogame to movie films yet. Let me tell you
some back info on this film. Back in 1998 when there was first talk about a
RE film, George Romero was contacted to ink a script. The execs refused his
script because it used aspects of RE 1 and RE 2 and they felt it wasn't
going to be a good film. Then comes Milla Jovovich ranting and raving how
she wants to make a RE film due to her appeal to its macabre style of
action/story. When the film was finally released I could not help but see
that it was nothing more than mixing aspects of PART 1 and 2 of the games.
Badly mixed at that. There was nothing original about this film. It took
bits and peices of other films mixed in with amatuer computer graphics and
matrix fx. To top it off the use of one of George Romero's key signature
scenes as a climax was a true insult to the zombie king himself. The
creative team behind this film, including Milla Jovovich, has taken a great
concept and turned it into another box office insult. For the love of god I
hope that another is not released with the same production team and the
leading actress Milla. What was supposed to be a prequel and not interfere
with the storyline provided by the games has destroyed all integrity
established by the original creator. AN INSULT TO THE RESIDENT EVIL GENRE!
