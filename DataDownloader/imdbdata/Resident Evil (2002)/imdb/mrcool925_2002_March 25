2002_March 25 

My friends and I had been waiting for Resident Evil to come out since 2001
one. Finally, on March 15th, it opened, and we were there.<br /><br />At first, I thought that because I hadn't read the books or played the
games, the movie wouldn't make much--if any--sense to me.<br /><br />The movie started, and the first ten minutes I was sitting there going
&quot;What
the hell is going on?&quot;. Then, BOOM!, it all made started making
sense.<br /><br />One of the characters had no memory of what was going on, so using this as
an excuse to explain everything (for the audiences benefit), the story is
told.<br /><br />The rest of the movie was awesome! It just completely blew me away. It
made
sense, too.<br /><br />Of course, some of you guys are wondered if the movies follows the books
or
the games exactly. Nope, it doesn't. Different characters, different
plots.
