Think about it. Wasn't this movie supposed to be scary? The mansion was
scary and Jill, Chris, Barry, and Wesker would have been prefect
characters. Instead of the big, tough, stupid military losers. Resident
Evil is about puzzles, traps, less zombies, and big monsters. Not hot
girls, big guns, and loads of action. I still enjoyed this movie a
little bit but its not Resident Evil. It would of great to see the big
snake, the hunters,the tyrant, and the original characters. And the
story would have been much better. The acting wasn't that great. The
editing was horrible. I still had a little bit of fun with action
scenes but with all the monsters looking as cheap as they did it took
me out of the experience.
