2002_April 29 

Actually, it's something of a mixed bag, but the good far outweighs the bad
in this case. I'll start with the bad first. The bad news is that the film
seems a little tame in comparison with the computer games, which are some
of
the bloodiest and most creepily atmospheric releases the video game world
has seen. Often, when you want to see blood gushing everywhere, all you
will
get is a relatively nice and clean death. A bit disappointing, but that's
to
be expected when the Moron Picture Association of America steadfastly
refuses to acknowledge that adults watch films, too.<br /><br />The good news is that the same creepy atmosphere that made the games so
grand, and made such interesting films as Night Of The Living Dead the way
they are, is well-represented here. During each and every scene, one almost
leaps out of their seat, anticipating the attack of a spider or a licker.
The clever references to the games are also quite well-done, as is the
reference to Day Of The Dead. Milla Jojovich really does a great job of
bringing Jill Valentine to life, and the rest of the cast, anonymous though
they may be, do a bang-up job of supporting her.<br /><br />Frankly, I cannot wait for the director's cut on DVD. I want to see more
blood and gore.
