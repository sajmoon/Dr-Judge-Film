I have seen a lot of movies in my time, but this one kicked their
butts! It got my number 1! In about 2005 I went to a friends place for
her Birthday. We all sat down and started watching some movies. This
was the only one that we could agree on. I was entranced through out
the entire movie. The story, the characters, the mythology, it was
captivating.<br /><br />A beautiful woman in a red dress, suffering from amnesia and being
surrounded by anyones worst nightmares is enough to get the movie
going. The progression was fantastic. Things never turned out the way
you would expect.<br /><br />After I saw the movie, I hired it a few times from Video Easy. After
about 3-4 hires I couldn&#39;t do it anymore. I needed to buy it. I bought
it on VHS, but I was disappointed at the quality. I watched it another
ten times. I then hired the DVD a few more times. During that time, I
hired, watched (46 times) and bought Resident Evil: Extinction. We went
to Thailand for a holiday, and I bought a copy the number 1. It was a
pirate. Disappointedly, I came home and bought it again.<br /><br />After watching it a few dozen times, and researching Resident Evil on
the net a few times I was ecstatic that there was a third coming out. I
counted down the days for the next 9 months and got a group of 10
people and got them to join me in seeing it at the cinemas. We all
loved it. I heard nothing bad from anyone. My blood felt strange, and I
was in awe for the next week. I am just waiting now to buy it.<br /><br />If I could, I would send my money directly to them.<br /><br />I have watched the original about 30 times now, Apocalypse about 46
times, and Extinction 7 times. I bought the original Resident Evil on 3
different formats. If that doesn&#39;t say how good this movie is, I don&#39;t
know what does.<br /><br />A really well done movie.
