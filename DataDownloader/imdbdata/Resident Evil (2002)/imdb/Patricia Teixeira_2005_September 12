Hi!! I'm 13 years old and in spite of my age i'm a very big fan of the
movie!Besides it's my favorite!The movie was excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!I
loved it but i was disappointed with the ending of it due the fact of
Matt(Eric Mabius)and Alice (Milla Jovovich)were separated and Matt
became a monster...!I mean..., it's a sad ending... I think it would be
a very cool ending if Alice and Matt staid together and in the second
film the two of them fight together against the zombies, joined the
other new characters!! But besides that it was really
cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I loved the sequence and the actors, specially
Eric Mabius and Milla!! I highly recommend it!!!!!!!!
