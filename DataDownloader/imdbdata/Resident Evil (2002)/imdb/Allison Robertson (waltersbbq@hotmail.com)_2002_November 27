2002_November 27 

I've been waiting for this movie, ever since I saw it go into Green Light
back in 1998. I read in Empire magazine the film was in the works, and who
was the lead back then? None other than Sarah Michelle Gellar. Although it
wasn't confirmed, I was thrilled to read the basic plot, as my brother got
me playing the video games not long before I read the article.<br /><br />The film itself has connections to the game, but you don't need to play
them
all to understand it. The cast, which actually is made up of a few Brits,
become likeable. Those who make it through the first 30 mins anyway. The
few
who meet their end in the laser hallway don't really have much dialogue,
so
it's not loss seeing them die. Milla (a good-looking actress, yet to prove
she's anything more to me) is clearly totty for the lads. Lets face it,
who
on Earth wears a slinky dress like that when planning to stay in for the
night!? Does she feel the cold?<br /><br />I didn't quite follow the absence of Jill Valentine, and instead the
choice
of naming the lead Alice... I may have missed something in the games
there.
I'll admit, I'm no whizz at playing them and staying alive.<br /><br />Back to the film.
I found the zombie scenes pretty tense. Although it doesn't take much to
get
me biting my nails, you do want a few of the cast to live through the
film,
so the action scenes were both entertaining and scary. the scenes with the
zombie dogs were great.
Michelle Rodriguez and Martin Crewes aren't on their best form here, but I
still liked their characters. Both their deaths come as a surprise.
Arguably, Rodriguez's zombie-turn sucks. I wanted her to get through it
all,
but her death was cool. I wasn't overly keen on Eric Mabius. He's pretty
wooden throughout the movie, and I wasn't too bothered if he was killed,
or
not. Although I am looking forward to the outcome of his bizzare arm
incident in the sequel.<br /><br />The licker showdown at the end provides a few tense moments. It's not
right
to say the thing didn't look real, or convincing, because this is a film
about zombies... I have no idea what the licker was all about, or if it is
a
reference to the games, but it keeps the action going when the crew are
rid
of zombies. Just as everyone is out fine, the thing appears and sees off
one
of the crew, while another turns into a zombie. The ending was slightly
perky for a moment, so the re-appearance of the monster and two deaths is
my
kind of ending.<br /><br />The actual ending, with the Manson theme is excellent. From what I know,
the
ending was something similar to the opening in one of the Resident Evil
video games. (I could really do with a trivia site to explain the links,
or
gaps between the film and the game. I get the feeling I haven't played all
the Resident Evil games....)<br /><br />Generally I'm not too sure I'd tell anyone to see this. Some people aren't
too keen on, or convinced by the whole zombie theme, or find action scenes
annoying and loud, but I enjoyed the entire film.
As for the kids who play the games.. (be honest, people younger than 15,
or
R-rated, I think it is in the States, play the video games) they'd
probably
love all the action. Like Tomb Raider, they might get bored with all the
banter and explanations, but they'd get a kick from it...
9/10 from me.
