Ok, first of all, Resident Evil is the best movie adaption of a video game
ever. Red Queen is one of the meanest villians ever, i mean sending a
laser
to prepare the elite group for the feasting zombies later. Milla Jovovich
clad in a dress a jacket kicking a doberman's ass and snapping the neck of
a
zombie between her thighs is down right awesome. The Licker is just how I
imagined it, much more gruesome than the one from the game. Special effect
and graphics were all right but they needed to improve on the movement
because you could barely seen the details of the Licker. All in All, I
give
Resident Evil 9/10, kick ass movie once again.
