quite frankly any body who thought or says that this film stays true to
the roots of the game has NEVER played the games. this idiot of a
director raped all of us fans of a long awaited film. he made this
disgrace claiming he himself is a fan. i cannot believe he would
rewrite the script, when there was a perfectly good script to work
with. he had video games, books, a whole history of RE to refer to but
no. where was chris? barry? the ultra cool albert wesker? and the way
jill is portrayed in the 2nd complete hash of pauls hideous and
downright disrespect to this masterpiece of story lines and incredible
characters. i say every TRUE fan of the game series tracks down this
'appauling' monster and inject him with some deadly virus. if u want to
watch a film just to see zombies getting shot watch this. as a fan of
the greatest game created(for its genre) stay clear of nething with
Paul W.S. Anderson on it!!
