I like horror movies. GOOD horror movies. But in the name of those who have
not played the game i can not recommend this film. I almost fell asleep.
The
whole thing seems to be a pure money-making try. No real effort in it to
make it a real MOVIE. Each and every second of it is stolen from somewhere,
which can tell much about the attitude of the makers for the expert. Well,
I
have seen very good re-makes, so this does not mean anything. This could
have been a good piece after all. But there should have been any concept in
it, and not only cliches. I guess the audience of this film is the players
of the game. Those who are very sensitive of logical errors. Well, I lost
counting somewhere around one hundred :) OK. It could have been a good
movie
even with these errors, if the makers had anything to do with suspense. Not
only up and down, up and down, monotonously. Fingers appearing on the
screen
is NOT a terrifying moment. If they make one of it, they destroy the
suspense in the film. And that is what they actually did, throughout the
whole film. Should it be just a little bit worse, I would have left the
theatre at halftime.
Yes, there are some good points as well. But miss Jovovich's beautiful body
wrapped in a tiny piece of cloth or some good songs can not save the film.
This is a failure.<br /><br />Please forgive me for my poor English. I hope you could still understand
what I am to say.
