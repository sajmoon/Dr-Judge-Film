Could have been better...  The premise is pretty good but the film cops out
by reducing the amount of gore in order to get an R rating.<br /><br />For instance, the cool scene showing them getting sliced in the hallway by
the lasers, was cropped.  I wanted to see big hunks of meat lying on the
floor, yet the camera quickly cuts away so we don't get to see much of
anything.  I think a scene like that should be graphic since it shows
everything else, short of what's being piled up on the floor. <br /><br />In Anderson's previous film, EVENT HORIZON, the implication (of gore) worked
pretty well but not here, imo.  The result being that the scene looks cut
instead of implied because the director shows too much restraint. <br /><br />Fear of censorship, Mr. Anderson?  That's understandable since something
like that could have qualified for the UK's &quot;nasties list&quot;, so why not have
a director's DVD cut for those who want more gore?  <br /><br />And some of the cgi looks sloppy with the torn up faces of the walking dead
looking more animated than real.  I think if they spent more time on it,
they could've made it look better.   <br /><br />There's also an ending that looks like something out of the 70s film THE
OMEGA MAN which is kinda cool, too.  We don't get to see too many ambiguous
things like that anymore. <br /><br />I hope a future director's cut adds some more blood, guts and gore to it
because this EVIL is holding back.<br /><br />5 out of 10 for being cropped
