I saw Resident Evil on opening night and it was awesome.  The acting in it
was great and the direction by Paul W.S. Anderson was good as well.  Also
the film stays true to the games and is pretty violent.  Also, the &quot;Licker&quot;
from Resident Evil 2 looks awesome.  It looks just like it does on the
game.
Also, the zombies are really cool looking.  The dogs were pretty cool
looking.  This was a great movie.  I jumped a few times while watching it
(which i think is necessary in a horror movie).  Also, the hologram girl
was
really freaky.  Overall, Resident Evil is a great movie for fans of the
games or of movies in general.  I give it 10 out of 10 stars.  I can't wait
for the sequel.  Go and check it out!!
