I would have to say that this goes well in the same category like Plan nine
from outer space, basicly a neat idea with horrible execution.
This movie must be cool if you are like 13 years old and enjoy the games,
for all others, dont bother.
The plot has more loopholes than swiss cheese, acting is so-so, I counted at
least five encounters in the movie where the microphone used in production
is clearly visible ... shame shame ...
Good idea, terrible movie, dont waste your money.
