When Capcom's game of the same name first hit the market, it got many
critic's praise due to its unique gaming style and for its excellent
atmosphere of horror and suspense. Six years later, this movie version
has neither followed the story or characters (this movie is rather a
prequel of the game) nor presented that unique atmosphere of survival
horror. In the end it turned out to be a cheap action movie with
blazing guns, bloody gore, raw language and other accessories. The plot
was a bit planned at the beginning but messed up in the end. Apart from
all these, the movie simply rides the top with the help of a new fresh
Milla Jovovich.<br /><br />Well, when you place Ms. former Joan of Arc in a skimpy red party dress
with an assault rifle in hand you win half of the battle. But besides
Milla is lucky to have a fine character on which the director offered
much more attention than the story itself. And indeed she is good in
such roles. And she was well assisted by good background soundtrack and
camera angles. And a provocative ending too, allowing the viewers to
dream whatever they can for Resident Evil 2.<br /><br />In all, the movie is actually nothing. You go just to watch Milla. and
considering that I'm giving it no more than ***.
