2002_September 7 

First off i think that the critics were very harsh on there comments of this
film.  Half of these so called critics probably havn't even heard of the
'Resident Evil' franchise and therefore their comments really dont have any
effects to my view on the film.<br /><br />Ok, so it wasnt exactly an award winning film but it still had enough
ingredients to make me want to see it again, and buy it on DVD.  Milla
Jovovich was quite good as Alice though i did find i couldnt really bond to
her as the main character to well.  Michelle Rodgriguez on the other hand
was very impressive as the hard-ass Rain, her performance was only marred by
the harsh fact that she probably is too young to be in an elite special
force??? - but apart from that she was great!  Eric Mabius (Matt), Martin
Crewes (Kaplan) and Colin Salmon (One) were all good as supporting
cast!<br /><br />The films special effects are brilliant and director Paul Anderson uses his
imagination well to build a story around the resident evil game.  It's a
shame we didn't get to see more of the mansion in which Resident Evil is
known and loved for.  The twisted metal music score is excellent to this
film and Marilyn Manson must be applauded in the way he handled the high
tense scenes within this movie.<br /><br />Resident Evil: Nemesis is in the pipeline for 2003 and hopefully it will
have the same pleasing effect as this film did.  It will also be nice to see
some familiar looking characters be introduced into the sequal i.e. Albert
Wesker!!<br /><br />A great film - 8/10
