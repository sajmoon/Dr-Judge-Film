2002_March 24 

Seen &quot;Dawn Of The Dead&quot;, &quot;Aliens&quot;, &quot;Species&quot;, and the first-season
&quot;X-Files&quot;
episode &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot;?  Then you've seen the bulk of this
particular film.  However, the pacing, special effects and photography, and
interesting and carefully-maintained balance of all those twenty-year-old
traditional sci-fi/horror elements make this a tasty tidbit.  And I imagine
those who've played the game will be enraptured, as will those who can't
get
enough of the suspense-splatterfest genre.
