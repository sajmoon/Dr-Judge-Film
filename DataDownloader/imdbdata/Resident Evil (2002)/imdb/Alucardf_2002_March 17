As far as I can remember, I liked Poltergeist the most.  When I was young,
it made me make lots of nightmares, it was very popular.  Prince Of
Darkness
and The House On The Haunted Hill are 2 others that I liked because of
their
originality.  I am not counting The Others or the Sixth Sense as high
level
horror movies though I liked them a lot.<br /><br />Finally, here comes a very good horror movie, not stupid, about zombies
and
without stereotyped teenagers.  For the past 3 years, I've rent movies and
I
was looking for a good zombie movie.<br /><br />Resident Evil, the only movie that surprised me after seeing The Matrix.
Good luck for the sequels!<br /><br />
