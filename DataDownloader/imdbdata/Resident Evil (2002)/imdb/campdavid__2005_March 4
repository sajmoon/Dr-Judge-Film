This movie was terrible by any standards. As a stand alone film it just
lacks any dramatic tension or suspense. As a film of the game it
doesn't work on practically any level. It has a completely different
atmosphere, cast of characters and plot to the game. With most computer
games you might think that this is acceptable, but resident evil was so
great because it actually had a good plot and atmosphere, it was a
pastiche of zombie horror movies such as dawn of the dead and evil dead
(old mansion out in the woods). This movie has none of the values of
the original games or movies, its a true popcorn movie, by the end you
feel like you have eaten so much rubbish that your burps smell funny
and you feel like you are going to be sick. Anderson destroyed it.
