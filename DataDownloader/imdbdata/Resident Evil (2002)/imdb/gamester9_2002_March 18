Paul Anderson must of had me in mind when he created this film. I saw the
film opening night and must say that it was exactly what I expected the
film
to be. I expected the film to have some elements of the game to appease
the
fans of the game and at the sametime have elements that didn't involve the
game for the people who have never heard of the series
before.<br /><br />I read some reviews before hand and was quite disappointed when people
said
that the film was incoherant and hard to follow. I have to tell you that
these people LIED during their reviews just to give people the wrong idea
of
the film. EVERYTHING was revealed during the film, all they had to do was
pay attention.<br /><br />I don't want to give anything away with this film. It was a wild ride. One
of the greatest parts of the film was the ending. If you are a Resident
Evil
fan, you will nod your head and say that I'm right.<br /><br />Unbelievable. I still can't believe Paul did this good of a job. Now if
only
someone would write a Castlevania movie.... hmmmm might just have to do
that.
