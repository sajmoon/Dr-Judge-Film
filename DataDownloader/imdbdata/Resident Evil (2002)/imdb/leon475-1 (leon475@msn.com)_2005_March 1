This movie spoils the RE franchise by adding a underground train
station in the famous mansion that does not exist in the video game and
featuring a different outbreak of the t-virus.<br /><br />Alice (Milla Jovovich) is a good slick character but the rest of the
cast are just dire.<br /><br />The movie features a lot of inept events such as the laser sequence
which is not very resident evil at all.<br /><br />The action scenes are dull and leaden.The scare factor is low compared
to the games greyness.<br /><br />Overall an inept display of tedious action but the ending is attractive
and hoping the sequel will be to.
