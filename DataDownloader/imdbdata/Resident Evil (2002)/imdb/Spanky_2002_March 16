I went into this expecting to see another horrid big screen take on a video
game and came out totally surprised! The biggest plus in my opinion is
probably the films worst enemy. People are going to go in expecting to see
the Games. Instead, you get a whole new story starting before the mansion
incident. This is I believe is what led to the mansion incident. And it
ends
where RE3 starts (Raccoon City has already been taken over by Zombies).
Anyway, this was a very good movie, effects were great, the gore wasn't
watered down or sissified. And the zombies stayed true to how zombies are
supposed to be, slow clumsy dullards with only one single intention,...
Food. And it was great to see a Zombie flick on the big screen nationwide!
I'm big zombie buff so this was my heaven, love those living dead guys
=)...now if only a small local indie theatre would run a living dead
trilogy
marathon I can die a happy man... Check out Resident Evil, don't expect the
games, but a story that leads into RE1, and you won't leave
disappointed
