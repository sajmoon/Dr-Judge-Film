I don't think that Video Games turns into movies are a good idea (All of
them sucked so far) but this film was pretty ok. It does not have the
creep
factor of the video games but it does hold up in the scare department.
While
it did need a much better script to go by, the story here is decent.
Hopefully, judging by the last scene of the film, the sequel should be
much
better.
