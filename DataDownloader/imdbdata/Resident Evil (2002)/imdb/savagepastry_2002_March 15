wow.  such a horrible movie.  if you :<br /><br />a) have played any resident evil game
b) have ever seen a romero film
or
c) desire more from a horror movie than bad cgi, worse dialogue, and
terrible pacing,<br /><br />then, please, do yourself a favour, and do not see this movie.  i played
through the first few resident evils, and the ONLY similarities between
the
film and the game were :
1. the &quot;umbrella co.&quot;
2. zombies
3. racoon city<br /><br />everything else in this film was typical, generic hollywood glam.  you can
almost make out the glue-laden intersections where they slopped together
pieces of other movies to form this monstrosity.<br /><br />if you liked fast and the furious or any of that other brainless,
hollywood
eye candy, then you may get a kick out of this.<br /><br />the rest of you would sooner enjoy a seizure.
