Since George Romero and his praised &quot;The night of the living Dead&quot;,we
have seen so many movies in the &quot;zombie genre&quot;,even in a &quot;spaghettti
way&quot;(Italian versions),but this flick must be the most budgeted until
now with some &quot;Star Wars&quot; styled stages,the plot is similar to its
predecessors:one lethal gas escaping from an advanced laboratory(common
places before)and turning its workers in living dead,Alice(nice Milla
Jovovich)after to betray her work,decides to lead and set free a few
survivors from the disaster in a freaky way:kicking off in the air
higher than Bruce Lee,mixing Lara Croft and &quot;Kill Bill&quot; to combat
zombies and mutant dogs in the same way as the known video game.<br /><br />Amusing film,the best:Milla her pretty body and that sexy gown,boots
included,but all the line of the history is predictable,if you want
&quot;fast-fun&quot; watch it,no more to look for.
