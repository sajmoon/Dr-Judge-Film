This movie had me wanting more to the minute it ended. It stars Milla
Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, Martin Crewes, Eric Mabius, James Purefoy and
Colin Salmon. <br /><br />The opening scene with everyone in the hive dying, made me think, ok it's a
computer/electronics type movie. But then when the Commando's went down to
investigate the hive, yo start seeing everything.. IT'S A ZOMBIE MOVIE, this
is only because I have never played the game. If your a true blood and guts
type horror fan, this is defintly for you.
