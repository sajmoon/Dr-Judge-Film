Ok, there is nothing original about this film, but, as with a number of
films being made recently, it can somtimes look original because of the
recent love with computer graphics and eye-pleasing cleanliness of of
recent
movies.<br /><br />Milla looks great and proves herself once again, even if there is little
clothing or script available sometimes.  Some might say that she was a
little too undressed for the film's rating, (but I reserve opinion as I
like
to think I'm well balanced enough not to be affected).<br /><br />The action is very cool; violence equally so - although some taken (come
on
guys, admit it) straight from the excellent, minor cult movie 'Cube'.  My
only grudge on the sfx and action is that we could have seen the hologram
a
bit more.  My only grudge on the storyline is that it was asking me to
stretch my disbelief almost that bit too far, which even I can do quite
frequently.<br /><br />All in all, I now realise they may have been saving a bit of the budget
for
the sequel - which I hope lives up to it's future hype.  I must
congratulate
the script writers, sfx guys and actors for a job well done, considering
game-to-movie conversions have not faired so well (see the excellent 'Wing
Commander' - yes, I stand by that).
