I am not a great fan of the games, I know about them and have spent a few
hours in front of them. Not that they are bad but I did lack the
time.<br /><br />The movie acctually manages to capture the feeling of the games, very well
indeed. The hopeless situation and the dejectedness of the people trying to
survive. The movie also has a game like look and feel to it in the
beginning. Watch the first scenes with Milla in the mansion and tell me if
you agree...<br /><br />The game style diminishes when the action picks up in pace though. And it
really do keep a nice pace trough the rest of the film.<br /><br />I was afraid that the end would spoil the movie in some way but it acctually
lifted the overall impression one notch!<br /><br />One thing (the thing?) that I think could have been done better or even have
been left out was the &quot;Big Monster&quot;. It wasn't really state of the art and
didn't really fit in. It didn't affect the overall feeling though and I can
live with it.<br /><br />The story is good, it follows the original story with the evil Umbrella
company performing illegal experiments and the effects of them is what we
see. Screenplay lacks some but this isn't a drama, it's action so it doesn't
really shine trough. Even the effects aren't that spectacular but they don't
need to be. Less is more. Finally the movie score, I loved it! Hard,
fastpaced and matched the movie close to perfectly.<br /><br />This is proof that computer games (console rather...) do make great movies.
Just give the idea to the right person!<br /><br />7/10
