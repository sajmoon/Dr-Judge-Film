Like most people, I was a little worried on how this movie would turn out. I
tried to keep abreast of its production and was on tender hooks over the
famed &#145;Romero &#150; will he / won't he saga'. The finished product was a
pleasant surprise seeing how most video game conversions are pretty
dire.<br /><br />This wasn't exactly faithful to the original story line and it moreover
seemed like a mix of both the first and the second game. However, it had a
number of great touches and had all the elements you would expect to see
such as the mansion, the zombies and the dogs. After what seemed an initial
slow start the film soon gathered pace and turned into a rollercoaster ride
with the viewer being treated to shock after shock. I was impressed with the
zombies and the dogs were great, the clicking sounds of their approach was
very reminiscent of the game. <br /><br />Milla's acrobatics, especially during the dog attack, were a little pathetic
and I found this a negative point. It seemed as though the kung fu antics
were only there to represent some contemporary  need to show every heroine
as a Buffy equal. Another bad point was the use of CGI for the licker. The
end result simply looked bad. I also didn't care much for Rodriguez's
character who seemed to be in the movie just to utter silly one
liners.<br /><br />The negative points dealt with, overall this was a good film that I  really
enjoyed. The ending scene was excellent and definitely wets the appetite for
the sequel.<br /><br />
