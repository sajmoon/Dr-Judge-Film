I am a die hard fan of Resident Evil video games. The first Resident
Evil for Playstation is a grand daddy of all the survival horror games.
It was a scary game just like every sequel. I was happy when i heard
there's going to be a movie based on the game. And as it turns out,
it's a pretty good movie.<br /><br />Many fans of the game complain about the plot. They don't like the fact
that it isn't based on any of the games scenarios in 100%. We don't see
any familiar characters. No Jill, no Leon, no Claire and no Chris. But
i think it's a good thing. It just wouldn't be fun. Everyone would know
what is going to happen and how is it going to end. We still have all
the most important elements taken from the game. We have the Umbrella
Corporation, we have the zombies and a 'licker', people trapped in the
building fighting for survival and of course there's the T-Virus.<br /><br />Other people complain that the movie isn't scary enough. And i
understand those people. I mean, it was obvious that a movie based on a
survival horror game, has to be a horror movie. But it isn't. It's a
Sci-Fi Thriller. Maybe that's why I don't hate it. Before i went to the
theatre and saw it, i was told what to expect. A thriller - not a
horror movie. I admit that this is a little bit of disappointment,
because the movie had a full potential to be a solid horror movie, but
it's still good as a thriller.<br /><br />So if you haven't seen it yet, and if you're planning to watch it,
don't expect to see a horror movie. You're gonna see a sci-fi thriller.
