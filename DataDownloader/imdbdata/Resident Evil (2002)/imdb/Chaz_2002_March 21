Made me want to shoot myself more than they shot monsters. It was awful. As
I sat there i wondered when i could get a gun to shoot myself. I wasnt
going
to walk out because it would have been an exceptional reason to shoot
myself. Other reasons in the past haven't measured up to this one. Thank
you
resident evil for sucking so bad.
