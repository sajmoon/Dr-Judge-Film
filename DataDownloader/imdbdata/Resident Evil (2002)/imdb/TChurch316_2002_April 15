One of the few video game movies to ever come out that are similar to the
game itself and done well to boot. We all have suffered through the likes
of
Mario Bros., Tomb Raider, etc. We finally have a payoff in Resident evil.
It
also set up well for a sequel to the movie by still sticking to the video
game storyline.
