Words cannot describe how bad this movie is.  The acting is subpar, the
plot
is by the numbers, and the movie moves slow.  Do yourself a favor and rent
&quot;Dawn on the Dead&quot; and skip this one.  There is nothing new to the Zombies
here.  The zombies will do nothing more than make you yawn. On a scale of
1
to 10, this movie gets a 3.<br /><br />
