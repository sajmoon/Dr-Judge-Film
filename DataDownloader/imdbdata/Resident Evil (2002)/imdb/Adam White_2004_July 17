This movie should be terrible. It's director has an awful track record
(although I did enjoy Event Horizon), It's full of unknown actors and it's
based on a video game. But somehow, I enjoyed it. It's not going to go into
my top ten list, or even my top 100, but it is an enjoyable way to waste an
evening. The special effects were terrible and the action scenes cliched and
badly done but it all adds to the appeal of the film. The game itself is
very tongue-in-cheek and the movie reflects this, although not quite as
much. It could have been a lot worse than it was and I suppose that adds a
lot to the reason why I don't give it too bad a mark. An average film, but
entertaining nonetheless.<br /><br />6/10
