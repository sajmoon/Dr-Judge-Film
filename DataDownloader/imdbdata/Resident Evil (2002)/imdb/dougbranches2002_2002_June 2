2002_June 2 

I am seriously shocked.<br /><br />Let me just state that I usually respect other's opinions, and I understand
some people just may not like this movie, but I have to wonder just how in
the hell someone could have disliked this movie enough to make negative
comments on it at a website.<br /><br />Ok, so maybe they don't like horror movies. Then why even go see it? Why
even make a comment on it if you don't like horror movies?<br /><br />Maybe they wanted the movie to follow the game...uh yeah, great idea.
Instead of the original take on the storyline, let's have a recreation of
the scenes in the game, since you know, everyone wants to already know
what's going to happen.<br /><br />Maybe they felt it was just too devoid of any depth. This one I'll give
some
credit. This movie is slim on character development, but it's a horror
movie. Anyone who has played the games know character development isn't
high
up on the priorities. To me at least, the games atmosphere and just all
around feelings of something wrong is what makes me enjoy it. I am a zombie
movie fanatic. But, strangely enough, I HATE with a passion the comedic
zombies, like the ones in Dead Alive. I'm into the feeling of doom one gets
when seeing the beginning of Day of the Dead, with the ravaged city
overrun.
You know, the armageddon angle of the Romero films, or the ending of
Fulci's
Zombi.<br /><br />Back to RE. Whatever reasons there might be for disliking this movie, I can
safely say that if you're reading the comments for it, you've already seen
it or you're at least a little interested in the genre. In that case, you
won't be disappointed. I went into it expecting another shoddy
game-to-movie
translation like Street Fighter or some other garbage. What I got is one of
my all-time favorite horror movies(Yeah I said it). This movie takes the
atmosphere from the game and goes a different direction with everything
else. It's either fast-paced action or tense scenes that really convey the
feeling you get when playing the game, walking through a deserted hallway
wondering what the hell is gonna happen next. But on to the part that
solidified this movies position in my all-time favorites
list...<br /><br />The ending. I have read some of these comments bashing the ending, and
honestly, what the hell? How is this a bad setup to a sequel? I rank this
as
my favorite ending EVER. Yeah better than any other movie I've ever seen.
I'm not saying everyone's gonna love it that much, but I did. The music
kicking in at just the right time, the carnage-filled streets, it all fit
together perfectly, and I haven't been looking forward to a sequel this
much
in a LONG time. As long as Paul Anderson keeps the same style throughout
the
second one, this movie will be THE zombie movie. I guess I just don't get
how someone could say the ending is setting up a sequel that will be &quot;even
worse&quot;. I am looking forward to where the citywide destruction angle goes
VERY much...<br /><br />In closing, give this movie a chance. I'm not saying hail it as the
greatest
film to ever be created, or to hate it like alot of these other comments
would have you believe you should be doing. I'm saying just sit and watch
it
for yourself. Maybe you won't like it. But maybe you'll love it like I
did.
