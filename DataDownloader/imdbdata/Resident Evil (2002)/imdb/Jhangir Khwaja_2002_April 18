I just finished watching this movie and all I have to say is bring on the
sequel. .  .<br /><br />No offence whatsoever to Paul Anderson, but I'm hoping the next installment
gets passed on to someone like David Fincher. After all this is same man
who
brought films like The Game, Fight Club, Alien 3, Se7en and the latest
Jodie
Foster feature &quot;The Panic Room&quot;. With the added bonus of non-stop thrills
and suspense.<br /><br />Although the movie stayed faithful to the video game I was hoping for
greater blood and gore afloat, but I suppose were just going to have to
remain with this one till 2 comes around.<br /><br />The only disappointment I had with the film was that Jennifer Love Hewitt
(originally casted) left the project two years ago not to mention legendary
&quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; director George A. Romero as this would've
restored his credibility status.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich though was really a sight to behold, a bit dumb though with
scenes of breaking zombie's necks and fly kicking mutated dogs and a dose
of
martial arts crap.<br /><br />One thing that impressed me about the movie was the similarities it had to
films like Aliens, Demons and of course The Living Dead. Lets just hope
that
part 2 can dish more with David Fincher at the helm, with more frights and
Jumps.<br /><br />Just bring it on!
