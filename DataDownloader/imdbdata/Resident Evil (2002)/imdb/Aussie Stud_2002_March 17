Okay, so &quot;RESIDENT EVIL&quot; wasn't up there in the high ranks with films like
&quot;ALIENS&quot; and &quot;DAWN OF THE DEAD&quot;, but it still gave me a reasonable amount of
scares that I haven't experienced since the late 1980's.<br /><br />Primarily based on the successful video games, &quot;RESIDENT EVIL&quot; is a brooding
piece of work that builds up suspense and horror in a claustrophobic-like
atmosphere where a group of soldiers and two guards must infiltrate the
headquarters known as 'the Hive' of a high-tech operation known as 'the
Umbrella Organization' to shut down a mainframe computer that is known as
'the Queen Bee'. Little do they know that all 500 employees working in the
Hive are now dead and have been re-animated as zombies while all other
creatures inside have mutated into horrifying monsters.<br /><br />It appears that someone broke into the laboratories to steal a
heavily-guarded experiment known as &quot;The T-Virus&quot; which has the ability to
re-animate the dead. When the virus is stolen, the culprit throws one of the
test-tubes containing the virus onto the floor which shatters, resulting the
Hive in shutting itself down and trapping everybody inside the underground
complex.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich is one of the guards who was supposed to protect the Hive.
She is found in an outpost with severe memory loss of her identity and
occupation. She along with the group of soldiers and one more guard are
taken deep into the Hive. When all Hell breaks loose after the zombies and
monsters are unleashed, you will be taken on an unforgettable thrill ride
that will leave you riveted to your seat!<br /><br />Most of the praise for this movie lies within the special effects. I enjoyed
seeing the zombified dogs and the creatures inside the huge metal
containers. The only thing I was a little disappointed with were the zombies
themselves. I am very serious when it comes to my zombies, so I was very
excited to see the ones featured in this movie. When one man is attacked by
a swarm of zombies and is basically eaten alive, I expected to see some good
shots of limbs being torn off or flesh being eaten. Instead you only get to
see a few of the zombies 'pretending' to bite into him as he screams, and
later when he himself has been re-animated as one of the undead, the only
signs of his demise are a few bite marks and some trickles of blood running
down his face. Other than that, it appears as if the zombies didn't even
bite into him at all! A few other scenes also display the same issue - one
including a moment where a man is killed after a mutant beast 'eats' him,
yet when looking closer at his body in a later part of the film when he too
becomes one of the 'undead', he also appears not to have been injured
greatly either. One might think that they originally died from
fright!<br /><br />One small minor problem I had with the movie was the lack of characters left
to 'survive' a sequel. The ending was fantastic - a deserted city scape left
in ruin and pandemonium by something horrific, a door left open for a future
sequel.<br /><br />I hope they make a sequel. I remember when &quot;STARSHIP TROOPERS&quot; came out and
all actors involved had signed on for a trilogy, yet it performed very
poorly at the box office meaning no sequels would be made. I don't care if
&quot;RESIDENT EVIL&quot; only makes $1.00 in its opening weekend, I want to see a
sequel!<br /><br />My Rating - 8 stars out of 10!
