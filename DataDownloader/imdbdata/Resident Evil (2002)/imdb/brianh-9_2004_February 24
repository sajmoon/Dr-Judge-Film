This is one of those films only some of really like. This does have those
who find it entertaining. I would love to see a sequel. I enjoyed so much I
went and saw it twice at the theater. I thought it was well made with good
production values and had the intrigue that made the game so much fun(my
brother and I spent a lot of time playing the first two games). I believe
fans of the game will be pleased overall with this effort. It's perfect
viewing late at night when you can't sleep and just want a good scary movie
to watch. It's one of those rare films I can watch over and over. I thought
the film had a good blend of action,gore,scares,and intrigue. That's all I
ask. Inevitably,this film will be compared to other zombie films,but it
doesn't bother me.
