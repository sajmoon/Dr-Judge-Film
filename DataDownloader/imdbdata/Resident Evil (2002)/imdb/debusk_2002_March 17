This film is actually decent. Don't listen to the critics who'd rather be
watching art house films. If you love horror movies then you'll at least
like this movie. Fans of the games should enjoy the familiar material,
however you don't have to be a fan to enjoy yourself. Good time for all
who
love a bit of blood and guts!
