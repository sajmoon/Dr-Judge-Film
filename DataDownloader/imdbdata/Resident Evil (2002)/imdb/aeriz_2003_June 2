A fresh revival to the horror genre.  Intelligent, modern telling of the
classic zombie monster.  A great adaptation of a great game.  Memorable
scenes recreated in live action showing that not all game to film movies
suck.  Anderson, jovovich, rodriguez, they're all fans of the series and
that represents the voice of all the other fans who made the series what
it
is today.  Compared to other zombie flicks like night of the living dead,
this film is more believable since its explanation for what's going on is
actually possible and it makes sense why these zombies are actually
dangerous.  I mean, in NOTLD, the zombies moved like a block an hour.  How
can anybody really get caught by them if they actually tried to get
away?
