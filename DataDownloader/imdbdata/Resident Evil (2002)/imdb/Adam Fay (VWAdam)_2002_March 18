2002_March 18 

I have one word to describe this film: laughable.
For the first 20 minutes, the movie follows no definable plot. It leaves the
audience utterly confused.
There were about 60 other people in the theatre at the same time as me, and
a goodly majority of them were laughing right along with me at this horrible
game to movie translation.
The only faintly interesting monster is the Licker towards the end. The
zombies look nothing more than extras with poorly applied make-up and that's
exactly what they are.
I have one question to the makers of this film: Is it so hard to use the
already well established and well written plot and story from the Resident
Evil games?
If it were up to me, I would go the easy route and straight up translate the
game to movie form. Apparently CapCom didn't want to let Paul Anderson have
the rights to the story as he would so obviously have screwed it
up.
If you absolutely must see this film, go ahead and waste your $5 to $8. If
you want a good zombie story, play the Resident Evil games.Or, if you're
dying to see a zombie move, go to your local video store and rent George
Romero's classic Night of the Living Dead.
I now see why Luc Besson divorced Mila Jovovich.
