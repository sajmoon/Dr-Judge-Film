Resident Evil follows a team of commando&#39;s investigating an underground
biolab after a reported incident occurs inside of it.The incident is
more severe then any of them suspected as the former employees are dead
but they are still walking around and they are hungry.<br /><br />Seeing as Resident Evil was originally a groundbreaking horror game
you&#39;d think this film adaptation would be a mirror image of it however
this movie only has elements of the game in it spread out through
various visual effects, lighting, and set design everything else is
completely different.Director Paul WS Anderson (Mortal Kombat,AVP)
intended this movie to be a prequel to the game and show how and why
the viral infection escaped however many did not know this and
immediately hated it because the storyline and characters in the movie
were never in the game.<br /><br />The elements of this movie are a mixed bag.The acting is very good
especially Milla Jovovich, Eric Mabius, and James Purefoy but Michelle
Rodriguez gives her one trick pony tough girl act again.The script is
at times suspenseful and at times god awful mostly coming from poor
dialogue and badly delivered one liners.Visually the film is gritty and
very grainy with a very cold colour temperature which creates suspense
but looks at times boring and unappealing.The music in the movie is
also mixed sometimes it&#39;s absolutely perfect others it&#39;s loud and
overbearing however the main score is an absolute masterpiece thank you
Marilyn Manson.The action is raw and hardcore, the gun brawls are great
but the hand to hand is weak and cheesy especially when it&#39;s Milla vs
the zombie dogs.The special effects are pretty good but at times far
too unrealistic and far too fake looking for example some of the gore
and CGI effects(the licker is obviously CGI).<br /><br />This is probably Paul WS Andersons best film it&#39;s not perfect, it&#39;s not
brutal but gamers probably won&#39;t like it too much.The film is mildly
entertaining but the lack of special effects and good hand to hand
choreography you generally see in an Anderson film (Mortal
Kombat,Soldier) are missing in the otherwise fun film.The trailer isn&#39;t
misleading if you&#39;ve seen it you know what you&#39;re getting into n
action/horror that isn&#39;t supposed to be taken too seriously.
