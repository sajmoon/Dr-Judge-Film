Being a fan of zombie-movies and the biggest Resident Evil fan in the
Northern Hemisphere, I loved this movie.  The scenery was superb.  Some of
the shots are taken directly from the game and give any true Re fan a
feeling of coming home.  This has been my most anticipated movie for a
long,
long time.<br /><br />The plot is fairly basic but works very well:  An experimental virus has
been released in a top secret, underground facility. A team of highly
trained, highly equipped &quot;problem solvers&quot; working for the Umberella
Corporation is sent in to take control of the situation.  As they enter
the
superficial cover of the mansion that is the entrance to the installation,
The Hive, they find an unconscious Alice(Milla Jovovich) and a cop named
Matt(Eric Mabius). After acquiring their two new members they break into
The
Hive and the fun begins. The computer &quot;brain&quot; of the Hive has gone
homicidal
and wants to kill everything within its grasp. After they go underground
the
action starts to run together and be non-stop, but in a Very good way.
Possibly lurking around every corner is a zombie or something much, much
worse. The scene to really watch for is when the team enters the corridor
outside the main computer control room.  Also not to be missed is the nude
scene Milla Jovovich did. HOT HOT HOT!!!  This movie works on so many
levels.  It is a great movie that really entertains and has a thumpin'
soundtrack. ROCK ON PAUL ANDERSON.  Hurry up with the sequel.
