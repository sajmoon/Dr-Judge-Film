I admit I liked this movie, maybe because I didnt expect too much. Acting is
ok, Zombies could have been a little scarier, but so what. CGI not top
notch, but hey, this is not The Two Towers. Milla did a good job like the
rest of the crew/cast.<br /><br /> All in all good entertainment and fun.
7/10
