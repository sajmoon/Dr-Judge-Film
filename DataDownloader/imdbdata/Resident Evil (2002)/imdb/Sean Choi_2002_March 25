Resident Evil, the latest film from Paul Anderson--not to be
confused with a much better filmmaker, Paul Thomas
Anderson--looks great enough, but it feels like a feature-length
compilation of familiar scenes from a handful of superior horror
and/or sci-fi films, e.g. George Romero's zombie flicks, the &quot;Alien&quot;
films, Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, and The Matrix. The film
doesn't break any new grounds and would have been better
served, I think, as a &quot;direct to video&quot; release. The film features the
beautiful Milla Jovovich (The Fifth Element, The Claim) who, along
with several others (most notably, Michelle Rodriguez from The
Fast and the Furious and Girlfight), must contain a chemical
leakage at one of those secret underground laboratories which
you find from time to time in sci-fi films like this. Unbeknownst to
this crew, the contamination has turned all the workers in the lab
into &quot;zombies,&quot; a group of walking dead who are driven solely by
the instinct to feed on living flesh. As you might have expected, the
crew has to fight off the zombies, resulting in plenty of carnage and
gore. Resident Evil is a gory film. What the film lacks, however, is
any real suspense or genuine scares. And the soundtrack is one
of the loudest I have heard in a long time; I wasn't scared by the
film, but several times I got scared that I might go deaf. (I guess
the philosophy behind this tactic is: if you can't scare them, jolt
them.) I should also mention that the film features several almost
nude scenes of Jovovich which are sort of disappointing and
anti-climactic (you sort of keep wishing that the damn towel, etc.
would fall, but it never does) but might turn out, in the long run, to
be the best part of this dead-brained film.
