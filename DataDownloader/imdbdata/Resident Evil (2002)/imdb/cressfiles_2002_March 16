I had high hopes for this movie; I thought &quot;maybe this will be the one that
turns around the fate of action game-to-movies&quot;. Nope. While Rodriguez and
Jovovich were good within their characters, the plot, the interaction
between characters, and the animation sucked. Big time. The movie was so
predictable; the cresendo of music tells you when the next
creature/character jumps out. If you do still want to see it to see the
gorgeous Milla perform stunts in a dress and shorts, rent it. Otherwise,
just look at the photo gallery and save your money.
