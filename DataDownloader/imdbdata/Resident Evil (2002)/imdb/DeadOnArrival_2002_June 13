I saw this movie the second day it came out and after see it, I came to
this
conclusion: THIS MOVIE SUCKED! The acting: horrible. The music score: Done
by Manson so you KNOW it's gonna suck. The director: Horrible, again. Paul
Anderson sucks as a director but is even worse when he writes the scripts.
There wasn't even a scary moment in the movie. I would have much prefered
George A. Romero's version a whole helluva lot better then this one.
Bottom
line: This should have remained a video game but hollywood screwed it up
to
no repent. I can just imagine how BAD the next one will be. I can only
imagine.
