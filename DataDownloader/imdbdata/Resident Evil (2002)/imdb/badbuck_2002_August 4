2002_August 4 

this movie was so good. i love the video game and thought oh well just
another bad movie made for the fans of the game,(WRONG). my wife has not
ever sat down and watched myself and my son play this game but when she
watched this movie she was on edge. now the acting was a little bad but
hey,the story and the effects were great. i never watch a movie twice but i
saw this at the movie's and rented it as soon as it came out. i would
recomend this film not only to the fan base of resident evil but for people
that just want to sit back and enjoy a good horror flick.
