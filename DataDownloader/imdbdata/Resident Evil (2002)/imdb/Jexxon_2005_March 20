A virus that turns people into zombies is released inside a secret
research facility. A couple of expert (I'll use the term lightly)
soldiers are sent in to retrieve... something... I can't remember what
it was, but I'm sure it isn't very important. Along with them are two
amnesiacs and some other guy. Once inside, they have a limited time to
get out again. Unfortunately, the dead have risen and zombie bashing
ensues.<br /><br />You can't expect too much of a film based on a video game, but all the
same - Resident Evil feels pretty sloppy. It has got a low budget feel
to it, just witness the sparse settings, dodgy effects, and amateur
make up. There isn't much in the way of character development either,
so it's not easy to give a damn what happens to them. Also, it's not
good when there are numerous plot holes in a film with little plot to
begin with.<br /><br />There is a distinct lack of action as well. It takes close to half the
film before any zombies show up, and even then it's just some erratic
shooting accompanied by too fast editing and deafening rock music.
There's not a lot of gore and blood either, which isn't good
considering that it's a zombie film after all.<br /><br />It's not the worse film ever made - the premise is quite good, but
wasted - but it resembles too many other films, and fails to show
anything new or even remotely exciting. Milla Jovovich does her best
with what little she's given, but she deserved better. Obviously,
director and screenwriter Anderson doesn't have what it takes to put
together even a half decent video-game film. There are worse films out
there, but that doesn't mean that there's any reason to see this one.
