I was really shocked and amazed by this movie. First of all - nice
adaptation
of a game (that's really strange...) SUPERB sound &amp; visual effects (laser
room....). I thought The Others was kind a scarry, i was frightened ~3-4
times while watching it, but when we are talking about a Resident Evil i
must say that THE MOVIE IS FRIGHTENING ALL THE WAY from cast listing in
the
beginning of the movie till cast and credits. One more thing - soundtrack:
great songs by Rammstein, Merilin Manson, Fear Factory, The Crystal Method
and others. GREAT MOVIE - 10/10
