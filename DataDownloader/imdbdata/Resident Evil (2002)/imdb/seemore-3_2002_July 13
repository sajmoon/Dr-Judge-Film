Being an avid fan of the Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy and Resident Evil
computer games, I had been to see the former two movie adaptions in good
faith.  Tomb Raider ended up being a damp squib despite having a perfect Ms
Croft, and Final Fantasy a stunningly beautiful piece of animation in an
emotional vacuum.  So it was with some trepidation that I ventured out to
see what the movie industry had done to our beloved Resident
Evil.<br /><br />I needn't have worried.<br /><br />Paul Anderson has really done his homework on this one in capturing
perfectly the essence of the Resident Evil games and without alienating the
non-video game players.  He has delivered a tense, action packed and well
paced horror movie with all the signatures you find in the games.  In fact
it was fun spotting them all: room identifications, ie. Dining Room B,
Control Room, etc.; wading through water; locked doors; key codes; finding
alternative routes; dog's toenails clattering around corners; I could go on
and on.  The only things that weren't included were the typewriters and ink
ribbons!  Saying that, you certainly don't have to be a fan of the games to
greatly enjoy this movie.  But if you are familiar with the games, it does
add another dimension to it.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich is simply fantastic as the lead female protagonist.  Her
acting abilities give the movie an added dimension if it needed one at all. 
She gives a real sense of vulnerability whilst also kicking ass. At the
beginning, her sense of wonderment at where she is and what is going on
reflects perfectly the state of the player when first starting a Resident
Evil game.  Then the pace at which she pieces it all together is spot on. 
Oh, and the rest of the cast do an excellent job too.  Even the soundtrack
is superb.<br /><br />My only two criticisms are slight.  The CG effects on the monster are a bit
ropey and some scenes suffer from being a bit over-lit.  However, this is
just nit picking on my part.<br /><br />The gore level is well judged.  Paul Anderson seemed to know that he had to
put enough in to keep gore freaks happy, yet too much would have distracted
from the tension, (a minor fault I find with John Carpenter's otherwise
excellent The Thing.)  No, instead, Resident Evil relies admirably on
developing genuine dread.<br /><br />Resident Evil the movie has turned out to be one of the best horror/action
films I've seen for a long long time.  And of one of my favourite computer
games to boot!  <br /><br />Sheer Heaven.
