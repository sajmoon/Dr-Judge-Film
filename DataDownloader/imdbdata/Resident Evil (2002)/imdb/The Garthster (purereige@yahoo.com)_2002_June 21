From the opening title sequence to the apocalyptic ending, this film tears
you away from your chair and pushes you headfirst deep into its murky
depths. Being a film based on a video game, you'd expect a film with
non-stop action and visual effects, but without in-depth characters or good
writing. `Resident Evil' keeps its characters fresh and interesting, enough
so you at least care what happens to them, and has more than enough original
plot gimmicks to break out of the sci-fi/ horror genre, but still manages to
deliver the action, special effects, and zombie gore that the fans of the
game love. <br /><br />I never played the games too much, but I know enough about them to know that
this film takes its share of liberties. The characters are not the same ones
out of the games, and those who want to get picky will notice that some of
the notable creatures out of the games have been altered a little to drive
the plot along. But the changes are so small in relation to the overall
storyline, which is right on with the game. <br /><br />The thing that saved the film, though, is the direction. Director Paul
Anderson's mix of action and horror was perfect for `Resident Evil.' (His
first big hit was 1995's `Mortal Kombat,' the first of the successful video
game movies, and what I believe started the whole video game adaptation
craze in the first place).  He brings `Night of the Living Dead' to `The
X-Files' and actually creates some genuine scares. The score by Marilyn
Manson helps, along with the grinding heavy metal soundtrack, to create a
feel that is dark and creepy one minute, pulse pounding and exciting the
next. The sets are another thing that play a key role in this film. Just
like any of the countless haunted house films out there, the environment is
as much a character as the actors, and this film pulls it off nicely. It
explains everything thoroughly, without over-explanations of every single
thing that happens. This film won't puzzle you, but it doesn't insult your
intelligence, either.<br /><br />Overall, the film is excellent, especially considering the horror films from
the past few years. It doesn't attempt to be more than it is, but what it is
is quite enough. No over the top horror acting, no over-the-top horror
violence, but just enough to please. <br /><br />I recommend this film to fans of the game and to those who didn't know there
was a game.<br /><br />
