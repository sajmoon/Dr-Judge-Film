Resident Evil is a definite &quot;need to see&quot;.  I would not recommend taking
your kids, very graphic violence.  The only part that I didn't like is
that
it did not go into any detail about the people in the underground complex,
in other words, not enough background history.  Overall, I give this movie
a
7.  Good movie.
