Okay, pay no attention to the 7.0 rating. If you have any good taste and
think good movies have to have actual plots, actual characters, and some
decent dialogue, do not see this movie, because it's horrible.<br /><br />The main actors in this movie have done much better work (Milla: 5th
element, Michele: girlfight), and everyone else in the movie was pretty
much
just there to be killed or take up space. There weren't exactly charcters.
I
didn't even catch any of their names. There was hardly any dialogue except
for the usual &quot;What is that?!&quot; or the pathetic comedic one liners from
Michele. We learn absolutely nothing about the characters themself,
because,
once again they weren't characters.<br /><br />OK OK I know that's alot to expect from a video game adaption (is it
though?). I mean, going into see this movie I was at least hoping for some
decent zombie stuff to happen. But there was nothing! The zombies looked
like people picked up off the street, covered in flour and ketchup and told
to scream at milla jovovich. Even the computer generated thing that got out
from it's cage, whatever it was, was pretty bad looking, not a memorable
creature at all.<br /><br />So basically it all adds up to this:
Pretty much everything in this movie has been done before AND
better:<br /><br />Zombies: &quot;Dead Alive&quot;, &quot;Evil Dead&quot;;
Butch Pretty Girl Heriones: &quot;Alien&quot;, &quot;Terminater 2&quot;;<br /><br />The Laser Sequence: &quot;Cube&quot;;
CGI Monsters: &quot;The Relic&quot;, &quot;The Mummy&quot;, &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;;<br /><br />Boring Characters (if you could call them that), Dull Plot, Bad Acting, Bad
Editing, Bad Visual FX, Bad Dialogue... etc etc etc.<br /><br />HOWEVER
I did like the dog sequence. The dogs were OK looking, and the whole slow
motion kick was done pretty well I think. Only if they had more of that and
better characters and zombies.<br /><br />4/10
