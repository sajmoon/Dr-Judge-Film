2002_April 20 

I have to admit that I expected to see a movie geared towards a teen crowd
not looking to watch a film, but just to see action. While this isn't the
most cerebral out there, it's more than I thought it would
be.<br /><br />The bad: Well, at times the action does get tedious and convenient. For
example, there's a scene where they get trapped in a room. A laser shines
down the room at head level. Then it shines again at head level. Then it
shines yet again, but this time forming a criss-cross pattern. Now, this
laser is a defense mechanism, so why go for the criss-cross pattern right at
the beginning? Why mess around? Things like that and some of the dumber,
repetitive action scenes can get annoying.<br /><br />The good: I like movies which throw you into a situation where you are in
the dark, and that's where this starts off. From a science lab, we see
someone break a vial and leave the lab. From there, it switches to a woman
in a mansion. No one knows what's going on (including her), and draws in
those people wondering what went on (like me). The story is laid out where
you don't feel manipulated and there are enough turns in it that you don't
get the feeling that you know what's really going to happen. I also have to
admit being surprised about the ending, but I liked it. The acting is what
you'd expect, and the score fits well with the scenes.<br /><br />Having not played the game, I can't say how well it takes from the game, but
I can say that the movie is accessible for someone who hasn't played the
game, and it's worthy of a rental. <br /><br />Bottom Line: It's a good action movie to watch on a Friday night with
friends. 7/10 <br /><br />-Mark
