I really enjoyed Resident Evil, it was really good for a video game movie...
it had that suspense to it also and it wasn't corny. I never thought Paul
Anderson would do such a great job at directing this movie. because i kind
of thought Mortal Kombat was a dissapointment. But i reccomend this movie to
people who are fans of the game or just want to get scared... it's great! i
give it 8 out of 10.
