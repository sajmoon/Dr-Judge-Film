When I saw the trailer, I thought it was going to be more imitation of the
Matrix, but I was wrong. This movie starts the game off but in another
facility which may have been a plot hole since the personnel get turned
into
zombies, someone would notice that tons of people are missing. The plot is
simple and looks like it did come from a B- video game, but hey not all
video game plots are complicated (like many people complained about Final
Fantasy). The movie itself was not as gory as some may think (Romero
wanted
stuff like dogs biting through the back of a commando to rip out its
heart).
The reactions of the commandos when first encountering zombies was perfect
since they had no idea what they were getting into. The makeup for the
zombies were great especially those that could dislocate limbs for the
added
effect. Nice! The Red Queen keeps you guessing whether or not it is evil
or
good or just doing what it was programmed to do. The licker, although did
not totally look like the original from RE 2 (and this is before it
mutated), it still looked cool. When it mutated, oh my, makes fans ask
&quot;Why
wasn't it in the game?&quot; The ending which may be obvious but I won't say
PERFECTLY sets up for the games to begin and it also answers some
mysteries
namely the &quot;Nemesis.&quot; Kudos Anderson, you made a video game movie worth
watching.
