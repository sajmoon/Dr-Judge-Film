This movie was alright. I watched the movie with my friends and all of them
freaked out when they saw the zombies, but when you think of it..the movie
wasn't that scary. You could tell when all the scary parts were coming. Is
it just me or something? I did enjoy the movie until the end came. I think
the end could have been a little better. But other than that. Resident Evil
is enjoyable.
