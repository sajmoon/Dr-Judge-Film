Completely butchered the original storyline. Directed and written by
Paul W.S. Anderson; possibly one of the worst directors of the modern
era. <br /><br />Weak cast. No characters of the original idea appear in the film.
Instead you get a steady stream of poorly performed cheesy lines and an
absurd story line with bits and pieces stolen from the original
Resident evil concept. Video games do not survive the video game to
cinema transition. This is a painful reminder.<br /><br />I walked out on the scene in which Milla Jonavich did a matrix style
ninja kick to defend herself against one of the cerberus&#x27;s(zombie
dogs). They did a good job on those(Props to their prop/make up crew)
but used them in a way that just made them look stupid and a shameless
rip off from the matrix that doesn&#x27;t fit into the the original RE story
line.<br /><br />Paul Anderson completely butchered the concept of Survival Horror and
replaces it with loud death metal and machine guns. There are too many
movies already like that.<br /><br />Comparable to &#x22;The House of the Dead&#x22;
