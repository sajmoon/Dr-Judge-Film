2002_November 4 

Long before it came out when I first about the plot for the Resident Evil
movie (Red Queen computer?) I was very disappointed. I probably wouldn't
have gone to see it but the day before I was shipping off to Army Basic
Training I went to the movies and they were showing RE and Blade II. I
decided to watch RE and I was very pleasantly surprised. It's a really
good
movie despite some really stupid plot holes. My only little &quot;gripe&quot; with
the
movie was that it was action not horror unlike the games. Through the
whole
movie I felt kinda like &quot;This has so little to do with the Resident Evil
games&quot;. Then the guy says &quot;I want him for the Nemesis project.&quot; and I'm
thinking &quot;Oh please, that's just cheap.&quot; But when it was over and I
looked
back on it, I loved every second of the fun-filled, action-packed ride.
Milla and Michelle were both great. No one else really stood out too much
(not at all saying they weren't great). I enjoyed the Red Queen more than
I
expected I would. And I must say the last scene just kicked major arse!
Eagerly anticipating the sequel.
