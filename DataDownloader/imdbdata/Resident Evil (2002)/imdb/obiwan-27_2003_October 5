No, I'm not kidding.  I was so bored by the convoluted beginning of Resident
Evil, that by the time the first zombie popped up and took a chunk out of
Michelle Rodriguez, I was half-asleep.  But that's okay, because judging by
the movie's first half hour, I'm pretty sure my dream about walking down to
the post office to pay bills was better.  It certainly had a more coherent
plot, at any rate.<br /><br />Paul &quot;W.S.&quot; Anderson is confusing.  A lot of people call him a no-talent
hack.  I disagree.  I think he is a very talented hack who has made an
unfortunate decision to whore himself out to any studio who pays him enough.
 Early on, in films like Soldier, Event Horizon, and even Mortal Kombat, he
showed at least a little directing ability.  Now he seems to not even
try.<br /><br />Back to Resident Evil: There is nothing here you couldn't see in better form
in any other random scifi or horror or zombie movie.  I would skip it unless
you're like me and on a quest to see all bad movies.
