For die-hard fans of the original &#x27;Resident Evil&#x27; video game series,
this film may come as a disappointment, as the general horror and
darkness that made the games so unnerving has been ditched here, in
lieu of an intense action-thriller. Nonetheless, in its own right, this
film is highly entertaining.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich puts in a superb performance as Alice, who is lead into
an underground base of a multi-national corporation to do battle with a
series of ghoulies and monsters, including a horde of the undead. With
terrific co-star Michelle Rodriguez, there is never a dull moment,
moving at a furious pace with just the right mix of dry humour, mystery
that surrounds the &#x22;Umbrella Corporation&#x22; and its motives, and
impressive action sequences featuring an agile Jovovich in the dress
she&#x27;s barely wearing performing some remarkable stunts.
