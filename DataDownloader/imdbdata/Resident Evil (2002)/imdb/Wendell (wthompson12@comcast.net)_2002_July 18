I watched Resident Evil for the first time and immediately went right out
and bought myself a copy.  This is a movie to own.  The story is great, the
acting is good, Milla Jovavich is as hot as ever, and the action is
terrific.  The soundtrack by Marilyn Manson is beautiful as well.  A
grade-A
horror movie with plenty of blood and guts for all the horror
fans.
