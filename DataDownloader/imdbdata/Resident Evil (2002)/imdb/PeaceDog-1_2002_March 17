This movie is superb for what it supposed to be. Don't let the people who
obviously never played the games, haven't seen the movie, or can understand
artistic impression fool you. If you've played the game, it makes sense.<br /><br />I have to say that I disagree with a few comments about this being a  movie
for kids. It has nudity, extreme violence, language, and really graphic
gore. So parents beware. As far as the people bashing the movie because it
has a little Night of the Living Dead or Alien &quot;rips offs&quot;....uh HELLO,
that
is what the game is all about. The GAME is a rip off of the Living Dead
movies. If they didn't include those things, people would have been
complaining about that. The movie is very true to the game, and the games
popularity revolves around those other movies.
It has the birds, the dogs, the dead, the licker, the train, the mansion,
the chic, the conspiracy, etc. It may not have them in the same sense as
the
game, or frequency, as in the case of the dogs, but they are there (note:
the birds, when Milla walks outside the mansion).
Some other reviewers are saying that they can't believe how long it takes
them to figure out the &quot;head shot&quot; theory. How many zombies in the game die
with one shot? You guys are looking at this from the wrong angle. Did you
guys think Saving Pvt Ryan sucked because it had scenes really similar to
those old John Wayne movies?
Sure they could have made the movie more like the game, making them walk
back and forth between 8 rooms solving puzzles, but then how boring would
that have been?
Enough with the rant...the movie rocks, go see it so they will make a
sequel. It has the jolts and jumps of a true horror movie, the pace is
upbeat and it never bogs down. I don't believe they made this movie to be
an
Oscar contender anyway.
Look at it for what it is. It is a great escape just like the
game.<br /><br />10/10
