Personally I thought the movie was terrible. A complete disgrace to the
game. It should have at least followed the game.
I mean, here I am waiting for  the plot from Resident Evil to begin and
the
movie has already moved on into what takes place in the second game. None
of
the characters had their own personalities and suddenly the people who
couldn't remember a thing know everything. Not to mention that fact that
they all magically have fighting skills and have flashbacks that leave
the
audience in confusion.
It's as if you missed the begining of a great movie. Maybe some
background
info could have helped. I have played the game before and I was very
dissapointed. The special effects could have been better (some of the
monsters almost looked like very detailed cartoons). The only credit I
can
really give is to the Zombies who were portrayed very well.
The movie could have been better, if the crew knew what they were doing.
They should have assumed that not everyone in the audience would be fans
of
the game. They could have made a great movie and used it to sell the
game.
Hopefully the second installment will be better.
