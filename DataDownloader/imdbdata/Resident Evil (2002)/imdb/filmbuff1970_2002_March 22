First off i want to say i didnt hate this movie,It was just an average
action
horror movie that steals from Aliens,Night of the living dead.but the movie
i found it copying the most was Ghosts of Mars.I liked Ghosts of Mars
though
i admit this was better.The characters in this are less likable.and only
the
female lead and Tony Todd come close to being memorable.the direction was
good.so an entertaining movie that is better than most video game movies.6
out of 10
