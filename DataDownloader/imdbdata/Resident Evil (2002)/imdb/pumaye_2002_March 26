Much better than anticipated. Probably the best videogame translation till
now. Milla Jovovich is perfectly cast as the glacial heroin of this movie, a
great actioneer, with several strong scenes.
It is more Half Life than Resident Evil in my opinion, but who
cares.
The final scene is a great one, a perfect cliffhanger for a possible
sequel.<br /><br />
