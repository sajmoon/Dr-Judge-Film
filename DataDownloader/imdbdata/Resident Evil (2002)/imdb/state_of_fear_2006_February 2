I cant believe i just wasted about an hour and a half of my day to
watch a crappy movie which was based on a game. Now, i have played the
game and it is quite good, maybe if the story was based on the story
from the game but no, it wasn't. They changed the story which is one of
the best bits of the game.<br /><br />This movie is obviously for the people who don't watch many horror
films and who don't play any games.I personally thought it was crap and
even though i am eager to watch the sequel (to see if they stuck to the
storyline a bit more, which i highly doubt) i am still going to say it
once more.<br /><br />This movie is for people who want simple story lines and who want no
explanations at all.. For people who haven't played the game and for
people who don't watch horror films...
