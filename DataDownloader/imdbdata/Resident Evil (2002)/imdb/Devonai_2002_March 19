2002_March 19 

As a fan of the first three games, I had been following the smattering of
details of the movie's progress through production.  I totally forgot about
it for about a year, and the unanticipated trailer I saw on television had
me cheering out loud.  Even still, I kept my expectations low as I had for
previous video-game to movie conversions.<br /><br />I was blown away with the overall quality of the film.  The only negative
aspect was the ridiculous dialogue; the actors deserve credit for delivering
their lines with skill and grace.  For fans of the games this will be a
treat, but I doubt any of them need my opinion to decide or that there are
any of them left by now who haven't seen it anyway.  For those of you who
may not have any exposure to the games, the film with doubtlessly seem
overly contrived and unnatural in pace.  If the term &quot;survival horror&quot;
doesn't appeal to you, you might want to skip this one.<br /><br />Lastly, I found it humorous that a couple of the characters discarded their
firearms after depleting their ammo.  If they wanted to be true to the game,
they would have held onto them, hoping for the odd magazine lying in a
locker or drawer.
