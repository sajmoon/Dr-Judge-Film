Resident Evil is at least not like Tomb Raider when it comes to video games
made into movies: bad. While Resident Evil is scary, violent, and has some
great action sequences, I really did wish it stuck more to the first video
game, or at least not have put in the &quot;Red Queen&quot;. The movies does have its
little twists that will surprise you. One more flaw is that sometimes the
actors are actually trying to ACT. Those scenes are almost like watching
Battlefield Earth. Overall, I thought the movie is good and will most likely
buy it on DVD. The only people who may not like it are the Resident Evil
fanatics. I may be wrong, but that's how I see it.<br /><br />8/10
