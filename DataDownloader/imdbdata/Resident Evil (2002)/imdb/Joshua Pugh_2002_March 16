Never before have these words been more true.
After seeing the game-to-movie adaptation of RE, I left the theater feeling
uneasy, shaken, and for the first time in a long while, genuinely scared.
When I got home I decided to see if anyone else on this vast internet would
agree with me.  What I found has shocked me possibly more than the movie
did.
It seems as though everyone on the net thinks they're some high grade movie
buff.  All I'm seeing in regards to this movie is negative feedback.
That's
a funny thing considering all the RE shows at my local theater were sold
out
last night.
I think the problem is that everyone reviewing this movie is jaded by the
normal crop of touching, emotional, hoopty-blah that comes out every couple
months.  Critics are walking into this movie expecting the get the same
kind
of experience they got from 'We Were Soldiers', or 'Forrest Gump'.  I
honestly don't think critics can spot a good horror movie when they see one
anymore.
This movie grabs you right from the getgo.  Just when you think it's gonna
cheapen out and be not-so-gruesom (like most game movies), it hits you in
the face with 100 minutes of the most action packed scenes, INCREDIBLE
special effects, and enough gore and horror to keep you cringing at night.<br /><br />I will openly admit that I went to see this movie as a game fan.  I just
wanted to see how it transitioned.  I in NO WAY expected the movie
experience I got last night.  I give this movie, out of 5 stars, a big-ass
5.  If you haven't seen this movie, disregard the old critics who don't
like
a genuine scare, and get to your local movie house.
But as a side-caution, DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS!!!
