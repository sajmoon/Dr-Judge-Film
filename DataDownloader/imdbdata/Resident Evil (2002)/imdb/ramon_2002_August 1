i wasn&acute;t expecting to see a good movie at all when i decided to see
'resident evil' in the theaters, i think with myself, &quot;another movie
adaptation from video-game... that never works&quot;.
But not this time... particulary, this is the best video-game adaptation
i've ever seen. (or the only that really worked)<br /><br />8,5/10
