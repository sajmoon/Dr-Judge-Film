With no expectations or predjudice, I decided to watch the movie since I've
played the games. It turns out the movie was not to be shown locally in our
town, so me and my friends had to take the 1.5 hrs drive north to catch the
movie there. So we did and I must say it was really entertaining! Not really
like the game, but not letting game-fans down. The music is perfect for the
movie, even though I personally don't enjoy that genre of music that much,
it really fit. The gore is as always present, we love it and if you remember
all the times you jumped to the ceiling when you got scared from a zombie or
something else non-exciting creature jumping out... Yeah, you get those
skips here too.<br /><br />All in all, a really entertaining game, RE fan or not!
