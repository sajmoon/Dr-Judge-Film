When we think about movies that are based on video games, we think of
watchable movies like Tomb Raider and Mortal Kombat (and MK
Annihilation).
We think about good movies (but horrible adaptations) like Final Fantasy.
Most of all, we think about the crappiest movies to ever hit the big
screen
such as Super Mario Bros., Double Dragon, and Street Fighter. This
explains
why none of us expect Resident Evil to do justice to the game. How wrong
we
were.<br /><br />The adaptation was incredible. They don't use any of the characters from
the
game, but the story remains the same, basically. Milla Jovovich, the
Fifth
Element babe, teams up with the Fast and the Furious' Michelle Rodriguez
as
they try to escape an underground facility that's infested with zombies.
I'm
happy to say that the name of the corporation responsible is STILL
Umbrella.<br /><br />The zombies were VERY well done, as were the dogs and lickers(?). The
acting
was also very good. The movie changed a lot of things, but I respect the
fact that it kept the video game's story without filming the video game.
That's a very hard thing to do.<br /><br />In short, don't ignore this movie for fear that it won't do the video
game
justice. It is one of the few game-to-screen adaptations that
do.
