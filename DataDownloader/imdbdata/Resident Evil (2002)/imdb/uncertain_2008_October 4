What&#39;s unbelievable is what a flaming pile of dog crap this movie is.
It&#39;s hard to believe that something this horrendous could spawn two
sequels and that people - presumably with functioning brains - would
shell out hard-earned money to go see it. I&#39;m not going to go into any
specifics of the film; it&#39;s not even worth the effort. It&#39;s not just
because it&#39;s based on a video game, either.. The people who made Silent
Hill managed to do a decent enough job transitioning that video game to
the big screen.<br /><br />Resident Evil, nor neither of it&#39;s two sequels, has any redeeming
qualities whatsoever. If you want to sit down with a bucket of popcorn
and torture yourself with this garbage, let me recommend a full frontal
lobotomy first.
