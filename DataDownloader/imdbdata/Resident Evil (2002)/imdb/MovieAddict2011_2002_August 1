RESIDENT EVIL, was so much better than I expected. The movie itself was not
just a horror, but a thriller/action film as well. Great combination of
these traits, as well as great characters, special effects, plot
development, and just plain weirdness, make RESIDENT EVIL truly one of the
best horror films ever. I own the first Resident Evil game(got it used), and
never got real far, because I  got an XBOX around last year when it came
out, but now after this movie, I think I might just play the RESIDENT EVIL
game more again! The movie really does go along with game nicely. The plot
and characters aren't exactly all the same, but the basics are, and it's
almost that you'd expect the game came off the MOVIE, instead of vice-versa.
If you want a great horror, thriller, or action movie(or all three), rent
RESIDENT EVIL-I assure you that you won't be let down. 4/5
stars.<br /><br />NOTE: This movie is pretty gorey, so if you don't like gore, don't get it.
Then again, why would you get a horror/action movie if you don't like
gore?:)
