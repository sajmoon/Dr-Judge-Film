Resident Evil is a film that can be added to crappy video game movies. I
had
excepetions for the film because of the involement of Paul Anderson who
directed Mortal Kombat but boy was I wrong. The film moves along to slow,
the dialouge is trite and the action sequences are predciatable. The only
thing that saves this film is hottie Milla Jovovich and the visuals.
Jovoich
tries but even her acting can't save this film.
