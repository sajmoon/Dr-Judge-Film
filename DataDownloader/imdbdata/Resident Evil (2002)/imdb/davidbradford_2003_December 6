Resident Evil is a movie only a teenager could love...or an idiot.  Not
that
I'm comparing the two, but rather stating that being a member of one of
these two categories is required to enjoy this cinematic garbage.  I saw
RE
in the theater, but I don't remember hating it this much initially.  A
second viewing on DVD confirms, however, that this is not a good movie,
even
for a video game flick.  Its a little better than Super Mario Bros. and
about parallel with Mortal Kombat (another stinker).  It's probably more
fair to compare it with other zombie flicks.  As far as suspension of
disbelief goes in zombie movies, this one requires the most, whereas 28
Days
Later creates a more &quot;real world&quot; approach to the genre.  Just for the
record, 28 Days Later is a far superior movie, anyone who thinks different
must be insane, or at least is lacking a discriminating movie pallet.
Director Anderson does what he can with the concept, which is better left
on
your Playstation.  He includes the SWAT style team of commandos, the male
and female protagonists, the mansion, the labs, the dogs, the &quot;licker&quot; and
so on.  Understand that this is not a movie designed to be anything else
than a zombie/action thriller, so plot and character development are not
important.  Unfortunately, the action sequences and plot devices are so
goofy, how can you not laugh instead of being wowed.  Milla Jojovich
jumping
from a wall into dog-kicking action is incredibly silly, and a vicious
computer playing life or death games with its human prey ONLY works in a
video game.  It's ridiculous.  I would have preferred that the main
characters find a mad Wesker controlling the Hive instead of a nutty
hologram.  The best part of this movie is that quick shot of Milla's
breast,
not much else illicits any reaction other than, &quot;huh?&quot;  Maybe the sequel
will be better, but probably we'll see more of the same.
