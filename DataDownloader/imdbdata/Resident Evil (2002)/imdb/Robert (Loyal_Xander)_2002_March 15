When I saw trailers for this film they all drew attention to what some will
think or see as &quot;Matrix-like effects&quot; the 180-off-the-wall kicking the dog
scene, and the bullet trail scene. But really those are the only two
effects
in the film that have that &quot;style&quot; and really they don't. The kick was a
simple 180, slowed down. The film is great if you loved the games, and
could
be equally good if you didn't I suppose. I'm the former, and can say there
are SO many little things you'll notice. It doesn't rehash old plot from
the
games, it doesn't play like the games, it's fresh and new. The trailers do
NOT do the film justice, when I left the movie I was begging for a sequel
and of the mind that Capcom (R) should use the film as a basis for their
next game, it was that good. It might have even surpassed its source
material. The horror genre has been stale lately, and the video-game movie
genre has NEVER worked right, this could change BOTH of those. The irony is
I saw a trailer for Jason X at the screening, and that's just what I don't
want to see, and what Resident Evil is not. Here's hoping for a
sequel!
