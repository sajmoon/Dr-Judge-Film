I thought this might be one of those brainless action movies that I'm used
to watching.  Having this be one of the &quot;video game&quot; films didn't make me
expect much.  What a surprise!  The writing is excellent, especially for a
movie of this genre (horror action).  The acting was a tad cheesy with a
couple of the supporting cast, but overall, the acting was good.  Whoever
wrote the screenplay for this should get an award for doing an unbelievable
job with material that could have easily become bad.  The editing with the
flashbacks made this movie a pleasure to watch.  Well, lots of gore, too,
but it was partly a horror film.  Don't sell this flick short - you'll be in
for a pleasant shock.
