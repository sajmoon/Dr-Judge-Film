I have a confession: I&#39;ve never played any of the Resident Evil games.
But I have seen the movies and I love them. <br /><br />The story starts with a disgruntled employee of a illegal research
facility releasing a chemical virus through the ventilation system. All
the employees quickly die. Then we are introduced to a young woman
(Milla Jovovich) with amnesia who is somehow connected to the facility.
Suddenly a young man bursts into her home, followed by commandos who
are there to exterminate the employees who are now flesh-eating
zombies. <br /><br />I found the film to be exciting, scary and well made. Jovovich is very
good in the role of Alice, who discovers she has fighting skills that
come in handy when battling the undead. (I love the scene where she
climbs the wall and kicks the zombie dog in the head!) Be sure to pay
attention to all the &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; references. <br /><br />The audio commentary from the cast and crew on the DVD is entertaining.
Jovovich points out all of her nude scenes. She also mentions that the
American distributor wanted to change the voice of the little girl
(Michaela Dicker) who plays the Red Queen, but the American girl&#39;s
voice was too sexy for a little girl! <br /><br />All in all, a good Saturday night flick.
