Has the MPAA gotten so tough over the years that using the &quot;F-word&quot; 3 or 4
times will garner an R rating - because this sure wasn't rated R because of
the violence.  In all seriousness, Lord of the Rings has more violence and
it was PG-13.  I have never seen a horror movie like Resident Evil before,
where each and every time something violent happens the director cuts away
from the action.<br /><br />Perhaps my disappointment stems from having seen the George Romero zombie
trilogy, in particular Dawn of the Dead.  Paul Anderson also directed Event
Horizon, which pulled few punches when it came to violent imagery, so I
guess I thought I was in for an updated version of a good Romero zombie
flick.  But alas what made it onto the screen was 35 minutes of build-up to
entering the Hive, and then no pay-off.<br /><br />I won't go so far as to say that this movie is horrible, but I do hate it
when movie studios hedge their bets and aim for the middle.  Either make a
movie PG-13 which everyone will know going into not to expect anything, or
make a true horror movie for adult audiences.  What people don't want to
see
is some stilted compromise that plays off of an ultra-violent premise and
amounts to a PG-13 movie cloaked in an R rating.  I mean honestly, after
Romero created the genre, who ever saw a zombie flick with only one zombie
getting shot in the head?<br /><br />The movie does succeed in a decent (but perhaps overlong) set-up, and it
does set the stage for harrowing encounters and ultra-violent  zombie
confrontations - it's just that they never materialize.  I think horror
fans
will be bummed out when the lights come on in the theater, thinking that
another great opportunity was squandered in an attempt to make something
edgy into something palatable.  There is an obvious sequel set-up at the
end, and who knows if that will ever happen?  Maybe they'll try and spice
things up the next time around or maybe just more honest and go for a
PG.<br /><br />My rating 4/10, because the premise is cool, it was filmed with some flair,
and the visuals were decent.  It just could've been so much
more.<br /><br />
