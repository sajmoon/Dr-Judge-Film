The mere idea of watching a zombie film is enough to give me the creeps, not
because they are scary, but because every zombie film I've seen was bad and
dumb. But lucky for me that I am not prejudiced and decided, in spite of my
knowledge that there were zombies in this film, to watch it anyway. The
thing that makes this zombie flick a good one, is that there is not too much
emphasis on the zombies. They are there, but not all the time, because there
are bigger, meaner and more complicated things to worry about which have
been &#145;beautifully' engineered with computers and are quite
original.<br /><br />Other things that really made me enjoy this film, were the story, the acting
and the directing. The story is a pretty complicated one for a zombie film
and there are always a few surprises and enough tension to keep the film
thrilling and exciting. The fact that the film continues to do that is
mainly due to the good acting and the good directing, which we all know if
worse enough can screw up a potentially good film. This does not happen here
though. Mr.Anderson and his actors have (according to me) succeeded in
bringing the first good zombie film onto my TV screen.<br /><br />8 out of 10<br /><br />P.S. If you like Resident Evil, also try Anderson's EVENT HORIZON or
