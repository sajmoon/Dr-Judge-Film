I went openning night I was so hyped to see it since I saw the
trailer, and when the critics said awesome things about it I knew
this was gonna be good. I for one have played the video-games,
and love'em, so I had high hopes,but also doubt since Tomb
Raider came out, and M.K.2 stank. But my faith has been restored
in video-game movies after watching this movie. the story was
excellent , casting, directing, effects, set design, all top-notch. the
movie itself was scary as hell. seriously my heart was pounding
mad all through the movie. I urge you to see this movie its a
unique experience in the theaters. I also wanna point out its
ass-kickin soundtrack, its excellent. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!
