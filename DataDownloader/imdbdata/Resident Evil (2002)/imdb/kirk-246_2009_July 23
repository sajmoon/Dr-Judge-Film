&#x27;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&#x27; is my favorite movie in the series.If I had
a chance to see the 4th film, which was animated, then I would probably
like it better since it got a good score on IMDb.But anyway, I can&#x27;t
say that the first was as good as the second, but it still is a nice
piece of film.Fans of zombie movies and video games shouldn&#x27;t be
disappointed.What can a person not like about this film? Sure, it may
not be as good as &#x27;Dawn of the Dead&#x27;, but it&#x27;s still a zombie movie,
and a good one too.What the movie really needed was some gore.There was
a little blood, but I love to see a movie with people being torn apart
by zombies.Lucky for me, the 3rd film managed to fix that
problem.Bottom line: &#x27;Resident Evil&#x27; is a good zombie film with a
terrific performance by Mila Jovovich.The sequels are better, in my
opinion.
