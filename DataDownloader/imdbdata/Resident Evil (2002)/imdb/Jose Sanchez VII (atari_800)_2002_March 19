This movie had nothing that the video games staked their claim for -
suspense, storyline, and depth.  The characters were poorly developed,
using
only much-cliched memory flashbacks, the plot was very hokey, and the
atmosphere was totally wrong.  Also, the cast looked like lookalikes that
may have turned down roles in it: the squad leader (L. Fishbourne), the man
who had coffee spilled on him (D. Carver or E. Norton), the man put into
the
Nemesis program (B. Pitt/M. Wahlberg) and so on.  The worst movie made
since
Firestorm.
