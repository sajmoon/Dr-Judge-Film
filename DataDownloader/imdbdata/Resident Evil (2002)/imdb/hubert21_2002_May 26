I rated this 3/10 - the only thing worth watching here is Mila Jovovich.
Otherwise it  felt like a b-movie with a totally implausible plot and some
really lame lines that  make you cringe. The action was not particularly
satisfying either... Perhaps I just  wasn't in the mood for mindless action,
but I really didn't like this movie.
