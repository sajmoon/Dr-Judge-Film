This movie could have been sooo good if only...
I was looking forward to it considering i thought the games were brilliant
and scary... but the movie is so far from what made the games good its a
total failure.
Firstly the script was truely awful and thank god there are only a few
lines
in this movie or it would have been unbareable. The characters are largely
irrelavent which is a surprise when they have two great actress in this
movie (Jovovich &amp; Rodriguez) who are totally wasted. Frankly you dont care
if any of them survive.
When i heard that P Anderson was gonna direct this, i thought he would
make
it a fun simplistic pop-corn movie with a few jumps in it. however he
seems
to have overblown the story and made a movie that is so stale with
absolutely no horror in it.
The music in the games was classical and eerie, but the techno music in
the
movie is not right when you are trying to make a horror movie (if that was
Anderson's intention)- it plays more like something out of 'the matrix'
but
at a far lower quality.The intensity of the promotional trailers are
totally
missing from this film.
The less-than-special effects are a huge disappointment, and the 'licker'
monster thing is totally underused. The dogs were kinda good but the
martial
arts thing looked out of place and phoney.
What i liked about the movie was the bit with the lasers because it was
something new, and the beginning of the movie provided a good jolt into
the
film. the cinematography should also be commended as the sets are amazing.
But the best bit must be the end as it sets up a sequel (which i'm not
looking forward to now)kinda well.
Unfortunately, overall, this movie just doesnt cut it. i'm not sure what
it
wants to be making it feel disjointed, and it wasnt scary at all!!! Oh
well,
i guess video-game movies should always be approached with caution. Oh
well.
