almost just like comic book movies. Everyone has their own
interpretation of what they think the movie should be like and what
they really like about the games differs too. The things I like about
this movie is Milla, zombies, and guns. The things I don't like about
this movie is the story could have been better. The screenplay could
have been better. And especially the Lickers, they should have been
better. I'm really not really a big Licker fan, I would have rather
have seen Hunters instead. Either way, the lickers were a little weak,
but they definitely made an effort to improve the Lickers in the
sequel. I really don't like zombie dogs. You mean a zombie man cannot
run, but a dog can? Makes no sense. I understand this movie was also
made to set the stage for other future movies and sometimes I hate
that. I love for each movie to tell its own story without having to
worry about leaving something for later. The scene with the laser
security system was cool, reminded me of the cool scene in Ghost Ship.
This movie is okay to watch from time to time, but its really something
that I wont watch more than once every few months. I love zombie movies
but I have others that are better than this. I'm only half way through
the second RE, but once I am done, I will post my feelings on this too.
