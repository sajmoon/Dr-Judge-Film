i rented Resident Evil (RE) on dvd for $1 from the local non-chain video
store and was pleasantly surprised. given that it's based on a video game,
motifs, character development, themes, and symbolism were THANKFULLY
absent.
(taking two film classes at a time has truly ruined me.) so what i did
expect was action, gore, and suspense. and i got it. several scenes made
me
jump. lasers have never been more menacing. of course, milla shone and
michelle glowered. RE goes well with a thick comforter and a cozy couch in
a
pitch black room. if you've got time to get your analytical film buff
noses
out of the clouds, allow RE to tickle you with basic pleasures - skin
(minimal sex, apologies) and scares.
