For starters, I'm a huge fan of the Resident Evil games.  I heard about
this
film about 4 years ago, and I was really excited.  Finally...a movie about
my favourite video game.  Somewhere along the line while the film was
being
developed, word was released that the movie would contain all original
characters and no video game favourites.  This upset me, and I was sure
the
movie would bomb.<br /><br />Now, years later when the movie has actually been released, I am proud of
this movie.  The new characters were well done, and though the characters
themselves weren't really developed or in depth, they still managed to fit
in with the story and not make the movie a joke.  While the characters in
the film do not equal up to the characters in the game, you barely notice
character flaws as you are paying attention to the rest of the
movie.<br /><br />The special effects, while obviously not up to par with movies like Star
Wars, were convincing enough to enjoy them.  The zombies themselves looked
awesome, with enough gore to make them grotesque and the perfect look and
sounds to give them the perfect zombie feeling.  I have to admit, I was
really creeped out and at the same time excited when a character looks up
at
a vent, and all you hear is zombies moaning from another room.
Spectacular.<br /><br />All in all, this film is action packed, scary, retains some form of
comedy,
and is worth your time.  I saw a private screening, and I along with
others
were pleased with the film.  Great work...and it was a lot better than I
expected.
