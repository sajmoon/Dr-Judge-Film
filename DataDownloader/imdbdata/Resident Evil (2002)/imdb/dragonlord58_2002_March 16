The most surprising thing about this movie was that fact that it DIDN'T
suck. Actually, it's the best sci-fi horror flick I've ever
seen.<br /><br />I was expecting much less after seeing crap video game to big screen
translations such as... &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;. Unlike most
moviegoers, I am also a huge fan of all these video games, and seeing those
movies made me wonder what kind of crack someone had to be on to completely
ruin a (potentially) great thing.<br /><br />Resident Evil is the complete opposite. I went to see it with my
girlfriend,
who is also a fan of the Resident Evil games, and as soon as we saw the
&quot;Licker&quot; we just looked at each other and said 'SWEET'.<br /><br />There's enough jumps and unexpected surprises in this movie to keep anyone
satisfied, and every time this movie seems to be straying into cliche, it
turns 180 degrees into something unexpected.<br /><br />Kudos to you, Paul W.S. Anderson! Thank you for an amazing
movie!<br /><br />NOW WHERE'S THE SEQUEL?!?!
