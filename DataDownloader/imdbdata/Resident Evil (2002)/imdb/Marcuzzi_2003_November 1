2003_November 1 

When saw the first Resident Evil game, I thought it sucked, but that was
because I only saw a few snapshots of it. I started playing the game a few
weeks later, I loved everything, the story, the graphics, gameplay,
environment, everything ! Most important was how the game pulled you into
the Resident Evil world, creepy !... When Resident Evil II (game) came
out,
I played it 'till the end in one night... Same goes for the other RE
games... Then, the movie, I just hoped they followed the tag lines of the
games... and... They did ! Just beautiful to see the underground labs, the
umbrella squad working, the zombies... and, most important, the feeling
that
the games gave me while playing them, just giving in to the movie and
letting you think you're in Resident Evil world, just like the games
did.
Ofcourse you can only feel this way about the movie when you've played the
games. If you haven't played the games, and you like the movie, it's a
must
to go and play them now !
Go deeper into the Resident Evil world :)
Can't wait 'till the second movie comes out :)<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Marcus
