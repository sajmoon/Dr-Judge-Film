I loved this movie. I don't particularly like horror movies and I have
never played this game. I must say that from beginning to end I was
hooked. I loved the way it was shot and the casting though none of the
names were what I would consider big names. Michelle Rodriquez busts
out and nearly steals the show from Milla. She is tough as nails and
kicks butt but is still sexy as can be. Milla as Alice is just
fantastic and dead on. She is great as the innocent confused Alice who
can't remember who she is or what is going on. She sees these events
through the confused eyes of an innocent. Then as she remembers who she
is the transformation is great and she comes off like King Kong,
Godzilla, and Bruce Lee all in one. She looks great and she carries the
movie and has shown she is an excellent action heroine. Milla can do
anything.
