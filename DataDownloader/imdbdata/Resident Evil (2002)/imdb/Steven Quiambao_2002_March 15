2002_March 15 

I just came home from seeing this.<br /><br />This really surprised me. I've never been a fan of horror or action
movies.
I'm more of a drama person (my favorite 2001 movies are &quot;Gosford Park&quot; and
&quot;In The Bedroom&quot;).<br /><br />But for some reason this movie just really stuck with me. I was so into
this
movie from the beginning and it wouldn't let go of my fixation. I guess
its
the persistant action that kept me into it. Either that or the two hot
actresses hehehe.
