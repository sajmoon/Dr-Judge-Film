This was an excellent movie overall. Acting was superb, directing was
great,
and I liked how a bunch of the movie took place in dark areas. It was cool
to see the movie use some of the older tactics to scare people. There
seemed
like there would be more blood, but there wasn't really much overall. The
storyline got better and better and eventually yu realize everything that
happened. I though the ending was excellent. Of course, I will not tell
you
how it ends, because it is excellent. Now, where's the
sequel?
