I've played the games since the beginning, and has become one of my
favourites. So without a doubt this was going to be a film i wouldn't
have missed for the world.<br /><br />I felt that this film was true to the games, a few differences but one
wouldn't have been missed on film. (Who would want to see a door
opening every five seconds?) With a few jump out of your seat moments
and a ending that probably stands out more than the endings from the
games.<br /><br />Milla would have made a great Jill Valentine.<br /><br />Some have said it's the lab from the second game though not that
convinced. Barely looks like it.<br /><br />I personally became a big fan of Michelle since this film.<br /><br />The story was great and would make a great game too, I hope they do one
though.<br /><br />The main downside to it was that there's not much for the non-fans. So
if you haven't played the game you might want to give this a miss.<br /><br />10/10
