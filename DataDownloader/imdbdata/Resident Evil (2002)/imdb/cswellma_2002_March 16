I read all the reviews for this movie before I dragged my boyfriend with me
to go see this film. After reading the reviews, I got the notion that it
was
a great film for lovers of the genre, but lacked something to be desired
for
sci-fi/zombie movie loathers. Well, doesn't that assumption make sense?
Anyway, I'm not going to spoil the movie, just suffice it to say, I was
pleasantly surprised thinking it was going to be another mindless piece of
celluloid. It turned out to be a movie filled with a dreaded atmosphere,
and
a continuing sense of foreboding, and actual morals. I think my only
complaints about the film were the music (yes many other people had
reservations about it), and the fact that I wanted to see more at the end,
I
wanted to know what happened next. Now that can be either a deterrent, or
an
advantage. Here it's both because there's no real sense of closure, but you
actually care enough about the characters to want to know what happens next
(rare for a video game-turned film). Oh, and my boyfriend liked it too.
