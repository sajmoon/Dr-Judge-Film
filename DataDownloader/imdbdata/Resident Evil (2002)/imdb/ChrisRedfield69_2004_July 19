Resident Evil is one of my all time favorite movies, and is definitely
worth your time. Don't listen to the haters of this movie, they're just
mad because this isn't a carbon copy of their beloved video game. Paul
Anderson makes a wise choice here in branching off from the games,
because while the Resident Evil series works as a video game, it would
suck as a movie. The acting is pretty good as well. Milla Jovovich,
Eric Mabius, and Michelle Rodriguez do an excellent job, and the
zombies are extremely well choreographed. You will enjoy this movie if
you don't expect it to be an Oscar winning masterpiece. Its a fun romp
that should be remembered for its amazing action sequences, not its
less than profound plot.<br /><br />9/10
