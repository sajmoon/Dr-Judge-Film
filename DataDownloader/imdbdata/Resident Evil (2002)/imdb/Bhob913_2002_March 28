I am an avid player of the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; video game and I have to say
they did an excellent job making the movie from the games.  A lot of people
who play the games may be disappointed because the movie isn't 100% like
the
game.  Well all I have to say to that is &quot;GET OVER IT&quot;!  The movie was
fantastic and Milla Jovovich was terrific.  I hope enough people go and see
this so they will make a sequel.  I would be disappointed if people didn't
go and see this movie just because its based off a video game.  That would
be a mistake!!<br /><br />
