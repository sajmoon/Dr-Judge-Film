In a relentless non-stop action film like this....plot and
characters
are secondary to thrills and chills....of which this film is
loaded
with.Milla Jovovich kicks some serious butt....the movie although
not
entirely faithful to the game is an AMAZING adaptation that will
please
fans of the game and horror genre....this is the ONLY horror in
recent
years that actually had the audience jumping and SCREAMING and
laughing.
The ending pull back tracking shot was breathless and leaves it open
for
a sequel that should introduce NEMESIS?......this film was a
hodge-podge
of scenes and situations from other films in the zombie genre but
the
unique set design (The Red Queen's LASER and the sequence with the
DEVIL
DOGS were SPECTACULAR).entertaining edge of your seat thrills.....much
better and more satisfying than all those HIGH-Brow Academy AWARD
contenders
(Except for maybe AMELIE).CAN'T WAIT FOR THE DVD OF THIS ONE...or THE
SEQUEL....JILL VALENTINE should be introduced in that one and JENNIFER
ESPOSITO would be awesome as JILL...check out her audition
for the role in the lame movie the BACHELOR...she was SEXY and
TOUGH.
MILLA JOVOVICH and JENNIFER ESPOSITO.....that pair is worth any money to
see.Maybe even a subplot where Milla falls for JENNIFER...hmmmm!
They don't need men to save them.
