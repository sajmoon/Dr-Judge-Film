The lurid and misleading title aside, the whole point of this type of film
is to be thrilling.  Some thrillers try to be &quot;meaningful&quot; as well, with
perhaps a social or political &quot;message&quot; behind all the action, but this one
succeeds alright without such pretensions.  The basic premise is that
science, under the thumb of big business and government, has gone haywire,
followed by plenty of fast action, shocking scenes and bare legs.  There are
elements clearly drawn from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey,&quot; married up with hokum
from &quot;Night of the Living Dead,&quot; but with a few original twists here and
there.  It is probably not a film for those who like to think much, but
neither does it expect to be taken seriously.  For example, what
self-respecting female would feel properly dressed for a military action
without first troweling on enough mascara and lipstick to choke a
horse?
