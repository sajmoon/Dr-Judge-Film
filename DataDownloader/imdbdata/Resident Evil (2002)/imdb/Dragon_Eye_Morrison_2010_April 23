Paul WS Anderson, creator of such classics as Soldier, and Mortal
Kombat.....brings us a new entry in the Matrix franchise. This time Neo
is undercover as a female agent in a mansion, probably infested with
agents. Umbrella corporation is some sort of super duper pharmacy group
that controls half of the world. Are you a bad enough dude to endure
this awful mess of a movie?<br /><br />Oh wait, that&#x27;s not Neo, is that hot chick from the Fifth Element. Who
told her to get a lead role? In an action movie? Wait wait, action
movie? Sorry once more, seems that somebody gave some nerd with zero
creativity a bunch of money to shoot a matrix fan film, in a lab under
a mansion with zombies. Why? I have no idea, but the results aren&#x27;t
pretty.<br /><br />So, how do you mess up something as simple as making a fun zombie
movie? Follow the RE guideline:<br /><br />-Add a bunch of gimmicky, annoying and irritating camera angles,
matrix-esquire slow mo and other pointless stuff that never ever looks
&#x22;cool&#x22; at all. -Write a bunch of napkin-one-dimensional characters, all
of them interchangeable, and just kill like half of them before the
first act concludes. -Write stuff that doesn&#x27;t make sense, and is not
fun to follow, or interesting at all -Yeah dood totally use slipknot in
the soundtrack! That&#x27;s a great idea....if you&#x27;re 15 and wanting to make
your parents angry.<br /><br />There you go, the result is this insipid disaster, who is now on the
4th film. There is a market for this needless to say, but then again,
there is a market for people with a fetish for seeing women on the
internet stomping over eggs. At least the stomping is not in SLOOOOOOW
MOTION over and over....not that i know.
