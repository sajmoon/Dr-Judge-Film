As much as I enjoy high-brow cinema, I also have a soft spot in my heart for
shoot-em-up SF escapism.<br /><br />In my mind, &quot;Aliens&quot; from 1986 is still the best jump-off-your-seat SF
scarefest of recent history.  &quot;Resident Evil&quot; doesn't even come close to the
level of techno-thriller expertise of that older movie.<br /><br />BUT: Resident Evil is a lot of fun, and should please many zombie fans.  The
story is a treatment of the classic zombie formula: trap some unwitting
people in a closed system with flesh-eating dead people. Add some action
sequences, some people-muching gore, and a couple of motivation twists to
make it spicier, and you have the usual zombie stew.<br /><br />What makes this better than a C-movie Romero flick is the special effects
wizardry, and a little more character texture than most Saturday afternoon
zombie flicks.<br /><br />If you're looking for some fun B-movie escapism, and don't mind a couple of
slower scenes, then you should enjoy this flick.  I can't say I want to run
out and buy the video game now, but I certainly did get some good jumps and
good &quot;grosssssss...!&quot; factor from Resident Evil.<br /><br />3 stars out of 5.<br /><br />p.s. I thought &quot;Tremors&quot; and &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; were even more fun than
Resident Evil.<br /><br />
