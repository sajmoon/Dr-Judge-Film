This has to be the best zombie-mutant-shoot-'em-up-splatter-film
I've seen in years! It rocks, it rolls, it's lock and load entertainment
of the finest kind! And certainly not for the faint of heart or even
weak of stomach!<br /><br />Not having played the game, I can't comment on the film's
accuracy. But Resident Evil, unlike previous attempts to transfer
video games to the big screen, is a great action film in its own
right.<br /><br />The plot is very simple: A team of elite commandos is sent into an
underground laboratory to find out what caused the death of
several thousand employees. Of course, an evil corporation has
been evilly getting up to evil tricks and nasty things are lurking in
dark corners.<br /><br />Now forget the plot and fasten your seat belts as the elite team is
not only taken apart by some cool special effects but also finds
itself on the menu as hors d'oeurvres, entr&eacute;e and dessert for a
horde of ravening zombies, mutated Dobermanns with attitude
and a giant...thingy!<br /><br />Writer-director Paul W.S. Anderson pulls out all the stops as the
countdown ticks down and the bodycount steadily mounts. There
are moments that will make you jump and your pulse race, gunfire
aplenty, loads of narrow escapes and some great &quot;Oh ****!&quot;
moments; all to a pounding rock beat.<br /><br />There's more than enough blood and guts shown, figuratively as
well as on the floors, walls and ceiling, to satisfy all but the sickest
of individuals (Hi Susi!) and full credit goes to the prosthetics,
make-up and special effects departments.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich makes an excellent kick-zombie heroine (and I for
one, would volunteer to have my neck snapped like a dry twig
between her thighs anytime!) as does Michelle Rodriguez as one
of the troopers.<br /><br />Resident Evil is everything Tomb Raider should have been and
wasn't. If you've lost faith in ever seeing a video game successfully
make it to the big screen, you will believe again. If you won't see
this film because it's based on a video game, you will be missing
out in a big way. Overcome your prejudices, I did, and finally get
your money's worth from a trip to the cinema.<br /><br />Producer Bernd Eichinger's Constantin Film has recently had its
name attached to some very dubious offerings (All the Queens
Men, for example, or 666-Trau keinem mit wem du schl&auml;fst - trust
me, you do not want to know!). But with Resident Evil the company
is well and truly back on top of the game.<br /><br />Now where's the sequel??!!
