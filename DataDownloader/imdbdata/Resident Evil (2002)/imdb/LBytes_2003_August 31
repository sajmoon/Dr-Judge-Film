The soundtrack is the most attractive element of the movie. It fits the
screenplay very well. Jovovich is easy on the eyes and she has an
expressive
face that keeps you interested in her. The rest of the cast is fair to
good;
no crummy acting at least. Some settings are appropriately creepy. It does
run down into a 'kill all zombies' movie, the plot could've used a few
more
minutes developing the mostly fictional science, and there were some lack
of
continuity in the scene transitions. Still Resident Evil worth watching if
you don't mind blood and guts. I learned, for instance, never to stick my
head out of a stuck elevator. I'd give it a 7.5 here at IMDb if I could
but
I can't quite go to an 8 so it is a 7/10.
