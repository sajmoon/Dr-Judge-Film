The two main things about this movie that bothered me the most are as
follows:<br /><br />1:  They never established a sense of utter hopelessness.  In any Zombie
flick this is the key.  Zombies are dumb, clumsy, and slow.  The only way to
make them a true threat is to have your heroes in as small and unescapable
place as possible, and to have HORDES of zombies for miles and miles as far
as the eye can see.  It has to seem hopeless. While it was clear from the
start that at least 2/3 of the supposedly highly trained paramilitary team
was expendable, at no time was Milla Jovavich in any danger.  There are
scenes in this movie where five or six soldiers are being swarmed by
Zombies, and despite all their training and vast weaponry, they can do
little.  Then Ms. Jovavich, in her ripped up nightgown and with no weapons
at all, drops in on them and goes Bruce Lee for three minutes, and, there ya
go, no more Zombie threat. BULL!!<br /><br />2.  While they did seem to spend a decent amount on the special effects for
the zombies, the main Mutated Beast that comes at them in the end looked
like something Ray Harryhausen might have done for one of his movies in the
60's.  Which is not a slight to Mr. Harryhausen at all.  Clash of the Titans
and Jason and the Argonauts are two of my favorites, and a documentary on
Mr. Harryhausen put me in awe of his talents. But the claymation-like
movements of the Mutant in this movie really clashed with all the rest of
the high tech goings on.<br /><br />All in all, if you want a decent Zombie movie, go rent &quot;Night of the Living
Dead&quot; or &quot;Zombie&quot;, an unnoficial Italian sequel that came out before Mr.
Romero came out with &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;.  If you go with &quot;Resident Evil&quot;,
you will regret it before you finish the movie.
