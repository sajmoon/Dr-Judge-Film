It's been quite a while since I first heard of the Resident Evil movie. 
Back when George Romero was writing a script, and Samatha Mathis from Broken
Arrow was going to play Jill Valentine with Bruce Payne as Wesker, I was
excited.  Then things seemed to fall apart and the project was in my mind
trashed.<br /><br />Slowly things came back together.  A new writer, director, cast, and so on
help to bring my confidence back.  Even though the cast seemed to lack a
little bit, and the characters were not the same, I was still excited to see
the movie when it finally came out this past Friday.<br /><br />Although I understand this could not be considered a great movie, I was very
much satisfied with the transfer to film of one of the greatest video games
ever made.  I was disappointed with the changed characters, but the story
was very much there.  <br /><br />And the special effects and gore were excellent.  I was especially impressed
with the dogs in how closely they resembled what you see in the
game.<br /><br />Needless to say I was happy with the results, and look forward to the
sequel.  If it's anything like the video game series, it only gets
better.<br /><br />9/10
