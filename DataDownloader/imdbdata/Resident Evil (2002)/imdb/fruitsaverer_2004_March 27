Resident Evil is a slick and decent looking movie but it lacks a lot in
terms of scares and horror to make it worthy of the video games that spawn
it. Milla Jovovich and the cast do well with what is giving, and the movie
itself is a good late night movie to watch but it should have been a balls
to the wall horror feast that the games were. Of course like all
adaptations
of novels and games, it does not resemble its forefather in anyway, and it
does not retain the sense of terror that the game had in spades. The
zombies
don't look scary at all, and the hunter looks a fake as a plastic chew
toy.
Some scenes are good, and the special effects in some of them fit like a
glove but overall the movie is nothing more than a decent scary movie that
should have been a lot more than it was.
