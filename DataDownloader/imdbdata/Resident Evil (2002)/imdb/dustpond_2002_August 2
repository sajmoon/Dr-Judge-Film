This is a really good movie. I like it, action meet horror.<br /><br />They have really managed to live up to the quite high expectations I had
prior to watching this movie. I really like it.<br /><br />I don't want to comment on the content on the movie since then perhaps I
would ruin the movie for you other folks who hadn't seen it
yet.<br /><br />The casting is also good, the actors act and react the way I expected them
to.<br /><br />And finally, Milla always adds that nice spice to the movies she's
in.<br /><br />Great movie, a 9 on the richter scale. :)
