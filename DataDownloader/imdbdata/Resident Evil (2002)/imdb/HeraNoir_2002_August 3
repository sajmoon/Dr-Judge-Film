Not since the realease of Alien many many years ago has there been a horror
flick that gave me the &quot;Oh s**t&quot; reflex.
I was not expecting much since movies of this genre have been so
dissapointing to me in the past.  The video game to movie scene has not had
much success for me...ie Mortal Kombat.
There has been many failed attempts at horror films in the past, but I have
to say that not a one has made me yell at the television screen....&quot;Oh you
had better run faster than that!&quot; in a long time.  I wish I had seen this
one in the theatres, DVD on a small screen did not do it
justice.
This was not your typical Jason or Michael slashing at anything that moved.
It actually had a story line that kept my interest and attention.  The
story
made sense, I could see this happening in some day in age with all of the
genetic research going on.  Am I paranoid? Nope, not yet....the movie was
good but not that good.
Rent it, see it, you will love it.  Just be careful what you are grabbing
when that &quot;Oh s**t&quot; reflex kicks in.  You will understand grasshopper when
you see the movie.
