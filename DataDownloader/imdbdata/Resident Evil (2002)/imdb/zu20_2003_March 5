I was a bit of a fan of watching other people play this game - I don't
actually play computer games myself! so I had high expectations going into
this film and I am glad to say I wasn't dissapointed in the slightest - the
acting was quite impressive for a film of this type Eric Mabius was gorgeous
and I've always found the whole zombie thing terrifying so this was more
than scary enough for me.<br /><br />I did have a few minor quibbles about the plot in places and I kinda think
in places that in terms of making sense it doesn't stand up to a lot of
scrutiny but they are very pedantic points that didn't detract from my
general enjoyment. I can't say anything more about this film apart from the
fact that it entertained me for the whole time - I would recommend it and I
can't wait to see the sequel!
