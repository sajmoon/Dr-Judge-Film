Whether you've played the game or not, this movie is it!  There's nothing
like it!  The game was a classic for me.  If you are a fan of the game, you
might be a little disappointed with the slight twist in the plot and
different characters but believe you me, it doesn't take too long to get
hooked on to these characters.  And the blond chick, i don't even know her
name.  She was like whoa!  She rocks!<br /><br />This movie is the best guys.  I loved every moment of it! Amazing special
effects!  Also, just so the fans of the game know, its a mixture of
Resident
Evil 1 and 2.  They give you a kind of prelogue to Resident Evil 3: Nemesis
in the end which means that Nemesis is coming.  No mention of Code Veronica
yet!  But my God!  Spine chilling, interesting, x-filey like!  Full of
conspiracies and the hot chick!  A MUST see for all fans!  VERY
entertaining
for those who will get introduced to the idea for the first
time!
