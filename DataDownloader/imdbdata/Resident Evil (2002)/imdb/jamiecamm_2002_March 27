Before I saw this movie i thought it would just be gross and have no
story,
well was i wrong.  This film was great it not only had a great story it
also
spooked you with out having to show graphic details in blood and gore
unlike
night of the living dead and all other zombie movies.  The actors in the
movie were my favorite thing,  Milla Jovovich is awsome in this role and
so
is Michelle Rodriguez because there tough and know how to kick zombie
butt.
Also Eric Mabius was awsome in this movie.  I am just mostly upset on the
cool characters that are killed.
