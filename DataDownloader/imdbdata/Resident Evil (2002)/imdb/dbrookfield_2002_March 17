Okay, I went in knowing full well this would not be great cinema, but I was
just looking for a good time, some action, some Milla, and I was banking on
the fact that a couple of reviews said this was at least the best of the
&quot;game&quot; movies.<br /><br />False.  This movie makes Final Fantasy look like Shakespeare.  Bad, bad,
bad.  I was frightened exactly, umm, zero times.  This movie is entertaining
only in the same sense that Plan 9 From Outer Space is entertaining.  The
attempts at both horror and scifi were quite humorous at
times.<br /><br />Completely unabsorbing.  Occasionally I would be stirred to interest with
some development here or there, but it was all too brief.  Milla-wise, the
beginning has a flash of nipple.  If you hold out to the end you'll get a
near Basic Instinct moment.  In between you might want to go to the lobby
and check out some posters of upcoming movies.<br /><br />This movie would have benefited from some extensive rework on the story, the
storyboard and less clothes for Milla.  I mean, as long as you're going to
be gratuitous, you might as well do it right.<br /><br />
