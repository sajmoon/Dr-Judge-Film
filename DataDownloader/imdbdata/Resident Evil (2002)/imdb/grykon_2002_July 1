3rd day showing, I stood waiting on my brother to go in and watch the
movie.  An avid fan of the RE:games (well 1 and 2 at least), I had mixed
feelings of the movie.  Several countless nights in front of my computer
playing the game until early in the morning hours, the sound effects of the
games were so addicting.  They drew you into the game, until finally as the
house would cool from the days heat and a pop here or a crack there, and
suddenly you were looking around the room wondering if it was possible.<br /><br />So you can see my position on this, many movies have been made of
something that is in another medium, and gone so wrong from it.  And
usually
it is such a big flop that it never recovers.  RE the movie could have
suffered from the same effect, but in truth I think the movie came out
exceptionally well all things considered.  The movie was well scripted for
the genre, the characters were believable, the special effects were great.<br /><br />One thing I missed was the audible ambience of the game, to me that
made
the game.  Did it hurt the movie?  For the most part no, but would have
made
it better.  While my brother screamed for more bloodshed I found the level
of gore to be very acceptable, while the games were much more violent and
gore to gag a maggot, I don't see that kind of thing a plus, especially if
you want the movie to have a big enough drawing to warrant more movies, and
this movie I want more of!<br /><br />On a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 9.5 rating.  There could be some
improvements, but they aren't needed.  I believe the movie ended just as it
should have, and I am anxiously awaiting the sequel.
