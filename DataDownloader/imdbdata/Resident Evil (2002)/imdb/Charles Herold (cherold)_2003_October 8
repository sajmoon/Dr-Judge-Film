This movie means business. Quick disaster with a mystery to it, jarring
deaths, naked Milla, all in the first few minutes. It keeps up the pace
throughout. In terms of critical comments, yes, you don&#39;t really care
about the characters, but so what? How often do you really care about
the monster fodder in horror films? And true, it wasn&#39;t a literal
working of the movie, it didn&#39;t take place in a mansion and it didn&#39;t
involve exploring lots of rooms and solving puzzles. That&#39;s because
it&#39;s a movie. A literal translation of Resident Evil would probably be
really dull. Games and movies are very different mediums. I don&#39;t think
some people here understand that. One guy said he thought the movie
rocked but after repeated viewings he thought it sucked, and that&#39;s a
video game player attitude - movies don&#39;t have to have good replay
value, it&#39;s okay to enjoy them once. I only enjoyed Star Wars once, but
I don&#39;t think it sucked, it just didn&#39;t have a lot of depth. Not every
movie has to be Citizen Kane. <br /><br />It was an engaging story, moved like lightning and had some excellent
scares.
