I am sure that this would have been a much better film had George
Romero (Night of the Living Dead) signed on, but I don&#39;t take anything
away from Paul W.S. Anderson, who did a good job despite lack of
experience with zombies.<br /><br />I did a double feature last night to prepare for the third film in this
series. No, I haven&#39;t done video games since Pacman, so I had no idea
what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed Milla Jovovich
and, of course, am always happy to see Michelle Rodriguez.<br /><br />I have only come into zombies recently, so I was not aware that this
film brought the genre back after a long absence. It is to be praised
and revered for that, if nothing else.<br /><br />Now, in the next film, I hope there is a little more zombie and less
sci-fi.
