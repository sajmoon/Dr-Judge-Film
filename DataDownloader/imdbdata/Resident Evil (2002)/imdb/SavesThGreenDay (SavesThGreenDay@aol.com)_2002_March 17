When dealing with an adaption, no matter what the sorry (book, game, comic
etc), viewers have to expect SOME THINGS to be altered or changed. That
was
something I was having a great deal of trouble dealing with when preparing
myself for the flick. My biggest complaint going in was that this wasn't
going to be the eerie mansion horror survivor adaption that my Playstation
and I grew quite fond of, so I walked in very skeptic.<br /><br />The movie, to my surprise, started in the mansion and then advanced
forward
to the secret Umbrella Corp labs. and combined elements of all of the
games
into one movie. Throughout the movie, the acting as well as the diologue
is
inconsistant. When it's good, its really cool, but when it's bad, it's
laughable (ie when Michelle R.'s character says 'Poor B**tards'). While
not
trying to RELY on humor, there were a few good oneliners, though a few
should have been more polished and spread out. As a lover of the game
series, you can either love it or hate it. No, the first movie (yes, the
sequel is already being, if not finished, written) does not follow the
first
game with a dark mansion filled with traps, puzzles and creatures, but
rather the last fourth of the first game where you are underground in the
labs, searching for Chris (Milla and Eric are obvious representations of
Jill and Chris. Milla even dresses like Jill). After you let go of the
fact
that this is more like an amalgam, you being to appreciate this as an
alternate RE chapter with a few nods and references for fans of the games.
Any old horror fans will see this as a revamped, perhaps better version of
Romero's Day of the Dead (I would have loved to see his version of this).
All in all, with the faced past action, the somewhat intruiging plot,
stylish directing and well forged score, Resident Evil turns out to at
LEAST
be a very entertaining movie. Go for it.
