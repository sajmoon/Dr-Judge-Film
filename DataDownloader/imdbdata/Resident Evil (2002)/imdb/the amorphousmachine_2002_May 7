2002_May 7 

Nice introduction, very cool laser-beam scene and pretty darn good ending
does NOT make me appreciate 'Resident Evil' as one of the better films of
2002. Spoiled by silly characters who you didn't care about, music-video
style directing and action-sequences marred by choppy editing and
heavy-metal music all eventually got very annoying. The zombies were hardly
scary and not used effectively, the red queen was irritating and the mutant
zombie was wasted. It felt like a video-game movie, and that's what it is,
but 'Resident Evil' didn't become a zombie film in it's own right. Milla
Jovovich was good but her character was stupid, but Michelle Rodriguez takes
the cake for most annoying character award. Paul Anderson uses every cliche
in the horror film genre to try create suspense to the extent it got cheesy.
How can you be scared for characters that you couldn't care less about.
'Resident Evil' would get a lower mark, if it wasn't for the three saving
graces that I mentioned in the opening sentence.  **1/2 out of
*****
