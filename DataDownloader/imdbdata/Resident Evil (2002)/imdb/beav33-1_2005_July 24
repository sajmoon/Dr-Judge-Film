The first time I saw this film as a rental, it seemed pretty average.
After multiple viewings via cable (it seems to be a favorite on HBO),
my opinion has gone well up.<br /><br />The film does not necessarily have tons of scares, but plenty of
suspense and action. I've always believed that Anderson has done a
great job of creating isolation spaces, and this is no different.<br /><br />The acting is also decent, Michelle Rodriguez is not great, but let's
face it is great to look at. I like Eric Mabius quite a bit, and Milla
is as convincing as one might be with a supermodel kicking ass etc.<br /><br />All in all I'd recommend the film, however the sequel was another
matter.
