It does follow a futuristic sci fi action movie formula.  The characters
have been done before- on the team there's the 1. black guy who dies 2.
the
smart one who no one believes 3. the one who's been attacked already and
has
like a virus in them 4. the one who is cool with 2. but dies and 5. the
one
who no one likes cause the person is a bitch or an asshole.  The laser
things that cut people up are cool, and the Red Queen is weird and funny
cause she's a little British hologram girl.  It's a typical sci-fi movie,
but one of the more fun ones.
B-, 7/10
