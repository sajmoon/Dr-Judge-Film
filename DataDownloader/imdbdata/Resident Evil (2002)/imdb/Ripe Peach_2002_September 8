This movie is an hour and a half long and costs approximately a third as
much as the game.  The visuals and score are better than the game, but the
plot, dialogue, composition, lighting and camerawork are
worse.<br /><br />It's just occurred to me that a couple of generations of console or PC down
the line, when game visuals reach cinematic realism and we can have proper
virtual hotties, then there will be absolutely no reason why game developers
should put in any more work than filmmakers.<br /><br />Enjoy your quality 20+ hour games while you can, because the line between
game and film is getting narrower.  When they reach 1:1 comparison, games
will last (pro rata) approximately 4.5 hours, or they'll be sold as 1.5 hour
&quot;episodes&quot; for the same price as a DVD.<br /><br />Shudder.  I mean, Mila and Michelle are supremely hot, but I do like a
*little* dialogue and imagination in my entertainment.
