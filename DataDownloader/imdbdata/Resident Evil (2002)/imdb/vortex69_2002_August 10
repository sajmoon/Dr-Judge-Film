I enjoyed the movie, and i'm a fan of the games...
Good in the movie: The actors, the zombies, the guns, and it's Resident
Evil
:) The end of the movie looks like the intro of Resident Evil 3: Nemesis
(makes it look like there gonna be a Resident Evil 2 (movie)
Bad in the movie: Why didn't they used the names of real characters of the
game??
