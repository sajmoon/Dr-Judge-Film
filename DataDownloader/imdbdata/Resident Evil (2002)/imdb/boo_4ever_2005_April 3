2005_April 3 
I'm a fan of the Resident Evil vodkas. Because of that I was really
looking forward to the movie. I hear Romero wanted to do something
which stuck more faithfully to the plot of the games. That would have
been preferable to Andersons film but thats not to say this isn't still
enjoyable.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a virus which has the ability to reanimate
dead corpses and was used to develop hideous bioweapons. When the virus
escapes, the underground complex known as the Hive is sealed and a
special team is sent in to investigate.<br /><br />Andersons film is at first nothing like the game. The original took
place in a Mansion and there was no character called Alice at all who
is the principal character here. However there are enjoyable references
to the games such as the Licker creature which appeared in Resident
Evil 2 (VG) and stalks the cast throughout the film. There is also a
nice reference at the end to the Nemesis program which takes centre
stage in the second film and third game.<br /><br />Its not a startlingly original horror film, or a film which takes the
baton and refines a formula beyond what existed originally. But for
fans of the games it is an interesting and enjoyable film, and that was
what was intended more or less.
