I have seen Resident Evil yesterday in a Sneak Preview
here
in Vienna. I have to admit that R.E. is one of the most
shocking movies I have ever seen.
Brilliant sound effects and music.
From start to the end this movie is a rollercoaster ride for your
nerves.
If you like sci-fi horror movies, this is a must-see film!
