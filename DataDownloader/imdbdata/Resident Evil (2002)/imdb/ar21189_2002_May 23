Awesome!
This movie has everything! Although the movie is a complete different plot
than the video game, Anderson somehow ignored the classic &quot;Flesh-Eating
zombie&quot; picture, and developed a new breed of horror films.
This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat staring at the screen
with
your mouth open. After coming out of the theaters,I was
amazed.
This was not what I expected. A must buy!!!
Also a great score by Marilyn Manson. Looking for a great horror
movie?
Well this is it!!!!!!!!!!!!!
