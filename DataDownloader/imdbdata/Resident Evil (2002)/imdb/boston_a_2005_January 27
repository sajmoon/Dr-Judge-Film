truly one of the worst movies ever to effect the human consciousness.
it made no sense whatsoever. although the first 5 minutes were great
adrenaline pumping moments, it quickly lapsed into 60 minutes of ...
stupidity. sexy milla and cute brooklyn boxergirl pull of their worst
acting ever. i suppose the one positive aspect is that it bucks the
current trend of remaking cool comics into awful movies. (batman, ff,
cat woman, scoobie poo, and on and on and on) but now we have to endure
endless vid games remakes. well we had those dreadful carmen sandiego.
make it stop. please follywood, how about using creativity in your
creative industry. this movie is not worth the 10 line minimum. I'm
unwilling to waste my time on this review. although I'm glad to see an
overwhelming negative consensus.
