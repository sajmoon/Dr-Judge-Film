An attractive woman named Alice (Milla Jovovich) woke up from the
running shower, after being mysterious knocked-out by it. At first, she
doesn&#39;t seem to remember anything and including her name. Then a group
of professional trained commandos (Lead by Colin Solmon) breaks from
the large mansion, she lives in. Including an mysterious cop (Eric
Mabuis) is forced to go Alice and the soldiers break in an mysterious
underground laboratory called The Hive by the Umbrella Coporation from
the mansion. Which the corporation are involved with medical supply,
computer technology and others but they are also involved with illegal
experimentation. Which the team has also find another man (James
Purefoy), who also lost his memory. Earlier on that day, an mysterious
virus is been unleashed by killing many innocent people and it sealed
the working area by an high-tech intelligence computer called The Red
Queen (Voiced by Micheala Dicker). Once the team has turned off The Red
Queen, the room were sealed turned open... and the dead has died from
the virus returned to live by attack the group for warm human flesh.
The illegal experiment from Umbrella turned loose as well. But Alice
and the others has to escape before the underground laboratory closed
itself and becomes trapped underground.<br /><br />Written and Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (AVP Alien Vs Predator,
Event Horizon, Mortal Kombat) made an enjoyable horror film that mixes
science-fiction and action quite well. Anderson gets an decent cast
here, some of the performances from the actors are good. Although
Anderson&#39;s writing script is quiet heavy at times and it doesn&#39;t always
work (Especially the monster &quot;Licker&quot; could have used more work in the
CGI department) but Anderson knows how to set up action sequences and
moments of visual style are always been his best at film-making. This
survival horror flick is based on a hugely popular game from Capcom and
&quot;Resident Evil&quot; is one the best video game adaptations so far.<br /><br />In the Resurrected Edition on the DVD, &quot;Resident Evil&quot; is placed double
feature with the sequel &quot;Resident Evil:Apocalyspe&quot; on a two disc set.
DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an terrific
Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. It has bonus features on the second
disc but it&#39;s mostly on the sequel than the first feature. If you loved
this film, you could find 2002 Special Edition DVD or the Deluxe
Edition from 2004 with additional special features. &quot;Resident Evil&quot;
wasn&#39;t an huge success at the box office but it did well in Overseas
and especially with DVD Sales was enough to produced the sequels
&quot;Apocalyspe&quot; and &quot;Extinction&quot;. Die Hard fans of the video game and
especially those who loved Zombie movies will get an kick out of this
movie. Don&#39;t miss it. Good music score by Marco Beltrami (Scream
Trilogy, Hellboy, 3:10 to Yuma &quot;2007&quot;) and heavy metal rock
singer:Marilyn Manson. (****/*****).
