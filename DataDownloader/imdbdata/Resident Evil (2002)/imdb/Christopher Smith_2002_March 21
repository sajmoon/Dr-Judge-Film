2002_March 21 

I have never played any of the RESIDENT EVIL video games so I didn't really
want to see this movie. Then my friend told me that it was written and
directed by Paul Anderson [MORTAL KOMBAT, SOLDIER] and I suddenly had an
urge to see it since Paul Anderson has never made a bad movie [in my
opinion]. The reviews made this sound like an awful movie, but the truth is
it's one of the better movies of 2002 [so far]. There's tons of great action
sequences, lots of horror, and for this type of movie, there were
surprisingly good performances from Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, and
Eric Mabius. Even though it isn't a perfect movie, I'd still recommend
it.
