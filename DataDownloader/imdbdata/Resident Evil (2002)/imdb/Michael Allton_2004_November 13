No one makes a movie based on a video game and assumes that viewers
will be looking for something from Stanley Kubrick. Instead, one would
expect the film to reflect the style and excitement of the original
game, while bringing something more to the table.<br /><br />I am not a &quot;Resident Evil&quot; game player so I cannot discuss whether the
film was true to the spirit of the game. However, from what I've seen
of the game, I sure does look like a close match. I can certainly
express my complete enjoyment with the film.<br /><br />Even though some of the twists and turns are predictable, they're still
effective! You know the dead guy is going to open his eyes, yet it
still startles you! That's a credit to the mood created by the film
through effective lighting and sound, and outstanding costume and set
creation. Even though you're shown virtual schematics of the setting
repeatedly, the story takes you so quickly through the setting that you
can't keep up and you're left confused and bewildered as to where the
characters are, adding to the suspense.<br /><br />Milla was fantastic as the heroin. She was compelling and believable.<br /><br />Michael Allton - http://www.viking-tech.com
