I've never played any of the video games, and I'm not one for artsy-fartsy
stuff, so from an entertainment standpoint, this movie was superb.  Nonstop
thrills and frills.  With awesome special effects and a fantastic group of
actors, this movie is a must-see for all Resident Evil, horror and/or sci-fi
fans.<br /><br />The movie stars the lovely Milla Jovovich as Alice, a woman who was the
victim of short-term amnesia and was suddenly drafted into an odd and
unusual mission not meant for the-light-of-heart.<br /><br />Ms. Jovovich's co-star, the equally lovely Michelle Rodriguez as Rain, a
no-nonsense, hardened, gonna-kick-your-ass-if-you-look-at-me-wrong kind of
woman.  Armed with a machine gun, she was not about to let anything get in
her way.<br /><br />Together, along with a few other military agents and Matt, a man who is not
who he claims to be, they fight their way through Umbrella Corporation to
complete their mission and eventually to save their own
lives.<br /><br />All-in-all, this movie was fantastic.  Solely for its entertainment value, I
gave this movie 9 out of 10 stars.  It lost a point for being too short (a
movie like this should exceed 2 hrs, in my opinion) and for the way it let
me wanting more.  Definitely on my must-buy list.
