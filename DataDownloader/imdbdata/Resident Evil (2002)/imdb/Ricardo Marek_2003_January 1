Don't expect this movie to be a good movie.  I was expecting much more from
this movie, I felt disappointed from the movie.
a)The effects are nice
b)Acting is +/-, very predictable.
c)Got frustrated from the argument.
After the &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;( which is a &quot;must&quot; movie to see) I was
expecting more from Milla Jovovich.
In a single line, don't waste your time or money on this movie, It does not
deserve it.
