This is definetly the best video game turned movie I've ever seen!
Regardless of the video game plot, this movie stands alone as one hell of
an
action film.  From the soundtrack, to the badass characters, to the
plot...nothing disappoints!  Start to finish, I garauntee you'll never
lose
interest or not be scared to death!  I can't wait for this movie to come
out
on DVD, and being a girl, this is something your girlfriends *might*
enjoy.

Go See It Today, You WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!
