This has to be one of the most stunning, well done movies I have EVER
watched. I love the featurs in the film, they were simplying breathtaking.
Yeah sure some people might be disappointed that the characters dont
relate
to the game, but who cares? Why watch the same old story from before with
the same characters we already know a ton about? This new unique
characters
keep you hanging on whats gonig to happen next with the all important
T-Virus that all us gamers know about.<br /><br />The Actors deliver a stunning performance for a fairly decent casting job.
Michelle Rodriguez (Rain) and Milla Jovovich (Alice) are both awesome in
this film. But I really admired the performances by Martin Crewes (Kaplan)
and Eric Mabius (Matt). Martin Crewes should have a really good career in
front of him, and it looks as Eric will be back for the second film.
Besides
that you had James Purefoy who also had a decent performance. But The
Casting was just a little of how aweosme the film was.<br /><br />Now I'm not going to spoil the film for those of you who havent saw it so
I
really cant take about some of the kick ass things involved with the film.
Your going to hear alot of rememberable quotes from both the Red Queen,
Kaplan, and Michelle Rodriguez. I gave this movie a perfect 10, and I
wouldn't give many movies an 8 let alone a 10. But this movie really
deserved it. Paul Anderson is definatly a good director.<br /><br />Rent, Buy, What? You ask this qusetion, this movie is a definate must see.
I
bought the movie the second day it was out, after already watching it 2
times, and I've probably wasted the last week or two of my life away
watching this film over and over. Id say ive watched it a goo 20 times. So
even if you dont like the general thriller, this movie is for you. Its
packed with action as well and has a few &quot;scary jumps&quot; along the way! Go
Get
It Now!
