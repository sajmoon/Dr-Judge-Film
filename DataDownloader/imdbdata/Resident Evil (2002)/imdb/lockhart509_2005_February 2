There is an biological outbreak in a secret underground lab called the
Hive,Owned by the huge Umbrella Corporation, who run a large amount of
Raccoon City. The virus reanimates the dead as brutal zombies, and when
a special op team are sent into the quarantined Hive to assess what
happened and shut down the security system, they place themselves in
extremely bad danger. Joining them is Alice, a security guard whose job
it is to keep the Hive secret, who has lost her memory due to exposure
to nerve gas after the outbreak. The second best character is a brave,
sassy op nicknamed Rain. Watch the movie to see the story develop. It
is a must see!!
