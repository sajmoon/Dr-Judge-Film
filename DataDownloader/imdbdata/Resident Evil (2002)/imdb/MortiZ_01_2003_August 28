Overall &quot;Resident Evil&quot; is way above average as far as video-game to
silver
screen goes, however the movie itself only provides enough entertainment
to
cover you watching it maybe 2 or 3 times after that the movie becomes
kinda
boring.<br /><br />The first thing you'll notice about this movie (if you have played the
games, but also if you havn't) that this isn't scary, at all. It is an
action movie with a touch of gore now and again. There's a few cheap
thrills
which manage to make your heart jump for a second, but beyond that this
movie has more in common with something like &quot;Aliens&quot; than &quot;Night of the
Living Dead&quot;. The script is mediocre, better than Romero's but still
filled
with wasted potential. The acting again is mediocre. In places this movie
does get kinda stupid. The dog sequence comes to mind where she manages
to
kill 5 or 6 zombie dogs with one bullet each.<br /><br />The zombie sequences potential for some heavy action and gory scenes were
again wasted as 4 of the team going into the hive to find out what
happened
are killed straight away by the Red Queen which means the film has to be
more conservative with who lives and dies later on in the movie. Those
characters went to waste in my opinion. The use of the Red Queen in the
movie removes any horror elements remaining in the movie concerning the
unknown of exactly what has happened as the Red Queen explains it all.
There
is in fact little or no atmosphere maintained in the movie, no where do
you
feel anxious or claustrophobic , and by no means does this movie inspire
dread.<br /><br />All in all a below average action movie that tries to be something it
isn't
and disappointing for the game fans.
