There are movies that win acadamy awards, then there are movies that
entertain you for two hours non stop.  This is one of those movies.  I see
one new release every week and this is the best movie in a long time.  I
took it for what it was.  Im not video game geek who is going to point out
every little flaw but I am a fan of the game.  I spent the first 2 and a
half minutes wondering if Mila would get naked, score.  The second half
trying not to jump out of my seat even when I knew it was coming. and the
third half hoping Michele Rodriquez would be a part of the sequal.  I was
all in all entertained.
