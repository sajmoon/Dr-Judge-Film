OK I'm gonna write this short and simple to give you a review of the
movie haha rating 6/10 good things;mila was a great actor to use as the
main role,shes talented and beautiful,what she lacked was the character
she was given,she was like a all in one girl,like an agent from the
matrix or something,2nd good thing the dogs were done nicely,3rd thing
the licker?was done nicely to.bad things;them based movie mixture +
actual story = crap movie,why?,because you lead the viewers to believe
that this is a close way to tell the story again but thru a movie,this
one mistake was what totally screwed the movie over,it may have only
been 1 mistake but this mistake was such a big screw up that it drops
the quality of the movie,they would have had a better chance just
sticking to a fully theme based movie rather then trying to use there
ideas with the actually story to try to make a good movie.
