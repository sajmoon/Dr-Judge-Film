I'm a big fan of videogames in general, but I never liked the Resident
Evil
series because of the ridiculously bad controls, terrible voice acting and
story sequences, extremely silly puzzles and lack of realism (why can't I
just jump over the car blocking my path? Why can't I shoot open this
simple
locker with my shotgun? Why don't the people I meet stay with me to
increase
our odds of survival?) But I knew that RE the movie, being made by
Hollywood
people, had a pretty good chance of being good, since the premise of the
RE
movies is better suited for movies than that of other videogames. Hate
Hollywood all you want, mock their predictable plot twists and cliched
characters, but you haven't been exposed to the horror that is videogame
storylines and acting, written by some dorky twenty-something japanese
programmer who thinks he did a good job emulating american zombie
B-movies,
but bless his heart, has failed miserably. Ignorance is bliss, as they
say.<br /><br />The storyline is well-presented. Since at the beginning of the movie
Milla's
character is suffering from temporary memory loss, this gives the movie an
excuse to explain to you the how and why's. Basically, it's about a rescue
team trying to find out why the computer AI of an underground secret
military research facility has gone haywire and killed off everyone. I
won't
say any more, but trust me, it's good.<br /><br />It grips you from beginning to end because like I said, you're seeing
things
from Milla's perspective. It does a very good giving you the &quot;they/we're
all
gonna die!&quot; feeling. The action scenes are so-so, it's the ambiance that
makes the movie. The haunting soundtrack is one of the best I've ever
heard,
and complements the movie perfectly. Kudos to the composer.<br /><br />The exciting ending does a great job at making you want to know what will
happen next. Don't worry, it's not tacked on to make way for a sequel, it
actually falls in line with the rest of the movie. I didn't watch RE1 in
the
theaters because I thought it was gonna suck, but I'll be standing in line
at the ticket counter when RE2: Nemesis rolls around.<br /><br />8/10
