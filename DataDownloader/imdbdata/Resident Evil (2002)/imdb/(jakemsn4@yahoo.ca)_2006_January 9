many people say this movie is not deep, not intellectual, whereas
movies like The Matrix is. I loved The Matrix but I have to say that
Resident Evil is very much intellectual in a different way. How often
in life is it that our family members, friends, and relatives, seem
like zombies? In a way, this movie says more about humanity and says it
more realistically than The Matrix, because in this movie, the enemies
are other people, and often in life our enemies are other people,
sometimes the ones closest to us. Also, many times in life, a person
who is right about something (for example, the guy who thought the
earth was round when everyone else around him thought he was an idiot,
or the people who wanted to abolish racism when 99% of the people
around them were racist) may live in a society in which 90% of the
other people attack him for it. This is like the zombies attacking the
small group of main characters. The zombies are also very cruel, eating
other people, and isn't this similar to how many people are against
George Bush, but have absolutely no way of getting through to the
people who support Bush how wrong they are? Are the people who support
Bush, not like Zombies who have gone mad and cruel and flesh-eating,
and who we seem unable to stop? Are people who support Bush not very
blind and &quot;mutated&quot;, as those zombies in the movie were? Is Bush
himself not like the last monster in this movie, huge powerful and just
plain nasty? This movie is so representative of real life that it's
really just awesome. You may say, &quot;well, tons of other movies with
monsters aliens and vampires say the same thing&quot;, but you can say the
same for The Matrix. Dozens of movies before The Matrix have criticized
humanity in the same way The Matrix has, but The Matrix is special
because it does it SO MUCH BETTER than other movies had. Resident Evil
does the same in this area. Even though many movies in the past have
monsters and vampires, Resident Evil and its series is the first movie
(and movie series) which has as its basic premise the fact the thE
ENTIRE FREAKIN' TOWN has turned into monsters. And this is how it is in
real life in many ways. In previous movies, it was always where the
number of monsters was less than or equal to the number of survivors.
In this movie, 99% of the people in the setting are monsters. This is
different from The Matrix, where 99% of the people are blind, not
monsters who attack the the main characters. The rest are robots, and
these do attack the main characters, but they are robots not people so
this is actually less representative of real life in a way because it
implies that negative things in life may stem from objects foreign to
us (i.e. the robots), or may stem from ourselves (i.e. Neo in The
Matrix is often told by the Oracle how much influence he himself has),
but Resident Evil focuses on the fact that sometimes in life the
greatest negativity comes from the people around you who seem to not
only become blind like the people in The Matrix, but to have become
cruel and heartless and soulless.
