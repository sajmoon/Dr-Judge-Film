I wasn't particularly impressed. It was O.K.- I love Resident Evil anyway,
but I wished the movie had been better.<br /><br />The first part of the movie, Alice didn't seem to be acting. Except for
her
first line, Rain was my favorite character just because I think she's
related to one of my friends- and acts exactly like her...<br /><br />Er, anyway... with the laser scene I was highly confused by the lack of 1)
Science 2) Enormous pools of blood. There was no mention of the S.T.A.R.S
(except at the very end there was the S.T.A.R.S. emblem on the hood of
that
one car).<br /><br />The movie would have been better off with more classical-type music rather
than rock. Let's face it, pianos are ALWAYS creepier than guitars. I mean,
in the game, you would always get freaked out when you walked into a room
and the piano was joined by a screeching violin- and then all you could
see
was a shadow moving towards you... They needed a lot more of that in the
movie. I'm not saying the rock wasn't cool- but they should have saved
that
exclusively for the soundtrack if they HAD to have it at
all.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the last parts of the movie- fight with the licker
(probably needed more blood, but whatever), then Matt getting taken away-
and you know in the second movie he's gonna be the Nemesis *happiness*. I
really want to see the whole city of Raccoon story. It needs to be more
closely based on the events in the 2nd game. That would make me so happy I
would probably cry... (but you know that won't happen because they're
against me.)<br /><br />My friends and I agreed that if we had enough money/resources, we could
make
a MUCH better Resident Evil movie. But since we don't, we'll just go see
the
next movie this fall.
