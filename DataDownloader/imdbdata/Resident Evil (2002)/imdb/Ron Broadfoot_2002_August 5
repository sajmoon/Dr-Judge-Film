I must admit that I've never played any of the Resident Evil games, but I
can only hope that they are better than this turkey.  I rented it expecting
to gain some scientific knowledge or that it would have some redeeming
qualities, but this is not the case.  All they do is kill zombies and
nothing else.  The film is really nothing more but a ripoff of Night of The
Living Dead.
