The good:
-Good fight sequences
-Great Score
-Faithful to not just the first game but also incorporates
elements
from RE2 and RE3:Nemesis
-I loved Milla she was perfect as the heroine
-Good camera work. Had some nice cuts and contrast
-Good sense of atmosphere
-I liked the computer and the &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; parallels.<br /><br />The bad:
-Mood would have been even better if they had a little less music. Nothing
is more suspenseful than silence.
-As a previous reviewer said &quot;they cut away from all the extreme gorey
scenes&quot;. This needed to be done for an &quot;R&quot; rating but I hope they put it
on
DVD uncut.<br /><br />The ugly:
-The box office asking me for I.D. to see a rated &quot;R&quot; movie(I am 26 years
old) I missed first 10 minutes from the hold-up caused by this policy to
everyone else in line.
-All of the reviewers on this site who use the same old tired arguments
against this movie:
e.g.
--it is an &quot;Aliens&quot; rip-off! (&quot;Aliens&quot; didn't invent the war/action
movie,
and why does no one have trouble with the fact that &quot;Aliens&quot; itself
totally
robbed Heinlein's &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; with NO credit. given!
--it is a &quot;Matrix&quot; rip-off! (Again, &quot;Matrix&quot; only pioneered the &quot;camera
rotation&quot; effect. The bullet effects were done in &quot;Blade&quot;
first(pre-Matrix)
or even in &quot;Firestarter&quot; (pre-Blade). The karate moves(wall kick-off) were
done in &quot;kung fu&quot; movies for years and also by this director in &quot;Mortal
Kombat&quot; first. The karate/action by &quot;leather-clad&quot;
protagonists set to blaring techno music was also done by &quot;Blade&quot;
before
&quot;Matrix&quot;. So ends this &quot;Matrix rip-off&quot; argument.
--it is a &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; rip-off! (Well duh! Find me
ANY
zombie flick that isn't. Yes, this incorporates the CONCEPT of &quot;Night of
the
Living Dead&quot; or should I say Matheson's &quot;I am Legend&quot;, but not the same
story. This concept has just become an ingredient to any movie dealing
with
this subject matter, it will never be &quot;new&quot;.)<br /><br />Summation:
This is a decent horror/suspense movie that could have been better but is
&quot;O.K.&quot; as is. It is just a movie.
