2002_April 14 

I have a friend who when we watch movies, he refuses to watch horror
films because they unnecessarily scare him. Yet,the only video game he
seems
to enjoy playing is RESIDENT EVIL. He still has yet to explain that stroke
of contradiction to me. Then again,this is someone who once told me he
doesn't wear a safety belt because he is not afraid of dying,but once when
I
wanted him to go skydiving with me, he turned me down flat because he said
he is afraid of heights. Maybe his logic is that he likes to be in control
of a situation if he is going to be afraid of one. I on the other hand,am
not a huge fan of video games. At least playing them. These days the
graphics and sound are so advanced that I find myself watching them rather
than wanting to play them. I do however love watching horror flicks.
Surely
there could be some sort of horror movie that I could take him to see.
Instead of just waiting for a follow up to his favorite game, he found out
that it was coming to the big screen and he wanted to see it. Being the
hit
video game that it was,it came as no surprise that a movie version of
RESIDENT EVIL would be highly anticipated. Almost everyone would agree
that
movies based on popular game franchises are not a successful investment.
RESIDENT EVIL is clearly the exception to the rule only because its source
material already borrows from a popular horror genre. The right director
is
employed to make the movie work. While Paul Anderson(MORTAL KOMBAT,EVENT
HORIZON)will not give you a subtle, thought provoking film in the vain of
MAGNOLIA director P.T. Anderson, he doesn't adopt P.T. Barnum's &quot;there is
a
sucker born every minute&quot; school of thought either. The film is well aware
of its George Romero zombie roots. It pays homage to it while staying
close
to the plot similarities of the video game. RESIDENT EVIL takes place
mostly
in the hi-tech underground facility of Racoon City. The evil Umbrella
Corporation has a monopoly on all the world's technologies including
nuclear,biological and chemical weaponry. Is this supposed to be a sendup
of
the Phillip Morris companies? Anyhow, the film wastes no time cranking the
action level into full throttle. A saboteur in the research and
development
department meticulously unleashes a deadly virus(in an opening shot
similar
to the one seen in HANNIBAL) that will annihilate those exposed and turn
them into blood thirsty zombies. The facility goes into automatic lockdown
and all Hades breaks loose. Enter the super slick response team set up for
failure from the word go. The &quot;Hive&quot; is controlled by a HAL 9000-like
supercomputer to keep them from getting out. Milla Jovovich(THE FIFTH
ELEMENT,THE MESSENGER) and Michelle Rodriguez(THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS)are
the heroines who get to do most of the bloody work. sLiPkNoT,Mudvayne and
Marilyn Manson,artists who seem to make most of their money playing on
soundtracks of horror movies rather than on the radio are on the
soundtrack
of this one too. RESIDENT EVIL is a fun, in-your-face and ghoulish action
pic. Whether you have heard of the video game or not,if you are expecting
a
fast paced frenzy accessorized by the lush color that blood will provide
than this may be your cup of Joe.
