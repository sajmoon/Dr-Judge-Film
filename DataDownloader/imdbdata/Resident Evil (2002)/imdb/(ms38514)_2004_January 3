It was a disgrace to the games. The direction was crap Anderson is lazy
instead of relying on suspense and atmosphere he relies on poorly executed
jumps scares and you don't jump because your scared you jump because they
amp the music up so loud you cant help it. There was not one genuine scare
in the movie because you don't care about any of the characters they are
all
badly written clich&eacute;s. The action was boring and stupid there was one real
battle with the zombies and in it they just kept shooting them in the
chest
magazine after magazine in the chest I thought they were supposed to be
special ops a highly trained military force and not a bunch of idiots. The
scene were the lead character (who Paul Anderson for some reason thought
would be a good idea to put into a tight red dress for the entire movie
for
no reason) jumps of the wall and kicks the dog was laughable as was most
of
the movie. Anderson Should be banned from film making all his movies are
(in
my opinion) unoriginal cheesy and stupid.
