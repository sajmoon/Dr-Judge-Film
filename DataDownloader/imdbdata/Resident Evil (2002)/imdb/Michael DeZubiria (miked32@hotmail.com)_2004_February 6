2004_February 6 

So obviously I make no secret of the fact that I've never played the video
game on which this movie is based, although I can't say it's that easy to
come up with what the objective of a game would be that would inspire a
movie like this. Not that I hated the movie or anything, but I think the
story here would work better as a game than it does as a movie. First of
all, the foundation of the story as a whole is based on a gigantic
fallacy,
or a series of gigantic fallacies. Specifically, the poisonous gas in the
movie that basically reanimates dead people, turning them into
flesh-eating
zombies, supposedly works because, as it's explained in the movie, the
body
is still active even after death (`for months,' one character explains).<br /><br />The problem here is that, while it's true that it is a widely accepted
myth
that hair and fingernails continue to grow after death (also mentioned in
the movie), it is not true at all that hair and fingernails continue to
grow
after death, it just doesn't happen. There is, in fact, a recognized
postmortem lengthening of hair and fingernails, but it's not because
they're
growing, it's because the dead skin is receding, revealing the hair and
fingernail material that was previously underneath the skin. So in a
sense,
hair and fingernails do, in fact, grow after death, but it is a result of
the decay of the body, not in any way a product of still-functioning hair
follicles and whatever the glands are that produce fingernails. Another
reason that the movie gives for the ability of the gas to bring dead
people
back to life is that cells continue to reproduce after death. This may be
true, but it would certainly never happen at the level required for a
cadaver to be operational enough to be a zombie. Cells that have no
incoming
source of oxygen have a remarkably short shelf-life.<br /><br />So now that I've unnecessarily pointed out that logic has no place in this
movie, I might as well point out that, for a horror film, the chronology
of
the plot is remarkably well thought out. I like that it starts with a
couple
elite agents who have lost their memories of what they have been doing and
why they find themselves at the places where they wake up. Milla Jovovich
plays one of these officers, and the other is supposedly her tactical
boyfriend/husband is a life that she can't remember. As the film goes on
and
the cast find themselves deeper and deeper within this underground lab
called The hive (and more and more surrounded by the living dead), their
memories gradually come back and they realize their old jobs, motives,
etc.<br /><br />As far as plot, that is very original for a horror film, especially one
involving zombies. You think of a movie that is centered around a gas that
turns dead people into cannibalistic zombies and you immediately pretty
much
know how the whole movie is going to go. In Resident Evil, however, the
majority of the tension comes not necessarily from the walking dead that
are
trying to eat the cast, but ultimately more from the awakening memories of
certain characters who find themselves to be enemies, turning guns on each
other even while the dead pound on the doors trying to sink their teeth
into
their flesh.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, that's another thing. Not only does this gas reanimate the
dead by utilizing the fictional continuation of bodily function after
death,
but once turned into zombies, they have the ability to turn others into
zombies with the slightest scratch or bite. So not only does this gas turn
dead people into cannibal zombies, but cannibal VAMPIRE zombies. If they
bite you you turn into one of them. No wonder they came up with the idea
of
internal strife as a way to create more tension, because the original
premise of the effects of this gas are pretty ridiculous. It was created
for
military use, although I can't imagine a military use for a gas that, when
used, would turn entire populations into walking dead, turning entire
cities
into the disaster that we see in the final shot of the film. Entire
continents and, ultimately, the human race would be wiped out with a
single
use of such a weapon.<br /><br />Michelle Rodriguez takes on exactly the same role that she played in the
ridiculous movie The Fast and the Furious as well as the somewhat less
ridiculous S.W.A.T. She always plays a very impressive, very tough role,
but
her half-lidded tough-girl routine gets real old real quick. Milla
Jovovich
is just as staggeringly beautiful as ever, yet taking on another role that
is fathoms below her ability, and really the rest of the cast kind of
blends
together, with no one standing out as important or with much of an
impressive performance.<br /><br />Getting back to the story, like I said above, it's actually pretty
impressive conceptually, but then again you have to overlook such
forehead-slappers as the machine coming to life (embodied, for some
reason,
in the voice of a little British girl), becoming self-aware, and trying to
terminate the people there to shut her down. She apparently has managed to
create a gigantic monster out of some sort of organic material the source
of
which escaped me, as well as whole herds of dogs that seem to have no skin
and no other purpose for existing than to attack anything that moves.
Cleverly animated, but certainly one of the things that raised a few
eyebrows as to where they came from or what was the point.<br /><br />Recently I've been seeing previews at the movies for a Resident Evil 2,
which is most of the reason that I went back and watched this one. Based
on
the fact that this movie ends with a shot that is also seen in the trailer
for part 2, the shot with Alice (Jovovich) emerging from a manhole to find
the entire city in a state of complete destruction, the gas having
infected
the population above ground, I assume that part 2 takes place in an
above-ground setting. I also like that the preview starts off looking like
an advertisement for some sort of beauty product, which leads me to
believe
that maybe that will be something that the dead use to cover up their
deformities and the fact that they are dead, thus allowing them to sneak
up
on the living. Although if that happens, it would refute the claim made in
this movie that they have no cognitive function other than the primal
instinct to feed.<br /><br />At any rate, a fresh new setting, above-ground, would provide a whole
array
of new possibilities for a sequel to this movie. In fact, in order to save
money, sort of kill two birds with one stone, they might even be able to
double their profits by calling the next movie something like `Resident
Evil: 28 Days Later.'
