I was hoping it would be creepier than it was. But as a few other posters
already pointed out- the director is not very good at creating suspenseful
situations or characters you care about. I agree with another poster who
said that the editing was really disjointed. Characters appear in places,
and you don't know how they got there. There are some plot holes as well,
i.e. why was the &quot;cop&quot; there to begin with? How did he know about the
mansion? I knew this movie wasn't going to be a work of art or anything. I
knew plot and all that were not that important, but at least it could have
been scary.
