Does everyone like this film???? I mean, I enjoyed playing the game and
decided to give this movie a try even tho most remakes of computer games
to
date have left me pretty bored, and this is definitely no exception.
There's
just nothing remotely scary or creepy about this film, the cgi zombies
are
annoying and poorly made compared to Savini's brilliant Dawn of the Dead
zombies or Fulci's rotting, maggot crawling cadavers. It may be a lot
faster
than the earlier zombie movies and it may look more expensive, but why
does
anyone think it's a good idea to let slick, middle-of-the-road action
replace genuine atmos (like in City of the Living Dead, Night of the
Living
Dead) or funny satire (Like Dawn), tho it may be involuntarily funny on
some
sorta kitsch/camp level that I personally won't stoop to. Come on, 28
Days
Later has this one beaten by a mile (actually leaves it standing on the
starting line). If you have to work for a living I suggest you spend your
hard-earned cash on something (anything really) other than this total
waste
of everyone's time.<br /><br />Oh well, should stop ranting now, you probably all get the point, so over
and out from me.<br /><br />
