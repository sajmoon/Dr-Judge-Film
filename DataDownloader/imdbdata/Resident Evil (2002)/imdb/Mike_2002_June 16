This is spot on! It links in with the games brilliantly, has great action,
great adult theme, great acting and a great music score. Milla Jovovich is
great and so are the other cast members giving their all throughout the
film! It even has a decent plot which other video game movies have lacked in
the past (ie.Tomb Raider). This is definetly better than Tomb Raider (which
I still loved!) and a whole lot better than Final Fantasy: The Spirits
Within (which was...ok). I really hope they make a sequel because they've
left the movie at such a cool cliffhanger!! I only wish they'd have made as
much effort with Final Fantasy.  I can't wait to buy RES-EVIL on DVD and
enjoy it even more!  10 out of 10!
