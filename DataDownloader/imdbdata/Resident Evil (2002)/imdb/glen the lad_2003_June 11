Havent played any of the games so had no extra reason to watch other why i'd
normally watch a film. First off I knew that 'Rain'(Michelle Rodriguez)
would annoy the feet off me with that dumb mean look she feel she must have
on her face and was waiting for it getting ripped off. Second I wish Colin
Salmon had more of a role as he just out shined everyone on with him that
moment with his strong voice and presence also it's nice to see a black man
in a movie these days that isn't all &quot;yo yo big it up da bong me boy&quot;
7/10
