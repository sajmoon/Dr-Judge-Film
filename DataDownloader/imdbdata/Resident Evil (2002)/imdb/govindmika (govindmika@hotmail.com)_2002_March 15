Resident evil fans..uve gotta watch this..Its even better for ppl who
havent
played the game. Not a minute is boring and the special effects are simply
out of this world. Its got great casting and the background score was
eerie..haunting..electrifying..Certainly a movie worth a watch..10 on 10
for
sure..You cant miss this one for the world!
