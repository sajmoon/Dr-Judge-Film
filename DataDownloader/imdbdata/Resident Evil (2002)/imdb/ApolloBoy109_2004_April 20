Paul SW Anderson's script for resident Evil was wonderful and I rushed out
to
rent the movie. I was heart broken when certain things didn't make
it
into the final film.<br /><br />Overall good -- though not as gory or suspenseful as I thought it should be,
and
I am not a gory and action kind-of-guy either. <br /><br />Killing the Red Queen so early and not having the scene where she
helps
them find the secret passageway to safety while the beast is on their
tails
wasn't wise.  I missed the White Queen also. And the many references in
the
script regarding the Alice in Wonderland were reduced to a white rabbit
and
the Red Queen herself. She didn't even look in the garden to see
the
characters from the story (i.e. Mad Hatter etc.) And there was no chess
board
microchip.<br /><br />The film did seem disjointed -- probably because the Producers chopped
up
his film. I gather he didn't have final cut and it shows.  Spence and
Alice
also seemed to have had scenes removed. And JD and Rain's
roles
were reversed from the original script.<br /><br />I don't want to sound down -- I really liked the script, and the film and I
will 
be looking for the game as well.<br /><br />
