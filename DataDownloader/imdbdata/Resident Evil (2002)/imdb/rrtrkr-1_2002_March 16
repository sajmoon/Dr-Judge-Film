2002_March 16 

ever since i played the game i thought wow this would make a great
movie
and for some time I waited and so when it was done Of courseI was in the
line of the opening day with a sell out show.This movie was really done
well!the acting was great,the directing was great,theeffects were good,the
scrip was good and it was so good that even though it was inevitable I
wanted them to all escape.tHOUGH I SAY THIS A FEW OF THE TIMES I DISAGREE
WITH SOME CRITICS INCLUDING ROGER  EBERT WHO GAVE IT A ONE *..DONT LISTEN
TO
THE CRITICS THEY LIKE THINGS LIKE A BEAUTIFUL MIND AND CROUCHING TIGER.At
the end of the movie every one got up and cheered applauding it.At least we
know where the NEMISES COMES FROM!
