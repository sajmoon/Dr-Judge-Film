A virus is purposely leaked in a subterranean complex known as the
&quot;Hive.&quot; A computer, called the Red Queen, shuts off the complex and
kills everyone in it. The virus brings the dead back to life as
flesh-eating zombies lying in wait as a group of military police and
one other break in to shut the computer down and restore order if
possible. The plot of this film is very complex and muddled. Throw in
some unrealistic action scenes, bad dialog, and some poor actors and
you have the heart of Resident Evil. I have totally no familiarity with
the video game, and I think this movie travels very little from the
mindset of that venue. The film definitely has a nice look to it. The
special effects are good as well, but the action driven plot moves way
too quickly for the viewer to internalize the story and get to know the
characters. The most interesting characters die very quickly and soon
we are left with clich&eacute;-drawn actors that flip up walls and use leg
kicks to the zombie's heads. The &quot;witty&quot; reparte between characters is
so hackneyed and ridiculous that we get lines like &quot;when I get out of
here I am going to get laid.&quot; The line is said by a woman having had
her hand bitten into and just hearing that anyone that even had a
scratch from the dead would turn into the same. Michelle Rodriguez
played this role with NO conviction at all. Milla Jovovitch gives her
typically blank face performance as the female lead bouncing up walls
and performing one &quot;kick-ass&quot; stunt after another. Ho...Hum. Director
Paul Anderson does have some flair for directing and some scenes are
particularly well choreographed (the scene with the laser I thought was
quite innovative). If you are out looking for a film with lots of
action, lots of blood, and lots of special effects like giant mutated
dogs and some creature with a big tongue, not to mention the hordes of
dead, and have little need of a coherent plot, decent acting, and
sparkling, crisp dialog - not to mention some good old-fashioned common
sense - then I recommend Resident Evil.
