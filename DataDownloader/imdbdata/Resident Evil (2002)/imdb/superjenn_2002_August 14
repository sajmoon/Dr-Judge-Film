Resident Evil is not a horror film.  It is a zombie flick.  And it is based
on the intriguing idea behind a video game.<br /><br />With this in mind, I rented the movie with my best friend.  After hours of
having sat behind my boyfriend in boredom while he played Resident Evil on
Dreamcast, I wasn't expecting much.  However, as several other reviewers
have said, this was a welcome surprise.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich is more than adequate as a heroine, and the plot thickens as
is appropriate for an action flick.  What works in the movie's favor is that
it actually feels like a video game.  There is atmosphere and pressure,
thumping climactic music, zero character development, dialogue pared down to
the essentials, lots of shooting, lots of action, lots of locations, lots of
zombies... all the comforts of Playstation, without having to move your
thumb!<br /><br />What genuinely moved me was the direction of this movie.  The truly artful
aspects of cinematography, sound, music, atmosphere, mist, slow pans...
everything contributed to the sensory experience.  Nice job.  It's not
Mozart, but it'll do.  Break out the popcorn.
