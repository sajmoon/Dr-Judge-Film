I had to admit that I was a bit concerned about the whole super-computer
element of the script, but I think that the movie came off rather
nicely.<br /><br />The movie does deviate a bit from the games. However, I don't think that
fans of the game will be disappointed with what they see. Many of the
major
&quot;dead&quot; characters are in the movie. I generally like the set of (living)
characters. However, Michelle Rodriquez is _very_ one-dimensional as the
pouty
I-got-beat-up-by-my-older-brothers-a-lot-and-if-you-mess-with-me-I'll-teach-
you-the-meaning-of-the-word-pain
soldier. I liked Milla's character a lot, and I think Milla does a great
job.<br /><br />The movie is usually very claustrophobic which I think is one reason I
really liked it. Anderson makes great use of cluttered closed-in spaces. I
don't think the movie is particularly scary, but with how tight the sets
are, I think it adds to the anxiety of the situation. There's very few
options when something comes down on your head.<br /><br />The biggest flaw I have with the movie is the music. It sucks. I like loud
music as much as the next person, but I think it is just too loud and
takes
away from the movie. It turns into a stupid MTV video. I think the music
could have added a lot to the creepiness of the film... very minimalistic
stuff... but as soon as any action happens, it turns into a stinking
SlipKnot album. I don't know what the best option would have been, but I
think the music could have been done better.<br /><br />Anyway, on the whole, a very good effort.
