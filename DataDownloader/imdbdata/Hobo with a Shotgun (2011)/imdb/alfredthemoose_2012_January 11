There&#x27;s some funny grindhouse humor to be found throughout the film,
but overall it&#x27;s disappointing. Most of the violence throughout the
film is without humor at all. Without a sharp script to back it up, the
whole thing feels pointless. Rutger Hauer turns in an amazing
performance, I couldn&#x27;t imagine anyone else, and he played it to near
perfection. He can be very funny and unpredictable, he is the best
thing about this movie.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t expect Machete like I did, because you will get very
disappointed. It&#x27;s definitely worth the watch, but Tarantino or
Rodriguez should have directed this instead.<br /><br />Moose finds this film worthy of an 8.
