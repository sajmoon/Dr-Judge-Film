Hobo with a Shotgun began its life, like that of Robert Rodriguez&#x27;
Machete (2010), as a faux trailer in amongst Don&#x27;t (Edgar Wright),
Thanksgiving (Eli Roth) and Werewolf Women of the SS (Rob Zombie). This
trailer, however was only shown in Canada, and some US territories.
With a very simple idea, Jason Eisner&#x27;s film expands the trailer much
more fluidly and with a more focused narrative than Machete. But where
as the latter dealt mainly with 1970&#x27;s exploitation tropes, this film
does the same for the 80&#x27;s of films such as James Glickenhaus&#x27;s The
Exterminator (1980 - a film I will be reviewing later as part of the
childhood memories project).<br /><br />Rutger Hauer&#x27;s Hobo walks into Hope Town (the sign at it&#x27;s border has
graffiti sprayed over the first word, replacing it with &#x22;SCUM&#x22;), to
find that the criminals run the place, death is a daily spectacle, and
law enforcement is as corrupt as the criminals. All the hobo wants to
do is collect enough money so he can buy a lawnmower and start a
business. After reaching his monetary target, and after witnessing some
horrific crime, he goes to the pawn shop &#x22;Pawn at Dawn&#x22;, only to be
disturbed by some armed robbers. Hauer picks up a shotgun (which is
priced the same as the lawnmower, $49.99), and begins his crusade to
clean the streets of criminals: &#x22;Delivering justice one shell at a
time&#x22;.<br /><br />The film has stylistic elements from a number of &#x27;80&#x27;s titles; whilst
there are some visually stunning, colourfully lit, sequences, there is
a cinematic juvenilism which is injected in some Troma-like scenes of
garish, almost-funny gore. The synth score echoes John Carpenter&#x27;s
arrangements for his early films. The criminals also have an almost
comic-book villainy to them: Their demands are frantically broadcast to
the entire city, as they hijack a television station; the performances
are exaggerated, and drenched in the 80&#x27;s need for bright, neon-like
colour. The criminal boss, Drake (Brian Downey), presents murders on
the streets like he is hosting a game show; a ringmaster to a
pugilistic, public spectacle.<br /><br />This is an over the top film that enjoys its exploits into violence and
excessive gore-splattering. Adolescent, Reagan-era morals (he is all of
those 80&#x27;s &#x22;tough guys&#x22;), and a whole lot of fun to watch. Hauer
clearly enjoys playing this character. He revels in the comic, bloody
excesses. As a bizarre note: The song in the closing credits is &#x22;Run
With Us&#x22; by Lisa Lougheed, which was also the theme tune to 1980&#x27;s
Saturday morning cartoon &#x27;The Raccoons&#x27;.<br /><br />www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com
