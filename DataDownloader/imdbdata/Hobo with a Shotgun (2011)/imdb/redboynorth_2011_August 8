I like Rutger Hauer but certainly didn&#x27;t like this movie... What is
this pile of C**P? It must&#x27;ve been produced by the trailer park boys
but with a smaller budget! Nice to see Brian Downey is back on his feet
and trying to act again. Keep trying Brian I&#x27;m sure something better
will come along. <br /><br />As for the plot, was there one? Acting was just below substandard and
the script was awful. I feel sick for all the gratuitous gore...
actually, I kinda liked it although much of it was inappropriate and
out of balance with the rest of the plot... ohhhh that&#x27;s right, no
plot.
