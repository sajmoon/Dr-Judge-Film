It&#x27;s depressing to see Rutger Hauer - an excellent actor with some fine
performances under his belt- resorting to appear in utter low budget
drivel like this. I guess he must be desperate to receive a paycheck to
slum it in this rubbish.<br /><br />Let&#x27;s be honest there is no plot, no worthwhile characters, no
redeeming performances,pathetic production values. There is a lot of
gore but its amateurishly done.<br /><br />I gave this movie a generous 2 out of 10..more than it deserves but I
wanted to differentiate it from Timo Rose&#x27;s Karl the butcher versus Axe
which I rated 1. Of course if the IMDb allowed me to give karl a score
of zero then I would have allocated it the nothing it deserves and hobo
would have been rated 1.<br /><br />This movie is not worthwhile. Don&#x27;t believe a film is professionally
made just because it has a once great actor in it.
