Pulp flicks can sometimes get a bit too ahead of themselves. Sometimes
all you need is a hobo, a shotgun and a twisted sense of justice.<br /><br />Rutger Hauer stars in &#x22;Hobo with a Shotgun,&#x22; the second film after
&#x22;Machete&#x22; to be derived from a fake trailer created for the Robert
Rodriguez/Quentin Tarantino double-feature &#x22;Grindhouse.&#x22; Although the
Hobo and that dangerous Mexican share revenge from the same cold plate,
Jason Eisener does decidedly more with decidedly less.<br /><br />Beneath the bulky jacket and hobo stench lies something somehow
untainted. When most exploitation flicks get down to the dramatic side
&#x97; if they ever get that far &#x97; usually flop. Most viewers would prefer
the Hobo waste no time getting to that shotgun, but Hauer hints at a
depth to that vigilante justice. No matter how hypocritical he might
actually be, he&#x27;s darn convincing and dare I say poignant.<br /><br />The film takes place in what was once called Hope Town but has since
become &#x22;F*** Town.&#x22; The streets are full of bums, druggies, prostitutes
and corruption of all kinds. The Hobo hops off the train to find the
town in this state and cannot sit idly by. After trying to intervene
with the mistreatment of a whore (Molly Dunsworth), the Hobo learns the
hard way that a mob boss named &#x22;The Drake&#x22; (Brian Downey) runs things
in this town with his two dopey and perverted sons.<br /><br />Credit to Eisener and co-writers John Davies and Rob Cotterill for
taking their time building the proper motivation, which feels odd to
say as screen writing almost never warrants praise in a film of this
kind. Yet when our Hobo must choose between purchasing a lawn mower to
start his landscaping business or pulling that shotgun off the shelf to
help &#x22;clean&#x22; the streets, the decision makes sense &#x97; kill or be killed.
The Hobo metes justice &#x22;one shell at a time&#x22; and to the delight of gore
fans everywhere.<br /><br />The blood flows here as sure as the one-liners do, which makes &#x22;Hobo&#x22; a
true child of the neo-grindhouse movement. Most admirably, the gore
goes unexpected places; our heroes, for example, see their fair share
of personal injury and beyond the extent to which most protagonists
must stare down fate. Plus, despite the mercilessly foul lines
delivered prior to most executions, there&#x27;s actually some strangely
thoughtful dialogue, such as the Hobo&#x27;s little monologue to the
newborns in the maternity ward of the local hospital. It&#x27;s funny, but
it&#x27;s also kind of got a point &#x97; even hobos were innocent little babies
once.<br /><br />&#x22;Hobo with a Shotgun&#x22; adds just enough bite to its bark, whereas most
of its brothers and sisters simply make noise. Somehow Eisener manages
to weave all the clich&#xE9; exploitation elements into something all too
easy to enjoy.<br /><br />~Steven C<br /><br />Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com
