Yes it was great! The Hobo was awesome! The words were incredible! I
was more than fascinated watching this!<br /><br />Endless, pointless violence, actually so much that it turns out funny!
Misantropy! It actually shows the future of the streets in a more
extreme form! <br /><br />I always loved those &#x22;punisher&#x22; type movies and this is one of the
best.<br /><br />It actually reaches &#x22;Grindhouse&#x22;. The director used very similar 70&#x27;s
style effects.<br /><br />The plot is awesome. Small, simple and awesome.<br /><br />Every scene was extreme, bloody and violent. <br /><br />I wish I could find more movies like that!
