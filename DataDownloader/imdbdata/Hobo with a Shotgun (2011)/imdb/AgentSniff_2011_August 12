I&#x27;ve looked foreword for this film for a long, long time. The fake
trailer was awesome, the real trailer was just as crazy and fun. This
seemed to be a great grindhouse flick a la Machete. Much to my
disappointment this was not good.<br /><br />It was not far from awful. It lacked all the self aware irony that made
Machete and Grindhouse so good. All the funny stuff from the trailer
was there, but in the film it was not funny. There were not a single
good performance in the flick. Not even Rutger Hauer, one of my idols
was any good in it.<br /><br />Hobo with a Shotgun had a brilliant concept that failed tragically. The
direction, the script... They did not create the awesome flick this was
meant to be. Usually I am very, very angry when I see bad films like
this, but this just made me sad. <br /><br />The character don&#x27;t work, they are not funny. They are not cool. They
are boring. How could a movie about a hobo with a shotgun be so boring? <br /><br />The characters of the Plague on the other hand was the only thing that
actually turned out good. They where in it too little but where very
interesting. But that can&#x27;t save the movie.<br /><br />I suggest you go watch Machete if you want the awesome exploitation
homage you might be looking for here, because Machete douse not
disappoint.
