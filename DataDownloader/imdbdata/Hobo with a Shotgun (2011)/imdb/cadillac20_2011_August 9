If you&#x27;re not one for the Grindhouse experience, you can move on.
Grindhouse films are definitely acquired taste, and Hobo pulls no
punches. If you don&#x27;t have the stomach for extreme and bloody violence
and gore, then this is not the film for you. Then again, with a film
called Hobo with a Shotgun, you should all ready know what you&#x27;re
getting into. For the rest of us, Hobo is a fantastically funny film
that delivers on the Grindhouse experience ins buckets of blood, a
nonsensical plot, and a presentation that is both retro and new age.<br /><br />Rutger Hauer delivers a fine performance as the titular hobo, who is
out to wreak bloody justice in a town that is complete chaos. And chaos
it definitely is. There is no mercy here. We have people disemboweled
with a razor bladed bat, we have a school bus full of kids being blow
torched, we have teens getting force fed a pile of cocaine, etc. And
that&#x27;s only for starters. Once the shotgun comes into play, all bets
are off. Those who are used to such films will take comfort in the
familiar splatter and violence, but others not so ready should be
warned. That said, this wasn&#x27;t nearly as graphic as I anticipated. I
suppose that&#x27;s a good thing, as it&#x27;s still pretty darned graphic, but I
was a tad surprised. <br /><br />For such a film, though, the talent is surprisingly good. Rutger
actually displays quite a bit of acting chops here, and it&#x27;s nice to
see that the actors take the film seriously. There&#x27;s definitely a fair
amount of tongue in cheek humor and play here, but the film is treated
in all seriousness. Even the cinematography and script are just above
appropriate. For this kind of film, a production of this level is a
pleasant surprise. Overall, it&#x27;s just a fun, well made time.
