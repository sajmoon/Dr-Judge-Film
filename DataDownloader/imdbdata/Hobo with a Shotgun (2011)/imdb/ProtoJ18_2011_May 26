Planet Terror and Deathproof arrived several years ago to great acclaim
from fans everywhere. Fans who didn&#x27;t even really know what a
&#x27;grindhouse&#x27; movie was supposed to be, wouldn&#x27;t recognize (or even
watch) one if it was given to them, and probably couldn&#x27;t tell Toxie
from Swamp Thing.<br /><br />It&#x27;s like a low budget movie right? With, like, violence and stuff.<br /><br />Not quite. Keep trying. Only those &#x27;exploitation&#x27; films estimated a
budget over 50 million dollars. Probably more than the budget of every
single &#x27;grindhouse&#x27; movie ever made. Combined. And not half as good.<br /><br />Oh, sure, the fans like it. Fans who probably thought it was
&#x27;original&#x27;, or &#x27;different&#x27;. But to anyone who actually knew what they
were watching, the films were barely tolerable. The exploitation here,
was the exploitation of the source material itself. Like a cheap street
hooker who costs as much as a hotel escort and doesn&#x27;t leave when she&#x27;s
done; pimped by two directors, who before tried to find new creative
voices, now spending their time trying to creatively rip other movies
off. You got the sense during those movies it was less a film than a
form of cinema masturbation for the creators. A one man show that
didn&#x27;t need to be good or creative, as long as it got off the ground
with their name on it. Movies about movies by guys remaking movies
they&#x27;d seen before and hoped you hadn&#x27;t.<br /><br />Oh, but they had &#x27;star power&#x27; and pretty CGI, and cameos, and and
and...... Everything a &#x27;grindhouse&#x27; movie should never have. The runty
little mistake Machete would follow, and impress yet more easily
impressed people.<br /><br />Hobo with A Shotgun asks for a change. Aka NONE of the things those
movies had. No &#x27;star power&#x27;. No &#x27;CGI&#x27;. No phoned in Hollywood cameos to
impress stupid people. No +$10 million budgets. And absolutely no
Jessica Alba. What we have here is as close an approximation of a
modern day exploitation movie as we&#x27;re gonna get. And the results
aren&#x27;t half bad.<br /><br />Oh, it has its weaknesses. The ending is pretty slipshod compared to
the rest of the film and bit of a letdown, and at times you&#x27;re
wondering if Hauer might bump into The Toxic Avenger while the director
strip-mined the Tromaville toolbox. But the attention to detail does a
lot to overcome those weaknesses. Little 80&#x27;s mise-en-scene (clothes,
cars), some surprisingly creative set pieces, hilariously abusive
lighting and color schemes, and a fantastic score both laughably
nostalgic and overtly pulse pounding. The precision of The Plague
&#x27;castle&#x27; and costumes might be worth the price of admission alone. The
tropes the film uses, subverts, and lampshade highlight everything
Tarantino and Rodriguez did wrong.<br /><br />A &#x27;good&#x27; exploitation movie made up for its off-Hollywood limitations
by bypassing movie/social norms and working creatively within a
shoestring budget. And in the end, you get the sense the director of
&#x27;Hobo&#x27; did everything possible to time travel to low budget fantasy
land, working with zero star &#x27;power&#x27; and a small budget. The results
are hardly original but nonetheless enjoyable. Those who&#x27;ve actually
seen real exploitation movies should be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />All of this is a stark contrast to some other directors, content to
slap their &#x27;star&#x27; status names on +$40 million budgets and laugh their
way to the bank. I&#x27;m not sure where they go to cash these checks, but
one thing is for sure, it&#x27;s a long long way from the grindhouse.
