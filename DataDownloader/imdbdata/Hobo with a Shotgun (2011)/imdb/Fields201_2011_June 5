A friend of mine really wanted to see this, and since I had it on
demand, he came over and watched it. What drew me in was Rutger Hauer,
who is an awesome actor, so I decided to watch it with him.<br /><br />This is not a film I would recommend to my mother.<br /><br />With that being said, there is violence everywhere. I think that&#x27;s the
drawing point to this film. It also has this 1970&#x27;s look to it, which
I&#x27;m sure is what they were going for, and it almost looks extremely low
budget like it was made locally or something. Not only that, but it
also looked like a film that a struggling filmmaker just for the
controversy to give him a break.<br /><br />The film opens with Rutger Hauer as a homeless man witnessing some big
crime family killing some guy on the street. They are harassing people
everywhere and the police are in on it as well. So the hobo decides to
take it upon himself to strike back, with shotgun in hand, and soon
there is a war between him and them. The bad guys take it one step
further and starts killing children. Violence is everywhere.<br /><br />The hobo befriends some girl in the movie who is portraying herself as
a teacher. Some of these moments where the develop a relationship with
each other is where it slows down the film. That&#x27;s also where my friend
fell asleep until I had to wake him up through the bloody parts. I also
liked the chances the film makes because not many films would depict
children being burned to death in a schoolbus until now.<br /><br />If you&#x27;re a fan of some mindless, bloody fun then Hobo With A Shotgun
is right up your alley. I appreciate the chances the film makes, but I
doubt I would ever watch it again. I&#x27;ll watch Machete again before I
watch Hobo With A Shotgun. It&#x27;s great to see Rutger Hauer again,
though.
