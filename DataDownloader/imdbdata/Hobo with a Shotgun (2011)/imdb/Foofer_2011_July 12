&#x22;Hobo with a Shotgun.&#x22; Excellent title. Bad movie. Really bad movie.
Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. And I watched &#x22;The Human
Centipede (First Sequence).&#x22; <br /><br />I can&#x27;t remember the last time I was so excited to see a film. &#x22;Hobo
With a Shotgun.&#x22; Wow. What a title! The only thing that could make a
title like that better is &#x22;Hobo With a Shotgun&#x22; starring Rutger Hauer.
What luscious music to my ears! What a tremendous letdown.<br /><br />The two leads and the family of baddies should have been interesting
but we don&#x27;t learn much about them. The movie contains some dull
exposition interspersed with let&#x27;s-see-how-shocking-we-can-be torture
porn. That&#x27;s it.<br /><br />I have been told by fans that the movie is supposed to be bad. In that,
it succeeded spectacularly. However, if you are looking for the fun,
kick-ass, so-bad-it&#x27;s-good that was &#x22;Machete&#x22; you will be sorely
disappointed.
