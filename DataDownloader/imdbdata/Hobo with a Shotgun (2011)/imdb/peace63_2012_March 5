I have been a fan of Rutger Hauer for many years. He gets dark humor.
He says his lines with a twinkle in his eyes, not just what he said,
but what he was thinking. That is what makes his performances so much
fun to watch. He is a cool cat, a lot like Steve McQueen (remember
Wanted: Dead or Alive?). <br /><br />This film is definitely a statement of sorts. It is balls to the wall
action, totally over the top and politically incorrect. It covers the
Krays demented London mafia family and makes fun of them and of America
and the extra-politically correct European values all at the same time. <br /><br />It is not art or a political movie. It is just good old, in-your-face,
up-your-axe rudeness, truth, brutality, sarcasm, and over-the-edge
laughter at the insanity of life. It is a movie about a world where
evil people run society. The police are their corrupt henchmen. The
working class mindlessly follows the social order. A hobo with a
shotgun is the only one, who is crazy enough, to try to make things
right. <br /><br />There is so much wrong about this movie, that it explodes on the canvas
like a Picasso; distorted, and yet a true reflection of life, and
society.
