Hobo With a Shotgun got it&#x27;s start the same way that Danny Trejo movie
Machete got it&#x27;s start -- a fake trailer on the movie Grindhouse. That
right there should tell you that it&#x27;s not exactly theater fare.. it&#x27;s
exploitation at it&#x27;s best, pure and simple. And with a title like Hobo
With a Shotgun, were you really expecting Academy Award winning acting
and/or story lines? I certainly hope not. The film is ultra violent,
totally offensive, rude, crude, disgusting, and has both gratuitous
nudity and language. Am I a bad person for wanting even more? <br /><br />The movie opens with some broke-ass credits which should either tell
you that you&#x27;re gonna love it or you&#x27;re gonna hate it. You have to come
into a picture like this with a sense of humor or your next 86 minutes
is going to be really uncomfortable. The hobo (Hauer in a do-or-die
depiction) rides the rails into Hope Town (aptly nicknamed either Scum
Town or F**K Town by the residents) and can clearly see that this town
is in dire need of some cleaning up. He tries to bring a punk named
Slick (Smith) to justice by making a citizen&#x27;s arrest, but that
backfires in a major way. It seems this town is run by a local scumbag
named Drake (Downey) and his two sons: Slick and Ivan (Bateman). The
hobo tries to panhandle up some dough, enough for him to buy a
lawnmower (don&#x27;t ask) and when he has enough loot to buy said dream
machine, a robbery occurs and he opts for a shotgun instead. Pre-loaded
for his convenience, I guess. Also, it apparently comes with a cheat
code for unlimited ammo. I&#x27;m not nitpicking, the movie is what it is.<br /><br />There might be some scenes in this movie that will totally offend you.
There might be some of the most despicable characters ever caught on
film in this movie. I wasn&#x27;t offended in the slightest -- even though
one particular scene did leave my jaw ajar as it was happening. I
wanted the film to go even further, I wanted it to just go wayyyyyy
over-the-top nuts. Just whatever you do, don&#x27;t come looking here for
story strength, character development and growth. It&#x27;s Hobo With a
Shotgun. It&#x27;s not The Shawshank Redemption, it&#x27;s not The Godfather,
it&#x27;s just a Hobo... with a shotgun. More reviews at www.soveryterry.com
Final Grade: B+
