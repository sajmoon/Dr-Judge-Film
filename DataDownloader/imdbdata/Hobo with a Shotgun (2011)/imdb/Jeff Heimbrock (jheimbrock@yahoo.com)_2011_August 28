What do you expect from a movie called Hobo With a Shotgun? While it&#x27;s
campy violence certainly makes for some huge laughs, it&#x27;s sadistic tone
tends to be too much for me. <br /><br />Rutger Hauer is devouring his role (though with perfect teeth, no
doubt). It&#x27;s literally hell on Earth, and the only person out there to
stop them is Superman the hobo with a shotgun. The film certainly gives
us plenty of motives for why this man is killing, and what would seem
deranged is then taken for a sort of heroism. That might be one of the
working points of the film, a sort of metaphor for class dynamic and
conflict, but that would be a much deeper reading into the film than it
ever probably intended.<br /><br />I appreciate the exploitation throwback to the classic slasher genres,
but that still doesn&#x27;t qualify it as a necessarily good film, not that
it ever tries to be more than a B, no more like Z, horror movie. It is
a film to be enjoyed on the basis of it&#x27;s own ridiculousness, much like
the hilarious Piranha 3D, but unlike Piranha, this one might leave an
unwanted uneasiness in your stomach. If your into that, this totally
works as a parody film (fans of this genre will revel in the
consistently inventive ways the filmmakers kill of characters), but for
me I couldn&#x27;t get past the incessant grotesque nature, right down to
the over-the-top horrific color palette. C-
