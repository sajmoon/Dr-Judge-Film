Saw this movie with my daughter for a grind house date night. We really
enjoyed Machete and were pretty hopeful going into this one. We&#x27;ve seen
a lot of schlocky movies, having a perchance for the &#x22;B&#x22; side but
nothing prepared us for the glory that was &#x22;Hobo With A Shotgun&#x22;. What
make this such a great flick is that it in not a spoof or even a
homage, it is the real deal. Everyone is playing it straight; even when
the mood is humorous, it isn&#x27;t with that annoying winking at the camera
that so many modern grind house movies engage in.<br /><br />Kind of a spaghetti western type plot with the nameless drifter blowing
into town and finding himself in the middle of a war. The Hobo soon
finds himself on the radar of the vicious gang lord Drake and his sons
when he stands up for the downtrodden towns folk and gets a brutal beat
down. The whore with a heart of gold nurses him back to health and then
it&#x27;s pay bake with a vengeance. Classic themes well executed and above
average acting and dialogue.
