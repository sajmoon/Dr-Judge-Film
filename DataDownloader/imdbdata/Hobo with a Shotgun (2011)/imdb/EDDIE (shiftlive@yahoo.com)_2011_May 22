Rutger Hauer is great as the Hobo with a shotgun, but there are two
movies at battle here. One is a gritty exploitation film about a man
pushed beyond his limit and a Troma movie complete with horribly over
the top performances, topless girls engaged in tired acts of
ultra-violence, and many freezer size bags of fake cocaine. Hobo With A
Shotgun is just too Troma, which is not a great surprise given that
just like Troma movies it is a copy of the real thing. It&#x27;s a shame
that Rutger Hauer was making one movie, which was pitch perfect, while
the others involved seemed to be making another far less interesting
one.
