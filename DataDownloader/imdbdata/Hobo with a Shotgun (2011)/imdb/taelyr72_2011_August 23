This movie was by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen,
starring the actor Rutger Hauer!!! Not to mention a DIRECTOR.....
filming CHILDREN GETTING BURNED ALIVE!!!!! @#%&#x26; YOU JASON EISNER!!!!!!!
You cannot think that just because you have a good cast, you can make
them act like they are in a Rob Zombie film... He is a genius when it
come to the macabre. YOU are not!!! keep S@*&#x26;ing That dead N!**#$ d!^$.
Maybe one day you will become a director that can put out a decent
movie.........................................................Sorry not
enough dots for you! This movie had some of the worst acting The worst
graphics Nothing was realistic But by far the worst thing I could see
was all of the kids being burned alive on the bus!!!!!
