...sort of.<br /><br />SMALL SPOILERS In Blighty we called the style of move these
&#x27;grindhouse&#x27; movies are harking back to video nasties. They were seldom
realised in the cinema and include classics of the like of Evil Dead
(2, to my mind).<br /><br />I would go further and add that in the states, the likes of Stalone and
Arnies early gung ho shooters are an off shoot of that genre and are
definitely being aped/mocked/revered (delete as you feel).<br /><br />First up, it does not shock me that threads like - &#x27;if you like this
movie, you are sick...&#x27; have started up.<br /><br />One, this is a very violent and gory film. The violence is not
slapstick and is of a very brutal nature.<br /><br />But, I refer you to my original comparison to Cobra style flicks.<br /><br />The film - if you watch it - has an essential message of standing up
against criminals and corruption. Is this something that makes a person
&#x27;sick&#x27;? I don&#x27;t think so. The level of force a person uses, of course,
is a matter of personal and moral choice...<br /><br />And creative choice, in this films case. The manner in which the
denizens of *uck Town meet their death at Drake&#x27;s hands is as
fascinating as well as shocking.<br /><br />The two anti heroes - Abby and Hobo - are passionately played.
Conventions are turned on their heads as the film progresses right up
to the last reel.<br /><br />It is a film that is full of metal-bondage-death metal style imagery,
and if you filter out the extraordinary level of violence, the visual
impact of this film is immense. It blurs a metal fantasy with a 80&#x27;s
Death Wish style image of the world.<br /><br />You need to see the visualisation around the Plague when they turn up
to see fully what I mean....<br /><br />Performances are mesmerising from Hauer and Downey down to the craziest
hospital staff you&#x27;ll ever meet. Did I mention the Plague? See it to
believe it.<br /><br />There is more to this film than the violence which is will be reviled
for. I can&#x27;t help thinking that most of the hate this film will receive
will be because the dealers of most of the retribution are a homeless
man and a hooker.<br /><br />If they were a muscled police officer and blonde with a boob job, I
think a lot of this film&#x27;s critics wouldn&#x27;t bat an eyelid - which is
possibly a point which the filmmakers are trying to make.
