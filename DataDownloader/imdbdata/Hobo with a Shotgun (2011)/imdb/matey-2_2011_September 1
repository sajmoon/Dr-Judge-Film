If everyone is being honest then this film was never going to win any
Oscars, or other awards of that ilk. However, this borderline fable
depicting film does provide just over an hour&#x27;s worth of entertainment,
subjecting the viewer to some fairly graphic violence. When I say
&#x22;fairly&#x22;, I mean if you cannot stand decapitations or disembowelments (
no matter how fake!), this movie is probably not for you! Anyone who
appreciates the animation used in The Thing and other movies of that
generation may appreciate some of the &#x22;retro&#x22; (or low-budget to some
people) effects used here.<br /><br />Like several other reviewers on here I was not sure whether to
laugh/cry/cringe/combination of all three throughout the duration of
the movie. In actual fact I did a combination of all three.
Unfortunately, most of the cringing was down to some of the terrible
script/plot, not due to overdose on gore. The plot could have been
developed a little better, without the use of extended (relatively!)
and some excessively clich&#xE9;d monologues. Probably not something to
watch with the better half, but definitely worth a shot with the lads
and a couple of beers. Rutger Hauer plays his part, along with a couple
of other half decent attempts at acting dotted throughout the cast. As
the viewer you do feel sympathy towards Hauer&#x27;s situation and the
subsequent actions he takes. The &#x22;bad&#x22; characters are amply
annoying/vulgar enough to warrant their pre-determined fates.<br /><br />Overall, this movie could have had a little more substance and a few
roles could have been cast/performed a lot better. If you like watching
a movie which gives your stomach a few knots to contend with, without
any significant cerebral involvement, then this film ticks several
boxes.
