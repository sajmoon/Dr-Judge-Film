For me, that movie came from nowhere, and it seems as years go by, it&#x27;s
the best way to watch great movies.<br /><br />A great movie, indeed. I understand there&#x27;s been some mixed reviews on
this one, and i won&#x27;t disgress on that, but let me just point out, that
there&#x27;s all king of genres out there, new things coming out, that may
not agree everyone taste. Let me just say, that to me not liking a
movie, doesn&#x27;t make it a &#x22;bad&#x22; movie. Apart from my tastes, there are a
lot of things to consider: plot, acting, directing, ideas, that can
make a movie stand its ground, however the mixed review it gets.<br /><br />That being said, Hobo, just rocks on all aspects. For any one that like
grindhouse, gory, or satiric movies, you might just find you&#x27;re catch
with this one. <br /><br />Everything is very well done, and i&#x27;m amazed at how the movie gets so
ingenious at keeping it&#x27;s mood and strengh throughout all it&#x27;s length.<br /><br />Thumbs up to Rughter Hauer. This man has been a long time favorite of
mine, but here it is, his best acting performance, as those kinds of
roles i find the most demanding from their actors.<br /><br />So give it a good try, relax, and prepare to be taken on a special
journey, as great flicks manage to do, this one is for history
