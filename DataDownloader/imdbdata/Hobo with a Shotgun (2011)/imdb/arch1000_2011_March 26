This is a film that is intentionally made to &#x22;look&#x22; like a bad 80s
grindhouse/exploitation film. And guess what? It succeeds. It is a
terrible sex, drugs, prostitution, and violence exploitation film. The
movie doesn&#x27;t impart a clear point. There is no plot, or really any
kind of depth to the events taking place in this movie&#x27;s
pseudo-fictional world. It is graphically poor. technically simplistic.
Dialog is scarce and just as bad as in any movie of this genre. There
is no clear reason for why most of the stylistic elements in this movie
are chosen.<br /><br />I say, i&#x27;ts always easier to make an intentionally poor film, rather
than an intentionally good one.<br /><br />The only thing that this film is very successful at is being an
archetypal Canadian feature. Unfortunately, in the negative sense of
this statement. And I am typically very found of Canadian cinema.
