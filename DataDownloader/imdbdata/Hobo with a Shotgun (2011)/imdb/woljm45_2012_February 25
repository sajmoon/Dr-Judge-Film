I&#x27;ve been wanting to buy the DVD of this movie for quite some time, but
just never made the leap when I saw it on the shelves. Last night it
happened to air on Showtime, so I gave it a shot, and I was instantly
blown away!!! I guess it could be labeled as a dark comedy, but there&#x27;s
also so much brutal reality tied into it that the only way to tell a
tale such as this is through humor. Rutger Hauer plays a hobo who
passes through a town which is under the thumb of a sadistic mob boss
and his bratty sons who happen to control everything, even the police
force. After witnessing too much crime and debauchery around him, the
hobo decides enough is enough and takes up a shotgun to start cleaning
the city streets.<br /><br />The plot isn&#x27;t the most sophisticated in the world, but the comic book
fashion in which the story is told makes it every enjoyable to watch. I
like when a movie knows what type of movie it is and doesn&#x27;t take
itself too seriously. This reminded me of a crossover between &#x22;The
Toxic Avenger&#x22; and &#x22;Sin City&#x22;.<br /><br />It&#x27;s also a very short flick, so there&#x27;s no reason not to spend 90
minutes to see this wacky gem.
