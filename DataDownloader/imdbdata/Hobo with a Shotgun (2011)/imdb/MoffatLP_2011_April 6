I watched the trailer to this movie and thought, WOW! This has to be an
absolute gore feast, and yes, it was. This movie was awesome. It was
fun, funny, and above all, gory. You are sure to have fun with this
movie, if you want to have a good time with a movie, check it out. It
is sure to be a lovable movie for all ages (and by that I mean
mature-male audiences). I watched the unrated trailer and it pretty
much sums up the movie. The plot is pretty much explained in the title,
A Hobo With A Shotgun. I really enjoyed listening to the soundtrack to
this movie, it fit the time of emotion, from feeling sad, crazy action,
lots of gore or even watching the hobo on a train in the opening
credits. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the plot played out
well throughout the movie.<br /><br />To like this movie, you can&#x27;t be offended by extreme violence, and lots
of gore. May I also warn you that there are some disturbing scenes in
this. It was a funny movie and plot-wise it was pretty odd. It wasn&#x27;t
all I expected, wondering how they could make a movie about a hobo
running around clearing the streets of crime with his shotgun, to think
about this you don&#x27;t really think that much dialogue could be achieved,
but they succeeded pretty well. It was very entertaining and good as an
all-around movie. If you like action, thrillers, or just want to have a
good time, see this movie and you will certainly get what you paid for.
It shows a good feeling of hatred toward the bad guys, who you really
hate. In some movies they try to make you feel like you don&#x27;t like
them, but this one did a good job at that. All-in-all it was good in
it&#x27;s own strange way unexplainable by words. Watch it, if you can get
by the excessive violence, like having a good time or like action, go
to the movies, or you can even wait for it&#x27;s release on DVD, it will be
a great movie either way.
