Rutger Hauer is quite rightly revered for his excellent performance as
replicant Roy Batty in Ridley Scott&#x27;s Bladerunner, but the film that
really made me a fan was Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s Flesh + Blood, a medieval
masterpiece so loaded with wanton sex and violence that it made Russell
Harty, Barry Norman&#x27;s occasional stand-in on BBC&#x27;s Film &#x27;85, leave the
cinema in disgust (an act which, in turn, made me go to the cinema in
order to be disgusted).<br /><br />Now, after years of being unjustly relegated to straight-to-video hell,
Rutger makes a welcome return to gratuitously excessive exploitation
style cinema in the unapologetically trashy Hobo With A Shotgun, a
project that started life as a fake trailer created to help promote
Tarantino/Rodriguez&#x27;s disappointing love-letter to cult cinema
Grindhouse, but which, as a fully fledged feature, actually shows the
big boys of throwback movie-making just how this sort of thing should
really be done.<br /><br />With its convincing retro opening credits (the font used for Hobo&#x27;s
title looking more than a little like that used for They Call Her One
Eye), a deliberately corny script, gloriously over-saturated
Technicolour cinematography, and a total lack of restraint where taste
and decency is concerned, Hobo successfully evokes the spirit of the
70s and 80s, when films were fun and the phrase &#x27;politically correct&#x27;
never even existed.<br /><br />Director Jason Eisener&#x27;s rough and ready, anything goes approach
ensures a suitably wild ride for those who like their entertainment
sick and sleazy, offering plenty of moments guaranteed to get the more
sensitive of souls in a lather: I can&#x27;t remember the last time I saw
something as malicious as a bus full of schoolchildren being torched
with a flame-thrower, as sadistic as a man being beaten with a razor
blade covered baseball bat, as cringe-worthy as a hand being minced in
the blade of a lawnmower, and as twisted as a paedophile dressed as
Santa pulling his pud outside a school gate&#x97;all in the one film!!!
Hell, I&#x27;m enjoying myself reading the reviews written by the morally
outraged almost as much as I did watching the film.<br /><br />8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for the awesome, murderous, armour-clad
duo known as The Plague!
