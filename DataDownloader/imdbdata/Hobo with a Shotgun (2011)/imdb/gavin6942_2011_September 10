A homeless vigilante (Rutger Hauer) blows away crooked cops, a
pedophile Santa (Brian Jamieson), and other scumbags with his trusty
pump-action shotgun.<br /><br />The trailer for this film circulated years before the real film ever
started production. And wow, did they translate it well. Every good
line of the trailer, every scenario, repeated and expanded for maximum
effect. And you add in some real talent like Rutger Hauer? That is just
a pure win.<br /><br />I know not everyone will love this film -- I mean, it sure is lacking
in plot and does not make complete logical sense. But if you like
mindless blood and guts, this should satisfy you!
