Hobo with a Shotgun is a great comeback for the charismatic actor
Rutger Hauer that has played in many well known classics of modern
cinema such as Blade Runner, Ladyhawke and The Hitcher. He plays the
role of a merciless and yet very philosophic, melancholic and warm
heartened homeless that gets in conflict with a whole corrupted city
where violence and crime reign when he tries to save the life of a
prostitute.<br /><br />This low budget b-movie has the potential to become a true cult movie.
It has some philosophical and introspective parts and presents an
exaggerated criticism of modern society. The acting is quite strong and
credible even though the movie works a lot with extremes and
stereotypical or exaggerated events which give the whole flick an
almost &#x22;dystopian&#x22; or at least abstract and surreal touch.<br /><br />But the main focus of the movie lies on the vengeance story that leads
to many harsh dialogues with memorable bad language quotes and a lot of
bloody execution scenes. There is a lot of blood and gore in this movie
and this is nothing for weak stomaches. Thanks to a lot of dark humour
and a lot of exaggerating moments, the whole thing doesn&#x27;t get too
heavy to disturb most of the viewers but the main characters are
credible and profound enough to connect the viewers to them. The movie
finds just the right middle way here and is easy to digest without
being too superficial and simplistic. Of course, the story is short,
sweet and simple and we should not expect any twists, surprises or
innovating moments but the potential cult factor is so elevated that we
don&#x27;t need those things to make this flick stay in our minds. The movie
generally feels like an experimental hack and slash movie with a
contemporary Asian style that can also be found in the latest works of
Quentin Tarantino for example.<br /><br />If you like rude and bloody vengeance movies with some memorable scenes
and quote, this movie here is your highlight of the year. If you are a
fan of Rutger Hauer, you will witness his strongest performance in
years and a great unexpected comeback. If you look for an entertaining
short and sweet b-movie that is not too flat to be one movie amongst
many others but not too commercial to lose its rude charm, you can&#x27;t go
wrong with this at all.<br /><br />You should only avoid this if you expect a well thought and twisted
vengeance story. You may find better stuff in the contemporary Asian
cinema with movies such as &#x22;Oldboy&#x22;, &#x22;Mother&#x22; or &#x22;I saw the devil&#x22;.
