Hobo With a Shotgun is a vile, disgusting, exploitation masterpiece
which only brings to light more violent entertainment for it&#x27;s
dedicated fans. If this film was marketed as a regular horror/action
film it would not only be false advertising and misunderstood, but put
in the wrong category all together. This is the second best thing to
come out of the modern day Grindhouse vault since Death Proof. It&#x27;s
everything it should be.<br /><br />Out of all the Grindhouse type films in the 2000&#x27;s like Planet Terror,
Death Proof, Machete, and Drive Angry 3D, Hobo With a Shotgun stands
out because of it&#x27;s title. It&#x27;s to the point. Picture the title and you
got the movie. The makers didn&#x27;t call it something more complex like
Citizen&#x27;s Arrest, Vigilante Justice, or Heartless and Homeless. They
called it Hobo With a Shotgun. It almost sounds some superhero an
action junkie second grader would come up with; &#x22;here comes the hobo
with a shotgun!&#x22; This is another film that was born from the 2007
double feature Grindhouse. It was one of the few fake trailers that ran
during the break between Planet Terror and Death Proof. This is the
second fake trailer from the 2007 film that got made into a feature
film, with the first being Machete. Both are great tributes to their
respected genre, but Hobo delivers more fun. The rules that apply to
regular films like acting and a well developed plot do not apply here.
The more blood, gore, and violence the better. You deduct points if
there isn&#x27;t enough. Grindhouse films are allowed to break almost every
film law. And then some.<br /><br />The plot, if you haven&#x27;t figured it out, is about a homeless man
(Hauer) who stumbles upon a lawless town with perverted townspeople,
scumbags galore, careless cops, and prostitution. After seeing the
damage done when he nearly survives a pawn shop robbery, the hobo takes
justice into his own hands and gets himself a shotgun. Now he&#x27;s a hobo
with a shotgun.<br /><br />That&#x27;s the jist. Why say more? I&#x27;m not going to ruin the suspense. You
should see this whether you know the mere definition of a Grindhouse
film. It&#x27;s that good. Yes there are scenes like the school bus clip and
others that threaten the very limits of decency and disorderly conduct
but THAT&#x27;S the point. Grindhouse is made for that. If this was a
mainstream release film with no forewarning of it being a homage to
films from the seventies than one star it would receive for not giving
consumers info on what they&#x27;re seeing.<br /><br />I knew going into this it would be very disgusting, disturbing, and
somewhat graphic. Never did I even touch the remote to pause it. I was
fully immersed.<br /><br />The film is available for a short amount of time on the Zune
Marketplace, iTunes, and On Demand. I assume the company who made this
film, in this case Rhombus Media, wants to get this seen by various
because it will not have a wide release. This is the same way I was
fortunate enough to see World&#x27;s Greatest Dad by using the Zune
Marketplace on Xbox Live. It&#x27;s a great thing. Especially when used to
promote films like this.<br /><br />Starring: Rutger Hauer, Brian Downey, and Gregory Smith. Directed by:
Jason Eisener.
