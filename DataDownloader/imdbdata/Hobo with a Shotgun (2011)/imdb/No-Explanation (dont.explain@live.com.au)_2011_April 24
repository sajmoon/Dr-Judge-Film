Review Five: Hobo With a Shotgun<br /><br />With a villain reminiscent of Jack Nicholson&#x27;s &#x27;The Joker&#x27; from Batman
(Burton, 1989) with the gore from the Saw franchise, you could be
nearly forgiven for considering Hobo with a Shotgun by Jason Eisener
(HWAS) a predecessor for the both, as it looks older than both. HWAS is
a part of the GRIND-HOUSE franchise, a series of films which have the
aesthetic and qualities of films from Grind-house theater heavily
popularized in the 70&#x27;s, that being films with a heavy focus on
exploitation. HWAS easily achieves the goal of being a part of this
cinema, being not only a parody of it (by emphasis and exaggeration)
but almost a perfect piece of it.<br /><br />When a Homeless Man (played by Rutger Hauer) travels to a new city by
train in hope of a new life, he arrives in a town full of crime run by
Drake (Brian Downey) and his family. Upon seeing the reckless disregard
for life and constant destruction of everything, he decides to bring
justice to the town, but when even the law enforcement is corrupt, this
isn&#x27;t an easy job.<br /><br />This film is hard to analyze, as it isn&#x27;t possible to judge it as a
standard &#x27;2011&#x27; film. The film takes glee in being back in the 70&#x27;s,
and it could easily be thought to be a very well up-scaled film
re-release. Quality-wise, this film looks amazing. Every line, hair and
even flaw is distinguished with ease. All the excessive gore looks as
fantastic as gore can. When coming to this type film, it&#x27;s to be
expected.<br /><br />The acting is brilliant. It&#x27;s campy, it&#x27;s bad, but it&#x27;s perfect. It&#x27;s
almost as if they were told to mix talented acting with awful acting,
and it works perfectly. Hobo is a pleasure to watch, and you may even
find some touching moments brought by him, but nobody is more fun than
Drake. His menacing act is as believable as it is unbelievable. You&#x27;ll
hear every moment, too. Every shot, every splatter, every of the part
of the spectacular soundtrack will amaze you with its quality. The
dialog is clear for every single line. Every unrelenting joke, from the
standard all the way to taboo (such as Rape jokes) will be heard.<br /><br />Gratuitous sex and violence is basically the calling card of this film,
and it&#x27;s often humorous. This film is unrelenting, and unbelievable.
Scenes such as the bus will maybe provoke a laugh, but is sick and
twisted enough that you&#x27;ll feel disgusted by the thought of it for long
afterward. It&#x27;s actually not bad though, and you&#x27;ll be wishing to watch
this film again as soon after as you can. The constant bad lines during
these moments would be cringe worthy in any other type of film, but
suitable enough here that one will love every single moment of it.<br /><br />RATINGS: For a popcorn flick - If you can handle excessive gore and
extreme themes, somewhat disturbing at times -&#x3E; 8/10, this film is an
absolute blast. If you can&#x27;t handle what is said above, if you&#x27;re
looking for a plot -&#x3E; 0/10, don&#x27;t even try. If this is your first
experience with Grind-house -&#x3E; 6/10, it may not make complete sense,
but it&#x27;ll surely satisfy! HWAS is an amazingly quality film due to it&#x27;s
lack of proper quality, it achieves everything it should. The only
gripe is the ending, which may or may not leave one satisfied. This
film is ultimately recommended, and left a want for a repeat viewing in
the near future. SOLID RATING: 8/10. For what it is, it does it well.
It won&#x27;t convert haters of the style to lovers, but it&#x27;s not meant to.<br /><br />This is grind-house fun at its best. Most comparable with Planet Terror
(Rodriquez, 2005), this brings more blood and action to the table,
though sacrifices substance of story and character building.
