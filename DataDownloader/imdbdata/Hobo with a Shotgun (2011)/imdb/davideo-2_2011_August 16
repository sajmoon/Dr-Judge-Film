STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning
** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Rutger Hauer plays a homeless man (let&#x27;s be politically correct about
it!) who wonders into a cartoonishly lawless town which a local villain
called Drake (Brian Downey) has in his grip, tying sewer lids around
the necks of those who cross him and knocking them into the ground so
their heads can be ripped off! The homeless man decides to take a stand
and takes to wiping all the filth off the streets with a shotgun, while
trying to help a sympathetic hooker named Abby (Molly Dunsworth) get
off the game.<br /><br />Always such pleasant affairs these Grindhouse entries, Jason Eisener&#x27;s
film revels in trash, exploitation and blood splattered violence like
no other. Somehow, though, it doesn&#x27;t manage to come off as any fun at
all. It&#x27;s all just such a hard, full on assault on the senses that it
has no effect at all, one of the worst of the &#x27;Grindhouse&#x27; entries.
Though his career descended into DTV hell after The Hitcher, Hauer has
always had a decent charm and presence in these kinds of movies, and
it&#x27;s nice to see him return in quite a &#x27;big&#x27; film, but there isn&#x27;t the
material here to raise him to the heights he could go, and maybe he
knows it. Although it does seem as if the role&#x27;s been catered to him a
bit, as it feels, especially towards the end, to be in the style of an
80s film, which were his forte, but it&#x27;s no less of an unrewarding
experience.<br /><br />It will probably get an appreciation among the hardcore of those who
love this sort of thing, but I found this hobo with a shotgun to
misfire quite badly. *
