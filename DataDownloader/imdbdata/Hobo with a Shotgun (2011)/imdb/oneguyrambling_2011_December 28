It&#x27;s one thing to deliberately make a movie reminiscent of the 70s and
80s low budget exploitation B flicks, direct to either drive in or VHS
depending on era. But making the same film sub-B grade cannot be
written off as clever or retro.<br /><br />Mr Hauer is the titular homeless man, weathered, beaten and bereft of
hope, he begs on street corners hoping to amass enough savings to
purchase himself a lawnmower. But this hobo lives in a lawless land
where the value of humanity is apparently negligible, and the police
presence at a similar level.<br /><br />A lawless land where a scantily clad chick might dance in the arterial
spray over a newly decapitated torso.<br /><br />Yeah. That sort of lawlessness.<br /><br />A morally bankrupt land where a nurse might stand over a patient and
scream &#x22;Live you f*cking whore!&#x22; Yeah. That sort of moral bankruptcy.<br /><br />Drake is the name to fear in this lawless, morally bankrupt, unnamed
land. It is he that runs all crime in the city, with two sons as his
apprentices to whom he attempts to impart his knowledge &#x96; read: make
them more nasty and reprehensible.<br /><br />Hobo (he is never named), makes the mistake of defending the virtue and
honour of a young woman with seemingly little virtue or honour to begin
with, and this brings the attention of the apprentices, most notably
Slick.<br /><br />Hobo initially attempts to lay low, but as things tend to do in these
films where revenge and retribution are prevailing themes he ultimately
snaps and sets about putting things right.<br /><br />This involves killing a lot of people, and if the title doesn&#x27;t hint as
to how then I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t help you much.<br /><br />Hobo&#x27;s vigilante justice brings much attention from the public and the
media, surprisingly not from the police who are never sighted in the
film, this enrages Drake who feels that his status as the most feared
guy in the area is suddenly being questioned. He puts a bounty on the
head of all homeless, especially Hobo.<br /><br />The last third of the film is a triumph of garishly bad lighting and
equally shonky acting.<br /><br />There is such little originality to be found in Hobo that I sat back
and pondered exactly what the filmmakers expected the audience to like.
The action was pretty average, the *comedy* was practically
non-existent even, and the deliberate bad acting and sheer hamminess
not noteworthy enough to demand a recommendation. Geez, if that is what
you want from a film John Carpenter made a dozen films through the 70s
and 80s with similar sensibilities that absolutely crush this film &#x96;
and a few worse ones too&#x85; <br /><br />The only thing I kept coming back to was the gore, and there I will
concede that the gore in Hobo with a Shotgun certainly was &#x27;extreme&#x27;
enough to get attention. But ultimately in an 80 minute movie with
precious little else going for it I will leave it up to you to decide
if that is enough to warrant a rental.<br /><br />Final Rating &#x96; 4 / 10. An unfortunate end to Rutgerfest, some gore,
some mean spirited and violence and profanity wrapped in a deliberately
sh*tty looking production. And apparently they are the reasons to watch
this!
