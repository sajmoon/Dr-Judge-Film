2012_January 26 
From the very beginning with its 70s intro with cheesy music in
Technicolor (they are not kidding you!), you know that these people are
just trying to have a laugh. There is not artistic value here
whatsoever, only tons of blood, bad catch phrases and absurdity. I
won&#x27;t go into that because its obvious. This movie won&#x27;t make a classic
(even though I suspect some people will want to make it a cult
classic). However, it&#x27;s entertaining enough. It&#x27;s not a bad film (for a
purposely bad film). It&#x27;s not a good film. It&#x27;s only like whistling:
you don&#x27;t get any from it but it&#x27;s enjoyable; some people hate, others
don&#x27;t. Let&#x27;s that seemingly absurd example get you a taste of the
nonsense of this film. An OK waste of time. <br /><br />And, no. Bears don&#x27;t become &#x22;man killers&#x22; when they taste human blood.
So leave them alone (Hobo, you were right though about not belonging to
a zoo)
