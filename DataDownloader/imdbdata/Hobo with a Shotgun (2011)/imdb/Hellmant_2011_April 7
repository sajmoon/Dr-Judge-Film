&#x27;HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN&#x27;: Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br /><br />The second &#x27;GRINDHOUSE&#x27; fake trailer to be adapted into a feature
length film (after last year&#x27;s &#x27;MACHETE&#x27;). This one won a contest to
promote &#x27;GRINDHOUSE&#x27; but was only featured with the film in some areas.
Unlike &#x27;MACHETE&#x27; non of the actual footage from the original ultra
low-budget trailer was used in the feature movie, although scenes and
lines from it were imitated. The actor who starred in the trailer,
David Brunt, plays a cop in the film and his part has been recast in
the movie by Rutger Hauer. The film tells the story of a homeless
vigilante who tries to clean up a crime ridden corrupt town after
moving there looking to start up a lawnmower business. It&#x27;s a perfect
homage to violent 80&#x27;s exploitation action films. The writing team that
created the fake trailer (newcomers Jason Eisener, John Davies and Rob
Cotterill) wrote the film as well and Eisener also directed. The film
premiers in theaters in limited release on May 6th but is available for
rent now on Amazon Video On Demand.<br /><br />The movie opens with optimism as a hobo (Hauer) moves into a new town
looking to start a new life and a new business. He finds a crime ridden
city ruled by a madman named Drake (Brian Downey) and his two sons
Slick (Gregory Smith) and Ivan (Nick Bateman). He witnesses the public
execution of Drake&#x27;s brother (played by Robb Wells, Ricky of &#x27;TRAILER
PARK BOYS&#x27; fame) and goes to the police but finds they&#x27;re all paid off
by Drake. One day when witnessing a robbery while trying to buy a
lawnmower at a pawn shop he uses his money to buy a shotgun instead,
after first using it to stop the robbers. He then goes on a one man
killing spree trying to rid the town of it&#x27;s filth and starts a war
with Drake. He finds assistance from a young hooker named Abby (Molly
Dunsworth) who he saved from being raped multiple times.<br /><br />The movie is gleefully violent and quite disturbing at times. It&#x27;s done
in such a cartoonish way though that it&#x27;s not too hard to watch and
it&#x27;s actually pretty entertaining, if you can stomach these types of
movies. Like &#x27;MACHETE&#x27; and the other &#x27;GRINDHOUSE&#x27; films it&#x27;s a perfect
throwback to the exploitation films of decades ago and is packed with
luscious nostalgia. Hauer is great in the lead and the directing is
perfectly fitting. The music also adds the perfect touch to the overall
80&#x27;s feel. It has a look and feel much like those of John Carpenter&#x27;s
greatest films, which all came from that beloved cinematic decade. If
you&#x27;re a fan of the genre you definitely won&#x27;t want to miss this &#x27;B&#x27;
movie film lover&#x27;s dream.<br /><br />Watch our review show &#x27;MOVIE TALK&#x27; at:
