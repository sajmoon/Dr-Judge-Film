Yes, they&#x27;re all killing it! It&#x27;s murder, it&#x27;s bloody, it is the
underdog getting a good beating and getting back. You know you want to
see this. This is not like any other movie you&#x27;ve seen. Perhaps you&#x27;ve
seen these road house movies, you&#x27;ve seen Running man, From Dusk till
Dawn, even Mad Max. Now this is not the perfect movie, nor the perfect
love making, but it is as close as one can get to the perfect
slaughter, the perfect sign to a failing humanity. So full of love and
hate. Like a poem in blood, like a painful reminder of then things that
matter. A sword that cuts through steel. Wanted dead or Alive, Rutger
Hauer, like it was yesterday evolved into tomorrow. See it. Cry. Feel
humanity burn your veins.
