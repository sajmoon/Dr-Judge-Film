This is a truly disgusting film. It contains some of the most brutal
violence I have ever seen. The villains are merciless and very cruel.
The main protagonist seems to be the only sane character in the film
and even he&#x27;s a little screwy. Do not expect any Oscar bait
performances because this is truly a B movie. Still, the film really
makes you laugh sometimes with all the absurd dialogue and the
senseless violence.If you are a fan of Trailer Park Boys than you may
just want to see this film on the sole purpose of Rob Wells ( Ricky )
that&#x27;s fine because he has a great bit part in here. If you are as
twisted as you would have to be to attend this picture then you will
not be disappointed. Be forewarned this film is not for the squeamish.<br /><br />8/10
