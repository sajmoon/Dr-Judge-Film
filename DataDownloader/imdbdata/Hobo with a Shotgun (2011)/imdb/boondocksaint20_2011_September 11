This is the movie that Planet Terror and Death Proof should have been.
It is a dark, fun, over the top violent, sleazy film that provides a
roller coaster ride for the viewer. Unlike the aforementioned two
films, this one really feels like you are watching this in a trashy
Grindhouse cinema.<br /><br />Rutger Hauer was simply awesome as the nameless hobo who has had enough
of the scum destroying his town. There are plenty of over the top gore
moments including heads blown off at close range, amputations,
stabbings, electrocutions and much more. It is all shot in good fun
(think Dead Alive or the Evil Dead).<br /><br />Everything about this movie was a throwback to the 1970&#x27;s/1980&#x27;s
schlock films that were all about uncensored shoestring budget thrills,
bare-bones plot, real life inaccuracies, grandiose speeches about life
from two-bit characters, etc. Even the ending, which I will not give
away, felt exactly like a typical Grindhouse film.<br /><br />Excellent B-Movie homage with great characters and special effects.
Just when you think it can&#x27;t top itself, it does again in the next
scene.
