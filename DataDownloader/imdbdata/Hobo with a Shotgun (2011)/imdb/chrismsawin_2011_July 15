With a name like Hobo with a Shotgun, you get exactly what&#x27;s
advertised; a hobo roaming an infested city with a shotgun attempting
to clean its streets of the filth that inhabits it. The story is
obviously simple and if the movie has intrigued you in any way, then
you probably weren&#x27;t attracted to it for the story alone. Rutger Hauer
is more than likely a drawing factor. The guy has talent and just seems
to have trouble picking the right project to be a part of. Hobo with a
Shotgun could definitely be considered over the top, but its
ridiculously memorable one liners, low budget exploitation atmosphere,
and nonstop use of practical effects for gore make you realize that
even though Rutger Hauer is getting up there in years he is still
capable of picking entertaining projects to be a part of every now and
then.<br /><br />There aren&#x27;t too many one-liners that can be shared due to them being
insanely vulgar as you can imagine, but there are a few that can be
squeezed in here. &#x22;I&#x27;m going to wash this blood off with your blood!&#x22;
One of the greatest aspects of the movie is that everything has this
tongue in cheek kind of feel to it, so there&#x27;s a sense of it not being
taken completely seriously even though the actions on screen are
fantastically gruesome and the entire cast seems to do their best to
give a riveting performance. &#x22;I&#x27;m gonna sleep in your bloody carcasses
tonight!&#x22; Rutger Hauer is the heart and soul of the movie. Without him
the movie would&#x27;ve just been completely senseless. Hauer at least tries
(and succeeds the majority of the time) of making you feel sympathy for
this hobo who just wants to start a business for himself and do what he
thinks is best for the city he&#x27;s currently in. &#x22;You and me are going&#x27;
on a car ride to hell... and you&#x27;re riding shotgun!&#x22; Blood plays a
serious role in Jason Eisener&#x27;s first directorial effort. Limbs get
chopped to bits, heads get blown off and chopped off by barbed wire
nooses tied to truck bumpers, razorblade bats slice open stomachs to
unleash their caged intestines, even children aren&#x27;t safe. It&#x27;s a
bloodsoaked ride from its fairly calm beginning to hellacious, shell
heavy ending.<br /><br />There&#x27;s a monologue Rutger Hauer makes outside the baby ward of a
hospital that could easily be labeled as the key scene you can&#x27;t miss
in the movie. This is the best Hauer has been in years and most of his
dialogue is the best it&#x27;s been since Blade Runner. The lighting used in
the movie is also really amazing. It&#x27;s very drastic and usually yellow,
red, purple, or blue. It gives the movie a retro feel, which fits
perfectly with its exploitation homage. There&#x27;s also this music that&#x27;s
used when The Plague first shows up that helps establish that
atmosphere, as well. It sounds like it&#x27;s very John Carpenter influenced
and makes movies like this feel all the more genuine.<br /><br />Hobo with a Shotgun obviously isn&#x27;t going to be for everybody. It won&#x27;t
win any Oscars and you probably won&#x27;t see it on cable any time soon.
This is a movie that takes something simple, stretches it as far as it
will go, and actually does a really good job with it. There&#x27;s chemistry
amongst the entire cast, the make-up effects are really fantastic for a
budget so small, and Rutger Hauer makes the audiences of today take
notice of a 67 year old actor. It&#x27;s bloody, excessive, and probably one
of the easiest movies to turn your brain off during. Hobo with a
Shotgun is a violently induced bloodbath that&#x27;ll leave you joyously
picking its impact out of your hair and clothes for days.
