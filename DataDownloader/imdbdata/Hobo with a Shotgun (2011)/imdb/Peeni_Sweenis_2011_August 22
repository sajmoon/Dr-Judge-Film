Hobo with a shotgun is exactly what you would expect it to be, a gore
filled movie with outrageous action and violence. This movie is never
going to win a movie for best plot or anything of the nature, but it is
not meant to, it is just a movie to sit back, relax, and watch some
intense over the top gore that the whole &#x27;grindhouse&#x27; genre is known
for. I found my self laughing at a couple of points in the film at to
how ridiculous it became in spots, but then again, that is what they
went for when making this movie. If you have a semi-decent tolerance to
gore, a twisted sense of humor, and an hour and a half to kill, check
out Hobo. It is a pretty decent turn your brain off action film, with
some absurdly hilarious scenes.
