It&#x27;s not very often that a film can leave you so satisfied, so happy,
feeling so warm inside, that when it&#x27;s over it has a physical effect on
you. When Hobo with a Shotgun was over I was disoriented, I had trouble
standing and my speech was slurred. I was unresponsive. I didn&#x27;t know
what to do with my life. But this was a good thing.<br /><br />I honestly felt like a portion of my childhood was amputated from my
soul and Jason Eisener was the surgeon. I made a note to shake his hand
and thank him for this after the show. Then I headed home and went
directly to sleep, because I found myself unable to do anything else.
Now that I&#x27;m well-rested both mentally and physically, I can review
Hobo with a Shotgun.<br /><br />Rutger Hauer plays a nameless vagabond who finds himself in &#x22;Hopetown&#x22;,
a city ripe with crime and disorder. It&#x27;s run by a kingpin named Drake
(Brian Downey), an insane sadist completely lacking in empathy or
morality, with the adorable personality of a game show host. His two
sons, Ivan (Nick Bateman) and Slick (Gregory Smith) take after their
father, and do most of his dirty work.<br /><br />The Hobo tries his best to ignore the madness going on around him,
hoping to raise enough money to buy a lawnmower and start his own
business. However, when he meets a prostitute named Abby (Molly
Dunsworth) and pulls a Pootie Tang on one of Drake&#x27;s sons, he goes on a
vendetta against the scum of Hopetown. After coming across the titular
shotgun, the Hobo vows to clean up the city, one shell at a time.<br /><br />There really isn&#x27;t anything else I want to tell you about the plot, I
don&#x27;t want to spoil any of the countless special effects and death
scenes. But believe me when I say that every scene has something in it
that&#x27;ll make you smile. Oh, by the way, take &#x22;the line&#x22; and throw it
out of the window. This film doesn&#x27;t cross the line, because there is
no line to be crossed to begin with. Hobo with a Shotgun is its own
film, with its own rules. Jason Eisener made a note to tell that to the
audience before the show, and it&#x27;s absolutely true.<br /><br />This is a film for everyone, everywhere, but it&#x27;s really something
special if you live in Halifax. Being filmed here, you&#x27;ll notice icons
like the Angus L. MacDonald Bridge and the Purdy&#x27;s Wharf towers that
really make it seem like Hopetown is home. Keep your eyes peeled if
you&#x27;re a Trailer Park Boys fan too.<br /><br />The acting was great, the special effects &#x26; gore was cool, and the film
was done really well. That&#x27;s all I need to say. I gave this film 10/10
because it met every expectation I had, and exceeded it. Everyone
involved did a fantastic job.
