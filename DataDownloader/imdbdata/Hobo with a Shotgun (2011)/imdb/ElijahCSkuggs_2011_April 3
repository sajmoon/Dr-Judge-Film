Bloody babe: &#x22;You can&#x27;t save the world with a shotgun.&#x22; <br /><br />Hobo: &#x22;It&#x27;s the only thing I know.&#x22; <br /><br />It&#x27;s true. Once he put that shotgun in his Hobo mittens he and shotgun
became one. From this moment forth, whenever you hear the word, Hobo,
you will always think, Shotgun. The shotgun is the Yang to the Hobo&#x27;s
Ying.<br /><br />Rutger Hauer plays the slightly-losing it old hobo who after decades
has finally realized what he wants to do with his life - be a
landscaper; he wants to mow lawns. So, on his ventures of hoboing up
and down the railroad tracks looking for a means to a beginning, he&#x27;s
arrived at &#x27;Scumtown&#x27;, and this is where he meets up with trusty ole
Shotgun.<br /><br />See, Scumtown is controlled by Drake and Sons. Three psychopathic dudes
who get serious kicks out of decapitation, burn victims and simply put,
gore. Confused ole Rutger the Hobo is privy to just one too many counts
of evil and puts his shoe (with the hole in the toe) down. What follows
is a tale of revenge, then more revenge and then...some more! Blood! <br /><br />On the over-the-top action and splatter, this movie delivers big time.
It&#x27;s basically non-stop offensive, silly, gross action. But what makes
it stand-out over any other recent modern exploit flick is the style it
moves with. Karim Hussain of Subconscious Cruelty fame helms the camera
here and does a very good job doing so. It&#x27;s vibrant, colorful, and had
just enough creativity to raise an eye brow or two.<br /><br />Any real gripes by me are related to the writing as that it&#x27;s so
supremely OTT with countless swears and screaming it verges on
head-ache worthy. And the emotional scenes are so sappy and clich&#xE9; that
it does nothing besides make ya roll yer eyes or crack a grin. So, with
that said, it&#x27;s not really complaints per se, but just silly aspects of
the film that wear thin faster than the others.<br /><br />As I said, from this moment on, the Hobo Shotgun duo are now joined at
the hips - if it wasn&#x27;t already. This is a bona-fide insane film with
boner-fried sights (literally) and lots of the red stuff. You really
can&#x27;t ask for much more from this film, and maybe, you might be asking
for less.
