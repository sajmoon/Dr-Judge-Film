What happened to Rutger Hauer? Is this the same man who made BLADE
RUNNER such a great film? This is simply an awful film, badly written,
badly acted, terrible photography, poor sets, poor special effects,
terrible music, and all following a mindless and ultimately meaningless
storyline! Somewhere around the middle of the film, I thought that
perhaps this was supposed to be some sort of spoof, but really, this is
not remotely laughable. As much fun as a root canal. True enough, I
didn&#x27;t have high expectations regarding this film but decided to see it
just because Rutger Hauer was in it. Boy, what a mistake.<br /><br />This is just a pathetic film that should be avoided like the proverbial
PLAGUE that&#x27;s used in the film. It&#x27;s also very, very sad to see this
sort of trash being made in Canada. Our film industry should know
better...<br /><br />Save yourself from this colossal waste of time. It&#x27;s not even worth
&#x22;camp&#x22; value.
