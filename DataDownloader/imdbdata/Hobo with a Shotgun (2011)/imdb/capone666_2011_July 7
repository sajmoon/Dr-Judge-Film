Hobo with a Shotgun<br /><br />Finally, homeless people have realized that they can get more spare
change with a shotgun, than they ever could with a cardboard sign.<br /><br />Oops! Apparently the motive of the migrant in this action movie isn&#x27;t
armed panhandling, but administering street justice.<br /><br />Arriving in Scum Town aboard a boxcar, a grizzled hobo (Rutger Hauer)
enters a totalitarian township controlled by the sadistic The Drake
(Brian Downey) and his two sons, Slick and Ivan (Gregory Smith, Nick
Bateman). <br /><br />Successful with keeping a low profile at first, after witnessing too
many atrocities at the hand of The Drake, the hobo cock&#x27;s a shogun in
revolt.<br /><br />Based on the fictional trailer that appeared in the 2007 movie
Grindhouse, this all-Canadian homage to the exploitative genre is a
shopping cart brimming with optimal one-liners, over- the-top acting
and buckets of bad taste. <br /><br />Nevertheless, the most beneficial accoutrement for any homeless person
remains: a mobile debit machine. (Green Light)
