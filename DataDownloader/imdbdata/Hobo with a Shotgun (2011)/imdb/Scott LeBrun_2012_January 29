Director / editor Jason Eisener and writer John Davies&#x27;s popular modern
exploitation flick derives its entertainment value mainly from its
go-for-broke, take-it-to-the-extreme mentality. Basically, it&#x27;s because
it&#x27;s so over the top that makes it as much fun as it is for an
exploitation fan such as this viewer. Granted, it&#x27;s clearly not suited
to all tastes, but it&#x27;s definitely got its heart in the right place and
the pacing never flags. Expanded from the faux trailer hatched by
Eisener, Davies, and producer Rob Cotterill for competition in Robert
Rodriguez&#x27;s Grindhouse contest, the title makes the high concept story
quite clear. Veteran actor Rutger Hauer is aces in the title role, his
best in a long time. He&#x27;s come to a city via rail (to the strains of
Michael Holm&#x27;s theme from the 1970 movie &#x22;Mark of the Devil&#x22;) that is
appropriately dubbed &#x22;Scum Town&#x22;; it&#x27;s a stylized, ugly urban Hell
presided over by an omnipotent criminal, played by a hilariously campy
Brian Downey, who refers to himself as The Drake. His two sons, Slick
and Ivan, are two seriously demented cretins themselves, and are played
by Gregory Smith and Nick Bateman. Eventually, The Hobo, who only
wanted to buy a lawnmower and start himself a little business, can take
no more of the unrelenting crime, filth, and despair around him and
doles out some brutal punishment. When seeing some scenes, such as the
public execution of The Drake&#x27;s own brother (portrayed by &#x27;Trailer Park
Boys&#x27; actor Robb Wells in a cameo), soon to be followed by a shot of a
young woman bathing herself in the resulting blood spray, or the
infamous sequence involving flamethrowers, a school bus full of
children, and the song &#x22;Disco Inferno&#x22;, one can see what the movie is
all about. It refrains from making obvious throwback references - such
as contriving a beat up look for the print - in favour of having the
actors play the material straight and never quite winking at the
viewers. In fact, Hauer&#x27;s big standout scene has him giving a rather
heartfelt speech to some newborn infants, and the connection that he
makes with hard luck prostitute Abby (sexy Molly Dunsworth) is quite
touching. The carnage is plentiful and just delicious, with the red
stuff spurting all over the place and assorted body parts getting
utterly mangled. The widescreen cinematography by Karim Hussain and the
production design by Ewen Dickson, in addition to the location filming
in Halifax and Darthmouth in Nova Scotia give &#x22;Hobo with a Shotgun&#x22; a
great look. The two &#x22;man&#x22; team known as The Plague are also a fine
touch. As utterly crazed escapism goes, it&#x27;s hard to beat a movie with
this much pizazz. At the least, it&#x27;s wonderful to see Hauer kicking so
much ass. David Brunt, the original Hobo from the trailer, also makes a
cameo appearance as the dirty cop. Eight out of 10.
