Hobo With a Shotgun easily disguises itself as a cheesy, over-the-top
action flick that aims for entertainment rather than something
symbolic. Unexpectedly, you find the film something that can be looked
through what it&#x27;s intending to be.<br /><br />Sure, it&#x27;s that same old message about society again. But the message
is brutalized, and answered with a 12 gauge (or whatever the hell it&#x27;s
called, I&#x27;m not a gun expert) as a voice to even the dumbest of them
all. Instead of 30 minutes of yawn- worthy dialogue, it shoots straight
into bloodshed. Wow, an *entertaining* message.<br /><br />Rutger Hauer and Molly Dunsworth make great leads, managing to make
sweet chemistry. You definitely feel out to them, as their situations
intensify to sadder, gorier conclusions. The rest of the cast are just
as great.<br /><br />This is what I love about these kind of movies. They just have a simple
idea that grows and grows with every scene. Hobo With a Shotgun is fun,
bloody and even touching.<br /><br />Try and note the Hobo&#x27;s brilliant speech at the hospital.
