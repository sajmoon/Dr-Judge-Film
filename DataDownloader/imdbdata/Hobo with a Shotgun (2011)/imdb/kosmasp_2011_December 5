You may have seen the &#x22;fake&#x22; trailer for a movie called &#x22;Hobo with a
shotgun&#x22;. This trailer was made for a competition. And Mr. Eisner won
that competition. Still as he is eager to tell anyone, producers were
reluctant to grant him money to do a full length movie (which
incidentally is/was the first prize).<br /><br />So he did a short called Treevenge, to show people he could handle a
movie production. And as many have witnessed online (that video got
many hits), he tackled that very well. And then he got lucky. He said
that he was a big fun of Rutger Hauer. And somehow Rutger Hauer got
involved in the project (taking the reins from the non-actor who played
the lead in the fake trailer).<br /><br />While this back-story is fascinating, it almost overshadows the movie
itself. The movie itself is pure pulp (framed by the ever reliable
Karim Hussain), with a lot of things in it to offend people. Rutger
Hauer was delighted to play the role (and he is really good in it), but
all the splatter effects cannot hide that something is indeed missing
from this movie ...
