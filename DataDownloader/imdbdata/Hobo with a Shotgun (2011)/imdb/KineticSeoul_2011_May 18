When I first saw the trailer to this while watching &#x22;Grindhouse&#x22; 2007,
I thought there would be a very slim chance for this movie to come
about. So I can&#x27;t say I wasn&#x27;t surprised when this movie actually came
out as a full feature movie. Like &#x22;Machete&#x22; 2010 this movie has the
&#x22;Grindhouse&#x22; feel to it with tons of blood and gore, while looking
really cheap. Especially the camera work and cinematography but it
brings those old school exploitation film style back. This is one of
those movies you just can&#x27;t go super critic on and nit pic everything
about it, but accept it for what it is, like it or hate it. Plus the
movie is low budget which Grindhouse movies are known for with a lot of
gratuitous violence in it in most cases. This movie really has the
grimy and nasty look going for it which adds to the grittiness of it
all. For anyone looking for a true exploitation style movie, this one
is worth checking out.<br /><br />6.3/10
