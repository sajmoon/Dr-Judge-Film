Hobo with a Shotgun is so intent on being vulgar that it forgot to be
clever. What at first promised satire delivered slop. You&#x27;d be hard
pressed to find an exploitation flick that doesn&#x27;t go over the top, but
this one goes so far over the top that it draws awareness to the film
makers obvious incompetence. This is a movie strictly for the brain
dead and/or the stoned. <br /><br />Having seen the film, it&#x27;s hard to say whether the film is meant to be
taken seriously or not. The overall lack of humour (more commonly seen
in the Tarantino/Rodriguez collaborations) is a critical mistake.
Without it, the film just feels repulsive and amateurish. To further
support my case, it&#x27;s important to note that Hobo with a Shotgun is
almost devoid of plot. Ninety percent of the script is humourless
profanity, with a couple of lame monologues thrown in between. The
acting is a joke, and the ending makes the whole thing seem pointless
... which it is.
