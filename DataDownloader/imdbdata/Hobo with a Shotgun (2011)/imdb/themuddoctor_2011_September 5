If you&#x27;re going to make a Z-grade exploitation movie, you have to do it
right. Don&#x27;t be too ironic or self-conscious; just dive into the smut
headfirst and revel in it. Jason Eisner&#x27;s Hobo With a Shotgun does a
triple back flip off the diving tower into the smut and rolls gleefully
around in it. Originally produced by the filmmakers as a fake trailer
for 2007&#x27;s Grindhouse, the feature-length Hobo actually turns out to be
a better example of the kind of grindhouse fare the film aimed to
represent than the Robert Rodriguez half, Planet Terror. We meet our
titular hobo arriving in a small town on a train at the beginning of
the film. Read my full review at:
