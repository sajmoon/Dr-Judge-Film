Dialogue:<br /><br />&#x22;You can&#x27;t save the world with a shotgun.&#x22; &#x22;It&#x27;s the only thing I
know.&#x22;<br /><br />The writers must have had a (shotgun) blast making this manuscript!<br /><br />Hehe... this was a breath of &#x22;fresh&#x22; air. Not been too many splatter
movies out lately and this one didn&#x27;t intend to be more than it was
either.<br /><br />Glad to see one of the cool actors from the 80&#x27;s back.<br /><br />I guess with The Hitcher and now this, Rutger Hauer has gone full
circle!
