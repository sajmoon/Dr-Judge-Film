Bloody red mayhem, Grindhouse style, is the key to laughing at Hobo
with a Shotgun, a tribute to all the slasher, exploitation B movies
that prospered in the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s. Those &#x27;80&#x27;s were the heyday of the
film&#x27;s star, Rutger Hauer, a hulking blond haired, blue eyed madman
with a sense of humor.<br /><br />Hauer&#x27;s Hobo sees violence in the city that starts with rowdyism and
ends in a severed head with other atrocities. Eventually he befriends a
needy prostitute and metes out vigilante justice with the titular gun.
The eventual object is the Drake family, father and two sons holding
the city hostage to its unfettered violence, a bit like Saddam in his
heyday.<br /><br />After its audience has seen all the blood its needs (about 30 min), it
can enjoy the little quips tossed off in the atmosphere of amorality:
Hobo:&#x22; Put the knife away, kid... or I&#x27;ll use it to cut welfare checks
from your rotten skin!&#x22; But really, nothing makes sense except that
Hauer is the best Hobo with a Gun anyone will ever see.<br /><br />Hobo: &#x22;You and me are going on a car-ride to hell... and you&#x27;re riding
shotgun!&#x22;
