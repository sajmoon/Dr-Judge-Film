First of all I want to say that if you don&#x27;t like gore sadistic movies,
which contains explicit violence every 5 minutes, then this isn&#x27;t a
movie for you. Are you open minded or a fan of grind house/
exploitation movies with cheesy dialogs, bad acting and villains who
are intensely evil. Then this is something you need to see! <br /><br />The story is quiet easy. A hobo (Rutger Hauer) comes to a town full
with scum who is ruled by a sort of gangster named &#x22;the Drake&#x22;. He and
his two sadistic sons Ivan and Slick makes life in this city impossible
by murdering around and dealing drugs. When the hobo arrives he is
surprised and stays passive against all the scum. When he wants to buy
a lawn mower to start a business, three guys come in to rob the store.
The hobo grabs the shotgun which stands in the store and kill the three
guys. With the help of a young whore named Abby he cleans the city from
the scum.<br /><br />This movie is made with a smile and gives you a smile. The movie itself
is not a comedy but it&#x27;s more the way it is made. Everything is so bad
that it is good. The acting, the violence, the cheesy dialogs and of
course the villains. The movie doesn&#x27;t take itself to serious and
that&#x27;s the strength of the movie. Although the movie consists of a lot
of sadistic violence and tons of blood it doesn&#x27;t give u a feeling of
watching away, perhaps only in one or two scene&#x27;s. It&#x27;s all over the
top and done in a way of Peter Jackson&#x27;s Brain dead, very cartoony but
in a very nice way. But this all is made with so much love and fun that
you will leave the theater with a good feeling!<br /><br />Go see this movie!
