Yes, it was made in 2010. That&#x27;s my little joke. They have SO PERFECTLY
captured the vibe of 1970&#x27;s and 1980&#x27;s over-the-top exploitation, low
budget, direct-to-VHS features that they have blown out of the water
similar recent efforts such as MACHETE, TERROR PLANET and DEATH PROOF.
From the whole script, to the casting of Rutger Hauer, to the
ridiculous gore effects, down to the SUPER ANNOYING synthesizer-based
music score (including really awful guitar heavy Pop/AOR closing theme
song that sounded like Pat Benatar&#x27;s waste bin scrapings), the whole
experience is summed up in a nutshell right here.<br /><br />Not sure if they issued this film on VHS in a large plastic clamshell
box (since I saw it on Netflix), but they should have done that to get
the 1987 vibe nailed down to the last detail. The only part I had some
complaint about was their attempt to make Halifax, Nova Scotia look
like a bombed-out New York City of the 1970&#x27;s, seen in such clas-sicks
as THE WARRIORS, TENEMENT, DEATH WISH 3, or NIGHT OF THE JUGGLER. That
didn&#x27;t QUITE work for me, but they did give it their all.<br /><br />I have to give kudos to the writing, acting and directing. All
appropriately histrionic, teeth-clenched and overbearing for the genre.
This flick starts off at &#x22;over-the-top&#x22; then launches into the
stratosphere with not scenery chewing, but swallowing scenery whole. On
the whole, a lovable, invigorating, disgusting throwback to an era of
movie making that&#x27;s pretty well vanished by this point. Yes,
exploitation goes on. Yes, low budget films go on. Yes, films laden
with gore go onward. But this film hearkens back to a time when this
whole approach was bold, daring and untried before. And that makes it
at least worthy of consideration.<br /><br />If you like exploitation films, it&#x27;s a 9 out of 10. If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;d
better skip it.
