With its origins as the lesser known fake trailer of Rodriguez &#x26;
Tarantino&#x27;s Grindhouse, this film delivers exactly what you might
expect. The story follows the familiar formula of westerns such as A
Fistful of Dollars, as Rutger Hauer&#x27;s Hobo enters the ironically named
Hopetown, witnesses the chaos as criminals have free reign, and decides
to take the law into his own hands, &#x22;delivering justice one shell at a
time&#x22;.<br /><br />For a film with such an absurd title and premise, the tension is racked
up and it pulls you in straight from the opening scene as we are
introduced to the merciless Drake (Brian Downey) and his two sons Slick
and Ivan (Gregory Smith &#x26; Nick Bateman respectively), some of fiction&#x27;s
most viscous villains. The typical characters you find on &#x27;best
villain&#x27; lists &#x96; Darth Vader, Hannibal Lecter, Lord Voldemort to name a
few &#x96; at least have an element of human in them, but you certainly
wouldn&#x27;t want Drake and his sons (or any minor criminal in the town for
that matter) to get their hands on you. Even the armoured samurai-like
demonic soldiers that Drake summons, The Plague, seem a preferable
opponent. But at least there&#x27;s still hope in Hopetown (yes I said it)
as the headlines read &#x22;Hobo stops begging, demands change&#x22;.<br /><br />Hobo with a Shotgun is comparable to the other Grindhouse films in its
ridiculousness but as pure enjoyment goes, it is far superior and
coming from an unknown director seems more genuine as a B-movie. Rutger
Hauer brilliantly underplays the Hobo, just trying to get to grips with
the tough world he lives in, contrasting the exaggeration of the
remaining characters, including the cartoonish Ivan, and Molly
Dunsworth as prostitute Abby who screams the most chilling cries of
rage and delivers a near-inspirational speech defending the homeless,
&#x22;they got the biggest home of any of us, it&#x27;s called the streets!&#x22; For
those looking for a high-paced insanely mindless movie, and who found
Planet Terror, Death Proof, or Machete lacking something, Hobo with a
Shotgun may be the most entertaining film released in years.
