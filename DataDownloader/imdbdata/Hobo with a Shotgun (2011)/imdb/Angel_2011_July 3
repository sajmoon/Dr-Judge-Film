After watching trailers for films like this numerous times you see
through some of the camp acting and excessive violence. In a great
tradition of the Grindhouse feel this film delivers on all of your
expectations. If you enjoyed Machete then you&#x27;ll probably love this
movie....matter of fact, if you didn&#x27;t enjoy Machete you&#x27;ll probably
enjoy this film. Rutger Hauer as an actor is great and delivers a
fantastic performance in the film. If your easily offended, not a fan
of the Grindhouse series of films, or are looking for a deep love
story, this movie is not for you. Excessive and wonderful gore, this is
truly a fan film and bound to be on the cult collectors shelf years
from now. Cinematography is top notch wonderfully filmed. Definitely
worth watching, pleasantly surprised.
