I don&#x27;t know what it is about titles like this, but there&#x27;s some base,
self-punishing part of me that won&#x27;t let me pass this kind of thing by
without taking a look. I know it&#x27;s likely to be bad in almost all
departments, and will possess little in the way of merit, but &#x96; well,
there you go &#x96; some people sit alone in their bedrooms cutting up their
legs with razor blades, I subject myself to worthless trash like this
when the other half&#x27;s gone to bed. <br /><br />Hobo with a Shotgun isn&#x27;t a complete loss. Rutger Hauer &#x96; looking
pretty grizzled and weather-beaten these days &#x96; is pretty good in the
title role; the use of saturated colour gives the film a fresh,
original look that&#x27;s deliberately at odds with the subject matter; and
a few key scenes shine like diamonds in a pile of manure, but the
filmmakers have no idea about when the time is right to take a step
back so that we can lift our heads and take a breath for a moment
before being submerged once more in their foul world of violence and
gore. <br /><br />Excess for its own sake is a pretty juvenile practice, so anyone over
the age of twenty-five will probably be turned off by this.
