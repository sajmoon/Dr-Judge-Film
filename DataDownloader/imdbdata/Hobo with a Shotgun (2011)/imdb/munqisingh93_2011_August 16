I can&#x27;t fathom how this scored a 6.4 here and a 67% critics rating at
Rotten Tomatoes. But even the worst reviews are too kind. This movie is
a complete wreck. The only thing missing was riffing by Mike or Joel
and the Bots. In fact, nothing I&#x27;ve seen riffed on MST3K or RiffTrax is
any worse than this.<br /><br />At first I thought this was some kind of joke, that the comedy was
intentional. But after about half an hour of this dreck, I was dismayed
to discover even Rutger Hauer was playing it totally straight.<br /><br />Just a thoroughly awful film. Possibly at the very bottom of a long
list of truly wretched films.
