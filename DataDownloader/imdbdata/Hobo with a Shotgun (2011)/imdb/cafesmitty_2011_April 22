This was a must see, because after all, it is called Hobo With A
Shotgun, HOWEVER, it is not a well done movie at all. Here is the
premise of the movie, what if someone made a Quentin Tarantino or
Robert Rodriquez film without their talent. This is what you get with
this film. The people who rate this film high have lost their minds.
The problem is the actors don&#x27;t seem to believe it. Their characters
act cartoony and thats the difference between something like Planet
Terror. So now I know to watch out for cool sounding titles, because it
is not the title or the subject matter, it is who directs it. But if
you must see if, please wait for it to come on HBO or Netflix instant
streaming, but do not buy, do not rent, just watch when it becomes
available. Because trust me, this is no Machete, it is no Death Proof,
it is truly a pretender with a director who has no idea on how to
direct and with a writer who storyline was pretty garbage for a movie
with such a basic concept. How in the world do you screw up a movie
called Hobo With A Shotgun? Easily, have this moronic director make it.<br /><br />One of the other main problem is that it isn&#x27;t fun, at all. It&#x27;s
violence for the sake of violence with no point. And I have a tolerance
for many things, but there are some scene (such as a bus, scene, not
giving anything away), that I found reprehensible. No one, not even
Rutger Hauer was believable and if this is satire, it didn&#x27;t come
through, it is just exploitive. Guys, do yourself a huge huge favor and
DO NOT subject your wives, children, girlfriends, dates or any females
you know to this nonsense or you will forever be in the doghouse. They
will never forgive you and it will always be brought up throughout the
rest of your future history (remember when you insisted on watching
that Hobo Shotgun movie). Me and my male friends watched it and we
loved Machete but hated, hated this.
