I like an over-the-top film every now-and-then. I loved Drive Angry 3D
- as you knew exactly what you were going to get, and it delivered.
Saying that; I wasn&#x27;t a fan of Machete. <br /><br />Hobo with a Shotgun is a great film. Sure, it&#x27;s shocking and the gore
is messy - but that&#x27;s what it promises to do. This will never win
awards, and nor should it - but I&#x27;m proud to add it to my collection.<br /><br />Sadly, some movies made in the same way as this often look terrible and
end up on Syfy. You can tell that this has had attention and desire
from makers that worship the genre. On Blu-ray this looks great, and
not grainy like similar titles. Plus the song on the end credits is
beautifully retro and fitting.<br /><br />Recommended.
