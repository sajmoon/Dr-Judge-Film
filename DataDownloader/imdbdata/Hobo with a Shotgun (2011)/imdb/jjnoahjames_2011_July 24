Hobo takes us on a journey with Hobo and Abby. Two really friendly
characters and shows us how they deal with an extremely brutal world.<br /><br />The journey has that simplistic 80&#x27;s feel, a script you&#x27;ve watched
before if your over 25. But it&#x27;s one I haven&#x27;t seen in awhile except
maybe in The Book of Eli (one of the best movies of the year by the
way). <br /><br />I can see where the directors were going with this film at times as
there are many cool 80&#x27;s trendy elements, like a girl with weapons,80&#x27;s
slap bracelets, 80&#x27;s music, and two evil characters, The Plague, who
remind you of TMNT characters in a kinda good way.<br /><br />On the negative this movie is the opposite of Book of Eli in a lot of
ways. One of the most annoying things about this film is the &#x22;cursing&#x22;
I mean the F-Bomb only has an effect the first couple times than it
becomes cheesy. The F-Bomb is dropped so many times you can notice the
actors have trouble making it believable (it def helped ruin the
movie), also the character Ivan&#x27;s B-Movie acting was a little annoying. <br /><br />I feel that with just a little bit more work, this could have been an
amazing movie, though it&#x27;s still good. If you&#x27;re in the mood for
something different, like I was, this is certainly fresh in a bloody
kinda way!
