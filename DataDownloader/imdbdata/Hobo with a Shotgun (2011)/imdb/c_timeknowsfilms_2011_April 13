The reason I gave this film a full 10 is because this film is a blast
from beginning to end. It really gets the Adrenaline pumping and the
heart pounding. With it&#x27;s over the top violence and crude visuals this
film is a must see for those of you who grew up watching exploitation
films. These types of films were made famous around the late 70&#x27;s to
early 80&#x27;s. It&#x27;s a fun film to watch and I cannot say that there are
many movies that do that for me anymore. The film was originally a mock
trailer for Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s Grindhouse film
competition. Jason Eisner&#x27;s respective trailer Hobo with a Shotgun had
won the contest. Growing up watching films like that of Hobo was a
treat because this film brought me back to such classics as the Toxic
Avenger and Evil Dead, it was a refreshing take and made me leaving
wanting more. I highly recommend this film.
