This is a great example of a movie that is made to be corny, cheesy and
fun to watch!<br /><br />It was like watching a B movie 80&#x27;s horror BUT it is meant to be that
way instead of the usual happening where the movie was seriously made
and you can&#x27;t help but cringe at how bad it is!<br /><br />Rutger Hauer is great as the hobo, funny as hell! I remember &#x27;ol Rutger
from wedlock and other decades old films of his so to see him in this
is hilarious and couldn&#x27;t help think what a great actor for agreeing to
make this film (ok the real life truth is something different, money
and fame, but i like my version of reality!)...quality!<br /><br />I don&#x27;t want to give away any spoilers and would just recommend that
you watch it and remember it is meant to be a horror spoof kind of
thing, so leave your serious head at the door...this film genre is a
bit like machete i guess except machete sucks and this one doesn&#x27;t...
