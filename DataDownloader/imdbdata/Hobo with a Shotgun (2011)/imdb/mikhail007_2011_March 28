As the title suggests this movie is about a homeless man with a shotgun
bringing justice to a corrupt town. Nothing more and nothing less. The
movie is filled with gory and over-the-top death scenes which are
mostly pretty entertaining. And this is what this movie is mostly
about. There is a story line but its purpose is only to string the
violent acts together. There is not much character depth. The villains
are evil with not much purpose to their evilness. But that&#x27;s what you
expect from this type of movie. The acting is descent but not
outstanding. Although, Rutger Hauer, who plays the hobo, is absolutely
phenomenal in his role.<br /><br />This movie pays homage to the Grindhouse genre, and is very reminiscent
of Tarantino&#x27;s and Rodriguez&#x27;s &#x22;Grindhouse&#x22; movie which too pay homage
to this genre. In fact &#x22;Hobo with a Shotgun&#x22; was one of the fake
trailers in &#x22;Grindhouse&#x22;. However, &#x22;Hobo with a Shotgun&#x22; doesn&#x27;t quite
live up to the standards set by Tarantino and Rodriguez. The kills
don&#x27;t have as much style and dialogues lack certain edge and
liveliness.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is descent. Check your brain at the door and enjoy
the gory ride.
