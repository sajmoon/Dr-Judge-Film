I don&#x27;t want to rate this movie, because I think it&#x27;s below the rating.
It was probably made either a wannabe artist without understanding the
concept of movie shows, or some one looking to see what kind of garbage
people would like to see. No plot, no decent dialogs, no attractive
characters - no nothing. Just blood and dirt - something which I would
have loved in a different concept. This movie gave me strong feeling of
absolute disgust towards the world in general and movies in specific.
It was so incredibly stupid and pointless, and so
&#x22;cheap-horror&#x22;\Tarantino movie bloody, that even despite not having
children, I actually started to worry about morals of a new generation.
No child should EVER see this crap. I some will tell me this is art -
In my eyes this man will be intellectually reduced to blubbering
monkey. I have to fill at least 10 lines so...: Bad. Really bad.
Absolute crap. yada yada yada....
