I came into this movie hoping for a slew of cheap effects, bad acting,
and even worse script-writing...well, i got all of that, unfortunately,
the gore level was so high and so explicit i didn&#x27;t laugh too much.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I enjoy a gory flick, but there are lines that
should never be crossed. Scenes such as a whole school bus of children
being burned alive, a girl having her hand forced into a lawnmower, and
women dancing around a spray of blood, almost made me want to walk out
of the theatre. there are things that should not be allowed to be
scripted.<br /><br />A hobo has been travelling most of his life, trying to find a decent
city to live in. most places he goes he doesn&#x27;t like, until he ends up
in hopetown, which is the worst place in the world. In his first day,
he witnesses a man (played by Robb Wells, known to Canadians as Ricky
from the Trailer Park Boys) getting decapitated by the town&#x27;s goons. He
witnesses crime after crime, including one of the biggest goons
harassing a prostitute (played by Molly Dunsworth. if you recognize the
name, she is related to Sara and John Dunsworth, who were also on
trailer park boys) and brings the goon in, and talks with the police
chief (played by the guy who testifies against the trailer park boys in
the episode where they open an illegal gas station) who throws him out
with the help of the goon, and a cop who looks a lot like Sam losco
(wait, it was Sam losco) when he makes enough money to buy a lawnmower
and start a business, his trip to the pawnshop turns into a battle of
survival, when 3 criminals attempt to rob the place, and kill a mother.
he instead grabs a loaded shotgun, and takes matters into his own
hands. from there, the hobo with a shotgun is born.<br /><br />If you haven&#x27;t guessed, this film is Canadian, and it&#x27;s opening and
closing credits feel like they belong to a early to mid 80&#x27;s movie.
also, a lot of the people who worked on trailer park boys are part of
the film. that&#x27;s half the reason i went to see this, but i was
disappointed to see Ricky die off so early.<br /><br />If you&#x27;re a gore junkie, this might be your kind of film, but for
everyone else, steer clear if you don&#x27;t want to feel like you wasted
some money.
