I&#x27;m no stranger to movies of gore, camp, and piggy bank budgets. From
Browning&#x27;s Freaks, through Mr. Corman, to Tarrantino&#x27;s Grindhouse I
usually adore movies of this ilk. Unfortunately Mr. Eisner&#x27;s forcefully
contrived Technicolor mess is not worthy of a campy title such as this.
It is not clever nor is it witty. It seems as if it is a cry for
psychological help as the director plasters gore on the screen with
platitudinal catch-phrases. Among the main character&#x27;s enemies are two
immediately unlikeable folks that possess the charisma of 1980&#x27;s ski
race movie antagonists. These characters, among their many faults,
flamethrow a school bus full of children to help persuade you to
dislike them. This illustrates that Eisner &#x26; Co. do not discriminate
with senseless violence because it is clearly demonstrated that all can
be butchered very equally, including women and children. Rutger Hauer
has many enemies in this tragic eyesore but the real enemy is the
viewer.
