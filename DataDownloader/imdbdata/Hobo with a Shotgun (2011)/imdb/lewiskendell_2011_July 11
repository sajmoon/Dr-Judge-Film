&#x22;I&#x27;m gonna wash this blood off with YOUR blood.&#x22;<br /><br />Remember that initial contest-winning Hobo with a Shotgun trailer? The
movie uses that as a starting point, and then proceeds to get way
weirder, gorier, more over the top, and very zany. I wouldn&#x27;t call this
a &#x22;good&#x22; movie, but it is very entertaining in spots, and it&#x27;s creative
enough to keep the joke going beyond the simple premise of the
trailer.&#xA0;<br /><br />Just be prepared for a lot of blood, truly funny dialogue and a lot of
equally opportunity violence. No one is safe in Hope Town, including
heroes, heroines, kids, and everyone in-between. If you&#x27;re anything
like me, you won&#x27;t be able to help chuckling at how laughably extreme
the violence gets at times, it reminded me of one of the gory Japanese
flicks like The Machine Girl more than anything else.&#xA0;<br /><br />Don&#x27;t expect a lot from Hobo with a Shotgun, just a lot more (and more,
and more) of the faux-grindhouse carnage that the trailer offered. I
think I like the idea that a movie like this can be made more than I
like the actual movie.&#xA0;
