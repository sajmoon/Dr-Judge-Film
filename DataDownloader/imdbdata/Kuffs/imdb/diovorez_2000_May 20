This movie is one of my favorites. I saw one scene of it (the dry cleaning
store scene) when I was 8, but I was too young to care. Fast-forward to
about 2 weeks ago, when my mom rented me some movies, and I fell in love
with Kuffs.<br /><br />Christian Slater pretty much plays the same character: a smart-alec with the
ability to kick some @$$. I love the way he can play that role in this
movie, with a hilarious joke or monologue to the viewers just about every
other minute!<br /><br />Sure, it has its rough spots: the action could have been better, and I would
have liked to see a little more of Milla Jovovich, but overall, it's a
winner. <br /><br />I give it a 9 out of 10.
