&quot;Kuffs&quot; is a fun, slick action-comedy that you just appreciate for what it
is.  It doesn't even make an attempt to be a landmark cop movie like &quot;48
Hours&quot; or &quot;Lethal Weapon,&quot; and that's what it makes it work.  It's
tongue-in-cheek and completely unpretentious.  And Christian Slater is the
glue that holds this film together.  He's one of my favorite actors (who's
quite underrated) and it's his credible, charming, charismatic performance
that really makes this film tick.  Though this is not one of his serious
character roles, he seems to be having a lot of fun and really entertains us
with his effervescent presence.  <br /><br />The moment you see Slater talking to the camera in the opening scene, you
know this is not a movie to be taken seriously.  In fact, this can even be
classified as a farce.  The material doesn't always seem suited for the big
screen (more for the small screen in a TV cop show), but big screen or not
it's damn entertaining.  My only criticisms are a few cartoonish scenes
which are just plain silly, one being Tony Goldwyn drinking coffee spiked
with narcotics and stomping around like a Looney Tunes character. <br /><br />Milla Jovovich is beautiful to look at, the humor is often fresh and funny,
Slater is very entertaining and there's some exciting action to boot. 
Sounds good?  It does to me.  <br /><br />My score:  7 (out of 10)
