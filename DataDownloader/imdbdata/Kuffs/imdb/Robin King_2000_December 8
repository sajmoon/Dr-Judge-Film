2000_December 8 

I was flicking through the admittedly poor choice of channels that we have
as an excuse for terrestrial broadcasting in this country, when I stumbled
across this patent waste of celluloid. From the moment Slater addressed
the
camera I was cringing, and then when the Turkey got run over - well, I
almost fell out of bed with the sheer banality of it all. When it first
started, I thought any film with Jovovich in it couldn't possibly be all
bad, but I was proved wrong. The Slater from Heathers and Pump Up The
Volume
please come back - all is forgiven.
