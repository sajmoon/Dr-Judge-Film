Kuffs is an outstanding movie,Christian Slater continues to &quot;wow&quot;
me.This film has comedy,action AND romance.It sets of with
Kuffs(Slater)dancing around his living room with his girlfriend(Milla
Jovovich),who drops a bombshell that she is pregnant,thinking kuffs
would be happy,boy was she wrong!Right from the start this movie made
me laugh.He then leaves his pregnant girlfriend in search of his
policeman brother,who owns a precinct called the Patrol Specials,Kuffs
went looking for him to try and borrow money but instead was offered a
job with his brother,which he politely declined until his brother was
shot dead by the local crime king.Kuffs takes over his brothers
business,his only interest....REVENGE,i don&#39;t want to give too much
away,so please sit back and enjoy a magnificent movie,an easy10/10.
