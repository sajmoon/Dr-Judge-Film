George Kuffs is a lay about who doesn't have a steady job or a life plan. 
His brother owns a privatised police precinct and wants George to come and
work for him.  When George sees his brother killed by a criminal he finds he
has inherited the precinct.  He decides to run it the best he can and clean
up the neighbourhood at the same time.  It's not long before revenge is on
the cards.<br /><br />This isn't terrible &#150; but it only just misses that award.  The story is
simple, flunker George gets to run a police station and, in his own
streetwise way, makes it work.  He also takes on gangs etc in silly shoot
outs and action scenes.  The main problem is that the director doesn't know
what he's making.  We have Geroge talking direct to camera, we have
slapstick humour, we have silly sound effects, we have a love story, we have
action scenes and we have revenge stroylines.  The whole thing comes over as
more of a mess that a film.<br /><br />That's not to say it's totally unenjoyable.  Some of George's `to the
camera' bits are funny.  Some of the action scenes are good if a little to
like the A-Team etc.  But mixed together you never get settled on one style.
 It's not funny enough to be a comedy nor serious enough to be a
drama/thriller nor does the romantic subplot work at all.  With all the
mixed up pieces failing it can only create one thing &#150; a
failure.<br /><br />Slater tries hard and is OK despite having to deliver jokes to the audience
one minute, then be a dark revenge driven killer the next.  Jovovich is
underused but OK.  Goldwyn is left to do all the mugging and physical
`comedy' &#150; in other words&#133;.a thankless task.  The only performances of
interest come from spotting pre-fame Ashley Judd and Alexandra Paul
(Baywatch!).<br /><br />Overall it has some moments that are entertaining despite being dumb. 
However overall it's a mess of styles &#150; none of which work.
