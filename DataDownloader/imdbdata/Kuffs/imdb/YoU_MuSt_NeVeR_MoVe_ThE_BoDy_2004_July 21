I was looking around a local video store one day, looking for a good
movie to watch. They had a sale of older movies so I looked around. As
I was just about to give up all hope that I wouldn't find any good
movies in this &quot;collection&quot;, I found &quot;Kuffs&quot;. I thought, &quot;Christian
Slater...one of the coolest and hottest actors of the 90's. I haven't
seen this movie before.&quot; But I decided to leave without it. I recently
asked if it was worth buying and all of the people said yes (thank you)
so I went back out and bought it. I watched it and after laughing
throughout the whole movie I was pleased. Christian was hot (as usual)
and extremely funny. Although there isn't a lot of great action
sequences, there are hilarious one-liners. I suggest this movie to any
Slater fan and, well, everyone else, just for a good laugh.<br /><br />I give it a 8.5 out of 10
