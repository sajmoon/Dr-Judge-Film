1999_May 25 

Okay, so this movie is so totally dopey, it's sad.  But it remains one of
my
all time guilty pleasures.  I mean, c'mon: it's slick, it's fast, it's
fun,
it's the movie equivalent of a McDonald's Extra Value Meal.  Milla,
tape-over-mouth subtitles, Christian Slater talking to the camera in
&quot;Heathers&quot;-meets-Ferris Bueller mode.  Tony Goldwyn doped up.  Whacky
stunts
with run-over turkeys.  &quot;The Future's So Bright, I Gotta Wear Shades&quot;.
What
more could you ask for?  Well, a lot, probably.  But for good junk-food
movies, you can't ask for a more fast-paced, furiously funny, deliriously
dim-witted (and yet somehow slyly, raucuously self-aware) flick than
&quot;Kuffs&quot;.
