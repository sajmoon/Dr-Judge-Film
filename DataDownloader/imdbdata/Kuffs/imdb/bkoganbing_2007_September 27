If the rather quirky and unique screen personality of Christian Slater
is not your cup of tea, than I&#39;d stay away from Kuffs. Reading the film
credits before writing this review I learned that Kuffs was written
specifically for Slater. I can&#39;t see anyone else this role of George
Kuffs, amiable high school dropout who can&#39;t get his life together and
is sponging off his big brother Bruce Boxleitner.<br /><br />Boxleitner is a patrol specialist, an institution dating from the days
of the Forty Niners and unique unto San Francisco. There were not
enough police to enforce any semblance of law and order in a town that
just mushroomed over night. The city fathers assigned specific areas to
people to enforce law and order and Boxleitner has one of those
districts.<br /><br />But in his area, the merchants are being harassed and extorted and he&#39;s
being offered a huge bribe to sell his district to some really nasty
people. When he doesn&#39;t Boxleitner is killed and Christian Slater
inherits his job. <br /><br />Despite some really gaping holes in the plot, the film is really
carried along quite nicely by Christian Slater. Others in the cast of
note are Milla Jovavich as his pregnant girlfriend, Leon Rippy as the
hood who murdered Boxleitner and Tony Goldwyn as the SFPD officer
assigned to Slater to keep him from getting killed.<br /><br />Still Kuffs is strictly a Christian Slater show and his fans will
absolutely love it.
