George Kuffs (Christian Slater) has no job (or ambition), just got his
girlfriend Maya (Milla Jovovich) pregnant and lives off the kindness of
his big brother Brad (Bruce Boxleitner) a policeman. Brad is shot dead
in the line of duty and George inherits his brother&#x27;s district to
protect...but nobody trusts him and he doesn&#x27;t know if he can do the
job himself.<br /><br />Very odd film. The dramatic back story is predictable and pretty lame.
It&#x27;s full of totally unnecessary bloody shoot outs, car chases and tons
of gun play. Only the acting keeps that afloat (especially from
Boxleitner who is killed off far too early). However, among the dreary
dramatics, Slater breaks down the fourth wall and talks directly to the
audience. It&#x27;s tricky to pull that off but it works here. Also there
are bursts of really odd (but funny) comic bits. LOVE the bit where
Slater is trying to talk while his mouth is taped shut--and the film
provides subtitles so the audience can understand him! Also the acting
is good across the board. This movie was written with Slater in mind
and he really gets into it. He&#x27;s clearly having fun. Tony Goldwyn and
Jovovich are also good in their small roles. This is a strange but
engaging film. It was an automatic bomb at the box office because
there&#x27;s no way to really sell a movie like this. Worth catching.
