I LOVE Christian Slater! He's an excellent actor, and this movie proves
it!
He plays George Kuffs, a bum-like type guy who is more interested in
working
to get a loan, rather than working to get money. It's a long story, but
basically, his policeman brother gets killed, leaves George his job, and
now
George has to sell the place where his brother worked, or take over it.
Whether you're a Christian Slater fan or not, this movie is hilarious and
an
absolute MUST-SEE!!
