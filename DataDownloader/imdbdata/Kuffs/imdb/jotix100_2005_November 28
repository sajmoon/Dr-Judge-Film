Never saw this movie during its commercial run, but we caught with it
on cable recently. &quot;Kuffs&quot;, directed by Bruce Evans, was a surprise we
didn't expect. In fact, it appears not too many people saw it. The
movie is a mixture of action and comedy, which might not sit well with
a lot of people, but in fact, it holds our attention.<br /><br />Something the film shows didn't make sense to us. It seems that in San
Francisco certain precincts charge ordinary citizens for its
protection, something one has never heard of. In fact, at the center of
the film, is how one criminal makes an offer to the young Kuffs, who
has inherited the job from his slain brother. That is the only thing we
didn't quite get.<br /><br />In the film, George Kuffs talks directly to the camera, taking the
viewer into his confidence, which at the beginning feels strange, but
after one gets over that, the film moves smoothly and one can see what
the director intended. In the theater these moments are asides, and in
the film it serves as George's way to explain what's going on in his
mind.<br /><br />Christian Slater made a good contribution to the film, although it
appears he never liked the finished product. Milla Jovovich plays
Milla, but she is only seen at the beginning, middle and at the end of
the film, which is strange, but that's the way her part was written.
Also in the cast, Tony Goldwyn who has some excellent moments and
George de la Pena who plays the heavy Sam Jones.<br /><br />&quot;Kuffs&quot; is more rewarding than other films of this genre.
