2008_November 30 
My roommate in college dragged me to this piece of crap, and I&#39;m
ashamed to say I actually paid top dollar (maybe $6 in 1992) to see it.
It&#39;s the first movie I ever walked out on. Or it would have been if my
roommate wasn&#39;t such a big Christian Slater fan. That and the fact that
he had the car. When the IMDb top 250 and it&#39;s ugly step-sister, the
Bottom 100 first came out a few years ago, this movie was in the
latter. It was right up there (or down there, more appropriately) in
the top 10 with Manos, The Hands of Fate (which really wasn&#39;t that bad
if viewed via Mystery Science Theater 3000). This truly was a horrible
film. In a year that also produced Reservoir Dogs, Army of Darkness, A
Few Good Men and the Unforgiving, this movie should be &quot;The Forgotten&quot;
and for good reason. It stuck.
