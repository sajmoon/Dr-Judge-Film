I believe this is one of the best of Christian Slater's flicks. Great
soundtrack, good action, very funny... . <br /><br />The action is very exciting and the characters are well-built and
interesting. The classic confrontation of teenagers and
responsibilities was never better portrayed than it is in this movie,
and it is also well connected to all the other events of the storyline.
I watched it for the first time when I was fourteen and it still
strikes me the same way every time I watch it again. This is the kind
of movie that is not made to be a classic, but fulfills its most basic
goal: entertain. Two thumbs up !!<br /><br />I also think that Milla and Christian made a nice couple. They should
act together again someday...
