No clue why people bash on this so much, it's a early 90s cop comedy with
Christian Slater and Milla Jovovich, Slater plays George Kuffs a slacker
who
becomes a cop to avenge the death of his brother.<br /><br />Movie has some good one liners and the best part is how Slater talks to
the
camera throughout the movie to let us know what he's thinking.<br /><br />Great timefiller.
