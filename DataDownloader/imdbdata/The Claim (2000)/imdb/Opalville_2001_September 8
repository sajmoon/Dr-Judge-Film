2001_September 8 

This film magically transported me and my significant other to 1862 and
evoked many fond memories of my youth growing up in suburban Calcutta.
Everyone loves a parade, and no one more so than yours truly.  This movie
invites the audience to re-experience the gold rush of the bucolic west,
and
pictorially gave me goose bumps!  I hadn't experienced this much
psychodrama
since McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller.  The Claim inspired me to sojourn westward
myself, and I am now the proud owner of a prime chunk of Nevada desert,
where I hope to open a house of ill-repute and a soda shop.  Thank you for
this movie!
