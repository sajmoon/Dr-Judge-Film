One thing I loved about this film is also the thing that took it down a
notch:  The place looked so real.  It did not seem like a movie set.  It did
not even seem like a movie, with actors saying their lines.  It was more
like you were eavesdropping on a town.  One way they showed this was
overlapping dialogue.  There would be several different conversations at
once.  You'd catch the tail end of one, the main thrust of another, and the
beginning of yet another conversation.  All this contributed to make it one
of the most realistic movies I've ever seen.<br /><br />The disadvantage in this is that I think the director spent too much camera
time on incidental dialogue, and not enough on dialogue involving the main
plot.  Some incredibly emotional scenes were cut short.  Just when you think
you're going to get hit with it, it moves to a scene where Milla is talking
to Bentley about something trivial.  And those shots lasted far too long. I
understand that in movie making, you don't want to focus on the sentimental,
because if you do, it can come out maudlin and manipulative.  But in this
case, I felt a little cheated.<br /><br />Still...I was deeply moved by several scenes in the movie.  So it wasn't
devoid of all emotion.  I just felt in places it could have been
stronger.<br /><br />Nastassja Kinski was perfect for her role, and I don't say that about her
very often.  She looked every bit like she could have an 18 year old
daughter, and yet she was also incredibly childlike and delicate herself. 
And beautiful, in a pale, pathetic, used way. Actually, the best term to
describe her in this movie is &quot;haunting.&quot;  <br /><br />Peter Mullan was awesome.  I have never seen him in anything, but I was
fascinated.  Milla was like an over-ripe exotic bird.  She was excellent at
nailing greedy desperation.  As for the subplot with Wes Bentley and Sarah
Polley, I was not terribly moved by it.  These two were not bad, but not
outstanding in any way, either.<br /><br />Scenery was fantastic. 
You know how some movies stick with you for awhile?  This is one of
those.<br /><br />
