for freedom and democracy against British monarchical tyranny.  This story
is  reinforced again and again on the big screen. The story of The West is
one that is used most often to illuminate the fight for these essentially
admirable ideals.   The small American story however, the one often hidden
from historical view,  is the one that injects a little reality into this
interpretation of the American way of freedom and democracy by revealing
what really inspired  the revolution and made America the country it is.
In
cinematic terms, The Claim is one of those small stories that expresses
much
about the American economic mentality.
`Everything has a price' says the film publicity. That tagline defines not
only the action of this story but a whole social context, where the
driving
force behind the society, the main preoccupation of its citizens, is
self-interest, and society itself morally bankrupt.
Of course, the story could be set anywhere, its inspiration is credited
to
Thomas Hardy's Mayor of Casterbridge set in the small, rural backwaters of
19th century England. However, excessive materialism in  this setting is
not
to be equated with  the general nature of society. The story of a man
selling his wife and daughter to finance his own ambitions is such an
outrage because it is related to a society with some moral credibility.
But  in the 1840s California, in an era of frenzied  gold prospecting
where
`everything has a price' and economic success is everything, the moral
effect of such a story is of a different nature. This is the setting for
The
Claim.
So,  it is not surprising that The Claim is an essentially English
enterprise. Setting the Hardy story  amidst the relatively uncivilised
landscape of the Sierra Nevada, in a thin society set up by invading
hoards
of the self interested, ruthless and ambitious representatives of
unfettered
capitalism, Michael Winterbottom, the film's young English director, and
writer Frank Boyce have, with a measure of cynicism,  advanced a new moral
context for the original story.
Twenty years after the mad rush for gold Daniel Dillon ( Peter Mullen)  is
king of Kingdom Come, a town built on gold. Dillon owns everything of
value,
the bank, the mine, the hotel, the liquor store and his affectionate
association with the exotic brothel owner Lucia (Milla Jovovich)  affirms
his control of every aspect of town life.  However, his success was
financed
and made possible only by an apparent act of moral depravity many years
before.
The arrival of three strangers disturbs his contentment and threatens his
success. Two women, the young and beautiful Hope (Sarah Polley) and the
ailing Elena (Natassja Kinski) possess the secret of his potential
downfall.
The other stranger, Mr Dalglish (Wes Bentley), a railway surveyor,
represents a purely economic danger to Kingdom Come.
Yet, this `moral' tale has, ultimately, limited effect because here is a
society where depravity is the norm. So, the film's weakness is based on
an
irony.  The more accurate  it is at depicting a morally uncharted land, a
wilderness of brutality where a civilised social contract is barely
recognisable - and here the film is excellent - , the less an immoral act
is
reprehensible. .<br /><br />
