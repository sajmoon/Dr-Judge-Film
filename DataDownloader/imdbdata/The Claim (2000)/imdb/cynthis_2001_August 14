If you have read &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; by Thomas Hardy, then you
don't
need to watch this movie.  The entire plot is very similar to that play;
the
only difference is that the character names are different and the location
is different.  Other than that, the whole storyline is the same.  So if you
want to watch a movie with a rip-offed story, then watch this!
