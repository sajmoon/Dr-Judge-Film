2001_April 28 

You can not escape the very close parallels between this rather tedious,
PBS/BBC like (earnest,artsy,pretentious) film and the brilliant and
evocative Robert Altman masterpiece, McCabe and Mrs. Miller. Where Altman's
central characters are the co-founders of a profitable, freewheeling
frontier town until big business (railroad then, Walmart now) blows into
town lured by the smell of money. Altman's warmly sympathetic portrait of
the title characters who are loners isolated from each other as well as the
community they founded together is in stark contrast to the melodramatic,
paper thin characters Michael Winterbottom props up like stick figures in a
picturesque landscape. In McCabe and Mrs. Miller, the town pulls together
to
form a community as they fight a church fire. In The Claim, the townspeople
scramble for gold in the ashes of the town they deserted for economic
reasons. Altman's view of the railroad suggests the ruthlessness of
corporate enterprise. Winterbottom straddles the fence, celebrating the
railroad and endorsing the naive technological boosterism that one of
America's worst attributes, while condescending to the townspeople who are
depicted as avaricious in the film's climactic scenes(the murderous
railroad
engineer is the love interest and hero of this capitalistic epic). Altman
evokes a lost era with sympathy, while Winterbottom wallows in cheap irony,
shamelessly borrowing from Altman while defiling a great film's memory.
This
movie would be perfect PBS fodder, as it lacks any spark of originality
while it clings to its &quot;serious art&quot; pedigree (based on a novel by Thomas
Hardy) for dear life. If you want to see a great &quot;Northwestern&quot; try Anthony
Mann's The Far Country, which would pair wonderfully with McCabe and Mrs.
Miller in a double bill. Don't waste more than two hours with this
pointless, meandering pastiche of Thomas Hardy by way of Robert Altman. Go
and enjoy the originals instead.
