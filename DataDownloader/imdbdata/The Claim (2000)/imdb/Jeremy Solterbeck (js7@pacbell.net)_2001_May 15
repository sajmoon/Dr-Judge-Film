In the sense that it lacks the conventions of any particular trend or
mode,
The Claim is timeless filmmaking.  It betrays no resemblance to any single
period in film's modern history, and could've as easily appeared in 1985,
or
1965, as now.  Of all the cinematic influences Director Winterbottom might
ally, he seems to have ignored all but one: himself.  Leaving behind
contemporary notions of style or authorism, he guides us through the story
of a pioneer man's creation of himself, his young aspirations, and the
insurmountable grief he eventually reaps.  Winterbottom's camera moves
softly and beautifully, even in and out of focus, as if navigating slowly
through falling snow or sluggish cold air.  But the film, for all it's
seemingly languorous pace, never once leaves us for wont of a scene to
move
on, or for the story to ascend another level of fullness.  The story will
chill your heart as deeply as it's landscape will chill your
bones.
