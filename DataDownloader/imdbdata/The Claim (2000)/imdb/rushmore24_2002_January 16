2002_January 16 

I've waited a long time for its release here and have to express my
disappointment at the final result. Hardy's work has long been a rich source
for many British television dramatizations and a few successful films like
'Tess' and 'Jude'. Given the setting the film should have looked spectacular
and yet colour, clarity and/or composition spoil beautiful images that
Ridley Scott or Terrence Malick would not have wasted. The story of betrayal
and shame is interesting but it is exposed by too many awkwardly staged
scenes, often with banal dialogue. No role is given enough flesh by the
screenwriter and much of the acting talent is wasted, particularly Wes
Bentley after his electric performance in 'American Beauty'. There are too
many snowbound vistas and insufficient character exposition. Like 'McCabe
and Mrs Miller' the deprivation and conditions of a frontier town are not
hidden, yet the only thing to thaw the ice and snow is the climactic fire
rather than any real emotional warmth from the characters. However Nyman's
music does do justice to the mountainous panoramas.
