The two most known actrices from East-Europe, Nastassja Kinski and Milla
Jovohovic are united in here and strangly enough the theme is as American as
American can be.
Director Michael Winterbottom tells the story of a certain Dillon (played by
Peter Mullan who is most known of his typical Irish productions from Ken
Loach) is one of the pioneers who starts setting up a new town (Kingdom
Come) in the unexplored America in where there's still a market for people
who do everything illegal (he owns a brothel at where his wife Jovohovic
takes notice if all the money comes to the origin. Years ago he had a
relationship with mrs. Kinski and as his heart was where the wallet fits he
then sold his daughter, but when a sick and dying Kinski comes to visit him
again Dillon's empire literarily burns.
It's an okay movie with some spectacular scenes but it's bit too dull filmed
and Mullan, a superb actor, seems a bit misplaced in here and even the
beauty of both Kinski and Jovohovic can't rescue the movie. Not bad but not
good either.
