2001_February 6 

My fave film of 2001 yet. In another week I may not have gone to see this,
so I'm glad there were no other releases that appealed to me, because I
wouldn't want to have missed this - I enjoyed it more than I was expecting
to. Yes, it is reminiscent of 'Heaven's Gate', but this is probably better,
if only for the fact that you won't have to devote half a day to see it. It
has its flaws certainly - for instance, Wes Bentley's character doesn't
really convince - but its positives far outweigh those: it looks great, the
performances are excellent, and it's moving without being sentimental.
Although her character was maybe just a little too sweet and humble for me
(but that's not really her fault) Sarah Polley steals the show. Peter
Mullan
was class too, but (again, not the actor's fault) I did find it hard to
reconcile how old he looked given the timescale and his character as
depicted in flashback - though I guess the hard life of a prospector in
1860's America would have taken it's toll. This movie does give you a feel
for how life would have been at that time and place, and for the importance
the railways played in the country's development. The moral of the story is
the old one about selling your soul for filthy lucre, you have to live with
your sins and your mistakes, and you can't put a price on love. I rarely
pay
to go see a movie twice, but I might just make an exception for this one.
Don't miss.
