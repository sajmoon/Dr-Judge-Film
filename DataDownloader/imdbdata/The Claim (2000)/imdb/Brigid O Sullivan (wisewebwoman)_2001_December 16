T saw this movie on the recommendation of a friend.  I thoroughly enjoyed it
though the plot is &quot;the Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; with some twists.  I gave it
a 7 out of 10 for the absorption factor.  I found Mullan's performance
haunting, the only flaw was Bentley who seemed totally miscast and at sea. 
Between smirking and bedding a variety of prostitutes he seems oddly
detached from everything, even his job as an engineer.  A highly embarassing
performance which impacted on the young Sarah Polley, his love interest. 
Her devotion to him seems misplaced.  Kinski is superb as the mother and i
found the scene of the house being towed surreal and as gripping as the
church floating on the river in &quot;Oscar and Lucinda&quot;. I found I was not
beaten over the head with the 2X4s of what passes for plot in a lot of
movies these days.  There was sublety, a real feel for the era with the
railroad coming through.  Even the bawdy house had an atmosphere all its
own.  Hats off to the director and cinematographer.
