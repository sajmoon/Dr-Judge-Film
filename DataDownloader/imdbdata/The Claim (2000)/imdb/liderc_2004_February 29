An interesting &quot;modern&quot; western that wants to emulate the American western
movies and is heavily spoiled by its annoying voyeuristic sex scenes and its
tendency to show people only interested in sex and/or dirty talk. Milla
Jovovich and the character she portrays are rather annoying (the whore with
the oh so golden heart). Kinski and the other actors are good to excellent.
The directing is interesting at times, but sometimes I wondered whether the
director wanted his movie to look like a romantic MTV pop video, take the
scene with the burning horse for example. The score is a nice work and
typical for its composer I think. I guess the director didn't know which way
his movie should go. Btw, the German title is great.
