Disappointing effort based upon interesting storyline.  Forlorn expressions
don't take the place of a good script.  Who did the editing-- found the
pacing to be odd- certain scenes should have had more time to play out,
others were rushed.  Get rid of the flashbacks- let us discover the
connection and reach our own conclusion as to the circumstances that led to
the trade of the wife and infant.
