This film needs a laugh or two in the script.  It comes across as if a film
student with a lot of Daddy's money made it.  &quot;Hey, I have this great idea
for a Western&quot; And he happens to be friends with a lot of
actors.<br /><br />First off, what is it with films today using Nastassja Kinski as the
sickly/abused mother?  Stop it!<br /><br />The film has it's imagery and cinematography going for it.  However, the
film uses all these handsome women and men who drift about scene to scene
without any motivation.  I am never quite sure as to what is going on nor do
I care after 30 minutes in to the viewing.<br /><br />There is no one to identify with. Perhaps the point of the film was to show
shows how nobody seems to really care about anybody in the old
west.<br /><br />But, hey, if the director got to make his dream film then all the power to
him. I look forward to making mine.  I would like to use the same actors if
I could get so lucky.
