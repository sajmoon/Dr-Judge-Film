Saw at a screening at Cannes- and as trite as &quot;Oscar-worthy&quot; may sound, this
film is IT.  A sweeping, magestic epic which astounds the soul as well as
the mind, one wonders how it could be looked over when it comes around to
Oscar-time.  Wes Bentley is awesome in his second-round role after American
Beauty, Milla Jovovich finally silences those who may have questioned her
acting ability in The Messenger, and Sarah Polley gives a real, blistering,
reminds-me-of-Emma-Thomson-esc truthful performance.  Natasha Kinski is
heart-wrenching.  Go see this movie.
