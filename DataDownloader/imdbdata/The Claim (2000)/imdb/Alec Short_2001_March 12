I was looking forward to seeing this film. The Mayor of Casterbridge upon
which this film is based is one of my favorite books, I like Westerns,
mountains and snow. So why did I have trouble staying awake?
The acting is okay, but the characters are under developed, and the
screenplay gives them very little scope to involve the audience. It's a
shame because this could have been a great movie if handled
properly.
The music is good, and the sets are also excellent. The last ten minutes
are
quite good but overall I find it left me as cold as the town it was set
in.
