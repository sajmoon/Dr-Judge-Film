It's been quite some time since I last saw a breathtaking epic story (e.g.
Braveheart). I really think that Mr. Winterbottom (the director) did a
very
careful and good job in making this movie. For one thing, while watching
the
movie, you can really understand how each of the character feels. For
instance, you know how painful Mr. Dillion's struggle was once he saw his
own wife and daughter again(whom he had once sold, just for the sake of
getting some gold). The way how he was torn from his past doing and his
not-really-effective compensation that he wanted to pay for both of them.
Or, you can know how Hope, the daughter, who, aside from wanting to be a
very good daughter, also thought about love. dream and hope of her own
life.
Or, how the mother, despite all the difficult times that she had gone
through because of her husband's deeds, she still loved him enough to
forgive and accept. And last of all, you could see what kind of person
Dalglish, and also the people in Kingdom Come were like.<br /><br />I personally think that one of the best part in the movie was the 'fire'
part. And actually Lucia's role was good too. I think Milla Jovovich
(Lucia)
sang very beautifully in the movie. And that Sarah Polle (Hope) did a neat
job as the obeying daughter as well.<br /><br />One thing I also want to say about this movie is that, the cinematography
is
great. And you can really get a glimpse of how the people's life during
the
Gold Rush was like.<br /><br />I personally think that this movie is more than just a romance story, and
I
am sure that everyone can at least get something out of watching
it.
