2006_September 6 
This movie has two main and huge problems: First, the plot is TERRIBLE.
I thought there would be some psychological drama going on, but no and
nothing. From the beginning to the end it&#39;s just dull dull dull,
nothing going on, no good storyline, there were plenty of things I just
did not understand at all, it was all confusing. I mean, the original
idea was good, but that&#39;s about it. Second: it seems the director
didn&#39;t think about how the scene looks like at all. Everything was new,
it was obvious it had never been used before. People had new clothes
on, even those working on the railroad, new tents (very clean, newly
bought, newly built, not a drop of snow fell on them, although it seems
to be snowing none stop.), some people have sunglasses (that could be
my mistake, but were sunglasses common in the Sierra Nevada in 1887?),
and nothing was realistic.<br /><br />The first twenty minutes I tried to watch the movie, then I had fun
commenting it with my sister, but the second half, I was looking on the
internet about it, see if some people liked it, because I couldn&#39;t
really watch it anymore.<br /><br />Why do people shoot such movies? DON&#39;T DO THAT ANYMORE! Please.
