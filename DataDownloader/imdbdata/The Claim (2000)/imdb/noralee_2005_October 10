I was sold on seeing &quot;The Claim&quot; from the preview of a hunky bearded
Wes Bentley looking longingly at one of my favorite Canadian actresses,
Anne of Green Gables herself, Sarah Polley.<br /><br />It's been decades since I read &quot;Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; or years since I
saw a &quot;Masterpiece Theater&quot; version so I can't remember how closely
this is inspired by Thomas Hardy (the women certainly seem pluckier)
but it's far more &quot;McCabe and Mrs. Miller&quot; than Yorkshire.<br /><br />The snowy Canadian and Colorado Rockies landscape is breathtaking and
the Michael Nyman score rises to the peaks.<br /><br />The melange of French, Polish, Irish, Scotch etc. accents are suitable
for the uncivilized West of lonely gold miners, pioneers,
fortune-hunters and adventurers on the cusp of the railroad changing
the country forever.<br /><br />The Ozymandias references are a bit thick; perhaps Brit Michael
Winterbottom doesn't realize that we're all familiar with the Western
movie convention of the town controlled by one king (usually played
recently by Gene Hackman), though unusually here Peter Mullan is not
evil but sympathetically complex (strong and vulnerable, sexy and
paternal), as he comes to grips with his past, while the rest of the
town is coming to grips with its future.<br /><br />Bentley too is no stiff hero, but a regular guy on a mission of
progress thrown into a series of temporary situations that become
permanent.<br /><br />It's unusual that a costume drama set in the 1900's can seem so
naturalistic.<br /><br />(originally written 5/5/2001)
