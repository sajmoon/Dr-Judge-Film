One of the most remarkable adaptations of a literary work I've seen.
Frank Cottrell Boyce completely changes Thomas Hardy's classic The
Mayor of Casterbridge - and actually betters it lifting it from its
original setting and tailoring it into a tale of the American West
during the Gold Rush. Some of Hardy's holes hold (predictable)
difficulty for many modern readers, but Boyce's western retelling fills
them in and lends strong plausibility. (There's a tad too much &quot;faint,
fall ill and die&quot; for me in the Hardy original). Some have complained
that Boyce went too far - but this is a movie &quot;based&quot; on the book not
claiming to be a faithful retelling.<br /><br />Director Michael Winterbottom proves to have an enormous eye emerging
in bold style at once stylized and natural. He brings us here images
that, once seen, burn, linger and haunt forever be it a Victorian
mansion hauled across the frozen plains or a horse's immolation as on
fire it gallops across the screen. <br /><br />Winterbottom's cast is a strong one - none remaining as they initially
seem, each changing before our eyes. Kinski, first strong and bitter
gives one of her most tender heartbreaking performances, Wes Bentley,
likable and promising becomes petty and meddlesome. Milla Jovovich
serves up, predictably, hearty and hot, yet more delicate than she
would like to appear. <br /><br />In all of this Peter Mullan's Daniel Dillon is the focus and the
fulcrum by which the story hinges. He is never less than masterful. To
see him early on nearly ravaged by youthful greed then watch him in age
yearn for salvation that may never come or come too late, one cannot
help but be riveted by his endeavor to make up by his plight and his
attempt to change it.<br /><br />The Claim is a remarkable film which, while it may take a bit of time
to warm up to, burns its own unique reward in a way few modern
Hollywood films can.
