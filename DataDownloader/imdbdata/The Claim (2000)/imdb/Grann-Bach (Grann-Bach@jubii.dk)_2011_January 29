Set in California in the 1860&#x27;s. When Dalglish(Bentley) comes to the
small town of Kingdom Come to bring a railroad to it, Dillon(Mullan)
must confront the terrible secret of his past, of what happened twenty
years prior. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this, and the front of
the cover certainly didn&#x27;t give much of a clue. Honestly, I got it(on
sale) because of my seemingly never-ending crush on Milla Jovovich(I
can see worlds beyond in her eyes... and for anyone else who might
watch this for her, she&#x27;s in it a pretty reasonable amount, and she is
gorgeous, charming, and sometimes pouty and raunchy in it), and as
usual, she does a great job acting(everyone in this does) and is a
sight to behold. This is the only version of this story that I&#x27;ve seen,
so I can&#x27;t compare it to any other. I haven&#x27;t caught anything else by
this director, either. This moves at a gradual pace. It&#x27;s an epic
drama(complete with breathtaking scenery) set in the same time, but it
is not a Western. The accents come and go. This shows how relationships
and gender roles were back then. There is a bit of strong language,
female nudity and sexuality in this. The DVD comes with the original
theatrical trailer. I recommend this to fans of the cast and/or this
genre. 7/10
