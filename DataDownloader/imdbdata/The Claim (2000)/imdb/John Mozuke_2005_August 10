This movie was just plain boring. It leaves you thinking &quot;what the heck
is going on here and when is something worth making a movie for going
to happen.&quot; I got sucked in because it stars Milla Jovovich and I adore
her but this movie just stinks. It is boring, boring, BORING. She looks
great as usual and does a good job with what she is given. Her
character is one of the only ones that is remotely interesting as she
plays a whore with a heart of gold ( and tooth to match) type
character. But it just went on and on and it went... no where. I saw
potential and thought this movie could have been good but it was like
the director and writer just got in a car and took it no where.
