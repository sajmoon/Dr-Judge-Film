Other than the beautiful soundtrack, there's not much here that is
memorable. Most of the cast looks out of place and uncomfortable in their
roles ( see Milla sing, see Milla act - not ). It's like a puzzle with too
many pieces improperly placed. Not plot driven, with only free floating
situations with a couple of fragmented flashbacks, which only give away too
much too soon.  Coupled with a gratuitous sex scene here and there, it all
makes for an anti-climatic, predictable ending. I would of liked to see more
of Peter Mullan's character fleshed out a bit more instead of the incessant
close-ups of Sarah Polley and Wes Bentley. It's like &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot; meets
&quot;Jeremiah Johnson&quot;.
