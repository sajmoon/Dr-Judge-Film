Peter Mullen was unintelligible - I couldn't understand a word he said - the
editing was pretty byzantine. The movie had promise in terms of its' feel-
like McCabe and Mrs. Miller - remote winter in the goldrush mountains but
M&amp;MM was better. The singing was great! It sounded like Fado music from
Portugal. The singer was listed as a model- was the voice dubbed; If not I'd
buy her CD.
