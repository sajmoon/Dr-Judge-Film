I have been following this director for a while and I always liked his films
but this time he has exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />'The Claim' is like an ancient greek tragedy and Dillon is its'
hero.
Dillon is a man who goes West with his wife and new born daughter in order
to find gold.  In the process he sells his wife and his daughter in exchange
for that gold.  
Years later his wife will come back to haunt him and Dillon comes to realize
how empty his life has been, how irrelevant wealth can be to happiness.  The
story is so beautifully told and the last scene where the people of the new
city of Lisboa prey on Dillon's gold is a metaphor or at least I would like
it to be. I think Winterbottom wanted to show how the world will never
change, how people will continue to go after that gold.  Dillon came and
went, but he didn't leave anything behind him.  He achieved all those
things, he was a pioneer he went out West, he was one of the people who
built America but he didn't win his daughter's heart.  And it makes one
wonder, what was the point of his life.
'The Claim' is the story of America itself, an America that was built on
greed, on the quest for new lands, new conquers and prosperity.
Peter Mullan gives us an excellent performance, as well as Sarah Polley as
the elegant young daughter and Milla Jovovich. Nastasia Kinsky has a rather
insignificant role and Wes Bentley is disappointing.
Overall, a very good film, a piece of art by Winterbottom and a story that
you won't forget for a while.
