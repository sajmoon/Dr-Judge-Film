Peter Mullan is good in most things that he's involved with. I'm definitely
a fan, he's a damn good actor. Plus I enjoy Kinski and Thomas Hardy
storylines and the slant on this was interesting. Beautiful scenery and some
fine camera work. But overall this was a clunker. The actress &quot;Sarah Polley&quot;
was just simply awful. She spoilt it so much for and irritated me that I
wanted to turn it off. Why do actors/actresses get parts based soley on
their good looks. Perhaps she is good in something else, but this movie
really did hang very much on liking this young lady and she lost a good
opportunity with this part. Pity. I'd like to see this novel made again but
this time, base it back in Wessex where it belongs. Nice try.
