A good stab at transferring Hardy's &quot;Mayor of Casterbridge&quot;. Mullan is
once
again excellent. The sub-plot with Bentley serves the film well. It's
well-written, well-acted and awesome to look at.<br /><br />One of those films that you need to see at the cinema. Winterbottom
continues to prove himself one of the foremost contemporary
directors.
