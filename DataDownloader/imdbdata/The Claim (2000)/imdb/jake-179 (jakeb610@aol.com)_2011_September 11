What a total waste. This movie should have been good. It had great
actors, great scenics, great cinematography, and no story. Perhaps the
story was there, as it was an adaptation of a novel, but the director
TOTALLY failed to tell whatever story there was to be had. The director
did a great job of finding shots, and making the viewer feel as though
he was experiencing a developing mining town in the 1800&#x27;s, but there
was just no cohesion of story telling. The pace of the movie was so
slow, it was impossible to follow. One scene sets up, and you think as
the viewer that you are going to being to get a feeling of what the
movie is about, and then it just trails off and another scene begins. I
thought it was especially stupid when the band of guys with guns
confronts the band of rail road guys. Everybody pulls out their guns,
the rail road guy shoots on of the town guys, and then all the town
guys just turn around and walk away like nothing happened. The
direction was so soft, so subdued, so poker-faced, that the movie never
picks up any momentum and consequently fails in telling any real story.
This is a failure of the director. This movie should be avoided. If you
are looking for a good western about gold miners confronting greedy
town folk, then you should watch PALE RIDER with Clint Eastwood. THE
CLAIM was boring and pointless. The only reason I rated it a 2 instead
of a 1 is because I thought it was shot well. <br /><br />One last point I want to make is the Wes Bently looked pretty much
exactly the same in this as he did in American BEAUTY, sporting the
same stupid snow cap. That kind of snow cap is a modern one, with an
ELASTIC HEAD BAND, that did not exist in the 1800&#x27;s. Again, a total
failure on the part of the idiot that directed this disaster.
