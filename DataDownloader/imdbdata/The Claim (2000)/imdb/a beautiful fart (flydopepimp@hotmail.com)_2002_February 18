2002_February 18 

having only seen &quot;welcome to sarajevo&quot;, and &quot;i want you&quot;, i'm not too
familiar with winterbottom's work, but this film was interesting due to
the
cast and subject matter. any film with sarah polley *swoon* and peter
mullan, gets my attention straight away. wes bentley and his beard gave
convincing performances as well. the film i thought just tended to drag a
bit, and the dialogue didnt seem to have much flow. but the cinematography
and sarah polley close-ups made up for that perfectly.<br /><br />6&frac12;/10
