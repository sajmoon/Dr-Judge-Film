The Claim is a story of family tragedy and the inevitability of fate set
in
1867 California. It is apparently based on a novel by Thomas Hardy, but I
cannot attest to the faithfulness of this film to the novel except to say
that it undoubtedly had a change of setting.<br /><br />Daniel Dillon is  the ruler of Kingdom Come, a small mining town high in
the California Sierras. Dillon is rich, powerful but fair, and has won the
favor of a beautiful young mistress. But he has secrets that that makes
contentment elusive. Twenty years before, Dillon committed an unspeakable
act to gain his fortune and has been marking time ever
since.<br /><br />When two mysterious women, an older woman and her twenty-year old
daughter,
arrive in Kingdom Come with a railroad survey party, the sins of the past
come back to affect everyone in the town. Although I haven't read the
source
material, the plot and tone of this film has an almost palpable sense of
impending tragedy that is a hallmark in all of Hardy's works. The harsh
winter and forbidding mountains of the American west fits very well with
this theme.<br /><br />Although this is ostensibly a western, there are none of the standard
western cliches in this film. There are no heroes nor villains. The
sporadic
scenes of violence are confused and pointless, as violent situations are
apt
to be, and the pacing of the film is very deliberate. It is an intimate
epic, more concerned with character than grand vistas and set pieces.
Nevertheless, the visuals are stunning. I wish could have seen this on a
big
screen.<br /><br />Watching this film, I couldn't help thinking to myself how this is what it
must have been like, living in those times. Many critics have complained
how
muted the performances are, but in a time when death was so close and a
person's fortune was so transitory, not investing a lot of emotional stake
into something seems a pragmatic choice. Besides, without a modicum of
restraint, this film could have devolved into melodramatic camp. As far as
I
am concerned the choices were perfect.<br /><br />The standout cast includes Scottish actor Peter Mullan as Dillon. He is
the
center of this film. His performance brings both gravity and
vulnerabitlity
to this complex character.<br /><br />The always watchable Natassja Kinski plays Elena, the mysterious, dying
woman who has returned from Dillon's past. Sarah Polley plays Hope,
Elena's
innocent daughter who serves as a catalyst for Dillon's search for
redemption. Polley's character is sketchier than the others, serving more
as
a plot point, but Polley does what she can with this ultra virtuous
Victorian throwback.<br /><br />But the real casting surprise is  a nearly unrecognizable Milla Jovovich
in
the small but intergral role of Lucia, Dillon's mistress. Lucia is
Dillon's
opposite in every way: tough, smart and running from a regretful past.
It's
a tough role and Jovovich pulls is off beautifully. I had previously
dismissed her as a bimbo model dilletante, but this serious sympathetic
performance sheds a new light on things. Hopefully she will be given
similar
down to earth roles in the future.<br /><br />People compare this film to Robert Altman's 1970's anti-western, McCabe
and
Mrs. Miller. This might be accurate in a superficial way, but I found the
Claim much more satisfying. I found Winterbottom's objective, detached
storytelling more effective than Altman's gimmicky, painfully
self-conscious
direction. I was never a fan of that film (or Altman in general)  in the
first place, so almost anything would be an improvement.<br /><br />A better comparison would be Ang Lee's 1999 masterwork, Ride With the
Devil.
Both portray a little known facet of American history in an authentic and
unsentimental fashion. They take the settings of a Western without
wallowing
in convention. They were also both buried by the public. It's sad to think
that when garbage like Pearl Harbor are splattered all over multiplexes in
the country, a beautiful film like this is ignored. It does not reflect
well
on modern American culture.<br /><br />The Claim was definitely the best movie that was released in 2000 that I
have seen. And I feel confidant that it will be recognized as one of the
best films of this new decade.<br /><br />See it. Now.
