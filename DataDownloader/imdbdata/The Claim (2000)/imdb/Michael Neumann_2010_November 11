If William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays can be staged as Freudian science
fiction or medieval samurai dramas, and Jane Austen re-written as an
airhead Beverly Hills teen comedy, why can&#x27;t Thomas Hardy&#x27;s &#x27;The Mayor
of Casterbridge&#x27; be transplanted from rural Dorcetshire to a rough and
tumble California mining camp during the 1849 gold rush? After all, the
change of scenery in Michael Winterbottom&#x27;s screen adaptation (here
given the more marquee-friendly title &#x27;The Claim&#x27;) is only geographic,
putting a visually restless Western spin on an otherwise typically
mannered Old World allegory of guilt and retribution.<br /><br />The title character of Hardy&#x27;s novel is now a wealthy, influential
magnate in a Mother Lode boomtown likely to go bust unless the Central
Pacific can lay its proposed trans-continental railway within whistle
distance of the mines. His town is named (with undisguised
significance) Kingdom Come, and in true literary fashion its leading
citizen is hiding a terrible secret.<br /><br />Flashbacks (early enough in the film to not require a spoiler alert)
reveal the awful truth: as a starving young immigrant he coldly traded
his own wife and infant daughter for the lucrative grubstake that would
give him all his subsequent prosperity and power. Years later, his
dying wife and now grown daughter (the latter ignorant of her pedigree)
have returned to Kingdom Come, and their arrival by stagecoach,
together with the young engineer from the railroad survey team, is the
fateful curtain opener and catalyst for what follows.<br /><br />It sounds compelling, and on a purely cosmetic level the film is a
welcome relief from the usual medley of Hollywood sequels, spin-offs,
remakes and rip-offs now crowding the nearest multiplex. But somewhere
in translation from print to screen some of that dramatic potential was
lost, smothered under the too relentlessly grim and oppressive
presentation.<br /><br />One hundred and twenty minutes of overcast skies and drifting snows can
leave a bitter aftertaste with even the most stalwart viewer, although
it needs to be said that the near palpable winter chill is more or less
faithful to the spirit of the original novel. According to the Concise
Columbia Encyclopedia (a handy one-volume, all-purpose reference guide)
Hardy was known for writing &#x22;generally gloomy, naturalistic studies of
character and environment&#x22;, which is about as tidy a description of the
film as anyone could ask for.<br /><br />Paraphrased in less formal vernacular, the gist of it can be summed up
even more simply: &#x22;Life stinks &#x96; get used to it.&#x22; Winterbottom goes out
of his way to vividly depict the Old West in all its true, unromantic
squalor, creating a ramshackle plywood metropolis populated by a
rootless community of bickering whores, drunken miners, unlucky
gamblers, and other assorted vagabonds on the muddy road to El Dorado.
Even the more lavish boudoir of the local nabobs (&#x27;mayor&#x27; Peter Mullen
and his &#x27;Portuguese&#x27; mistress Milla Jovovich) is under lit to the same
shabby monochrome.<br /><br />Add some fashionably sloppy cinema verit&#xE8; camera-work and the result is
a handsome but frigid retro-70s downer, heavily in debt to Robert
Altman&#x27;s &#x27;McCabe and Mrs. Miller&#x27; but conspicuously lacking Altman&#x27;s
anti-Hollywood iconoclasm (not to mention Warren Beatty&#x27;s marquee value
charisma). Winterbottom certainly deserves a round of applause for at
least attempting to de-glamorize the traditional silver screen
whitewash of frontier life. But despite the rich texture of the period
detail he still can&#x27;t resist putting a halfway romantic halo around the
raw vulgarity of his setting. Maybe it&#x27;s an unavoidable side effect to
spinning a Western tall tale. Heck, even Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s &#x27;Wild Bunch&#x27;
had their moments of misty-eyed, sloppy macho sentimentality.<br /><br />You can see it here in the majestic alpine scenery, meant to be
California but shot (somewhat obviously, to this displaced Westerner)
in the more visually epic Canadian and Colorado Rockies. (A quick
historical nitpick: the California gold rush took place in the lower
Sierra Nevada foothills, nowhere near the timberline location of
Kingdom Come.) You can see it also in the glistening teeth and glowing
complexion of Wes Bentley and Sarah Polley, looking perhaps too fresh
and contemporary against the mid 19th century grubbiness of their
surroundings.<br /><br />Bentley is the young survey engineer attracted to Polley, the
unsuspecting long-lost daughter of town boss Peter Mullen. And it
shouldn&#x27;t surprise anyone to find their budding relationship given
center stage over what should have been the real meat of the scenario:
the troubled reconciliation between a conscience-stricken Mullen and
his estranged, dying wife, played by Nastassja Kinski.<br /><br />Maybe it wasn&#x27;t written like this, but somewhere in the editing room
the focus shifted away from the tragic consequences of Mullen&#x27;s
Faustian bargain, upsetting the already lopsided narrative balance in
favor of the (more photogenic) younger actors. Consider it a token
olive branch extended to an audience asked to endure a long, cold, and
otherwise uninvolving drama.<br /><br />Bentley himself is allowed the final, inexplicably optimistic epitaph,
after the town of Kingdom Come, and the compromised reign of its
founding father, have both achieved their (not unpredictable) fiery
purgation. &#x22;They&#x27;re like kings&#x22;, he tells Polley, gazing in awestruck
admiration at the gray parade of pioneers bringing civilization to the
untamed American wilderness. Nobody mentions the fact that all this
activity is at the compulsion (and to the ultimate profit) of the
railroad monopolies, but never mind. It&#x27;s a silver lining to send the
paying customers home happy, and set the shade of Thomas Hardy spinning
in his grave.
