In this otherwise engaging film, the speech by the female actors is
disturbingly anachronistic. Their speech sounds like generic end-of-the
20th century American: rushed, slurred, decreasing volume and clipped
or swallowed at the end of their sentences. The film is set in
California, but long before Valley Girl became Hollywood movie
standard. Contrast this with Mullan&#39;s &quot;accent.&quot; The interpersonal
communication, especially in the more casual dialog, displays a
distinctly late 20th century urban/suburban attitude. This seems like a
directorial problem, an attempt to produce a natural/&quot;naturalized&quot;
immigrant speech which only a great UK actor like Mullan can do, while
the others, from their European roots, have only the accents and speech
patterns they absorbed in 20th century California and environs to fall
back on (another IMDb commentator half humorously suggested that this
regression was due to the very cold weather during the shoot).
