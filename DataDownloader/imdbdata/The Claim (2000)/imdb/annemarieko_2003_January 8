2003_January 8 

Rented this movie knowing nothing about it, but realized immediately that
it
was &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot;. Some years ago Alan Bates starred in a
&quot;Masterpiece Theater&quot; version, and it was one of the most moving stories
I'd
ever seen, sending me to the book which I've read many times.  It
certainly
seemed like a good idea to transfer the story to the 1860's frontier, but
for some reason this film lacks the emotional power of the Hardy story.
The
scenery and realistic portrayal of both life and death are so rarely
shown,
that I thoroughly enjoyed that aspect and the beautiful scenery of &quot;The
Claim&quot;.  Thought Sarah Polley (and everyone else)looked cold, disheveled
and
plain enough; they just didn't seem to have much to work with.  Had to
keep
rewinding to hear the dialog over the music which was just an annoyance,
not
an addition.  Please don't let this keep you from reading the book or
catching the BBC production.
