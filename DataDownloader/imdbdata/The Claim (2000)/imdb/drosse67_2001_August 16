Anyone who has driven through a ghost town in Nevada or Arizona, only to
leave fascinated, should watch this movie.  The story is about a town in the
Sierras, circa 1867, with an uncertain future after a railroad surveyor
comes into town.  There is a buried secret in town, harbored by the town's
founder and lawkeeper, and the arrival of the surveyor slowly brings the
secret to surface.  New stars Wes Bentley and Sarah Polley seem a little too
&quot;squeaky clean&quot; and are certainly no match for Warren Beatty and Julie
Christie from &quot;McCabe and Mrs. Miller,&quot; which this movie resembles in many
ways (right up to the climactic fire).  And Natassja Kinski is all but
wasted, spending most of her moments in bed.  But the film has a good
premise, and is beautifully photographed.  Recommended.
