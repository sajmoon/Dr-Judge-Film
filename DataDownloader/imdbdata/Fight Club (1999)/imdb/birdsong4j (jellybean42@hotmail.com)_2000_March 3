fight club is a shockingly accurate commentary on our times.  it addresses
the issues of frustration and discontent with society and the guidelines
society imposes on us in regards to what constitutes &quot;success.&quot;  the film
is
not about a group of men who see violence as &quot;their way to get back into
society,&quot; as one reviewer previously stated.  on the contrary, these men
see
their fight club as a way to _withdraw from_ traditional society and, in
effect, find out what is necessary to them.  by giving up material
possessions and living life outside traditional society, narrator and his
comrades come to find out what ideals and principles are _really_
important
and necessary in their lives.  in its second half, FC has been likened to
several things, most notably Stanley Kubrick's 1971 masterpiece, &quot;A
Clockwork Orange.&quot;  certainly parallels can be drawn between the two
movies;
clearly Clockwork's futuristic society of &quot;ultra-violence&quot; is eerily
similar
to FC's modern society.  both tyler and his fight club, and alex and his
droogs display characteristically anti-social behavior which often
manifests
itself through violence and the treatment of women as objects.  the
violence
and objectification can be justified because they are certainly elemental
to
the character development of the droogs/FC members.
aside from the obvious similarities to Clockwork, i think that a number of
parallels can be drawn between FC and William Golding's &quot;Lord of the
Flies.&quot;
the basic situation in both &quot;Flies&quot; and FC is a group of people who
&quot;create
their own society,&quot; with their own rules, heirarchies and power
structures.
both societies are created out of some necessity: in &quot;Flies,&quot; it is
necessity of basic survival on a deserted island, in FC the necessity is
finding a way to re-frame life experiences and re-define the concept of
being successful (i.e. the idea that success is defined by a feeling of
self-worth, no matter how it is obtained, by living life exactly as you
want
to, rather than by the amount of material posessions you own or by being
&quot;socially acceptable.&quot;  in short, it is about learning to see life in a
different way.).  in FC, as in &quot;Flies,&quot; we witness the gradual, yet
inevitable decline of both societies, and the loss of control by both
leaders (ralph and narrator, respectively).  however, in FC, the basic
concept (changing a person's views on life) survives though the social
sub-structure deteriorates.  in my opinion, all three of these works
(Clockwork, Lord of the Flies and FC) are brilliant commentaries on our
time.  knowing this, we must also realize that none of these works can
simply be taken at face value.  to the viewer who does this, they will
appear to be extremely violent stories with no redeeming moral value.  if
this is what you think about fight club, you don't understand
it.<br /><br />reviewer Lorenzo Hernandez stated that he was surprised by the number of
female fans of this movie due to its portrayal of women.  i do not
understand why this is surprising.  women are certainly capable of
recognizing a wonderful, well-written, brilliantly directed movie
regardless
of whether or not they agree with the film's message.  fight club is
unequivocally one of the best movies released this year.  the fact that
parts of it may shock or disturb some viewers does not negate its merit as
a
great film.
