Just watched the film on TV, I have seen it now about thousands of
times and it still gets better and better all the time. David Fincher
is one of the best and leading directors in the world, and this movie
is a great example why. I'm not sure what is the main lesson of this
film, but my opinion is that this film is showing how boring it is to
live a perfect life, when everything is bought from IKEA. A shallow
life is not a good life. Fincher shows what is needed to do when you
are bored and want something new and exciting for your life. This
&quot;Fight Club&quot; is just one example for the new life. Every actor is doing
a marvelous job so it's beautiful to watch them move and talk to the
camera. This film is not just another &quot;violence&quot; film, violence of this
film is different, it's art not just blood and sweat. Everything in
this film just clicks, very good job Mr.Fincher.<br /><br />- Joni
