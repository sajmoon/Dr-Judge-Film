After first reading the novel I was initially apprehensive about the film
as
it is almost a rule of thumb that film adaptations never really come close
to achieving the message that the book tries to get across. This is where
Fight Club is a soaring success. The casting is almost flawless with Pitt
and Norton delivering what are arguably their best performances to date.<br /><br />The scene is set with &quot;Jack&quot; our lead man (Norton), trapped in a dull,
lifeless existence where his apparent lack of importance on this earth
leads
him to seek refuge in self help groups, posing as a victim of testicular
cancer and tuberculosis to name but a few. This gives him the release and
sense of importance he so longs for.
This is where we meet Tyler Durden, a mysterious self destructive man who
shows Jack and others that we are not unique or special through the means
of
secret underground bare knuckle fights where the mayhem spreads like
wildfire.
Without giving too much away this movie pulls some punches and a major
twist
(as per usual with Fincher films). Fans of &quot;Se7en&quot; and &quot;The Game&quot; will not
be disappointed in this truly classic (and thought provoking) look at
modern
day life through the eyes of a man.<br /><br />
