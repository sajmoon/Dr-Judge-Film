1999_November 29 

Easily the best film of 1999, director David Fincher takes a powerful
tour-de-force through society as it stands today.  Almost every line drips
with social satire, Norton makes one of the most convincing performances
of
the decade as a data analyst plunged into a dark underworld by Tyler
Durden
(Brad Pitt), who opens him up to a new world where there is more than
print,
colate, and fax.  It's thought-provoking, hilarious, and heart-breaking
all
at once.  A modern masterpiece by all means.
