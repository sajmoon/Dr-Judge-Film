This is a set-piece for two of the finest contemporary actors in Norton
and
Pitt. Their performances as the narrator and Tyler Durden are superb, as
any
other review herein will show you. The cinematography is good, directing
fine and the script at times good.<br /><br />However, I was disappointed with the movie as a whole. The actors are
clearly leading up to a climax which was predictable, had you seen more
movies of this thriller/drama/action genre. If you want a brilliant
ending,
watch Primal Fear (Norton excellent), if you want a suave and well written
script watch Chasing Amy and for an action movie with brutal fight scenes
Raging Bull. For a complete movie that will move you and not leave you
feeling empty and short-changed then the superb American History X or
Marathon Man may be more your scene.<br /><br />The plot and so on is probably heavily disclosed in the reviews contained
before and after this, beware reading these may lead you to anticipate the
easily predictable &quot;TWIST&quot;.<br /><br />Disagree with me after seeing all of the suggested movies, I dare you,
here
is the list again: American History X, Chasing Amy, Marathon Man, Primal
Fear and Raging Bull.
