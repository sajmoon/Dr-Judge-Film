I liked this movie but it wasn&#39;t life changing and thought provoking. I
liked the twist at the end but not even that could, in my mind,
catapult it to the status it has. The movie is enjoyable, I just think
that it isn&#39;t one of the best movies in history. For me to consider a
movie to be truly great it has to stir up emotions, not just make you
think. A movie to be considered great has to touch the viewer on an
emotional level and have the people still thinking about the movie even
after the movie is over and this movie doesn&#39;t do that. I do recommend
that you see it but I certainly don&#39;t consider it a great movie and it
certainly isn&#39;t in my top 20 movies. Good but totally overrated.
