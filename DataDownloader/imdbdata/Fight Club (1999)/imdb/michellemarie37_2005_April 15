Chuck Palahniuk, the man who wrote Fight Club the novel, is a brilliant
author. For those of you out there that saw the movie and enjoyed it I
highly recommend picking up some of his books. Some of Chuck's books
besides Fight Club are Choke, Invisible Monsters, Lullaby, Diary,
Survivor, some non-fiction tales like Stranger Than Fiction and soon a
horror novel entitled Haunted. If you want to learn more about Chuck or
authors like Chuck you can go to his website www.thecult.net. You do
have to pay to become a member but about 85% of the site is free so you
don't need membership to enjoy Chuck. Also if you like Chuck but hate
to read, most of his books are being set up or looked at to become
movies in the future. Hope this helps any Fight Club fans looking for
more.
