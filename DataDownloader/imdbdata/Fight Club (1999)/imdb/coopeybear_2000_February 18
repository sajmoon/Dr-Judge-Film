2000_February 18 

This is without a doubt the best movie I have ever seen.  The performances
of everyone in the cast from the smallest bit (the priest) to Brad Pitt
(Tyler Durden)are unbelievably believable. The story is told and strung
together in a way that I have never seen done better before.  I understand
that some people aren't able to handle violence, but every single second
of
this film is needed to achieve the goal that was so perfectly
attained.
