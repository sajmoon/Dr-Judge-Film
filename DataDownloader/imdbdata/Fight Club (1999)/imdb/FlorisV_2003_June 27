Contains spoiler in the last paragraph<br /><br />The ending of this movie is famous as one of the all-time plot twists,
for me however it almost completely spoiled what was an intelligent,
thought-provoking movie with a lot of style and cult appeal to
youngsters, by the very capable director of Seven who admits to just
making &quot;MTV-films&quot; in his modesty.<br /><br />The film has many quotable oneliners, and Tyler Durden says a lot of
things to think about (&quot;We don&#39;t have a great war, we don&#39;t have a
great depression. Our great war is a spiritual war. Our great
depression is our lives.&quot; or &quot;You&#39;re not the clothes you wear. You&#39;re
not you&#39;re job...&quot; etc. etc.). Wonderful dialogues (or should I say
monologues) and I love Brad Pitt&#39;s performance, I already knew he
wasn&#39;t just a pretty boy because I saw him in Twelve Monkeys, he&#39;s got
a great voice and a certain rebellious coolness.<br /><br />Besides critizicing the consumption society I think the movie has a lot
more to say. One of the most important topics is rediscovering malehood
(this is no joke, there are actually guru&#39;s who give seminars on this).
Women will deny it but society has become very feminine with it&#39;s
increased communication, meetings, talkshows, the endless shopping, the
huge influence of fashion and the typically feminist illusion that work
is all-glorifying. We don&#39;t get to see a Meat Loaf with breasts for
nothing, I thought that was clearly a message. Men turn to violence
more and more because of lack of control and power, a sign of weakness.
Having bigger muscles no longer helps in this society, having a good
lawyer and a good career does. In this movie men try to rebel against
this society by returning to a primitive but very essential state of
malehood. Just as men fought for their lives in ancient history, these
men fight to feel alive. And this movie shows this in a promising way..<br /><br />only to end with a ridiculous plot twist...Tyler Durden is an alter
ego?? Norton was just punching himself in the face?? And he survives a
gunshot in the throat?? Yes, you&#39;ve read that correctly, in the throat.
According to my limited medical knowledge this sort of results in a
certain lack of much needed oxygen?? Sure, I guess it was luck and the
shot just missed the lungs, but how believable is this?? Chance of one
in a million. So, I really hated the ending and it ruined a great
movie. Too bad, really too bad. It still has it&#39;s moments, therefore:<br /><br />7,5 ouf of 10
