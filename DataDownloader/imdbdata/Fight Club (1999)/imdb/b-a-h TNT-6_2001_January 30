Dealing with our society's faults is not easy task. This movie does it
perfectly and, most important, is not pretentious enough to give answers and
teach people what to do about it. Many questions whose answers are left to
the viewer arise through this film. Is Tyler Durden really crazy? Was the
fight club just a product of the narrator's increasing paranoia or rather a
cure to his frustrations (or both?). Were the people in project Mayhem
finding their real ego or were they just followers? Is the world we see
really what we think it is, and are we actually who we think we are? Is it
possible to change the world, and how far can we go to change
it?<br /><br />Paid critics trashed this movie. Those reviews - some of which were so empty
they were laughable - were exactly part of the system this movie wants to
criticize, and therefore came out like actual glorification. Those same
critics believed that Pulp Fiction dealt with the pornography of violence
(strangely enough I never found any other movie where killers were so
&quot;cool&quot;). Or they strongly believed that the light-hearted American Beauty
dealt with our society's real faults (&quot;...there's so much beauty in the
world&quot;... yeah, I'd like to see what people in Mexico City's surroundings
think about that).<br /><br />Fight Club is a violent movie, but violence is not mindless and it's not
seen as &quot;cool&quot;. It's simply a projection of one man's frustration with a
system whose surface covers emptiness and lies. This man (let's call him
&quot;the narrator&quot;) has a job, nice house, and a decent amount of money. But in
his subconsciousness he realizes that a consumeristic life will never tame
his awareness that much in the world is wrong and he's not doing anything to
change it.
Physically, he is suffering from insomnia but inside he knows - because he
is part of that system itself - that he's been keeping his eyes shut for
years. As a consequence, he simply tries everything that would make him feel
far away from being part of the world he knows. He starts going to cancer
support groups and this makes him feel better - dying people show more
humanity than anybody he's acquainted with, and being next to death sort of
makes him feel numb. Eventually, a woman without any disease - like him -
shows up and that's when he realizes he's hiding, rather than fighting.
Thus, the beginning of &quot;Fight Club&quot;...<br /><br />If you've never seen the movie you might think this is a rather depressing
or very-intellectually &quot;boring&quot; film. It's not. There are exceptional
graphics and it's very funny, the performances are excellent - especially
Edward Norton's. Even Brad Pitt, who I never thought was anything special as
an actor, is very impressive here.<br /><br />The movie came out little more than one year ago. Will it be a classic in
the next years? Let's see.
As for my take, it's quite possibly the best movie or the
90's.
