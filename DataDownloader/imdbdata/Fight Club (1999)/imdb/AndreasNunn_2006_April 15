This film is my favorite movie. It is well written, well directed and
well acted. The surprising ending changes the film when you see it a
second time because you see it with other eyes. Edward Norton and Brad
Pitt are really great actors and they fit pretty well in their roles.
David Fincher, a great director, made after his great movie se7en
another masterpiece who is really worth watching.<br /><br />Just Marla does not seem to fit in all the time. Because this movie and
its great idea does not really need another stupid love story in it.
But it is in it, which so I can not change it.<br /><br />After watching the film five times I decided to read the book, and it
was good, too. There some changes in the film and the ending is also
changed. So the book is even better than the film, but the atmosphere
of the film is so great, you can not imagine these pictures in your
head by reading the book.<br /><br />That the movie didn&#39;t do very well at the cinemas seems not to fit.
Everyone who has seen the film likes it. But it&#39;s the regular Hollywood
film, it seems to be too much like an independent film and seeing men
fight with each other does not turn many women on. So even if this film
seems to be a film made for men, watch it is brilliant and life
changing.
