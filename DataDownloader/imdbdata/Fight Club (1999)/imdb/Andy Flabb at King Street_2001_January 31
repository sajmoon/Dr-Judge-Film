I didn't expect much fighting in this film. when i rented it, i thought it
was a horror called 'fright club' about a boogeyman with a big club for an
arm who ate nice food because he had to eat food or he would die. and
drink
water. anyway, it has Ted Naughton as a guy who loves his job but gets
beaten up by Brad Spitt and goes mad and tries to bring down the
government
with his mates. it wasn't very funny. the best part of this movie was when
they fighted. i'm going to set up my own fight club with my mates. well,
it'll just be me on my own just like in the film. oops. ellen abomba
carter
is like a nurse or something who has to help Ted.<br /><br />I give 'fight club' two black eyes and a broken pinky out of a possible
knockout.
