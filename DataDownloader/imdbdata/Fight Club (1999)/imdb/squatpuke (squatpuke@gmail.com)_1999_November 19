1999_November 19 

I gave this movie a seven....It was very slow for the first 45 minutes, then
you couldn't seem to keep up with all that was happening.  When the end
comes down, your left thinking about all the stuff that happened....even the
stuff you were sleeping through that 1st 45 minutes.<br /><br />Pretty weird story.  Kinda scary...really show's how out-of-control our
minds can be.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I liked it our not....gave it a seven for some good acting. 
IMHO, The bizarre sexual stuff could have been left out without
dihibilitaing the movie in any way.
