2000_April 4 

I thought the movie was GREAT! Before I saw the movie I thought it was
going
to be a lot of fighting, that it would be boring. When I went out from the
cinema I said, &quot;GOT DAMN, That movie was good&quot;, my friends agreed with me
and I wouldn't hesitate if somebody would buy me a ticket to see it again.
I
thought it was good because it was so different, nothing I had seen before
and Edward Norton and Brad Pitt acted really well. Thanks to them and rest
of the crew this is one hell of a movie.
