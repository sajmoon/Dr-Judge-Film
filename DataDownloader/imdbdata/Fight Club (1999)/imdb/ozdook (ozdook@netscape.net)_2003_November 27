I want to start by saying that &quot;Fight Club&quot; is, in my opinion, one of the
best movies ever made, if not THE best. The plot is fantastic with the
revelation at the end dotting the i's. I don't want to write a lot about
the
story/plot, because one word can describe it: Perfect.
The acting is FANTASTIC, with a capital F. Both Brad Pitt's and Edward
Norton's acting is mind-boggling. I think that Brad Pitt should have
received an oscar for his portrayal of Tyler Durden and Norton at least a
nomination. But, unfortunately the academy doesn't award provocative
in-your-face movies (at least not usually), although Fight Club should
have
received at least one oscar. Helena Bonham Carter is &quot;bloody marvellous&quot;
as
the chain-smoking Marla. The entire cast, down to the guy at the airport
talking about a dildo, is fantastic.
And the writing. My god! It is the best writing in a movie, ever. Lines
like: &quot;With a gun between your teeth you speak only in vowels&quot;, will
forever
remain in movie history (in my books at least).<br /><br />If you get Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and David Fincher in on a project...
well, that's all you need. You have an instant classic.
