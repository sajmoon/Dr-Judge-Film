1999_October 27 

There is no denying that this is a fun piece to watch.  From the very
beginning we are drawn in by the voice of fed-up-edness (Jack's), who is a
voice we may claim to be our own.<br /><br />There are so many ideas/issues brought up in the story, however, that will
keep me thinking about it for a while.  'What does being a man mean?' and
'what does it mean in the context of our consumerist society?'  And 'should
we (the audience) trust the voice when it comes from a huge money-making
machine, known as the film industry?'  It seems a little crazy to cheer on
the voice when it is denouncing it's own source.<br /><br />Aside from these ideas, the film is well done--and you will find, upon
reflection, that the violence is justified by the story.  The story will
stay with you long after the credits have finished rolling.
