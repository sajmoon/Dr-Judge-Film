Some films are just incredible because they make you think about
yourself and question your morals and principles and stuff. This is one
of those and that's why it's so great. I think this is Norton's best
performance to date (though he was great in The Score) and Pitt, well,
I have trouble complimenting him because he was so believable that I
still hate him for being a stupid manipulative imaginary 'friend'. I
can't wait to read the book because they're always so much more
detailed and this story obviously has near infinite depth. The major
twist (every one probably knows about it any way) makes the ending to
this film one of the more inventive and meticulously planned ever.
Besides the credit well deserved by the writer, the film is great also
due to the way it's shot. In particular I noticed the lighting always
gave the right effect as did the music.
