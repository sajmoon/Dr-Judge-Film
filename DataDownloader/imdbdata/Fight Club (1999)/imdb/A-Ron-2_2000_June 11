I feel that this particular movie will become one of the defining moments in
early part of the 21st century, once academia really begins to see the
problems that have been unleashed by post-modernism and identity politics. 
Yes, I have heard the film described as fascist, yes I can see some Ayn
Randian undertones, but I think most of that really misses the ultimate
point that the film is trying to make.  America presents a certain image of
what it feels a man should be, but sabotages and undermines our ability to
achieve that at every step in our socialization process.  This film points
out possible reasons for this... &quot;we are a generation of men raised by
women.&quot;<br /><br />Now this is not a misogynistic comment (as I have seen many attempt to
infer), but instead an indictment of the masculine culture in America. 
Masculine virtue has been undermined consistently by the mercantile nature
of the modern state and has not been replaced with anything beyond Gordon
Gecko-esque promotion of greed (which is why I find the end of the film to
be the most important part, even if it may be a bit simplistic and
short-sighted).  When the only 'virtue' provided to men is that of
acquisitiveness (which was never a virtue before the rise of the modern
state in Europe), then we cannot be surprised by the selfishness with which
men act in our society.  When men abandon their children, or neglect their
families, they are acting completely within the modern, capitalist paradigm.
 This is why we cannot talk about these problems intelligently in a public
arena.<br /><br />I find it humorous that this film (or the Matrix for that matter) will be
pointed to the next time some kid blows away his school or kills himself,
because Fight Club is one of the only examples of popular media that
actually attempts to deal with the real issues behind these problems. 
America has killed God and morality, we have gone beyond such limiting
concepts as good and evil, and now we are paying a price for it.  However,
too many people profit from this viscious cycle for there to ever be a
significant change, therefore the film presents us with an fantastic
alternative (watch the movie).<br /><br />The nuetering of the American male is a process that goes on every day, it
is perpetuated in the media and the schools.  Masculine virtue may be dead,
and perhaps that is ultimately what Fight Club was trying to tell us.  Or
perhaps there are still ways to reconnect with something more primal in our
gender, perhaps there are ways for us to look deeper into what it means to
be a man.  This film was one of them, I hope that it is a sign of a shift in
the media toward intelligent films about the idea of the masculine rather
than simple action/morality plays.<br /><br />Fight Club is a complex film that has managed to capture and illuminate a
moment in time in America.  I hope that it is something that men can see and
reflect on.  I hope that this film inspires men to think about what it means
to be a man and why being a man is not something to be ashamed
of.<br /><br />
