Fight Club's concept was ingenious.  I loved how it satired our
materialistic, womanizing society.  In todays day and age, violence is
treated as something that should be suppressed.  Then we wonder why
incidents like Columbine occurr.  If people don't have outlets for their
anger they are going to turn to something that is very destructive.  Anyway,
the point is, the beginning of the movie was interesting and exciting with
the new fight club.  Then it seemed the movie went off on a tangent with the
beginning of Tyler's army of anarchists.  From then on it appeared the
director tried to put a bunch of story lines together that just didn't fit. 
I admit it surprised me but I think the message got lost towards the end of
the movie.
