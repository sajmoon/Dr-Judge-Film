I can't believe it's taken this long to finally see this movie.<br /><br />Although I could've done without some of the blood, the delivery was
top notch. The climax, about 15 minutes before the end, was definitely
worth the wait, and the entire movie keeps you guessing about what's
next. I felt like I was left hanging at the very end, wondering what's
next, but then again, I've only seen it once. My wife hated the 'gore'
(mainly bloody faces and knuckles), but loved the story line, and we'll
probably watch it again very soon.<br /><br />I definitely see why this is a cult film, and I look forward to the
re-watch!
