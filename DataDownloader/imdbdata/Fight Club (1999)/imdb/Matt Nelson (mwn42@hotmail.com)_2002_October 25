No spoilers here, but this may be a comment for those who've seen Fight
Club
and are thinking about watching it again.<br /><br />After looking past all the violence, extreme cinematographic techniques,
computer-enhanced images, and other tricks Fight Club plays on us, we see
another level to this film.  It's a show about young men trying to find
their place in society at the end of the 1990s.<br /><br />Edward Norton and Brad Pitt play a couple of typical guys in typical
situations for men of their age, with no idea where to go with their
lives.
(Okay, you can argue that Pitt's character isn't so typical, and that he
has
some idea what to do.  I'd say he's only about a half-step ahead of
Norton.)
These guys went through school, graduated college, and got normal,
thoughtless jobs (jobs, not careers) because they felt it was expected of
them.  Now they don't know what's expected of them.  Their fathers are
gone--can no longer tell them what to do.  They've been confronted with
opposing images of what constitutes a man all their lives--the cold,
power-hungry yuppie; the sensitive, caring friend to the environment; the
politician that cheats and lies to the people he represents; the
attractive
actor/model who don't seem to be capable of having an original
thought.<br /><br />They're finally coming to a point (and this is where Pitt is ahead of
Norton) where they have to figure out what _they_ want to do with their
lives, or give up live by these images society presents them.<br /><br />Convinced that real life and growth come about from conflict, they start
fight club.  Norton and Pitt's characters discover that in this repressed,
politically-correct society, the best way to really know yourself, the
only
way to really grow, is through conflict.  They fight to see what they're
capable of giving out and taking.  They fight to conquer each other, but
more importantly to conquer themselves.  They fight to recognize each
other
as human beings and to gain respect for themselves and each other.
Whether
you're offended by the violence or not, you have to appreciate the
symbolic
importance of the conflict here.
