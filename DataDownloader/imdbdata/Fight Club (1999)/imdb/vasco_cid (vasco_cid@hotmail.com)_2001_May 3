Why does everyone overrate Fight Club as IF it was a masterpiece?<br /><br />Why is Fight Club considered one of the all-time best?
I don't know! Maybe this is me. I don't feel very attracted to movies with
many violence, maybe I don't like to be confronted with the dark side of
society nowadays (probably not the dark side, but 75% of
society.
I'm sorry, maybe, I didn't express myself well enough. I watched and enjoyed
many movies with violence, but my  point is I don't like  (I'm sorry again)
movies depicting very much misery. I believe that Fight Club couldn't have
been shown otherwise.
Anyway, I told you already that I didn't enjoy many with this odd picture,
but as your mind and costumes may be somehow different, you may enjoy it and
since this is made out of opinions you may rate this almost piece of crap
however you want, but I can't give anymore than 4/10. <br /><br />
