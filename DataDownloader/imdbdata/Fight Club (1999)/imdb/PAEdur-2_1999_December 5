1999_December 5 

This is a very refreshing movie.  No forced or overly happy ending.  A film
that seems to be easy to follow which slips you up on banana skins its
placed slowly through out the film.<br /><br />Its nice to see a film where you are laughing at them and not with em.  And
you will laugh a lot, even if you feel a twinge of guilt for doing so.<br /><br />Best Film Brad has been in for a long time.<br /><br />Strangely very little to do with fighting though.
