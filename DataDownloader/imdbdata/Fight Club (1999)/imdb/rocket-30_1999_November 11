1999_November 11 

A lot of me liked it alot but a little had a few reservations.  I don't
understand how the Norton character could become leader to all these men
when he talks to himself and beats himself up. All the disciples of the
fight club sacrifice their lives as societies clones to become Nortons
clones. I think that was a little silly. I did however enjoy some of the
peculiar camera angles, and I rate the movie highly before the
schizophrenic
plot is delivered. People think this is an intelligent twist because they
didn't pick up on it. I think there is no reason to pick up on it when no
evidence is provided. Fight Club was the stupid persons idea of an
intelligent movie- like The Matrix.7.5/10
