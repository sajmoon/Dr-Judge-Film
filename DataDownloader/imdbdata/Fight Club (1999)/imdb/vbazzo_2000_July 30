What is &quot;The Fight Club&quot;? Maybe the strongest and most daring movie of the
year. David Fincher is brilliant. He has this amazing capacity to make
movies electrical, powerful and disturbing. The smallest details of this
movie are so well-done that the final result was perfect.
The movie is about a man. A man lost in a pathetic life where collecting
furniture was his major excitement. A man who couldn't sleep. A man looking
for salvation.
After meeting Tyler Durden, his life changes in many ways. He discovers his
violent side, his willing to be free. Both create the ultimate therapy for
people who can't find a meaning to their lives: The Fight Club.<br /><br />There men beat each other only to feel alive. Is this impossible? How many
people enjoy boxing anyway? After the club becomes famous, though, Tyler
starts to create something that will go out of control soon, and that will
change that man's life forever.
Fantastic dialogues. Amazing character development. A much better twist
then
6th sense's. A flawless complex script. Very funny moments. Very tense
moments. Nonsense. Insanity. Mischief. Mayhem. Soap.<br /><br />This movie really can rock your world. It made me feel much different about
life itself, and is one of the best movies EVER. Highly recommended to
anyone who likes to think.
Edward Norton is amazing. Brad Pitt does his job well and David Fincher
shows us once again that he has a great potential and must keep us addicted
to his movies. A high praise to the guy who wrote the book as well. There
is
a guy who knows lots about humanity.
10/10
