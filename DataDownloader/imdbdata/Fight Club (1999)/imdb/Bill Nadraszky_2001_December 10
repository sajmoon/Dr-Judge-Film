When i first saw reviews saying that this movie was ir-responsible to be
made I was hooked. I waited for video and have seen it twice and am going
to
buy the DVD. This movie is great!<br /><br />The movie may seem to just be a glorification of fighting, especially
street
fighting but underneath are very important 1990's type
subtexts.
There is materialism, fear, and ego behind everyone, so the film says.
Most
important in this film is the way that it portrays the classic modern
american male of our time as lacking in a real hunger to strike out and
fight for anything, more apt to look for an easy way to get dinner than
hunt
for it.<br /><br />The movie uses flashbacks well and is at least as good on a second viewing
as it is on the first.
