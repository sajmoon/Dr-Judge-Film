Ahh here it is. My review of David Fincher&#x27;s classic adaption of Chuck
Palahniuk&#x27;s transgressional fiction master work. &#x22;Fight Club&#x22; tells the
story of a corporate drone (Norton) who (like many) is displeased with
his life. He, in turn, forms a &#x27;fight club&#x27; with Tyler Durden (Pitt) a
soap maker to escape from this sedative lifestyle. Now right off the
bat, if this movie were shown to the original pioneers of film (i.e.
Porter, Chaplin, Capra) I can safely say that upon completion of the
film they would promptly scream, yell, cry, and then explode. . .
.maybe. They would definitely be appalled by what they would see.
However, this does not make &#x22;Fight Club&#x22; a bad film. For, film, like
literature, can take on many forms and eventually evolve over time.
Though the themes displayed throughout the film are definitely strange
and at times shocking, they are also peculiarly thought-provoking and
at times pragmatic. The movie&#x27;s messages on defiance and nihilism are
deeply rooted within it&#x27;s very intelligently written script. The
dialogue is hilarious and at times disturbingly provocative. Brad Pitt
and Edward Norton are two intensely talented actors, and seeing them
work together on screen is really entertaining. Though anyone who
watches this movie will walk out of the film talking about Brad Pitt&#x27;s
unforgettable portrayal of Tyler Durden. Pitt&#x27;s obvious dedication to
the role, paired with the near-perfectly written script he was given,
makes for a character that I will quote many a time to come. Another
aspect that I found particularly unique was the cinematography. I found
that Photographic Director Jeff Cronenweth did a noteworthy job with
the visuals of this movie. He really succeeded in using lighting to
accentuate just how dismally somnolent the narrator&#x27;s life is. I also
felt that the use of lighting towards the end of the film was also very
aesthetic. As for direction, David Fincher is . . . .well he&#x27;s David
Fincher. The guy really knows how to put a film together. In the end,
&#x22;Fight Club&#x22; is a dark, dreary, appalling, hilarious film that I am
glad to call a classic piece of American culture.
