&quot;Fight Club,&quot; directed by David Fincher, is one of the greatest movies in
modern cinema history. Like Citizen Kane (not that Fight Club is in the
same
league as Kane), Fight Club is both misunderstood and loved. There are
those
among us who despise the movie for it's violence and political views, and
there are those who love the movie for it's look at the effect of violence
on society, it's style, and the wonderful acting by Pitt, Norton, Carter,
and Aday. I am one of the latter. The movies also stands true to the
messages in the novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. Violence is not
the answer. (This is one of the best lines in the movie: &quot;Self-improvement
is masturbation...self-destruction is the answer.&quot;) Anyway, I hope that
others will discover this film for what it really is: a wonderful piece of
art.
