Every time I watch &quot;Fight Club&quot; I notice something new and exciting about
it.  Few films can do this, so to me this is a remarkable
feat.<br /><br />I truly believe this film is a generational thing.  Pretty much anyone
over
40 will not like this film (my Dad just didn't know what to think when he
saw this one).  Those who have grown up in this era can only appreciate
it
the best (right now, I'm 20 years old).<br /><br />There are numerous things about this movie that grab me.  The ideas
that's
presented about a soulless world overwhelmed by mass consumption really
hits
it home with me.  What's interesting is that Tyler Durden has a
nonconformist stance on modern society yet at the same time, he's
indoctrinating everyone about this.  In effect, he's making everyone
conform
to his own vision of non-conformity.<br /><br />This movie came out in 1999 a year where the &quot;twist ending&quot; was en vogue
(&quot;Sixth Sense&quot; previously did it) and I never saw this twist coming.  I
won't reveal it here (go see the movie if you want to find out) but it
amazed me.  This has you watching the movie over and over to pick up on
the
clues.<br /><br />Everything about this movie was flawless.  It speaks to me on so many
different levels (some I may have yet to discover).  Go check it out for
yourself.  Some love it, some hate it, but if it's made you think, then
their job has been done.
