The first time I saw Fight Club, I didn&#39;t really take it in - I was
tired and bored and not in the mood for a dark and depressing film like
this. We turned it off halfway through, after about 90 minutes of not
paying attention. What a mistake that was.<br /><br />I watched it again several months later when it was being shown on TV.
Being only 13, I failed somewhat to absorb the deeper themes and
concepts of the film but was highly, highly entertained by the Joe
Everyman tale of a person so bored, unhappy and in the need of change
in their life (it reminded me very, very much of American Beauty in
this regard).<br /><br />Three years on, I watched it for the third time and it absolutely blew
me away. Pretty much everything about it is perfect - plot, acting,
direction, music - it all combined into a single perfect narrative
package.<br /><br />Where do I start? The acting is out of this world. I can&#39;t claim to
have seen many of Edward Norton&#39;s movies (in fact, only this and
American History X), but his performance here was brilliant as the
aforementioned Joe Everyman who also provides excellent, often deadpan
narration that not only propels the story but is entertaining and even
funny, a rare feat. As for Brad Pitt, until I saw Fight Club I had
dismissed him as another pretty-boy, somewhat-talented actor more
suited to romantic comedies than dark dramas. How wrong I was. His
acting abilities are in full flight as the suave and confident
antagonist of the story, Tyler Durden. Helena Bonham Carter is also
great as usual, playing the leading lady (of sorts), Marla Singer.<br /><br />Or the story, based on the book by Chuck Palahniuk. While it
essentially retains a simple three-act plot, it constantly twists and
turns as to never let the viewer remove their eyes from the screen for
even a second. This is NOT a movie about fighting. The overwhelming
theme of the film is of anti-consumerism and challenging the values
systems that have been put in place through advertising. The fighting
itself serves as a way for the characters to escape from their
repetitive, depressing, boring and most importantly sterile lives and
experience feeling that the material objects deemed so important by
their values system cannot give them.<br /><br />Director David Fincher produces one of the finest directorial efforts
of recent times. The mise-en-scene he generates is terrific - harsh,
sterile, postmodern - and there are several scenes that showcase his
mastery of some unusual camera techniques. His directing here is
strange in the best possible way. One particular short fantasy scene on
a plane especially stands out.<br /><br />Fincher was concerned that traditional film music bands wouldn&#39;t be
able to tie all the film&#39;s themes together, so he recruited the Dust
Brothers, an electronica duo who had never recorded for a movie before.
What a contribution they make. The score is postmodern, sterile, and
artificial-sounding, perfectly in keeping with the ideas in the film.
It also manages to create a mood without usually being noticeable, a
difficult trick to pull off correctly.<br /><br />While loved and hated by equal numbers of critics, Fight Club is
undeniably one of the greatest films for many years, probably the best
of the 90&#39;s. Go and see it - you won&#39;t regret the experience, even if
you don&#39;t think it&#39;s &#39;your kind&#39; of film.
