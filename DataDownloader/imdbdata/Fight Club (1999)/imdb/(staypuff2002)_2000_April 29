ok, if you read the other comments about this movie, you will know what
its
about. Im sick of all the women saying that this is just a stupid male,
beat
the sh*t of of someone movie, because its not.This movie has an incredible
plot, great actors, and its very well directed by David Fincher. This
movie
has deep meanings that many ignorant people cannot comprehend.The violence
of this movie is not as sicking as other comments make it seem. This film
is
extremely smart and funny . This is a film that is not for every one, but
is
extremely entertaining. Just see it, and dont take it so seriously, and
you
will enjoy it.
