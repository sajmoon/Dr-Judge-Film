1999_October 24 

I agree with all the accolades spoken in reviews before me.  This
filmdefies categorisation in that it deals with so many elements. No doubt
it will be classified in the Vid stores as comedy/drama, but that hardly
captures it.  It is one of the strongest EXPERIENCES in movies I've had in a
long time (and I've seen some good films this year-for example, American
Beauty).  Nothing touches F.C. for sheer impact visually, emotionally,
philosophically, psychologically...etc.<br /><br />My expectations of  this movie, were shattered within a few minutes of the
beginning.  I remember thinking &quot;this movie better be good, it's pretty
long&quot;.  Well, I come away from it reminded of a driving trip I took in the
mountains of Oaxaca, Mexico where after 2-3 hours of surreal beauty, I said
to my wife: &quot;whew, enough already. I gotta come down!&quot;
