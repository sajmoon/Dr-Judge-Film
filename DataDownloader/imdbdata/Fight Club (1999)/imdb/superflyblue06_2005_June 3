2005_June 3 
I was in need of something to do one day. And I turned on the T.V and
it was on! I was not going to watch ! I was going to give it five
minutes of my time and right it off as another movie about macho guys
doing macho things.As the plot began to thicken i was enthralled by the
character of Tyler. One thing that I found quite peculiar was that as
everyones seemed to change wardrobe Tyler remained in the same clothes
in previous days! To me this was very reminiscent of &quot;Identity&quot;
starring John Cusack. At some points in the movie i found the fighting
a little gratuitous it is definitely not a movie for little kids! The
movie is a knockout(no pun intended)! I think that if you have not seen
it then you need to see it and if you didn't get it watch it again. I
was a little upset with myself that i had not watched sooner! This is
the ultimate tale of reality versus fantasy! It has become one of my
favorites and if you are in the mood to think a little out side the box
this is perfect for you!
