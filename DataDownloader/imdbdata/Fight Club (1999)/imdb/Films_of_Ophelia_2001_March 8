This film can be described in one word: genius.<br /><br />A white-collar, middle-class, boring man (Norton) who suffers from IKEA
obsessions and insomnia does on a downward spiral when he meets and
befriends a charismatic stranger named Tyler Durden (Pitt) through
unfortunate events. Together, they from their own secret society type of
cult for disillusioned men like themselves called &quot;Fight Club&quot;, in which
they beat the hell out of each other for a catharic release from the
materialistic society they wish to escape.<br /><br />Everything is peachy keen until a chainsmoking she-Devil aquaintance of
IKEA
boy's named Marla interferes with he and Tyler's friendship by means of
sex
and seduction. Marla (Carter) begins a physical relationship with Tyler,
while she and IKEA boy engage in a challenging, deeper love/hate
relationship. Marla opens his eyes to how carried away &quot;Fight Club&quot; has
grown, (now referred to as &quot;Project MAYHEM&quot;), and everything begins to
fall
apart into the pieces of the puzzle that complete this story in the
mind-blowing finale.
Fight Club illustrates the growing isolation we feel from each other and
the
crazy ways we fulfil our need to be drawn back together. It's an
intriguing
look at underground culture and the spiritual release it brings.<br /><br />This is the A Clockwork Orange of our generation. This is my favorite film
in the world. It has changed the way I see things. This movie literally
rips
you from your chair, beats the s**t out of you, and spits you back
out...and
damn, does it feel EUPHORIC! ;-)
