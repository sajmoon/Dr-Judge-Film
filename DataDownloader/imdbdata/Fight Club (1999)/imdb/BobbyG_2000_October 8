2000_October 8 

This is an interesting and unusual film with great acting, directing and
production values.  Unfortunately, the film grows tiresome after the first
few thrashings.  The message is a good one, but the delivery is a mess.  The
sad thing is that lots of testosterone laced young ones will probably get
the wrong idea and take the more brutal and sociopathic parts seriously and
even model this behavior to some degree.  Can't the idea of rebelling
against social brainwashing be made less violently?  There must be a gentler
way to show that all we need is shelter, clothing and food...everything else
is just filler and working twice as long as you have to to clutter up your
life is madness...making a national past time of watching oversized men run
into each other in a futile attempt to bring a ball across a line on a field
is sheer lunacy.  A film that gets people to think is a great thing.  But
there must be a better way to do that than this one does it.
