A little darkness in an already dark field, but Fight Club lets it all hang
out.  Don't see it with your parents or a timid girlfriend--do see it with
the same people you saw Blade Runner with in high school.  Brad Pitt does
what he did best in 12 Monkeys, and Ed Norton &amp; Helena Carter both take a
turn for the worst in a stylish way.  You might not like it, but you might
not forget it, either.
