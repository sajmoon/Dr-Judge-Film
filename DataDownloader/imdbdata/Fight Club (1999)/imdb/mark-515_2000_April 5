2000_April 5 

A dark satire on the bombardment of consumerism in todays world and the
reaction against these constant distractions. With sly digs at Starbucks
Coffee and Ikea furniture the fast but witty script is crammed full of
throwaway one liners with Brad Pitt being excellent as Tyler Durden.
Equally
good is Ed Norton who lost weight especially for the role as a man beaten
down by life so much that he resorts to being physically beaten up by
people
to lift him up. The film is shot with alot of style and the accompanying
soundtrack by the Dust Brothers compliments the dark urban setting. Fight
Club is a must see movie that grabs you by the throat at the start and
drags
you with it all the way to the end. Excellent. Oh and if thats not enough
Meatloafs in it with breasts!!!!(it's true)
