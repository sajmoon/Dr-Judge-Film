Innovative, intriguing, controversial, genius and downright beautiful.<br /><br />David Fincher's directing is awesome, Chuck Palahniuk's narrative is
captivating and Laray Mayfield's selection of actors is spot on; Ed
Norton is as brilliant as ever, Brad Pitt actually fits his role
(*cough* Troy) and the selection of extras never seem out of place.
Even Meat Loaf's titties couldn't ruin the pace (and in a strange way
enhances it).<br /><br />Undoubtedly the most interesting analysis of contemporary society since
Pulp Fiction. Go buy it and don't drop the soap.
