I won't go on about the story line like some.  This movie is excellent.
Acting was great-once again, Edward Norton, your the man- and dispite Brad
Pitt's rep as being the man more infamously known for his good looks than
his acting, he proved me wrong.
Can I go on about how great the twists and turns the film had?  I won't,
but it was all good.  I haven't seen this complicated of a plot since
&quot;Being
John Malkovich&quot;. In fact, watching the whole film, especially towards the
end, was kind of like being IN Malkovich's head.
I think I should also call attention to the great job the writers did.
I saw the previews and expected some stupid excuse of a violent action
movie.  I overcame those prejudices, saw it, and loved it.  Yes, it's
violent, and yes, it has about as much testosterone as a stadium full of
hockey players, but it's also as dark and fast and scary as an indoor
roller
coaster.
