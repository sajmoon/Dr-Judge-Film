If there's one movie out there that really makes you evaluate today's
society, this has got to be it. The convincing performances by Pitt and
especially by Norton allow you to lose yourself in the story. If you
haven't
read the book, you should. It is only about 200-some pages but is just as
compelling as the movie.
Another thing I love about this movie is how quotable it is. The sharp
narration and dialogue is derived mostly from the book, but some was not
and
the presentation of it is simply superb. Norton should have won an Oscar
for
his performance. If you haven't seen him in Primal Fear and American
History
X, definitely do so. Pitt is also extremely witty in what is his best role
to date. His sex-symbol status aside, the guy can really
act!
As I said before, the movie will certainly change the way you look at how
you live your life and what you work towards achieving.
