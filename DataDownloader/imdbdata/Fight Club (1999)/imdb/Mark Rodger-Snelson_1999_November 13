Fight Club is fantastic. A real sign of the times, it's kind of like an
ultra-violent schizophrenic version of 'Office Space' and even with all this
mayhem it maintains a steady flow of comedy as well.
 The acting cannot be flawed with Edward Norton stealing the show but this
is not to say Brad Pitt was not on form - he was brilliant as well. It was
also nice to see Helena Bonham Carter taking on such a rough 90's role as
opposed to the period dramas where she is normally cast.
 The social commentary presented via the narrator is absolutely venomous
towards our times and spits out against corporate greed, consumerism and
90's apathy like nothing else I have ever seen. It's a film that you think
about long after you have left the cinema - it's still lingering with me two
days on. 
 I probably should have read the book first but I am definately going to
purchase a copy as soon as I find one. Well done Mr Fincher and crew for
such a fine film.
