This is truly superb, one of the best films I have ever seen. This film
has a very funny sense of humour, gritty fight scenes, clever concepts,
a very clear political agenda and most importantly, one of the best
endings of all time.<br /><br />David Fincher has seriously come on leaps and bounds since the
disappointing Alien 3. As with Seven, his directing is spot on. It's
dark and murky just like an underworld fight culture would be. At the
same time, very good special effects are integrated within the film.
The plot moves forward tremendously and sets the viewer up nicely for
the ending. There is a fair amount of shock imagery in the film such as
Norton's fight against Jared Leto. I don't mind violence in films but
that particular scene is so relentless that it is hard to watch.<br /><br />Acting from everyone in this movie is superb. Norton gives his best
performance after American History X. His delivery of dialogue is laden
with sarcasm and is a joy to watch. The many character transformations
he goes through is entirely believable. Pitt is also on top form,
definitely better suited to playing edgier roles such as this and
Twelve Monkeys to Meet Joe Black et al. Helena Bonham Carter is very
sexy in this role, whilst at the same time, utterly repulsive. A very
strong lead certainly does this film many favours. Meat Loaf is also a
great character in the film who has a great rapport with Norton's
character.<br /><br />A surprisingly psychological film, I would like to know what Freud
would have thought of this film. This film actually got mentioned in
one of my University lectures so it obviously has impressed the
academic world somewhat. What is really fascinating is Tyler's anarchic
solutions and how his ideology, whilst floored, does have its
intentions. His Marxist beliefs are much more pure than those of Lenin
in the Communist Russia era as Tyler even intends for himself to be
insignificant within Project Mayhem. The relationship between Pitt and
Norton is great to watch as it leads to great character development and
adds to the humour of the film.<br /><br />Anyone in to suspense, black comedy, psychological thrillers or action
will love this film. It is definitely one of the best films of the
decade and has a massive following that will love it forever. Brad Pitt
has never been so good and his performance as Tyler Durden is now
legendary. Fight Club has clever concepts to spare and oozes style,
offering much more than entertainment.
