Hi fellow film lovers. As far as movie goes, it&#x27;s a classic. This is
really for the people who tore it down, or more specifically the people
who tore other people down for liking it. If you didn&#x27;t get get it,
it&#x27;s because most likely your like Edward Norton&#x27;s boss in the movie,
or your like most people. This movie wasn&#x27;t made for MOST people, this
movie was targeted at an audience that knows there is something
disturbingly wrong with our world, society, and our culture today.<br /><br />If you did not see that, it&#x27;s because you Can&#x27;t See it. So bashing this
movie or people who like this movie, (More specifically those who like
it, everyone&#x27;s entitled to their own opinions)just proves not only do
not see the decay and regress our cultural society, but that you are
also apart of engine that drives it.
