Fight club is definitely yet to be challenged in the genre of cult
films, of all the cult films i have seen clockwork orange has come the
closest but still lacks a touch of brilliance that fight club brings to
the table.<br /><br />Firstly i want to talk about the performance of brad pitt, it has to be
the best of his acting career. The character of tyler durden is
completely mastered, the film&#x27;s interpretation of the books tyler, was
very accurate, a person who believes that working for what society
deems to be normal, sitting in a office typing your life away to buy
things we don&#x27;t even need, is hit head on from the performance of brad
pitt.<br /><br />David finchers view of the world according to fight club is
frighteningly realistic, in parts of the film the philosophical theme
can leave you thinking whether working for the rest of your life is
actually the answer, Finchers unusual concept of directing was perfect
for fight club, in my opinion if anybody else had tried to interpret
chuck palahniuk&#x27;s novel, it would have crashed to the ground faster
than the release hot shots part deux.<br /><br />The quotations used in the film are scripted to perfection, delivery of
the quotes are also perfect. Also i have to complement fincher again on
his choice of actor/actresses, Norton plays the part of a sleepless
insomniac dead on and helena bohnan carters role as the girlfriend
dragged into the crazy world of the narrators character is nailed, The
way the philosophies are brought into the films are also quite
controversial, (I would tell you specific examples but i cannot include
any spoiler), controversy is the core of any remotely successful cult
film, which makes fight club the most crucial ingredient to the genre.
