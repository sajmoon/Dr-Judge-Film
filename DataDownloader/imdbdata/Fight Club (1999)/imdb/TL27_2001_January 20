2001_January 20 

This is a movie you either love or hate.I happen to love it.There has never
been a movie like it before,but rest assured the imitators will be following
in droves.The directing is unbelievable! I cant wait for Fincher's next
film! Ed Norton (as always) is outstanding.And Brad Pitt(who,for some reason
i'm always trying to find reasons to dislike)was very convincing.Pitt is
blessed with some of the best lines in moviedom that I have heard in some
time.Very memorable!
    I recently bought this film on DVD and I have already spent 5-6 hours on
the first disc alone! I cant wit to get to the supplemental disc.The
packaging is also unique and very creative.The DVD really brings out great
points even more than the theatre at times.I could go on and on,but most of
what I have to say has been said on this board already.For you people who
dont get it,YOU DONT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE MISSING!
