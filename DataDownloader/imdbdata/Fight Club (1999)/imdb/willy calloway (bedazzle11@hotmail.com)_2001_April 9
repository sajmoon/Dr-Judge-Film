I'm sure you've all seen this by now, so I'll just tell you about my
favorite theme in the movie. For the astute, you will have ascertained that
the alluded-to theme is pain. We've been taught that pain and fighting is
just in certain cases: fighting for self-defense, for love, for ones
country. So why the controversy over 'Fight Club'? Because they fight for no
apparent reason. Perhaps because of boredom with life. I wonder if there is
ever a situation in which pain in and of itself could be a good thing. How
much can you know about yourself, how truly free are you if pain is always
secretly influencing your opinions? Remember the incident with the lye?
Powerful, beautiful. I wrote a piece about a similar experience of mine
entitled,&quot;The Cross.&quot;
