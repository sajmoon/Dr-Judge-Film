2000_January 9 

A nice piece of seditious, counter-cultural, social comment from Chuck
Palahniuk and excellently interpreted by Fincher with an odd, slightly
weird
twist to setup the conclusion (which is very well built up by both brutally
honest soliloquys by Norton and very interesting cinematography as well).
Maybe all us paupers would like to play a part in Project Mayhem if only to
remind us how fragile our western world is.
