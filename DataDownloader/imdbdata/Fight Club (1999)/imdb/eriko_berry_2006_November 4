The thing I love about Fight Club is the way it kept you entertained
with wonderful... I mean brutal violence. Yet amidst all the fierce
tackling and killing, it makes you think so much! The story line was
brilliant and the twist quite amusing. I have to thank Brad and Edward
for there wonderful acting because I hate nothing more than a great
film being destroyed by tragic acting!I couldn&#39;t find a single bloop in
the creepy film, except I guess for Meat Loaf&#39;s pants falling down. It
contained violence. It contained Jared Leto ( with freaky BLONDE hair,
but its not that that destroys his good looks). It contained humor... I
loved it!
