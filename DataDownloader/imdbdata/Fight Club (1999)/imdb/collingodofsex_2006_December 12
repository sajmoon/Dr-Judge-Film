My favorite movie, excellent directing, great acting, Brad Pitt&#39;s best
work, Edward Norton is also amazing in this movie, a must see. Not only
is it a fun and entertaining movie, but it also has a deeper hidden
message &quot;the things you end up owning you: as Tyler Durden says. It
shows us how society shapes us to becoming different than our true
selves, and that in this process, we all end up creating alter egos.
This movie is original, fun, it is everything a movie should be like,
specially considering the garbage that the movie industry puts out
nowadays. Everyone that is looking for a movie that has more than just
explosions or just an extremely predictable plot should go see fight
club. Not only will you have a blast, but it might also touch you in a
spiritual way, Fight Club is not a movie, it is a religion.
