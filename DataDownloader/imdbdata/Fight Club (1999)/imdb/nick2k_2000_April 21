Great Book, nice translation, and Edward Norton proves himself to be a
versatile &amp; talented actor.   Brad Pitt is surprisingly witty.  Helena
Bonham Carter is threateningly seductive.  A well chosen cast.  What a
mind-trip!   If you haven't seen it, then you yourself should be thrown in
the 'fight pit'.  Mixed reviews of this movie should've been a fantasy.
This film breaks new ground thanks to author Chuck Palahniuk &amp; director
David Fincher.
