on my top ten favorite films of all time i would say fight club is
number 4, but when i first saw fight club i didn&#x27;t really care for it,
mainly because i was half asleep while watching it but the second time
i saw it my mind was blown, because the second time i paid full
attention and i loved it this movie had a great cast Brad Pitt, Edward
Norton, Helena Bonham Carter and Meat Loaf was even good in this, and
the writing was amazing, the first part of the movie kind of focuses on
Edward Norton&#x27;s unnamed character and has a lot of fighting some of it
is pretty brutal and the second part focuses more on the characters and
you see them destroy stuff and some parts of this movie are just weird
one part to words the middle made me cringe actually 3 parts i wont
spoil them thought and also in this David Fincher&#x27;s directing is
amazing but overall fight is a perfect film 10/10
