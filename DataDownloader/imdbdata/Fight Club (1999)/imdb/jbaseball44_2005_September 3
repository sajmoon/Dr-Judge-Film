When i first heard about this movie and all the hype it was getting and
the great comments from people that had seen it, I was a little leary
about getting too hyped up and being let down. That feeling couldn't
have been farther from the truth. Fight club does not disappoint. It is
by far Brad pitts best performance ever and it is a great follow up
performance for ed norton(following up American History X.) The deep
plot and moving life lessons are something that we should all take the
advantage of. Helena Bonham Carter does a great job as marla singer a
women who doesn't care what other people think and has some of the same
ideas as ed norton character(Jack.) But the best thing about this movie
is the ending. It delivers one of the greatest twists of all time. But
you will have to see it to find out.<br /><br />NOTE= If you liked this movie see American history x another great
performance by Ed Norton.
