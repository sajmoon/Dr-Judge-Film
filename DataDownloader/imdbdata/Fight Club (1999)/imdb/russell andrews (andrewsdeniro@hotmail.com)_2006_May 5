First off, this is one of the best films ever made. There is not a
single bad thing about this film. Forget about overly cautious
reviewers &#39;some of the violence is bloody...&#39; etc. If you need to be
made aware of such things then please leave. It says it all on the
certificate rating. If you need some sort of extra sign (like the ever
more apparent &#39;contains strong fantasy violence&#39;etc warnings that are
appearing on every film then you can just forget about this. Forget old
films, forget classic&#39;s this is a great great film. Along with
Goodfellas and Pulp Fiction (Rules Of Attraction not far behind) this
is the best film of our lifetime (twentysomethings) I have no apology
for saying that if you don&#39;t like/understand this film then you&#39;re
clearly less intelligent or don&#39;t understand film or cinema. The film
is so well directed and acted with something important to say. what
more do you want?
