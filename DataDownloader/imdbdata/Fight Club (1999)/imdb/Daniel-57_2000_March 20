Some great movies need time to be recognized as great- long after the
controversy fades away, Fight Club's greatness will still remain, it will
become a cult classic, too bad it was not appreciated in it's original
theatrical release, because it was not the kind of movie that played well
to
today's audiences which are just looking for shallow, mindless, teenager
oriented entertainment. And the other part of the audience who would have
enjoyed it, most of it thought of it as another stupid action film and did
not bother to go see it since it also had a bad publicity campaign. Fight
Club was much deeper and thought provoking than any other movie released
this year. A lot can be said about this film. Watch it. Experience it.
Then
watch it again.
