10,10,10.  I can't stress that enough.  I bought this on DVD, have seen it
about eight times and find more perfections in it, as opposed to what
usually happens after repeated watchings (you see flaws- even Gladiator
suffers from this).
Something I've noticed: people who HATE this movie give the same reasons
as
those who LOVE it.
