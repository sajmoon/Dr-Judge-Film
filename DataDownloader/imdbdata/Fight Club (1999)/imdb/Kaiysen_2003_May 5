I view the movie Fight Club in the same way I do the book, I felt as I a
had
witnessed something revolutionary.  With some exceptions, movies in the
past
two decades have had a somewhat formulaic design.  Although I find it
difficult to explain what this design is, it's easy to tell movies that
deviate from this by the general feeling they leave after viewing them.
For
example, most people after watching Pulp Fiction or Memento probably feel
somewhat disoriented and confused, but in a good way.  These films are
examples of deviation from the norm in a chronological manner.  Fight Club
deviates by making us question not only perceived reality, but the ideas
and
norms that society values(very similar to American Psycho).  Are we too
materialistic?  Are we a generation of disillusioned men looking for a
right
of passage?
Movies which questioned reality and challenged the viewer to see things in
a
varied prospective were much more common in the seventies, such as
Apocalypse Now and even Harold and Maude.  I want the movie to make me
feel
uncomfortable and question the way I view things.  More movies should be
like this.
