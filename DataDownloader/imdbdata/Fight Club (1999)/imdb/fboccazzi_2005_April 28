first: sorry for my English... This movie is one of the most important
ones of the '90: it is a sarcastic portrait of the no-generation, the
generation that has been educated by the television, the first
generation obsessed by advertisement and futile consumer items, the
generation obsessed by body care. The main character is split, as
anyone who belong to this generation: on one side the cynical
integrated assurance worker, on the other side, the wild soul of Tyler.
The most interesting thing is that the critic is not only spotted on
our &quot;inhuman&quot; consumer society, but also on the &quot;social terrorist&quot;, the
trained monkeys. A generation with no hopes, no dreams and no goals but
the ones described by TV advertisement can be easily manipulated: you
only needs to show them a &quot;leader&quot; (as Tyler) and they'll do anything
for him...just like Germans during the NAzi era, or the Italians during
fascism. It is a movie (and a book) that makes you think a lot about
our society, but doesn't give you any answer...very interesting.
