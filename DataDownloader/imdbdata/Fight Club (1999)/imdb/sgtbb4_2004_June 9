It's ironic that a film that is a warning about the minds of easily
impressionable people could have easily impressed so many people. This
film is a warning about the type of life style that Tyler prefers,
doesn't anybody seem to get that? Perhaps it was the creator's idea to
fashion a film that outlines the downfalls of nihilism, and then create
a similar reaction in its viewers. Perhaps the fact that so many people
don't seem to understand the true meaning of this film was the
intention of the creator. If this is the case than I can recommend the
film as a razor sharp satire. If not, then this film falls under the
same category as SCARFACE. I say this because both films flirt at
length with the corrupt, and then tag on a moral ending that frankly
isn't as interesting to the viewers as what came before.
