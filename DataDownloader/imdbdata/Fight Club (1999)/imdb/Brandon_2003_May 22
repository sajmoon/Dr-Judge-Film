Never was the target audience of a movie so evident as it was in Fight
Club.
I have talked to many people about this movie, it is my favorite movie
by
far. It touches on and captures so many things I feel from day to day.
No,
I dont agree with every line pertaining to social conformity in the
movie, I
do however agree with the deeper meaning in this movie.  It is about
setting
yourself free... without drugs.<br /><br />In talking to people about Fight Club I found that most people think that
this movie sucks(if you are a father/mother in your 30-40's... forget it
if
you are 50+) or its the best movie you have ever seen(if you were in your
18-20's when the movie came out.)  It speaks to my age group(and younger)
almost exclusively, our deep anger towards societies roles, and our
struggles with motivation.<br /><br />Everyone should at least try to watch this movie.  Critics hated Fight
Club
because you cannot watch this movie as a plot based, or character based
movie, it is so much more.  Its the first and only movie that changed my
life for better or worse.
