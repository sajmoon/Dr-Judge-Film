Anyone who thinks that Fight club is a martial arts movie,think again.It is
about a lonely insomniac,who stumbles upon a club for terminally ill people
were he finds redemption.
All is at stake when a woman comes across it and takes his place.Then on a
plane,he meets Tyler,a drifter who wonders around and makes soap for a
living.
The two of them form a bond and then start a fight club were a group of
violent men express their violent feelings at each other.
It soon becomes more than a club and turns into an army terrorizing the
city.
When Jack (the insomniac) tries to stop him,the men come after
him.
This is not all to it but I won't spoil it,lets just say there is a very
dark twist in the film which you will never guess.<br /><br />Fight club is a dark,modern and brutally comic movie which you will either
love or hate.The violence is grim,the layout is dark,and the humor is
hilarious.Partly comic horror (if you count the end).I rate
4/5.
