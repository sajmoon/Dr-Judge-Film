I thought I knew the premise of this film: men forming an<br /><br />underground fight club to get back to the basics of raw, visceral<br /><br />`manhood&quot; in our regulated, civilized society. Well, it was about<br /><br />that, plus much more. In what is actually a deeply satirical and<br /><br />surreal tale, Edward Norton plays a young put-upon corporate<br /><br />office hack into our modern consumer culture but vaguely unhappy<br /><br />with his life and attending a multitude of support groups, even<br /><br />though he doesn't share the other members' situations, until he<br /><br />meets an offbeat soap seller (Brad Pitt) on a train and they<br /><br />accidentally exchange suitcases. The two end up living with each<br /><br />other and in a rather bizarre manner, which just gets stranger as it<br /><br />goes, fight each other for stimulation and form a fight club which is<br /><br />soon joined by many willing others. Adding to the intrigue is the<br /><br />interest of Norton and Pitt in another offbeat character Marla, well<br /><br />played by Helena Bonham Carter. Also notable is Meat Loaf's<br /><br />character Robert Paulson, a big man who developed feminine<br /><br />breasts after a bout with testicular cancer. The film is certainly not<br /><br />just about the fighting, which doesn't even begin until a half hour<br /><br />into the movie, although there is plenty of vicious raw flesh and<br /><br />blood grappling and crunching to satisfy all but the most sadistic<br /><br />fan. Rather the story develops into even more surrealistic twists to<br /><br />several surprises at the end much of which I could not predict. The<br /><br />story is so unique, even if the theme is not, that you can easily<br /><br />forgive the reality lapses. I'm giving it a 9 out of 10.
