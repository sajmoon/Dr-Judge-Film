If you are looking for entertainment and mind boggling at the same
time, this is the perfect one for that matter. This movie takes you to
a totally different level. The story and direction are just so amazing
that you can&#x27;t predict this movie until you are very great at
predicting.<br /><br />You cannot tell a specific genre for this movie. It is a thriller,
funny, action, drama, mind boggling, you name it you have it. The
performance of the cast is brilliant and the combination of Brad Pitt
and Edward Norton is a great success.<br /><br />I have to admit that this is the best movie ever and you cannot stay
without watching it. If you are a fan of either brad or Edward, you
cannot miss it.
