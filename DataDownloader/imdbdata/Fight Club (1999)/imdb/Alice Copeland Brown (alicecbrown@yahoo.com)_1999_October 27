1999_October 27 

Is it violent?  Yep, and I could have done without that part.  And I can
very well see why in these Columbine days, why they held off on releasing
the movie.  However, they get in touch with their inner selves with
fisticuffs, not machine guns.  The points could have been just as well
'hammered home' without all the blood and gore.<br /><br />However, &quot;the Fight Club&quot; is also funny and BEST of all, it has some
great
comments on the huge debasement of life that is the corporate existence as
we know it.  &quot;Work at a job you hate to make money to buy stuff you don't
need,&quot;  was aptly said, as are many of the other great lines in this
movie.<br /><br />Brad Pitt is sex itself in this one, showing off those great biceps and
giving us all those wonderfully sardonic glances, along with his throwaway
lines.  There's a great hook in here, which I won't spoil for you.  The
woman is also funny and dark.  Was I cheering when the buildings holding
all
our credit card records went down?  You bet?  &quot;Destroy all the records and
we start from Ground Zero&quot;.<br /><br />but, just as
the telephone was invented concurrently cause the time was right, so the
satire in these two movies.  It was not accidental that the movement to
'free' the American man turns into the same kind of Army brain-washing and
debasement that the military produces.  Robot-like, the guys become just
another version of the corporate drone.  Like many revolutions, this one
turns ALMOST full circle.<br /><br />But just one logic check here: Can you actually shoot yourself in the
mouth,
walk around, talk to people and still stand up?    But why should I
question
this when these &quot;let stuff happen&quot; devotees carefully buckle themselves up
as they speed down the Interstate with no one touching the wheel.
Funny!!!!
