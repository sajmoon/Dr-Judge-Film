Fight Club is a laugh fest from beginning to end.  Brad Pitt is very
engaging as the fight club 'director'.  I was very pleased with the entire
film.  While a great deal of violence is in this picture, it is in a
perspective that makes it cartoonish.<br /><br />Congrats to all involved in this film.  The story, the screenplay, the
acting, everything is well-tuned for good entertainment. And, great
fun!
