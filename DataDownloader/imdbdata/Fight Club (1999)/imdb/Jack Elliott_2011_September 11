I expected this movie to be awesome, let&#x27;s just say it was.<br /><br />You could watch this title over and over again and still be amused.
This is by far Brad Pitt&#x27;s best movie and a definite must watch.<br /><br />Fight Club could practically be under any movie genre, it has elements
of comedy, thrill, mystery, and drama. Only an idiot could mistake this
for a bad movie.<br /><br />The ending is mind boggling and makes you think about what happened
earlier in the movie, so watch it carefully so you don&#x27;t miss anything. <br /><br />At times, the things that are going on may seem weird and out of
control, but they are all part of the plot.
