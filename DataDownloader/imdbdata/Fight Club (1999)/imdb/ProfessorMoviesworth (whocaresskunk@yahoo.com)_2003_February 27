Its a love it or hate it film no doubt about that.  This film is almost a
fantasy in a sense, one step beyond what our world is.  The narrator Jack
is
frustrated with his consumeristic society and when he meets the mysterious
Tyler Durden things really take off.  Tyler leads Jack into a world where
he
can vent out his every day frustrations they start up Fight Club and it
takes off.  Soon though Tyler turns Fight Club into Project Mayhem a group
that destroys and Jack must confront his friend who may have lost his
mind.
The twist this film takes about two hours in is priceless.  This film
should
have been up for several oscars but it was just way ahead of its time so
none of the critics recognized it.  Norton, Pitt, and Bonham Carter make a
great team.  While the critics, the oscars, and even the box office didn't
really recognize this film it has become a cult film for movie buffs and
anyone who is frustrated with their society. Great Film the best of 1999.
