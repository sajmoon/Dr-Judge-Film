There&#x27;s no doubt that Fight Club is one of my favorite movies. Its
attractive and original style, its trapping story, its performances,
its ending and its message turn this sequence of images with sound into
an authentic masterpiece. I consider this film to be one of the best of
all times. <br /><br />Fincher tells us the story of an unnamed character (the narrator) who
has entirely devoted to his job and whose life completely lacks of
meaning. This guy, who is very well interpreted by Edward Norton,
suffers from insomnia and can&#x27;t find the solution to his problem. He
becomes addicted to attending support groups and pretending to be a
victim, which at first seems to be the cure to his sleeping disorder,
but the presence of another impostor named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham
Carter) ruins everything; Norton starts feeling uncomfortable. The
narrator meets the man who is going to help him solve his problem,
Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Durden will try to open Edward&#x27;s eyes; he
will teach him how to leave everything behind, how to forget about the
material stuff in order to discover the meaning of his life. They will
co-found an underground club known as Fight Club. <br /><br />This film is the story of us, the story of everyone. This is a love
tale that, camouflaged by a critic to capitalism and consumerism, talks
about the pursuit of happiness, talks about finding the right person,
the person that takes out our best selves. It is a story that
strengthens values such us compromise, conviction, devotion,
determination and love. <br /><br />Ten out of ten
