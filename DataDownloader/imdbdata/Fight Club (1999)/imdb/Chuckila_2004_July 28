Excellent way to question yourself about the motives behind human
actions.<br /><br />This movie has it's own way of showing the truth about how life should
be taken. It is a movie showing what is going on inside the mind of a
mentally ill person. <br /><br />Along with the brilliant staring of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, it
makes the best movie of all times. I can't figure out a more suitable
couple for this movie, rather than Norton-Pitt. <br /><br />And another hint, watch the movie at least 2-3 times ... you'll figure
out why!<br /><br />Watch it, you won't regret the 2 hours.
