My opinion in this movie is simple..JESUS! This is the the greatest, most
intelligent, most convincing acting I've EVER seen. It's genious, man!
It's
brilliant. My great impression came first after the film, so I watched it
again. From the &quot;rememberable&quot; line : &quot;People often ask me if I know Tyler
Durden&quot;. It's also a kick-back for David Fincher. I've always liked the
guy,
but who don't now? This movie is about a man who suffers from a divided
personality. And this movie tells it so excellent. Vote 10 for this movie.
Because this is the kind of title we want on the #1 place in the top 250.
Just see the damn movie, it will make you go places you've never
been!
