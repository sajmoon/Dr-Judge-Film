Fight club is by far the best movie I have ever seen.  Edward Norton does
an
astonishing job in this film.  I'm usually not fond of Brad Pitt however,
he
did an excellent job in this film. Helena Bonham Carter also does a great
job.  After seeing this movie you will never think of life in the same way
again, it's very captivating! David Fincher(the director) deserves more
recognition for this film. If you enjoy movies with a twist, this is the
movie for you!
