Fight Club is about young men who find a way to let themselves go and find
their true selves and have a sort of Therapy through Fight Club Starrring
Brad Pitt and Edward norton who both give great performances, Pitt who
took
this role to shed his Golden Boy good guy image does all that and more in
this movie which the question can be asked Who is Tyler Durden? this movie
plays with your head is violent and has many twists. Music from the Dust
Brothers is a great extra to this film i personally love it i find myself
repeating the rules of fight club every now and then and for the people
who
Are interested in the movie or want an alternate way to express themselves
and
feel better about themselves do yourself a favor and remember the rules of
Fight Club and as it is stated from the soap company on paper street &quot; in
Tyler we Trust&quot;!!!
