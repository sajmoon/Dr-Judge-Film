I can&#x27;t say much more about this film that hasn&#x27;t been already said.
But I would really like to give it a try.<br /><br />I&#x27;ve heard about this movie since it was released, but still wasn&#x27;t
that interested yet. Thankfully I have one friend who&#x27;d already watch
it and literally made watch too. The result was obvious (This film
causes these reactions). I felt it was too short, it kept wanting more
and more. The way the story is told is unique. But that is not all. The
script, the acting, the photography, etc.(I can go on and on). This
film is definitely a masterpiece.<br /><br />The teasers show only small portions of this film, making it seem like
a mindless fighting movie. This is not the case. The story is about a
furniture obsessed guy, who had insomnia. He decided to form a club in
which he could unleash all of his energy and finally be able to caught
some sleep. But after a while, things went out of control, and nothing
was what it seemed.<br /><br />People often tell me that I am too picky when it comes to movies. That
pretty much nothing impresses me, that I don&#x27;t like popular films etc.
But after watching this kind of film it is difficult to be impressed by
the average film.This movie set a new personal mark in this genre. Like
The Good, The Bad &#x26; The Ugly did it in its genre for example.<br /><br />To sum up, I became a David Fincher fan since I really like films like
Se7en or The Game and of course Fight Club. This is a must see for
everyone who claims they know about films.
