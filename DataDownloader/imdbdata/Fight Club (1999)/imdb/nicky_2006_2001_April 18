This film is a masterpiece, Ed Norton and Brad Pitt are
excellent.
The Film keeps you guessing all the way through and then right at the end
everything makes sense.  David Fincher is probably the best young director
around at the moment, his films are dark and have a brilliant atmosphere. 
Fight Club is probably his best, just beating out Seven.
