2003_August 1 

I have heard of this movie for a long time, however until recently, I got it
and regard it as one of my best favorites. This movie hold my eyes from the
beginning to the end.
the opening credits is illusional just like the hero himself, though at
first I did not notice all those shining wires are the axis of neurocytes
which are transmitting signals.
I divided this movie into three part. 
The first part is delighting. With the hero's insomnia, we explore his life
in a unique and bizarre voyage .
The second part is shocking. To feel walking on the edge of death made me
hold my breath. I felt those guys are really made of steel.
the last part is surprising. Like the &quot;a beautiful mind&quot;, after the viewers
had totally believe the existence and logic of one role, the director would
tear him into pieces in front of eyes and made yourself thinking: what you
see is not what you get. The last scene is romantic with great
power.
It is a mind-blowing movie, which made you think what the meaning being
alive.
