The first rule of fight  club  .... You know whats next.
One of the better , most shocking movies of all time , unfortunately
because
of the lousy publicity made for this movie not many people got the chance
to
appreciate this movie at the theaters.
With a very unique story , a fantastic first person narration
(provided by Norton) and a great visual storytelling , fight club tells us
the story of one more of us , a consumer , whose biggest fantasy is
feeling
that sensation of &quot;Being Complete&quot;.
That is until he meets Mr. Durden , thats Tyler Durden , who shows him the
&quot;real way&quot; , and quoting directly from him :
&quot;Its only after you lose everything that you are able to do everything
&quot;.
Our Narrator (Norton) starts living on a downward spiral of decadence ,
culminating in ... well youll see it for yourself.
Many people did not see ths movie because they thought it was some kind of
action , too much violence kind of movie , well it is in fact a violent
movie , but the word Fight , from Fight Club quickly fades out of your
mind
when you discover the true nature of the movie.
So i recommend this movie to everybody who appreciates a great movie ,
with
great actor , a brilliant direction and , plus , based on a great
novel.
&quot;People always ask me if I know tyler Durden...&quot;
