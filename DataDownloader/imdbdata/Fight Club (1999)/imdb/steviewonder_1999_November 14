1999_November 14 

The story in this movie is excellent and combined with superb acting by
Edward Norton and Brad Pitt this movie is taking it to another level. The
way they describe modern society and the media. With a taste of communism
and loneliness it makes you wonder for days about modern society and what it
does to people.
