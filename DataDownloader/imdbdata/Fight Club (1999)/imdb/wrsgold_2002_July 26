The most telling exposition is Pitt's line that we are &quot;. . .two generations
of men raised (sic) by women.&quot; This is a notion that one would expect that
pudgy, wussie &quot;moma's boy&quot; Roger Ebert to fail to get. And Lord, does he
fail to get it! (The review is available on the imdb) The notion that the
problem is only two generations old is way off base, however. This started
when boys ceased to be taught the arts of hunting and war, about the time
farming became the mainstay of our economy. However, it became its most
insidious when men left home to work and left their sons in the tender,
tearful care of their mothers. <br /><br />En fin, the film is saying that we are taught that the world revolves around
women and the business/government cabal . . . and that nothing else
matters.<br /><br />The film's positions are that:
1. We don't know who we are because we are wired one way (aggressive,
testosterone stuff) and taught another way (tender &quot;no fighting&quot;, conniving
manipulation, pretend to love each other stuff). I agree<br /><br />2. This was brought about by the business/government infrastructure who
support the structure because it makes it less likely that they will be
challanged. I disagree, though, by removing men from the rearing of their
sons it has made a bad situation worse. At the very least it has certainly
heightened the internal conflict in men. I do agree that business/government
are happy with the status quo, for this and other reasons they scarcely
understand.<br /><br />3. That the need for this kind of physical outlet for men is so serious that
virtual &quot;violence drones&quot; can be created. I agree, anyone check the growing
membership of right and left-wing militias recently?<br /><br />4. That the solution is the destruction of the economic infrastructure. Brad. . . as much as I like you as an actor, you wouldn't last 5 days in the
environment this movie would create.<br /><br />The solution is far more complex and relies on our ability to find a way
that will allow boys to be reared as men rather than women in drag (or men
who are old well before their time).<br /><br />For provoking these thoughts, and for getting the (always hilarious) wussie
response from Ebert and for being well filmed and acted the film is highly
recommended.<br /><br />Oh, one more thing. Ebert is also wrong about the injuries incurred in fight
club. Bare knuckle fights went on for 50 rounds or more, some one had to be
knocked out. And until fighters donned gloves to protect the squeemish from
the sight of blood, no one died from a brain injury (a little known fact
that was a favourite of James Cagney's and which he would drop whenever
people started talking about). There were far fewer broken bones than one
would expect, noses and fingers being the most common.
