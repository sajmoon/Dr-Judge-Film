Whoever posted the comment that said that this movie is so good
because it has so many interpretations is right on, and for the
record, I think that anyone who doesn't like it should try seeing it
again...it really does get better every time, and you are probably not
looking past the surface.
With that in mind, I'd like to offer a slightly different take than I've
ever heard on it.  While learning about religions of Asia, I saw a
movie on Rinzai Zen Buddhism, and it was almost exactly like
Fight Club!  The young monk trying to enter the Zen temple was
first told he could not enter, and to leave, and only by showing his
persistence and waiting outside for days was he allowed to join
the group (exactly like the movie).  Once inside, he joins a group of
others who have no separate identities, but work together towards
enlightenment under a ruler who beats them often to help them
&quot;see the light.&quot;  So in this theory, Fight Club (actually, Project
Mayhem by this time) = the temple; Tyler = the Zen master (note
actual quote from the movie--&quot;I am the Zen master&quot;); 
enlightenment = the realization Tyler wants them all to come to
(consumerism, etc etc, again note quote--&quot;I am enlightened&quot;)...I
think it's striking.  Off the wall, I know, but if you watch the movie
after learning a little about Rinzai Zen you will see it, I
promise!
So here's a new one for you: now the movie is about consumer
culture, midlife crises, closet homosexuality...AND Rinzai Zen.<br /><br />SEE IT!!!!  It is at least a 10/10.
