One of the objective of any movie is to provide entertainment.  I couldn't
find that in this one.  It was far away from recreation. The whole film
jumps from one scene to another creating confusion.  The viewer is hoping
OK
now something will happen but alas. Only watch it if you have more than
hour
and a half to waste.
