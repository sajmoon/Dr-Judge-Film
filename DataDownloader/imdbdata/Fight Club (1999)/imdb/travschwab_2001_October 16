After seeing Fight Club for the first time, I thought of how original it
was
and how it made you think. Most movies are just there with no message to
go
home with. Some are made just so producers can have more money. And most
of
the time those films suck because there is no depth or any thought put in
the movie. But this movie is...whoa...it makes you think and I love movies
like that. Fight Club is funny, violent, action-packed, depressing,
disgusting, offensive (not to me of course), intelligent, mischevious and
controversial. It's funny because people didn't like the movie just
because
they're either afraid to admit that its true of how society is today or it
was &quot;too violent&quot; to consintrate on the story and what the film is really
about, what with the fighting and such. That's bull. Saving Private Ryan
is
fifty more times gory than Fight Club.  So anyway, go buy it or rent
it or whatever. Just watch the movie.
