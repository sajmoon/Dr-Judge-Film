Welcome to the masterpice of the new age. Get ready for some great
lines by Tyler Durden like, &quot;the first step to eternal life is you have
to die.&quot; The story gives us insight into the life of the insomniac
played by the brilliant Edward Norton, who encounters Tyler Durden aka
Bradd Pitt who changes his life. The movie features some mind bending
moments and exceptionally brilliant lines.<br /><br />Bradd Pitt plays the character to remember for a lifetime. People who
have read this book and not seen the movie will be surprised at the
tact with which the director has handled this subject and tried to
include every detail about the characters on the screen. The movie
would certainly have easily been a disaster if it hadn't been exactly
directed the way it is. David Fincher definitely has a winner on his
hands here.
