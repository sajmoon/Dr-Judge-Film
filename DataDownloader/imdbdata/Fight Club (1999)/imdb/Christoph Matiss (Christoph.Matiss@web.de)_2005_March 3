No doubt, Fight Club is one of the best films of the decade and it
deserves its overwhelming good reputation. Edward Norton plays his
second-best role after his terrific performance in American History X
and Brad Pitt does best in dark and bizarre films so he is absolutely
right in Fincher's masterpiece. From the beginning it becomes clear
that this is no film for people who just want to relax in their seat
with some popcorn and a cola trying to spend a smooth evening. You
really have to think and this is what makes it a good film. A man is
frustrated about his life and searches for something completely
different. Honestly, that's not a very new idea but Fincher is able to
give it a new direction. He radicalizes his characters and shows
brutality in a direct and uncovered way. The perversion of society gets
a face in Tyler Durden and the ones who follow his &quot;new way&quot;. The
narration is what impressed me most. Who are absolutely shocked when
you have to realize that Tyler is not the one he seems to be... To give
a conclusion: Not my favourite, but a very, very good film!
