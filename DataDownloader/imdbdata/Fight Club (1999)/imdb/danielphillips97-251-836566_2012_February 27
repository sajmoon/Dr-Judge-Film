If you judge this by its title and think it&#x27;s just about fighting then
you&#x27;re wrong, this is so much more. It&#x27;s a complex and intelligent
psychological thriller with a brilliant twist and a great soundtrack.
It just keeps getting better and better as the film moves on. This is
easily one of the best films, if not the best film I&#x27;ve ever seen in my
life. I&#x27;m sure enough people have gone into the plot so I won&#x27;t need to
do that, but it&#x27;s definitely an exciting and thrilling experience as
well as making a big impact and goes beyond where most films go. it was
on my mind all day the day after I watched it. Whatever you do, watch
this film.
