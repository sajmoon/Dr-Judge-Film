This movie wasn't what the name implied. I was shocked after the movie
ended, not because it was bad or anything, but the whole idea and plot.<br /><br />A talented actor like Edward Norton is perfect for the role of a neurotic
office worker, and Brad Pitt is also perfect for his role.<br /><br />No other actual comments, go and see the movie if you haven't seen it yet.
You won't be disappointed.
