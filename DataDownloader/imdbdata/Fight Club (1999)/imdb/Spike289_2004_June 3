 From the beginning to the end of this movie you are on the edge of
your seat just waiting to see what happens next. Granted the violence
was a little extreme it made its point rather well I mean fights are
bloody what do you suspect but if your one of those people with a weak
stomach I highly recommend that you don't see this movie because it is
very intense and will probably disturb you. The nice thing about the
plot is that its always messing with your head, personally I found the
ending to be a little disappointing even though it makes a hell of a
lot of sense I thought it could have been better. Another thing that I
thought to be very intriguing about the whole thing is that the second
time that you watch it it is you catch the little things that you
missed the first time that you saw it and you'll like it even more and
for once for the type of movie this is the ending didn't ruin the whole
movie for you even though as I said before it was a little
disappointing both actors I believe did a magnificent job playing those
roles. If your watching it for the first time don't get mad watch it
again and you'll get it.
