Being a certain kind of film geek, I don't follow actors and actresses'
films as much as I am a Director Groupie, and David Fincher is one of those
directors whose films I will always watch, sight unseen.  One of the reasons
for this (from me) high form of esteem is the film `Fight Club'.  There has
been so much written about this extraordinary film, that I'm not going to go
into anything specific about it, certainly not the `message', or the great
acting by Brad Pitt and Ed Norton, or the brilliant screenplay.  What I am
going to vehemently aver is that `Fight Club' is one of the most visually
stunning films produced in the last two decades.  Fincher displays top
visual form in this film and creates such brilliant and disturbing eye candy
that it is almost impossible to absorb in one sitting.  There are many
individual scenes (for one, the entire first 15 minutes) that are so great
that I will just grab the DVD and pop it in to the player to sit and watch
for a bit, trying to see what I've possibly missed the last twenty times
I've seen the film in the last five years.  <br /><br />Like the time I saw `Gladiator' and got quite upset over some of the in your
face, non-cartoonish violence and a friend of mine chided me with, `Um&#133; the
name of the film is &#145;Gladiator', what did you expect?', `Fight Club' is a
violent, disturbing film &#150; the title, after all, is `Fight Club'.  However,
disturbing and violent never looked so cool&#133;. Until Quentin gave us `Kill
Bill'.  Fincher's slick video direction past is glaringly resplendent in
`Fight Club', and while I don't recommend it to all, I recommend it to those
who don't look for a structured film.  However, above all recommendations, I
recommend that you read the book by Chuck Palahniuk first &#150; it is a definite
enhancement to the film viewing experience.<br /><br />--Shelly<br /><br />
