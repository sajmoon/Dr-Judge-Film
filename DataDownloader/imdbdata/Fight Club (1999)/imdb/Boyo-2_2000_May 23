I cannot honestly say the majority of movies I have seen in my life ever
said anything to me, personally.  Meaning I can relate to the characters on
any level.  This is a rare occurence but I got quite a lot out of this movie
-  a feeling maybe I am not as alone in my isolation as I thought I was.
Quite a bit of food for thought. Maybe that's why I also thought most of it
was really very funny - it hit so close. <br /><br />I hated &quot;Seven&quot; but this movie really is amazing.
