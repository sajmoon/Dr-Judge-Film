This movies is so awesome...you can watch it every day for a year and still
come up with some new strategy or detail every time if you watch closely.
A
couple of friends said they didn't finish it because they couldn't watch
past the first 30 minutes...I kept telling them to keep watching because it
would blow them away.  They finally did, now we watch it during most
parties
we have!  Brad Pitt's finest performance...
