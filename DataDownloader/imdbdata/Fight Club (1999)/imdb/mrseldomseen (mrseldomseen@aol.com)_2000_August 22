Excellent first half. Chaotic second half. Terrific direction from Mr.
Fincher. Brad Pitt has fun in his role. Edward Norton dominates the film
with another top-notch performance. The first half of the film is classic
with the redefining of male masculinity via fight clubs. When the film
segues into Project Mayhem was where my problems with the film began. I
would have preferred that the film remained within the confines of the
fight
club. And the film's twist, though unnecessary, had a nice bit of dementia
to it. Could have been a great film, but it is still a good one and worth
checking out.
