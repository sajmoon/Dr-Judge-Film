1999_November 29 

Well the first thing I wanted to do after seeing Fight Club for the first
was to see it all over again. Cause this movie is simply brillant. It has
everything from violence to humour. I wasn't expect to laugh at all before
to see it. The trailer is not really good cause it shows all the violent
scene and give you a bad general idea of the atmosphere of the movie. But
it's impossible to gave you an idea of what the movie is in two minutes. As
it's almost impossible to resumate the movie. Anyway I had a lots of good
laugh. But the general humour and mood of the movie is kinda cynical and
dark. It's also a great cristism of today American Society and American Way
to Live. Since I can't resume this movie I just can tell you that you'll
feel like smarter after seen this movie and you'll maybe stop buying Smart
Mop after seeing it on Infomertials. It might open your eyes too about your
way of life and change for ever you vision of the U.S.A . Some might find
it
all fucked up. But I think it's one of the ten best movie ever made. The
only thing I have to tell you is &quot;Go see it twice for fully understand
everything in this movie&quot; (4 or 5 times would be mendatory for low IQs
=)
Thanks David Fincher for this brillant movie
And aslo thx to every actors (and of course Actresses) for their wonderfull
performences !
