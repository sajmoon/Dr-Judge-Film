Most films that use voice over narration are sophomoric efforts at
best, mainly because voice over tends to be used as compensation for
lack of good storytelling tools. That is, one of the first rules of
fiction being &quot;show, don&#39;t tell&quot;, a film ought to be able to convey its
intent without directly telling the audience anything.<br /><br />However the film makers pulled it off, Fight Club&#39;s narration actually
works as an enhancement to a film. Perhaps it is because the narrator
never actually gives any information; perhaps because Norton&#39;s
commentary is sardonically amusing. The fact is, it manages to succeed
where thousands of films leave the viewer gritting their teeth in
irritation.<br /><br />But this doesn&#39;t explain why Fight Club is worthy of the big 10/10. In
addition to sharp directing, entertaining dialog, and talented cast,
Fight Club wipes away the paper thin veneer of weak civility that
replaces the raw, honest reactions so sadly lacking in contemporary
culture. It is a refreshing breath of fetid air, so free of the
insultingly cheap perfume of imitation sympathy and courtesy, that the
viewer is made glad to experience the visceral, id-inspired attitudes
of the characters on the screen. However immature and reprehensible the
thoughts expressed may be, at least they are not patronizing themselves
and others by pasting a Spackle of uninspired, new age crocodile tears
many find themselves pressured to display.<br /><br />Perhaps that is what is most personal in this case. This is only a
fraction of what Fight Club has to offer, as it not only tears at the
materialization and feminization of modern culture, but stylistically
renders a vivid portrayal of a madness that is itself a cure for a
greater madness. This madness is that which is experienced by those who
have been subtly told through constant media reinforcement how to mold
into the ideal human being; an ideal that is never held by those who
adopt it, but is given them by advertisement and the weak minded who
won&#39;t bring themselves to spew out a foul tasting wad of mucous for
fear of offending somebody they will never meet, about whom they truly
care nothing.<br /><br />If this review appears relatively vague, it is deliberately so. It is
not intended as an attempt to intellectualize the film because the
language is just meant to convey what is interpreted as theme. Fight
Club is one movie that should never be spoiled by a review. There are
no specifics given here because every rendition done by anybody other
than the actors involved (or Chuck Palahniuk himself) has always fallen
short of the memorable manner in which the film delivers. The
pseudo-intellectual psychobabble of this review is simply an amateurish
attempt to create meaning without trespassing into the sacred
experience that is Fight Club.<br /><br />Whether the above review hits a mark or sounds like chicken scratch,
Fight Club ought to have a liberating effect of some kind on almost any
viewer. Almost seven years after its release, Fight Club still hits
with bone shattering inspiration and head splitting satisfaction.<br /><br />Watch with reckless abandon.
