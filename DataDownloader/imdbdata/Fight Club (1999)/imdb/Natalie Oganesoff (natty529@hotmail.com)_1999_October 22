1999_October 22 

The first time I saw the trailer for this film, I thought &quot;what is this?
what a mess, a bunch of fighting... I don't like Brad Pitt movies&quot; but then
I thought, &quot;I love Edward Norton movies!&quot; I finally saw the film yesterday
and I must say that it made me really think about a few things! Can guys
really know nothing about themselves until they have been in a fight? while
I don't know if that is true I do know that for the characters in the film
at least, fight club helped them to figure out who they were. A follower an
innovator or an a*****e.<br /><br />This film will probably shake you up a bit, but it  will also make you
reevaluate yourself and the things that are important to you... that is
certainly a good thing!
