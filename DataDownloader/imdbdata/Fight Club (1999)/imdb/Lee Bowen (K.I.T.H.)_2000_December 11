I wouldn't have bothered watching this thinking it was about bare knuckle
fighting, until a friend paid me to watch it on pay per view in the hope of
taping it for her.<br /><br />Watched it, amazed, stunned, made me think etc... Wanted to watch it again.
Bought the DVD - Watched it again - Great a 2nd time around too. Reading the
book as we speak.<br /><br />If you like thought provoking films, like Brazil, 12 Monkeys, The Matrix
then you should like this.<br /><br />I won't go into the plot as it deserves to stay secret until you watch it.
Needless to say 15 % at most is about bare knuckle fighting!<br /><br />Give it a try it may just be the best film you watch for some
time.
10 out of 10 and go watch American History X too !!!!
