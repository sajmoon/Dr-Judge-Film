2009_September 18 
I do not know why but I believed that this film was mainly about some
people who fought each other for pleasure and from my point of view I
was not prepared to watch it for that reason. It was only recently when
I saw that the film was in the top twenty five or so films in the IMDb
top 250 and it had attracted over 300,000 votes that I decided to buy
it and watch it. A month ago I did and intrigued I stuck with it even
though I started to nod off at times. I watched it through to the end
and was surprised by the twist and I decided that it was relatively
entertaining film but no masterpiece. I am glad I watched it and I have
to say that it is not a bad film but I probably wont be watching it
again. I am not a shallow or unintelligent person but this film just
doesn&#x27;t ring any of my bells. I will take some time to try and tell the
potential viewer why. I like all types of films from comedy to deep
introspection but this film seems to try to get its basic message
across in an incredibly complicated way. I suspect there are additional
subliminal messages and I am sure that the product is trying to work on
several different levels but it seems too cluttered as a result. I
cannot say its an important film unless you like contemplating your
navel and if so this film is for you. Some of the time the self
indulgence of inventiveness depending on how you see it works but when
it doesn&#x27;t it is just boring. I can see why the film has such a high
rating and why a lot of people like it but I am just not one of them
and repeated viewings are not going to change my mind. I cannot
recommend anybody watch this film because it is a great piece of
cinematic brilliance but simply because opinion is all and it helps to
see the thing your are commenting on.
