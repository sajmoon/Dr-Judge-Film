I thought I had already seen the worst movie of 1999 but after watching
&quot;Fight Club,&quot; this was wrong as &quot;Fight Club&quot; took the honor. There was no
point to this film and it was the waste of talent for two otherwise
excellent actors.<br /><br />There is not much to say about &quot;Fight Club&quot; because there was nothing
worthwhile to remember. After the first ten minutes of this film, I realized
I was watching a film that is best described by the condition of the house
the two lead characters were living in old, delapidated, rundown and an ugly
home. Brad Pitt made a wrong career move selecting &quot;Fight Club&quot; and Edward
Norton just wasn't thinking as he made his decision. <br /><br />With a story that made no sense, action that was non-existent and
performances that were poor; &quot;Fight Club&quot; was nothing more than a time and
space filler for the studios.
