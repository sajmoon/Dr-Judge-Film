2001_August 2 

I saw this film before &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and I have to say that in the
spirit of &quot;Fight Club&quot; I came out of the cinema truly understanding the
film's tagline of &quot;You do not talk about Fight Club&quot;.  I spent the evening I
came out from the cinema phoning everyone I knew cheering  that it was an
excellent and truly enthralling movie - but then what?  Well, they all
wanted to know what it was about; and of course I could say absolutely
nothing because the more I thought about how to describe it and the plotline
the less sense I could make of it and the more clearly its twists and turns
became integral to any description.<br /><br />For anyone out there who has not yet succumbed to the delights of this
movie, I'd hate to spoil their fun.  But trust me, Norton and Pitt turn in
applause-worthy performances; the script is taut and funny; and Meatloaf
actually makes you believe he can act.  It's a dark comment on these dark
times and well worth the ride.
