A beautifully gritty movie.
plot builds tempo as the symbols and gestures weave through the
story
A revolutionary insanity is pushed throughout the film supported by great
acting and amazing technical features.
Dark, gritty and shockingly real, a movie that lowers you swiftly down
deeper into a chaotic darkness punctured with light.
