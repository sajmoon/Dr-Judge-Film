this movie is one of the greatest movies ever made. now i know those are
some pretty strong words, but in my opinion this movie ranks right up
there
with the godfather and citizen kane.the acting was superb, the story was
amazing, the plot twists were incredible and really just the overall theme
of the movie is an amazing concept that astounds me. lost souls looking to
find a way out, this flim shows what american society can do to an average
person. i just can't say enough about this movie and how it amazed me.
this
is also proof of how bradd pitt is one of the greatest actors out there
and
is overdue for an oscar 10/10 stars
