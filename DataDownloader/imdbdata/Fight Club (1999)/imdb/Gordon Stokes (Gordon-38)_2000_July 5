Yet another movie that wants you to think it's built around &quot;BIG IMPORTANT
IDEAS!&quot; and has &quot;SOMETHING TO SAY!&quot;...without really having any of that.  So
many people watch this and talk about how it &quot;made them think&quot; and claptrap
like that.<br /><br />Here's a few of the things that &quot;Fight Club&quot; made me think:
1. Could the ending have been any worse?  More contrived or arbitrary in any
way, shape or form?
(After a little more thought, I decided that the answer to these questions
is no.)
2. How many more movies are we going to be subjected to that are desperate
to show us how crass materialism is ruining our lives?
3. Is it possible for David Fincher to come up with yet another &quot;Forced
Super-Gloom&quot; set design for his next movie, or has he blown his wad with
&quot;Alien 3,&quot; &quot;Seven&quot; and &quot;Fight Club&quot;?<br /><br />Hey, whattayaknow, it did make me think.<br /><br />The real problem with this movie is that it had a lot of promise.  The
concept of the Fight Club itself could have made for a much more interesting
movie than the pseudo-revolutionary psychobabble garbage it became less than
halfway through.
