Fight Club is one of those movies that starts kind of slow, but with each
frame the speed goes in crecendo, so when half the movie is past, the
narration got such amount of momentum, that you can&acute;t stop watching it until
it blows you at the end, getting you mind dumb for a couple of minutes
thinking what just happened.<br /><br />The story line is simple, a man that doesn&acute;t like his life the way it is,
starts searching for new kicks. In the middle of this search he meets a
unique person, the Carpe Diem Carpe Noctem spirit, that makes him part of a
club, the fight club. At this point is when the movie starts its rampage
speed. In the Fight Club everyone is welcome, everyone that is not satisfied
with his life or the status quo of society, but for there surprise they are
not a minority, the rest you must see it for your self.<br /><br />Brat Pit performance in this movie is just great, just as great as his
characters in Seven, 12 Monkeys or Snatch (please erase from your memories
his acting in the Mexican); Eduard Norton is also great; the both of them
makes a great lead duo.<br /><br />To fully understand and enjoy the movie, you must have an open mind and be
aware of all the cultural references you would see in this movie, from
beatnik expressions to the most consumpcionist neo yuppie ones.<br /><br />To wrap this up, is one of the best movies I&acute;ve ever seen it got a
surprising ending (just like usual suspects), a lot of action and fights
(like a High quality Bronson/Van Damme movie), and a great and original
script (like American Beauty) for me this is a new Classical film, it gets 9
and a half stars from 10.
