This film really exceeded my expectations. As well as being well acted,
with
a great script and storyline, it's got a good sense of humour and doesn't
take itself too seriously. Perhaps because of this, the serious bits
really
have a lot of impact. It's a film that men and women will probably enjoy
equally, which is too rare in my opinion. Brad Pitt proves again that he's
not just a pretty face, and Edward Norton's performance is great. I even
managed to get over my usual hatred of Helena Bonham Carter! Far far
better
than American Psycho, which has some similarities.
