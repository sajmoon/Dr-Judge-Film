&quot;Fight Club&quot; is pure genius, it represents everything &quot;we&quot; (society, not
me
personally) despise; which is exactly what it asks for and deserves.  If
&quot;A
Clockwork Orange&quot; is considered a masterpiece against violence in movies
by
some, and a mere piece of trash by others, then &quot;Fight Club&quot; is just pure
education at it's best.  Tyler Durden is the prophet of our times, whether
it be spiritually or physically or mentally.  If you don't agree than
refer
to lines 16-18 of this review.  This film is excellent.  It creates an
environment which is only appreciated by those who appreciate it (sound
stupid?) for example:  The trailer, by giving the impression of pure and
utter violence, breaks through the scarred psyche of a TRULY intelligent
person, sparking an interest.  While it keeps the hypocrites and &quot;fashion
drones&quot; of our society away.  While the intelligent people ,i.e. the
people
who are smart enough to look into it, go and see the film and realize it's
intellectual significance; the hypocrites and drones mock and criticize
it's
threat to our external culture of &quot;love&quot; and a so-called religious
renaissance. Ha!. &quot;Fight Club&quot; repels the people IT criticizes, who are
continuously looking for insight and &quot;wisdom&quot; on the latest trends in
fashion and music, and draws the people who are continuously looking for
insight and wisdom that truly applies to us.  &quot;Fight Club&quot; IS what it is.
It
is not TRL, it is not Gap, it is  not the GOP, it is not Volkswagen, it is
not Fubu, it is not Macintosh, it is not Juvenile (yes everyone's fav
rapper, oooh), it is not Old Navy, it is not *NSYNC, it is not the
Backstreet Boys, IT IS NOT Pop Culture...&quot;I reject the basic assumption of
modern society, especially the importance of material possessions!&quot;
Simply
put Tyler.
