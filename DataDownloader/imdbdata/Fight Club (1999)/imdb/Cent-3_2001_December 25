A person as enthralled with Fight Club as myself could write several pages
on how terrific this film was.  The ideas presented in this work are not
just some testosterone induced fantasy - they are very real prospects
presented via rather radical means.  Our world is in trouble today, and
Fight Club does an astounding job of shedding light on these issues.  The
acting, the dialogue, the direction, they were all fantastic.  The action
was good, but it is not what made this movie what it was - the brains behind
the story are what bring it up into the shining light that is good film
production.  If any of you reading this are all happy about the BMW you
drive, the Armani you wear, or the four story mansion you live in, see Fight
Club and learn a lesson.  This movie was made for you whether you enjoy it
or not.
