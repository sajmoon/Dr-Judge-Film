my father once said as a joke,&quot;just because i don't know and don't care,
doesn't mean i'm stupid and apathetic.&quot;<br /><br />he never spoke truer words. tyler durden never spoke truer
words.<br /><br />our forefathers had the american revolution, our great-grand fathers had
the
civil war, our grand-fathers had the world wars, our fathers had the cold
wars. what do we have? computers and beepers, mortgages and jobs we hate.
between the false love-you c**p of the 70's, the false love-me c**p of the
80's, and the false cyber-cerebral c**p of the 90's; we've separated
each other not only from society but from ourselves. we're disgruntled
americans with nothing to fight against except ourselves. we will finally
destroy ourselves with extreme sports, extreme toys, and jobs that give us
extreme ulcers.<br /><br />tyler's voice is extreme, his methods are extreme, his reality is extreme,
his point his extreme.<br /><br />gen-x is getting an extreme wake up call - and fight club is
it.
