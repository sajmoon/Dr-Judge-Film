Bravo for Fight Club.  This movie, backed by an excellent novel, was the
perfect glimpse into the psyche of all Americans.  I think everyone can
relate to something about Edward Norton's character.  Many people may think
this movie is about fighting and testosterone, but that is just an
overlying
plot element that rather cleverly disguises the true meaning of the film.
Every person has things they wish they were, and everyone has a breaking
point.  This film is about how the narrator manifests his.  I would
recommend this film for anyone, especially the Brad Pitt or David Fincher
fan.  These two make magic together.
