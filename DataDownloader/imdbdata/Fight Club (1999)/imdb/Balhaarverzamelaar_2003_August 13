When I first encountered the title of this movie, I immediately thought
of
an action movie with a not-at-all-thought-out plot or story, maybe good
for
a friday night on the cough with a crate of beer. For this reason I never
thought of renting this movie, let alone buying it. It is also because of
this reason that when I eventually did see the movie, I was
amazed...<br /><br />The story, the music, the perfect acting of Norton and Pitt, the action,
the
twist the philosophical and psychological ideas behind the surface...
It's
not only all there, it's also all in the right place. It became one of my
all-time favourites right after the end of the movie (with the great end
music of the Pixies) and is a must-see for everyone.
