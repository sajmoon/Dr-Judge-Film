Here's an idea.  Write a movie that explores the idea of a pawn in society
turning to anarchist ideals.  Have the transformation happen in a unique
setting.  Take the idea to extremes.  Throw in some unredeemed violence to
give it that authentic gutter feel of anarchism.<br /><br />Okay, now you have the plot of a pretty decent movie.  Oh, wait, though.
We
should add a plot twist.  Hmmmm, but the twist will cause some of our
scenes
to make no sense.  Oh well, most of the movie is already printed, lets
just
finish it and call the loose ends artistic license.<br /><br />The only problem is the twist pretty much ruins the movie.  Oh sure, it
makes you rethink the early parts, and adds a clever uncertainty to the
original experience, but the twist just doesn't hold up.  How can many of
the earlier scenes be plausibly explained?  The final scenes of the movie
just let the air out of the whole plot (the twist didn't work in my mind,
and the final sixty seconds made me think that the writers couldn't figure
out how to finish off the movie).<br /><br />Good acting by Ed Norton and Helena Bonham Carter.  Brad Pitt has done
this
same character before in Twelve Monkeys.<br /><br />Compare this movie to momento, however, and you'll find that momento
manages
to pack in a much more devilish twist that makes you rethink the whole
experience and doesn't leave you saying &quot;but hold on a second, how could
that other scene have happened&quot;?
