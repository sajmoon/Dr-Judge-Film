Well, first of all I think this was an amazing movie, yes the end is kind
of
trip , but I think its pretty original and interesting. The film is filled
with social satire, and dark humor.Second I love and hate tyler durden. He
has so many good points, specially about society in the modern era, but he
ends up just being a hypocrite, he doesnt want to &quot;free&quot; mankind, he wants
to be the leader of his cult, a god to all those who want to follow him.
Also I dont think this movie promotes violence, the fights show you the
true
brutality of fighting, and &quot;Fight Club &quot; is nothing more than Tyler's
little
game to gain control over people.
Last but not least, whether you hate or love this movie, realize one
thing,
at the very least,I makes you think,
Think for youre self, dont let an IKEA catalog do that for you, or even
tyler durden, or even me.
