2000_February 7 

I would like to clear up some facts about my favorite film.  The film is
great in every way.  Contrary to some previous reviews, the ending to Fight
Club proves that &quot;It is only when you have hit bottom that you can begin to
succeed.&quot;  Narrator hit bottom...in the end he grew to be a better person. 
This film is not about eternal torture or dreary failure.  No, no, NO!  This
film is about motivating YOURSELF to be successful.  But, in this film,
success is in the eye of the beholder.  The end to this masterpiece proved
that in Narrator's supposed &quot;crazy&quot; state, where he is &quot;obviously&quot; insane,
he comes out successful and does not need Tyler's wisdom to propel himself
to a higher state of knowledge.  Tyler looked like a villain who terrorized
Narrator...BUT...you have to take in mind that the theme of this film is
success through self-destruction i.e. negative inspiration.  So, this film
is a success in every way.  And, WHEN this film is forgotten in the future
as opposed to A Clockwork Orange being praised just remember: the soul of
this film is corruption among hypocrites i.e. SOCIETY.  Who rates
movies...SOCIETY.  Who praises movies...SOCIETY.  Who spurns
movies...SOCIETY.  This film will not be regarded as great by society until
society lives up to Tyler Durden's standards which is far
off.
