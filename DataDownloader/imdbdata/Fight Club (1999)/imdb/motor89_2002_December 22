Ok, the idea that men are becoming emasculated and dehumanised by a
society
that is increasingly women-oriented (shoppers, not hunters) is not new...
nor is it particularly insightful. Fight Club, though, manages to take
the
idea and spin it into an amazing visual and philosophical kick in the
teeth.<br /><br />I've seen reviews calling the film sexist because it has no women
characters
in it, apart from Marla and she is hardly a good example of womenhood.
Who
cares? Not every film has to slavishly follow the PC line and include the
requisite tough female. This is a film about men; their problems; their
neuroses (and psychoses), and a particularly brutal way of putting into
perspective the crap that, as men, they have to take every single day.
And
it is not as if the film is flattering to men -- Fight Club moves from
being
a way for the men to regain their individuality, and turns it into a cult
before pulling the rug out from under the viewer completely with the
twist.
It's a brutal satire on everything from the junk peddled as culture in
the
West, to the absurd self-help/inner-child nonsense filling our
televisions
(adverts and programmes), to ridiculous hyper-macho behaviour.<br /><br />As a film, Fight Club is a violent masterpiece with a lot of similarities
to
A Clockwork Orange, not least of which is the outrage it caused in
certain
over-sensitive reviewers. Watch it and enjoy the visceral (damn I wanted
to
avoid that word) show... watch it again for directorial flare from David
Fincher... and then again for fine acting by both Norton and Pitt. It's
excellent the first time you see it, and it just keeps getting better --
and
that's the sign of a truly great film.<br /><br />Go out and start a fight? Me? Nah... but Fight Club served as a reminder
that I'm not just a consumer; a statistic, or a demographic.
