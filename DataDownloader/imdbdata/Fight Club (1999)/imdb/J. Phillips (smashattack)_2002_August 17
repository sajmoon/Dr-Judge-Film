I am back for my second review of Fight Club.  Why, you ask?  Because I was
told I had an &quot;inadequate&quot; amount of evidence to prove my point!  So here I
go.<br /><br />Fight Club is a very strange, erratic movie that, quite honestly, nearly put
me to sleep within the first ten minutes.  It seemed that the whole movie
revolved around an insomniac!  And that's true--this movie is about nothing
but a guy who can't sleep.  For over half of it seems to be the very first
movie that has no plot, no decent characters (what kind of main character is
known only as &quot;The Narrator&quot;?), and a crummy soundtrack.  I was SO
disappointed.<br /><br />&quot;Plot Outline: A man disillusioned by what his life has become encounters an
exciting stranger who introduces him to a new way of life.&quot;<br /><br />Well, yeah, that's all fine and dandy, but this new way of life doesn't come
in until WAY later.  And once Fight Club is finally introduced, it is hardly
shown.  Then it turns into a macho group of terrorists... I'm sorry, but how
utterly boring!  From the commercials and video cover, I was expecting there
to be a plot that revolved around the Fight Club.  Instead, I was slapped in
the face with this stupid terrorist group that doesn't serve a
purpose.<br /><br />I now have to go to Helena Bonham Carter.  Hey, lady, you did excellent in
Planet of the Apes!  But in this movie she plays as a rival counseling group
member (speaking of which, what purpose do these groups serve for the movie?
 NOTHING!).  Basically, her character is a slut and we see her naked once or
twice (ooh, yeah, maybe THAT'S why everyone liked the movie!).<br /><br />The final conflict, in which The Narrator (boy, that name is just so cool)
is fighting &quot;himself&quot;, is utterly pathetic.  How boring.  And then the
buildings topple... and that's the end.  Ho!  Wait!  I see a naked man from
the waist down at the ending!  Maybe this is the second reason people liked
this stupid, boring movie so much.  It shows both female AND male
anatomy.<br /><br />How stupid!  Repulsive!  I DESPISED this movie.  Now you know why.  If, in
fact, you STILL don't understand, listen closely:<br /><br />1.  Boring
2.  No plot (adds to number 1)
3.  Shallow characters
4.  Actual film has hardly anything to do with its title
5.  Constant swearing/nudity that sickened me
6.  Music was cruddy<br /><br />Basically, this film reeked of anything but stupidity.  I was so sick of it
before the first half hour was up.<br /><br />I will never watch it again.  And I hope my review will help keep you from
watching it as well.
