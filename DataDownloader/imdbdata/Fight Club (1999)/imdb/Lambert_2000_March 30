In the company of my brother and a friend we started to watch this film. The
friend left, bored, and went to bed. My brother fell asleep. I barely
managed keep my eyes open and see it through. We must've missed something,
considering the raving reviews of other users... or maybe we were just very
tired.<br /><br />
