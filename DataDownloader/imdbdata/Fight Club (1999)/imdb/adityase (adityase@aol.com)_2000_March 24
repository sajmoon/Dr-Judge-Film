I have finally seen Fight Club and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  I'm still
hesitant to lionize the movie as &quot;great&quot; because I have not fully
understood
what I believe the film ultimately says.  By ultimately I mean at the end
(which I'm surprised so many people simply wrote off as disappointing
without, I fear, further examination).  I'm most compelled at this time,
however, to comment on the reactions to the movie by many critics as &quot;too
violent&quot;.  --  The movie is called FIGHT Club.  That's for starters.
Additionally, the violence is a crucial part of the story.  It is not
gratuitous, nor is it glorified.  Contextually, I don't see how it can be
deemed problematic.  As for its place in society as a potential powder-keg
for violence in youths?  Don't you think the film addresses this problem
as
well?  Perhaps the youths shouldn't be so quick to consume the images of a
corporate enterprise.    Violence???  For crying out loud, you'd think
these
critics had never seen the evening news????
