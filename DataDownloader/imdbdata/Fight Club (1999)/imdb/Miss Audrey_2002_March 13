I know the first rule, but some are made to be broken.  This movie
showcases
the thoughts that pulse through every human mind and are never acted upon
due to the weakness and unmotivatedness that is programmed into the brain
from birth.  It is inspiring, not to involve oneself in violence and
mayhem,
but just to think of what all there is it what it might not actually be.
Taking things from the perspective of Tyler is a road every man and woman
should take at least once.
