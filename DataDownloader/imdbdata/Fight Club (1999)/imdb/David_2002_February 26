Fight Club, the best movie I've ever seen. Baised on all the movies that
I've seen, this one gets into all the good areas of filming. The stunts
were
amazing, makeup some of the best. Overall plot is just astounding, and
replay value... I know I've seen it more than 50 times. You keep learning
in
this film, either more about the characters, to understand the film more,
or
you learn about yourself. The best movie I've seen. &quot;You are not the
contents of your walet&quot;-Tyler Durden.
