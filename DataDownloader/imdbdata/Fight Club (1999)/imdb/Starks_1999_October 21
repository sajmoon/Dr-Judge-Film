Fight Club is not at all what I expected it to be.  I was thinking that it
was a look inside a secret world of amateur ultimate fighting, an action
film with the top notch stars like Pitt, Norton and Bonham Carter.  Boy was
I wrong.  Fight Club is so much more involved and intricate than that.  It
is a statement about American consumerism and one man's attempt break away
from Ikea catalogs and triple chai lattes.  What American Beauty does for
the suburbs, Fight Club does for this materialistic society we live in.  The
story is interesting but what really makes this film is the director and the
effort he put into it.  This film had some scenes and shots that had me
scratching my head saying how did he do that.  There are some really neat
things here.  I would recommend this movie (unless you get grossed out
easily)
