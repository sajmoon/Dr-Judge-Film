Ok, so the plot may have a couple of holes, but so what? The way I see it ,
this is a hymn to human potential, the power within every one of us that
some times is so well hidden, the existence of which even WE cannot
realize,
let alone handle and use. Maybe we won't get to discover it the extreme way
the main character does, yet we can sit down and think after watching this
film about how much (or little) we can relate to him. And this is just one
parameter of the film to analyze. In a movie that gives you so much to
think
about, a few faults here and there can be overlooked. Also, with this
movie,
Norton proves that he's probably the best actor of his generation. 8
