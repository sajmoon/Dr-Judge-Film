I belive that this is a film that speaks out against anarchy. Yet to a large
portion of this films audience, teenagers, it does not get that message
across. Most high-schoolers leave this film only remembering the insane
ramblings of the god-like Brad Pitt character Tyler Durden. In that sense,
this film contradicts itself. Also, I did not find this film enjoyable. Not
the first time a watched it, not the second time and not the third time.
Sure, I laughed a couple times and some of the fight scenes were cool, but
those aspects did not make up for this cluttered picture. Plus the CG
cinematography was very out of place, as it is in Fincher's superior piece,
PANIC ROOM.
