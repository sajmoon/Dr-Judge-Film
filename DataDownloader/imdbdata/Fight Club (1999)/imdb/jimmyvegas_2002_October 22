Fight Club is without a doubt one of the most amazing movies I have ever
seen, speaking to the gen-x'ers in much the same way &quot;The Graduate&quot; spoke
to
the spawn of the 50's generation (albeit in a far more over-the-top
scenario). From the entertaining visual trickery, to the awesome
performances by Pitt and Norton, to the killer twist ending, this film
speaks to the viewer on every conceivable level. It's powerful, funny, and
action-packed.... and above all, unlike so many major studio films
released
nowadays, it forces the viewer to think. Which is perhaps the greatest
service a film can perform.
