If you think everything that you don&acute;t understand is ART, than this movie
is
for you.<br /><br />I&acute;ll cut it short: it is a very interesting intro, the second act is still
good, but the third act and especially the ending is plain
stupid.
It just doesn&acute;t work that.<br /><br />So please don&acute;t insult people who don&acute;t like that film by saying &quot;you just
don&acute;t get it&quot;. And don&acute;t come up with that &quot;it makes you think!&quot; - crap.<br /><br />If you are puzzled at the end of the movie, it doesn&acute;t mean necessarily
that
it is intellectual or philosophical, it is - in most cases and especially
in
this one - it is just bad writing/directing!<br /><br />This movie comes up with a &quot;twist&quot; you had no chance at all to see it
coming. This is cheap. And the explanation is just impossible: The author
thinks you&acute;re an idiot and hopes to get away with this. And I don&acute;t like
movies like this.<br /><br />4/10 Macaulay J. Connor
