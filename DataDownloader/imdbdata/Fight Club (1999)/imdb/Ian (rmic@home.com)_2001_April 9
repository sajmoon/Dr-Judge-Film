Fight club is noted to be filled with senseless violence, however, having
been in fights myself, there is nothing unrealistic about these brawls.
The
violence in this films makes half of the statement.<br /><br />Fight club is a movie that makes a very bold statement of modern times,
society, commercialism, and how people no longer think for themselves.
People who can not recognize this film for the genius of portraying our
modern times are stuck in exactly what this film criticizes<br /><br />The movie starts with the narrator(who remains nameless)speaking of how he
is fed up with society.  He then encounters a character tyler durden who
teaches him to start living and thinking for himself.  THe mvoie
demostrates
in very direct manners on how we as a society depend on the media and
society to dictate what we think.  A way for these men, in this case, to
break free from these barriers is to fight senselessly with each other for
no reason, to tap the pre-commercialism man and bring it out upon the
forefront of your character.<br /><br />As this goes on, the fight clubs get larger and larger, and the narrator
starts to become self centered in the sense that the fight club evolves
from
something that benefits him, to something that no longer benefits himself,
but all around him.  The film is soaked with irony  in that it demonstrates
that there are leaders and followers, and it is a part of mankind, and that
some people are inherently weaker willed and weaker minded then others, the
weaker willed and weaker minded are the folks who will not get this
film.
