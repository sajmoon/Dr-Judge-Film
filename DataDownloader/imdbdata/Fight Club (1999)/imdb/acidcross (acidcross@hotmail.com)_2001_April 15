When Fight Club was released to theatres i refused to go see it. The
previews made it look like it was movie purely about senseless violence
without a point or a message. One night while at a friends house they were
raving aobut Fight Club and someone had brought it over to watch. i wasn't
into seeing it but what else could i do. When the movie was over i couldn't
believe what i had just saw. All my negative feelings about the movie were
put to rest and i realized that i had seen a great movie and now it's in my
top 10.<br /><br />I won't go into the plot because i think that the viewer should experience
that for himself instead of reading this review. i will however say that
it's not all about violence and the violence that is displayed in the film
has a reason for being there. it's all about letting out aggression and
finding out who you are. The violence is just a small part of a bigger
picture.<br /><br />The acting is top notch. Brad pitt is in a lot of my favorite movies(Seven,
Interview with the vampire, snatch).He's a very good actor and he jsut has
a
certain charisma when he's on screen. If anyone hasany doubts about his
abilities they should see tihs movie. Edward Norton is also very good in
the
film. He's a very versatile actor and he fits intot his role very nicely.
Helen bohnam carter is very good as the sole female in the film. she can
more that handle her own with the 2 male leads. good supporting roles are
also give by meat loaf and jared leto. Meat loaf is especially good in his
role as bob.<br /><br />The direction by David Fincher is excellent. This film is a little dark
like
seven but there is more of a visual flair in this film. he's a brilant
director and he has a eye for what's good in a film.<br /><br />In closing fight club is a movie we all should see and hope everyone gets a
chance to see it.
