How could the academy overlook this movie?  If you thought the surprise
twist of Sixth Sense was groovy, you haven't seen what true craftsmanship
can do for a movie.  This is this best piece of acting, scriptwriting,
cinematography, and sound editing I've ever experienced.  Superb.  Be
prepared to watch it twice to even begin comprehending this flick.
