One of the greatest iconic movies of the 20th century. Edward Norton
and Brad Pitts finest accomplishment. Tyler Durden is one of the
greatest anarchic characters of all time. David Finchers finest and
boldest movie to date. To watch the movie is to be truly enlightened. A
bold accomplishment. One of the great movies of our generation.
Watching the movie allows the viewer to understand and truly despise
our generations refusal to open our eyes and wake up to the constant
betrayal of our own blatant greed and lack of depth in our society. The
most successful and well adapted book to movie film since Fear and
Loathing In Las Vegas.
