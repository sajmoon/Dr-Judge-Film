The critics bombed this movie sayin' 'it's disturbing and<br /><br />contains excessive violence'. But the first half hour of<br /><br />Saving Private Ryan (another masterpiece) contains twice<br /><br />more violence than this one. This is an underrated masterpiece,
deserver of many more nominations in the academy awards '99 than only
best sound effects. A solid and surprisin' screenplay for a fierce<br /><br />critic to consume society, with a modern visual style never seen before
(the computered sex scene with Marla and<br /><br />Tyler, the 1st scene, with the bomb locations, etc) and an almost
perfect cast. The best movie in the career of the excellent ex-director
of<br /><br />videoclips David Fincher (also director of another violent<br /><br />pioneer masterpiece: Se7en), and one of the best movies<br /><br />ever made. Simply spectacular.
