1999_October 23 

This is one of the best movies, maybe THE best movie I have EVER seen.  It
is a commentary on the working class's struggle to maintain sanity in a
world where corporate rule and big-whig-richies control our lives. Two men
start a new kind of men's group to cope with the demands of life and work in
general, then it become more than just an &quot;unusual&quot; social club.<br /><br />Fight Club asks you to rethink your own situation and revamp your life.  YOU
ARE NOT YOUR JOB. If you miss this movie, you will be missing out on
possibly one of the quintessential movies of the new millenium.  See Fight
Club!  Then see it again!<br /><br />kosherdave@yahoo.com
