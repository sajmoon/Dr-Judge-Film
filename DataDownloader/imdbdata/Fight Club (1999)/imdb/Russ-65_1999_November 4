1999_November 4 

Fight Club, is a great story of the psyche of a man that is so bored of his
life, he creates chaos in order to feel better. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt
do an outstanding job as the Narrator and Tyler Durden. Norton is superb in
his insanity as he loses his mind. Consoling in help groups for a good
&quot;cry&quot;. That is abruptly put to a hault by a woman who is also trying to make
her life better. Helena Bonham Carter also makes this movie what it is. The
ending spirals into a twist with one of the most shocking suprises I have
ever seen. This is one of the best films of 1999! This movie is worth the
wait and the $8.00
