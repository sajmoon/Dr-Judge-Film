and it wasn't quite what I expected, but that was okay.  The movie knocked
me out of my socks, I felt it was a well acted, well directed story that
created real interest in the characters.  Actually I was disappointed when
the movie ended, not because of the way it ended just that it did, I wanted
it to keep going.  That said there was room for improvement.  The army that
was built, and their mission seemed a bit out of place, but did match the
left field approach to life that is Tyler's existence, however it didn't
really fix.  At least not as the director showed us the story. <br /><br />I would recommend seeing this.  The blood and violence, you see it all in
the commercials, the story is left to be discovered as you watch the movie. 
My vote 8/10.  &quot;Just because you stick feathers up your butt, doesn't mean
your a chicken.&quot;
