Having watched this film, I am reassured that Brad Pitt can continue to
sneak out some excellent performances as in Twelve Monkeys, and
Se7en.<br /><br />One or two parts reminded me of Brazil, If..., and Falling Down, with the
statements about the working dead and how quickly someone can break. There
are many messages within the film, some better portrayed than others but
to
find a film this deep is so rare.<br /><br />I found the narration ok, though there seems to be a forced monotony in
Nortons voice. The film maintains the look of Finchers previous work
keeping
a definite distance from that of Hollywood blockbusters.<br /><br />Things that many people seen to find annoying, like the voice-over, I find
make the film, preventing it from attaining the slick look of many
Hollywood
productions. The film metamorphoses through several stages before
resolving
itself in a maybe disappointing ending, which leaves the viewer thinking
the
film should have been either shorter or longer. I found the plot twist
well
incorporated with enough clues to let the observant viewer see it coming
but
without making it obvious.<br /><br />A powerful film with several strong messages, delivered excellently by a
great cast. Most people that don't like this film, either don't understand
the messages, refuse to accept the messages, or are expecting something
more
mainstream. The violence, while strong, is never gratuitous and always
strengthens the film.<br /><br />Maybe a slightly confused film, but most definitely worth viewing. Now a
personal favourite of mine along with Twelve Monkeys.
