Was the title of this review grammatically correct? Who cares? I don&#x27;t
give a damn like tyler durden. Just finished watching the movie and I
am so excited as to write down this review that I cannot express in
words.<br /><br />Fight Club is not your typical action fare full of car&#x27;s smashing,
bullets launching, and characters dying. It is neither a psychological
thriller in the real sense. And I don&#x27;t think it can fit into any genre
for that case. Well, it is mind-blowing movie is all I can say. And I
have seldom watched movie as intelligent as the fight club.<br /><br />Edward Norton, a guy who is nameless, suffering with Insomnia, lacks
excitement in life. Numerous things he tries, but nothing to any avail.
But, one day he meets Tyler Durden, a dare-devil, and brilliantly
different person. And then they start a Fight club. A club where people
fight each other. This changes his life. Slowly the fight club goes
popular and more and more people join until it becomes a significant
organization. The first project of the club is &#x27;Project Mayhem&#x27;. But
Tyler keeps the narrator(edward norton) ignorant of the development of
the project, and one day leaves him. Why has tyler left his friend with
whom he created Fight Club.<br /><br />The first rule of the fight club &#x22;Go watch it twice&#x22; and the second
rule is &#x22;Go watch it twice&#x22;...
