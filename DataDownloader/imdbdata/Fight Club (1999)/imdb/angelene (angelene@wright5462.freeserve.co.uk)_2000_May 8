This has to be about the best movie out in the last year or so. It was
absolutely fascinating. It was really witty and very funny as well making
an
incisive comment on society today. What it said about the role and problems
of men in todays world were most thought-provoking.<br /><br />I had been quite prepared not to like the movie after many most
unfavourable
reviews which would lead one to expect the violence to be most offensive.
But this was not the case. The violence was quite subsidiary in many ways.
It was only  used to support the main premise of the story - that men are
cut off from real feeling by the life that we all lead today.<br /><br />We have been encouraged to believe that men and women should have no
differences. This is plainly ludicrous but society and education have built
up this myth. Men have been undermined from their natural role and in this
been emasculated. This really comes over in the film. Wonderful  -  all
this
and Brad Pitt too!! - too much!!
