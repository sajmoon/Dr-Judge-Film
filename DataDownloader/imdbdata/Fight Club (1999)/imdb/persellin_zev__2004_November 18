I love this movie, it gives a new generation an unbaised look into
communism (even you oldies too) Think about it..Bard Pit: &quot;The things
you own begin to own you&quot; like this is half of what Karl Marx was
talking about. Then they make a COMMUNE where all the people live and
there is no individualism there is only the whole..Did everyone miss
this??? Not only that!!!! WHAT EXACTLY WHERE THEY REBELLING AGAINST!!!
The freaking credit card companies, the slavers of the average man.
OTHERWISE CAPITALISM..NOT TO MENTION Brad Pitt saying: We are your
waiters your garbage men etc etc..Basically the working middle
class..Exactly what class the communist revolution was for! There is
very very little difference from the club created in this movie, and
communist Russia. Now comes the million dollar question: Did the fight
club appeal to you? Would you do the same thing those people did? Think
about it, and now what do you think about communism?
