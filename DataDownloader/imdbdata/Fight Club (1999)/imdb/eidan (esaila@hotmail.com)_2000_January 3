This is the kind of movie that today's people need to awake from that
dream
that has become the status quo.<br /><br />The actuation of Mr. Norton is superb, and the characters are one of the
best samples of what we can become in todays' more and more boring and
useless (in the sense of real inner satisfaction)life.
