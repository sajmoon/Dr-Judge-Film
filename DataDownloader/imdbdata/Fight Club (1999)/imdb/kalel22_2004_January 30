When Fight Club first came out in 1999 I wasn't sure that I would be
impressed with the film. Brad Pitt was OK and I wasn't really sure who
Edward Norton was. Regardless I purchased my ticket and went to see the
movie not knowing how much this film would impact my cinematic view. I
left the theater with one of the weirdest feelings I have ever felt
towards a film. The way it just was, the way it deeply explored the
male psyche through such physical and mental turmoil. <br /><br />In my opinion, Fight Club is an excellent cornerstone in cinema
history. It's gritty, dark, and bitter sweet. To me, it's the one film
that all other films afterwords will be compared to. I think it will be
a movie remembered as one of the great films of our time; perhaps not
&quot;Schindlers List&quot; or &quot;Forest Gump&quot; great, but much better, more like &quot;A
Clock Work Orange&quot;. <br /><br />Previous Generations won't try to understand it, and future generations
will view it as a &quot;Classic&quot;, but only for it's hype. It's one of the
movies that I truly feel belongs to us, and what a movie to own.
