It's a shame that Fight Club premiered shortly after the various shootings
in American High Schools, and therefore received a lot of criticism for its
violence. many critics were afraid to praise the movie or maybe didn't care
to dwell beneath the exterior casing of this film. And that's a shame,
because Fight is, and should be, the landmark movie of the generation
X'ers.
The movie is a cry out against consumerism, and promotes self-destruction
as
a way to rebuild you life. A life without the slavery of material and
commodities. Fight Club offers a hole new way to think, and is
provoking.<br /><br />Jack (Edward Norton) is an average American guy, working a job he hates,
trying desperately to fit the description of the ideal nineties single
successful male. He has his Ikea furniture and other import necessities to
fill the void where his existence as a happy man is questionable. Then he
meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Tyler turns Jacks life upside down and
introduces Jack to his life philosophy: It is only after you have lost
everything, that you are free to do anything. Tyler believes in physical
pain as a mean to break down the illusions modern day society has brought
upon us. Fight Club is started.<br /><br />Edward Norton gives his best performance ever in this film, and Brad Pitts
interpretation of Tyler is brilliant! Also great performances by Helena
Bonham Carter as Marla Singer and Jared Leto as Angel Face.
Also this movie is perfectly directed by David Fincher (Seven, The Game,
Panic Room), and has one of the best plot twists ever seen on film. This
movie may well be the most important film of the nineties.
