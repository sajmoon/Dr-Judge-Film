2000_June 7 

I've seen a couple of people use similar lines in their comments. DID THEY
EVEN WATCH THE MOVIE? The actual fight scenes make up about 3% of the
entire
film! Jeez.<br /><br />Anyway... my thoughts:<br /><br />I have to admit, when I saw the trailers last year, they did NOTHING to
make
me want to see the movie. It looked to me like it was going to be some
kind
of &quot;heist gone wrong&quot; flick. You know, like Killing Zoe, or Dog Day
Afternoon. It wasn't until a couple of months ago when a friend clued me
in
to the fact that there's much more going on in Fight Club than the
trailers
allude to. And so, I made up my mind that I'd pick up the DVD as soon as
it
was out. Well, today is the day. It's out.<br /><br />I would say that, yes, this is a &quot;guy flick&quot;. It seems to be aimed at guys
(i.e. males 18-50 or whatever), or women who are really fascinated with
men,
interested in what makes us tick and whatnot. I don't see it as a
manifesto,
of course. But I do think it's meant to bring up some pointed questions
about what we &quot;guys&quot; are in 2000 A.D. And what we should be. And what we
want to be. All I know is, I'm a guy, and this movie entertained me,
shocked
me, horrified me, and gave me something to think about. All in all, one of
the best movies I've seen recently. It's up there with Boys Don't Cry
and...
um... The Dark Crystal!
