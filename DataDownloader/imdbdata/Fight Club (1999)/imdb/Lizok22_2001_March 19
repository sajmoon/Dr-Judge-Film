When this movie came out, I had no desire at all to see it.  The
commercials
portrayed the movie as something like a modern underground boxing ring.
All
the reviewers could talk about was how shamelessly violent it was. By
letting myself fall victim to bad publicity, I missed out seeing this movie
on the big screen.
Where was the marketing for this movie, I ask you?<br /><br />This movie was terrific.  An incredible social commentary of our time
period.  Makes us question our daily values and routines.  Makes us...
well,
look at Brad Pitt in a whole new light!  He gave one of the best
performances I've seen in his career.  Of course, Edward Norton was
incredible, his dry wit and knowing narration are a key component
here.
A very pleasant surprise for a doubting Thomas here!
