Fight Club is, most definitely, one of the best films of the '90s and a very
entertaining, quirky psychological study. The plot is certainly ingenious,
and David Fincher constructs the film in a quirky and interesting way. Not
to mention Brad Pitt and Ed Norton have credible chemistry in this film. The
story keeps twisting and turning in a downward spiral but nothing prepares
you for the twist in the end. Everything works well in this movie, the
performances are fun (Helena Bonham Carter is great in her role) and the
direction is well-handled. The manner in which the story is told is very
reminiscent of a Danny Boyle movie, a la Trainspotting, etc. it works
perfectly here, and that ending! All in all, I would have to say that
although it is quite a brutal film at times, Fight Club is one of the most
impressive and original films of the '90s and definitely one of the best of
the year.
