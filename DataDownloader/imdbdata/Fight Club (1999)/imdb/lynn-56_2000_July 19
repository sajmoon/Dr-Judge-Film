I just saw this movie for the first time because someone said it had  a plot
&quot;twist.&quot;  What I got was alot more.  I should also say I'm an over 40
Christian female and, no, I don't condone violence, nihilism, porno, etc.,
blah, blah, blah.  But I can say I loved this movie and watched it as many
times in the 5-day rental period as I could stand.  Besides, the violence
meant something.  It wasn't about killing.  I learned to love Marla and see
her not as a &quot;fringe person&quot; but as a woman yanked around by the crazy guy
she fell for.  Brad Pitt absolutely snarled as Tyler and could be seen as
the &quot;anti-femme&quot; fatale in this noirish nightmare.  Ultimately, I think the
reason I love it so much is, aside from the great acting and ambiance, I
identified with the narrator and felt the film was basically about his
psychological redemption.  Who knows what other kind would have followed?  I
can't wait for the sequel!
