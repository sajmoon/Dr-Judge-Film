Fight Club is an extremely intriguing movie, one which will captivate you
beyond your furthest imagination. It touches base on topics which you
encounter every day of your life, proclaiming statements like `My life
sucks' and so on. That's why it is such a great movie, you can relate. Also
it provides ideas so extreme yet so plausible that you would actually
consider doing so, if of course you were more radical.<br /><br />Also this movie leads to such an incredible climax you will end the movie
with your jaw dropped. It is something so unpredictable that you won't be
able to predict it no matter how hard you try unless you have seen the movie
before. <br /><br />Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, both great actors of course, provided nothing
short of a great performance in this movie. Also the fighting in this movie
was very well performed, very believable. Very good job on make-up's part;
looked very real. <br /><br />This is one of those movies that has to be on everyone's must see list, if
you haven't seen this movie and you plan on telling someone that you haven't
you are guaranteed a reaction similar to `WHAT!?!?' <br /><br />Very good movie, what else can I say.
