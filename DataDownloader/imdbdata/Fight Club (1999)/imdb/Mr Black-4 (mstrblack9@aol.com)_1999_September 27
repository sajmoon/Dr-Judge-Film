1999_September 27 

I bought the novel and 24 hours later, it was finished. I read
the first chapter five times before moving on. With David
Fincher directing this dark and bizarre tale, and Ed Norton and
Brad Pitt in their respective roles of the Narrator and Tyler
Durden, there is no way this movie cannot completely rock. To
keep with the rules, I won't talk about Fight Club any more....
