This film was entirely overlooked at the Oscars and Golden
Globes...although
it had incredible competition that year.  However, in my opinion, this was
one of the best movies of 1999 and the 90s in general.  Pitt and Norton
could have easily been contenders for either award, and the film itself
could have been up for best picture.<br /><br />
