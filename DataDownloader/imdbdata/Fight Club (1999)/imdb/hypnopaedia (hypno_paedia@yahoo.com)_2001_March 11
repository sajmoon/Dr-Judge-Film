Violence?  Essentially none compared to Saving Private Ryan,
Gladiator
and many other recent films.  Critics see an opportunity to jump
all
over this movie for its violence when in fact it is it's various
themes,
which threaten the establishment, that are the problem to them. 
People
are not used to Hollywood putting out a movie that reflects society
and
its various members' feelings, they are uncomfortable with that. 
And
they usually do a good job of stopping these kinds of films from
being
made.  They would rather a happy, repetitive and empty film than
an
honest one.  But there is a segment of the population that looks for
the
original and different film.<br /><br />This film is mocking society and it's pretty sad the length it has to
go
to do this.  Getting beaten to a pulp is the last resort to life
that
Jack sees in this early twenty-first century age.  Society says
we
should graduate from high school, go to college, get a well-paying
job,
get married, then have kids, but something seems to be missing to
Jack
while in the job stage of life, he is emotionally empty, numb and to
top
that off he has insomnia.  So to get some emotional feeling and
contact
and to possibly get some sleep, he attends support groups where
each
group has a different illness, which Jack has none of, but goes for
a
shot at life, an opportunity to live.  Now it is true that Jack
isn't
suffering with the various cancers within each group but
nonetheless
Jack is suffering.  Jack is suffering from insomnia, he's confused
and
he's unhappy.  So to treat these ailments he attends the support
groups.
So along with the other support group-goers Jack is attempting to
heal
a problem.  After a few months he sees a fellow &quot;tourist&quot; named
Marla
who goes to the support groups and also has none of the illnesses. 
So
now Jack is again unable to sleep, so he tells Marla his problem
and
from then on they agree to attend different support groups.<br /><br />Fight Club is great in so many ways.  For example: this was one of
the
first movies to use photogrammetry, which is the shots you see
going
through the building floors then into the van with the bomb in it. 
The
cool sex scene in the movie is also done by the use of
photogrammetry.
Photogrammetry was also used for the footage of the apartment
blowing
up: zooming into the stove and into the back of the refrigerator. 
Fight
Club definitely has the most original story of at least the past
couple
of years; the protagonist's real name is never given; that's
different
and interesting.  This movie challenges everything about
current-day
society: whether it is corporate influence, or modern living, or being
a
sheep in a herd, or any of the other subjects that are addressed in
the
film.  This movie ends with a great song too, &quot;Where Is My Mind?&quot; by
the
Pixies, appropriate title too.  The intro into the film is amazing
as
well - the brain ride.  The music compliments the movie so well and
fits
in great with the whole modern-day age theme.<br /><br />For the people who are uncomfortable with Fight Club and people who
find
it offensive.  These people obviously have problems of their own
that
need to be addressed.  As Edward Norton said, &quot;Art reflects the flaws
of
society&quot; and if people are uncomfortable with this then they are
the
problem.  These people are perfectly comfortable with a movie
like
Saving Private Ryan that shows limbs flying off, faces ripped
off,
torsos blown off, etc. but they can't handle a fist to an eye. And
it's
a willing fist to an eye, both fighters realize they are going to
get
hit and they want that.  Whereas in Saving Private Ryan the
people
getting shot do not want to get hit, there is a difference.  It
just
shows the contradictory views that these conservatives hold,
totally
partial to one thing over another.  What decides what type of
bloodshed
is acceptable?  The answer is what the bloodshed is representing
(what
that particular movie is about).  In the case of Saving Private Ryan
it
was patriotic bloodshed, non-threatening bloodshed, acceptable
bloodshed, but in Fight Club the bloodshed was part of a type
of
radicalism that was deemed a threat by the establishment whether it
be
Hollywood, the corporations, or the government.  That is
where
censorship comes in, the free flowing of ideas, which is
completely
necessary for a healthy democracy.  When censors start to flex
their
muscle that's when some form of communism or fascism makes
its
appearance.  With one critic calling Fight Club fascist, I say
censoring
an idea is fascist (an example most obvious in the case of Brazil
where
Terry Gilliam almost could not get the movie released).  If you
don't
like Fight Club or the ideas it presents then don't watch it, but
don't
decide for others if it is acceptable to watch or not.<br /><br />A few insights that I gained: the car company that Jack worked for
is
Ford Motor Company.  This is shown in the scene when Jack beats
himself
up in front of his boss and they quickly show a glimpse of the
letters
&quot;FMC&quot; on his boss's business card, which would refer to Ford
Motor
Company.  Jack got over his TV addiction that he and so many
Americans
have.  This shows that to live you have to lose that addiction. 
Upon
reflecting, Tyler is so free in the ways that most (and almost
all
people) aren't.  Tyler doesn't have a car, doesn't have bills,
doesn't
have pointless possessions, he doesn't work everyday to pay for his
new
$25,000 car, he's free.  The rejection of material possessions is
one
important idea to take away from the film, if nothing else.
