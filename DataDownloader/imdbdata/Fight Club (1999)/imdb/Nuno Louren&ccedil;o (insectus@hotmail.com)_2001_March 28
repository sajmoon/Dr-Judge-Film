This is not a movie. It is an experience. When I first heard of it I just
imagined it would be just another action packed brain less flick, until I
realized the director was David Fincher. That was the reason I saw it. As
I
saw the movie I felt something that I had never felt when watching a
movie:
I felt that it could be a critic to my own life. The film is a critic to
today's emotion less society, where all is single serving and where
vacuum
cleaners are worth more than human lives. Some may say that it may
influence
negatively people, in my opinion its a wake up call, a serious one. I
wont
comment on the excellent performances by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, on
the
flawless direction by Fincher and on the extraordinary script, I will
just
say: WATCH THIS MOVIE because you might be asleep and don't even know it.
On
a more technical note, I think this movie proves that visual effects have
a
space on movies not as fireworks but as narrative tools, you will know
what
I mean when you watch it.
