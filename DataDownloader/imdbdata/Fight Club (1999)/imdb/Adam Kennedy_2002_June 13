Fantastic movie, but you, dear reader, should check out the book.  A lot
darker, more depraved, more desperate, everything that made the movie
great
is amplified in the book with a different ending that is superior to the
Hollywood ending of the film.  Also check out Survivor and Choke by Chuck
Palahniuk, I'm having a bit of trouble getting into Invisible Monster.
