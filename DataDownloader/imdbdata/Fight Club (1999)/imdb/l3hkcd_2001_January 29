fight club is one of those movies i like writing review for, because it can
be summed up very easily and quickly. In this case, it is a technically
superior and intellectually empty movie. it repeatedly pummels the audience
with its main message - consumerism is bad; you should choose for your own
life; be an individual without blindly following other people bla bla. tell
us something new please. wrap all these extremely clich&eacute;d messages in some
fancy camera work and MTV-style storytelling and you have fight club.
overall this movie gives the impression of coming from the hands of a
skillful yet immature teenager. An average movie.
