Yes the Movie has gave me an influence... but I feel the need to
announce that for the past 4 Months we have held our own &quot;Fight Club&quot;
and our rules are as follows:<br /><br />1. You do not talk about Fight Club. 2. You DO NOT talk about Fight
Club. 3. If someone says &quot;stop&quot; or goes limp, taps out the fight IS
over. 4. Only two guys to a fight. 5. One fight at a time. 6. No shoes,
No Shirts 7. Fights will go on AS LONG AS they have to 8. NO Facial
Shots, below head only, that includes NO &quot;below the belt&quot; Shots aka
&quot;Privates&quot;. 9. If this is your first night at Fight Club, you HAVE to
fight.<br /><br />Interested? Reply ;)
