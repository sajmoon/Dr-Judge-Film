I have been told to watch this one a thousand times, so I followed the film
as carefully as I could. It did keep me interested in the first half, in
fact it was more like I forced myself to watch the 1st half, because the
same people told me the movie will not make sense until the end. So I was
expecting something very clever, something crazy enough that would make me
think for days (The type of intelligent ending that shocks you like the
Sixth Sense did). I was very disappointed when I did reach the end though. I
thought it was predictable. And the movie was just TOO violent to deliver
its message and made my stomach turn many times. The film did get some good
reviews, so try it out for yourself if you wish, but be prepared for
mindless and an unnecessary amount of violence and bloodshed. And do not
expect too much from the ending. While watching, I constructed many ideas
and possible endings that could perhaps make it more interesting and I was
fairly displeased.
