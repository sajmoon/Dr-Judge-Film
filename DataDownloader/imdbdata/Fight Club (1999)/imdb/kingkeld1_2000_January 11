I went to see Fight Club last night. Today I read a lot of the online
reviews. Everybody seems to be focusing on the violence or the kind of heavy
subject we are dealing with. The fall of man and what have you.<br /><br />Well, I found this movie funny as hell. I was laughing all the way through -
as were my friends.<br /><br />This is the most twisted, weird comedy I ever saw. I am sure it's mean to be
like that. Watch it again, and see what I mean! About the story? Mmm... Not
much to tell that isn't told in the other several hundreds of reviews.
