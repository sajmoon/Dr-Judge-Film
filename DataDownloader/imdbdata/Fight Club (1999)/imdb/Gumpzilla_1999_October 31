1999_October 31 

This movie was highly effective for the first hour and a half or so -
I'm a big Edward Norton fan, and he was in full effect here. The film was
quite engrossing, which made it all the more annoying when it seemed to go
off into another movie for the last 30 minutes. In that final half-hour, it
seems a great deal of effort is expended into making the film get sillier
and sillier, and although the ending is fun in a silly sort of way, it
really feels like it compromises the rest of the movie.<br /><br />People say that this holds up well under a second viewing. Having seen
it with several people who were seeing it a second time, I'm not sure how
true that is. There are a lot of clues given earlier in the movie as to
what
the twist is, but, then again, there are also a lot of things that seem
like
they violate the internal consistency of the movie.<br /><br />There's quite a bit to recommend this movie, but it can be (for people
like me) also irritating in the end.<br /><br />6/10
