One of the best twisted movie ever made, oh boy, what a twist...we
hardly believe our own eyes, our on ears. Instead of just winding up,
we again start to think abt d movie from its very beginning <br /><br />&#x22;With a gun barrel between your teeth you speak only in vowels&#x22;<br /><br />We won&#x27;t b able to speak in vowels aft watch d movie, we will just stay
dumbstruck on d chair, speakn hardly nythin..<br /><br />With brad pitt and Edward Norton in the key roles, Helena carter is
also seen in one of her best role. The trio has succeeded in execution
of the characters given to dem in d best way. Adding to that a well
furnished script, with superb direction...<br /><br />I don&#x27;t hesitate to give it an excellent rating, as a matter of fact,
something more than excellent.. <br /><br />&#x22;Please return your seat backs to their full upright and locked
position&#x22; :)
