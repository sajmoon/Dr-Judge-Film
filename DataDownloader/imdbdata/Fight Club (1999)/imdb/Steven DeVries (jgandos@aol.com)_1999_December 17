1999_December 17 

What to say about David Fincher...<br /><br />Well, Alien3 was a compliment to the series, Se7en was a great serial
killer
thriller, The Game, although it stretched the imagination like silly
putty,
was nonetheless a masterpiece, and now, Fight Club.<br /><br />On the surface, at least in the previews, it looked like it was going to
be
an over-the-top, bloody, violent, fighting movie and, to a certain extent,
it was.  But the whole underlying message against consumerism, coupled
with
a plot twist late in the movie that turned it into a sort of paranoid
thriller, not to mention amazing acting performances, made this movie one
of
the best things to happen, not only in 1999, but to film altogether.<br /><br />It had everything - Cinematography, wonderful direction, a great selection
for the cast (whoever decided on Bonham-Carter, commendations are in
order),
and amazing dialogue.  The script was full of quotes and monologues that
will be pilfered for years to come, from the well known &quot;I want you to hit
me as hard as you can&quot;, to the clever &quot;On a long enough timeline,
everyone's
survival rate drops to zero.&quot;<br /><br />Some say that the theme of anti-consumerism was enough, and that the plot
twist (which I'm certainly not going to reveal, it's one of the best
twists
I've seen in a long time, and I can't imagine how horrible it would be to
have someone *tell* you.) was unnecessary.  I don't usually criticize
people, but I don't understand the reasoning.  First of all, the movie is
based on a book.  And, while you could simply change the whole thing
around
and just use the central theme, that would kind of be in poor taste.
Secondly, it wasn't confusing, didn't take away from the original theme,
and
threw an element of suspense that was not present before.  It also made
you
think &quot;Wait... is that possible?&quot;  And, for me, literally forced me to see
it a second time.  While you could make a point that seeing it again
dabbles
in irony, what with the anti-consumerism theme, the second viewing was a
completely different experience, which only adds to my utter amazement at
this film.<br /><br />If you can't stand violence at all, then maybe this isn't the film for
you.
But if you can deal with some fighting scenes, which were pretty graphic,
and some sickening gunshot wounds, weeding your way through that will
certainly allow you to reap the benefits of a movie that is definitely
worth
two hours.
