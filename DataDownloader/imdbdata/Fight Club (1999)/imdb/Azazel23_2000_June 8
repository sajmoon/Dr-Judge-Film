How can a movie based on the hard facts of life, gettin back to basics and
the simple things in life be so fantasic and so mind blowing? Once again
we
have stumbled across a timeless classic, a movie to be remembered for the
ages! Edward Norton , currently one of the best actors today portrays the
character perfectly. Brad Pitt, couldnt have been better cast as Tyler
Durden, as i personlly am not a fan of Pitt but liked him in this movie.
The
movie is based on one of the best written scripts ever written and i
suggest
you see this movie as soon as you can as it can be ruined for you in one
sentance. This movie rebels against everyday hollywood scripts, and makes
its own formula to success instead of following the same old boring
repetitive storylines. If this comment can make 1 person out there watch
and
love FIGHT CLUB , i will die a happy man
When u watch this movie you will suddenly gain a new respect for life and
the art of soap-making!
