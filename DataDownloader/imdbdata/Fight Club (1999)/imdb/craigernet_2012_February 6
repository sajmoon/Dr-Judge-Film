Multiple Personality Disorder i have it i relate. have woke up beat up
getting calls i beat some dude up and drank and smoked and things i
would not do you can lose everything or gain to your wildest dreams.
This movie has the potential to be everything it should amazing
psychedelic sequences an imaginative exploration of what it is to be
lost in the trapping of your second self you lose all memory of all you
do from that personality and honestly you do deny you tell yourself
their wrong and become worse and worse and then you can not take the
disgust. What makes it wrong to be something your not if possibly they
have made you better just because this movie has a lot of depression
from that model you see how you convert into our primal state and will
be made into a force stranger to ourselves <br /><br />And Shepherds we shall be For thee, my Lord, for thee. Power hath
descended forth from Thy hand Our feet may swiftly carry out Thy
commands. So we&#xFEFF; shall flow a river forth to Thee And teeming with
souls shall it ever be. In Nomeni Patri Et Fili Spiritus Sancti.
