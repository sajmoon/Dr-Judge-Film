When you expect everything from a movie it is not what you get but this
is a movie that proves you wrong. It is full of action, drama,
thriller, etc. The best thing in the movie is that they direct it
beautifully. They do not miss a single point that they want to prove in
a movie. They shoot every scene carefully and skilfully. The acting of
the lead roles including Marla was amazing. You cannot miss this movie.
You have to see it at least once in your lifetime if your a fan of
Hollywood movie.<br /><br />This is by far the best movie that i have watched. It has all that you
need to entertain you. I did not personally find any fault in the
movie. From the time Brad Pit enters, the movie goes to a high and
never comes back down.
