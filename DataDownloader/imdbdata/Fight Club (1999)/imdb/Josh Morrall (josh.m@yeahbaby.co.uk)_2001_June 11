Fight Club appears to be violence and blood and lots of Brad Pitt asking
people to hit him as hard as they can. But upon viewing, it is much, much
more. The story line will not be clear until three or four views, and there
are hours of fun to be had finding the Brad Pitt subliminals at the
beginning of the film as a way of introducing a character. The DVD double
disk box is faultless, and has featured on it the best commentary found for
any film. Fight Club will have you laughing, crying, feeling horny and
wretching all at the same time. Not for the faint of stomach...
