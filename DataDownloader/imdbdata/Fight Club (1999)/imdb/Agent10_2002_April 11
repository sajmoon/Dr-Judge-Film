Fight Club will be prodded, studied and viewed for years. Whether
its putting down the fascist ideals of conservative America, its
speaking volumes about the pointless intricacies of wealth and
status. Fight Club isn't about violence, its about the expunging of
shallow capitalist maxims and rebirth, an epiphany of real life.<br /><br />Granted, the film's own preaching can be twisted and used
against it, but the inherent messages one can derive from such a
film will be deeper and more meaningful than your trite romance or
teen-sex comedy. A gem for all who have seen it.
