I am new to this whole website and so my first movie to look at was fight
club. After reading a few well written reviews I came across one that was
ignorant and stupid. Fight Club is not trying to promote violence, infact
the complete opposite. We watch how the life of a man goes down the pan
from
fighting and self destruction to the point where he shoots himself. This
film holds so many messages that its pretty pointless trying to argue
with
you but I just think you should lay of it a bit. Its a great film for
those
who can read into the plot, I hope everyone who watches this comes away
with
a different message.<br /><br />By the way everyone who likes the film should read the
book!
