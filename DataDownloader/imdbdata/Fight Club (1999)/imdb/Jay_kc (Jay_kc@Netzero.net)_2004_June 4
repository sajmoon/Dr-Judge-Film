Fight Club is possibly one of the most powerful movies you could watch.
Working in a lousy depressing job, Edward Norton, an insomniac dragging
along the bottom of society meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt.) Soon, the
two discover a new form of therapy and realize the answer to life is
not cute Swedish furniture and khakis. Fight Club is possibly such a
powerful movie because it is so easy to identify with. Almost anyone
who's hit rock bottom or caught a glimpse of the bottom can see a bit
of themselves in Edward Norton's character. Also, the movie itself has
an amazing story with a killer surprise near the end. I would suggest
renting....no, buying this movie. If you haven't seen it before you're
in for a treat.<br /><br />Just to make a note, Chuck Palahniuk wrote Fight Club (the book), if
you enjoy this movie, I'd suggest looking into his other books as well,
they're very entertaining.
