I refuse to go into any in-depth description of why I think you should see
this movie. I won't even pick a particular scene to dissect, which is what I
usually do in my user comments. This is classic stuff, people. Not only
that, it gets better every time you watch it. It kind of drags at one point
but not enough to ruin the perfect rating I'm undoubtedly going to give it.
Currently one of the top three dvd's you can buy, especially if you have the
proper home theater. See the movie. Love the movie. Buy the dvd, treasure
the dvd. If you are a film lover and you haven't seen this, triple shame on
you. Rating: ***** out of *****.
