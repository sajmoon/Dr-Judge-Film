A lot of people have claimed this is a guy's movie, but I think anyone with
a mind can appreciate it. If many of the critics would look deeper into the
movie, they would see how truly wonderful it was. On the surface it is quite
stupendous. The acting both by Edward Norton (brilliant) and Brad Pitt
(impressive) brings the characters to reality (or at least as far as each
character should go into reality.) The visuals are beautiful. The screenplay
is probably the greatest feature of them all (because it was based on a
great book)- I can't think of any movie that is more quoteable than this.
Deeper it carries important messages about materialism and the dangers of
life growing too mundane. If people would stop complaining about the
violence for one minute and actually watch, they'd see that it condemns the
root of what they complain about.
