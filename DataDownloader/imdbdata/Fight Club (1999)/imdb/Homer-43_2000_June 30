Once again, after 'American History X', Edward Norton did the movie that's
my favorite of the year. But this time, with 'Fight Club', he made my
all-time favorite. I've never seen a movie like this before. I think that it
was even a bit better than 'American Beauty', and I can't believe that
'Fight Club' wasn't even nominated for Best Movie, Best Director, Best Actor
and Best Screenplay. Even Brad Pitt was good enough to get an Oscar
nomination. Did they just forget this movie? 
The plot is perfect, as is the direction, this movie has a statement that's
close to 'American Beauty', but 'Fight Club' drives it to the
extreme.
Do what you like and even if haven't got much money, is a large TV really
worth a job you don't like?
This is one of the few movies that are really worth 10 out of
10
