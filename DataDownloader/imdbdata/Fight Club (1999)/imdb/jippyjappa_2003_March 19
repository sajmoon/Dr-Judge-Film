2003_March 19 

Much has been made of how the violence in this movie compares to that of
Clockwork Orange, however they both have one more striking similarity.  In
both films a brilliant first half is eclipsed by a second half that loses
focus and purpose.<br /><br />While it is a very humorous movie, the second half collapses under it's
own
weight, failing to see or realize the satire evident in the novel.  The
film's end cuts out the original ending of the book- which is a classic
mind-f**k that the film is not sophisticated to appreciate.  The whole
intellectual side of the movie and Norton character and his progression
from
beginning to end is overshadowed by pointless action such as the fight in
the garage between Norton and Pitt.  By the time the female lead shows up
again at the end we hardly remember the significance of her role in the
film's beginning.  The support groups that lead into the story also serve
as
a very simplistic foil to the support club of the fight club- their
original
significance in the mind of Norton is lost along with most of the other
intellectual aspects of the story.  The director is brilliant and has
great
style but seems to lose focus on what he is trying to say- if he even
knows...
