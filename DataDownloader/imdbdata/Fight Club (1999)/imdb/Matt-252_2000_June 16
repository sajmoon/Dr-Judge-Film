Amazing movie - saw it months ago, just got the dvd, and I'm still amazed.
Enjoyable on so many levels: as just a guy action movie as well as an
actual
great film.  Fincher is always visually stunning and makes you think -
almost a step further than Kubrick as far as I'm concerned.  Great
writing -
great lines, which makes it so great to see a second time. Great in the
process they go to escape from the world we've created - he dies inside
(from support groups), he dies outside (fight club), and then he is reborn
(through the anarchy). Makes sense. Fincher also directs really well - you
see little hints throughout the film, how interesting the relationship
between the Narrator and Tyler are. Just great, makes me think a lot about
the film.  Definitely overlooked as a great film...
