This film really blow my mid when i first saw it and had me thinking about
the film for weeks, Not just what is in the film but the messages it is
trying to put across. So I had to see it again and when I did I appreciated
it even more as I could look over knowing what happens in the end. This
film
is my favourite of all time because it is amazing on so many levels. First
there is the great plot of a young man's struggle with society and what he
does as a reaction, second the acting which was just amazing especially
form
the always superb Edward Norton. He was very unlucky not to get an oscar
nominations which he deserved. As well Brad Pitt pulled of some great
acting
even better than in Twelve Monkeys. The amazing direction that David
Fincher
brings to this film. Fincher in my opinion is one of the best directors
around and is up there with Ridley Scott. Great CG shots are used in this
film with many great effects coming out of the use of this technology.<br /><br />This film has an weird and wonderful originality to it, which is also seen
in Being John Malkovich. There are many great quotes form this film that
will be remember in history for years to come. The film it self has already
become an over night film cult classic. I would truly recommend this film
to
everyone, even if after watching it you dislike it it becuase it is a
brilliant mind blowing film with just the right mix of comedy, action,
drama
and a twist that will blow your mind.
