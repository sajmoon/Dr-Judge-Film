easily one of the most poignant, and effectual films of our
generation...Edward Norton has surpassed his stunning performance in
American History X and Brad Pitt has legitimized himself as a serious
involved actor who's limits have yet to be seen.  Simply Brilliant... I've
heard people criticize the movie with out looking for the message it was
trying to convey.  These people are &quot;consumers&quot; and are threatened by the
movies message.
