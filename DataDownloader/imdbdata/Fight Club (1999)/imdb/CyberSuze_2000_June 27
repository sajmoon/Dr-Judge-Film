After seeing countless advertisements for it, I thought I had a pretty
good
idea what this movie was about. A movie about a bunch of guys beating the
crap out of each other didn't hold much appeal for most women except, I
suppose, those who hate men. And why would someone use a pink bar of soap
to
advertise such a film? I didn't know and I didn't particularly care. I
knew
I'd get around to seeing it eventually--where and when didn't seem too
important. But, after viewing a rented copy of this movie, I find I want
to
know everything I possibly can about it.<br /><br />Surprisingly, Fight Club is a relationship movie. It's about the
relationships one man has with himself, and others, and what they all
represent. And, like most of my favorite tales, it includes at least one
poignant love story.<br /><br />The narrator of Fight Club, played brilliantly by Edward Norton, begins as
a
lonely insomniac. We accompany him on his search for some meaning in his
life, which is irrevocably altered after meeting a new &quot;single-serving
friend&quot; (Brad Pitt) on one of his many business trips. This new friend,
who
sells homemade boutique soaps, introduces the lost young man to a far more
lively lifestyle, where each experience is met head-on and where fighting
becomes a way to connect with other lost souls like himself.<br /><br />The relationships in this film are complex and, for the most part,
well-developed, with &quot;Fight Club&quot; being the character binding most of the
others together. There are no women involved in the fight scenes of the
movie, but there are a couple of women with significant roles,
particularly
Helena Bonham Carter, who plays the love interest. She seems to be on a
mission to reverse the typecasting of the virtuous women she played in
most
of her early films and she certainly succeeds with Fight Club. I had a
hard
time relating to this brash woman throughout most of the film, identifying
more with the male characters, though I never felt eager to fight. In the
end, her character illustrated the differences that men and women have in
dealing with the same situations and feelings.<br /><br />The Fight Club DVD set truly takes advantage of the format in the best
possible way, with multiple commentary tracks and all sorts of technical
information for &quot;how'd they do that?&quot; viewers like myself. Fight Club is a
story that will stay with me for a long time. I loved this movie and plan
to
add it to my permanent collection.
