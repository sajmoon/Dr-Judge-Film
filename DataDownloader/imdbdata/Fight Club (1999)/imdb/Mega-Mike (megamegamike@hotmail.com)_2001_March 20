When I first saw the previews for this movie, it had me interested.  A movie
about guys who fight - it didn't seem to deep, but I thought it would
provide entertainment.  I had heard buzz about, a few of my friends raved
about it for a few days, and I was convinced.  I should see this movie.  I
went to my local video store and picked up the last remaining DVD.  I popped
it in, sat in amazement until the last credit rolled, and then watched it
again.  And again.  And again.<br /><br />This movie is dark and disturbing, however, it is equally smart and
stylistic.  I found it hard to watch at points, but I couldn't turn my eyes
away.  Fight Club makes many bold statements against the modern
consumer-driven society, and produces Norton's best performance and Pitt's
second best (12 Monkeys).<br /><br />Norton plays an average-Joe who is living a dead-end life.  He needs
something to change his life.  Tyler and Marla will take care of this, and
that is all I want to give away.  Other comments will tell you more, but I
suggest you let it all sink in while watching.  As for it's ending, it
doesn't rival 'The Sixth Sense' - it blows it away.  One of the best movie
endings I've seen.  Even better if you're a Pixies fan.<br /><br />As for it being important, don't worry.  You will be hearing about this
movie.  When 'A Clockwork Orange' came out, it was met with mixed reviews,
deemed too dark and violent, and is now considered a classic.  These two
movies share quite a bit in common - both were based on great books.  If you
haven't read either, get to it.  Politicians will use this movie as a
demonstration of careless and consequenceless violence in movies, and as a
perfect example of what today's youth are being influenced by.<br /><br />Watch this movie, and watch it again with some of your more intelligent
friends.  10 out of 10.
