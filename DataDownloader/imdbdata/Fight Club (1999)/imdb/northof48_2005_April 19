This movie left my mind swirling in awe.<br /><br />The first time I saw this movie I though it was a guy flick. Boy was I
wrong. It has to be the best psychological drama ever made.<br /><br />This movie will leave your emotions all over the road map. It is funny,
scary, sad and comforting all at the same time.<br /><br />Easily a cult classic. You will find yourself wanting to watch it over
and over again.<br /><br />This role was made for Edward Norton. His performance was brilliant as
were the performances of his supporting cast.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie, you must watch it. Be cautioned
though... You will be shocked! Not everyone can handle it's raw
content. But give yourself time to absorb it, watch it a second or
third time and you will be dumb founded.
