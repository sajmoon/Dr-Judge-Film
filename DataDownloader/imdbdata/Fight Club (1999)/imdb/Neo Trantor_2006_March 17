This movie has everything! It's entertaining, it has great visuals and
a good soundtrack, very good actors and a mind blowing story with
subliminal messages that perhaps let you think completely different
about your life! This also is one of few movies I can watch again and
again. Most movies become boring once you know the whole story, but
this one gets even more exciting. You'll notice details you will sure
have missed before and perhaps there is just another aha-effect after
watching it a few times. I have the special edition DVD with some very
interesting extras you shouldn't miss too. Tyler says: get this movie
and watch it!
