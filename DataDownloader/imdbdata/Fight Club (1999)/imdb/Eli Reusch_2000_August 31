2000_August 31 

This film is ingrained in my psyche like the Sword in the Stone.  From my
first viewing of &quot;Fight Club&quot; I knew that David Fincher was fast becoming
the Kubrick of our generation.  I say this because Fincher's level of
perfectionism and stylistic flawlessness has only ever been parallelled by
that late genius, may he rest in peace.  When I first saw &quot;Seven&quot; I knew
that he was a director to watch out for.  Five years later, we don't have
to
watch out.  We have to bow down and kiss the feet of the leader of the new
school of filmmaking.<br /><br />What sets &quot;Fight Club&quot; apart from its contemporaries is its special
effects
(I'll get to the excellent story later).  All CGI, and none of it looked
like a stupid cartoon (take a note, George Lucas).  It all lasted long
enough for you to get the effect of it without realizing that it was
totally
fake.<br /><br />The story, based on Chuck Palahniuk's fantastic and haunting novel, should
strike a chord with every man my age (early to mid 20s).  Uhls's script
says
to the contemporary American man &quot;There is nothing more you can do to make
this world any better than it already is, and making it worse isn't going
to
help anyone.&quot;  It ignites a fire of discontent in the American male, as it
should, but also lets him in on a secret:  EVERYTHING YOU DO HAS
CONSEQUENCES.  The film is violent, but with a moral center stronger than
anything I have seen.  Edward Norton's narrator is perhaps the most
genuine
character ever put to film and proves himself to be one of the finest
actors
of our generation.<br /><br />I applaud a major studio for taking a bit of a bath on this one.  It
didn't
do the best at the box office, but they released something real that will
be
remembered as long as movies continue to be made, and will be held as a
standard for contemporary directors to work from.  Thank you David Fincher
and 20th Century Fox for giving me and my generation a movie and a
director
we can believe in.
