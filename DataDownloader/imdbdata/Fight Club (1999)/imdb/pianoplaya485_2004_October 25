I believe this film to be great. For all those non-believers out there,
I cant possibly understand how anyone would this think film to be
mediocre. Edward Norton, and Brad Pitt have a great chemistry
throughout the entire movie, and the intro for the movie is also very
catchy. The dialogue was great, the only thing that I find people
complain about is the influences that Tyler Durdan(spelling?) has in
the movie, and how his speeches, and ways etc.. are too real. Thats
what makes the movie great, when you can feel him almost influencing
your life is when you know that its a powerful movie. Only drawback of
the film in my eyes would be how it seemed unrealistic when tyler
started making his whole project bigger, and all the banks people were
his people, so he got away with the whole bombing the banks thing, just
don't find it possible, maybe thats the point...anyways 9/10
