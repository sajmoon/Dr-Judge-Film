2008_November 3 
Everything is good about this film. I haven&#39;t read the book because it
was sold out in my country so fast and newer released again, maybe if I
try just a little bit more I probably would be able to get it but I&#39;m
to lazy for that. Anyways the movie is great. The direction was superb.
All the actors were very suitable for their roles. Brad Pitt was great
as always and I&#39;m pretty sure that this is the best his movie. Same
goes to Edward Norton (who is one of my favorite actors). Helena Bonham
Carter did also a great job as Marla Singer. Just today by watching
this film maybe 10th time in my life, I noticed that Bob is played by
Meat Loaf, that was a very good choice in my opinion. I noticed that
the sound effects in this film were very realistic. The plot was very
twisted and interesting. Really worth watching film.
