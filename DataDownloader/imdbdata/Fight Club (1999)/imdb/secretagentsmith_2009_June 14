This is one of my all time top films. It was incredible and very
thought-provoking, contains some of my favourite movie quotes: &#x22;It&#x27;s
only after we&#x27;ve lost everything that we&#x27;re free to do anything&#x22;.<br /><br />Edward Norton was fantastic and I can&#x27;t believe he didn&#x27;t win an Oscar.<br /><br />Before I saw this I thought Brad Pitt was some pretty boy with no real
acting skills, but now I understand that he is a very good quality
actor and a bit of a legend.<br /><br />Brilliant soundtrack too-which helped one of the best endings ever,
with my favourite band, the pixies and their brilliant &#x27;where is my
mind?&#x27;.<br /><br />If you haven&#x27;t seen this film... GET ON IT!!!
