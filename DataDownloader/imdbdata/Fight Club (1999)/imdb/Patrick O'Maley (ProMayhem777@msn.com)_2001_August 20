This is by far one of the very few great films out there. It a
original
plot that will keep you guessing. It truly gets better every time you watch
it. I particularly enjoyed all the little subliminal messages and jokes. As
for the the directing this proves once more that David Fincher is a GENIUS!
This is one of the best directed films ever. If you never witnessed this
work of art I drive you with a passion to, but you must watch it at the
very
lest 3 or 4 times. And if you know me you know that I'm rather a hard
grader. 10/10
