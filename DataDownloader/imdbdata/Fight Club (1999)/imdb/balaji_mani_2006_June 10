Fight Club is quite possibly the greatest film of all time. The
philosophy of the film transcends beyond in-time structures. there is a
whole coolness about film, the characters of Tyler and Jack
representing and mirroring the wants and state of society. Palahniuk&#39;s
story is cleverly utilised by Uhl&#39;s to give one of the best scripts and
Fincher&#39;s direction is amazing. It is a film that if watched only once
doesn&#39;t leave much of an impression however if watched 2-3 times most
of you will be fans. It is such a complex film with small intricacies
added by Fincher to give the film a world encompassing overtone.<br /><br />Tyler is the essence of suave, he is the f**k you and up yours to the
world whereas Jack is the your average Joe. Combined, this usual
partner matchup, is used uniquely to give interesting twist to what
could have been a poorly made film.<br /><br />Pitt&#39;s and Norton&#39;s performances in this film are amazing, they convey
their respective character;s perfectly and make you believe that they
truly are Tyler and Jack.<br /><br />Many believe this film preaches nihilism and Buddhism, it does to a
large extent. However Palahniuk has stated in a interview, that Fight
Club is more in the vein of romanticism rather nihilism. It is an
expression of individual&#39;s rebellion against consumerist and archaic
social constructs. The manner in which this is done is highly
nihilistic though.<br /><br />I recommend to anyone and everyone and please watch it at least three
times. Each time the story opens up becomes even richer and better. In
my opinion one of the greatest films ever made.
