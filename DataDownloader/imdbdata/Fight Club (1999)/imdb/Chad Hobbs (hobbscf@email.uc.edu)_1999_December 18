Fight club is one of the most &quot;polished&quot; movies I have seen in a long
time.
It reminded me at times of Blue Velvet, in the way it seemed to take place
in a fantasy world.  Other times it reminded me of Clockwork Orange.<br /><br />The rebellious spirit of the main character resembles Ben from the
Graduate
(norton talks about this in an interview from Yale)
Both Edward Norton's charater and Ben were all about deviating from the
path
which had been set in front of them.<br /><br />Another movie which reminds me a little of Fight Club is Blair Witch.  In
Blair Witch part of the charm of the movie is leaving certain things
unknown.  Fight Club accomplishes the same thing by giving the viewer only
bits of real story and snippits of inspiration.  Fincher doesn't beat you
over the head with meaning.  He lets the audience think for themselfs.
This
makes Fight Club better and different each time you watch it.<br /><br />The sound and 3d animations/graphics are inspirational.  With Jurrasic
Park
we were shown just about anything is possible with computers.  In Fight
Club
the 3d animations are cut seamlessly into the film.  The soundtrack is
perfect.  The Dust Brothers electronic music is fast and slick.  It
creates
a feeling of another world.  A world 5 years in the future.
The opening credits are the best I have ever seen.  The animation and the
score fit perfectly together.  My only complaint about the animations and
effects is that there was not enough.  It seems like all the cool effects
are in the first 30min of the film, with a couple extra during the rest of
the film.<br /><br />The acting was wonderful.  Pitt's performance reminds me of 12 Monkeys.
And
Norton's is just as powerful and intense as he was in American History X.<br /><br />The humor in the movie was seemless as well.  There were no &quot;big laughs&quot;
like in an Adam Sandler movie, but I was constantly snickering and
grinning.
The humor is very smart.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to everyone.  However everyone will not like it,
just
like Blair Witch.  Fight Club however will definitely get people talking.<br /><br />
