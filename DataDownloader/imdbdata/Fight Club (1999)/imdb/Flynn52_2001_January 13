This film is worth to watch it 3 times minimum.
The camera-effects are high-level...a candy for the eyes.
Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are good choices to play the roles
excellent.<br /><br />If you would like to see a film about criticism of our &quot;money is
god&quot;-society...this is the film you should try.
And a lot of good jokes will bring a smile on your lips.
