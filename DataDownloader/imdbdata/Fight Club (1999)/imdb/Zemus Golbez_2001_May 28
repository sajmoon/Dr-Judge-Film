Fight Club is like a mix between; American Beauty, 12 Monkeys, and The
Sixth
Sense (but better). If you rented this movie for its title, you probably
realized it wasn't what you expected about five minutes in. This movie has
more to offer than a bunch of guys mutilating each other. It is
narrated(in
a dark monotone way) by the main character played by Edward
Norton(American
History X). Norton realizes his life sucks and his only way to unwind
consists of purchasing furniture from catalogs, until Tyler Durden (played
by Brad Pitt) comes along. I don't want to spoil it for you so I will just
tell you, Fight Club is a definite cult classic with an ending that proves
you can't watch it just once. This movie; is extremely well written, well
acted, and contains many quotable lines(not to mention some very
appropriate
cinematography). If your looking for a dark, intelligent movie you must
see
Fight Club.
