This film is a religion, a philosophy in and of itself. If you have yet to
see this masterpiece of a generation, I recommend that you experience the
film a minimum of three times as you gain a better sense of its greatness
with each viewing. A can't think of a recent example of performances on
par
with those of the actors in Fight Club. If you have avoided watching the
film because you aren't keen on the violence aspect of the it, I implore
you
to look beyond the title and fight sequences to the messages that lie
within. Go into it with an open mind and be willing to have your
perspective
contorted in ways you've never imagined. Don't let the end scene disturb
you
after recent events, keep in mind what they're doing. No other movie has
the
plethora of quotables that Fight Club contains. I'll stop now and
hopefully
let the movie speak for itself as I'm sure I have failed to do it
justice.
