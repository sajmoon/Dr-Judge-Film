One of the weirdest movies I've ever seen. Also one of the
best.<br /><br />Edward Norton gave a great performance as the Narrator (and Corneilus), but
was not recognized by the AMPAS. Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter gave
good performances too.<br /><br />I thought to myself before renting this movie, who would want to make a
movie where all people do is fight? It sounds terrible. Just watch it. It
was not a box office hit, and I'm not really surprised. I think, however,
you should see this movie if you want to be a film student. Sounds weird,
but it's a classic.<br /><br />Another great thing about this movie, is it has no plot. It's so confusing,
doesn't really have a plot, and it seems like it's being made up as it's
going along. <br /><br />I would not recommend this movie if you are disturbed by violence. If
violence doesn't disturb, see it. If you love violent movies, buy the DVD as
soon as you can. Grade: A
