This film is an instant classic. It takes every theme dealt with today and
puts a new spin on them. The way it tackles life in an ever-changing
technologically-inclined world is a site to be seen. First off, the acting
is superb, with Brad Pitt giving the performance of his life and Edward
Norton giving a dazzling performance. This is my first review and I am
keeping it short, so overall this is one of THE best films of all time,
EVER.
10/10
