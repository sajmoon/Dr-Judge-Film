2006_January 4 
As you watch the film from the beginning, there is a chance for a deep
film that goes inside the mind of the narrator (Edward Norton) and his
counter-part Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), and mostly the film succeeds for
showing the slow transformation of the narrator into Tyler through the
creation of an underground fight club. The premise works, however,
there are too many times where the movie switches from the surreal to
the utmost impossible. Though the film builds up in the first 2/3 the
last is disappointing with just an idiotic ending plot along with an
incoherent story. Though the narrator goes into a mode of
&quot;self-discovery&quot; and the idea of man vs. himself in the end, which
works, it isn't enough to save the film from keeling over from the
abomination known as the human thirst for quick sell-outs for which the
book version tries to state to all. A sad and pathetic form of a movie
which could have been so much more.
