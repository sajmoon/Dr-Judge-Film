Without a shadow of doubt, my favourite movie of all time.
Understandably not so favoured among a few, but even those whom have
watched it with me. (my mother included) have appreciated the
complexity, the creativity and the sheer brilliance of this film and
it&#39;s delivery.<br /><br />Those who haven&#39;t watched it before, finish the movie with a new
perspective on the good to great movie classification. Those that have
seen it already gain further appreciation through the minor and major
intricacies placed throughout the movie.<br /><br />As a secondary note, if you have or are thinking of getting the DVD, it
also has one of the best commentaries recorded.<br /><br />So without giving any of the details away, the truth of the plot maybe
better known to you than you realise whilst watching it. As to the
question of whether or not you will enjoy this movie.... In Tyler we
trust.
