When fight club first came out i didn't care to even find out what it was
about, jut the name made me think I knew what it was all about, but boy was
i ever wrong.Later when it came out on video I thought what can be the harm
if it turns out to be one of those testosterone movies i can always take it
back. But for the 2+ hours that it was on I couldn't move an inch, I mean i
knew Brad Pitt could act (i mean if you think he's a play boy you need to
wake up )but this was unbelievable he pulled it off without a hitch. As for
Edward Norton i never thought he'd out do Primal Fear but now I forget why
I
thought that cause he he took me away. If you want one of the best movies
made in a long time, one that will keep you on the edge of your seat
guessing every min. this is it.And don't worry about the other sex both
will
love it believe you me.
As for commenting on movie events, even one word would ruin the thrill of
it, there is no other way to feel it but to see it!!
