The first two-thirds of this film are masterclasses in
acting,storytelling,direction and camerawork. The final third loses some of
that, but does not take away from the fact that this was the best film of
1999(followed by 8MM).<br /><br />Rent it, buy it, steal it or fight someone for it, but just get this film.
You will be impressed.
