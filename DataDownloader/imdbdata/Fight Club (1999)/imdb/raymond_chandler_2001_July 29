 I liked this movie very much, but, as I am older than the Gen X target
audience, it was not a life-changing experience for me. Still, I was quite
blown away by some of the film technique, the plot was deliciously
subversive for an aging Bolshevik like myself, and the ending made me feel
like my scalp was being peeled away. I sure as heck did not see THAT
coming!! Instantly, multiple viewings became mandatory. When I get around to
buying a DVD player, you can bet that &quot;Fight Club&quot; will be one of the first
flicks I buy.<br /><br />Not much I can add to what has already been said. The sheer BALLS that this
movie has are impressive. Thank God for David Fincher! Here is a guy who
understands that bravura, cutting-edge film technique and good storytelling
are NOT mutually exclusive. He and Aronofsky (PI, Requiem for a Dream) are
about the only signs of hope for American moviemaking, which is currently in
the fourth year or so of an appalling slump. With Baz Luhrman (Moulin
Rouge), these guys should make it worthwhile to head down to the old
multiplex for years to come. But, PUH-leese, no &quot;FIGHT CLUB 2&quot;,
OK?
