When 'Fight Club' first appeared at cinemas I was disinterested - the
initial trailers made it look just another mindless action/beat 'em up movie
of the Van Damme ilk.  Finally, listening to many &quot;it's nothing like it
sounds&quot; speeches from friends, I acquiesced and rented the video. It blew me
away, a cliche that is not tired when applied to this film.<br /><br /> It's a spectacularly original, clever, insightful, well scripted, acted and
shot movie that really made me feel guilty about having made such token
judgements based on title and violence level alone.  And so I should
be.
 
 There's little to be gained from recounting the plot, and besides, it would
just spoil the multi-faceted set of brilliant plot twists that lead up to
the fantastically downbeat end sequence. 'Fight Club' is like an entirely
self contained film revolution, and ranks alongside 'American Beauty' as one
of the greatest films of 1999, and indeed the last decade. Sure to be a
classic.
