I believe that &quot;Fight Club&quot; is about one single person, Edward Norton's
character. There are no other characters in the movie. He made
everything up in his mind; Tyler, Marla, the Fight Club. The real issue
is a man fighting a psychological battle within himself. The only
person in this movie who dies is Bob. This is very significant, I
believe it is to show the final loss of innocence within Norton's
character. Obviosly Tyler and Edward Norton's character are one person,
so that explains a lot. But after I thought about, I began to see how
nothing was real. He created a world within his mind where he could be
safe, surrounded by material possessions,then his mind won him
over;this is where Marla comes into play, Marla is the symbol of his
final collapse of reality; evil winning over good. She invades the safe
place in his mind which ultimately begins his destructive path.
Finally, at the end of the movie, he over comes everything he has been
fighting against. Throughout the movie, Tyler was always stressing that
he did the things he did in order to set them free. By Norton's
character shooting himself at the end, he destroys his mind, killing
himself, and finally being free. (When Marla asks him if he is okay, he
says that everything is alright). Now, you don't see him physically
die, this is because the end of the movie(with the bright lights from
the buildings) his mind and soul are being released into the
afterlife.(his mind lives on, therefore the event of death is seen from
a mental, not physical point of view) Hard concept to accept, watch the
movie again, there are many hints that give it away. &quot;They say he was
born in an asylum.&quot; You be the judge.
