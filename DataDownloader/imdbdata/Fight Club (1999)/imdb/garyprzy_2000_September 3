Fight Club is outstanding. But one must be able to see the whole thing
through, be open minded, (politically correct people need not apply) &amp;
smart
enough to enjoy satirical humor. This movie reminds me of Dr. StrangeLove.
The movie works on several levels but I think many people who hate this
movie simply cannot think beyond the most superficial levels.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a fantastic screenplay, clean directing, exciting
cinematography, and great acting, (especially Norton &amp; Helena Bonham
Carter). This movie catches you on so many levels. At one point your
laughing hard at some situation while another part of you realizes your
seeing a simple truth in another.<br /><br />It's a shame more pictures aren't this truthful.
