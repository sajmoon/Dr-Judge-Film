1999_October 9 

One of my most anticipated movies for this year, and I walked away from a
sneak screening completely devestated along with about everyone else that
saw it with me. You couldn't have a better first Act. The second is equally
tense, funny, and disturbing. If you don't mind the violence (which I
don't)
you will be at the end of the second act ready for a incredible explosive
conclusion. Instead, the story turns ludicrous and all is explained in a
shallow, all-to-easy manner, cheapening-- invalidating the entire film,
much
in the same way the Game also faltered in the end, but ten time worse,
mainly because the film had such potentional, whereas the Game never really
does. Acting and directing is superb, but the story obviously works better
on paper than on the screen. Still see it, but don't expect to like
it.
