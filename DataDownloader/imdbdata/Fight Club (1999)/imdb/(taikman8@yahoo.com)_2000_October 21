One of the worst movies that I have seen in recent years.  The story is
all
over the place and depressing as hell.  I thought the movie was about
underground fighting and betting on it.  Unfortunately, it is about an
idiot's ideal of the darker side of his life.  I like Brad Pitt and Ed
Norton, but I would rather watch Seven or Primal Fear over and over again
than watch another minute of Fight Club.
