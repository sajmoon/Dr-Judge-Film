For all intents and purposes, this is a Hollywood production. It has all the
ingredients of the classic Hollywood narrative. Big budget. Big director.
Big cast. And yet, it embodies everything that Hollywood stands
against.<br /><br />It doesn't take a brain surgeon to see that this is an anti-consumerist
film. The destruction of the BMWs, the questioning of Calvin Klein models as
'real men'. Anti-consumerist? Hollywood? Home of the American dream? Surely
not?<br /><br />And yet, it IS a Hollywood movie. Good eventually prospers over evil. The
guy gets the girl. Everyone lives happily ever after (albeit with a hole in
their cheek). For the most part, audiences love this movie. The fact that it
is rated at a modest #42 on imdb's top 250 films of all time is an
indication of this; and yet I can see why some people would hate
it.<br /><br />The acting can't be faulted - or more to the point, the choice of casting
can't be faulted. Pitt is perfect as the self-destructive anti-hero. He
embodies everything that men aspire to be. Brutally honest, perversely
funny, sexually appealing and with more than a slight hint of danger about
him. As a male myself, I believe I speak for my gender as a whole when I say
that we have all at one point dreamed of being Tyler Durden and/or Brad
Pitt. 
With the possible exception of 'American History X', this could well be
Norton's biggest challenge to date. Nerdy yet sadistic. His character
develops from product-obssessed insomniac to highly volatile fighting
machine and ends up somewhere in between. 'The Italian job' and 'Red dragon'
showed us nothing of his ability, but we can forgive him on the merit of
this.<br /><br />But with all this in mind, some still dislike the film. Some argue it is too
violent. Some say it is not realistic enough. For the most part, critics of
the film are disappointed by the lack of closure - as was I upon first
viewing. Who REALLY wins between the two? What becomes of Jack? Has the
damage already been done? Where do we go from here? It is only upon several
latter viewings that we realise that these questions are of minor
importance. In fact, they were probably never meant to be answered.<br /><br />Four stars.
