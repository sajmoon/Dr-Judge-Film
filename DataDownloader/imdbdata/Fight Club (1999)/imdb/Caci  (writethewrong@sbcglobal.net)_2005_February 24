2005_February 24 
Let me just start out by saying that this is one of my favorite movies
of all time. Reasons being: 1) it was brilliantly done (I'm not gonna
go into cool camera effects and the great music or anything; you've all
seen the movie); 2) it makes so much sense. This movie has changed my
perspective on a lot of things in my life; all the materialism is just
not important, nor does it matter. And it's screwed up, how our society
runs. But that's not why I'm writing this comment.<br /><br />I'm writing this comment to give you all an idea, something to ponder
the next time you choose to watch this movie. I am in tenth grade, and
my Humanities teacher showed this movie in class (the whole thing,
unedited, sex scenes and all) (I had already seen it before). Why would
a teacher show this brutal and harsh movie in class? At the time, we
were working on Romanticism. Here is a definition of Romanticism: a
movement of the 19th century that sought to replace the great emphasis
on reason with a new focus on feelings, emotions, and nature. Nature
often came to replace God, and reason was seen as a restraint on true
feeling. (This definition is extremely vague and I will elaborate a bit
more later on.) Now, how in the world could Fight Club possibly tie in
with Romanticism? A big thing with Romanticism was self-discovery and
liberation from material needs. It was about humans going back to their
primitive state, living in and appreciating nature. Romantic literature
and artwork often portrayed a sense of hopelessness or loss. All of
these things are present in Fight Club. Edward Norton's character is
consumed by his material possessions, and Brad Pitt's character shows
him a way out of it. They start a Fight Club, which gives men a
primitive outlet for their frustration and everything they have pent up
(fighting is an extremely primitive way to solve problems). In the
scene after Edward Norton is injured in the car crash, Brad Pitt begins
to talk about his world, in which people climb on vines wrapping around
the Sears Tower, people wear leather clothes that will last the rest of
their lives, and people pound corn and lay strips of venison on an
abandoned highway. All of these things are obviously Romantic in
nature.<br /><br />I'm presenting you these ideas so that, perhaps, we can learn even more
from this movie that already teaches so much. It's definitely a great
movie that deserves to be seen more than once.
