Three words to define &quot;Fight Club&quot;: crazy, disturbing and BRILLIANT. The
best movie i have ever seen. Lots of people won't like it though, because
it's no more than big criticism on our society, on the way that we live.
Congratulations on performances by Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, both
impressed me a lot.
