I watch movies a lot. I am a woman who mostly likes comedies and films
like
Amelie and Moulin Rouge. Yet, Fight Club blowed my mind
totally.
The story, the story!<br /><br />I was so really happy to witness that still, in these modern days, it is
possible to create stories that are just as powerful as ancient Greek
tragedies. In this story we, the viewers are the choir, the society
hearing
its own voice.<br /><br />That humanity is still able to tell stories like this about itself gives
hope to this globe. I have never seen a movie where showing violence
would
be more justified. It is ugly, yes, but so is society also, so very
ugly.
