This film truly has the potential to be remembered as one of the greatest
of
the nineties.  It is an honest depiction of consumerist discontent, and
along the same lines as &quot;American Beauty&quot;.  Just as Lester Burnham is
tired
with his &quot;little life&quot;, our hero (Ed Norton) needs to make some changes.
He
gets help from Brad Pitt, who comes to help &quot;deliver him from Swedish
furniture&quot;.  He repeats the words that are too true yet so difficult to
admit.  You are not your job, you are not the car you drive, you are NOT
your khakis.  Pitt tries to impart the wisdom that the stuff you own ends
up
owning you.  Just like Spacey told Bening &quot;It's just a couch&quot;.  This film
cannot be recommended strongly enough.  Aside from the gripping story, the
editing and score are worth the price of rental alone.  Each viewing will
reveal a hidden secret, and perhaps you might understand the message that
it
is insane to work at a job you hate to buy stuff you don't
need.
