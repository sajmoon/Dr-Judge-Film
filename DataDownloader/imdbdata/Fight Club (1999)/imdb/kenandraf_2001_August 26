Very good movie aimed at male audience which is an action packed,little
compromise,dark satirical comedy about going over the edge mentally.Seen
thru the perspective of the lunatics,we are thoroughly taken on an adventure
thru madness.To most men,this film is a great ride.Most of us know it is
lunacy yet the film is very good in creating empathy for the main
character's situation.Delve into the anti-social's mind and trip!Pitt is a
great actor.See his performance in this one.Holywood can learn from this
film.We need more like this......
