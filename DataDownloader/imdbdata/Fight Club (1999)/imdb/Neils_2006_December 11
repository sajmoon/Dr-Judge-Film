This is one of the darkest, most graphic and violent movies in years
not apt for those with a weak heart. Edward Norton who takes on the
dual role of the narrator and main actor delivers another great
performance that rivals his stylish take on American History X.
However, the movie finds itself lost in its violence, lost in his
constant desire to portray a sexual tension that you cannot connect
with since all the characters don&#39;t seem to have the chemistry
necessary, even it is just a strictly sexual one. Brad Pitt lands
another very respectable role, but I&#39;m left again with a bitter taste
in my mouth wanting a little more out of his performance. The movie is
still very stylish and original, a decent adaptation from the book. The
ending is what people talk the most about, so I&#39;m not gonna be the only
one NOT to comment on it. I agree with the majority of you who think
the twist is surprising and at the same time climatic, but, is it a
good surprise? I don&#39;t think so. To me, it almost seemed forced, I do
know it follows a book, but is still inconsistent with the rest of the
movie. Fight Club does keep you interested throughout and also keeps
you guessing what will happen next, which makes it an above average
attempt but not in the slightest a great accomplishment.
