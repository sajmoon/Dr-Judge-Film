I know that a lot of people see this movie as some macho guy movie&#133;
Just looking at the surface, which I almost did myself, but this movie
is much more. This movie is about anti-consumerism in the way of
fighting against being human drones manipulated by corporate
commercials. The style and mood of Fight Club make it a masterpiece,
something unique without being pretentious. The genius of this movie is
how it crafted the seeming nerdy Edward Norton matched with the edgy
Brad Pitt and toss in a big case of schizophrenia. OK&#133; This is not
totally a new premise Psycho, A Beautiful Mind, American Psycho to name
a few but this movie takes this story to bazaar journey into the mind
of a man who feels like he is just consumer zombie. The fight scenes
are a little off-putting and unconventional but this is a symbolic way
of showing if you got hit in the face that aggressive action would
really allow you to fully understand living. Fear is the motivating
factor in this movie in how you deal with it and over coming also
displayed in another good movie Defending your Life. Watching Fight
Club give me hope for Hollywood movies in saying something deep and not
have to always result to finding stuff like this in foreign movies or
movies copied from foreign movies.
