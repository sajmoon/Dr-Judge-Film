You know, a lot of friends have talked to me about how brilliant this
movie was. I've seen it twice now, and for the life of me I can't see what
they're talking about. Yes, it is incredibly well-made, and yes, the acting
is superb, but what kind of message is it sending? I understand the
intention(s) of the film. I understand how Fincher has tried to make Fight
Club seem like the only place where these men can feel accepted, or have a
purpose. In fact, the ideas constantly intrigued me throughout the
film--there are no wars or conflicts in today's society, the wars are
inside
of the individual. But why the juvenile terrorism? Why the &quot;go back to
zero&quot;
at the credit card company? It seems like a good premise somewhere along
the
way got bogged down by uneccessary &quot;extra messages&quot; that range from
irrelevant to just plain wrong. A good example: A common theme in the movie
seems to be &quot;be an individual and discover who you are&quot;...then shave your
head, put on a black cloak and assume a generic identity? The entire
message
of the film was muddled, and in the end, I don't really know if there was
an
actual point. I admire Fincher as a director, certainly his cast is
excellent, and the entire movie is beautiful in it's own dark way. But
every
time I reach that climactic ending scene, I feel this emptiness--&quot;Fight
Club&quot; is a movie that started strong and beat itself into an unrecognizable
pulp.
