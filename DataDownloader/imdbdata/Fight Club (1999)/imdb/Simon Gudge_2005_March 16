Although that has been said on many many many films. I consider Fight
Club to be the best film ever made.<br /><br />Brad Pitts Character is amazing. He lives out the role of what any man
would wish he could do. Says the things all men just wish they could
say and lives the way we wouldn't dream of but still makes it look
cool.<br /><br />The storyline itself is so great. I mean a bunch of guys who get
together to fight. And then these guys start a whole new plan which is
so cool.<br /><br />I hope this film is a favourite of any movie fan because i simply love
it. I don't wanna spoil it, it's just a film you have to see to
believe.
