The second rule of Fight Club: Don't waste your money on Fight Club.
Granted, the movie was visually stunning, and mostly well acted, it was an
hour-and several plot-twists too long.
The last of which in an effort to be profound, only ends up being silly and
preposterous. Don't see this movie if you are prone to
headaches.
