Fight Club is an excellent movie, just saw it yesterday for like the
15th time and loved every minute of it. It just never ages. Fight Club
would be always known for its quotes. I loved all of them. Now coming
to my point, I think every special line or quote from fight club had
that added 'touch' with it. This means that whenever a quote or an
excellent line is delivered, there is something about it that's not
clich&eacute;d. This could be an uncommon gesture given by the actors (the way
Brad Pitt looks really cool after most of the memorable lines he
delivers), the addition of playback music (for instance, the wacky
music that starts when Edward Norton says &quot;that really hurt, hit me
again&quot;), complete silence (e.g., when Helena Carter says &quot;My God. I
haven't been fucked like that since grade school.&quot;), crisp editing that
starts with another scene totally not related to previous one only to
make you wonder about what just happened (for example, the narrator
says &quot;Tyler was now involved in a class action lawsuit against the
Pressman Hotel over the urine content of their soup.&quot; and this has no
relation with what happens next). There were few quotes though, that
when the movie is seen for the first time, can go easily unnoticed. My
favorite of these 'unnoticeable quotes' is when Brad Pitt gets up from
the airplane seat next to Edward Norton and says &quot;Now a question of
etiquette; as I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch...?&quot;. Every
other line has a philosophical attachment towards it and is linked to
the main theme of the movie, but this quote just comes out of nowhere
and goes unnoticed. It certainly is my favorite quote. Do you guys
agree? Think about it this way, if it wasn't in the script, it would've
made no difference, but they purposely put it in. It made its way in
because it deserved to be there. Looking forward to comments from you
all regarding this.
