I've seen the movie just 2 days ago in DVD. It gave me goosebumps when
the suspense was revealed. The movie gets quite interesting as it
proceeds but its the final thrill that takes the movie to an all-time
high.It clearly belongs to Brad Pitt and Edward Norton for performing
the characters with such ease.Brad Pitt acts cool and surely has
multiplied his fans through Tyler Durden Hats off to David Fincher for
bringing up such a concept and being able to keep the suspense till
3/4th of the movie.I would recommend this movie to everyone.It deserves
to be in Top 250.Personally, I would rate this movie 9.5/10.<br /><br />I can't do anything, I've Insomnia (IDEA) let's sleep
