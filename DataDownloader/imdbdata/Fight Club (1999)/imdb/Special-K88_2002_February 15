Surreal, mind-boggling story from director David Fincher about a
burned-out businessman who&#x27;s fed up with his life and looking for
something new. He does this by first developing a liaison with a
dissolute woman, then by &#x22;befriending&#x22; a slightly deranged soap
salesman who helps him form an underground network of fight clubs where
grown men relieve their frustrations by beating each other
senseless...but that&#x27;s only the beginning. Good direction, stunning
visuals, and an engrossing story are bolstered by a perfectly stilted
performance from Norton, a wildly over-the-top performance from Pitt,
and a finely tuned performance from Bonham Carter, but the finale
doesn&#x27;t make much sense and seems tacked on. Still, there&#x27;s plenty to
take in, and a lot of intriguing, satirical viewpoints about society&#x27;s
balance of power. **&#xBD;
