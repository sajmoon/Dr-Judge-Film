Fight Club was scorched by critics but may turn out to be a movie with a
&quot;cult&quot; following. This movie was burned by critics for being mindlessly
violent and over preaching at times. Which, is for the most part, true. But
hidden in the script of this movie are alot of truths.<br /><br />Violence in this movie is necessary, I think, to get the point across that
sometimes we really do want to just go with a feeling we have and to just
let go.<br /><br />The only real complaint I have with the movie is it spirals downward at the
end going from a creative plot to a typical action movie act 3. The big
appeal about this movie to me is the unpredictable plot twist near the end.
All in all, Fight Club is one of my favorite movies.
