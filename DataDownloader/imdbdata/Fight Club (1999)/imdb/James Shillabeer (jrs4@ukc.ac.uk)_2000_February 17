2000_February 17 

This film is a deeply felt experience for certain types of people. It
encapsulates a mode of thought which exists amongst
a number of individuals (all ages) to whom society and global economics
are
a realised force in their lives. This is not to say that this is the
consistent conclusions amongst people who are disaffected with
globalisation, but the type of imaginative creatures who are not lured by
the consumerist dream. That this film is seen as unreal to many happy
homemakers is testament to the level of engagement one can have with the
film. If it is viewed as a piece of art in which disbelief must be
suspended, it can not be felt. For some, this twists the soul in a way in
which one wants to be manipulated. The response to this is not to start up
a
'fight club', this surely misses the point, but to
prod and push at the claustrophobic blanket which may veil all degrees of
self. It may become a violent and bloody experience but ultimately
emancipatory.
