If you've ever worked in a cubicle for an extended length of time, you'll
appreciate this fantasy. Great performances by Norton and Pitt.
Interesting - Brad Pitt gets to say some lines very similar to what he says
in the mental institution in 12 Monkeys - the whole &quot;What are we then? we're
consumers ...&quot; thing.<br /><br />Wow - I loved the style this director has - I like it in &quot;The Game&quot;, too.
Lot's of interesting plot twists in this one, too.
