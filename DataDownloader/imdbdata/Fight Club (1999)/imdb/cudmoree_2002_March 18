...because you're going to want to wash off the filth that is Fight Club. 
This movie suffers from &quot;The Emperor's New Clothes&quot; syndrom, just like The
Matrix.  It makes no sense, so people assume that it's wonderful and is they
say otherwise, they'll be considered stupid by the rest of the
sheep.
 Well, I'm not afraid to be called ignorant.  Fight Club flat-out SUCKED. 
It started off on a good note, with the exciting premise of releasing
pent-up male aggression (and Edward Norton with no shirt on!) but the movie
went on to become preachy and self-absorbed.  But Edward Norton was still
shirtless part of the time, so I could ignore the rest. (I mean, it's EDWARD
NORTON!!!)  However, the end came as the biggest disgust.  People, can we
all say &quot;Cop-Out?&quot; It's like David Fincher couldn't come up with a real
ending, so he basically said &quot;It was all in his head&quot;  Psychology is the
deux e machina for the new millenium. 
 And Brad Pitt. Wow. Yuck. He was the grossest part of this film.  Tacky,
looking like a pimp and an unattractive one at that.  I hope if my
personality splits, I don't turn into Brad Pitt.  
 Stop being a flock of sheep and see a real movie!
