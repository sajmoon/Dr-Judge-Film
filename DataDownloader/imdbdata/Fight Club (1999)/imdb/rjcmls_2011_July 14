I first viewed Fight Club when I was a young teenager and loved it not
only for its quotable aphorisms and graphic violence, but for its raw
emotional angst. I never grappled with its philosophical underpinnings
or its moral instructions. <br /><br />I hadn&#x27;t seen it for years until my (rather brilliant) cultural history
professor mentioned it during a lecture. After re-watching it, I see it
for what it is: a commentary on the frivolous nature of the consumer-
capitalist culture of the 90s. It infers that nihilism is the only
rational way to cope with a society characterized by excessive
materialism and controlled by a small coterie looking to exploit the
average man&#x27;s insecurities and impulses. Such is a fascinating way to
consider what we have arrived at in terms of our values. And
considering the cult following this movie has garnered, this idea has
clearly resonated with people. <br /><br />Movies that are able to define something as complex as an entire
culture are infrequent, extraordinary works of art that must be
appreciated for what they are. I&#x27;m glad Fight Club has become so highly
regarded and is widely seen for what it is, not just what it appears to
be.
