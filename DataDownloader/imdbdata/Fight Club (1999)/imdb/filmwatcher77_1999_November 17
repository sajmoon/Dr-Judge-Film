1999_November 17 

This film is comparable to such works as Easy Rider giant Giant.  While
these two films protagonists asking &quot;what purpose do I have in this
world?&quot;
The Fight Club asks the same question.  This time the protagonist is us.
The
American male. 28 years old.  Working hard for his things.  That are just
that-things.<br /><br />This film is like getting really drunk.  At first it feels pretty good but
later you feel like death and hurt all over.    In other words, the viewer
easily gets sucked into the void of Norton's character.<br /><br />If you enjoy seven or The Game you will like this film. If NYPD Blues is
too
graphic for you-stay away.
