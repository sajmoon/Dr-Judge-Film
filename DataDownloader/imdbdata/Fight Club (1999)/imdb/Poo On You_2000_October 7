Fight Club is a masterpiece.  Having seen it 5 or 6 times now, I can truly
say I have gotten something new out of it each time.  If you haven't seen
this movie, see it now.  If have seen it, see it again.  This is one of
the
most important movies of the last ten years.  It's also funny as hell the
second time you see it.  The score by the Dust Brothers is truly
fantastic,
and you just can't beat Meat Loaf's best performance ever.
