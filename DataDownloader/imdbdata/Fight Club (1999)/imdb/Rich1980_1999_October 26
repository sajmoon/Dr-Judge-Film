...the Green Mile...probably.
Because of all the issues brought up by Fight Club, the movie of the
year will not be voted movie of the year.  The acting was top notch, most
notably, Edward Norton.  David Fincher has put together a movie that
deserves more business than it's getting.  The ending was probably the most
unpredictable event in cinema this year.  I wasn't that surprised since
Arlington Road, &gt;
