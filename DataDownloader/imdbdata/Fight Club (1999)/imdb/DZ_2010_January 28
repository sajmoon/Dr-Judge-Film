Fight Club is one of the most phenomenal movies of all time and there
are some reasons for that and probably its rating (8.8, if you ask me
extremely excessive) is owing to those reasons. As I see, rather next
generation loves this movie (by the way, I am not that old) What are
these reasons then? Firstly, because it is a criticism of consumer
society. Yes, I am against that too, but this is not enough to make a
movie masterpiece. Secondly, because it is an anarchist movie (like V
for Vendetta which is cinematically not great like Fight Club) and
lastly, I don&#x27;t know before this movie had there been fight clubs or
not, but &#x27;&#x27;fight club&#x27;&#x27; idea excited people&#x27;s attention, people
emulated it, it sounded cool to them. Additionally, it was a
conventional film, so it delivered itself easily to all of its
audiences. Thus, the born of a phenomenal movie. However, Fight Club
was just a good movie if you ask me, it is interesting, the plot is
interesting, everything is interesting, there is Brad Pitt and there is
Edward Norton, another very good actor, but no more than that. As for
David Fincher, he is one of my all time favorite directors, but because
of Seven, The Game and Alien 3 (sorry, yes Alien 3!) Fincher&#x27;s
direction is not flawed in this one, but it is not subtle or masterful
either. And Fight Club has a twist at the end which I believe that it
ruins the movie. In that way, the movie becomes unrealistic a sort of,
to be more precise unconvincing and even pointless. Otherwise, it could
have been a very good dark buddy movie. Therefore, yes I was surprised,
but in a bad way. Seven had a twist, The Game had a twist, but this is
different, because this twist disappointed me seriously. There are some
people who have seen the movie tons of times. I watched it two times
and that was enough for me.
