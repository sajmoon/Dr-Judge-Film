This is completely a different movie. at first you don&#39;t understand
what exactly is going around and what is happening in the movie, you
might really feel bored but as the movie is about to end you will
realize what is exactly about and there comes the real suspense in the
movie and then u will understand why is it named the fight club. people
who don&#39;t understand it for first time, i recommend to watch it for the
second time. Well coming to the story line it is about two persons one
who works for car company and other selling soaps. the first guy is
really frustrated of his life, his usual work and day to day life. once
he meets the sales person and then happen to be friends later on. then
they decide to start a club which is like a street fight and they set
their own rules and regulations. this club further leads to some
dangerous events. i hope every one likes this movie.
