From the astonishing visual style, to its stinging satire of American
culture, never has a movie made me laugh so hard, or drew me in so
completely.
It is said that every generation has a work of art or an artist that
represents the feeling and conflicts of its time.  Fight Club is just such a
movie.  Although considered to be a statement on the impoverishment of white
American males, Fight Club is just as important as any piece of art trying
to portray the sufferings and ailments of a society, culture, or
demographic.  Critics who dismiss the movie as some type of attempt to
portray white males as having problems that they just should not complain
about, simply refuse to be open to the fact that everyone has problems, and
issues that need to be faced.  Fight Club illustrates the issues of its
generation with great clarity.  It is not a matter of agreeing with the
issues.  It is a matter of resolving the problems.
Some of the themes in the movie such as consumerism, loneliness and nihilism
only serve to illustrate the &quot;lost&quot; X generation, and are only means to
illustrating a dead and lifeless society.  What is great about this movie is
it does not provide all the answers.<br /><br />
