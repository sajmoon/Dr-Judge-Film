Fight Club is clearly a testosterone fueled adventure through the<br /><br />life of Edward Norton and his time in the fight club. I was<br /><br />unbearably bored with this film because it was ridiculously long<br /><br />and the Norton/Pitt duo just didn't work for me. I thought that this<br /><br />movie was complete nonsense and would have much rather<br /><br />watched the grass grow instead of this hunk of garbage. If<br /><br />anything, women  will enjoy this movie more than men because of<br /><br />the constant bare chested scenes featuring the sexy Brad Pitty<br /><br />Poo.
