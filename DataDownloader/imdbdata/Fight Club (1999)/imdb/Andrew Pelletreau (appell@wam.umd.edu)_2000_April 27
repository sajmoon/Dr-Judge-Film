Fight Club is bizarre, yet perfectly normal.  It is a movie that's climax
is
everything to the plot, the characters, and the many subtle themes that
permeate the film.  This climax is somewhat confusing and unquestionably
strange, but despite its peculiarity, it has the effect of normalizing the
film.  Edward Norton and Brad Pitt play two young firebrands disillusioned
by the norms of society who start an organization of men like themselves.
It is a club of men who fight each other barehanded and without protection
for recreation.  However, although the fighting is not fueled by hate, it
is
very impassioned and as David Fincher's direction presents, extremely
graphic.  While this fight club serves as the center of the film, there
are
so many other intricate themes in the movie which in the end, prove to be
much more important than the organization.  The complexity of this movie
was
just so engrossing that I had to pause it several times just to ponder how
the themes of the movie were forming.  Edward Norton's character was
extremely complex but entirely believable, despite the peculiarity of his
personality.  Fight Club is a film about how one man searches for freedom
from the norms of his life, how he is alienated by the firm that employs
him
and corporate society in general, how he longs to join or form
organizations
to better his life, and how he realizes how he really enjoys something
that
initially disconcerted him greatly.
This laundry list of themes are only a microcosm of this brilliant film,
which as mentioned in the beginning, is able to blend all of these motifs
with a bizarre climax that normalizes the characters and the point of the
movie.  It is so difficult to describe this movie, and the mental effort
that I put into dissecting the actual story and ending almost makes me
forget how great Norton, Pitt, and Helen Bonham Carter's (Pitt's
girlfriend
in the movie) acting and Fincher's direction is.  You will never see this
type of movie of again because it is magnificent.  Four stars out of
four.
