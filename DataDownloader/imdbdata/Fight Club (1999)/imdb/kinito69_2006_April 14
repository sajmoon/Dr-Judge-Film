I just recently saw fight club and I must say I think that it is one of
the most overrated movies I have ever seen. (Actually, second because
crash is the most overrated, how did that win best picture) All of my
friends talked about how good it was but I always stayed away from this
movie. I did enjoy the fight scenes and in the beginning, I was
captivated by the plot. Things soon begin to come apart. It was really
good until it dipped into the terrorism theme. All of a sudden the
movie switched gears and never recovered. Does this really deserve to
be in top 50? I don&#39;t think so. Brad Pitt was good. Edward was good but
this was not their best. What do you think?
