This is a brilliant movie, it really goes deep inside the decay of
society as Tyler Durden or the people of the U.S. sees it. Every word
he says in his speech about we as middle age men or young adults, have
no great war or no great depression, all of it is true, every word. We
as people living in America right now, we have nothing to look forward
to, maybe somebody&#39;s birth day or Christmas, but what do we really
have. The government has us so tightly bound it is ridiculous, trying
to control everything from wearing seat-belts and the video games we
play to the control of other governments in other countries. This movie
is almost a way to run your life with the whole &quot;its only after we&#39;ve
lost everything that we are free to do anything.&quot; That is my opinion on
this Great movie.
