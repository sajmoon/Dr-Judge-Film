It was great to go see a movie that did not treat the audience
as complete idiots.  The film was a great insight into the male psyche in
America.  All the &quot;Going back to the cave&quot; stuff was brilliant.  I went to
see it with a male friend who found the film &quot;Okay I Suppose&quot; I thought it
was amazing.
