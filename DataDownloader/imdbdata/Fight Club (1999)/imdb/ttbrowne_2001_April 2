2001_April 2 

This film is the one of the worst uses of celluloid I've seen. No plot,
acting by Ed Norton, Brad (I can't act) Pitt, and others off the mark.  It's
just plain lame.  It's herky jerky...the NEW way to make films...just film a
series of crazy mixed up scenes and teenagers dig it.  This can only be
described as a &quot;teenagers angst&quot; film...society's out to get me so form a
fight club to strike back.  Forget this film...unless you're 16 and feeling
bad.
