A modern masterpiece, nothing short of cinematic genius. Saw this movie
first in high school and no other movie, to date, has made the impact
on me that Fight Club has. It&#39;s a philosophically insightful critique
of western society. Not to mention the camera work and dialog are
superb. When I first saw it I didn&#39;t even have to look to find out who
the director was, the lighting simply screamed Fincher. Fincher will
always be one of the best modern directors but this film is undoubtedly
the high point of his career. Rarely does a film come along that truly
pushes the boundaries set by society in the way that this one does.
Already achieving cult status this movie, I have no doubt, will go down
in history as one of the greatest films ever made.
