Perhaps, I myself am not clever or witty enough to give a complete
outline of the context, the &quot;behind scenes&quot; meaning of Fight Club but I
can say that it is the most absorbing movie I have ever seen. I read
the book after the movie made such a impact on me and found it equally
impressive. I suppose it's the idea's of middle class, middle life,
confusion that would appeal to anyone who doesn't know where they are
going. Or maybe that's just bollocks and the film is just stylish and
darkly comic. Or maybe still it's a mixture of the two. <br /><br />The plot is complicated and warrants a second viewing this is due to
the surprises present at varying points of the movie. The disjointed
timeline and superb use of atmosphere make this in my opinion better
than Fincher's &quot;seven&quot; that being a bold statement to make. I'd also
say that Tyler Durden has to be perhaps the most awesome character, and
&quot;Jack&quot; the most uneasily real in a great deal of movies I have seen.<br /><br />In short..watch this movie..it'll be far better than the random babble
of me.
