Alright, we know Fincher makes great movies (with the exception of
Panic Room which is the only blip on an otherwise spotless career) but
movies are a collaboration and this is the finest example. <br /><br />The novel that this was based on is expanded and improved with its
journey to the screen, does this prove that two, three or four writers
are better than one? The direction superb, art direction incredible and
the acting impeccable. <br /><br />Forget about Citizen Kane, there has to be a certain time period before
we can really recognize this movie for the genius that's inside of it.
10 stars.
