I've seen many reviewers here and elsewhere wax poetically about the
greatness of &quot;Fight Club&quot;.  Indeed, the film is one of the most fascinating
visual and aural trips of recent years.  Taking his dark, gritty style seen
in &quot;Seven&quot;, Fincher shows true vision in showing us a different world.  Some
sequences -- the IKEA catalogue come to life, Tyler inserting porn snippets
into a family film, the plane crash -- are brillant little pieces of
filmmaking that take editing, sound design, and image to another level in
Hollywood film.<br /><br />However, it's one of the most emotionally empty films I've seen in quite
some time.  One can compare &quot;Fight Club&quot; to Oliver Stone's &quot;Natural Born
Killers&quot; -- both are commentaries on aspects of contemporary society, both
are violent, and relentless with the viewer.  But, where &quot;Fight Club&quot; fails
is in  the humanity of its characters.  The skill shown in &quot;NBK&quot; is making
caricatures very real people; the failing of &quot;Fight Club&quot; is making anyone
in the film approachable at all.<br /><br />There's only one little glimmer of emotion in the piece, where Pitt and
Norton first duke it out outside a little bar near the beginning of the
film.  If that theme -- guys who can, like big kids, fight and tumble just
for the fun of it -- had been extended a bit further through the formation
of the fight clubs, then showed how the clubs (and Norton's paranoid
fantasy) went in a different direction, the film could have worked a bit
better.<br /><br />In all, &quot;Fight Club&quot; is an unfortunate example of the new breed of Hollywood
directors who have a remarkable sense of visual style, with all the
emotional range and storytelling ability of ... a bar of soap.  I came away
from &quot;Fight Club&quot; feeling as though I had seen the most brilliant and
shallow film of all time.  The film is a two-hour television commercial for
teenage angst in developmentally immature twenty-somethings, Pitt and Norton
transformed into ad spokesman screaming &quot;My Life is So Empty&quot;.  It will
certainly dazzle you, but doesn't have much of a point and is, in the end, a
waste of time.  All I can say to the GenX'ers who liked this film:  grow up.
 To the Hollywood execs that financed and distributed this mess:  stop
assuming that your audience has the intellectually capacity of a
flea.
