In an environment where so many movies seem to have been formulated
entirely by the marketing department, a movie that even tries to tell a
story and express fairly sophisticated ideas is already above average,
even if it doesn't do everything right.<br /><br />'Fight Club' contains some fun social satire, mocking corporate
doublespeak and the culture of 'recovery.' It also contains a portrait
of a kind of fascism that is quite reminiscent of the followers of
Mussolini, with their anti-rationalism and their cult of action and
virility. The movie has a sense of humor on occasion, and a central
puzzle that keeps the viewer scrambling to put the pieces together.<br /><br />On the other hand, it also glorifies the culture of violence that it
purports to critique. The commentary track on the DVD shows that the
filmmakers are blind to this: did they ask themselves whether their
scathing attack on &quot;frat boys who take themselves too seriously and
shave their heads&quot; was actually presented in such a way as to appeal to
said frat boys? Are the endless scenes of men beating each other up
necessary to make a point? I quickly started to find them tedious, and
began to wonder for whose benefit they were being offered.
