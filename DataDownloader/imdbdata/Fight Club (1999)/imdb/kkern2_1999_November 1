1999_November 1 

I have just returned from seeing &quot;Fight Club&quot; and I must admit I haven't the
words right now, but I will try. I really enjoyed &quot;Fight Club&quot;; the
violence, the humor, the thought-provoking dialogue-but, only one complaint.
The &quot;plot twist&quot; as you may call it really cramped the movie's style. I
thought the movie was way too sophisticated to resort to some sort of
gimmick. Maybe I am missing the point the twist was trying to make about
some aspect of humanity-I don't know. All I know is my first reaction to
that twist was disappointment and confusion. I know if I sat here long
enough and really thought about the meaning of it all, I would think that we
as humans could very well end up trying to be something that we are not and
do things that we may not normally do, as the character did in this movie. I
would definitely recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys a really decent
dry wit and a plot that, even if it does throw you for a loop, makes you
think about our society and our compliance of living a materialistic,
ritualistic life with no surprises.
