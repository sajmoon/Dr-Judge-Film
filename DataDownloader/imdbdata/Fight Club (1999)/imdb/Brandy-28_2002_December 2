I don't know if I'm finally loosing it or not, but when I first saw this
movie - the final flash scene after the credits was the male crotch of
someone.  It was just a quick flash.  I thought it was Brad Pitt, because it
had that nice V shape to it and we all know how Brad Pitt has that V at his
stomach leading to places of pleasure.<br /><br />Did anyone else see this - or was this just wishful thinking on my part.  I
want to rent the movie so I can slow mo it and check it
out.<br /><br />Come on people - send me a message and let me know.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />Oh and by the way - this movie is fantastic
