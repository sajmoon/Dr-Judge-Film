this is a film that i knew was going to be good going into the theatre
(The
Movie Show giving it 4 1/2 &amp; 5) &amp; it didn't let me down. it hits you for 6
basically and for all you people out there who don't get cricket - it's a
homerun in baseball this movie!! i don't know who i like better Pitt or
Norton, they are both so good in this. Although Norton had the screen all
to
himself in &quot;American History X &quot; .
the best film i saw in 1999. Do yourself a really big favour &amp; see it if
you
haven't - you won't be disappointed!!
