&#39;Fight Club&#39; is a movie of a rare caliber, one that makes its points
unrestrainedly, its characters dominate the screen with vivacious
personalities. It has a dream-like quality to it, but it is
excruciatingly real. A reality that gets uglier and more twisted until
its stunning ending. Love it or hate it, it&#39;s a movie you will not soon
forget.<br /><br />Edward Norton&#39;s character, who narrates throughout the film, is a
depressed fellow with a dead-beat job, an insomniac who finds his only
pleasures in attending support groups for the terminally ill. His life
takes an unexpected turn when he meets Marla, a woman who finds herself
in similar straits.<br /><br />Enter Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt): A young, clever and energetic guy, an
activist who rants against the evils of our consumer-driven society.
Their obvious differences notwithstanding, our narrator and Tyler
strike up a strange friendship.<br /><br />Things remain on the relatively down-low, until out of the clear blue,
Tyler tells his pal &#39;hit me!&#39;. After they begin brawling randomly to
release their natural pent-up aggression, the idea catches on, and they
formally found &#39;Fight Club&#39;, a club that lets men be men without the
artificial influences of consumerism, or the superficial effects of
conformist society.<br /><br />But as &#39;Fight Club&#39; gains popularity and begins to spread throughout
the country, problems begin creeping up, both within Fight Club and in
the personal lives of our narrator and his on-and-off girlfriend Marla.<br /><br />I think many critics were too creeped out by the dark and violent
aspects of this movie, to give it its deserved due for its
thought-provoking and intelligent script. Not to mention, its
phenomenal acting, which aside from the great performance we expect out
of Ed Norton who seems to thrive in these kind-of &#39;dark&#39; roles, Brad
Pitt establishes himself as a truly good actor (not just a &#39;pretty
boy&#39;) and is just so ideal for the character of Tyler Durden.<br /><br />Unless you&#39;re extremely averse to dark and violent movies, this is a
must-see for its unique and uninhibited storyline and extraordinary
characters. It has an ending that matches those of The Sixth Sense and
The Usual Suspects. Its thought-provoking ideas and concepts will be
further enlightened after multiple viewings. Not to be missed.
