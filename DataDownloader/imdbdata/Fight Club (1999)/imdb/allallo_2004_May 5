Fight Club is one of my favorite movies. I've seen it couple of times... I
also own the DVD. Don't miss the alternative (subliminal) FBI warning by
Durden when the DVD starts ;) Anyways, I don't want to give too many
details
and ruin the appetite of those who haven't seen this master
piece.<br /><br />What makes this movie so amazing is the story ofcourse. It's based on
Chuck
Palahniuk's novel.
and it's about... well... Our controlled way of life, searching
satisfaction
in materialistic things, Money, loneliness, NO SEX, NO SATISFACTION,
ShXXty
daily Jobs, getting stock in a small apartment filled with things from an
Ikea catalogue, SEX but no happiness, No Money, No Home etc. etc. There
are
zillions of things that we are wasting our lives on, are these really
important for us? Do we really need all the things that we buy? things...
things... the things that make us angry...  the things that we hate... the
things that we want... the people that we envy... the people that we wanna
be... the things that make us SICK to the stomache... the people that
makes
us angry, the people that we hate... But there's SOMEONE THAT WE ALL HATE
MOST... Do you know who that is?
Well, this movie not only answers that, but it also slaps you right in the
face with that answer...<br /><br />David Fincher did an excellent job directing it. Ed Norton became one of
my
favorite actors after I've seen his acting in this movie (I've probably
seen
all of his movies after this one). He's simply amazing... Brad Pitt also
proves that he's a great actor, not just a baby face sex symbol.<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter... well, I can't imagine Fight Club without her, or
any
other actress playing her role...<br /><br />BUF Compagnie (Paris, FR), Blue Sky Studios (New York, US) and Digital
Domain (CA, US) created the CG and Special Effects Art work in Fight Club.
Yes these 3 great, award winning companies worked together in this movie.
And their amazing art work is what makes the Fight Club so visually
pleasing
and rich... The famous Ikea scene is fantastic, but there's even more...
since the CG work is perfectly blended in, you need to pay more attention
to
realize that there's actually lot of CG work in this movie -perhaps you
may
have to watch the movie couple times ;)-.<br /><br />Don't miss this movie...
