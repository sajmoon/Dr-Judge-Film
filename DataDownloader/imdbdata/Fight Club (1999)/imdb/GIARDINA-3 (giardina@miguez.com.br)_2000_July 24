This movie tries to pass itself as an art movie but it never is. When &quot;Pulp
Fiction&quot;, for example, was a very clever film, in spite of being a violent
one, &quot;Fight Club&quot; is only annoying and sometimes boring. Edward Norton,
though, is superb, as always, and he is the only reason why I did not turned
my VCR off. It is quite surprising how well he can act - he is truly the
best American young actor of our time.
