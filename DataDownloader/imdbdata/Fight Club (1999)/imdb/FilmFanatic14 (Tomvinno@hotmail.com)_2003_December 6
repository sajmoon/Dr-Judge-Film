Where to begin? I loved Fight Club, along with many other people, and I
would recommend it to anyone who has an 'open mind' and does not get
offended easily. Fight Club had a dark feel, with very black comedy and a
touch of mystery.<br /><br />Fight Club is about one man's journey through a weird part of his life.
He
(Edward Norton) has a good job working for a car company, he has nice
IKEA
furniture in his nice little condo. He was almost a complete man. Until,
his
condo explodes while he is away and he looses everything he owned. So, he
rings Tyler (Brad Pitt), an acquaintance he made on a plane on one of his
business trips. He goes and has a few beers with Tyler. After they finish
they come out of the pub and Tyler asks him to hit him as hard as he can.
After some hesitance he does, Tyler hits him back and they fight the
night
away. They get a buzz from fighting and that's how Fight Club starts. I
won't give anything away but the story twists and turns ways you could
never
imagine.<br /><br />What made Fight Club so great was a combination of many different people
doing a great job.  The novel buy Chuck Palahniuk was brilliant and I
personally thought that it could never be brought to the screen and be as
good as the book. But, Fight Club exceeded its limits and went a step
further with a great screenplay by Jim Uhls, without the great screenplay
the film would have flopped. Then there is the extraordinary acting all
around, it was undoubtedly Edward Norton's, Helena Bonham Carter's and
Brad
Pitt's best performance ever and other small roles were played well too,
such as Meat Loaf, playing Bob. And of coarse, last but not least, David
Fincher. David exceeded all expectations making Fight Club. The film was
given the prefect feeling thanks to David's precise direction, if you
listen
to the commentary and see all the extra features on the DVD you will be
sure
to know how much effort David put into Fight Club to give it the perfect
feel, just like the book.<br /><br />Overall, Fight Club gives us some very strong messages, but I thing the
very
essence of the film is to take what you want from it. This is a must see
for
everyone, because in my opinion this is the best film ever made and you
will
most probably enjoy it. If you don't like it, watch it a second time, it
will likely change you opinion. A definite: 10/10
