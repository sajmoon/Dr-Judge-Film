Well, I'll have to take a breath before trying to comment this movie.
Because it's beyond doubt one of the movies I've been most entertained
by ever. I don't know how many times I've seen it. There's just so many
details in this film, that it's long lasting.<br /><br />.....and by the way, anyone who don't get this movie, watch it once
more. Because I had to watch it about three times before I really got
the whole thing, that's just how brilliant this movie is.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for entertainment, don't wait, watch it!! But I
should also warn the tender hearted :p You will have to have a bit of a
dark sense of humor to get it!
