now you have to realise the true potential of the underdog.
this film does and doesnt demand that you look for the deeper
meaning,
it has such a versitile appeal that if you lack in brain power there is
still something there that will blow your mind ..
i am a matrix fan also but you sometimes find yourself digging and
clutching
onto the idea that someone has finally nailed it,
but fight club puts a deck of a mixture of aces and jokers and its up to
you
to take your pick on the different angles global and local (inside and
out)
of the mind and more of what seems to be extreme in the world..it has a
specific black comedy side but by no means lightens the views and goals of
this genius movie...
