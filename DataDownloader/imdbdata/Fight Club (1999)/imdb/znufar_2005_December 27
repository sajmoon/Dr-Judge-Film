l have seen the movie, and skipped the end (l was TOLD that it is the
most important part, and they also told me what it was). l just
couldn't stand it. l know l have to see it again someday in order to
have an idea about the full piece, but l just find it repellent...<br /><br />l think it is violent beyond any good taste, and nothing justifies it -
the end is not important, not strong enough, and not worthy sitting for
so long, watching something l can see if l open my news on TV. when l
saw it, it was broadcasted with no censorship (&quot;+13&quot;, for example), and
beyond the fact l had no idea what l am about to see, l could have
entered to this movie with my little brother, who is too young and
cannot filter it.<br /><br />l heard opinions that were fascinated by the philosophic side - the
&quot;philosophy&quot; in it can be compared to Paulo Coalo's and Richard Bach's
literature - not very deep, very commercialized, and it forced you to
see things that you are not aware to their influence on you in the
process.
