I found that Fight Club was completely original, so to speak. When it
came
out, movies were being made that were redone, based on, and quite similar
to
movies and plots that have already been done. All they added was a new
explosion here and there, gun fights, and the occasional babe. Well Fight
Club was quite original in the fact that the twist is the guy's a psycho,
and he started some cult that pulls pranks and beat on each other to a
bloody pulp.
