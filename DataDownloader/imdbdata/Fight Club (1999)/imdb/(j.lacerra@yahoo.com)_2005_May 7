2005_May 7 
Having seen this movie over a year ago, all I can remember about it is
thinking it one of the worst movies I have ever seen (and I've seen a
LOT of movies). I was quite surprised to see it in the Top 250, and
thought of so highly by reviewers on this site. It made so little an
impression on me that I cannot remember one solitary scene or player in
it, although I read here that Brad Pitt participated with someone
called Ed Norton (Honeymooners?). All I remember is that it pained me
to watch the whole thing, but I did. I don't know why. But just in case
many of you are holding back your true dislike of this piece of trash
because it is just sooo PC to like it, well now the ice is broken.<br /><br />There is no accounting for taste!
