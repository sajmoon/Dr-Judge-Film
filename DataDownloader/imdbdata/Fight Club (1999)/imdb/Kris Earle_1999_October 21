David Fincher's least entertaining film to date: about on par with alien3,
with alien3 being the movie I'll see again before this garbage. A very angry
movie and very hostile.. a few people I know said that if you love Fincher
you'll love this movie -- not the case. Pitt and Norton are good.. but at
the point where Tyler builds &quot;operation mayhem&quot; it gets ridiculous. The
&quot;trick&quot; third act that redefines the whole movie didn't bother me at all,
but at that point it couldn't save itself. A 7 out of 10 -- a 70, C-, less
than average. Wish they trimmed the movie as much as they showed
liposuctioned fat trickling off the barbwire. Ick.
