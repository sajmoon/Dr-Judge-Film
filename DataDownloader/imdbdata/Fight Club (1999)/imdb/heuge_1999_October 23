1999_October 23 

Well this movie won week one in the ratings, and I just watched it in week
2
at the biggest theatre complex in the area.  We went to a 7PM showing, and
we were in the largest projection room in the complex, but there were only
10 people.<br /><br />Never fear, the movie was an excellent ride even without a massive
audience.
Some of the people just did not seem to understand the tone of the movie
as
my friend and I were laughing with the rest of the room stayed in silence.
I sincerely hope that enough individuals treat this movie as a medium-deep
thrill ride as opposed to social commentary.<br /><br />The narrarator's perspective was also quite excellently done, and combined
plot elements well.  I must admit that Fincher is an impressive director.
While much credit must be given to the original material and the
screenplay,
be sure that I look forward to Mr. Fincher's future work.
