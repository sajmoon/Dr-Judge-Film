A woman needs to speak up for Helena Bonham Carter&#39;s incredible acting
performance in this movie. Because it&#39;s guys who post for the film
she&#39;s been overlooked because no man can relate to how anti-female this
woman is and how far from the real Helena. Women who can treat random
sex and despicable grunge as a natural and casual form of life have
gone off the path somewhere and this girl isn&#39;t looking for redemption.
She embraces the strange as normal and rejects the comfortable and
pretty as the aberrations. Few other actresses could have achieved the
level of intense hyperactivity and abandon Helena captures here. So
much so that she sinks into the movie like a dead body into a sewer and
has been ignored on these boards thus far.
