1999_November 5 

My opinion?  One of the best movies this year.  And I've seen them all.
Even the Haunting.  The shared acting of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt was
visually stunning and left me entertained for hours afterwards.  If bloody
fistfights are not your thing then this is definitely not the film for
you.
