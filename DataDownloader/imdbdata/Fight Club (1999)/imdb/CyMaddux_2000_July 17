   A good idea, and good performance by Norton who is always solid, but this
movie just contains too many inconsistencies and impossible acts that don't
fit along with the plot.<br /><br />   Not one of Pitt's best performances, but if nothing else, watch it for
the performance of Norton and the interesting but flawed
storyline.<br /><br />
