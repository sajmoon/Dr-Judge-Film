I wasn't one of the privileged few who got to watch this movie in the
theaters. But when I started watching the movie I understood that this is
not a movie for personal entertainment, or taking your girlfriend to,
this
is a movie for self improvement (or destruction) and is relative to many
ordinary peoples' lives. I always say that this movie is my Bible, and I
always mean it. To me, religion is partly an everyday relation to your
life,
like this movie. Fight Club is in truth, not about fighting, it is about
salvation.<br /><br />Tyler Durden is a anarchist who's got it all figured out. His idea of the
perfect system is one in complete chaos, the exact opposite of todays
organized, boxed up corporate world. The main character of this film,
however, is just your ordinary &quot;Jack&quot;. He lives in an apartment, works in
a
cubicle, and suffers from insomnia. But somehow, amidst all of his hard
earned valuable possesions, he is lost. Lost in the fact that the world
is a
dream to him, and he is slowly waking up. When he awakes, he meets Tyler,
and a chain of events causes &quot;Jack&quot; to shack up with him. Living in the
dump
that is Tyler's home, the two create a form of therapy that they call
Fight
Club. It is not so much a club as a way of spreading Tyler's philosophy
and
views to the world.<br /><br />When Fight Club gets out of hand, &quot;Jack&quot; is stuck fighting against the
destruction of the system he has known for so long, and the disturbing
fact
that there is method to Tyler's madness.<br /><br />In conclusion, this movie is one for the audience who can relate to the
fact
that everyday life in this &quot;modern&quot; age is depleting the human spirit and
vitality. It is a movie for someone seeking something above and beyond
the
safety of our system, and striving to change it. Unlike the trailers,
this
movie is limited to about four graphic fight scenes, which hold
significant
plot points, but not so much action at all. For the thrill seeking critic
who demands action and destruction over an intricate plot, THIS MOVIE
ISN'T
FOR YOU. 10*/10*
