1999_December 30 

I have never seen a film before that plays this good with the
story , reality and fiction. Seeing this movie for the first time one might
admit that it is not too easy to understand the whole plot from the
beginning , but in fact every little comment that any of the characters
makes in the movie , fits into the the story as a whole perfectly. Not to
forget about the absolutely brilliant pictures! Wonderful movie!
