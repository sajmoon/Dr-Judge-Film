the first half of this chaotic flick was some of the best filmmaking i saw
last year and all the actors and actresses were perfectly cast (and yes
Meatloaf delivers a suprisingly solid perfomance). 
BUT, during a critical plot twist, the movie begins a steady spiral into
redundancy that completely pulls the rug out from the brilliant first half.
the ending also has to be mentioned as being one of the worst and most
contrived that i have seen in recent memory.<br /><br />it's kind of sad really. i've read the book this movie was based on and was
stoked to hear it was being filmed, but the movie disappointed me and i left
the theater feeling burnt.<br /><br />
