This is what I say to people that bash this movie. A movie this
Incredible,
Deep and Revolutionary isn't easily understood by those conditioned by
society. The movie is about fighting the path blazed by the content. It
inspires one to realize the world goes on whether they do or not. &quot;You are
not your f**king khaki's&quot;. Your bible shouldn't be the IKEA catalog. Life
is
Darwinism, you fight for survival. Returning to primal state. Starting at
scratch. No credit cards, No boutiques, No Bmw's or Benz's, No computers.
Just man the way he was meant to be before he learned to use tools. The
fighting shows primitive man hood. No lawyers, No police, No mommy to hide
behind. The womanizing is a great way to show cavemanesque traits.
Surprise,
it got a lot of lesbian bashing for the womanizing and the really
&quot;romantic&quot;
treatment of Marla. This movie is supposed to be controversial, it is
suppose to piss people off, it goes against every thing Maxim, MTV, and
Cosmo has tried to imbue your brain with since you were cognitive of
society's standard of &quot;Make as much money as possible or else you are
worthless!!&quot;
In a fight it doesn't matter that you were a Rolex. It doesn't matter you
know the names of all of he nsync members. It doesn't matter that you were
dkny shoes. All that matter is can you go on. Period. It is an amazing eye
opener.<br /><br />My friends and I came to an interesting conclusion on why the movie was
so
unpopular. &quot;It was too violent for intellectuals and to smart for people
that like &quot;splosion&quot; movies.&quot; Why rent a movie that makes you think when
you
can turn your brain off and watch &quot;Bring it on&quot;.
I can understand when people say the didn't like a movie but to bash a
movie
you don't understand is just ignorant and robs those that trust your
provincial opinion of seeing great cinema.
