The first rule of Fight Club is do not talk about Fight Club.  This is one
rule that you have to break.  This movie in incredibly original.  A great
story, great acting, and a lot of fighting/violence.  This is one movie in
which you have to see.  Probably the best movie of 1999.  You will not be
disappointed.
