The first time watching &quot;Fight Club&quot;, you may be confronted not
necessarily by the violence, but by the freshness of language, imagery
&amp; sounds that smack your senses &amp; reach your inner most thoughts.<br /><br />Having now seen it many times, I see it from a new perspective each
time &amp; this is thanks, in part, to both Edward Norton &amp; Helena
Bonham-Carter. This film reflects the career path they have both chosen
to take; far from run of the mill &amp; definitely brilliant.<br /><br />David Fincher is a director who has the ability to create visually
stunning films and at the same time play on raw, human emotions. In a
world where violence inflicted on others is promoted in the media as a
way to increase audience ratings figures, &quot;Fight Club&quot; is a refreshing
change. Perhaps if we start feeling again &amp; realize our own failings &amp;
accept ourselves as we are instead of trying to be Mr or Miss Perfect,
then maybe we'll be more accepting of others as well.
