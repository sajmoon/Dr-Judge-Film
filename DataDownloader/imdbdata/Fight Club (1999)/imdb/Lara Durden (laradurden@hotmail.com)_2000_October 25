This movie, like many other Fincher film&#39;s, leave me with a
restlessness. Like someone is actively taking my life away from me. If
I don&#39;t stand up and claim it and DO SOMETHING with it than I might as
well be dead. There is no greater love story than this one. A perfect
film. <br /><br />The first 30 minutes of the film sets up life as it is. As we accept
it. One man tries to find a place in the world. What subjects himself
to is no longer living a full, happy, honest life. Tyler, the great
savior, shows us the way it ought to be. And what we can become. <br /><br />I asked back in 2000 &quot;Question this: In 5 years see how many people
will be talking about The Sixth Sense and then ask who has ever heard
of the genius..........Tyler Durden.&quot; ;) Seriously. This movie still
reigns as the GOD of all that is cool and disposable.
