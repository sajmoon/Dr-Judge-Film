This is one of those movies that people either seem to love or hate.   I
loved it.  The ride was fun, and the ending didn't let me down one bit.
In
fact, it's one of the best endings I've ever seen.  Edward Norton does
another fantastic job, and Brad Pitt never looked better ;).  I was
smiling
(and often giggling) the whole way through.  SEE IT!!!<br /><br />
