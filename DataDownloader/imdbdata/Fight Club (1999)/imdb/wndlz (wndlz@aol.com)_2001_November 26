Fine acting by Ed Norton and Brad Pitt. This film should have been noticed;
but once again many critics slept through this one; were too stupid to
understand it, or are part of the 'Oh! another chance to hammer Brad Pitt
club. I have respect for the critics who saw the same film I saw. It was
very bloody. It was very dark and complex. The actors faced real challenges
here, and I think they were magnificent. The performances as a whole, were
understated, and believable. Sure Jack Nicholson and Anthony Hopkins are
powerful performers; but the quality of a film need not rest on some over
the top and frequently 'hammy' performance. If this films had been a
foreign
export, and Brad Pitt had been an unknown; then perhaps many critics would
have been more objective. To movie lovers everywhere, there are still great
films being made; don't depend on a film critic to lead you to them.<br /><br />Many film critics have forgotten what movies are all about. Too bad for
Hollywood and movie lovers, all over the world. The most famous critics,
reach their esteemed heights, for their scathing, ego driven reviews. They
seem to single out certain performers to ruin. The most attractive
performers have to fight an uphill battle to win a decent review. Critics
should be reviewed by their employers, on a regular basis. The movie-going
public should be part of this process; then possibly we can get rid of some
of these pompous, self-indulgent pedants.
