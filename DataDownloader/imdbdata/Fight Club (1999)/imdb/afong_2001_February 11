No one, and I mean NO ONE can convince me that this film is better than
Wolfgang Petersen's DAS BOOT.  Absolutely ridiculous that users have given
this trite piece of trendy garbage a better review. . .I challenge anyone
to
view both movies back to back and conclude anything except that DAS BOOT is
the superior film!<br /><br />The actual film seems to be a bland variation of two Terry Gilliam films,
&quot;12 monkeys&quot; and &quot;Brazil&quot;, which both did the theme of dystopia much
better,
thank you.  I won't give anything away because there really isn't anything
to GIVE AWAY!  The film is a pleasant little time waster but certainly
nothing more than that.<br /><br />There are no cinematic breakthroughs, no ground breaking social commentary.
The acting by Edward Norton is fine, but Brad Pitt seems to be recycling
his
roles from other movies.  Helena Bonham Carter vamps up the screen for a
while, but has a disposable role.  The film is filled with cameos that
camouflage the fact that the main characters are not as interesting as we'd
be led to believe.<br /><br />The final plot twist left me saying, &quot;so what&quot;, and now that I've seen the
opinions of other users, I'm going to rewatch Gilliam's films to see how it
SHOULD have been done.
