This movie stars Edward Norton and Brad Pitt as two men who start an
underground fighting league and escalates into lots of crime. Norton
has his apartment room burn down and moves into a crappy house with
Pitt.<br /><br />Norton&#39;s life is completely turned upside down when a crack addict
(Helen Habona Carter)enters his life. The two men get several people to
help them because they are convinced that god does not like them. The
movie is directed by David Fichner who also directed Seven. Norton
gives the best performance of his career and Pitt&#39;s is really good. If
you haven&#39;y seen it yet then go see it now!
