I think Fight Club is the most misunderstood movie of all time.  Many people
think it teaches anarchy.  While, I admit the movie is violent, it is
realistic.  That is what fights look like.  In movies, fights seem like
easy, bloodless things where punches make loud noises which in real life
don't happen.  On the anarchy thing, this movie reminds me of George
Orwell's 1984.  The movie is not, repeat, is NOT to be taken literally.  The
theme of the movie is not to do any of the things done in the movie.  It
teaches not to be a follower, or in Tyler's terms, a space monkey.  Also,
the movie, as far as the twist ending, is highly possible. It does take some
understanding of human psychology, but just think of Psycho if you can't
figure it out.
While the critics hated this movie, I'm sure this will make a comeback and
those same critics will add it to their top 10 lists.
