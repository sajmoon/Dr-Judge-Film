 alright, first off many movies are very good and leave you pleased and
satisfied but this film (like all of david Finchers films.) went beyond
that. It made you think and for me changed the way i act or think about
things. I think david Fincher is the best director and no matter what since
he did se7en (the second best movie ever) he has had a twist and something
else that makes each of his films &quot;interesting&quot;. This one went above
interesting. It had useful information as well as much action and twists and
thrills. this movies captivated me from start to end and totally blew me
away. I was underage for this dubbed &quot;adult&quot; film. i am 15 and this is by
far my favourite movie ever. The only thing is, since se7en Fincher has made
each film better than the last. I do not know how he will ever top this one
though. This is a masterpiece and if you do not see it you are missing out
on the movie event of the century. It ois in every way possible
&quot;amazing&quot;<br /><br />**********(10) out of 10
