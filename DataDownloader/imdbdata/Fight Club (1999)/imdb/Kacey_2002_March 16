Wow.  Everyone has said most of the things I wanted to say about Fight Club.
 There isn't really much left to say.  I just wanted to add a few of my own
opinions about the movie before I go.  Violence... violence... and more
violence.  But that's okay.  It's supposed to be disturbing.  It's supposed
to be violent.  That's what makes this movie one of the best movies out
there.  It's supposed to be controversial, and that is just what it is.  And
that's what makes it a real movie.  And anyone who tells you this movie
isn't worth seeing must not have been paying much attention to the
movie.
