&quot;Fight Club&quot; is a very good movie, but it is held up much higher than it
deserves to be.  It currently ranks at #33 on the IMDb top 250, so you can
understand why my mind was blown when an IMDb user actually called this
movie &quot;underappreciated&quot;.  The truth is that it's OVERappreciated.  &quot;Fight
Club&quot; is not the groundbreaking, sensational work of genius many fans call
it.  There aren't any stagerringly original ideas, apart from Fight Club
itself.  The film is pointlessly overlong, with a ridiculous ending that was
not at all needed.  So I see no reason why anyone would ever think that this
movie was underappreciated.  It's obviously not the case.  However, it is
superbly directed, well-written, and well-acted, so I fell good giving it a
rating of 7/10.
