Very intriguing, exciting, gripping movie.  however, i didn't like the
ending... too warped.  they could have done something better with it. <br /><br />all the characters were played well.  i really liked edward norton in here. 
i've seen some movies with him in it, but never really noticed him before. <br /><br />i'm glad i finally saw the movie... but it's not one of my favorites.
