The movie was, in some ways, quite different from the book.  And better in
some ways.  Worse in others.  I just re-read the book to clarify my memory
of it and I can't say that either one was better than the other.  Just
different.  The book certainly makes some things clearer, the movie makes
some things more amusing or exciting.  I guess I'll just have to continue
to
recommend both to people.
