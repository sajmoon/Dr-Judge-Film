Fight Club is the most brilliant movie I have ever laid my eyes upon. Every
little detail that the audience sees ends up meaning something later on.
The
first time through was great because of the awesome ending, and each
additional time I watched it was even greater because I started noticing
all
the little things that lead up to the big thing in the end. What a great
film!
