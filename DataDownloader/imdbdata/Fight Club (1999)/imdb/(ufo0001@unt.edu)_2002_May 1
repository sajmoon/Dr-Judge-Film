Pros: Cinematography, Directing, acting, memorable characters,
Humor.<br /><br />Cons: Gets a bit too incredulous, violent.<br /><br />Fight club represents what will happen if anarchy is prevalent in our
society. Thankfully this situation doesn't happen in real life. Ed Norton
plays an insomniac who tries to get closure by attending Help groups such as
AA even though he doesn't have any of the diseases the member of the groups
have. Helena Bonham Carter disrupts his life when she does the same thing he
is doing. Unable to go on with her hanging around, he and his alter-ego
(Brad Pitt) decide to form Fight Club, a club for men who are fed up with
thier lives. The club soon graduates to weekly boxing matches to terrorist
activities and eventually gets too big for Norton to control. One of the
best movies of 1999, Fight club is a satire on society that is both brutal
and true in its findings. <br /><br />Premise: An insomniac finds escape through fight club.<br /><br />Fight club was nominated for a sole Academy award.<br /><br />Grade: 9.1/10 (Fincher's second best).
