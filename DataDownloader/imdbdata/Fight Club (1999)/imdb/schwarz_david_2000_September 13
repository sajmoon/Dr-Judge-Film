Kill whomever marketed this film.  This is an extraordinarily smart
picture,
but the advertising makes it seem like Rocky 9.  The acting, writing, and
direction is superb... too bad only one silly line was shown in the
commercials.  This is one of the best films made recently, along with BEING
JOHN MALKOVICH.
