Fight Club is a film I went to see reluctantly in the cinema.  I actually
quite enjoy martial arts films done well but out-and-out macho celebrations
(Rambo etc) leave me dry. It was only nudges from other people that
persuaded me to try it shortly before the end of it's screen
run...<br /><br />And how wrong I was. Fight Club is a deep, complicated (the film basically
cannot be understood the first time you see it) exploration of alienation
and identity of one individual in particular. It is packed with dense,
clever dialogue - and a dry, witty narration fills the gaps between the
agruments, speackes and face offs. The film runs 2h20m but has more
freeze-frame detail than The Simpsons.<br /><br />The real theme of Fight Club is being unhappy in life, and exploring
alternatives to an empty existence. The central character (played Edward
Norton) both stars and narrates as one such individual, who's life is turned
around when he meets the charismatic, assertive soad salesman Tyler Durden
(Brad Pitt) who leads him, and others, on a mission to &quot;hit the bottom&quot;. The
first of these is the titualar Fight Club, which is more about giving and
(in particular) revieving pain than winning. The narrator's spiral is
complemented by the depressive Marla Singer (Helena Bonham-Carter), and the
three become entwined in a _very_ complicated relationship.<br /><br />It's hard to talk about the themes in Fight Club without spoiling it, but I
would recommend it to anyone capable of absorbing ideas or observations
critically (i.e. without big &quot;this is right/wrong&quot; signs over it) and the
violent scenes, although rare, are realistic (no martial arts/superhero
stuff, just knuckes &amp; blood) so the feint harted 
should stay away.<br /><br />The film will change your life. You may not quit your job or get in a fight,
but you will never use expensive soap or take electrical goods on a plane.
And you will ALWAYS worry about your sleep paterns.
