1999_November 1 

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the film. But on it's second viewing I
started
to question the content behind the stunning art direction and the ever
brilliant direction. I started to think that this film was targeted towards
the 15 - 25 year old males out there that are struggling to find themselves
in this world, MEN-X if you will. Not that that's a bad sector, who says
any
other demographic has found themselves, and certainly the social messages
that the film is addressing pertain to every one of us.<br /><br />But...<br /><br />If this film is indeed targeting that specific group, young men, then what
can be said about how the film portrays their would be female partners?
Certainly Helen Bonham Carter's character is just as screwed up as Edward
Norton's but we never delve into how she tries to resolve things. She is
merely the punching bag for his characters emotional outburts, his lust,
his
basest desires and tirades. She comes back to him time and again though he
treats her with no respect. Is that the best message around? Certainly she
states that he is 'the worst thing to ever happen to her' but Nortons
character laments the fact that he hadn't gone to watch her die, which of
these is the stronger statement and which is the audience lead to
sympathize
with? The latter of course.<br /><br />Looking back on Fincher's other films, all of which I have loved and count
'Se7en' as one of my all time favorites, I have to say I am a little
disturbed about his portrayal of women. Certainly Sigourney Weaver was a
strong character but that was a franchise film that was based on Ripley
being a strong character. Then we have Gwenyth in 'Se7en'. The sad
powerless
howsewife whose brutal death leads to the Pitt's main characters ultimate
confrontation. In the game the lead female is certainly part of the 'crew'
but when we meet her she is playing the role of a waitress. Her character
does possess some bravado but she never the less is relegated to a
subservient role in the film.<br /><br />Now, I'm certainly not calling Fincher a misogynist, and I'm definitely not
trying to create a feminists 'operation mayhem' against this brilliant
directors work. I just find it a little distressing that a director as in
touch with the psyche of the times as David Fincher is can, in one of the
best films of the year, portray a woman with a 1950's sentiment.<br /><br />Again, I loved the direction and art direction of this film. I think David
Fincher is one of the most creative directors working today. It's just that
in this film, a film that is destined to be viewed as a rallying point for
allot of young men, he grossly abused his female character, to the
detriment
of all of us who truly admire his work.
