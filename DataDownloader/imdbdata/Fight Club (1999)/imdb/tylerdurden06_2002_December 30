What can i say. A++. ==mindchanging=&gt; In my opinion, this movie has one of the best endings in filmhistory
(Near
Death Experience) besides the endings in Fearless, Jacobs Ladder, 12
Monkeys, The Game, Baraka, etc...<br /><br />Made by a genius with the intension to develop the human spirit in our
world.<br /><br />&quot;We work at jobs we hate to buy things we don't need.&quot;
&quot;It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do
anything.&quot;<br /><br />
