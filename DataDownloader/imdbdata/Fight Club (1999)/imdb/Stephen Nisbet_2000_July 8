Outlaw freedom of speech. Kill the dissident voices. Suffocate satire. It
is
too dangerous to let the masses think for themselves. The Nazi's thought
so.
So do the morally righteous conservative authorities who tell us all that
is
wrong about FIGHT CLUB.<br /><br />Is the film dangerous? I guess. It is ambiguous, satirical, and
self-consciously cool. Does that make it bad? Of course not. The film
condemns materialistic narcissism as much as AMERICAN BEAUTY. However,
FIGHT
CLUB is funnier, angrier, and it sticks to its guns.<br /><br />The allusion to fascism is loud and clear, people are upset at the light in
which the FIGHT CLUB is painted, the lack of outward condemnation. The
violence hurts. But the men consent to it, they need to feel something. It
transpires, of course, to be a false dawn.<br /><br />Alexander Walker didn't like the unpleasant overtones. Which is strange,
because the film FIGHT CLUB most resembles was directed by his old chum,
Stanley Kubrick. Fincher's film bears more than a passing nod to the
mischievous mayhem of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. In both cases the malevolent
satire was a guilty pleasure.<br /><br />With it's kinetic, hypnotic visual style, Fincher's film is style and
substance mixed perfectly. That it connects with an audience (most likely
young male) is because it is an astutely written product of it's
environment. Generation terrorism never looked so good.<br /><br />
