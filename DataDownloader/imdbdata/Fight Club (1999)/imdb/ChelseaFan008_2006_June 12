It&#39;s hard to think of any film that&#39;s left an impression on me as much
as Fight Club has. David Fincher&#39;s adaptation of Chuck Palahnuik&#39;s
slightly above average story comes leaps and bounds ahead of the
simplistic source material and delivers a message to an entire
generation.<br /><br />Edward Norton delivers my favourite performance of anyone ever. His dry
narration really brings to life the doom and gloom of everyday life.<br /><br />Brad Pitt oozes charisma as Tyler Durden and makes you question your
thoughts on society. It&#39;s great that the audience doesn&#39;t question
Tyler when he rants about them not becoming movie stars when the line&#39;s
coming from megastar Brad Pitt, he must be good.<br /><br />Fincher&#39;s direction is what MAKES the film though. It&#39;s dark edgey
atmosphere paints a surreal yet sinister world and the last few shots
are cinematic gold.<br /><br />10/10
