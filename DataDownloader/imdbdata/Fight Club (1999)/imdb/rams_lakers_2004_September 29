Who needs this movie? I sure don't. Looks like generation X or Y or
whatever the hell they are called this week love it. I'll say this, it
is the perfect movie for young troubled, bored, ignored, misunderstood,
ever-changing teens who need to escape from the shadows of their
predecessors and give themselves that angry identity of screw the world
I'm different.<br /><br />Looks like some reviewers lives are so blah that they need to push the
levels of taste until they are totally disgusting and morally wrong.
What kind of parents do they have is my question.<br /><br />First of all, punching someone in the face that many times can kill
them or at least send them to the dentist for free. What makes the kids
of today enjoy this type of behavior, fantasy or not? <br /><br />A lot of shirtless men, sure that's a great reason to applaud this
movie for some of the messed up women out there who keep picking
violent men as boyfriends and then wonder why. I saw no redeeming value
in this movie. It took me for a ride and then fooled me at the end, but
if anyone rates this in their top 5, 10, whatever then I can guess
their age category. Go to school, get a job, have a nice life and
adjust your attitudes. I sure don't have the perfect life but obviously
better than some of the messed up kids who like this because I don't
need to watch people beat the s*** out of each other for entertainment.
I'm shocked by the number of positive reviews for this crap. Get
therapy, please.<br /><br />I give this movie a 3 of 10, and that's generous. It sure is not rated
an 8 like the score in front reveals. Now I know overall statistics
mean absolutely nothing.
