...would be the only two words that can justly describe this film, that will
challenge you, entertain you, and disturb you! <br /><br />One of the best films I've seen in a long time, &quot;Fight Club&quot; concerns a
slightly depressed, insomniac, known only as &quot;Jack&quot; who looks for a way to
change his life.
He finds that in a slippery soap salesman, by the name of Tyler
Durden.
Both men form an underground boxing commune of sorts, dubbed &quot;Fight
Club&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;Fight Club&quot; is a rare film, the kind of film that only comes along once a
decade. Like &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, &quot;Fight Club&quot; was controversial when it
was first released for its frank depiction of violence. but those who can
stand the violence will be glad that they did, because this film isn't just
about a bunch of losers pounding the hell out of each other, It's so much
more!<br /><br />Yes, many compare this film to &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; and rightly so, both
films are controversial, both are based on excellent books, both sport
masterful Directors, and both are among two of the best movies I've ever
seen! <br /><br />The performances by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are awesome, the writing is
intelligent and funny, and the Direction from David Fincher (&quot;Se7en&quot;, &quot;The
Game&quot;) should have received an Oscar!
The result from all of this is a film that doesn't disappoint, from the
visually stunning opening credits, to the mind bending finale, none of it
ever loses its momentum. <br /><br />In 1999, there were only a few films that were truly great, different, and
powerful. Those were &quot;American Beauty&quot;, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, and &quot;Fight Club&quot; 
All of which should be seen more than once, especially this
one!<br /><br />***** Out of Five stars! (Outstanding!)<br /><br />
