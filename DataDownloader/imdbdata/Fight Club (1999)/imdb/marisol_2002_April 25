<br /><br />You can force it but it will not come.you can taste it but it will not
form.you can crush it but it's always here.you can crush it but it's always
near chasing you home saying everything is broken everyone is broken.you can
force it but it will stay stung. you can crush it as dry as a bone.you can
walk it home straight from school.you can kiss it.you can break all the
rules but still everything is broken,everyone is broken.why can't you forget
it?<br /><br />I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the
will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had
now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose
from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me.<br /><br />Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change. The
sun might shine or the clouds might lower: but nothing could appear to me as
it had done the day before. A fiend had snatched from me to me as it every
hope of future happiness: no creature had ever been so miserable as I was;
so frightful an event is single in the history of man.<br /><br />(Extract from a radiohead song and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.)<br /><br />
