When I was at camp, we were all twisted and started our own Fight Club
inspired fights after the counselors went out to party in the town
nearby. We would pull down our mattresses to create a cushion near the
edges of the bunk beds. <br /><br />No one was suppose to violate the three rules of Fight Club, but it did
not work out as well in the film, as after several nights of our
fights, boys from the nearby camp sneaked into our camp so they can
watch our bouts. No one seriously got hurt like the fights in the
movie, Fight Club, but in retrospect our fights were far sexier. <br /><br />Our Fight Club was brought to an end, due to the one time one of my
bunkmates got injured. After being pushed and wrestled to the ground,
one girl tried to kicked the other girl, but instead kicked the steel
frame of one of the bunk beds. Her toe began bleeding, so we took her
to the infirmary. She told the nurse she tripped on a rock, while
walking to the bathhouse, but the nurse alerted the camp director. When
the camp director went to investigate, she found a cabin in disarray
with teenagers in underwear surrounded by mattresses and boys. <br /><br />The next day, parents were called, and we all blamed our behavior on
Fight Club. For the rest of camp, the director made our counselors stay
in our cabins at night. They were upset they couldn&#x27;t go out anymore at
night to party, so as punishment, they made us watch Fight Club every
night for the rest of the summer.
