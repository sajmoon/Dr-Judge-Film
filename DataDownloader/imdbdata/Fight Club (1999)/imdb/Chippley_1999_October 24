Fight club has to be one of the best movies I have seen in recent history.
With an original story line, great performances from Brad Pitt and Ed
Norton
made this a very memorable film! In a nutshell, the film is about one man's
descent to becoming Anarchy's poster child. After having his apartment and
his life destroyed by an &quot;accident,&quot;  (Ed Norton) begins a new life of self
discovery by living in a run-down dump of a house, and beginning and
underground organisation featuring fist fights as a release for the common
man. The film builds to a much larger plot which keeps you guessing up
until
the very end of the film. Some raunchy humor and truley unique charecters
make this a great film.<br /><br />My rating: 4 1/2 stars.
An excellent film! Go see it as long as you don't mind crude humor and LOTS
of violence.
