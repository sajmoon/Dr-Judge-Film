1999_December 27 

What happens when you see a movie called &quot;Fight Club&quot;? What's the first
thing that comes to your mind? I'm pretty sure everybody expects 2 hours of
pure fight scenes and no script, like some of the Van Damme movies, or
Jackie Chan.<br /><br />Well, I have something to tell everybody: NO. Yes, you heard me right, NO.
This movie is not just about fighting, this movie is excellent, and it has
messages to send to the people who watch it, of course, you have to
understand, like and figure out the message.<br /><br />I've talked to several people after watching this film a couple of times in
the theaters, and most of them said they were affected by this movie, and I
do not blame them. I was kind of affected too, not like most of the people,
they say they feel a desire to hit somebody after watching the movie, I did
not feel like that after watching it, but I felt that something inside me
changed.<br /><br />Tyler Durden... If I ever change my name, I'll call myself Tyler Durden.
Brad Pitt makes one hell of a performance, and Ed Norton is also great, as
in all of his movies.<br /><br />I can say one thing after seeing this film... I want to be like Tyler
Durden. I liked that character SO much.. that it is even hard to
explain.<br /><br />It's both, Brad Pitt and Ed Norton best movie, no question about that, even
when Norton's &quot;Primal Fears&quot; was also excellent.<br /><br />I'll rate this movie with a 10 out of 10, I think it deserves that score,
and most of the other user's comments say so.
...And remember, the first rule of Fight Club is, &quot;You do not talk about
Fight Club&quot;.
