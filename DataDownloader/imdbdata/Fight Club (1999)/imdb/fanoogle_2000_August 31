Hands down the greatest movie ever made. I could understand people not
liking it, but anyone who calls it trash is jealous. No one has ever seen
anything like this and they are afraid of something they don't understand
so
they call it trash. Also, it's only a movie. So relax. Why take all that
time to write about something you hate.
