FIGHT CLUB<br /><br />STARRING:
BRAD PITT, EDWARD NORTON, HELENA BONHAM CARTER AND MEATLOAF
   <br /><br />   Brad Pitt and Edward Norton team up for this action flick. Edward
Norton's character has insomnia in the beginning of this movie. He enters
counseling to help him with his condition. There he meets the depressed
Helena Bonham Carter. Brad Pitt is found in an airplane with a suitcase full
of &quot;soap&quot;. This soap later represents the bombing that occured in Edward's
building. Brad and Edward start a fighting club where a group of men of all
ages join in. <br /><br />This movie is very fast-paced flick. You need to pay close attention to each
and every move they take. The end is a shocker. Don't miss out seeing this
movie. It's worth it!! <br /><br />I give this movie **** stars out of *****. <br /><br />
