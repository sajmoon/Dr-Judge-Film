This film starts out good then it just disappoints.  It just gets stupid
and
stupider.  The first half hour led me to believe it was going to be good.
Edward Norton attending support groups for problems and diseases he
pretended to have.  Trying to get Seconal for his insomnia.  This film
could
have been so much better.  By the way, I do not care for Brad Pitt.  Not
worth watching.  2/10
