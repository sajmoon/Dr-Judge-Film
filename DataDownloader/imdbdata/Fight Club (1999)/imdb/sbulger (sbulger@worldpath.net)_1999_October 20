1999_October 20 

Not only was it a great movie, but a great cinematic experience as well.
Well written, acted, filmed. A couple of spots seemed to drag just for a
bit, but they picked right up again (or maybe I just missed something,
which
would have been easy to do since this movie was an a visceral assault on
your mind.) I feel this film deserves a second viewing to catch it all. Not
at all what you expect from the trailer. Theatres need to strictly enforce
the admittance of minors to this film so ignorant teens dont start up fight
clubs all over. This is not about fighting in the usual sense. More about
fighting for your sense of self. If you don't understand parts, ask someone
who saw the movie with you. Talk about it. It will come to you. If you
still
don't get it, it's too late for you.
