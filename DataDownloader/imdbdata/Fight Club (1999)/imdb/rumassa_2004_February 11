2004_February 11 

When I saw this film for the first time I really could not quite believe
what a great film I had just seen. Basically the harmony this film
presents
sets it to be my favourite film. Concerning integrity, ideas,
directography
knowledge, filmography and photography I think this film is
unequable.
