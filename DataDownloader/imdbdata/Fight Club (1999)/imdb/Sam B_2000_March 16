This would have to be one of the best movies of all time, it's original and
brilliant unlike The Blair Witch Project.  
I read the book before seeing the movie and I thought the book was great,
the style of writing is second to none.  I was amazed at how David Fincher
made it almost exactly like the book, the movie was made superbly it is also
original, for instance when it shows Edward Norton and Bradd Pitt explaining
what he does with the movie reels and what he does as a
waiter.
Edward Norton has proved himself to be one of the best actors ever after
making Fight Club and American History X, his acting in Fight Club was just
amazing.  Bradd Pitt also proved that he is more than just a body for women
to stare at, he can act too.  I couldn't picture any other actors doing
those parts as well as them.<br /><br />Overall I give this movie 12/10 and if you don't like this movie you are too
old or can't handle a little criticism against white collar
workers!
