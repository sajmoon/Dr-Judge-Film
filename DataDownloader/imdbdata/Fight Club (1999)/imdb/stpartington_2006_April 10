This is one of the silliest movies I have ever seen.<br /><br />It is not only not credible that such clubs exist; the motivation of
the characters in this film to act the way they do is simply not
believable.<br /><br />Having said that the performances are quite good. Brad Pitt and Edward
Norton always deliver consistent well rounded performances. It is
unfortunate that their efforts are wasted here due to an unsatisfactory
script and an incredible plot line.<br /><br />The ending of the film is especially unsatisfying and .... well, weird.
I guess one should have expected that from the lengthy period of grief
that precedes it. The performances probably rate more than a 2 rating,
but I think it deserves a rap on the knuckles just in case someone
wants to make Fight Club II
