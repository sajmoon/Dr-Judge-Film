Plainly the best movie out there. I can't belive it is only at 37th. The
story, sounds, camera shots, everything is perfect. The quotes from this
movie are incredible, I find myself reciting them all the time. Brad Pitt
plays a great role ad Tyler, but Edward steals the show with his
narrating.
The perfect actor for the job.
Many people say the movie is too gory, but I disagree. It has its
gross
parts but it is not as gory as most action films and whatnot. And its dark
parts just help to add to the theme of the movie.
Its just indescribible, so if you haven't watched it rent it. And if
you have buy it.
