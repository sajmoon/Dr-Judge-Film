&gt; I had heard a lot about Fight Club, and the movie turned out to be much
&gt; better than I had expected. Partially because of superb performances
from
Ed
&gt; Norton and Brad Pitt. The narration by Ed Norton lends this movie a
unique
&gt; touch and his style of saying everything - from serious to funny - in a
&gt; monotone gets on to you after a while. There is a twist in the end, I
wont
&gt; reveal it. Overall, the gloomy look and different way to look at life is
&gt; interesting. But for me, I liked the movie more because of the great
acting,
&gt; rather than the content of the movie.
&gt;
&gt; Interesting to watch - if you havent watched it yet, go for
&gt; it!!
