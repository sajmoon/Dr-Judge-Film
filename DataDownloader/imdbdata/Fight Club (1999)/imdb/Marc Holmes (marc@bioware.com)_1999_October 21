This is an excellent, thought provoking movie. Fight Club will make you
evaluate your priorities in life. If you hate your job, see this movie. It's
a mental kick to the crotch.<br /><br />This movie is a breath of fresh air in a very stale industry. The visuals
are fresh, the script is raw and honest, and the ideas in the film might
actually change your life.<br /><br />Don't be scared by the 'violent' content. The violence in this film serves
the story well, and is used 'honestly.'  It is far less disgusting and/or
titilating than many Hollywood blockbusters.<br /><br />Overall I would say; see this film if you are looking for a new visual
experience, or a film with guts and brains.
