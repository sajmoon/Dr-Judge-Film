I finally saw this one on DVD.  The first quarter of this film is promising
with its humor, irony, and wit.  However, once the major premise is
exploited, the entire film falls apart in the worst way.  The fact is that
the premise was too thin to support a feature film; I mean, where do you
really go with fist-fighting yuppoids?  What does it ultimately accomplish,
aside from various injuries, brain damage?  Where do you go with it?  The
director apparently didn't know, either, and the film leaves all sense
behind and indulges in extravant fantasy adventure that doesn't speak to the
original premise.  Fact is, the Hollywood remedy was applied: if the film is
lost, &quot;save it&quot; with a lot of hyperbolic action and tricky twists that let
the film go out in a blaze of cheap director tricks (you'll see what I
mean).
