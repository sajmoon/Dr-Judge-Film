There isn't really a way to tell you exactly what &quot;Fight club&quot; is.  Some
might say it's a black-comedy, others might call it a social drama, others,
a social comedy.  I'm not sure which of those adjectives describe the movie
best but the adjective &quot;One of the 5 best movies of the year&quot; sure
qualifies.  Another one would be &quot;One of Norton's best performance's ever&quot;.
In fact, it's probably his best after the one he gave in &quot;American history
X&quot;.  And yet another way to qualify it would be &quot;By far David Fincher's
best
movie yet&quot;.  Yes, &quot;Fight club&quot; is an excellent movie and true
entertainment.
Plus, there are great performances by Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena
Bonham Carter and Meat Loaf and great direction by David
Fincher.<br /><br />The story is narrated by Edward Norton whose name seems to be Jack
although he is never called like that by anyone leaving us in doubt.  He
explains how he thought his life was a total bore and how he joined certain
groups like groups for people with testicular cancer just to make friends.
This is where he meets Bob (Meat Loaf) and befriends him.  However, at some
point, he sees a woman named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) in all
those groups and guesses she has none of the problems the people attending
the reunions have.  However, Jack doesn't either.  So they make a deal so
that they do not meet again:  every week, they go to she goes to certain
groups while he goes to other groups so they won't see each
other.<br /><br />Weeks go by without anything really happening and one day, on a plane,
Jack meets a man who calls himself Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt).  Tyler sells
soap for a living.  After the plane lands, the two men each go their own
way
but when Jack gets home, he sees that his apartment has been blown-up and
decides to call Tyler to ask him if he might have a free bed at his house.
They decide to go to a bar and after three pitchers of beer, they are
approaching the bar's closing time and go outside.  This is when, out of
the
blue, Tyler asks Jack to hit him.  The two men finally end up fighting for
real and seem to get some kicks out of it and after a while, they decide to
form a fight club whose two principal rules are &quot;You do not talk about
Fight
club&quot;.<br /><br />The movie starts off right in the action and never lets the viewer down.
Jim Ulhs's screenplay is excellent.  David Fincher also uses a few slow
motions to add a certain intensity to the scene.  The music by the Dust
brothers is excellent and the other songs used are excellent as well.
However, as good as everything about this movie is, nothing beats Edward
Norton's performance.  He is simply incredible.  Over here in Canada, the
movie got the harshest rating which is &quot;18 and over&quot; and did deserve
because
although there isn't only violence in this movie, it is very graphic and
depicted as it is just when it happens to a person.  Also, the violence
shown is especially during the fights and no one dies in these
fights.
It isn't for the faint-hearted and has a disappointing ending but if you
can
get to gather all the courage you have to watch this one, you'll see you'll
be glad you saw it.
