1999_December 12 

I was afraid that Fight Club would not meet my high expectations, since I
thought that it would be a superb movie; and that I would leave the movie
theatre disappointed. But as I started to watch the movie, in the first few
minutes, I knew that this was a fabulous one. Fight Club is extremely funny
and witty. Definitely my kind of movie. Worth watching over and over
again.<br /><br />One more thing is: I've already lost my faith that the Oscars are given
according to merits, but still I do hope this movie gets the best picture
award cause it deserves it. Also Brad Pitt and Edward Norton and Helena
Bonham Carter should be nominated for their splendid
performances.
