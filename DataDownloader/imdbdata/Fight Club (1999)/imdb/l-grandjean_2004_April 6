When the Fight Club turns into the extremely stimulating Chaos project,
the
movie changes our perception and leads us in another world. It makes us
discover our real human nature : we are animals and that's all we are .
Nothing more. The Fight Club is one of the best cinematographical things
that occurred in the past years . Please : watch it and don't forget that
you are the destinatary of the message, don't think it's only for other
guys. The Fight Club provides us a new vision of our world and helps us to
understand it better. Check that movie out and come back to the IMDB vote
chart and let your neurons explode. You will see that you really feel
better. And, above all, never forget that i'am Tyler Durden
!
