Okay, first off, I think this is the type of movie that people watch and
think, &quot;Whoa!  I'm really artsy fartsy for watching this movie!&quot;  And
they
are so hung up on the alleged &quot;artsy&quot; qualities of it, that they rave
about
how wonderful it is, rate it a 10 on imdb, and say it's the best movie
they've ever seen.  (read: _Memento_)<br /><br />I'm not going to say I disliked this movie, because I didn't.  I liked
the
majority of the movie.   Some of it was done in a too-trendy, obnoxious
way,
but it appealled to the target audience (early 20s guys, I suppose) so it
worked.  But the ending just left me feeling disappointed and sort of
gypped.<br /><br />The acting was good.  Edward Norton is very funny in this movie...even if
this movie isn't a comedy, his role has a lot of comedic values.  He's a
great actor and was well cast.  Meatloaf was funny too.  Brad Pitt was
decent, and Helena Bonham Carter was radient and suited the movie's
attitude.<br /><br />But to those of you who think this is the best movie out there...you must
have not seen very many movies in your day.  Rent a few classics.  And
realize that movies that try to be all &quot;indie&quot; and everything doesn't
make
them wonderful.
