I loved this film!  At first I thought that it would just be a film about
an
underground fight club, but it is so much more.  Brad Pitt and Edward
Norton
did a great job in their characters roles.  Plus the twisted ending makes
the film great!  I would recommend this film to anyone who can take a
little
violence for the greater good of the movie.
