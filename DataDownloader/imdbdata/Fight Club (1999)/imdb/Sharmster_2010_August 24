The more times I watch this film, the more I admire it.<br /><br />The film works on so many levels &#x96; a gripping plot and narrative,
fascinating characters, and provocative questions about the nature of
our modern existence. And the film is executed with aplomb &#x96; adept
direction and editing (with no wasted scenes, moments, or details),
excellent cinematography, the perfect tone, strong performances, and a
great soundtrack/score.<br /><br />It&#x27;s no accident that Fight Club has become not only a cult classic,
but an institution. The sad fact is Hollywood has stopped making these
types of films, which only makes Fight Club more endearing.
