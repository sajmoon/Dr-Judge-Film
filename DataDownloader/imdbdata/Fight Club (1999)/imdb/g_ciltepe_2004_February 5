This movie is so good that I wish to thank all the people who produced it.
And also I wish to say congratulations. David Fincher was so impressive,
exciting and taking us far away from the world that we are living on. I
think Edward Norton has also given his best performance to execute it at
the
highest level. The theme of the movie as the musical perspective, was
incredible good. As for the final, it was so mystical that I got feelings
similar for The Sixth Sense surely this was produced then. Thank you boys!
This is a real movie! I got so good feelings about it. Many
thanks.
