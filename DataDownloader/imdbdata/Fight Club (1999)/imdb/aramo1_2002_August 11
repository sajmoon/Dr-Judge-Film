Based on R2 DVD 134 min.<br /><br />I must confess this movie left me with a sense of 'why the hell was that
about?'. None the less it is engrossing and enjoyable while it runs through
its two and a quarter hours of mayhem, madness, some rather gruesome
violence and brief pornographic moments.<br /><br />It would have been nice had the movie stayed a little closer to story setup
in the first half hour, which played a little more intelligently then the
story that finally unfolded.<br /><br />6/10 worth watching.
