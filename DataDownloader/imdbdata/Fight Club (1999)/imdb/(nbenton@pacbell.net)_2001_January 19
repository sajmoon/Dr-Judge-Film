&quot;In the world i see, you are stalking elk through the damp canyon forests
around the ruins of rockefeller center. you wear leather clothes that will
last you the rest of your life.  you climb the wrist-thick vines that wrap
the sears tower, and when you look down, you see tiny figures pounding
corn
and laying strips of venison on the empty car pool lane of some abandoned
superhighway.&quot;<br /><br />So is the vision of Tyler Durden and the ultimate outcome of the actions
of
what was once a group of lost souls that were part of something called
Fight
Club. That later evolved into Project Mayhem.<br /><br />Fight Club is, in my opinion, the greatest movie ever made. Every moment
of
the film is drenched with style, substance, and vision. Every scene
thoroughly thought out to pound home the message that this writer (whose
name
escapes me) had to say. There are to many metaphors thrown into this movie
that one could not begin to explain them.<br /><br />Lets get right to the heart of this film, the center of its
message...Tyler
Durden. An anarchist, a revolutionary...or rather, just another guy in the
world, seperated only by his courage.  The moment he first speaks i was
completely captivated on his every word. Tyler is truly one of the only
people ive ever met (i know hes a movie character, but you know what i
mean..) that i would follow. He, like so many REAL people, have seen
through
the blinds of society, through advertising, and commercialism...he sees
what
the world is now, and what it could be. What it has been, and when it
comes
down to it...what it should be. &quot;Advertising has us chasing cars and
clothes. Working jobs we hate, so we can buy s**t we dont need!&quot; &quot;We have
no
great war, and no great depression. But our great war is a spiritual
war...our great depression, is our lives.&quot;<br /><br />There is so much truth behind every thing this man says that &quot;fight club&quot;
might literally change your life.<br /><br />Yes, there is fighting...yes there is violence and quite a bit of
swearing.
And yes there is sex. But none of that is what this movie is really about.
I
view the fighting as being a metaphor. For one, its the only thing we have
to make us feel...real. We can call ourselves human, separate ourselves
from
all the other life around us and bestow any crowns upon ourselves that we
so
choice but for many of us...we just want to be what we are - animals.
Hunters and gathers. Not lawyers or salesman. Not secretaries or doctors.
we
are what we've been since the dawn of life in the universe, and nothing,
no
ad compains or lawsuits against nature can change this. I also view the
fighting, as the people having the media beaten out of them. The pain
frees
them from society and all the expectations and requirements that are
thrown
at us. &quot;We are hunters in a world of shopping&quot;. One could say all this
would
be (the world myself, tyler, and many others see) is a regression of what
the human race has accomplished. It is not, it is the realization that all
we really need is freedom. And its the voice of a generation, raised on
expectations, crying out for a chance to truly be alive. Far before we
die...we want to live. not in the world all the '60's sellouts setup for
us.
but in a world that is natural...a world that is alive and free!<br /><br />As of now, must of my generation (im 19 by the way)might still be
fascincated
by the wonder that is Britney Spears and the blackstreet boys and what
have
you. But its only a matter of time before someone like Tyler Durden comes
along. One day this world will be ours (as if it isnt all ready) and we
will
do with it as we so please. There will be no shopping malls, no
superhighways, no teletubbies, no pokeman, and no Martha Stewart.
Hopefully we will all realize what we can do before its too
late.<br /><br />Im glad this movie came out...all the old people int his world (the ones
that
happen to be in authority) can ridicoul it all they want. i would imagine
they view ideas like this as a threat to them.<br /><br />All i have left to say (im sure i have more but cant think or anythingelse
now) is watch this movie with an open mind and see it, and yourselves, and
life, for what they are and what they can be....infinite and
free.<br /><br />because you are not your job. you arent the car you drive. you arent how
much money you have in the bank. you arent the contents of your wallet.
and
you are not your  kackis....you are alive. and its only after youve
lost everything that you are free to do anything...<br /><br />in tyler we trust....<br /><br />
