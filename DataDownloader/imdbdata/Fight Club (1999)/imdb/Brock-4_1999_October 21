An intense film filled with disturbing, hip, and provocative scenes of
violence, nihilism, and anarchy, FIGHT CLUB will almost certainly appeal to
men more than women. Nevertheless, it presents a compellingly primitive
imperative (and philosophy) in the character of Tyler Durden, whom we find
charming despite his extremism. It also presents a few twists and turns in
a
cleverly written script which addresses the valuelessness and sense of
dispossession felt by the unfortunate generation categorized as 'X'. Two
thumbs way up for director FINCHER, and everyone in the
film.
