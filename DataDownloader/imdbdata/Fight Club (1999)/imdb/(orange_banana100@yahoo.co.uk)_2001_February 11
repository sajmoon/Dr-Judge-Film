When I first heard of it it sounded like another movie, with car
chases, fighting, fighting and more fighting, maybe the occasional
damsel in distress thrown in here or there. But when I was finally
convinced to watch it my expectations were proven wrong. I was at
the edge of me seat not knowing what to make of it until the end.
Its a hilariously funny movie, with outcomes, and thoughts that  I
could easily relate to, which made it much more interesting. I know
that being only 14 probably makes me too  young to understand
the movie, but I can, even though I'm actually not supposed to see
it... I think  it is brilliant; it has the best director and a brilliant
cast.
