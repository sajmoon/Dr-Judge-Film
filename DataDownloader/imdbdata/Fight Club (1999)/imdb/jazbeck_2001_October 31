It's incredible that the academy didn't nominate this one for best movie! I
my own personal opinion &quot;fight club&quot; is the second best movie of 1999 (right
after &quot;the matrix&quot;), and it even has a very important message that only a
few could understand.<br /><br />This movie shows people what they should do in situations like the ones a
month ago (the WTC)... &quot;everything is going to be fine&quot; that's what Edward
Norton's character says when he watches the U.S. economy going down, and I
think that's what we should think.<br /><br />Another lesson that I learned with this film, was that we are searching for
our enemy in a far place, when maybe, just maybe it's right behind us, maybe
is the guy next door (like Tyler). Everyone can be a psycho, that's what I
learned.<br /><br />So if you want to take a few life lessons I highly recommend this
movie
