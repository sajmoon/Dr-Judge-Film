That's what I thought at when I first saw the previews of this film back in
1999.  At first, I didn't pay much attention to these previews and and
completely ignored it when came out on tape.  I didn't really get a chance
to watch it until my cousin bought the tape and I watched it then.<br /><br />It's about a guy who from what we know is simply referred to as The Narrator
(played by Edward Norton.)  He's an insomniac(for those of you who don't
what an insomniac is, it's someone who has trouble sleeping.)  So he come up
with a cure, which is to attend group meetings.  Which almost immediately
cures his insomnia.  That is however, until he meets Marla Singer (Helena
Bonham Carter) another &quot;faker&quot; whose just there for unexplained reasons.  So
his insomnia starts up again.  <br /><br />While attending one of his usual business trips, The Narrator meets up with
a rather unusual fellow named Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt) who is also a very bad
dresser.  The two quickly become friends and set up &quot;Fight Club.&quot;  It's
where men pummel each other to bloody pulps.  Soon however, it gets a little
out hand and the it quickly becomes &quot;Project Mayhem&quot; which is basically a
terrorist organization that quickly begins popping up cities across the
country.  <br /><br />I really liked Fight Club.  It's dark, violent, and very funny.  It also
contains some of the funniest moments I've ever seen in a movie that isn't
really a comedy.  <br /><br />I should also say that some people may get the wrong idea about this movie
and might set up their own fight clubs.<br /><br />Anyway, Fight Club is a great movie full of violence, darkness, and some
very funny moments.<br /><br />10/10<br /><br />
