Oh, wait! Is it over yet? An over-hyped piece of testosterone crap. Great
performances, but too bad the script drags the performances down with it.
My
favorite part about this whole overrated movie is that IMDB users have
this
ranked as a better piece of filmmaking than &quot;Raging Bull,&quot; &quot;Sunset Blvd,&quot;
&quot;Jaws,&quot; &quot;On the Waterfront,&quot; and &quot;Apocalypse Now.&quot; Wow... has anyone here
seen a movie that came out before &quot;Star Wars?&quot;
