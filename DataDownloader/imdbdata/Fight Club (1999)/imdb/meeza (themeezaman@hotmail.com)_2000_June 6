&quot;Fight Club&quot; is a type of film that will not totally knock you out with
excitement, but it does go the distance thanks to some of its complex twists
and turns. The movie is billed as Brad Pitt as its star. However, it is
really the Edward Norton character which this film revolves around. To bill
Pitt as the main actor, was a bit displeasing and just plain pitiful. This
experimental story is about an underground fight club started by the Norton
and Pitt characters. What I thought was worth fighting for was to have more
of Norton and co-star Helena Bonham Carter dual scenes. Their chemistry was
a unanimous winning duo! We just did not get enough of it. Also, I felt like
throwing the towel a few times when I saw a bit too many long scenes that
were not instrumental to the film's following striking developments.
Finally, if you do go see &quot;Fight Club&quot; make sure you follow these two
rules-
1) You do not tell anyone the ending of &quot;Fight Club&quot; 2) You do not tell
anyone the ending of &quot;Fight Club.&quot;
