Fight Club, in my opinion, was an excellent film, and it should be as it
comes from David Fincher.  Mr. Fincher has a phenomenal way of confronting
materialistic issues with this film.  He is able to entertain you yet
teach
you a valuable lesson at the same time.  I think there is a little bit of
Tyler in all of us.  We all have these urges to exclude ourselves from
society and do what we feel needs to be done to help society along.  Tyler
was a way in which we were able to use our imaginations.  The twisted way
in
which all of the characters are involved is typical of David Fincher.
Just
as in Se7en, Mr. Fincher causes us to really think through all of the
events
that are happening and see the whole sum of the plot at the end.  However,
Fight Club is a movie that needs to be seen more than one time to
completely
grasp the meaning of the movie and its purpose.  I encourage anyone to
watch
it again...you will definitely see more than you saw before.  Great Job
Mr.
Fincher!
