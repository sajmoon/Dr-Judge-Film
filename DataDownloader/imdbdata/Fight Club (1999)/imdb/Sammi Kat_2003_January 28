2003_January 28 

Probably one of the most contrived things I've ever seen. Far too long, far
too violent, and with a plot twist none of the poltroons who love this crud
will see coming. Even the usually squeaky-clean Helena Bonham Carter looks
horrid, hanging out with these dirty boys. Practically everyone I know loves
this film, and all I can do is wonder why. I wanted to love this movie, but
for the last 45 minutes or so, all I kept saying to myself was &quot;Somebody
please roll the credits!&quot; By the time the film was over I didn't care how it
ended, as long as it was over. I find it difficult to believe that this
movie only got an R rating.
