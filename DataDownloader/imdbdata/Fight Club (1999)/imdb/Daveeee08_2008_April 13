Insurance drone Jack (Norton) can&#39;t sleep, and haunts self-help groups
for fatal illnesses until he encounters Tyler Durden (Pitt), a
charismatic anarchist who invites him to move into his decrepit house
after his condo is blown up. Jack and Tyler have recreational
fist-fights, which expand into an underground masculinist movement.
However, cracks appear in the relationship as Tyler cops off with a
Goth bizarro (Bonham Carter) and his pranks go from subversive to
near-homicidal.<br /><br />Fight Club is one movie that exactly caught the pre-millennial tension.
Great performances, stunning visuals and a plot like nothing you&#39;ve
ever seen - one of the best films of the nineties.
