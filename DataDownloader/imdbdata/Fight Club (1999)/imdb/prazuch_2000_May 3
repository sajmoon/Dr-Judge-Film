Now, sure, may think that this is just another violent senseless movie to
get young boys/girls to rush out and waste time.  Well, if you think this,
you're wrong.  This film dives  deep into your mind, grabs at every point
and flips it around and around. This film isn't like any other you've seen
guaranteed.  The acting is great, the atmosphere is unexpected, people beat
themselves up and there's always the memorable liposuction clinic scene.
Not to mention, a &quot;blow your mind&quot; twist you'll never expect coming.  You
will never look at insomnia the same way again after this movie.  Now, this
isn't a movie for EVERYONE, but, if you're someone who is looking for a new
experience and a movie that plays with your mind, see this.  You will leave
this movie saying to yourself &quot;..what....geeze....&quot;.
