Fight Club has great acting, cinematography, and a great story. If you
look into the story, beyond the fight club itself or operation mayhem,
you can see that Marla Singer is actually the one who brings this story
to its epitemic halt. Notice that the Narrator (Norton) and Tyler
Durden (Brad Pitt) are never in the same room at the same time. This
obviously means only one thing; the Narrator's fed up with his life and
introduces himself to a thought up character to make his life more
interesting. Tyler says in the movie that he is the Narrator and that
Tyler has taken over control of what his counterpart can do to limit
his destruction. To destroy all the beauty in life the Narrator created
a monster that cannot be controlled. The world is destroyed and
everyone can start over.
