David Fincher has done it once again, by delivering a dark, gritty, and
violent movie. All this comes together to form a movie which is not too
bad if you don't mind violence.<br /><br />The violence does tend to get a little overboard, but you begin to get
used to it as the movie progresses. At times it is silly, (i.e. The
Narrator beating himself up infront of his boss) But it never reaches
an unbelievable level. <br /><br />The acting is good. Brad Pitt pulls in a very good role as Tyler
Durden, and Edward Norton plays the role of The Narrator very good. All
of the other actors do very well in their roles through out the movie.<br /><br />The movie holds a couple of twists that must be seen more then once to
fully understand them. I'm not going to give them away to people who
have not seen the movie, as the final twist was reveled to be before I
saw the movie. And it was no big surprise when it came around.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes David Fincher's
movies, and a good solid story. <br /><br />Just remember that once you see the movie, there are little things that
were in there that you did notice. So you must see it again to catch
them.
