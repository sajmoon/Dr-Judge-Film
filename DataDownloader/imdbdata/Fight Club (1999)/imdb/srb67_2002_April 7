The amount of feeling this movie has created shows what a great piece of
art
it is.  Tyler (Brad Pitt) is wonderfully charismatic and evil.  His
philosophy strikes a chord with a lot of people, including the movie-goer,
which makes the ending all the more powerful.<br /><br />Excellent movie and you may never look at soap in the same way
again.
