For everybody about to watch the movie for the first time:<br /><br />DO NOT WATCH IT WITH SUBTITILES!<br /><br />This ruins the ending and doesn&#x27;t distract the audience member from an
important point in the movie. I will not say in this message because I
don&#x27;t like spoilers.<br /><br />For people showing other people Fight Club for the first time: same.
Don&#x27;t turn on the subtitles because of the voice-overs. TRUST ME! It
ruins the ending if you turn on the subtitles.<br /><br />This movie is excellent otherwise. Very psychological and deep. I had
to watch it the second time to get all the subtle stuff, but besides
that, it was a fantastic movie.
