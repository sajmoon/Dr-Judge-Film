My advice is...don't read any more about this movie and just watch
it.
My roommate rented it and my expectations were low...only because I
didn't
know what to expect.  Within 10 minutes I was hooked, and this is
possibly
the best movie I have seen in at least 5 years.
This movie is about much more than fighting, but the fight sequences
in
it are visually entertaining, and the violence isn't over the top.  Brad
Pitt's character, Edward Norton's narration, and Meatloaf's supporting
role
are all top-notch...and the direction style is engrossing without being
obnoxious (obnoxious like Oliver Stone, Or Quentin Tarintino, for
instance).
The entertaining dialog and bombshell of a plot twist will more than
likely have you wathing this moive more than once.
