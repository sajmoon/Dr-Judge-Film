Which is ok in my book. This movie seems to be taking the
theme of reaching your inner child, to a new place. What
if your inner child were a head butting little sociopath.
And what if that triggered the same evolution in others.
Sometimes hard to follow, it asks a lot of suspension of
disbelief. If you can roll with the punches it's worth
it.
