I won't go into the story too much but it is about an insomniac (Edward
Norton) who is bored of his life. He then meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt)
and
he introduces the insomniac to a new way of life. But this only the
beginning to what I think is the best film ever made!. I have now seen it
over 10 times and it just gets better and better. This is a film that is
better the second time you see than the first because you feel different
towards the characters. The film is very original and is very funny. It is
also pure genius. I won't say much more but just look out for things on
repeated viewings. I didn't think there was that much violence and it is
really only one fight that is really bad.The acting is superb, the two male
leads Brad Pitt (Seven) and Edward Norton (American History X)really are
spectacular! The direction from David Fincher (The Game) is great and the
twist at the end I didn't see coming at all. Just watch this film. Some of
my friends didn't like the first time but loved it the second time. If you
have a DVD player you should check out the excellent 2 disc set. This film
will remain in your head for along time because it is so clever and funny.
Watch it now and you won't regret it! 10/10
