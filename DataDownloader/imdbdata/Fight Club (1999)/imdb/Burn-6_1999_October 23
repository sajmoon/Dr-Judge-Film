1999_October 23 

I have always enjoyed David Fincher's films.  I still think that Alien 3 is
the best of the series.  Although Se7en brought Fincher into notariety,
Fight Club could make him as well known as James Cameron, or Tim Burton.
Fight Club may be the best film of the year.  The script is great and the
directing makes it even better.  The acting is superb.  Ed Norton is great
as always (has he ever been bad in a film?).  And Brad Pitt proves once
again that he is more than a pretty boy.  Even Meatloaf is great.  This is
the type of film that you will want to see at least two or three times.
Fight Club.  Go see it.
