2000_June 4 

I love action movies and though the filming and the fight 
sequences were exceptionally done, I was disappointed in
this movie. The story and characters were unbelievable 
and it was hard to relate for any character because it
was
hard to find the &quot;Good Guy&quot;. The entire movie glorified
senseless violence, the characters were one dimensional 
with Brad Pitt giving perhaps his most uninspired 
performance of his career.  It  shouldn't surprise  anyone 
that this movie did so poorly at the box office after the first
week.
