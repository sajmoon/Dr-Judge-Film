1999_November 1 

I came expecting an anarchist fighting movie.  What I got was so much more.
The pacing is a bit off though.  Parts of the movie DRAG. Once you hit the
&quot;gotcha&quot; portion of the movie, it causes you to look at everything you've
seen in an entirely different light.<br /><br />This is a movie you are going to want to see more than
once.
