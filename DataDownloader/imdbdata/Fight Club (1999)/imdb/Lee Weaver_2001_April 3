Having heard about the violence and &quot;dark qualities&quot; of this film I was
hesitant to watch it but finally decided I could always stop watching if I
didn't like it. I was pleasantly surprised at the humor, good writing and
direction. And the themes presented give a lot of food for thought. The
impact of the movie hinges on a &quot;surprise ending&quot; that reminds one of The
Sixth Sense. Unfortunately, the movie was not crafted well enough for this
ending to &quot;hang together&quot;. There are a couple of scenes with Brad Pitt and
the &quot;Narrator&quot; that totally ruin the credibility of this surprise ending.
But, aside from that, the movie is well worth the time invested to watch
it.
