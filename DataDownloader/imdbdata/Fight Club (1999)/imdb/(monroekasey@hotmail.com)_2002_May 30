I thought that this was a brilliant movie.  I enjoyed ever minute of it.
Unfortunately, I couldn't give it a ten.  Too many things were left
unexplain(ed/able).  There were too many little gaps, flaws in the whole
story, when you sit down and really think about it.  I would recommend
this
movie to ANYONE however.  If you have trouble with it and get disturbed,
just sit back and take in the humour and entertainment of it
all.
