An office employee and a soap salesman build a global organization to
help vent male aggression.<br /><br />Have you ever seen a movie you cannot put in words? Even if it does
have a basic, simplistic plot, you realize there was something much
more hidden beneath it. You cannot put it in words, letters, or even
type it into the computer. Your mind cannot register it&#x27;s actual impact
on yourself, but you do realize you have been hit... by something. This
movie somehow accomplishes this task, making you feel as if it were
just a blurry vision, and the message only hits you. Alright, as
confusing as this post is, bare with me. Imagine yourself as the
narrator in this movie. Now imagine yourself being in his position
BEFORE everything else. Your shifting into him, realizing that your
action are parallel to his. Before you know it, you are him. I
recommend this film. It&#x27;s brilliant story, brilliant acting, brilliant
message, and brilliant filming. Everything is pounded together so
brilliantly, your going to be wondering what hit you so hard. Well...
what are you waiting for? Your just going to sit here reading reviews?
Go out and see what this is for yourself, and you&#x27;ll understand much
more than before. 10/10.
