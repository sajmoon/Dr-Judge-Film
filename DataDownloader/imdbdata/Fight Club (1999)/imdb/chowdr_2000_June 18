This movie is simply just wonderful.  My favorite movie!  As I watched this
movie, I was in to it.  Edward Norton's character reminds me of me, (only
the weird things that he does).  David Fincher made a good progress filming
this film.  There was humour, action and suspense with all....... 
Well......  Go see this movie and you'll see what I mean.  I give this movie
10/10!  <br /><br />P.S. Rule number one about Fight Club is........  We do not talk about Fight
Club.........  So less info equals better.  Just kiddding.
