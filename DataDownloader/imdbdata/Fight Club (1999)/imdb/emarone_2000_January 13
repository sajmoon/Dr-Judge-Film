I went into Fight Club already more or less aware of the plot and outcome,
but that didn't stop me from getting sucked right into it, and by the time
the climax rolled around, I'd forgotten everything I thought I knew
beforehand.<br /><br />If you only saw some pretty graphic barefisted fighting, and didn't leave
the theater with a new way to look at life, you need to sit down and watch
it again.  What a marvelous study of the human psyche and statement about
modern living!
