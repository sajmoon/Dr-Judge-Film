An insomniac discovers a whole new concept of life in this superb film.
I have to admit, this film sent an important message to me: we are all
the same person. This movie has people beating the s**t out of each
other, but also fighting against society and corporations. The members
of Fight Club learn that they'll never be rich and famous, no matter
how hard they try. That means a lot to me. I mean, I myself have hopes
of becoming a news reporter someday, but after watching this movie, I'm
thinking: Will I be famous? Would anyone care if I died? This movie
should have won Best Picture.<br /><br />&quot;It's only after you've lost everything that you're free to do
anything.&quot; -Tyler Durden<br /><br />Also, this film has some of the most amazing special effects I've ever
seen.<br /><br />I mean, it's been five years since this movie came out, and the use of
CGI is still considered flawless. Also, the music was so good that I
bought the soundtrack and work out to it almost every day. And I
wouldn't be surprised if the actors were really hitting each other. I
mean, it all sounds so real. This movie gets a perfect 10 from me.
