Just adding to the many comments here.......<br /><br />I found the movie to be a very funny film, something no one here seems to
have mentioned.<br /><br />Yes, it's dark, disturbing, brooding. It gives voice to many dark thoughts
you may have had or suspected.<br /><br />The movie is not about corporate greed or the oppression of the masses.
It's
about one man's transition, of growing up, of reassessing his priorities.
Think of the scene at the end. The Narrator reaching out to
Marla.<br /><br />The main character starts following the rules he was bought up with and
rejects those ideals throughout the movie, until the final scene where he
moves beyond the need for an emotional crutch.<br /><br />Fight Club on it's surface is a dark brooding cynical movie but those
paying
attention will notice that it's always with a wink and a smile, this is
satire. The only difference between this movie and American Beauty is it's
visual dialect, both have a similar message of breaking out of your
preconceived ideas of what your life should be about.<br /><br />For myself personally, the movie is about the Narrators growth. The
space-monkeys dont get it, they can't see the bigger picture but Tyler
leads
them by the hand towards their own enlightenment.<br /><br />
