Fight Club was one of the best movies of 1999. It provides an amazing
character study of three people who collapse out of the accepted social
norm
in an accelerating plunge that both entertains and amazes by virtue of its
self-reinforcing nature. It is one of the great &quot;Head-trip&quot; movies, and it
is one of those grand universal coincidences that it released so close to
Sixth Sense. It is very well-acted, and the quality of acting, dialog, and
story weld themselves together into a supreme film.
