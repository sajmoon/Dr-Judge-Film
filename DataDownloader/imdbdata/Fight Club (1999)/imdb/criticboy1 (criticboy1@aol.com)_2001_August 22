**** = A masterpiece to be recorded in the books and never
forgotten<br /><br />***1/2 = A classic in time; simply a must see<br /><br />*** = A solid, worth-while, very entertaining piece<br /><br />**1/2 = A good movie, but there are some uneven elements or noticeable
flaws<br /><br />** = May still be considered good in areas, but this work has either serious
issues or is restrained by inevitable elements deemed inescapable (e.g.,
genre)<br /><br />*1/2 = Mostly a heap of nothing sparked by mildly worthwhile
moments<br /><br />BOMB = Not of a viewable quality<br /><br />- Fight Club = ***<br /><br />- Rated &quot;R&quot; (for disturbingly presented graphic violence, sexuality, and
strong language)<br /><br />This movie started off very well.  I noticed from the beginning of the
titles, with the rock 'n' roll in the background, that it would be good
without a doubt.  The first twenty minutes were very interesting, and the
next hour after that was so intriguing, I thought I was in
love.<br /><br />Soon after, however, things got a little bizarre, and that comfy, welcoming
atmosphere was beginning to vanish.  The plot was becoming stranger and
stickier by the moment.  I'm not sure if the shocking ending, which seem to
be so popular these days, struck me as cool or disappointing.  It left me
with an awe which would keep me thinking about it for days.<br /><br />The acting is fun, with plenty of fighting for the guys and enough of Pitt
for the girls.  It shouldn't be considered mediocre or below for any young
people out there at all.  It certainly wasn't for me.  It's just that the
immediate ending was very abrupt after a long climax and it left me with
thought-provoking sensations.  Definately a must see, even if not entirely
enjoyable.
