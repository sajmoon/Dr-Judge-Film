there is a lot to learn from this movie, at face value it seems like a silly
movie about guys who fight, HELL NO. It is very philosophical! I love
everything about this movie! Brad Pitt and Ed Norton are two of the best
actors today, and Fincher has proven his directing magic once again. If you
were a little confused after you watched it, watch it again, its more
entertaining every time you see it! Also, notice how Brad Pitt's character
Tyler fights like Bruce Lee at the end fight with Ed Norton's character.
10!
