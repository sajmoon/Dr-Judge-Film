There is a huge misconception regarding this movie: a superficial plot
summary will dismiss it as a hyper-violent thriller with fascist
undertones (in fact, Roger Ebert called it &quot;the most frankly and
cheerfully fascist big-star movie since Death Wish&quot;). Some even refer
to it as a &#39;90s version of Kubrick&#39;s masterpiece A Clockwork Orange,
with added blood. Such descriptions are very reductive and misleading.<br /><br />It may be very violent at times (the most gruesome bits make Scorsese&#39;s
movies look rather tame), that&#39;s undeniable, but Fight Club is much
more than that. Its complex, non-linear and fascinating script (based
on the eponymous cult novel) deals with revolution, madness, and yes,
fascism on a certain level, and the film&#39;s greatness lies in how David
Fincher, who had already shown his edgy talent on Se7en and is at the
top of his game here, combines those themes to comment on our society.
That&#39;s right, beneath the gore and anarchic atmosphere lies a carefully
constructed, though not very subtle, satire on consumerism (as Brad
Pitt&#39;s character puts it: &quot;Advertising has us chasing sports cars and
clothes, working jobs we hate, so we can buy sh*t we don&#39;t need&quot;).<br /><br />The film stars Edward Norton as a nameless, bored, insomniac office
geek who&#39;s trying to find a meaning for his life. In order to do this
he starts attending various support groups, even though he has none of
the diseases (testicular cancer among them) dealt with in those
groups.This is when he meets Marla Singer (an almost unrecognizable
Helena Bonham Carter), a woman who fakes as much as he does, and
accuses her of messing up his life. The real mess, however, starts when
the Narrator runs into Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt): this guy claims to be
a simple soap producer and salesman, but in reality he&#39;s a rebel, a
psychopath who thinks people truly know themselves only after they have
been in a fight. Together, the two create Fight Club, an illegal
association where frustrated men in their thirties can unleash all
their suppressed rage, as long as they follow some simple rules (as a
matter of fact, writing this review constitutes a violation of the
first two). But as everyone knows, violence creates more violence, and
soon enough what started as an unusual way to deal with boredom becomes
an increasingly dangerous game of manipulation and destruction.<br /><br />Said manipulation suits Fincher well, the dark, bizarrely funny
universe he has created serving as a tool to reflect not only on the
changing society, but also on film itself as an art-form. While the
characters break the rules on screen, the director breaks them on his
own work, frequently exposing the fictional nature of what is being
shown (the characters address the audience directly, a pornographic
frame Tyler inserts in a family movie pops up in the actual film). In
the middle of this controlled chaos, Fincher can rely on a marvelous
cast: Norton is mesmerizing, seamlessly moving from total apathy to
fearful awareness; Bonham Carter still has to find a role as demanding,
compelling and rewarding as Marla; as for Brad Pitt, he shamelessly
steals the show from start to finish, perfecting the edge he had
started to develop in Se7en and giving us his best performance ever.
Incendiary and effortlessly cool, his only real turn as a villain is a
mix of style, darkness and charisma that has been missing in every
character he has played since..<br /><br />An absolute masterpiece, albeit one that demands at least a second
viewing before it can be completely understood and embraced, Fight Club
is one of the greatest movies of the &#39;90s, perhaps even THE best of the
entire decade.<br /><br />Totally unmissable
