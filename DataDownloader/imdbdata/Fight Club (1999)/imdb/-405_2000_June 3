2000_June 3 

While the main story of the film is strong, a man fighting against
civilization's repression of aggressive instincts by starting a club, the
film ends in a ridiculous and altogether unsatisfying way, a way so absurd
it makes a thoughtful person furious at having sat for so long to see such
a
poor ending.  It was as if the director and producer and actors said,
&quot;Well
we got it this far, but we can't think of a good ending, so let's just
make
it that Tyler is actually....&quot;<br /><br />How someone could vote this in the top 250 films of all times taxes this
writer's imagination.
