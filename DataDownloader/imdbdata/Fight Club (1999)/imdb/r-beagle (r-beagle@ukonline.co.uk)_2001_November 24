Wow, what a film. I am not going to try to explain to you how this film can
make you feel, or what implications or sub-meanings the film represents (of
which there are far too many to mention in this short review), hell, I'm
not
even going to tell you about the plot, all I'm going to tell you is that I
have seen this film nearlly 10 times now, and each time I watch it I find
another little bit to apreciate, the deph of this film is unrivelled, and
the acting from the two front men (Pitt and Norton) is as good as you will
ever find. I havent scratched the surface of the brilliance of Fight Club,
everybody should watch it atleast three times, to truly savor the genious.
Go watch it, go watch it now.
