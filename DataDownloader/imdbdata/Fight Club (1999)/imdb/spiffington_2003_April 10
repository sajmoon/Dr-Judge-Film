2003_April 10 

This film is the most important, relevant and superbly made film since
'apocalypse now'. The subject matter and ideas are soo beautifully and
painfully accurate to a generation who thinks that nobody else
understands.<br /><br />It's one of those movies that articulates the things that everyone feels
but
have never talked about. It opens doors to new possibilites in life, by
identifying and bringing about awareness to the roots of our desires and
hence our misery.<br /><br />Never has there been such an amalgam of technical, aesthetic brilliance,
direction, performance and subject matter. A film where finally every
aspect
of the film is the strong point, and is not only a brilliant film but an
incredibly positive, social and ideological force that is bringing about
change.
