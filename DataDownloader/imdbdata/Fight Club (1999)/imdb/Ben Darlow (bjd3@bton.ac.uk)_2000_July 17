Having read the various comments of other people who have seen this movie,
I
feel that I should throw in my opinion.<br /><br />This film is the voice of disillusionment, of realising that the world we
live in places unrealistic hopes and expectations on our lives and goals.
The only way we can truly escape this fact is to abandon that which we
hold
so dear. I for one totally empathise with the ideas behind it, and those
who
don't agree will be the sort of people who I would probably like to meet
staring across the cold hard concrete floor of a Fight Club anyway. People
have called this film insulting and disgraceful. These are the views of
someone accepting something at face value and then being upset that they
don't see see the true underlying meaning. How fitting, considering these
people are probably not too different from the pre-Tyler Jack
themselves.<br /><br />As for the film - it's everything you'd come to expect from David Fincher.
Stylish, dark, moody and intelligent. The Dust Brothers' soundtrack is
perfect, and the performances by Ed Norton and Brad Pitt are beyond
criticism. Visually the film excels; from the &quot;virtual&quot; IKEA catalogue in
Jack's room, to the various computer-generated fly-by shots. Like Seven, I
imagine this film will grow on me even more with repeat viewings - there
is
too much detail and intricacy in the dialogue for it to be totally
absorbed
in one go.<br /><br />It's hard to say if this film is really recommendable to most people - so
much is down to personal opinion and taste, but if you feel that you and
the
Capitalist Consumer World are not meant to be together, then maybe you
should try letting go of it all and give this film your undivided
attention.
