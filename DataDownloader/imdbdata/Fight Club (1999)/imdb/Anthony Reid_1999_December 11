1999_December 11 

Well I see nearly 200 films a year, everything from naive and patronising
childrens films to over the top effects heavy &quot;Hollywood&quot;
releases.<br /><br />&quot;Fight Club&quot; is driven by three people. Mr Norton always consistent and
excellent, if the film was that violent he would be looking at another
nomination.<br /><br />Mr Pitt, confuses me mostly, &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot; was AWFUL, but yet again he
does what he does best here in his &quot;Twelve Monkeys&quot; type of role, stick to
these kind of films rather than female oriented long and overblown romantic
dramas.<br /><br />Last but not least, Mr Fincher, &quot;The Game&quot; excellent, &quot;Se7en&quot; excellent and
was &quot;Alien 3&quot; really that bad? The true direction and fizzy style makes the
two hour plus running time just fly right by.<br /><br />Best Film of 1999. Well done Mr Norton, Mr Pitt and Mr
Fincher.
Bloody good book too!!
