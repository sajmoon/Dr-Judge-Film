2000_June 30 

I didn't know how to take this movie.  I started falling asleep halfway
through, then had to stop and watch the rest the next evening (on DVD).  I
have to say, I thought about it all the next day, and couldn't wait to see
how it ended!  The end was marvelous, and this movie was not what I
expected!  I really didn't care if I ever saw it, but my wife went and
rented it-- the next thing you know, I'm hooked!  Meat Loaf gets better
and
better- give him more stuff!  Brad was, as usual, a throwaway, but Norton
was superb!  And I kinda liked scary-girl (she could have been played by
anyone, like Brad).  But the one thing that really made me smile, was the
deliberate mis-casting of Pitt- it lent the character more substance... I
don't want to give anything away, but by casting a Hollywood &quot;heavy&quot;, it
added to the effect!  (If you saw it, you know what I mean).<br /><br />See this movie. period.
