But that&#39;s why i find it pretty charming actually. I always get an
impression of a movie the first seconds. And the intro reminded me of a
spider-man movie. But everybody says it good so i gave it a should
after all. The first part of the movie i was pretty sure i was about to
gave it a 10. The friendship between this guys was pretty amazing. To
just fight like that and then later on just become friends. And the
introduction of Tyler was pretty awesomely made as well. But then comes
the stranger part of the movie. Of course i&#39;m not going to spoil
anything, and for those who have seen the movie you know what i&#39;m
talking about. But it&#39;s pretty hard, i mean i always feel a pressure of
rating movies like this. Should i rate it high according to my opinion
or because everyone else likes it and it&#39;s on most movie top list i
check upon. These feelings mixtures a bit. If i&#39;ve seen the movie
before i check&#39;d it out on IMDb i would never have guessed that it
would be on the top 250. But it is and i can&#39;t complain i guess. But i
decided now to give this movie an 8. For still it was a good movie but
it got weirder later on and you almost get tired of it, i mean it&#39;s
like your brain cant handle all the action 8/10 &quot;A bit different fight
film, quite charming&quot;
