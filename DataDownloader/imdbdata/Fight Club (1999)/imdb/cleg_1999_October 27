Fight club in my opinion is a must see movie. The acting is great
especially by Meat Loaf (yes Meat Loaf - he did  a good job) and Edward
Norton.  The visuals cinematography and special effects were fantastic.
David Fincher is now short-listed as one of my favorite directors due to
this movie and Seven. The ideas that are presented in this film are by no
means new but pop culture is evil isn't it. The writing is uncompromising
with some very good points about society and how we have come to view
ourselves in this modern day.  10 out of 10. Four stars. Go see it right
now.
