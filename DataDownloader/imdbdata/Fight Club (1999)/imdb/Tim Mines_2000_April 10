2000_April 10 

I must admit to coming out of the cinema stunned after seeing what was
surely the greatest film of the 90's.
Not only was it the most visually breathtaking piece of celluloid that has
ever been realised, but it contains at its je blck heart a truth that no
self respecting man can shirk from.
Who can honestly admit to wanting to beat the hell out of simply for no
more
than a minor incident?
Brad Pitt gives a career defining performance, portraying a charater that
we
all want to exist within us, but is so far from societys projection of
perfection we are scared to admit it<br /><br />People say tht american beauty is a stunning piece of cinema with a
universally true moral- everthing we do can be seen as beautiful. that is
a
litlle too disney for my liking.<br /><br />Fight Club somes it up the best, we work we dont like to buy **** we dont
need.<br /><br />tyler is part of every man, just not as much as we would like
