I must have watched this movie 8 times. Why may you ask well it just a
great
movie!This movie makes us realize what our hearts can accept and do if we
let our desires win.  Edward Norton rules in this movie as well as Brad
Pitt. For those who are worried about the adult rating don't be it was
rated
so high that children do not attempt to do the same, and sadly in this era
it happens.<br /><br />I will not spoil the end for you I will only say that the end is unexpected
as it is filling. the director leaves many small details that makes this
move interesting every time you watch it again.<br /><br />I will say only once more if you did not watch this movie it is something
that is missing in your culture.For as explained before this movie can be
entertaining as it can serve as a lesson. Which lesson? Well watch it and
you
will find out.
