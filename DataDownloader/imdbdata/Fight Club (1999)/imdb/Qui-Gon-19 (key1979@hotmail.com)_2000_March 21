Wow! Thank you to David Fincher who made 3 wonderful films in a row. Seven,
which is one of the best thriller of the 90's, The Game, a cool and dark
thriller which has enough twists and turns to confuse our minds, and Fight
Club, which is just amazing. <br /><br />The surprise 'twist' at the end was great, but the movie itself is the thing
that made it even look better. Neat editing, awesome camera shots, excellent
script, solid acting, superb directing..... You name it all. It really
didn't get any recognition from the Academy's nor the critics, which really
dissapoints me. <br /><br />Edward Norton stars as the 'narrator' who thinks he's losing his mind. But
after meeting Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt), getting in a few fights changed his
life. The 30~45 minutes of fist fighting would be one of the most raw 30~45
minutes in film history. Those fight clubs grow larger and it becomes out of
control. Can society change a man into an anti-social behaving guy?
Absolutely. Maybe you hated this film because of its attitude or its graphic
violence. But I think you misunderstood this stylish film.<br /><br />Was this violence and bad-assed attitude totally necessary? Yes. Without the
violence, it would be like Eyes Wide Shut without graphic sexuality. This
film isn't only about violence. It's about how the meaningles life in
society can change people. It just used violence to show it. Okay some of it
is about violence, but it was just something the director used to desribe
the society.<br /><br />Oh and one other thing. I have seen it at the message boards that almost no
one has mentioned this film funny. The dark humor was funny as
hell.
