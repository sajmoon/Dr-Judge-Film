1999_November 8 

I came, I saw, but I was definitely not conquered by the critical raves
this
film has been receiving.  While there is much to admire in terms of acting
(consistently high all-round) and art direction, two aspects of the film
left me feeling down-for-the-count.<br /><br />First is the omnipresent voice-over narration.  Admittedly, I am not a fan
of this type of narrative short-cut, but in this instance, it was used
liberally through-out and unnecessarily 90% of the time.<br /><br />Second was the jaw-dropping plot twist, which I will not give away.  A fine
issue film was turned into a ridiculous metaphysical thriller and at this
point, I lost interest.
