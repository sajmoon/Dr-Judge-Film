fight club this movie is one of my favourite movies this movie is
amazing in its own way this movie doesn&#39;t compare to any of the other
movies iv seen the story line is amazing the acting is amazing this
movie shows how a normal person with a normal life can change into a
whole new person fight club redefines dramas i would highly recommend
this amazing movie to anyone even after 7 years we still talk about how
about this movie. even tho this movie was weird and twisted it was
still good to some people the movie might not make any sense to them
but they still find it surprisingly good if you read this comment go
rent the movie now i assure you that you will love it.
