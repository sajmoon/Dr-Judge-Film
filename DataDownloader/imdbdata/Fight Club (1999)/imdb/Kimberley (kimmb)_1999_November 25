Up-Front Admission: My initial desire to see this movie was based solely
upon Edward Norton's merit. However, after seeing it, I left with a head
rush much akin to the kind of feeling you get after riding a roller coaster
after two or three turns on the Tilt a Whirl--very disorienting and highly
addictive. This film comes out of nowhere and smacks you on the skull so
that you see stars. It's completely disturbing, but you can't look away.
Needless to say, it kind of messed with my brain a bit. The acting is first
rate, the shots are bizarrely beautiful and the plot line left me reeling
and with a strange sense that I had been sleepwalking. Huzzahs and kudos all
'round, as this is a film that yeah, *could* have been about guys pummeling
each other senseless and nothing else, but instead rose to a level of
macabre and psychologically
twisting intensity that I've rarely seen in a film. And this is speaking as
the ONLY chick in the theater at the showing that I went to. Not just a guy
flick, smart girls with a decent stomach can take the plunge as well.
