This is your movie. It's playing one minute at a time. <br /><br />Ladies and Gentlemen, this film will forever be in my top 5 favorite
films of all time. I've never been more impressed with editing and
storytelling done so stylish yet clearly readable at the same time.
Every shot has a mood. Every cut is perfect. Every poetically narrated
line is memorable. Every scene is profound. The strange music gets you
into the original mood that the film emulates. Every character is
defined. You can relate to every character in some way, whether it be a
bit of yourself or a bit of someone you closely know. This film, if
you're open enough to pay attention to its meaning, will set you free
of the burden of becoming a pack rat trapped in the rat race. Of
course, in the end, we're given a balance of philosophy. &quot;The Man&quot;, and
the human spirit can manage to find harmony, once given the proper
grown-up philosophy, I suppose.<br /><br />The only god I worship is Tyler Durden. Well...maybe not worship. More
like agree with and try to live by the same thoughts. Don't get me
wrong. If I were that close to his lifestyle, living in a dilapidated
house in the middle of a seedy part of town, I probably wouldn't be
able to type this review. I also wouldn't be sharing fluids with the
likes of Marla Singer. Ewwww...<br /><br />Joon B. Kim is one of the luckiest guys in the world in my book. Not
only did he get his own scene with Brad Pitt holding a gun to his head
in back of a convenience store, but he participated in what I think is
one of the most inspirational scenes in cinema history. Just ignore the
soda machine advertising itself in the background. Why is it that those
set dressers think that convenience stores would put their soda machine
in the back? Not a a very convenient convenience store.<br /><br />I can never get sick of this film, unless I watch it over and over for
every waking moment for every day of the rest of my life. Then I might
get a little bored.<br /><br />Was I typing? Had I typed?<br /><br />Go FINCHER and writers! 10/10
