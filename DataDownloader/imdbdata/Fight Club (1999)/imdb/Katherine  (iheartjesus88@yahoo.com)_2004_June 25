This movie is among the best that I have ever seen. It is witty,
humorous, and thought provoking. The reason that I, personally, love
this movie, is that there is a bit of Tyler Durden in every person.
This &quot;free man&quot; is suppressed within the confines of taboo and society,
and there it suffocates and dies. But that is beyond the point. What I
am feebly attempting to say about this movie, is that it is a satire on
all of the meaningless blue collar lives of the middle class of
America. <br /><br />I have heard critics that this movie is &quot;dark and cynical&quot; because they
are perhaps missing the crucial undercurrents of the purpose and depth
of this masterpiece. To say that this movie is violent and (I've heard
some people say) scary is completely missing the point. It isn't
scary...it is enlightening. It represents a world that we are all too
scared to be in, a life that we are all to scared too live. This movie
is nothing new, it isn't original or unique. Fight clubs have been
alive and kicking since the first time a man experienced the rush of
adrenaline after he asked his buddy, &quot;I want you to hit me as hard as
you can&quot;. <br /><br />As I quote, &quot;Before young men started scarring kisses into their hands
with lye or Superglue [...] Before you could walk through airports and
hear bogus public address announcements paging 'Tyler Durden...Would
Tyler Durden please pick up the white courtesy phone...' [&#133;] Before all
that...there was just a [seven page] short story.&quot; (Fight Club, the
novel-introduction. Chuck Palahniuk). The book started because Chuck
Palahniuk needed a way to pass the time. The book never was intended to
go very far. The critics hated it, and people were not interested in a
book called 'Fight Club'. Mr. Palahniuk said that he would have done
better with a book entitled: 'Barn-Raising Club'. But it doesn't matter
what the critics think, does it? It matters what the people think&#133;and
they loved it. This book, I feel, is a work of genius. The type of
literary genius that is so carefully avoided by John Steinbeck and
Albert Camus has taken the minds of young boys and conformed it to
think, &quot;We are the all-singing all-dancing crap of the world&quot;.<br /><br />There have been realists in the past, but none so believable as Tyler
Durden. When one sees the movie you cannot help but believe Tyler when
he tells us 'You are not what's in your wallet, you are not your
f**king khakis'. You cannot help but revere him when he tells the store
clerk 'In six weeks, if you are not on your way to becoming a
veterinarian, you will die'. I don't think that they could have cast
the movie any better, either. Brad Pitt is amazingly real. When I saw
the movie, I couldn't help but think that is the way that he truly is.
The narrator plays the sort of pathetic person that would dream up an
imaginary friend to make himself feel better. An unbelievable part
played to perfection. Marla is not a bombshell but seems to be the
perfect fit for a lecherous lady that is the cause for the anguish. <br /><br />It is a work of genius as far as I'm concerned. I am not a critic, I
have no PHD and I am not anyone who truly matters to anyone's personal
opinion. But this movie isn't dark, scary, or cynical if you listen to
what Tyler Durden says. A world where all people are equal, a world of
freedom, a world where you actually live and are not just &quot;a copy of a
copy of a copy&quot;. The fighting is a minute part of this movie in all
actuality. This movie is not about violence...it is about the bonding
of men, the trials of love, the torture of being a bit crazy, but most
of all it is about a world that is not concerned with your status, your
sofa, your cornflower blue tie. THAT is Fight Club, my friends. THAT is
the essence of Tyler Durden.
