I remember for years that this movie kept popping up in my TV guide and
it never was a movie I watched as I thought nothing of it. But after
seeing it plenty of times in 100 movies to see before you die lists I
decided to watch it. In a short space of time Fight Club has become my
favourite movie. It completely blew me away. Amazing performances from
Edward Norton and especially Brad Pitt. The movie(based on Chuck
Palahniuk book with the same title) has an incredible story and the
ending was a complete surprise that I never saw coming and thats all
I&#x27;ll say about that.<br /><br />If you are at all a movie lover, watch this movie, it is sheer genius
and once its over you will be thinking about Fight Club for days
afterwards.
