What do you think of the Fight Club music?
If anyone has heard the Dust Brothers soundtrack, I think it is awesome.
There are some great songs on there, but the best thing about it all is
how
well it fits the movie..
All of the scenes with music are perfect for creating the atmosphere and
feeling that makes the movie so great. My favorite song is the one that
begins right at the end, the Pixies' &quot;Where is My Mind?&quot; That song is just
so dramatic and emotional, and I think it's a magnificent ending for an
amazing film.
