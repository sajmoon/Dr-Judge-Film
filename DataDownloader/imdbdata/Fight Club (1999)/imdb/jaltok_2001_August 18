The only basis on calling this character Jack is when he is mimicking those
point of view pieces on anatomy, etc.<br /><br />NEVER is the main character actually called Jack, in fact, he never uses
real names. (as far as i can tell)<br /><br />I believe this was intended as a stylistic element, as the credits list him
only as Narrator<br /><br />in the book, it is done this way as well (the author writes screenplays as
well, and wrote the screenplay for this movie as well, of
course)
