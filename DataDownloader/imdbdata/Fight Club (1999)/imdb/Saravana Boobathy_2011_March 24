Another David Fincher&#x27;s Masterpiece .. Edward norton and Bradpitt both
are amazing pair. they have done a very good job. after watching fight
club i couldn&#x27;t relieve from the fear for three days. bcz all are
exposed their excellent performance. about the story Edward Norton have
two different personalities. one is normal life as the narrator( Edward
norton). and another one what he wants to be as Tyler Durden(Brad
pitt). he started act like total stranger. he fight himself and act he
have friend name Tyler Durden. he also had a girl friend Marla Singer.
he used to be work with Soap making Company as paper market company. he
started the fight club in under the bar. after some incidents he
realize he had two personalities. how he take over that, thats the rest
of the story.<br /><br />Edward exposed the excellent performance. Brad pitt is chance-less
performance. Really i enjoyed the movie. Must watch
