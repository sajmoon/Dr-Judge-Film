this is a movie for people who love fighting and gangster type movies...it
is such a good movie that i can't even explain it in words! brad pit and
ed
norton are cool in it...and it has some twisted parts, and the ending is
awesome, in the beginning 10 or 20 minutes u will think that it is a
boring
movie...believe me u'll love it in the end.
