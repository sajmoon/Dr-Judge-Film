I avoided this movie for a long time, assuming it to be just another
Patrick Swayze-'Roadhouse'-type &quot;chick-flick&quot;: you know, where a bunch
of pretty boys with greased chests preen and posture, until the
prettiest of them all finally wins the heart of the poor, threatened
damsel.<br /><br />Could I possibly have been any more wrong?<br /><br />This is one of the finest examples of intelligent film-making I have
ever seen, as well as the most compelling piece of storytelling I can
think of.<br /><br />The cast shine brightly, especially Edward Norton, who turns in a
near-flawless performance; and what a shock to discover that Brad Pitt
*can* act, after-all!<br /><br />Visually beautiful, expertly crafted sound, with a splendid overall
ambiance as a result.<br /><br />From a narrative perspective, the plot 'twist' is interesting, but I
feel it is of lesser importance than the message which, paradoxically,
should repel me the most - that the current generation of western men
have been socially and emotionally emasculated by a cartel of
too-powerful and domineering women, and unjust laws and privileges
bestowed upon females by a society petrified of being branded
Politically Incorrect.<br /><br />As a woman, I naturally and instinctively object to such ideas, but as
an honest and intelligent person, not yet fully blinded by propaganda
and femmo-Nazi mind-control methods, I have to regretfully concede some
truth to it. Men ain't what they used to be.<br /><br />And whilst I don't miss the &quot;women as chattels&quot; mentality of days of
yore, nor the old tendency of authority to turn a blind-eye to the
likes of domestic abuse, I can't help but think of the words to a
particularly apt song: &quot;Where Have All The Cowboys Gone&quot;?<br /><br />'Fight Club' gives me some hope that perhaps, somewhere out there, men
are thinking about being men again. As a woman, I welcome the concept.<br /><br />'Fight Club' should be viewed, not just as a superlative piece of
film-making, nor as a brutal and bloody piece of entertainment, but as
a clarion call to all people to discard the fear of the accountants and
managers, and learn to be independent individuals once more.<br /><br />10 out of 10. Period.
