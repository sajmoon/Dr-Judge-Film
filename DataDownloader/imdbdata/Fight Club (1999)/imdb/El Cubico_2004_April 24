My my, this must be one of the best films ever made. Beautiful camera
work/flights, amazing storyline, amazing acting, impressive cinematography
in general, and the list goes on and on and on. There's almost nothing to
criticise here. I've just watched it for the second time and it was even
more impressive than the first time. Of course, people with weak stomachs
watching the uncut version of this masterpiece might have some problems
processing it. This is definately 18+ imho.<br /><br />Some people will immediately call Fight Club violent, disgusting, repulsing,
and/or cruel, but those of course didn't have an eye on the actual qualities
of this movie. They range from brilliant acting and even more brilliant
filming to many hidden messages and to some covered social critisicm
contained by it as well.<br /><br />My overall rating: 9.5/10. Highly recommended!! I won't rate the individual
components of Fight Club since they'd all receive 9.5 to
10.<br /><br />The only thing that got a 10 from me so far is Band of
Brothers.
