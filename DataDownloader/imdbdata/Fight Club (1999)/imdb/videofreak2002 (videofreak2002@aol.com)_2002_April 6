&quot;Fight Club&quot; became one of the weirdest movies back in 1999.  Starring Brad
Pitt, Edward Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, Jared Leto, and Meat Loaf, and
directed by David Fincher, didn't do to well by the critics, but, got mixed
reviews by the audiences because of the story and the way it was made.  At
first, I thought this movie would suck.  But, I checked it out and it was an
OK movie.  But, I watched it more than once, the movie's in my list of
all-time favorite movies.  It was a weird movie, but, it was well-made. 
David Fincher did a good job again with his camera work, the performances by
the main and supporting actors were extraordinary, and the music (composed
by The Dust Brothers) had a very good mix to it.  This movie was great.  If
you like weird movies, then you'll enjoy &quot;Fight Club.&quot; <br /><br />A+ 13/13 ****** (out of ****** stars)
