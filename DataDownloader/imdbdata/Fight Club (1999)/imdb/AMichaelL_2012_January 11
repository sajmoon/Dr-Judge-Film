When I first saw Fight Club, I was 13. I was so in awe by the shocking
twists that I hardly understood the bigger picture. When re-watching,
every year since, sometimes multiple times, I always find my position
in life determines how I view the movie. It is always a great movie,
based on one of the better philosophy books written in the modern day
(yes, Fight Club is a philosophy book, no arguments), but sometimes I
view the characters with differing amounts of sympathy. Sometimes I
wish I could join Project Mayhem, sometimes I am so glad I can&#x27;t. But
through and through this movie is anti-consumer, and it examines the
way we have muddled ourselves into these collections of corporate
brands as personalities, and it has never been done in a better way,
before or since.<br /><br />I had never had the revelation that capitalism was evil and that
actions are usually motivated by a want rather a need, until I saw this
movie, and even at 13, I realized how gravely applicable this message
was to our culture.<br /><br />This is, still, one of the best movies around. It has insane
entertainment value, and somehow, right in plain sight for all to see,
it proclaims that capitalism has failed us all (and rightly so). Marx
would be proud!
