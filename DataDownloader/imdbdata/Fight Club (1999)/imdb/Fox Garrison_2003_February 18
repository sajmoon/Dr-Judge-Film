Imagine a year when the Sopranos were born, when a man goes through a
rebirth in American Beauty, when Magnolia is more than just a
flower-1999-the year Fight Club was started.<br /><br />I am driven to believe 1999 was a hallmark year for movies and Fight Club
was no exception.  Edward Norton and Brad Pitt star in a movie about a bunch
of guys living the vida loca in underground street fighting.  At first
glance the movie could be passed off as mere tripe hadn't you looked
closer.<br /><br />It's taken me a long time to figure out what to write for Fight Club.  I
mean it isn't everyday a movie comes out and changes who you are and makes
you believe that there is more to life then just the breath away from death
that we are.  Indeed, I don't know how to explain it better than to say
Fight Club makes you think about who you are and what your purpose in the
world is irrespective of the fact that others around you are doing the same
thing.  In other words, it brings a sense of awe to life that it reduces you
to the common gene pool we all came from at one point in history.  Anyway,
that is what I got out of it.<br /><br />The film was shot with a gritty, green filter that renders everything
aesthetically street-real.  I can liken the filtering system to that of
Hart's War.  If you had seen Hart's War then you would know that it had a
blue tinge that gave it a cold dark feel.  In Fight Club the mood is more
industrial and grimy, hence the filter.  The film also features classic
rebel costumes that are subdued by way of lighting.  In fact much of the
clothes are not out on display much like other movies since the clothes
either have an unkempt look or are not being worn at all.  This movie's
costumes are definitely not the Grease type of clothing.<br /><br />The sound is incredible, from sounds of fists hitting raw meat to blood
splattering on the floor.  This movie is not for the faint of heart.  The
sounds only enhance the realism of the fights in that if the fights aren't
watched they can still be heard adequately to surmise the
outcome.<br /><br />The story is what makes this movie special.  As I had mentioned, this movie
came out in 1999, a time when the end of the world was at hand.  I'd like to
think though that 1999 was a time when movies really had something to say
about the society we built for ourselves.  The Sopranos did this by showing
the world really was dependent on a sub-culture of humanity that tailored
its businesses to human vices.  American Beauty showed that our lives are a
pink slip away from true living, true being.  Magnolia's assault on
society's morals are shattered by the film's often times relapse to parental
affection.  And what of Fight Club?  A film that embraces the idea that
there is a life if we lose all that we have to gain all that we can.  Fight
Club goes beyond simple movie making by showing us what we can achieve if we
step out of ourselves-if we act on the thought-if we live by our
dreams.
