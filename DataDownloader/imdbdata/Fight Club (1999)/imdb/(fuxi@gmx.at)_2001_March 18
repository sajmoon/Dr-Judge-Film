camera moving in never seen ways, 
acting good enough to mention it, 
electronic soundtrack outstanding and flowing with the movie,<br /><br />meaningful, 
much much more than just violence, 
never predictable storyline, 
wonderful monologues, 
deep atmosphere, 
see it twice, 
one of the best, 
just my opinion.
