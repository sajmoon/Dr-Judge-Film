I would say that this is one of the most underrated movies of last decade,
which hasn't get by critics the acclaim (and the awards) it deserved. Brad
Pitt delivers an excellent, amazing, Oscar winning performance here, one
of
his best to date. The same goes for Edward Norton, too. The direction by
David Fincher is masterly and the dark cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth
is
absolutely functional. I firmly believe that Fight Club is one of the best
movies in the cinema history.<br /><br />The film doesn't just reflect like a mirror the dysfunction of our society
but enlarges it like a magnifying glass (as art should always do). At
first
it starts as a strong social comment on how the modern materialistic,
consumer, full of angst way of life alienates and isolates people, making
their spirit passive and deadening their soul, leading them ultimately to
find out ways (even extreme and violent ones) to communicate with their
emotions again. Then it shows how the combative dispute and resistance to
such a situation may end in anarchy and mayhem, and how anarchy may
finally
result in a kind of totalitarianism. During its last forty minutes the
movie
becomes a breathtaking psychological thriller with one of the most
original
and stirring finales I've ever seen.<br /><br />This movie is fairly reckoned the Clockwork Orange of 90's. It's a
masterpiece that you shouldn't miss.<br /><br />My rate: 10 out of 10
