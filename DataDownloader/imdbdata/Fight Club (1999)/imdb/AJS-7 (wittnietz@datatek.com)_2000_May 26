Geared toward the young professional male and the sheer despair in the
search for meaning in life, this film exposes the lies of both consumerism
and so-called &quot;spirituality&quot; that so pervades middle-class life. Instead
of
turning to meditation, crystals, chakras, self-help groups and other
New-Age
dreck, *Fight Club* unflinchingly turns toward the material--meaning is
found through mutually-consentual physical suffering. In a life so
anxiously
inured from any physical discomfort as the yuppie life is, the narrator
(Edward Norton) seeks refuge not in enlightenment through spiritual
uplifting, but through material degradation.<br /><br />The one thing that most Americans hate to face is the very fact of their
own
materiality and mortality--*Fight Club* forces them to acknowledge it
without resorting to time-worn situations such as war, economic hardship,
or
old age. Only when one gives up the narcissistic fascination with one's
own
comfort does one truly confront one's mortality--and, by extension, one's
vitality.<br /><br />Why the choice of soap for Tyler Durden's (Brad Pitt) trade? If, as Freud
(and others) noted that soap is the marker of civilization, this film
exposes that this marker is at base just as barbaric as the civilization
on
which it purports to depend. If one is not utterly revolted by the scene
in
which the raw materials for Durden's trade are gathered, one isn't
human.<br /><br />Brad Pitt and Edward Norton give outstanding performances, and David
Fincher's astonishing technical mastery and excellent penchant for dark
moods (as well as dark humor) takes what could in others' hands be a
moralistic didacticism and crafts a magnificent document of both despair
and
hope (although not the kind of hope one would expect).<br /><br />This is not a film for those looking for mere entertainment nor for those
who are satire-impaired (i.e. those who, after seeing the film want to
start
a fight club of their own); but those looking for a film that is both
visually stunning and thoughtful should view it immediately.
