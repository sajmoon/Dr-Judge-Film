Fight Club is a movie of two halves. The first half establishes Edward
Norton's 
character as dissatisfied with his life and his small job in a large
organization. 
His initial response is to participate in support groups, which provide the<br /><br />emotional support lacking in the rest of his life. After a fire damages his
home, 
however, rather than looking to any of the people he met in those groups, he<br /><br />seeks out Brad Pitt, whom he previously met only briefly, but who offers a
more 
satisfying way out of the drab pettiness of his life. It is from the
interactions 
between Norton and Pitt that the Fight Club develops. The tangible contact
of 
fighting and feeling pain revitalizes Norton's life, and gives it a meaning<br /><br />previously lacking.<br /><br />Although it is extremely violent and includes graphic portrayals of the
effects of 
the fights, I enjoyed the movie to this point. It explores a theme that
Pitt's 
character makes explicit when he talks about fighting as a means of
recovering 
a masculine identity in a culture in which young men are brought up and<br /><br />feminised by, and also implicitly betrayed by, overexposure to women as<br /><br />mothers and teachers. The reduction of Norton to a weak, needy consumer is<br /><br />the outcome of that process. I was looking forward to the development of
that 
theme when the film began its shift into the main feature of the second half
- the 
exploration of individual psychopathology. I am being deliberately vague
here 
because I don't want to give away detail that will spoil the film for some,
but I 
found this aspect of the film less satisfying. This was partly because it is
not a 
particularly good account of a dissociative disorder, but also because I was<br /><br />enjoying the themes of the first part of the film and wanted to see them
given 
prominence.<br /><br />However, there was still much that I enjoyed about the whole movie. I
thought 
that all performances were very well done - not just the main characters,
but 
some of the minor characters such as Norton's boss. It was fun to see Helena<br /><br />Bonham Carter doing a fine job of portraying a deranged slut after seeing
her in 
highly mannered costume dramas. Finally, the cinematography and direction<br /><br />help sustain dramatic tension throughout the movie. 7 /
10.
