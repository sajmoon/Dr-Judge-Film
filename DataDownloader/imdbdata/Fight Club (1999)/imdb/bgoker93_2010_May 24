As I said on the title, my thought is that this is the best film ever
made. The acting, directing, filming is superb. You never get bored of
the film, and it makes you think twice about your life, your job,
habits etc.<br /><br />The main character&#x27;s name is never heard in the entire film, he
introduces himself by different names in different places such as
Cornelius, Rupert, Travis,... Whatever, this guy , whom I&#x27;m going to
call the narrator after now, meets a cool, unusual person named Tyler
Durden. After meeting him his condo gets burned and somehow he stays
for a while at Tyler&#x27;s place and hangs around with Tyler all the time.<br /><br />Tyler - who is directly the Fight Club&#x27;s philosophy - is a symbol
anti-capitalism, anti-materialism, an over-the-system lifestyle. He
also has similar thoughts and ideas as Nietzsche&#x27;s(we can see him
quoting from Nietzsche in the film).<br /><br />While spending time with Tyler, the Narrator&#x27;s life totally changes; he
starts being a tough guy, he doesn&#x27;t have any worries no more - He hits
the bottom -. Well that&#x27;s the ideal person for Tyler, a human being
which has nothing to lose, only to win.<br /><br />Nearing the end of the film the narrator realizes that actually Tyler
is his imaginary friend, after a while foe, and some events occur...
Well, in the end he shoots himself in his own mouth and weirdly results
as himself living, however Tyler dead.<br /><br />There are a lot of references and symbols of the philosophy which I
mentioned earlier. And also there are great and unforgettable scenes,
in example the ending scene, the collapse of the credit card companies&#x27;
buildings -the utopia of Tyler Durden.<br /><br />While watching this film, you won&#x27;t get bored for sure, the events are
occurring in an amusing, yet engrossing way. And as I mentioned at the
beginning of the review, Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Carter do
quite good, and of course David Fincher; the film is well-made and
extremely fun. In my opinion it&#x27;s the best, and you should watch it
asap or you&#x27;ll miss a lot.
