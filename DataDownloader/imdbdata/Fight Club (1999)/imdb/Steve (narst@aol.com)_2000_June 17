This film was robbed of the nomination for best picture and best director.
But most of all Edward Norton gives one of the best performances of the
last
five years and was not recognized by the academy. This is one film that
really wasn't made for box office. It is just out there to get it's message
out. And this is one great movie. The ending is amazing. It's very sixth
sense like. It also has great music especially the song played at the end
is
perfect. ****
