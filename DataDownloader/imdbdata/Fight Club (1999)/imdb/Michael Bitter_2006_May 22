Some people don&#39;t realize the violence at all, some does too well. This
is like a movie of what would happen if suddenly something snaps in an
brilliant office workers head. Too easy job, too much brains, no sleep.<br /><br />I kind of got similar to the main character, I had sleeping problems
like 6 months and between that time I saw this movie. It really freaked
me out because I was feeling exactly the same way.<br /><br />You might think that movie called like Fight Club cannot get deep in
your mind. Don&#39;t underestimate The Fight Club. Try to use your brains
if you have ones when watching, otherwise you lose a lot. Movie
actually goes so deep that you might get wondering about most of the
ppl who go to work everyday and might not realize it&#39;s the last day of
their lives. from eight to four, every weekday, working overtime, like
getting nowhere but still doing work. Buying everything, believing it
makes you feel good.<br /><br />Can&#39;t say much about this movie without spoilers so watch it or miss
it. One of the best movies I&#39;ve seen and kind of messes around with
your head especially if you&#39;re a movie freak. Most artistic etc. movies
makes you think lots of ideas and conclusions for everything but really
doesn&#39;t give any answer, like wondering blind and trying to figure out
what might be happening. Here you find at least answers, better look at
least few times if you liked it first time.
