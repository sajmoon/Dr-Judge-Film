An interesting adaptation from the book.  Both are good, but don't see one
without reading the other.  What Fight Club so intelligently and
refreshingly acknowledges about being a young man in today's world more
than
makes up for the movies' shortcomings.  Let's face it: we're all
mortgaging
the happiness of our souls by working jobs we don't really like.  We do
this
in exchange for the opportunity buy crap we hope will self express
ourselves
and makes us feel unique...just like everyone else.  The vicious cycle is
causing us more harm than any of us want to admit.  We're are too afraid
to
break it, so we carry on and continue our search for whatever coping
mechanisms help us deal with it.  Then along came Fight Club.  For the
first
time (as far as I know) somebody found a novel way to talk about it.  And
overcoming the fear of fist fighting with total strangers couldn't be more
brilliant as the ultimate coping mechanism.<br /><br />My biggest complaint about this movie was that it was too stylized - so
much
so that I couldn't help but think some might accuse its anti-consumerism
rants of being somewhat hypocritical.  Sure Brad Pitt looked like a dirty
scum bag, but that was a carefully contrived &quot;scum style&quot; you were looking
at.<br /><br />Notwithstanding those subtle dashes of Hollywood that, to me, seemed to
sober the movies' message, both Brad Pitt and Ed Norton gave fantastic,
believable performances.  They helped make this story, this idea, a highly
authentic experience.  I am actually quite surprised this movie didn't
create more buzz when it was in theatres. I can see the back half of the
movie might have been where many people started to lose interest (I admit
it
weakens as the whole Project Mayhem stuff unfolds), but that first sixty
minutes is all you really need to see as far as I'm concerned.  The power
of
that piece alone leads me to believe that Fight Club is one seriously
under
appreciated movie.  I think its legacy will start to shine the more we
reflect on what it had to say.  Give it a second try, and give it
time.<br /><br />
