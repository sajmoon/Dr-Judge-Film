We all knew David Fincher could make a second trip to the well.  Se7en
proved Alien3 was a film by committee screw-up, and Fight Club reveals The
Game to be nothing more than post-phenomenon jitters.  Phew.  But Fincher
does more than merely demonstrate his cinematic nerve; with Fight Club he
recalibrates the term controversy, taking a disturbing, savagely
intelligent, ferociously funny trip into the life of the mind.  Violence and
chuckles in the same film?  No wonder the papers had such hissy-fits.<br /><br />Jack (Edward Norton) is reaching critical exasperation with his white-collar
job and lifestyle.  A chronic insomniac, he begins crashing various group
therapy courses at a local church, maintaining critical distance through a
wry voiceover.<br /><br />Fight Club is intoxicating, its humour the blackest kind, the violence never
less than bone crunching.  At the end of the millennium, with no wars to
fight and no cause to champion, the suggestion that a fight club answers
men's cries for freedom from the hell of 9-5 is heady stuff.  But Fight Club
is not a threat to society anymore than Natural Born Killers or A Clockwork
Orange were.  With a level of realism pitched at hyper, the film is more a
joyride for the brain than a call to arms.<br /><br />As a director Fincher does not let the adrenalin high drop once, using
combinations of cinematic left hooks and upper cuts.  Camera's plunge thirty
storeys, travel through a character's brain, are on the receiving end of
vicious blows, are addressed directly by Jack and finally shake with the
giddiness of it all.  The Dust Brothers' frenzied, schizophrenic score, and
Jim Uhls' script, a superb adaptation from Chuck Palahniuk's book,
complement this visual overload.<br /><br />Pitt again proves he is Fincher's boy, while Norton deserves Oscar
recognition for his multi-layered turn.  Even English rose Bonham-Carter
convinces, as does Meatloaf as Bob.<br /><br />Fight Club also contains the best twist since Dudley Smith shot Jack
Vincennes.  Unbelievably attacked from all quarters, this plot turn adds yet
more dimensions to the insanity of modern man.  Just don't let anyone reveal
it to you.<br /><br />Fight Club then: it's dark, it's disturbing and unsettling.  For better or
worse it's a guy film, a wonderfully creative nightmare.  It will be the
best ruck you've had in ages.
