Fight Club will leave you beaten and bloodied at the end of the
climatic twist ending, and wondering &#x22;How did I get here?&#x22; Fight
Club(1999) is a very rare movie, not many movies are like this one.
Hollywood Directors now days like &#x22;Action&#x22; and &#x22;guns&#x22; to entertain
their viewers, in other words, simple movies for a simple audience.
This is a very complex movie. I rate my movies in 4 categories;
Cintemography,Film making,Acting and the overall experience.<br /><br />Cintemography: I have never seen Cintemography quite like this. The
picture is very rare, Fincher made the characters look &#x22;Shiny&#x22; when
they are around Tyler, to show how he makes an impact on the film, and
everything is bland when he isn&#x27;t there. Everything looks beautiful.
Fincher has used specific things to make the movie more enjoyable, like
overtones. (Now I wont say anything because it may spoil it) He has
used many visual techniques to make this film more enjoyable, and in a
sense, more pretty. 25/25<br /><br />Film making: The camera angles, the direction in this is just right,
brilliant. He has everything timed out correctly, nothing out of sync,
to make full effect of conversations and fight scenes. The choreography
in the fight scenes are very realistic, the fight co-coordinator for
the film watched many boxing matches and took martial arts lessons to
get this right, and so it payed off really well. 25/25<br /><br />Acting: The Acting is one of the major parts about the film. This has
got to be the best acting I have ever see, Pitt plays an evil and
sinister, yet intelligent and charismatic soap salesman, where as
Edward Norton plays a depressed unnamed social worker who satisfies
himself with support groups. There are many more who are just as good,
like Helena Bonham Carter and Meat Loaf. 25/25<br /><br />Overall Experience: This movie, as long as you have an out-of-the-box
mind and a wild imagination, will never bore you, how many times you
have watched it. Its a very complex movie that touches you very deeply
, and it has a very good meaning. 25/25<br /><br />Overall score: 100/100
