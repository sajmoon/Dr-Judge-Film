Can anyone really believe that Edward Norton is capable of holding his own
in a fight? If you can get over this major credibility hurdle then this film
is quite acceptable being a curiously-different black comedy with some great
dramatic elements. Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter provide sound
support.One criticism I have is that the movie is too long and loses
direction in the second half, with one not sure where the plot is heading. A
pruning of length would have helped. Oh yes,and we can't forget that Meat
Loaf plays a guy with breasts. Mind you it is a tough guy with breasts that
he plays. I wonder how his agent described the part to him.&quot;Hey, Meat, got a
great part for ya! Big budget Hollywood movie. Brad Pitt's in it.It's a
fight movie. Your part? well you play a tough guy with boobies.It'll pay
well though.&quot;
