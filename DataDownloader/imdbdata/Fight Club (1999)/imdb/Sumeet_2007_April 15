I saw the reviews before watching the movie..reviews and comments were
G8.It was also in the &quot;top movie list&quot; So I expected that this is going
to be a rally G8 movie But disappointing....<br /><br />The movie is a bit slow at the starting..The in the middle it suddenly
catches the speed,and everything changes. The story is really confusing
at some parts.At least difficult to understand at the first watch.You
need to think what&#39;s going on.And when you start getting the things,The
story takes a U Turn. And you are completely messed up with the story
again.<br /><br />The action scenes are good (although the movie doesn&#39;t contain many
scenes as per the name &quot;FIGHT CLUB&quot;),The direction, acting.. everything
is good.<br /><br />So if you really want to enjoy the movie don&#39;t stress at your BRAIN too
much.Just enjoy and accept whats going on without going in much detail.
