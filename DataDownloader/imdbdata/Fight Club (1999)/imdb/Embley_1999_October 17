1999_October 17 

S**t - I had a whole review written and then I accidentally hit escape and
erased the whole thing.<br /><br />Basically Fight Club was bad.  Which is really unfortunate because I was
looking forward to another great film from David Fincher.<br /><br />I read over some of the other comments made by users here, and I was really
surprised that every single one I read was a positive review.  It really
makes me wonder about the film-going public...<br /><br />I actually thought the premise itself was quite interesting - lonely guy
seeks way to connect with other individuals in the modern world.  Going to
the support groups was interesting, forming fight club with &quot;Tyler Durden&quot;
was interesting.  <br /><br />Somehow though I just wish that guys could vent their frustrations or anger
or unhappiness without resorting to violence - though I am starting to see
that is an impossibility.  It must be coded into their genes (which is a
REALLY good excuse - I love that one...)<br /><br />Now don't misunderstand me - I am not squeamish about violence - some of the
fight sequences were well done and I enjoyed them - it is a rare thing that
I will turn my eyes away in horror because of violence - there is a perverse
fascination with it in my psychological make-up and I am certainly not the
only one.  But when I was sitting watching the film (and I honestly wasn't
too thrilled about it already because it was just a bit boring) during the
scene where Edward Norton beats the blond kid to a shadow of his former
self, I became offended.  And not specifically because of the beating.  That
was horrifying and I think (hope?) most people would find it horrifying. 
What offended me was the handful of young men who were whooping and cheering
the beating on from the audience.  That was frightening.<br /><br />I don't think it is arguable that this film does glorify violence in a very
bad way.  It makes it cool to beat people up and to get beaten up. Other
reviews I read argued that it doesn't glorify violence because it makes the
drones in Durden's terrorist army look stupid or something.  Well yes they
do look stupid - I don't think that people go out looking to be a stupid
&quot;drone&quot; but they do look for leadership (ie Nazi Germany).  Furthermore it
seems to me that more people would be interested in being Tyler Durden. 
That is how it glorifies violence with respect to terrorist organizations -
it wouldn't necessarily make you want to follow in one, it makes it look
cool to lead one.  I would like to think that people are not stupid enough
to fall for that kind of thing, but I know I am wrong and I think Fincher
gives the general public to much credit for intelligence and being able to
think on their own.<br /><br />Moving on - I hated the &quot;twist&quot; [details deleted].  How lame, what a predictable cop out.  And I
thought it was poorly done - implausible if you look back at the rest of the
film.  That really put the nails in the coffin of this
film.<br /><br />I actually thought Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham-Carter were
pretty good.  I wonder how different the original screenplay looked from the
finished product.<br /><br />One other thing - I read a review from an LA critic that stated that the
worst thing about this film is that it THINKS it conveys a message.  Close -
I think it TRIES to convey a message but whatever that message was, it is
not effectively conveyed.  Sure it says consumerism ans capitalism are bad,
it then goes on to say fight the system with whatever (violent) means
necessary...  And does not really contradict that message ever.  Is this the
message Fincher intended?  I do not think that Norton's character running
around trying to make things right at the end (when it was clear that that
was impossible) turns around the core message of the film...  What a
disaster.
