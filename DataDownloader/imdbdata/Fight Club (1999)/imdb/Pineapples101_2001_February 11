It really is a rare joy these days to find an itelligent film come out of
the studio controled, 'play it safe' family friendly Hollywood.
Fincer once again shows us that he is one of the most brilliant directors
around, the film holds the attention throughout, with fantastic
performances
from Norten, Pitt &amp; carter, increadible effects and a great ending. And the
second time around that you watch it; it's a totally different
film.
If you havn't seen this film dont listen to all the politically correct
moaners who seem to have really missed the plot, or probably havn't even
seen the film, Fightclub is not theme-wise about fighting/violance etc The
real themes are very complex and very relevent, I couldn't hope to explain
them enough to do this film justice, so you will just have to watch the
film
yourself, just keep an open mind.
My only concern is - can Fincher top it.
