I was impressed by the movie. Dark without being overdone. Bothering to
say some stuff. Making some use of the lack of talent shown by Mr.
Pitt. Everything seemed so good for a Hollywood production. Yet,
something bothered me: Mr. Fincher. He does some moody music videos
which compliment the music. This is what he has done in Fight Club also
- set the mood and the tempo. Yet, all his other pieces longer than 10
minutes stink beyond the visuals. How come? A director so big and fails
short of his objectives? So I finally got myself up to read the book. I
read the book. And, in the beginning, there&#x27;s no director. It&#x27;s only an
illustration of the book - pretty much the same way some nobody is
given some out-of-copyright classical novel to direct as a commission
from some family TV channel. In the end, the director is nothing than a
assistant producer. Once the story in the novel unfolds the changes are
more profound. The same way butcher Scott gutted a Ph. K. Dick novel to
give a love story in some sort of distant dystopia covered all in the
aspartame of SFX, Fincher and his team do bother to tame down the
story, everything below the shallow philosophy is ironed out. The only
thing that team can be proud of is pulling up that ending that would
have been impossible to get past censorship a few years later. But, at
the time, there was nothing so special about it, only dumbing down the
ending to make sure the silly happy end where hero gets the girl and
nothing really happened.<br /><br />Norton does a good job, that would account for about 3 points, and the
fourth is because of the smooth integration of the visuals and
soundtrack. Only one point for that last one as it&#x27;s nothing too hard,
even Peter Jackson can do it.
