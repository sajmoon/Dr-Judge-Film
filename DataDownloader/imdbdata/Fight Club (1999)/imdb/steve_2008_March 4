This review is totally and completely unnecessary as everyone should
already know that this is the greatest film of all time. No joke, this
movie completely changed my way of thinking for the better. Tyler
Durdens&#39; (Brad Pitt) philosophy that pretty much amounts to &quot;live fast
and die young&quot; makes for a seriously interesting character. Brad Pitt&#39;s
acting is such that you can actually imagine him AS Tyler Durden.
Perfect casting. The same can be said for Edward Norton, who plays a
role that&#39;s in stark contrast to his character in &quot;American History X&quot;
also delivers a fantastic performance, something I&#39;ve come to expect
from him. Not only is this movie well acted but it&#39;s a story that
really does make you question your philosophy on life up to this point.
Watch this movie, end of story.
