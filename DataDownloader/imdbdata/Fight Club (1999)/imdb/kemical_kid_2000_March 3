I guess the only thing that I want to say about this movie is that it is
absolutely spectacular.  The pairing up of Norton and Pitt is superb.  I
urge anybody who still believes that this movie is only about Neanderthals
punching each other in dirty old basements to actually watch it learn that
it is an amazing story about those grey sludge puddles in ourselves that
people like to just walk around.  Best black-comedy ever made, and in the
time of twisted endings there is no way that Fight Club can be
beat.
