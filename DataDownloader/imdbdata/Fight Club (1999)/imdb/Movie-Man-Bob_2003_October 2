WARNING! SPOILERS FOLLOW. <br /><br />I saw Fight Club a month or two back, and was kind of unimpressed with
it. It was a decently made film, with good acting and good directing...
but something about it just didn't quite work for me. That is until I
began to examine it more closely. Then I realized what it really is:
It's not a life-altering drama or a vicious black comedy, as it is
proclaimed to be... rather, it is a cleverly disguised attempt to bring
one of the greatest comic strips of all time to the big screen. <br /><br />That's right, Fight Club is really an adaptation of Calvin and Hobbes.
Just take a look at the similarities... <br /><br />Fight Club: The Narrator (hereinafter &quot;Jack&quot;) feels depressed and
alone, which leads to his fabricating Tyler Durden, a friend and
companion who is everything Jack wishes he could be. <br /><br />Calvin and Hobbes: Calvin has no friends, which leads to his projecting
everything he wishes he could be into his stuffed tiger, who becomes
his friend and companion Hobbes. <br /><br />Fight Club: When Jack looks at Tyler, he sees Tyler. When anyone else
looks at Tyler, they see Jack. <br /><br />Calvin and Hobbes: When Calvin looks at Hobbes, he sees a tiger. When
anyone else looks at Hobbes, they see a stuffed toy. <br /><br />Fight Club: Jack simultaneously detests Marla and desires her. He
projects his desire through Tyler, though in several scenes we see this
desire in Jack himself. <br /><br />Calvin and Hobbes: Calvin simultaneously detests Susie and desires her.
Throughout the course of the strip, we see this desire manifested in
Hobbes. But in the very early episodes, Calvin expresses the same
desire himself, if only to himself. <br /><br />Fight Club: Jack expresses his dissatisfaction with his father, and the
job he did as a parent.<br /><br />Calvin and Hobbes: Calvin frequently speaks of his father doing poorly
in the &quot;polls&quot;. <br /><br />Fight Club: While at work, Jack is under the thumb of a demanding boss,
whom he does not like. <br /><br />Calvin and Hobbes: While at school, Calvin is under the thumb of Miss
Wormwood, a demanding teacher whom he does not like. <br /><br />Fight Club: When frustrated with the world around him, Jack goes to a
place in his imagination (that place with the penguin) where all around
him things are serene. <br /><br />Calvin and Hobbes: When frustrated with the world around him, Calvin
goes to places in his imagination, where he is Spaceman Spiff, Tracer
Bullet, Stupendous Man, etc.<br /><br />So, thus we see that, though Bill Waterson himself forbad the filming
of his strip, a few brave men had the courage to go behind his back and
do what they felt was right. Never has there been such a courageous act
by filmmakers since the days of Nosferatu, which was another
thinly-disguised attempt to bring a beloved character to the screen...
Count Chocula.
