...it's difficult to see why neither the author of the
book(apparently,) or the director of the movie, showed the Racism at
the core of the demolition of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City
(Alfred P. Murrah Building.)<br /><br />Nor does the director tackle the question of how conveniently
Nichols/McVeigh/Nichols? might have hatched their conspiracy as a
result of their upbringing in the military...[two or more of the
Oklahoma City bombing conspirators were in the same military unit]
whereas the violence in Fight Club stems from the underclass, urban
anonymity and their marginal jobs and lives.<br /><br />Then again, ==it's a movie...a work of Fiction!!--like the NOVEL from
whence it was derived. [It has, judging by the amount of postings on
the boards, touched a chord.]<br /><br />Richard
