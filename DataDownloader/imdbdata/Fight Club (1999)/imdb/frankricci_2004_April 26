I don't understand why some people don't like this movie. No, no. Let me
rephrase that. I cannot understand how some people don't like this movie.
It's incomprehensible. This was a stroke of genius, and so was the book,
by
Chuck Palahniuk. In fact, the book was much better than the movie, but the
movie was still really good. Reading the book only after having seen David
Fitcher's base, I can only say that it has not ruined it for me AT ALL.
The
book gives a different insight and by God, if you don't like this movie,
I'd
have to guess you have no philosophy or morals or values you live by,
which
would pretty much make you... an animal? :P<br /><br />&quot;Look! Two women f***ing a polar bear!&quot; Hunter S. Thompson
