about senseless world, escape and refuge. about reality as puzzle of
fiction. about freedom in a form behind any definition. a book, a
movie. and levels of self exploration. a cruel fairy tale and usual
fight against system. victories and surrenders. prey and run from usual
cages. a film who must see. not for story or acting or fight scenes, or
relation with a kind of Matrix, not as medicine for frustrations or
fake liberation after a work day. but for the image of society roots.
lost senses, strange acts, childish solutions. and for fragility of
strong terminal. and for a Brad Pitt like seductive Mefistofel. that is
all !
