2001_August 7 

This film has to be one of the best films ever made.  Edward Norton is
brilliant, Brad Pitt is better than ever, and it is one of the most
audacious and relentlessly intelligent movies I have ever had the privilege
to see.  Some have compared it to 'Memento', but may I remind people that
'Memento' is a terrible, uniquely awful piece of film making, and 'Fight
Club' is truly brilliant.
