I saw this movie only because i had herd so much about it and wanted to c
what all the fuss was about, and i can safely say if i hadnt have seen
this
movie, i wud still be the same person i used to be!!<br /><br />The first time i watched it, i watched it at a distance, didnt take much
notice of everything that went off, as u generally do. I have to say, i
thought the plot was so origional and so different from  anything i had
ever
seen, and i also love the fact that the name of the movie &quot;Fight Club&quot;
isn't
the main focus of the whole film. I was so surprised at the ending, i did
not see that one coming! The second time i watched it everything fell into
place, and i enjoyed it the second time round rather than the
first!<br /><br />It made me realise there is more to life than just people who put on acts
to
please people, and people who work their asses off to please people too.
It
made me see the whole movie world in a different way, as in things may not
always be what they seem, and this applied to what goes off in the real
world too.<br /><br />I love how in the first half an hour or so you see Tyler flash in and out
of
parts, and you see him in the back ground, but you wonder y?! I love this
film, and could never get bored of watching it. Ever.
