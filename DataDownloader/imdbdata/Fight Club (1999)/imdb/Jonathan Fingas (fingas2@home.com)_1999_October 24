1999_October 24 

There are some movies which impress you initially, but end up being somewhat
hollow afterwards; then there are movies which demand that you sit up and
take notice.<br /><br />Yes, that's pretty much Fight Club in a nutshell.  I found coming home from
the theatre that I was outright excited by the movie, and it even did what
very few movies do: force me to look at my own behaviour under the
microscope.  It's not just entertainment anymore, it's serving a useful
purpose - and as such I gave it a very high rating (9/10).<br /><br />Why not a perfect mark?  I must confess, the latter part of the movie was
somewhat confusing; thankfully, they brought it back into focus soon enough.
I for one didn't mind the ending at all; it's ambiguous and satisfying for
me at the same time.<br /><br />I'd really recommend seeing this movie; it's a tremendous breather after a
summer full of horrible attempts at entertainment.  I can't believe anyone
went to see Wild Wild West - but if you went to see Fight Club, you're
probably not the kind who would see Wild Wild West to begin with,  in other
words, you're prime material for what Tyler wants in a person.
