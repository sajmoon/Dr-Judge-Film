2000_May 8 

When I first saw this film I didn't know what to expect.  But on the whole I
think that this is a very clever movie and has a strange twist at the end
and if you watch this then you'll know what I mean.<br /><br />The basic story is about the life of a man called Tyler Durben (Brad Pitt)
who is a single self employed soap seller. He is into soap, sex,
explosives and fight club. Fight club being a club where men can release
their stress by bare fist fighting in cellars and back alleys all over
American which becomes an anarchist group who reek havoc across America and
try to break away and destroy the system. This film portrays the dark side
of America. This is a film which is really worth watching as it is in a
league of it's own. I would compare this film to Brett Easton Ellis'
American Psycho as they both focus on the dark and dreary side of life which
is not much a part of films today. So I would give this movie 9.2 out of 10
I hope that you enjoy it as I did.
