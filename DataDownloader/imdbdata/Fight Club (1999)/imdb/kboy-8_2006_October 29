Personally, this is one of my favorite movies of all time. Brad Pitt
and Edward Norton are great in it, and the plot and subject is
excellent. This is a must see. I have watched this movie many many
times, and every time it is just a good as the first. I have bought
this movie, and this is a classic to watch with your friends. No matter
how much you dislike fighting, it is hard to not like the movie fight
club. I believe that both Brad Pitt and Edward Norton should have won
Academy Awards for their performances in this movie, not to mention
Helena Bonham Carter did a pretty good job too.If you haven&#39;t seen it
yet, rent it or buy it right away.
