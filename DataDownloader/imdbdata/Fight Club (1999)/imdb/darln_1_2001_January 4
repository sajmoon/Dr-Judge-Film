Admittedly, I've never been a fan of Brad Pitt so I didn't expect to like
this movie when I rented it.  I assumed that the movie would be a shallow
display of street-fighting -- guys going around and breaking stuff and
causing mischief.<br /><br />To my surprise, I really enjoyed the movie.  Edward Norton's commentary
throughout the film was excellent and it was both easy and fun to relate
to
his character (the calm one).  It kind of reminded me of Trainspotting
except without the thick accent.<br /><br />Since then, I've watched the movie at least 3 times and never get tired of
it.<br /><br />Ladies, don't go thinking that this isn't just a guy's movie because my
wife
loved the movie too! (maybe it was just because Brad Pitt was in
it?)<br /><br />
