This is simply put one of the best films I have ever seen. The actors are
excellent, the script is witty and uncomfortably accurate at times, and the
direction is amazing.<br /><br />This is probably David Fincher's best work. The direction is good enough as
it is, but he still pulls out visually audatious effects that make the film
even better! Take the opening scene, where the camera zooms out through a
human brain until we're staring down the barrel of a gun. And that's just
the first shot!<br /><br />Pitt is good as Tyler, in probably one of his best performances yet. He
comes across as both a bit insane and very smart, at the same time, under a
mask of coolness. That has to be impressive!<br /><br />Bonham-Carter is also very good as Marla, and you have to give her credit
when she is basically the only female character in the
film.<br /><br />However, it is Edward Norton who really excells in this film. One of the
best acting performances I have ever seen. He is just so cool, which I know
it hardly a good way to review it, but it is true!<br /><br />I was quite surprised that this film was snubbed by the Oscars, but I guess
that a film that attacks society is hardly going to be rewarded by the
Academy - wealthy people who believe they have more of a right to decide
what is good than us! Besides, don't let the lack of box-office success
bother you. In a few years time, this film will have cult status and be a
modern classic.<br /><br />The one negative point I can offer, is the film will never ever be able to
give you the initial rush you get when you see it for the first time. I
entered the cinema with little background knowledge, and pretty average
expectations, which helped to enhance the film in my opinion.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest irony though, is that this film provokes debate and
conversation so much. My friends and I still talk about it now, months
after
seeing it!<br /><br />The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight
Club.<br /><br />See the film, and I bet you'll be breaking the rule the second it
finishes.
