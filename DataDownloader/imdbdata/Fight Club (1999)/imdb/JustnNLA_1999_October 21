1999_October 21 

Admittedly, I would have never gone to see Fight Club if it hadn't been part
of a class I'm taking at USC, but this film makes you wonder what it takes
for the MPAA not to give a film an R rating. It's so gratuitously violent
and downright gross (even in non-violent scenes) that Pulp Fiction looks
tame by comparison.<br /><br />Seriously, it's hyped as a violent film about non-violence, but isn't that
akin to saying a film with gratuitous sex can be about abstinence. Sure, I
guess it could, but you'd be hard pressed to find an example, just as I find
it hard to believe that anyone honestly thinks this film is more than a
glorified Faces Of Death with big name actors.<br /><br />I don't know what else to say, but keep your kids (and yourself) away from
this film.
