 Brad Pitt and David Fincher must be laughing right now. Together they have
created two of Hollywood's most dangerous, yet brilliant films-Seven and now
Fight Club.<br /><br /> The story circles around a businessman suffering from insomnia and hating
his job. He finds life joyless and meaningless until he meets Tyler Durden
(Pitt). Together they start a franchise of discontent young men who find
meaning in life by beating each other.<br /><br /> Now this is a worthy storyline for a film that offers two great
performances from Pitt and Mr Controversy himself, Edward Norton (American
History X). However, as the film continues we are no longer with harmless
men beating each other for fun, we are thrust into a sorry whirlpool of
terrorist action and this is when the film loses its grip. They start to
destroy buildings and threaten innocent civilians with guns. This is not the
clever film making that we have seen earlier in the film.<br /><br /> I would warn you that Fight Club is not Snow White, some of the violence is
over the top. For instance Norton beating Angel Face (Jared Leto) into a
bloody pulp is almost unwatchable. <br /><br /> Fight Club has some very funny moments especially the scenes where the
Clubber's mission is to start a fight and lose with a member of the public,
but some of this movie is just violence and a chance for lots of blood and
gore. Helen Bonham Carter and Meat Loaf co star. Rating 3/5
