Fight club is a consumer film for consumer minds, not a mould breaking
masterpiece that attacks our positioning in the modern world. OK, this is
a
bit of a statement, so maybe I should clarify what I'm
saying.<br /><br />Fight Club is what it attacks. Brad Pitt is a beautiful rich successful
man.
For 95% of the film we are led to believe he is the films main
protagonist.
Is this a joke? It is very easy for Brad Pitt to walk all over the world
and
do exactly what he wants, he is perhaps one of the worlds most free men. I
don't care that five minutes from the end I find out that he is the
imaginary creation of Edward Norton, because the first 95% is destroyed
because Pitt is a leader at all, and I hated the film for it.<br /><br />Hollywood Board meeting:<br /><br />Executive 1 &quot;How do we jump on the indie film train, make all the kids
believe it's about the lack of freedom for normal human beings in society,
put a twist in so they have to go and see it two or three times so they
can
feel cleverer, make them feel more free, but in fact subjugate them even
more?&quot;<br /><br />Executive 2 &quot;Fight club&quot;<br /><br />Fight club could have been good if Pitt's identity had been explained in
the
beginning, rather than the end. Why? Because Norton could have faced the
real issues here. Lack of freedom for expression because you're not good
looking enough, or not confident enough. A whole fascinating dialogue
between Norton and Pitt could have been explored. But no, this film does
the
opposite because it actually manipulates us, and ties us down even more.
This film is what it attacks.
