There is nothing done badly in this movie. Oustanding cinematography
and superior acting only complement a well crafted script and editing.
The most compelling reason to see this, despite what critics may say,
is the script's deep reaching commentary on modern society. The way
that the run of everyday, 9-5 work, consumer based life slowly erodes
dreams and passion, the anger that stirs beneath that, and becomes rage
in some people is precisely exemplified by this story. Full of twists
and turns, the plot doesn't stand alone, but really revolves around the
theme of consumer anger. All the while being a hopeful piece, I think
this movie really shines a light into a standard area of denial in
society. Namely; that &quot;the stuff you own, ends up owning you&quot;. Like all
good debate though, the script presents both sides of the issue, and by
the time the movie ends, you believe in love again, but you can also
understand why some of the wackos snap on occasion, and lash out at
just about anyone they can find. It is tough to write about the source
of frustration that causes some people to go postal, but Fight Club
delivers that in a compelling, can't help but look at the traffic
accident kind of way.<br /><br />That's not to say the film is just a theme piece though. I loved the
edgy, gritty shots and interesting angles that the director uses for
effect. The overall dark, dirty and rainy feel to the pic is
reminiscent of the Ridley Scott movies, Blade Runner, and maybe Black
Rain. Fincher clearly has perfected his craft since Se7en, as good as
that movie was.<br /><br />I usually guess the ending in almost all movies, this one is one of the
rare ones that had me going through the journey along with the
characters.
