If you haven't seen this movie yet, shame on you. If you have seen this
movie, and you liked it, get it on DVD, it's definitely worth it. If you
don't have a DVD player, get one!<br /><br />This is absolutely on my top 5 list of favorite movies of all time. It's a
very well done movie that makes some good comments on the difference between
being human and being what the corporate world tells us we should be. But I
hesitate to say that's the concrete theme of the movie. This movie is just
as much psychological as it is socio-political. It reached me on a very
personal level, because it deals with feelings of dread and inadequacy,
what's done to counter those feelings, and what's going overboard in making
self-transformation. The film suggests that in trying to make positive
changes for ourselves, we often get rid of the good along with the bad. And
that in the subcultures created in a reaction to mainstream society, the
people belonging to those subcultures can be often more elitist than the
people they criticize. The movie has a great duality.<br /><br />The great thing about the movie is that it raises a lot of questions and
makes a lot of points without presenting itself as a doctrine. And for that
reason, it's a movie that can be watched over and over again.<br /><br />
