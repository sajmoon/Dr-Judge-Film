I saw this first when it premiered on TV, having a) been too young to see
it
when it came out in cinema and b) reluctant to sneak my way into a film
that
was what I thought 'pure mindless violence.'<br /><br />Don't let the title fool you. This is never mindless violence.<br /><br />This film is smart, slick and keeps you on your toes from start to
finish.<br /><br />Edward Norton is perfect as the Narrator commonly referred to as Jack.
Brad
Pitt is also excellent as Tyler Durden.<br /><br />This film is incredibly mentally demanding and will leave your head
spinning.<br /><br />At the end after a genius twist, you will either be left dazed or
confused,
or suddenly enlightened as a  light bulb switches on in your
head.<br /><br />If you have not watched the film before, my tip is pay attention to
Nortons
narration. Not only are there some unforgettable lines, it also helps make
sense of the ending. Norton delivers his narration with perfection, he IS
Jack.<br /><br />The violence that originally put me off was indeed sometimes graphic and
many times did I cringe, but the difference with this film is that I could
never take my eyes from the screen. And believe me, if I could stand the
violence, anyone can. (I am the biggest wimp, I still can't sit through
Jurassic Park ;) )<br /><br />I would recommend this film to anyone except my mother, this is a film
that
will literally leave you speechless.<br /><br />Besides, what other film has a line such as 'I am Jacks' diseased
colon'????? Pure genius in cinematic form.
