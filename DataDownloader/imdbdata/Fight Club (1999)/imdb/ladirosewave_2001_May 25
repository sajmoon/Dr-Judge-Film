To begin with yes I'm a chick and yes I loved this movie. Fight Club got a
rep as being a &quot;guy&quot; movie but it's not this movie is for anyone who's ever
felt lost. It speaks to a generation that, as Tyler Durden says has no great
war or great depression, that rings true no matter what sex you are religion
or creed.  For anyone whoever thought, &quot;is there anyone else out there
feeling the same anger and pain that I am at this exact moment?&quot; then by all
means watch this movie.  It will answer with a resounding YES!, then watch
the movie about 10 more times to get the full effect. Finally there is not
enough room for the praise that Ed Norton, Brad Pitt, David Fincher and
company deserve so I'll finish by saying only that if you loved the movie by
all means BUY the dvd, and also read the book; it too is
excellent.
