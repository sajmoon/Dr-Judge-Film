Hey, just curious if anyone has read any of Mr. Palahniuk's other works
such as Survivor or Choke. I know that I've read that some of you have
but I'm interested to hear what you guys think I should hit next. I am
a huge Fight Club fan. The movie really opened my eyes and the book
changed my life. If the rest of his work can expand on this even more I
would be in heaven. Like I said, I've seen Choke, Invisible Monsters,
Survivor, and Lullaby on the library shelves and want to know which one
I should be reading next. I've read a post on here that said that Choke
was pretty vulgar, which is not a problem with me at all, but more
information as to the story lines themselves would be great. If anyone
has read, or even heard anything about these novels, please, I would
love to hear what you have to say. Thanks!
