Words like over-rated and pseudo-intellectual come to mind when I look back
on this film. Its overblown philosophising was lost on me long before it
ended and I was not in the least surprised that its highest popularity in
the IMDB ratings comes from males aged under 18. This demographic is of
course renowned for its ability to look deeply into and appreciate the
philosophical content of movies. 
This film seems to have developed a cult following but not, I suspect, for
reasons its director intended.
