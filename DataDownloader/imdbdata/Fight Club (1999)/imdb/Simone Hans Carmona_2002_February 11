Fight Club is one of the smartest and boldest movies I've ever seen. With a
piercing and deep plot, it achieves greatness in all of its aspects.<br /><br />Edward Norton portrayed with perfection the weak, underestimated man who
searches for help in his little, meaningless life. He finds out that beating
up men might be the best escape from his regular, hollow reality, and the
&quot;evolution&quot; of his character is just terrific.
Brad Pitt shows once more that he's one of the best actors of his
generation. Bitter, laconic, tough, strong. That's what his character is,
and Brad plays his role according to it, never dropping the
ball.
Helena Bonham-Carter is brilliant as the lonely, weak woman who finds in
Brad Pitt's character all the courage she doesn't possess.<br /><br />Add to this a couple of special effects and some of the most brutal and real
fight scenes you'll ever see and you'll get a great movie, one of the most
mind-boggling thrillers ever made.
