I have been told repeatedly to watch this film by several people, and<br /><br />finally got around to it this last weekend. One word- AMAZING. I had the<br /><br />luxury of watching it in a home theater system with a very good<br /><br />surround sound setup, but I can tell it will still be incredible in any<br /><br />environment because of the absolute depth of the acting and story. I<br /><br />believe that there have been several good overviews of the story, so<br /><br />will not delve into that, I will merely state that after watching it twice,
I'm 
desparate to own the DVD, and I don't even have a player yet! Watch<br /><br />this movie!
