My summary really says it all. This is one of the best films I have seen
in
the last 6 months. A mate threw me into it. I truly believe, as all good
films, that I would never have bothered to watch this.
My God, thanks for friends, I love it.
What Can I tell you, not too much of course. Apart from, it really is not
what you think it is. The title leads you to believe that it is a Rocky
movie but more violent. Sadly so does the trailer.
Believe me when I say that, it is nothing like this at all. In fact the
fighting thing, sort of takes a back seat.
Like all good films it has a hint of black humour, and a terrific punch
near
the end. I defy anyone to say that they knew the outcome.<br /><br />If You're good at this sort of thing, try not to predict something that is
just a revelation when revealed.<br /><br />Please let me know if you like this film. This film has reached into my
top
ten and ripped out positions 4 &amp; 5.<br /><br />
