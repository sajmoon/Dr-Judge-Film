Did anyone else pickup on the subversive feminism of the film? At first
glance the film has this stereotypical action role: the guys are going
around beating each other up and creating havoc. However Edward Norton's
character feels unfulfilled until he starts fight club. The world in which
he is living does not require typically male skills of aggression,the
ability to take pain and general war-making. The world can quite easily
carry on without men because what other attributes do men have, that the
world requires that women cant provide? He realises his self worth as a man
by creating a scenario in which his unique skills are valuable and have
meaning. This film is about man's search for his role in the modern world.<br /><br />Oh well, time to watch it again.
