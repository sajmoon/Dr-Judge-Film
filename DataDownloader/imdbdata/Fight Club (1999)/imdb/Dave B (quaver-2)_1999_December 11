1999_December 11 

I didn't want to see this as I am not interested in fighting, but was
dragged kicking and screaming by my girlfriend...Wow what a film, it was so
clever and so entertaining...I couldn't beleive it, why? aren't ALL Films
like this......?Surely Mr Norton must be up for some sort of award for his
role in this.....?and Brad was cool as well...makes a change, well
done...less of the the hollywood big budget films please...more of this
please and the like Coen Brothers you know what I mean...Dave
