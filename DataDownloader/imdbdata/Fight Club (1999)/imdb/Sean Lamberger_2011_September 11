What started out as one of my four or five favorite films has only
grown better over time. Terribly marketed in its theatrical run as a
knuckle-dragging modern rendition of Bloodsport, it&#x27;s sharper, wittier
and ballsier than almost any major studio film of the last two decades.
It&#x27;s a rapidly escalating thrill ride that never hesitates to crank the
dial a bit further, and the progression from droll normalcy to vulgar
aggression to unsettling calm in the face of a genuine revolution is
stunning. On top of all that, the film&#x27;s wit is off the charts, still
intelligent and amusing after almost two dozen viewings. Its cast of
characters is wildly varied, and its smirk- smeared musings on the
nature of modern masculinity remain timely even today. I actually get
shivers every time I revisit particular scenes, with the biggest one
coming - reliably - just moments before the credits roll when that
Pixies tune kicks in and the city skyline takes a new shape. That&#x27;s
what I call an impressive parting shot. A smart, funny, thrilling,
unpredictable modern classic that never takes the easy road. I can&#x27;t
imagine I&#x27;ll ever grow tired of it.
