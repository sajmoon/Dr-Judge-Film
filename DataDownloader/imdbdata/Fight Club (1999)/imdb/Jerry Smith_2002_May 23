Brad Pitt is great as Tyler Durden in this wonderful movie.  Edward Norton
is also very cool and I enjoyed the fight...with himself.  he should have
won best fight for MTV video movie awards.  The directing was on top of it
all and the acting is just perfect.  I also enjoyed Helena Bonham Carter.  I
have never seen Brad Pitt like this and I think it is good to see him act
like this.  He acted very well.  Same with Edward Norton who just got out of
his nazi American History X fame.<br /><br />Overall the movie was very cool and just possibly the best movie of 1999. 
The acting and directing were just awesome.  rating 10 out of
10.
