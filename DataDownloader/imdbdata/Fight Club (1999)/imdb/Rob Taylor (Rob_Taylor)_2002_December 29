A pretty good movie on the whole, and one of the increasing crop which
actually make you think about what's going on a little. There's plenty of
violence and action, but that is just the shallow surface of this film.
There's a lot more going on under the surface than is apparent.<br /><br />Others have already summarized the plot quite well, so I'll just say it's a
worthwhile movie to watch and it's particularly nice to see Meat Loaf in a
film again, albeit with big tits!<br /><br />
