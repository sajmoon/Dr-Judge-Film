Fight Club is the next in what will undoubtedly be a long line of
successes
for David Fincher. The movie, in my opinion, is the definitive work on
males
in today's society. The film - in its own masterful way - chronicles the
gradual immasculization of man as he evolved from the hunter gatherers
that
we once were, relying on instinct and cunning to survive to the tie
wearing,
office working drones that we have quickly become and in the process
losing
the instinct that made man - an animal - what he was.<br /><br />It is in these 'fight clubs' that man finds his true self again and gains
strength from others. The setting for the film is the michrochasm 'sin
city'
that we saw in Fincher's masterpiece, Seven and his use of dark colors,
shadow and clever splicing - look for split second shots of Tyler Durden
in
different scenes in the first twenty minutes of the movie - to make the
story come alive.<br /><br />This movie will be greatly enjoyed by anyone that has ever wondered what
it
would be like to just let go.
