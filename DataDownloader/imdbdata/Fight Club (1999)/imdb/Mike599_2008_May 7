On the outside to someone who has not seen it, Fight club appears to be
a simple violence driven movie about two guys and a girl. <br /><br />However Fight Club is so much more, about half way though it shows
itself as a physcological thriller. When its all don&#39;t be surprised if
you want to restart the movie to fully understand it all, it is one of
the best movies I have seen in a long time. The acting is perfect, each
character is full of depth and the narration is very witty. The fight
scenes are believable and the last half of the film is excellent.<br /><br />My only complaint is the ending of the movie, after a great narrative
the story doesn&#39;t quite know how to wrap it all up.<br /><br />Nine out of ten stars.
