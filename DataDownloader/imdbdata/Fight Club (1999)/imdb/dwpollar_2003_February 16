2003_February 16 

1st watched 2/16/2003 - 8 out of 10(Dir-David Fincher):
Off-the-wall strange production that is basically about a
middle-of-the-road
man trying to change things in his life and the world around him by
becoming
his ultra-ego.  Yes, it is about a fight club and it does have Brad Pitt
in
it and this is basically all we're told about this movie by the sales
people.  This movie is so much more than that!  It is definetly one that
needs to be seen again to get a full understanding of what's going on.
It
seems simple enough in the beginning, kind of.  The middle-of-the-road
guy
meets an off-the-wall free spirit in Brad Pitt and then becomes further
and
further involved in his life.  They start a club together to basically
get
out our frustrations from daily life by pummeling our fellow man and then
living to go another round.  The association becomes more and more
complex
and increasingly more specifically focused on corporate america until a
wild
finale with the two men, who are really one man, duking it out on each
other
to the very end until one side wins over the other.  The romantic
interest,
played by Helena Bonham Carter is kind of just thrown into the middle of
this whole mess but sticks with the one man until the very end.  If I've
confused you, I'm sorry.  See the movie and you'll know why I'm
confused!!
But it's a good kind of confusion that I like to see in films of unique
quality like this one and the more publicized Memento.  It's amazing that
this was distributed by one of the big boys(20th Century Fox) despite
it's
uniqueness.  I guess, Brad P. threw some of his money in on this
one.
