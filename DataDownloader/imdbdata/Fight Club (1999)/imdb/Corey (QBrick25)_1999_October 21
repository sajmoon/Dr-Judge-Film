I came out of this movie totally fried. It was exciting. It was funny. It
had witty dialogue, and an amazing performance from Edward Norton. And it
had a message. The best kind of movies are the kind when you get home,
you're still thinking about them. Lost Highway was one, and so was Eyes Wide
Shut. Fight Club fits in this category.<br /><br />Someone said in an article that Fight Club shows us exactly what's wrong
with Hollywood. I know she didn't mean it this way, but she is absolutely
correct. This is now Hollywood movie. It is mainstream, but it depends on
non mainstream techniques. It dares to be original, it dares to be non
formulatic. It dares to be different. So, in my opinion it does show us
what's wrong with Hollywood, it shows us that there is a lack of originality
out there, and we need more intelligent, witty, films like this!
