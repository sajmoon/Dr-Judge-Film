This is truly one of the greatest movies ever made.  An intelligent film
with action and intrigue and two very, very good looking leading men.  An
excellent plot for thinkers, vivid fight scenes for those who like their
films action packed and if you don't see it for anything else, see it for
Brad and Edward!
See it and be amazed - 10/10
