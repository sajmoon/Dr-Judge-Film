Fight Club is one of the best movies of all time. I have seen it well over
a
dozen times.  This movie is an intriguing look at the mind of a button-down
consumer who gets fed-up with the material ubsessed world he lives in and
starts FIGHT CLUB with the help of his new found friend.  FIGHT CLUB is a
place where other blue-coller men can express their rage in voilent but
satisfying fist fights with other men.  This movie is a MUST
SEE!
