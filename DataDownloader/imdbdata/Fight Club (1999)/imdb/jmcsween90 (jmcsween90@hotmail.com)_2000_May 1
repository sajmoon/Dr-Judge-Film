It is rare that a film of this nature could be so profoundly philosophical
while at the same providing some first class entertainment. Ed Norton has
never been better as the anonymous corporate lap dog who goes through a
major identity crisis when he meets the enigmatic Brad Pitt. Sort of an
'American Beauty' for twenty and thirty-somethings, 'Fight Club' manages to
deal with the real complexities of being a man in a corporate driven,
consumer saturated mess of a society on the cusp of a new millennium.
Although Fincher's masterful direction tends to go awry in the third act
(which regrettably lessens this films impact), 'Fight Club' is nonetheless
one of the more impressive and intelligent pieces of mainstream
entertainment of the last few years.
