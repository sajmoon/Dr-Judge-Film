Edgy, disturbing, and hard-hitting in places, `Fight Club' is a decent
film
that fails to ultimately live up to its initial promise.  With a devious,
deftly handled opening half-hour, it's actually quite shocking how clumsy
and awkward the later stages of `Fight Club' become.  It's almost as
though
director David Fincher so desperately wants the audience to get the point
of
his film, he's willing to beat the audience of the head with that point -
and by doing so, the message of `Fight Club' gets lost.<br /><br />The film opens with the unnamed Narrator (Edward Norton), a despairing
young
man who's grown depressed over his boring, uneventful life, which seems to
have been ripped straight out of a J. Crew catalog.  To alleviate his
misery, the Narrator begins attending self-help meetings, but not meetings
for depressed people.  Instead, he goes to meetings for cancer survivors,
drug addicts, abuse victims; by watching the misery of others, the
Narrator
starts to feel better about his own life.  It's perverse and macabre, but
it's also handled with wicked brilliance, and this is where `Fight Club'
really shines.<br /><br />Unfortunately, just when the film starts to get good, the Narrator meets
two
people: Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a woman who also attends
self-meetings under false pretenses; and the enigmatic Tyler Durden (Brad
Pitt), a charismatic man who, like the Narrator, also feels the strain and
depression of being forced to live a homogenized life.  Durden's solution
to
this problem is his Fight Club, which is a group of disillusioned men who
strip their lives down to their primitive instincts by beating the crap
out
of each other and doing other random, anarchic things.<br /><br />As Durden, much credit should be heaped upon Brad Pitt who's simply
awesome
in the role; even if the raw concept of `Fight Club' sounds stupid, Pitt,
as
Durden, speaks about his Fight Club with such passionate conviction that
it
at least sounds appealing for a few seconds. Unfortunately, no one ever
seems to question Durden after they've had time to mull over the concept,
and the members of Fight Club remain loyal to a man even after they've
gotten their first taste of beating each other to a pulp.  What was a
clever
movie becomes instead oddly fixated on pointless violence, and that's
where
`Fight Club' starts to lose steam - and some of Durden's later, bigger
plans
just bring the film to a grinding halt.<br /><br />Part of Fincher's message in `Fight Club' is to point out the frustrations
of the characters and the absurdities of their desperate solutions.
However, this message is never clear, and in many ways Fincher instead
seems
to be glorifying the message of violence instead of condemning it.
Fincher's direction is almost too good - it glamorizes violence to the
point
of looking slick and cool, instead of raw and disturbing, as it needs to
be.
Fincher has phenomenal visual style, but it unfortunately seems to be
exactly what `Fight Club' doesn't need.  There's a certain irony to `Fight
Club' - the disenfranchised young men belonging to Durden's Fight Club are
essentially trading one controlled society for another - but the irony is
lost when it is painted with pure adrenaline.<br /><br />Without giving the ending of `Fight Club' away, I'll just say that it's
ineptly handled, and it suffers from the same thing many recent films have
been afflicted with: Keyser Soze Disease. There's a revelation at the end
of
`Fight Club' that's supposed to literally blow the audience away, and
profoundly change the events of the entire film (as the revelation of the
identity of Keyser Soze in `The Usual Suspects' did for that film). In
`Fight Club's case, though, the supposedly shocking ending seems forced,
and doesn't make all the prior events of the film seem all that much
different. It's shock value for the pure sake of shock, not to enhance the
rest of the movie. A number of films since `The Usual Suspects' have
relied
on this shock-ending gimmick . . . but unless there's a good script to
fall
back on, this gimmick usually backfires.  It definitely backfires in
`Fight
Club'.<br /><br />`Fight Club' has a few great moments, and it certainly has the look of a
great film.  Unfortunately, it's not great. It's a slick, muddled film
with
a garbled message.  Honestly, rent Fincher's `The Game' instead of this
film
- it has a similar message, except it's much clearer . . . and much
better.
`Fight Club' is forgettable. Grade: C+
