<br /><br />Fight Club is one of the best movies I have ever seen, this is one of David
Fincher best work and is you haven't seen it you should see
it.<br /><br />PS: If some one is going to tell you the end of the movie stop then it
wrecks
the movie. Fight Club is like the 6th sense if you know the end it is
ruined<br /><br />
