Having never read the novel, I couldn&#39;t tell you what differences it
has from the film. But I can tell you this: David Fincher has done it
again!I didn&#39;t think that he could ever top Se7en, but clearly I was
dead wrong. As far as I&#39;m concerned, this is the best movie to ever hit
the screen. The dialog, the actors, the storyline, it&#39;s just flawless.<br /><br />It&#39;s the story about a man in his late 20&#39;s, (his name never told, but
is often credited as Jack, or simply The Narrator, brilliantly played
by Edward Norton) who lives a totally pointless life. He is a slave
under the new Ikea furniture-trend, and works a typical office job. All
this change when he meets Tyler, (Brad Pitt) an eccentric
soap-maker/seller who believes that the true way to salvation lies in
self-destruction. Together they form Fight Club, where every man can
release themselves in a one-on-one fight. But Tylers plans stretches
beyond Fight Club, into something much bigger, and &quot;Jack&quot; is not sure
he is up for the ride.
