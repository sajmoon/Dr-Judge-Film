Fight Club is the most hilarious, profound p***-take of a film I have ever
seen.  The film relentlessly lampoons the manner in which ordinary men
create alter egos in their minds to fulfill their dreams of transcendence,
while simultaneously pointing up the puerile nature of the teenage Ayn Rand
rhetoric of rebellion.  Finally someone has made a film that points out
that
extreme experiences do not bring some mystic wisdom, that the superficially
rebellious are often the most unoriginal and conformist, and that an
asshole
with big ideas is just an even bigger asshole.<br /><br />The sensational twist, which I will not reveal here, is not the unnecessary
piece of cleverness that some allege.  Instead, all I will say is that it
is
absolutely pivotal to the film's true message.  Moreover, Marsha is *meant*
to be an undercharacterised stereotype - she's exactly the kind of sexually
perverse screw-up that men whose lives lack excitement fantasise of
meeting.<br /><br />
