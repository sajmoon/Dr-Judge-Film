Perhaps a little too long, but Fight Club is just a very well-made,
brilliantly written and superlatively performed film. Essentially a
satirical fable, it tells of an insomniac loser teaming up with a
seditious soap salesman to form a no-holds-barred-fight club as an
outlet for their direction-less aggression. This concept is an
intriguing and original one, and works really well. Then there is the
script, it is absolutely superb, with dialogue that will make you both
laugh and think. Fight Club is very well made, with elaborate
production design, great editing and startling images. David Fincher&#x27;s
direction is brilliantly handled and the performances of Edward Norton
and Brad Pitt are superb. Overall, just a great film, a mesmerising
ride through the 1990s male psyche. 9/10 Bethany Cox
