Superb movie.  original, funny, action packed, Robert Paulsen, what more do
you need?  The special effects are great.  Especially the CGI effects.  All
effects are small, short, almost un-=noticeable, but without them... it
wouldn't be the same.  Brad Pitt - Excellent lunatic once again.  Edward
Norton - have to say the same.  Worth seeing in the theatre (assuming i's
still in rotation).  Or get the DVD.  Missing scenes? Oh
Yeah!
