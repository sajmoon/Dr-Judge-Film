Fight Club is one heart pounding and intense film! I rented this film
along with a couple others last night hoping that this movie was going
to entertain and please me. It sure did! The actors were all great
especially Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden. This is one of Brad Pitt's best
roles to date. The script and the directing was excellent adding also
great dialogue expressing the characters. David Fincher does excellent
in my opinion and this is the first film I have encountered in his
films and I will sure to be paying more attention to all of them. The
twist at the end was awesome and you'll never know when it comes. Very
unpredictable. The film can get fairly confusing at times so I advise
to pay extreme attention to it. Overall, Fight Club is a wonderful and
total kick ass film that will never bore you. For a 139 minute film,
this went by fast for how good it was. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10 **** A+
