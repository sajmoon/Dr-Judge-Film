I'm not a sexist, but I believe the males would enjoy this movie much more
than the ladies. This movie is very graphic with all the fight scenes, and I
love that stuff. Ed Norton is tired of life and soon meets Brad Pitt, a fun
and semi-crazy travaler. After they have a  fun mini brawl, they decide to
create the fight club, the club designed to let men take out all their
aggrestion on one another by brutally beating each other. But Ed Norton's
character begins to realise that things aren't what they seem when a
beautiful girl becomes involved. He doesn't know if it's coincidence, or
deadly after- effects of his recent insomnia.
 This may seem to appear as just another violent beating movie, but it is
oozing with other fun and mysterious twists and turns, so the viewer should
pay huge attention to what's going on. The movie knocked me out, fantastic. 
  9.5/10
