wow, this is really a defining movie. that's kind of a played out
expression, something a self-important critic would say, but i think in
this
case it's true. i haven't read the book, but i can't imagine how insane
that
book is, and i'm sure it's great. this is possibly my favorite movie, and
it's certainly the best movie i've seen (i think there's a difference
between the two). it seems like everything in this movie just worked
perfect, i can't think of any complaints.<br /><br />there are just so many strange things that make this movie great. i really
liked the narrator's insight on what was going on. he sounds so
emotionless
and cold, i really think that added a great atmosphere to this movie. the
director is really gifted in order to make a movie with such a difficult
premise so good. the fight scenes were so real, it was really disturbing,
especially when edward norton went nuts on that pretty blonde kid and
f***ed
up his face. i also really enjoyed some of the lines in this movie, most
of
the lines actually.<br /><br />and than there's the ending. the greatest ending ever. i won't spill it,
as
the ending was ruined for me right before i saw it (i was p***ed but in
the
end it took nothing away from the movie), but it is just incredible. i
can't
say enough good about this movie, it's the perfect definition for a great
movie (another brainless critic saying, but it's true). 10/10
