Germans normally have a sensitivity for fascism because they fell for Hitler
some time ago. Today most of them notice, when things go into that direction
and counteract.
Americans can't handle fascism because they never lived it. They fall for
charismatic people all the time.
Remember &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;? As opposed to the Europeans, the American
audience took this whole thing seriously - but ST was meant to mock fascist
propaganda flicks.
&quot;Fight Club&quot; is far more sublime. Tyler Durden installs fascist mechanisms
like &quot;We don't have names&quot;. All the &quot;fighters&quot; fall for Tyler and his
charisma. They establish a &quot;F&uuml;hrerkult&quot;. Individuals don't exist. Remember
the &quot;brain wash&quot; scene.
Many dialogues contain quotes from &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; or sentences similar to
that. You fall for fascism and you don't notice. You feel great. That's the
dangerous thing.<br /><br />Of course, the film has many more aspects. But fighting is not the point of
the movie, nor is it the split personality. They only means of
expression.<br /><br />Watch again and THINK. And compare with sentences of Hitler and politicians
today. It's always dangerous to follow someone blindly - Fight Club shows
what happens.<br /><br />10 out of 10 (a masterpiece)
