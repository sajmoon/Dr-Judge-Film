I've had the DVD lying around for years, and am I sorry I didn't watch
it earlier!<br /><br />What a movie! Some exciting camera work early on, excellent direction,
solid acting. Norton is superb, as is Pitt. Helena Bonham-Carter
delivers a realistic performance - she has come a long way since &quot;A
room with a view&quot;.<br /><br />The story is intriguing and draws one in from the beginning, with never
a dull moment. Scripting is competent and never seems contrived.<br /><br />The photography has several surprising and original moments that help
to reinforce the dislocation of the central character's mental state.<br /><br />But while it's a brilliant watch, it's not perfect: The most glaring
deficiency is the ending. Do yourself a favour and stop watching about
2 minutes before the end. It's lame, a serious let-down. Typically
Hollywood and really goes against the grain of the entire movie.<br /><br />There are more than a few inconsistencies in the story - which become
highlighted when the &quot;twist&quot; is revealed. Far from answering questions,
the plot surprise raises them - you'll see for yourself, they are
obvious.<br /><br />Also disappointing is the fact that after the fights, the bruises and
scars seem to disappear quickly - one day he's black and blue, the next
day he's completely unmarked. I recently had a black eye and it took
weeks to clear. You'd also expect a few broken bones and some serious
dental problems from the continual blows delivered to the mandibles.
Not to mention the concussion effects from repeated head injuries.<br /><br />These quibbles aside, WATCH THIS MOVIE!
