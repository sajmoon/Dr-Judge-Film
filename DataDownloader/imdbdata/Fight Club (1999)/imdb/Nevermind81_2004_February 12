One of my favourite movies, a very dark and funny movie the entire move is
one giant downward spiral. The plot isn't save the themes are fighting,
anarchy, vandalism, the rejection of material possession, building bombs,
blowing things up.<br /><br />I'm wondering if it would be possible to make a movie like Fight Club in
the
current America under the permanent terrorism angst madness.<br /><br />There's a Tyler Durden in every human being.<br /><br />
