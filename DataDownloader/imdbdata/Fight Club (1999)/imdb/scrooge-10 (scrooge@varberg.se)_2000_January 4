2000_January 4 

What can I say, except that this film really surprised me. I began
watching
this movie with a couple of friends,
not knowing what to expect, but was pretty sure it would be worth the time
watching it, consider all excitement from the media.
This film is almost perfect. Edward Norton did a great job acting a man
with emotionally problems as well as mental aberration.
The narrative is brilliant, it&acute;s actually based on a novel by Chuck
Palahniuk, credits to him.<br /><br />The violence was there, showing us some extremly drawnouted fighting
scenes.
Like it, or dislike it.
Personally I think it was just enough disgusting for my
liking.
Half way in this movie something exhaustive happens. It really knocked me
down. You have to see it, otherwise you will remain unknowing:)
Now afterwards it was definitely worth the time. I really enjoyed
it. All assumptions speaks for a pleasant 2 hours.
