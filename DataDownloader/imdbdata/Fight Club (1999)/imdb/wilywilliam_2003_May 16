This is a very stylish movie. From the pounding intro, through the
schizophrenic middle, to the mind warping end, this film engages the viewer
in a totally unique way. The casting is absolutely perfect: Norton's deadpan
narration is great; Pitt is just so cool; and Bonham-Carter is very sexy
(but in a rough kind of way). Even if you don't pick up on the quite heavy
political undertones, this movie can still provide you with enough
entertainment to last the day.
