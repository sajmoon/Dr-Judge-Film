This clever and artistic assault on your senses is arguably David
Fincher's
best work yet.  It is surely not about mindless violence as most viewers
would lead you to think, but the best of what I will call a sub-genre of
'male angst' like the likes of American Beauty and Scorcese's Bringing Out
The Dead.  The acting is spot on, thanks to the magnificent Edward Norton
together with Brad Pitt.  The camera techniques, frame for frame are very
cleverly put together and the excellent cinematography give great depths
to
the characters struggle and confusion.  David Fincher, known for his moody
and disheartening films has created a true and clever social commentary on
how far our so-called 'modern day' living can take us.  Great work!
