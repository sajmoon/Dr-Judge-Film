Nothing will ever compare to the works of &quot;Fight Club&quot;. From the
one-line quotables to the philosophy, pure sublime. Even the filler
could work as a movie itself. Then there are the in-depth, layered
aspects of the film, not to mention a supportive, outstanding score
from &quot;The Dust Brothers&quot;. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton give the best
performances of their careers, scoffed by the Academy for obvious
reasons. Chuck Palahniuk even agreed that the film was an above and
beyond adaptation of his novel. The cinematography is dead on,
enhancing the essence of this film. Anyone who says they do not like
this film simply does not understand what it is. But there is nothing
wrong with it, because those who do understand will love this film.
This movie is flawless.
