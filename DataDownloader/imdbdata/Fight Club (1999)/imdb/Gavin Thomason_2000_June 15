From the moment I heard about this film I wanted to see it although not
really knowing what to expect. Even before I watched Fight Club I raved to
people how good it was because I knew it would be brilliant and it didn't
let me down.<br /><br />I don't think that this film will be appreciated as much as it should be at
first but Fight Club is surely destined to be one of the great
classics.
