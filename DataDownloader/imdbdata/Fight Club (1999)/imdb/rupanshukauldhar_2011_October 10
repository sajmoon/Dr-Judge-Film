The movie attracted me with its very unique title; but i didn&#x27;t found
so much about fight club in the movie. Despite this big fact , i liked
the movie and it seemed to me as one the greatest of all time. the
starts with high speed, so when you are watching you may feel little
uncomfortable. Great acting by pitt and norton. As per as direction
comes you shouldn&#x27;t ask because from my point of view fincher is one
the greatest director Hollywood had. The film is filled scenes which
you will keep on guessing till the climax. this is definitely one of
fincher&#x27;s flick. This film is not for action movie lovers. I will go
4.5/5 for fincher&#x27;s fight club. Go for it because its a great movie not
because you may action sequences as movie doesn&#x27;t have that too many .
