If there was any film made in the 90's that will go on to cult
status
it will be &quot;Fight Club&quot;. Though it recieved mixed reviews and didn't
really
do anything special at the box office, every single one of my friends
agree
it is one of their favorites of all time. I think everyone at my school
loves the movie.<br /><br />For me, violence is not a big deal. I am the first one to admit I am
decensatized to violence, so this film really wasn't at all a big deal in
terms of violence. People would complain that it made it seem cool to go
out
and beat the s--t out of your friends because it will &quot;set you free&quot;. Me
and
my friends get in fist fights all the time, we enjoy kicking the crap out
of
each other. To me, when the fight is over, I feel great. Call me sick if
you
want, but I feel relieved after a fight.<br /><br />One thing that took this film up a notch was the acting. Of course
there is Edward Norton, who I have yet to see in a bad film doing a bad
job
with the role. But for me, Brad Pitt takes the gold. Pitt has always been
one of my favorite actors. I think one reason I like him so much is
because
he is called a &quot;pretty boy&quot;, but he has never really done a &quot;pretty boy&quot;
role. He can actually act. His portrayal of Tyler Durdan is so amazing, he
deserved more recognition than he got.<br /><br />For a film that is called &quot;Fight Club&quot;, they don't really spend a
great deal of time invested in the clubs. I think most of the film focused
more on Edward Nortan's insomnia, and then focused on &quot;Project Mayhem&quot;.
But
believe me, &quot;Fight Club&quot; is a better title.<br /><br />David Fincher is a director that really has a huge future ahead of
him. His direction is so detailed and organized it's scary. On the DVD
commentary with Brad Pitt, Ed Nortan, and Helena Bonham Carter, Fincher
says
of this one scene with Ed and Helena walking down the sidewalk for 30
seconds, &quot;Yeah, I think we did this shot about 27 times&quot;. He is very picky
and wants perfection (much like the late-great Kubric).<br /><br />I'll admit that I was confused a little at the end. But once you
figure it out, the second viewing is so much better. Roger Ebert calls it
&quot;the Keysor Soze Syndrom&quot; to add a suprise ending that changes everything
about the entire film. I'm happy it went with a ending like this. Several
reasons are one, it keeps it interesting, two, it makes the film even more
unique than it already is, and three, how else would you end it(?).
Seriously, I don't think I would have loved it as much with a different
ending.<br /><br />Overall, this will be the leading cult film of the 90's. Just look
at
how &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; is today, classic. 10/10
