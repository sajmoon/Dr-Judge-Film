I've seen this movie over 50 times as of the writing of this review. Seems
like I enjoy each new viewing more than the last. The attention to detail
in
this movie is incredible. Every scene seems as if its been worked and
reworked until its just right. The script is enthralling and actually
makes
you resent most of the movies you've seen in your life for their sheer
mediocrity.<br /><br />I whole heartedly recommend buying the DVD since the extra commentary
really
does give the viewer a special insight into the story and the
characters.<br /><br />10/10
