1999_October 24 

But not a spectacular film.  This is another &quot;question reality&quot; film.  More
than anything, I liked the fact that this film was directed by David
Fincher, who directed the extraordinary &quot;Express Yourself&quot; video.  On that
note, the look of this film reminded me of that video.  Visually, it's a
dazzling film; the cinematography is striking and almost spellbinding, plus
the editing is terrific.  There's A LOT of blood/gore in the film, but that
should be expected in a film with a title like &quot;Fight Club&quot;(hint, hint: not
for the squeamish).  This film also has many amusing moments--I laughed
throughout most of the movie.  However, contrary to what some reviewers have
said, these are NOT the best performances of the two male leads.  I enjoyed
Edward Norton's performance, but it cannot even come close in comparison to
his tour de force performance in &quot;American History X&quot;.  Although I can't
stand Brad Pitt, he acted well in this film, playing yet another unusual
character.....but this performance cannot top his performance in &quot;Twelve
Monkeys&quot;.  Furthermore, the enormous talent of Helena Bonham Carter, the
darling of period films, was wasted in this film.....it wouldn't have made a
difference if she had not been in this film.  In fact, the whole presence of
her character got annoying after a while.  The most enjoyable performance
was that of Meatloaf, playing the character named Bob--it was one of the
most amusing things about the film.  What I disliked the most about this
film was that it was too long.....and the ending was disappointing.  And,
the film got confusing after about the first hour or so.  Nonetheless, it
was one of the better films of 1999, this terrible year for
films.
