Saw it, loved it.<br /><br />Norton is something else. Fight Club had a lot to say, and did so in an
interesting manner. The movie really explored what it is to be a man in
this
pre-millennial era. Never occurred to me that it was nearly 3 hours
long.<br /><br />Project Mayhem showed that men are desperate to follow anyone who is a
strong leader, even if the ideals espoused by that leader are totally
wacko.
In a time when lots of men are chained to their desks at mid-level boring
jobs; where women seem to want a sensitive, intelligent, bad-boy, psycho
biker; the film did a great job of highlighting the contradictory messages
about power, strength, machismo, and the male self image.<br /><br />The movie was not perfect, however. Bonham-Carter's performance was great
(and hopefully will help dispel her Merchant-Ivory image), but her
character
was not used to its full potential. Meat Loaf was fantastic as &quot;bitch-tit&quot;
Bob -- just the right mixture of humor and sensitivity. The movie did lose
a
little in its pace during the height of the Project Mayhem
weirdness.<br /><br />However, I will not soon forget Norton's final confrontation with his
auto-exec boss. That scene was priceless. I highly recommend Fight
Club.
