1999_November 26 

Real moviemagic is FIGHT CLUB. This must be the best movie
of
1999.  This is a smashing comedy with a story you don't
have
to try to tell. Norton is simply superb, Pitt is in his best
role ever and the surprising &quot;small part&quot; from Mr. Meat
Loaf
is absolutely Oscar worthy.
Pitt and Norton both should receive one ! Fincher will
have
difficulty topping this... But Hey, if you can top Se7en...
Woooowww.  Great rollercoaster ride.
Thanks
