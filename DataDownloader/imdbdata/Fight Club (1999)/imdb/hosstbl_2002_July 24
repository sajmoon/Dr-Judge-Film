Much has been made about the infamous twist to the film which you may or
may
not see coming (personally, I did see it coming).  I absolutely loved the
first 1hr 50 mins of the film up to the point at which the twist is
revealed.  The problem is that once the twist is revealed, you are left
with
an utterly tedious 25 minutes for the rest of the film to play
out.<br /><br />Someone should have explained to David Fincher that once you reveal the
clever twist of your movie, the film is pretty much over and at most the
audience can tolerate perhaps an additional 5 minutes of tying up loose
ends.  Instead, this film gets lost in nearly a half hour of wretched
storytelling that completely destroys the momentum which it had built
up.<br /><br />9/10 for the first 110 minutes.  2/10 for the closing 25 (excluding the
credits).  Overall, I'd give it 7/10 and will probably eventually purchase
it on DVD.
