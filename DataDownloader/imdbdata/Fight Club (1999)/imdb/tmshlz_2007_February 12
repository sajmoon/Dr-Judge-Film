When watching a movie what sets it apart from other films? is it its
style, its story, characters, moral or message?I like style, but when
the rest sucks, it feels like a designer cupboard with no space to put
something in, and you&#39;re left with something nice to look at but with
no use... Well fight club is A DESIGNER CUPBOARD with plenty to put in.<br /><br />First of all the visuals are stunning and top notch all of them.Colours
are balanced the editing is clever and well placed, wardrobe and
settings all urban,beautifully realistic without glamorizing its
emptiness or its decay. This is what &quot;we&quot; live in, everyday.<br /><br />Then there&#39;s the story and its messages and morals...frustration,
boredom, emptiness and the feeling of being the 2nd born in
history...no direction to go, but to go ahead in a society that takes
all but doesn&#39;t leave but the option of being a customer, a lifestyle
obsessed doing jobs we hate copping things we don&#39;t need.<br /><br />Break out, start a revolution, don&#39;t give a damn, and become... Tyler
Durden. Smart, witty, good looking and willing to sacrifice anything
for point zero. Don&#39;t hold on, let go...what makes you ain&#39;t got no use
at all. Don&#39;t solve nothing...for what anyway? Learn society and learn
how to trick it, learn how to live without it, give up all be free and
survive on its edge. Start a fight, get punched and get to know you, go
on shave your head, bomb a building, sacrifice status and lifestyle
become a brain dead space monkey and find out you&#39;ve been punk ed again
this time by Tyler and his world view.<br /><br />Like Brett Easton Ellis wrote: &quot;No Exit&quot; for none of us.
