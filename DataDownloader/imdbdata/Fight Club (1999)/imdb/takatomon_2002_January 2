of course this film is hypocritical, so are you and so am i! it's the
american way. it uses high price sfx and production values while ragging on
consumerism. that's the point! you are cornelius... you spent your $8 on the
movie ticket or $30 on the dvd... you are the consumer! you got what you
wanted... are you happy now? if it was a poorly made movie... nobody would
see it and it's &quot;fake&quot; message would never be heard. it gives america
exactly what it wants... great sfx, down and dirty sex... and graphic
realistic violence. (as opposed to action adventure violence where the hero
or anti-hero never gets a scratch and the bad guys can't shoot the broad
side of a barn) to me... the message of the movie is that if you really like
it... then perhaps you are part of the problem. i bought the dvd and now i
can't quit sneezing... hmm.
