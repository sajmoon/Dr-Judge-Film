Natural Born Killers meets the Sixth Sense meets Twelve Monkeys meets
Jacob's Ladder meets Angel Heart meets the Matrix meets Killing Zoe. Need I
say more? If you like any or all of the above films, this one's a no miss.
Don't be turned off by what was a failed marketing plan that totally missed
the intended audience and completely misrepresented what the film was about.
That's why most of the people who should've seen this film didn't go, but I
believe this will gain cult status on video once word of mouth spreads among
those who the film was truly meant to be seen by in the first
place.
