I like Brad Pitt. I really like Edward Norton. But (without all the
!!!&#39;s) I have to agree with a previous poster: what a waste! This film
tries to wrap something romantic around some pretty pointless
destructive, and self-destructive behaviour. It then tries a cop-out
ending by ... nope, that would be a spoiler, wouldn&#39;t it? It&#39;s
cinematically interesting in places, in the course of exploring &quot;How
low can you go?&quot;. But this film is clearly written with a message: a
subtle advocacy of just going blam random, that makes me grieve.<br /><br />If you&#39;ve given up on anything positive in life, and figure injuring
yourself is less boring, then you may see more in this film than I do.
Any action film will skip past the real likely outcomes of getting
smashed in the head over and over again. This film tries to suggest
there&#39;s a higher principle, while throwing reality out the window ...
and then wets itself because there&#39;s no place to go.
