Did you ever wonder what happened to your imaginary playmate? Maybe he grew
up to be Tyler Durden.  If nihilism is your thing and you feel emotionally
disenfranchised, this is the movie for you.  Mr. Fincher succeeds (love
that
designer soap) and fails (men in black) with the movie he presents.
Creditable performances by Mr. Pitt and Mr. Norton, but Ms. Bonham Carter
had a bad hair day. &quot;American Beauty&quot; has a better punch.
