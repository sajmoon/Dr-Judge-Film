1999_December 24 

Best film of 1999. No other way of describing it. Edward Norton deserves an
oscar. The entire thing is brilliant from start to finish. anyone who
missed
it because f the violence was a fool. Rent it on video and wonder why you
didn't watch it at the cinema. Sheer class from start to
finish.
