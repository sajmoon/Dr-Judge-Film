i remember seeing previews for fight club and thinking that it looked
like a cool movie about guys who fight a lot. i did not see it at
first, but when i did, i was very pleasantly surprised. Not only is
this movie about guys who like to fight, it is the story of a
nameless-insomniac-narrator who finds refuge by going to meetings for
disease stricken people. When Marla Singer ruins that, he meets a man
named tyler durden that changes his life forever. they start an
underground fight club and tyler takes him for the ride of his life,
having the narrator discover who he really is. this movie is a dark
thrill ride that ventures to question many of the staples in today's
society. Based on the first novel by chuck palahniuk (who by the way is
the best writer going, if you haven't yet, read more of his books i.e.
choke and survivor etc.), this movie is easily my favorite ever and is
a piece of art put together by the best minds in the business. i give
David fincher the thumbs up for his excellent adaptation of a classic
novel.
