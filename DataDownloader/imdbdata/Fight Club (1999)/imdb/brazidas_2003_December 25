Once I read a critic that states this movie as &quot;a deep inside view in the
strange universe of fascist groupuscles in America&quot; . No other view could
be
more limitated about this astonishing movie. The detail is: I live in
Brazil
and that critic was a brazilian one. My country is not specially known for
having a deep inside about world and existencial matters, but most of the
time, they follow the limited tendency of analysing what they see for some
ideology, without consider different views about what they are seeing and
saying.<br /><br />I wonder why David Fincher has not much more big hits like this and Seven.
First you got some of psychological immersion, with the double personality
scheme stressed to the most. Second, you got views about the system
against
itself: through characters with little plans about their own destiny and
lifes...through the creeping details of a job, of a house in decay, of the
merchandising abuse. The question before 11/09 was like: What we will do
about ourselves ? Where to go ? And this movie thinks exactly about this.
Third, and beyond the point just wrote : it got male groups ritualistic
discussion. Tribe thing. Somewhat on that remember me the Robert Bly
parties
but much improved. Violence on the movie is just a vehicle to discuss more
important topics, like the role of the male in a society that got no scape
exit. That showed no great chances of heroism. And mainly: no answer to
the
male role anxiety in a world where women became more and more the
&quot;heroins&quot;.<br /><br />More than all that it's a movie that discuss philosophy by showing the
example. The scene where they menace an official is pure Marx...&quot;we feed
you, clean you, take care of you...&quot; and Marcuse &quot; we got jobs we dont
want
to pay for things we don't need&quot; . This is an exciting minimalism . And
all
of this is said resentless. Fincher discuss the system but knows very well
we'll live inside it.<br /><br />The final sequence has 2 main questions. The 1st one is somewhat a
freudian
one and disappointed me. The role of Helen Bonham Carter is like the
answer,
the easy answer to complex matters. It's like saying sex is the solution
to
all the problems discussed. It seems like the producers and big hats
messing
on the final result. Second, the &quot;revolution&quot; made to turn things harder
and
make people think got a final project somewhat ridiculous. I see this as a
strong irony to political groups that like to hyperdimension their roles
in
life.<br /><br />It seems that Al-Qaeda members saw this picture and didn't understand
specially this final point.<br /><br />
