Okay, I saw this film with my friend Eldebo, and some of my comments match
his. If you've already read his comments, I'm sorry for the redundancy,
but
here goes.......<br /><br />At some point in this movie, I realized that I couldn't tell whether or
not
this was a good movie, I couldn't tell whether or not this was bad movie,
all I could tell was that it was f@#!ed up. I saw this movie a few weeks
before my 25th birthday, and I can say that in my (at that time) almost 25
years of life I have never seen a movie which affected me so much, that I
was left utterly numb and my brain barely functioning. I seriously
actually
had to concentrate on such things as walking and talking, my brain was so
numb, I could barely do anything but sit down. And no movie I've seen
since
has so numbed my brain.
I was going through my last semester in college when I saw the film, and I
kept thinking about that when watching this movie, and the possibility
that
it would force me further down the spiral, and if I would have to give up
even more of my sanity. Also, if you are familiar with the game, Mage: The
Ascension, I kept thinking if I was feeling what people feel when they
awaken (I hate to use such an obscure reference, but it's the best one
that
fits).
And probably the most messed up thing is that the movie didn't present me
with anything new, anything I didn't know already, or anything I hadn't
already thought of.
