Probably the most influential film since Pulp Fiction. The film questions
reality, morality, manhood, and how the media influences society to be
like
sheep following one another. More importantly, the film shows us what a
normal life can do to you.<br /><br />This is one of those films that you cant watch the once and catch
everything--- every time you watch it, you learn something new-- and it's
the little things which make you jerk forward, and say &quot;uhhh never saw
that
before-- that's clever!&quot; e.g. the waiters advertised on teh hotel TV in Ed
Norton's room work for him...wont be a cinema pest and spoil the rest
though.<br /><br />The lighting is costantly at a green/lime light-like buzzing hue to make
us
feel in a state of non-being, and the sharp editorial implicates the melow
state of existing before Norton meets Pitt in teh film.<br /><br />It's the film that put Ed Norton in the controversy line, showing evryone
that he's ben in something worthwhile, not mindless hollywood
sheep-garbage.
It was also the second controversial Film Brad Pitt did before Snatch.
Fight
club could well of been a solid landmark, surpassing Pulp Fiction, but
it's
mainly aimed at youths aged 17-34, and doesn't necessarily appeal to
people
in their middle age because of the speed of the direction, etc. Plus the
subject matter only appeals to youths anyhoo.<br /><br />Watch it, then watch it again to see what you missed, then watch it again
to
see what you missd before that time!<br /><br />Cracking---9/10***
