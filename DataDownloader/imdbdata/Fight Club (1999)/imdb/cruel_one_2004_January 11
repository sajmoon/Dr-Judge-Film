Fantastic overall commentary against yuppie-dom and the quest for
material
possessions, but at its core a love story. Incredible performances by
Edward
Norton and Helena Bonham-Carter, and a delightfully psychotic Brad Pitt.
The
movie does tend to run a bit long, but you can easily overlook that.
Director David Fincher paints a provocative picture in a wasteland that
could be any major US city, and stays wonderfully faithful to Chuck
Palahniuk's novel of the same title. This is a movie that is every bit as
good as the book. Top-notch, all the way.
