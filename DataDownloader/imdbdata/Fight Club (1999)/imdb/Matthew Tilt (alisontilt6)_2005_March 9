the movie of the 90s. this film is amazing! the modern Jekyll and Hyde
story. Edward Norton playing the normal, yet miserably boring &quot;good
one&quot;, while brad Pitt is the rebel, the one with a mind of his own, and
the one who offers ed's character a way out. but this film is not a
boring drama just described, the plot twists and turns in between the
brutal (and they are cringeworthingly brutal at times) fights all the
way up to the shocking end. this film is like many of the classics, to
understand fully its meanings and views on our modern society then you
must (MUST!) watch this film a few times, or you will miss so much more
then you think. one more piece of valuable advice: watch...this...film!
