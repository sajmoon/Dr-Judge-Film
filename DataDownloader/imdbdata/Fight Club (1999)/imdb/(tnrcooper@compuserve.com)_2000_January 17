Well, we're not in Kansas anymore Dorothy.  Wow.  That was quite something. 
I have not had this feeling since I saw Pulp Fiction.  That was a powerful
film.  Ed Norton and Brad Pitt both deliver excellent performances and
Meatloaf goes some way to redeeming himself from his poor singing career. 
Heaven knows I'll never think of him quite the same way again.  This movie
was smart, brutal, and very funny too.  I read a whole bunch of comments on
this film coz I was so fascinated by it.  I wanted to see what others said. 
Some mentioned the violence.  I'm inured to that.  I really didn't notice
the violence.  Just watch boxing if you want violence.  I thought the script
was excellent and I had some wonderful laughs at the excellent script. 
Norton and Pitt are second to none.  Pitt really is not just another pretty
face.  Norton's narration was excellent.  His detached anger seeped through
in the delivery.  He was like a time-bomb waiting to happen.  I don't know
that the Academy is brave enough to award him an Oscar nomination.  I doubt
that owing to Messrs. Hanks, Spacey, Carrey, Washington, and maybe Pacino,
but he deserves one nevertheless.  The parody of peoples' dependence on one
another was hysterical.  The fact that his anti-establishment group became
an inane group in itself was very clever.  The attitude of Norton towards
his boss was hysterical.  That one scene in his office where he destroys his
furniture.  Man....I was dreaming.  I don't think that he really would have
gotten away with that but it was fun to watch.  The music was excellent too.
 Altogether a fantastic film and one that you need to see several times in
order to fully appreciate.
