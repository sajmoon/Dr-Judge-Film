Edward Norton plays Jack, an unassuming man with a job that makes him as
normal as they come. Then he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a soap
salesman
that seems to have an attitude towards life that Jack wished he had. Jack
soon begins to see things the way Tyler sees them, and they start &quot;Fight
Club&quot;, a secret club for frustrated men that needs to feel alive through
pain. This alone would indicate that this is a pure action flick. Wrong.
That would be the easy way.
So, what is Fight Club about?
Social criticism, personal values, fear of your own way of life,
disillusion, revolt or frustration?
Amazingly, it's all of the above and then some.
Multi-layered and complex are the words I find to be the most accurate
description. Fight Club branches out mercilessly throughout the entire
movie, flogging and whipping values and morals into an unidentifiable pulp,
with the only goal of re-shaping it into something better.
This is perhaps the best, and most accurate description we have today, of
young people trying to find a place in this world, where being you isn't
enough and values, at best, aren't applied because you want to, but because
you have to. A masterpiece of our time, with a statement larger than life.
But remember, you don't talk about Fight Club, you go and see it.......Now.
