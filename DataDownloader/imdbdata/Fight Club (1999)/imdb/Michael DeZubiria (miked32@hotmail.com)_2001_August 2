Edward Norton returns after his earth quaking performance in American
History X to play the part of Jack (who has no last name for a reason), a
typical white-collar guy who works in an office, makes a good salary, and
spends his time trying to find that perfect furniture set or that set of the
ideal matching dishes. He lives in an empty world defined by possessions and
income &#150; a world that is empty beyond his paycheck and his high rent
apartment. He realizes this on a subconscious level and begins to have
trouble sleeping, so eventually he goes out and joins support groups for
afflictions that he doesn't have, just for the emotional release and the
feeling of belonging and of meaning. He almost immediately finds relief to
his sleeping problems (`Babies don't sleep this good.'), and makes the
support groups a regular activity. <br /><br /> 
Unfortunately, one day he runs into someone else who is doing the same
thing, Marla, and it ruins everything for him. This woman disgusts him (for
obvious reasons), but he ultimately tries to reason with her so that they
can both do the support group thing and not run into each other. The movie
really starts moving when Jack runs into Tyler Durden while on a business
trip. They meet on an airplane, and Jack is immediately impressed at what an
interesting `single-serving' friend Tyler is. Tyler gives Jack his card, and
Jack later calls him after his apartment explodes. Jack goes to stay with
Tyler out of necessity, and Tyler introduces Jack to his world. Jack is
fascinated. <br /><br />Tyler lives in a world devoid of personal possessions and responsibilities.
He lives in a disgusting house, has no job (no steady one, anyway), pays no
bills, and would more than likely be in trouble with the IRS if he were to
be audited. He lives below the poverty line, obviously, but he is free, and
Jack admires his ability to reject all forms of authority. Out of the blue
one day, Tyler asks Jack to hit him, and after some convincing, they get
into the fist fight that sets off the chain reaction which results in the
formation of the tremendously popular Fight Club, Jack's most violent but
most successful support group, a club that grows exponentially despite it's
own first two rules. <br /><br />The goal of Fight Club is to get it's members to analyze their own lives and
eliminate unnecessary garbage (`The advertising world has us working jobs we
hate, so we can buy sh*t we don't need.') and to obtain psychological
freedom through mutually agreed violence between members. Sure, this sounds
a little weird, but there really is something to be said about the
psychological states obtained from pain. To put it in the immortal words of
Beavis &amp; Butt-Head (just after Butt-Head has `smacked Beavis upside the
head') &#150; Butt-Head: `That was cool!' Beavis: `No it wasn't, that sucked!'
Butt-Head: `Yeah but like, after it's over, doesn't it like, feel pretty
cool?' Beavis: `Oh yeah, do that again!' This is not something that is
likely to be practiced by everyday society, but a club like Fight Club would
probably be successful on many levels (one of which, of course, would not be
the legal level). There are a few things in the film that could have done
with a little bit more explaining, like why Jack is so interested in
fighting William Shatner, but it doesn't matter that this is not explained.
Fight Club is one of those movies that not only invites, but also REQUIRES a
second viewing, and for countless reasons.<br /><br />Fight Club asks audiences to re-evaluate their lives, noticing the
superfluous quality of the material obsessions of modern society. It is one
of the most cinematically unique films to be released in years, and easily
earns it's place among the greatest films of 1999 (and possibly of the
entire decade), alongside such other classics as The Matrix, The Sixth
Sense, and American Beauty, although it has much more in common with the
first two. There is an obvious correlation between Fight Club and director
David Fincher's previous classic, Seven, which is another spectacular dark
film from the same director. Fight Club is definitely aimed at a male
audience, and it should actually be commended, in my opinion, for not
sacrificing any quality just to attract a larger female audience, which is
something that is almost universally seen in Jerry Bruckheimer productions
like The Rock and Armageddon and Pearl Harbor. <br /><br />Fight Club does not pretend to be something it's not, and it comes off with
tremendous success. I have heard professional film critics give Fight Club
the lowest rating possible, foolishly focusing on the violent aspect of the
film and entirely missing the point of the film as a whole while at the same
time proving without a doubt that some critics simply cannot be trusted. Be
advised that this is an almost stomach-turningly violent film at some
points, but instead of condemning the film for that, it should be recognized
for fitting that much violence into what is ultimately such a skilled and
memorable film. It's too bad that films of this quality are so rarely seen
in modern cinema.
