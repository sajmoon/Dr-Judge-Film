Now, I had heard nothing but good things about this movie before I saw
it. Luckily, when I rented it, I was not disappointed. The screenplay
was brilliant. Serious dialogue intertwined with witty remarks made for
innumerable great quotes. The great acting of Ed Norton, Brad Pitt, and
Helena Bonham Carter just made the screenplay and the movie itself seem
that much better.<br /><br />The movie obviously faces criticism because the name suggests that
there will be non-stop fighting between guys, obviously appealing to
the people who would like to see a movie just to see guys beat the crap
out of each other. They were probably mad, however, to realize that the
movie had a deeper meaning. Perhaps they just don't understand the
intellectual nature of the movie. I'll spell it out for you right now.<br /><br />The movie delves into the human need/desire for attention and a feeling
of worth in the world. The Narrator doesn't want to be Joe Schmo with
his IKEA house and run-of-the-mill job. So he starts Fight Club &quot;with
Tyler.&quot; It's about some worthless guy trying to less worthless.<br /><br />Also, the movie explains the evils of materialism. I don't care whether
you're rich, poor, old, or young; you can appreciate the message that
the movie gets across. You don't need to have an apartment with every
piece of furniture from a catalog, you just need yourself and what
makes you happy.<br /><br />I don't know about you, but I'd much rather spend 2 hours of my life
watching something that'll give me a less rather than spend 2 hours
watching men punch each other.
