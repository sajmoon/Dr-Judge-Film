If I had to sum this movie up in one word I wouldn't be able to do it.  I
would go on and on about why this may be the greatest, most original, and
most important film of all time.  This movie has something for everyone.
Its got ultraviolence for guys, Brad Pitt for girls, profound messages for
critics, and an amazing plot anyone can appreciate.  If you watch the
previews for this movie whatever you think it will be about is wrong.  The
actual underground boxing ring only exists through about the first half of
the movie.  I wont say what happens after that, because you should see this
movie with as little knowledge of what its about as possible.  The ending
is
probably the biggest surprise in any movie ever.  Even more surprising than
The Sixth Sense.  It is my favorite movie of all time, and it gets better
every time I watch it.  Thats the other thing you should know.  Watch this
movie at least twice. Thats the only way you should see it.  Also, if
you've
read the book,  don't think of it as a translation from book to film, but
as
a film of its own.  Its much better that way.
