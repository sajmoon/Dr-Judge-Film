Perhaps it&#39;s the concept of the movie itself which hold the viewer
throughout. Some of the stunts during fight sequences are particularly
well done...and obviously, the sound is excellent...witness awards.<br /><br />While it seems to grow more and more outlandish, the viewer is
captivated by the very basis of the movie. This is one of those movies
that would never fall in a top ten list, yet it is memorable in the
same vein as &quot;The Usual Suspects.&quot;<br /><br />One can fault Brad Pitt, perhaps, for a bit of overacting. And the
female characters are underdeveloped. But, after all, this is touted as
a &quot;guy&#39;s&quot; movie. Yet, the concept is so unique...I wish I could give it
away. Other mini-summaries had trouble explaining it as well, without
giving away the essence of the movie, which is really NOT about &quot;fight
clubs.&quot;
