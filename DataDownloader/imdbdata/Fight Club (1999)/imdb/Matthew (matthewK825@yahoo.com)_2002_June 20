What can be said that hasn't already been recorded by now?  You
either love this film, or you don't understand it.  And it seems that
the latter is more common than the former.  It is often described
as disturbing, violent, and confusing.  Typical comments from
spoon fed movie goers that would rather see Lucas destroy a
legacy by Disney perportions.  Fight Club makes you think.  If you
don't walk away questioning, yourself, and s**t you've accumulated
to make you feel better about the state your life is in, then you're 
beyond convention help and need to have your ass kick.  Fight
Club is disturbing.  It's one of it's stronger attributes.  Sometimes it
takes something that makes us uncomfortable before we can see
things for how they really are.  The words of Tyler Durdan are only
now coming true; Martha Stuart, f**k Martha Stuart.  Martha Stuart
is shining doorknobs on the Titanic.  Only now do we see how true
that is.
