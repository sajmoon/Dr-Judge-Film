Yes I liked the film but I'm just wondering how Norton gives his alter
ego the same name as him and can successfully convince himself they are
two separate people when they share the same name. i.e. growing up
being called Tyler Durden, being called Tyler at work, etc... how does
the separation of the narrator's character and his name, Tyler D.,
work? Maybe a literate somebody who was confused like me can show me
the light. Thanks, because I am confused.<br /><br />Besides that...because the IMDb guidelines say I have to have 10 lines
of text to make my post legit...who else watched the Norton, Pitt,
Bonham and Fincher commentary? I did. It was jokes, and at the same
time insightful. Anybody share my feelings? Raise your hand.
