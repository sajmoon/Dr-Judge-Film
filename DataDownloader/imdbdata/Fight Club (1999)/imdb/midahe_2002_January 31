This is the most disturbing piece of crap I have ever seen in my life. I
do
not understand why someone would write a motion picture to be as
destructive
and antisocial as this film. The violent, antisocial, psychotic world
portrayed in &quot;Fight Club&quot; is the lowest form of entertainment ever to
crawl
out of the ses [sic] pool of Hollywood.
