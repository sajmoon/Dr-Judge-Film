1999_October 16 

I had read many reviews on this site prior to seeing the movie, Fight Club.
Most people were saying it was violent and bloody or a visually stunning
picture or that it was a work of art in one way or another.
I have to say I can't even believe the way I felt after about an hour's
worth of this film...what trash!  It was all of the world's social ills
wrapped into one totally mixed up and messed up story of little or no use.
I still can't believe the critics and the viewing audience can have
anything
positive to say...I was so disappointed;  it was NOT too violent, it was
NOT
visually stunning (i swear I've read that quite a bit), and it was NOT an
acting achievement.  It was monotonous, intellectually benign, and
basically
a truckload of all that we, in society, have come to be discontent
with...thrown back at us from all the stupid tv, tabloids and talkshows
that
are such a part of our culture.
It's not even like it MATTERS if there was anything in the film &quot;to figure
out&quot;;  there are certainly many interpretations we could analyze with the
film, but honestly, we all get some dose of the film in the course of our
lives as we go through a day on Planet Earth.  The fact that it was done
with such a psychological twist does not make it entertaining.  It's just a
loud statement of everyone's feeling about how screwed up things are and
how
everyone has a need to rise up at some point to scream at the
establishment.<br /><br />I wish I could bring myself to gain a clearer understanding of why some in
the viewing audience felt it was such an amazing experience.  I got the
impression that even the filmmakers glanced at eachother from time to time
and wondered what level of stupidity they should decide to stop at.
