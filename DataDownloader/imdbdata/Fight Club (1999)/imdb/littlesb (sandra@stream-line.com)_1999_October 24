1999_October 24 

Wow!  When I left the theater after seeing this movie I felt like I had just
been punched silly myself!  TOO MUCH fighting in this film...hello, we got
the message after the first few rounds!<br /><br />Very uneven and in some places redundant, still this movie is intriguing and
thought-provoking.  To me, the best part was the very beginning when Edward
Norton is attending the support groups and, in my opinion, a whole film
could have been created out of just that premise.  But suddenly he meets
Tyler and the movie takes a radical turn.<br /><br />This is obviously a film for film-makers, as there are so many
self-indulgent references and enough camera turns to give the average viewer
vertigo.  It is dark and there are so many splattering faces, car wrecks and
falls through glass that after awhile you give up trying to figure out how
these guys could have actually survived such intense punishment. It is
propagandist and delivers its message over and over, pounding OUR heads into
the concrete so that we will see what materialist schmucks we all are if we
work at a normal job and have a condo and furniture.  For all these negative
reasons, I could only give this movie a 6, but I would still say &quot;Go see
it&quot;. It's a reel experience.
