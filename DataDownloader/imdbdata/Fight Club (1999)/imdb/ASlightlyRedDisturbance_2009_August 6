2009_August 6 
I did not know what to expect from Fight Club, but I gave it a try
since I am a fan of Fincher&#x27;s films Se7en, Zodiac, and the more recent
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. This film surprised me in it&#x27;s
style and tone. It has a very inventive narration and surreal images
that only help make us go deeper into Edward Norton&#x27;s character and his
mind. I can safely say there are not too many films like this. The main
premise seems simple, two men create a combat group that soon turn into
a large cult or society. Although it is simple, the film&#x27;s choices and
execution are not simple. I was confused by a lot on this film, and I
am sure this is a film I will have to watch more than once, but I was
deeply invested in these characters. I felt the reason for the main
characters&#x27; choices and the struggle with their lives that they felt
they needed to overcome, and the only way to do that was by fighting,
not for winning or losing, but to feel important and feel more absorbed
in the practice of it all. Very original idea. I thought the writing
was sensational, a lot of very thought-provoking ideas and dialogue in
the film. I did not know what to expect, but the twist actually shocked
me. I have seen a lot of films with twists similar to this, but the
film executed it in a unique way and thought it fitted well. David
Fincher&#x27;s direction seemed more confident and mature here than in any
other of his films. I cannot believe the screenplay writer from this
also wrote Jumper(WOW). The performances here were brilliant. Norton
was great, but the ones who truly shined were Pitt and Carter. I always
feel both these actors, especially Helena, create some truly fantastic
characters, and this is no exception. I did not always think Pitt was a
capable actor, but with films like The Assassination of Jesse James,
Benjamin Button and Burn After Reading from 2008, he has proved he is
great. I am surprised neither Carter or Pitt got many awards or
nominations.<br /><br />I thought Fight Club was fantastic, and in a truly weird sublime way,
it was entertaining. Like I said, there were some tricky parts, but I
thought it was a film that could be a disaster but had so many elements
to it. Probably Fincher&#x27;s best, along with Benjamin Button (I&#x27;ll see
which stands stronger as time goes by). Along with his other film,
Se7en, one of the best of the 90&#x27;s.
