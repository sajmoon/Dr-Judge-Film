When I just began to watch this movie, I asked what the hack are these
guys doing? Because 2 main characters were laughing even though they
were fighting.This movie talks about a man who finds who he is at the
end of movie by finding his ego. The story is this.<br /><br />One day when a man came back to his home, he found his house was
burning. From now on he lost everything; his home, his money and so on.
But he was lucky, because at that time he met with a guy who makes the
soap for living. They became the friends so he( whose home was burned)
could live with a new guy. One day, they went to the club and suddenly
fought. They just felt some good things in fight. So, they had decided
to make the FIGHT CLUB where some guys come and fight with other guys
to share their feelings. But the purpose of making this club was to
make the terrorists. As the groups were made, they did terrorism; set
the bomb in building, murder other people. The point of this was to
kill the bad social people who has done the corruptions. However, at
this time, a man( whose house was burned) did not like it because he
thought it is just terrible. At the end of movie he finally found who
has been his friend (who makes the soap).Yeah, his friend was himself.
It was his ego. As he did not like the world, he had made and planned
it everything. However he did not want to believe that his ego has done
these things.<br /><br />What if there is my ego at somewhere? What if even i know there is my
ego, I don&#39;t wanna know that I have an ego in the world? This movie
asks me about it.
