This movie is almost as schizophrenic as the lead character, played by Ed
Norton, is. The beginning is very promising with intelligent themes of the
evils of excess consumerism but then it fizzles and turns into a simple
action/suspense flick.<br /><br />Norton, the narrator, is a disgruntled office employee plagued by
insomnia.
He is fed up with the monotony in his work and his social life. He sees
our
society as one that forces its citizens to waste day after day at work so
they can buy things they don't need, but corporations say they do. Norton
goes through his life in a haze of boredom and mediocrity due to his
insomnia -- as he said, &quot;With insomnia you're never really asleep, and
you're never really awake.&quot;<br /><br />To stave off his feelings of detachment Norton begins to go to various
self-help groups even though he has no noticeable defects (at first
anyway).
Seeing people with severe problems (he frequents cancer patient forums
mostly) he begins to realize that maybe his life isn't so bad and he
begins
to sleep again. That is until he meets the vixen Marla Singer who is also
addicted to self-help groups. Because she doesn't need the therapy, he
sees
her as a phony. Soon he sees himself in her and, unable to tolerate her
presence, he quits going to group.<br /><br />With no outlet Norton relapses into his depression. That is until he meets
Tyler Durden played by Brad Pitt (who almost looks like a bodybuilder in
this role). Anyway, to move things along, Norton's condo is destroyed by
an
explosion and he's forced to move in with Durden and they subsequently
start
beating up on each other for thrills.<br /><br />Their fights become a form of therapy for Norton. He crawls out of his
depression and begins to feel a sense of worth. In the process he and
Durden
recruit other fighters who enjoy the &quot;therapy,&quot; and Fight Club begins to
take off.<br /><br />Humorous scenes abound when Norton begins to go to work with black eyes
and
bloody lips and his white-collar counterparts are stunned by his
appearance.
But unfortunately, the movie reaches its peak here and begins to go
downhill
fast.<br /><br />I won't comment too much on the last half or so of Fight Club because,
well,
I don't think it's worthy of mention. I'll just say this, there is a very
strange schizophrenic twist toward the end, but I don't think it's
believable. We've all heard the saying that goes something like this: &quot;You
know a mystery is good when you have some sort of idea of how it's going
to
end or who the culprits are.&quot; Well, the twist in Fight Club does not fit
precisely because it comes by such a surprise. It's almost as if the
producers had to meet a deadline so they threw in a few subplots to fill
reel space.<br /><br />Although fight club was somewhat of a bust for me I did take away two nice
morals: excess consumerism and excess therapy (especially Norton's
version)
are bad things.
