This film is great. It makes cinema worth it. Amidst the crap that
sometimes
makes it to screen, this production shines through. Money was not wasted
here, however much it cost to make.<br /><br />It is a cinematographically excellent movie. Gritty, atmospheric, textured,
plain and yet furiously detailed. Watching this film more than once is
definitely required, but it's certainly hard to get bored
of.<br /><br />Supporting this is the plot, which has depth and originality. Although it
can become confusing and is certainly questionable, this does not alter the
fact that it is wonderful. It follows the seemingly simple, button-down
life
of &quot;The Narrator,&quot; or JACK as the screenplay states, as it deteriorates
into
a system of mischief, violence and mayhem. It is concerned with the modern
role and social position of men and their relationships with women, but
this
serious undertone can be ignored. FIGHT CLUB also deals with the connected
issue of how the depression and mundane routines of working life can lead
(if obscurely) to such a psychotic aversion.<br /><br />Brilliant camera angles, integration of CGI, usage of voice-overs and
extremely clean cuts to complement a very able presence of humour, as well
as good acting and a simple but intelligent script make this film even
better.<br /><br />If you have not seen it and have an open mind for modern cinema, do so. The
whole screenplay was, as far as I know, adapted from a book. I intend to
read this and see how/if it alters my aspect of the film.
