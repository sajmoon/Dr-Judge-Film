Here is what the movie preaches:<br /><br />1.)  You have no choices in life.  Consumerism rules you.  You will buy
all
these things becuase you have no choice. The consumerism spirit will
magically make you buy everything and make you unhappy.  You cannot fight
the spirit.  It will rule you.  (Hmm no logic needed to accept these
things.)<br /><br />2.)  When Brad Pitt speaks, you must listen because of course a handsome
man
with no logic what so ever makes perfect sense.  When he says such
insightful things as &quot;we have no wars&quot;  I want to stand up and walk out of
the theater.<br /><br />3.)  Credit card companies losing all their records will save the world.
I
love the idea that these men thnk that a magic fairy will just come and
make
the debt disappear.<br /><br />4.)  Don't conform unless you conform to the idea that Communism is the
best
system possible.<br /><br />5.)  Despite the fact that Communism has destroyed Russia and China, it
still is a good idea to implement it here.  (Hmm Brad Pitt your logic
astounds me.)<br /><br />6.) You have no choices in life.  Give up your freedom for insane
dictators
like Tyler Durden who tell you basically how to live your
life.<br /><br />Yes a great film indeed.
