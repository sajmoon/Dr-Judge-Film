1999_December 24 

This film is an absolute gem. A film that everyone must see and I'm sure
will remain in their heads for a long time to come. The subtleties
contained
within it's many interesting scenes are intriguing and seeing it more than
once is recommended as I guarantee that the classic twist in the ending
will
provoke many interesting thoughts that just have to be confirmed by a
second
viewing. (just see it and you'll know what I mean!). Once again, a
masterpiece that should (nay must!) yield awards for the magnificent Edward
Norton and talented Brad Pitt.
