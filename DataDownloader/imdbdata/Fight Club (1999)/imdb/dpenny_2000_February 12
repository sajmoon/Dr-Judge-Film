Fight Club was a box office disappointment perhaps because no one really
knew what to make of it.  A lot of people went in to see Brad Pitt and
Edward Norton pounding each other, and instead got a subversive satire of
consumerism and the cult mentality.<br /><br />The movie may not have been appreciated in 1999, but I'll bet it will
quickly become a classic.  The recent protests at the WTO meetings in
Seattle showed that a backlash is brewing against rampant consumerism, and
while I don't necessarily agree with what many of the anti-WTO demonstrators
were saying, I get a feeling this movement is going to build up steam as
this new decade proceeds.<br /><br />And Fight Club speaks to that mentality.  Edward Norton plays a recall
investigator for a major car company (he decides whether it makes financial
sense to announce a recall) who has turned to a life of conspicuous
consumption to fill his spiritual void.  (In one astonishing sequence, he
literally walks into an IKEA catalog.)  Then he meets Tyler Durden, who
introduces him to the underground world of &quot;Fight Clubs&quot; - where men who
feel emasculated gather to get back to their roots by pounding the tar out
of each other.  But as Norton's character is sucked into this exciting new
world, his new compatriots decide to expand into society at large - with
potentially disastrous consequences.<br /><br />Many have called Fight Club a fascist movie (the debate was eerily similar
to what surrounded &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; in 1997) and I think this is way off
the mark.  Instead, the message is that if society trys to reduce a man to a
simple consumer, aimlessly following trends, he will inevitably lash out. 
This one will be watched, studied and debated long after, say, &quot;The
General's Daughter&quot; has been forgotten.
