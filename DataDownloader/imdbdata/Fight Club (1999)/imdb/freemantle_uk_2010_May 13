1999 was a great year for film, with many great films releases that
year: The Matrix, American Beauty, Being John Malkovich, Toy Story 2,
The Sixth Sense are just a few examples. To join them was Fight Club, a
controversial film based on a popular novel and directed by David
Fincher, a man whom career was on the up.<br /><br />Edward Norton play an insurance clerk who was suffering from insomnia
and struggles to deal with it. He starts by attending support groups
for people suffering from long term illnesses to cope with his issues.
Yet that disappears when Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) starts to
attend these meeting and takes away their edge. Whilst on a business
trip the man meets Travis Durden (Brad Pitt), a soap maker and
salesman. They quickly becomes friends and move in together into a
dilapidated house. They also start to take joy when having fights and
the popularity of these fights quickly expand into Fight Club. But
under Travis&#x27; leadership Fight Club soon takes an even darker turn and
it&#x27;s up to the man to stop him and his plot.<br /><br />Fincher is a very skilled director and with Fight Club he gives
audiences his most stylist film. He uses a lot of visual trick and
starts to play around a lot more with the camera. He shows confidence
with CGI and the nature of how it was used was fitting for the film.
There is a dark style and tone throughout, Fincher does not hold back
the violence or some of the more grim aspects of the film. There is a
lot of dark humour in the film, particularly during the early part of
the film. Fincher with a screenplay by Jim Uhls which is based on a
novel by Chuck Palahniuk tell a very complex story and there is a lot
of themes throughout. There are themes about people trying to find
their identity, how the human mind works, criticisms of modern
advertising and consumerism and how people could use it or become
hypocrites, how a cult would function and of course, man&#x27;s desire for
violence and destruction. Despite it&#x27;s title this film does not focus
to much on the underground fighting. This is an intelligent film which
will allow the audience to think.<br /><br />There is some excellent acting in this film with a great cast. Pitt and
Norton were brilliant in the lead roles, with Pitt having a potent
charisma throughout whilst Norton is effective as an everyman character
of the piece. Bonham Carter was also great in this film and these 3
actors were a dream team together.<br /><br />An excellent film.
