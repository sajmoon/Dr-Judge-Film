I knew the ending to Fight Club before watching it and I just wish I could
go back and not find out.   But I was still not going to be phased out and
just get on with it and enjoy.  I still didn't know the exact end only the
twist in it.  When people usually tell me there is a twist in films then it
is more obvious when it happens but I don't think anybody could have
predicted Fight Club's dark twist unless they had read the book in advance. <br /><br />We should be really hating The Usual Suspects, Seven and Fight Club because
these films made twists what they are today and that unstoppable.  Don't get
me wrong I loved the twists in those films just as much as you do but it
gave writers all the world the idea that every script in the world should
involve twists.  There are some good ones but in most they are obvious and
not original.   Fight Club took you into this story which made sense at
first and quite normal but we were just getting fooled to what eventually
happened in the fatal twist of events.   Edward Norton is the greatest actor
in this film and Brad Pitt is the coolest with Helen Boham cater as the
dirtiest which has to be said because she is a skank.
David Fincher's direction is as good as always and never stops to be more
than amazing till Panic Room of course.<br /><br />What I didn't like about fight Club was how Fight Club changed from
underground basement fighting to operation Mayhem without any real
explaining why.   Tyler does say something which is excusable but it wasn't
enough.  In the book they do it and I think it was very vital to explain it
in the movie but of course it wasn't which I think is a mistake on the
writers part.   Someone told me there was a deleted scene which explained it
a bit more thoroughly but it was obviously missed in the final cut.   Apart
from that Fight Club is as perfect than any film is ever going to
be.<br /><br />
