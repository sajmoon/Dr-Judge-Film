Most of us (by &quot;us&quot; I mean the people reading this article) lead
relatively predictable lives. And even if you lead an eventful life,
experience will in time make your life predictable. We cope, we make
our own little comfort zone and wallow in the illusion that we know
ourselves, our limits and possibilities. This seems to work, but sooner
or later you become hopelessly dependent on continuity. Every change
upsets you. We become incapable of change or growth. We just keep
within the bounds of expectations. This is what happens to all the
yuppies in The Fight Club. to end their jaded rut, they get caught up
in a constant quest for feeling, to convince themselves that they in
fact exist. And if nothing testifies to your unique importance, what
then? We'd all rather be hated then ignored. Neglected children tend to
seek attention by becoming (self-)destructive. And they are neglected.
By their fathers and then by modern society. Basically Tyler's Fight
Club revolves around reciprocated auto mutilation. But Tyler himself is
completely different. He's basically an ideal: smart, capable, free.
But his freedom has a price. Like an &uuml;bermensch, he could only become
what he is in adversity, and the destruction of, well, everything
contemporary society holds dear. So the question is: who's side are we
on? We can keep on being cogs in the relentless clockwork of modern
consumption society and its superimposed limitations and expectations.
Or we can throw it all away and become a Nietzschian &uuml;bermensch, living
in constant struggle. Neither sounds attractive to me. And in the end,
I can identify with Tyler, stuck as he is between an existential rock
and a hard place.I think that the movie doesn't give us an answer to
this problem. But I think it's bold enough to just pose the question,
even if it is buried under layers of grit and scabs. Maybe the Fight
Club isn't about that at all, but the movie is still impressive. Like
bite marks. <br /><br />Big up to Chuck, Jim, David, Brad, Edward and Helena!
