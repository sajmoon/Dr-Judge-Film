Brad pitt was always just one for the ladies.. 12 monkeys changed that and
this takes it one step further than Se7en. One of the most surprising
movies
I've seen as I thought it would be awful and it really delivers on all
counts, with (for once) intelligent use of a soundtrack. If you're only
gonna see 3 films from the nineties this has to be one of them. (I havent
worked out the other two yet...)
