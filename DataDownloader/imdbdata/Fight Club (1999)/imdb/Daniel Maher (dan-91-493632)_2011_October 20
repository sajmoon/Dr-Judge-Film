This movie absolutely changed me, and the way I perceive movies, people
and pretty much the whole world. Fight Club provides everything that I
look for in a movie, dark humor, awesome action, brilliant acting and a
strong sense of realism.<br /><br />Now that I got that out of the way lets begin.<br /><br />Fight club is really quite difficult to describe but thankfully the
movie provides many phrases that help so much in doing so, such as &#x27;you
have to know, not fear, know that someday you will die&#x27; or &#x27;how much
can you know about yourself if you&#x27;ve never been in a fight&#x27;. The movie
itself is very dark and occasionally rather disturbing but it also
manages to balance this out with with a strong plot and fantastic
performances by the whole cast. Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena
Bonham Carter give the performances of their careers and really help
the films brilliant writing and fantastic story development. This film
also contains one of the best plot twists in history, but I won&#x27;t spoil
it.<br /><br />In conclusion I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys dark,
gritty but intelligent movies should definitely give this one a watch.
