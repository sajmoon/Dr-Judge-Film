David Fincher has to be described as one of the best director of the 1990's
and beyond.  The lighting used in &quot;Fight Club&quot; (florescent lighting) was
perfect for the movie.  This movie is yet another success for this young
actor, and it is great to see him continuing to use his trademark
'darkness'
in this movie.  With a brilliant cast of characters, this just adds to the
reasons why it scores a 10 in my opinion.  I continue to anticipate his
next
directorial project.
