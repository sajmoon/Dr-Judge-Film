What's fascinating in David Fincher's work,is that it seems we deal
with an auteur.He created his own universe,a nocturnal and filthy
one,and a bit misogynous too:it's glaring in this movie;outside
Bonham-Carter-made look ugly and dressed as a 1977 punk-,only a black
woman has a line to say.Almost everywhere,it is a man's man's world
where no women appear even in the settings.<br /><br />This movie was influenced by famous and not-so-famous predecessors:of
course &quot;Dr Jekill and Mister Hide&quot; to which Bonham Carter hints at in
the restaurant,&quot;a clockwork orange&quot; ,&quot;rebel without a cause&quot; &quot;bad
influence&quot; and Joel Schumacher's &quot;falling down&quot;,the latter seems with
hindsight to have been overlooked and underrated.<br /><br />So why does this movie seem so original?it owes a lot to E.Norton (more
than Pitt)who had already overshadowed R.Gere in &quot;primal fear&quot;.Here he
plays a very strange kind of peeping tom:watching mental suffering
(therapy groups ,dealing almost essentially with male problems),then
physical sufferings,eventually enduring them.Does he do that as he
would opt for yoga,Buddhism or psychotherapy,to escape from a routine
work?To get free from the material world?As Pitt says &quot;the things
you...&quot;The problem is that Norton does not seem to be so free.At
first,he may be, when he's only a simple spectator-and the scenes in
the restaurant and in the projection room are peaks of black
humor-,but,he's potentially a Stevensonian hero.<br /><br />There's a big coup de theatre in this movie, a breathtaking and
unexpected twist ,&agrave; la &quot;sixth sense&quot; ,&quot;Jacob's ladder&quot; or&quot; Usual
suspects&quot; ,and it's difficult to comment this movie :all you say is
questioned when you KNOW.Of course I won't reveal it,but I think it's
the biggest flaw of the movie.Unlike the three mentioned works,this
does not seem logical,because of the lack of &quot;clues&quot;:the only one
,regarding Bonham-Carter, is not really convincing.<br /><br />The last picture seems now terrifying.
