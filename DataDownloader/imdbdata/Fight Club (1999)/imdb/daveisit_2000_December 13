Well it was a nice story, and so realistic. I'm sure most normal humans
are pretty keen to take on an existence such as the one portrayed in
&quot;Fight Club&quot;. <br /><br />Surely the percentage of people in this world don't enjoy fighting.
Fight Club made this out to be one of America's favourite pastimes.
I've spent significant time in the USA and never saw one fight.<br /><br />It was a dull and boring movie, and I suggest Eddie Norton takes a good
hard look at himself before being involved with a script like that
again. Helena too. As for Bradles, after accepting a part in &quot;Legends
of the Fall&quot;, nothing surprises me with his movie selections, even
though the boy has talent. <br /><br />I feel this was more like some kind of hardcore modern fairytale as
opposed to a realistic society pastime.
