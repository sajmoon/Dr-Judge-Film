1999_November 23 

This is not like the newspaper reviews, or the adverts, or even the
trailer.The film of the trailer would have been quite good. I was expecting
that much. The film of the novel would have been nice, and witty, i was
expecting that much. This is the film, though, and it shouldn't have turned
out like this. It's, in short, better than you can possibly imagine. It does
what you want. I don't want to describe the plot or praise the cast but just
mention how rotten it makes everything I've seen since look. It's ruined me,
and it will not go away. So, if you want to see a film, don't see this. If
you want to have an experience, risk it. And nobody mentions how funny it
is.
