Wow, unlike the very OVERRATED American Beauty, which won the best picture
Oscar (What was the academy thinking?!), 1999's other film about mid-life
crises, Fight Club, at least had the guts to say what was on it's mind
without the complete hypocrisy found in American Beauty! Sure, Fight Club
used anarchy to prove the point that American society is based on
commericalism, but at least it wasn't hypocritical like American Beauty was!
Great acting from Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, great social commentary, and
great direction from the always terrific David Fincher makes Fight Club the
best film of 1999! A 10 on a scale o 1-10!
