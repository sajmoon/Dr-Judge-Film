<br /><br />Woah!  Wait a sec, what was that?  OK, I don't want to get too excited and
overstate anything so let's try again... Fight Club is the Best Movie of
All
Time. Holy cow, so why?<br /><br />This is a story about an ordinary guy.  You can relate to this guy.  He
could be the guy you sit next to on the bus.  He could be the guy you work
with.  He could be your closest friend.  He could be you, or me.  An
ordinary guy, a guy you know.  A guy you can relate to and feel involved
with.  Now what possibly could happen to an ordinary guy that's so
interesting that some anonymous person on the Internet says it's the best
movie of all time...<br /><br />Well, many things I guess.  There are lots of movies about ordinary guys
that have interesting stuff happen to them.  So why is this one so
good?<br /><br />It's cool.  Ed Norton is cool.  Brad Pitt is cool.  Helena Bonna Carter is
cool.  Hey, I never thought I'd say this but even Meat Loaf is cool.  If
they were your friends, you'd be the coolest kid in school.  No question.
You feel cool just watching this movie.  The story is a little out there,
but hey, that's all part of the fun.<br /><br />The Dust Brothers are the pulse behind the action that sets the momentum
for
the film.  From the opening credits we are into the action and from there
it
doesn't stop.  It doesn't slow down; it just takes you on a ride, which if
you let it, will take you to a place worth visiting over and over
again.<br /><br />Although a great movie, it is not for everyone.  So don't kid yourself.
If
you don't like violence in movies you won't like this movie.  If you don't
like being confronted you won't like this movie. Some seemingly
misunderstand the message behind the film, or take it too literally.  If
you're not sure, and you're going to view this movie I urge you to keep an
open mind.<br /><br />Ed Norton &amp; Brad Pitt both give their best performances to date.  They are
cast so well and are believable in their rolls.  But you know the best
thing
about this movie?  Well, I cannot tell you.  Can I suggest you stop
reading
the user comments now or some idiot will spoil it for you.  Just see it.
Take the ride. 10/10
