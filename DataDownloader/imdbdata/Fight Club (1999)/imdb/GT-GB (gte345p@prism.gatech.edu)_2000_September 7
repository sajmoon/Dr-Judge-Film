Wow.  What a movie.  Please don't deprive yourself of this amazing
spectacle
of filmmaking.  Like many others I made the mistake of not seeing this film
based on bad reviews and my friends' opinions, thinking to myself &quot;why
would
I want to see a bunch of guys beat the hell out of each other for two
hours?&quot;  How wrong they were, and how wrong I was.  The actual &quot;Fight Club&quot;
itself is a prop for the characters to explore the seamy underbelly of the
shallow existence of 1990's corporate America.  I remember years ago a film
by the name of Blade Runner opened up to bad reviews and eventually flopped
at the box office, but now it is hailed as a revolutionary, groundbreaking
piece of sci-fi cinema.  I feel that as more and more people become exposed
to fight club it will achieve this status as well.  See it as soon as
possible so that years from now when your friends talk about what a vitally
important movie this is in the landscape of American cinema, you can say
you
knew about it all along.
