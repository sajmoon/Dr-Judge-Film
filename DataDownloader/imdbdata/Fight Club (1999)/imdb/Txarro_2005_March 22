This film is absolutely magnificent. Every time I watch it again I
discover something new in it, a new detail that makes it better. The
screenplay and the low-motion takes are great. Before to see it, I
thought that Brad Pitt was only a sissy that only makes films for
girl's pleasure, but all my mind changed with his interpretation in
this movie.<br /><br />When I read the title, I thought &quot;OK, another stupid American movie
with no script and based only in the violence&quot;, but if you watch the
first 15 minutes, you will be getting catched little by little by the
strange but amazing story.<br /><br />One of the best movies I've seen in all my life
