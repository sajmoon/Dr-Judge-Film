Possibly one of the best films I have seen in a LONG time.  David
Fincher's
dark, gritty style of filming along with Jeff Cronenweth's superb
cinematography give Fight Club a visual style that makes you feel dirty
just
watching it.  Jim Uhls' adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel is faithful
to
both the book's original story, anti-society based themes and nihilistic
attitude, and after reading and watching both, it's hard to say which I
like
more.<br /><br />Despite my distaste for him as an actor, Brad Pitt was EXCELLENT as Tyler
Durden, though at times (very rarely), I did feel as if he didn't really
believe in what he was saying.  Edward Norton, one of today's most
underrated, tallented and versatile actors, stands out as The Narrator,
subservient office sheep one second, nihilistic underground terrorist the
next.  And Helena Bonham Carter is surprisingly good as Marla Singer, the
perpetual thorn in The Narrator's side.<br /><br />All in all, 10 out of 10, 100%; an EXCELLENT piece of cinematic
history.
