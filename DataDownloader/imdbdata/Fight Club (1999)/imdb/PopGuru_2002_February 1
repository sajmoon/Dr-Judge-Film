This is most likely one of the best movies that my generation will have
the
honor of seeing in the big screen. And it is amazing that it ever
materialized. It has a huge budget for a film of this type, well actually
there has never been anything quite like this before. When I first went to
see it I though &quot;Oh great some beat-them-up that stars Brad Pitt.&quot; After I
came out of the theatre I knew that this is a miracle. If you haven't seen
this film I have two words for you: SEE IT!
For the first(and probably the only) time all of the directors visions
have
been put to the screen with the scy being the limit for the
budget.
