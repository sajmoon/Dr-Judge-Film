It's difficult to rank the best movies of all time in a precise order. For
instance, if I was forced to rank mine, Pulp Fiction would probably be #1,
although I couldn't for the life of me explain why I liked it better then
Clockwork Orange or Reservoir Dogs, which would be 2 and 3 on my list if I
had to make one. All 3 are fantastic and not deserving of being ranked
below
the other. All you can really do is group movies into groups, those that
are
great, those that are good, those that are bad, and those that are
horrible.
The first and last group should be a very select group, with only a few
members in each. Those 3 movies listed above would be in the first group
for
me. On that short list would be Seven and yes, Fight Club.<br /><br />Fight Club is amazing, funny as it is serious, thought-provoking as it is
graphic, it's genius in my opinion. I've read all the naysayers, and
there's
a place for everyone's opinion ( I won't say where that place is for
some),
but this movie is great (although still a notch below Seven). After a
decent
yet disappointing try with the Game, Fincher delivers another masterpiece
here. Norton is great, Pitt (a true hit or miss guy if I've ever seen one)
is excellent, the direction perfect, the story enthralling, dialogue
clever.
I could go on forever. But rather then bore you with my opinions any
further, how about I just sum it up with this:If you haven't seen it, make
it your next rental. Or purchase. Half the people that see it won't like
it,
but those that do will love it.
