2003_November 8 

For several years I avoided &quot;Fight Club&quot; because I was under the
impression
it was a blood and guts Van-Damme type film.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />This is a psychological horror film.<br /><br />The opening credits and the music that accompanied them are among the
most
rousing film openings I've ever seen.  I remember thinking, &quot;If the film
lives up to the excitement and urgency of the credits, we're in for a
ride.&quot;
And I was.<br /><br />I took a lot away from this movie. Lots of little truths that make you
squirm. &quot;The things you own end up owning you.&quot;<br /><br />I gave this a 10 because it is infinitely re-watchable and - like any
great
Hitchcock film - the more you watch, the more you see.<br /><br />
