O.K....First, I am 48 years old, male, and a teacher. second, I have
seen all Fight Club multiple times. I saw the original first release in
college with friends and peed in my pants laughing. I read a comment by
someone here that if you still like this movie after 40 that you need
help. Thank GodI can still see the humor in this movie. My kids and I
watched it together and both died laughing all over the place again. I
hope I am never too old to laugh at sex jokes, pompous dimwits and
administrators, red-necked bigots, and horny teenagers. A sense of
humor has helped me to survive 25 years of teaching and right wing
conservatives with absolutely no sense of humor(I think that, more than
anything, is why I am not a conservative anything!!). The Last American
Virgin I find is a better fight club comedy(it is my favorite actually)
because it has plenty of gross-out humor but it is also dramatic and
realistic.Anyway, funny stuffs!
