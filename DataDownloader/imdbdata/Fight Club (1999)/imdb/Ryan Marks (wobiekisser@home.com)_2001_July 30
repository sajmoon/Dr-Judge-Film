&quot;Fight Club&quot; opens up with Brad Pitt and Edward Norton at the top of a
building. Brad Pitt has a gun in Norton's mouth. Norton is Jack, the
narrator throughout. Then he tells us his whole story, and how he got to
where he is right now. The movie ends at the top of that building after the
unfolding of a brilliant twist at the end. It's a mind-blowing movie about
how the two guys start underground &quot;fight clubs&quot; where guys can get out
their anger buy pummeling the crap out of eachother. Edward Norton is
sensational as the confused insomniac that narrates the story. Brad Pitt is
also enthralling as Tyler Durden. The soap salesman that Jack (Norton)
meets
on a plane ride. I advise you to hold on to your seats, for the most
brilliant,amazing and emotionally powerful film, ever made.
