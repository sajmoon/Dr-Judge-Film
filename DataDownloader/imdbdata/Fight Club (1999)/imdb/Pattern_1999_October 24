An awesome movie, but certainly not for everyone. If you liked Se7en or
Fallen or 12 Monkeys, you'll probably like Fight Club. It will toy with your
brain and show you the most unlikely of things. To say more would ruin the
movie as you need to have no clue what the movie is about in order to enjoy
it. Brad Pitt is excellent, yet again. However, he is not the whole movie -
the entire cast of this mind-bender does an unbelievable job. The editing
and writing are also great. The movie will keep your attention
throughout.
