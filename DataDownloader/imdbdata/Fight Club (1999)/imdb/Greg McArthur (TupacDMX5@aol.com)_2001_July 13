For one, enough with those that call this film a waste with no morality,
consequences, or point. This film dug deep into the idealism that would
drive any man mad. This film pushed the point that possessions, money,
idealistic thinking, and the social fabric of this world can and will push
any man to the point of retaliation. I know that this man had problems
because he was an insomniac and projected the image he always wished
himself
to be. People don't realize that the point was for this man to become
someone he always wanted, a free man that can do as he pleased. Fight Club
was not a movie about a psycho who got a bunch of guys together to form a
cult to destroy the social fabric of this world. It was about a man who was
sick and tired of the phonies, pointless possesions, lies, and bondage in a
life he could not escape. This man found a way out of the idealism and
projected an image of himself that was buried deep in his mind. Everything
pushed him to the point where this man became a normal part of his life.
Little did he know though that he was this man, and was performing
everything he witnessed. He found a way out and shared it with other men.
For the first time in these mens lives, they felt free and rejuvinated. If
their is no point in that, I don't know where it is. The consequences did
not come to these men, it came to the world that trapped them in a social
slavery. It came to the world that pushed them to do this, and if that is
immoral, too bad, the immorality came from the world. The point is harder
to
realize. The point basically to me is that people need to find a way out.
That their is no point in living a life that leads nowhere. If it takes
creating a group of obsessed brainwashed men to show this world how to be
free, than so be it. But people need to get out of a life that has no
point,
if that's the case, what's the point of even living. For the first time in
these mens lives they felt like they were a part of something noble,
important, and felt like they were living for something. I was happy to
actually see a film that showed how phony and pointless some films really
are. This film had many points. The points are deep and are really decided
by the viewer. But to say that this film has no point or dosen't even
deserve to be called a film is preposterous.<br /><br />Definately one of my favorites.
