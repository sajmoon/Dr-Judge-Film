If films are the modern day answer to fine art, this film is a Mona Lisa.
Ed
Norton and Brad Pitt are brilliant! The title really does downplay the
complexity of this movie, this is not some modern day gladiator film. This
is a film about people, our attachment to &quot;things&quot; and the true importance
of living! Necessity versus Luxury. Amen!
