Fight Club was a brilliant movie in more ways than one. I did not have any
expectations about the movie other than good performances by Ed Norton and
Brad Pitt. Turns out all the actors were great in the movie. I was
completely shocked by the plot of the film, maybe a little surprised since
Fincher's last two films were two of my favorites as well. This had a more
transcendental of the three and in some ways, a lot more lighter in tone. I
wouldn't have thought that this movie was going to be that hilarious! I was
blown away by the ending. Pardon the pun. I recommend this to anybody that
wants to appreciate a brain twister, to people that don't mind a little
challenge.  I must say though that you better keep up or you will fall
behind. A terrific movie. Kudos to everyone involved in making this
film.
