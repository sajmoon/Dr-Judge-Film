This one-of-a-kind movie grabs my mind and heart from fade-in to fade-out.
The insomniac narrator keeps the audiences widely awake along the
presentation about how many parts of our lives are actually
meaningless.<br /><br />Edward Norton performs convincingly as a guy who screams out of the boredom
of his days just to find the exciting new life during his sleepless nights.
This new life includes serial visitation to support groups where he meets
the disturbingly charming Marla (played disturbingly haunting by Helena
Bonham-Carter). While he's wishing that his plane will crash, suddenly the
charismatic Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt at his best!) appears, and brings him to
a whole new (underground) world.<br /><br />They both invent the fight club, and in this fighting community they
struggle for peace and better life. Actually, it is not the story that
counts, but the values and twists. Based on the novel of the same title by
Chuck Palahniuk, &quot;Fight Club&quot; changes the paradigms of everyday life:
countering neatly ordered life, blasting consumerism, and glorifying
chaos.<br /><br />The dark and compelling ambience is successfully achieved by director David
Fincher. The opening title is as breath-taking as the ending of this
movie.<br /><br />This film is a legend!
