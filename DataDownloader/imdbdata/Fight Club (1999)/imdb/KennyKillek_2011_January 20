I just got done watching Fight Club, and I have to say it is one of the
most content-packed films ever made. By saying that I mean you have an
exploitative, fun, mindless action movie shell that everyone enjoys,
but at the same time there are so many underlying themes that literally
EVERYONE can come up with a completely different interpretation. But
like I said at the same time the movie is so much fun, poking fun at
itself with lines like &#x22;We can&#x27;t all be movie stars&#x22; spoken by Brad
Pitt, a movie star, and of course, the dude&#x27;s junk spliced in at the
end is just beautifully hilarious. Overall, fantastic movie that I
recommend to anyone and everyone that can stomach some rather harsh
violence
