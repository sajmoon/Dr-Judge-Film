This is not just a movie for guys, it is a movie for everyone.  The acting
is perfect and the directing is right on.  The movie is never dull, never
boring.  It does not have a single slow moment - but it does have a plot -
an incredible plot.  Despite what you may think, THIS MOVIE IS NOT ABOUT
FIGHTING!
