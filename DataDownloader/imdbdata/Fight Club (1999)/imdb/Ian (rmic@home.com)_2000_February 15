This film, is basically, at least in my opinion, one of the greatest films
ever, period.  I read the book afterwards, and equally enjoyed the book.
The film is definitely for younger people, the critics of films, in general
are older, so they cannot appreciate this film.  The film defines the
younger generation, only younger people can relate to it, however, older
people(middle aged+) can appreciate the art of the film, the beauty of the
camera work, as well as the excellent acting.  The film, in every aspect is
fantastic, it begins with a rather humorous narration, from a person we grow
to know as, &quot;narrator&quot;.  It goes about to show how he lives, and his way of
life.  In these scenes alone, movie lines that will go down in history are
said, and it's only the first twenty minutes.  The film tends to progress
faster and faster as the film continues.  We delve into the narrators
psyche, and find that he is not unlike most people in this world, he has a
tendency to say to people what they want to hear, even if it is not the
truth in it's entirety.  Almost all folks can relate to the main character,
and he feels to be a real human, not a character in a story.  This, is
partially due to the excellent directing, as well as book, but it is mostly
due to the fantastic performance by Edward Norton. It, in my opinion is an
Oscar performance.  Bradd Pitt gives his best performance to date, he is
definitely an excellent coworker with David Fincher, they seem to share a
common thread when it comes to film making I suppose.  I have full intention
of purchasing this film when it is released on VHS and DVD.  Do yourself a
favour, see this film, if that is not an option, at least read the book.  If
you are younger and feel unrest with society, this is the film.
