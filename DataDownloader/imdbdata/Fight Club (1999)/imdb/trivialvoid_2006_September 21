So people out there still don&#39;t know how to read between the lines? As
I read some of the posts about this movie it dawned on me why I am
still feeling spoon fed by most movies out there. There are postings
here around pages 4 and 5 that confirmed to me that spoon feeding is
still greatly needed. So since &#39;Fight Club&#39; didn&#39;t do it, I&#39;ll try.<br /><br />First....to those of you that didn&#39;t get the &quot;meaning&quot; of this pic,
I&#39;ll give you the quick in&#39;s and out&#39;s of what you missed. In a few
posts people didn&#39;t see the correlation between &quot;Project Mayhem&quot;, Tyler
and the actual fight club itself. If you listen to whats being
&quot;preached&quot; by Tyler, it&#39;s all relative to the rebellion that is fight
club. The club and the project are one in the same. The platform for
the rebellion. Why is this Club? Because there is a dumbed down society
where people are like blind, deaf and dumb sheep following the likes of
tabloid centerfolds. A world where e.mail and internet sex has replaced
human contact. Where emotion has gone and numbness ensues. A world
where people are so starved for human contact and restrained from one
another by cubical walls that the response is &quot;G** D*** it.....hit me
so I feel SOMETHING.&quot; The ever over done metaphor that compares humans
to rats running thru a maze; cubicle&#39;s are the walls of the maze and
Starbux is the reward around every corner. Taking down the structure
that creates this sense of irrelevance is the concept of the project.
Like getting hit in the face, an act of rebellion is simply a natural,
primal cry for the attention that has been replaced by ads that
represent your demographic and plaques on benches after someone has
died. Is it a far cry for anyone to try and imagine a world where we as
Americans work the same hours and have the same value on family and
friends and humanity as other cultures do? Can we get back to the time
when we felt a bond with our earth and not that guy in the Dockers
commercial? Can we ever reconnect with people and do less in the way of
super-powerdom and more in the way of living the life that we only live
once? Tyler.....<br /><br />What he is, that so many missed, is an enraged subconscious that
allowed a man to break free of the mundane. Not because he was middle
aged and not because a middle aged man needed to appeal to the younger
demographic, but because a man was driven insane by the inhuman world
we live in needed to break away. This character wasn&#39;t calling out the
economic structure....but the sociological structure of the United
States. He and other characters were made to be living strange and
&quot;sleazy&quot; lives because that seems to be a common way for people to try
and live outside the restraints of the &quot;socially acceptable&quot; since the
socially acceptable is the only way to fit in to the cookie-cutter
mold. Have you never felt so spoon fed that you just wanted to &quot;roam
the halls&quot; and show and tell people that we are living a fabricated
life in a prepackaged world.<br /><br />I understand that there are a lot of people that haven&#39;t been as
exposed to the phenomenon of plastic wrap and cup-cozies as others like
myself. Big city life, and the everlasting fight to keep commerce on
its feet because Paris Hilton told us that that is what&#39;s &quot;hot&quot;, is
unfortunately what we&#39;ve become as a culture. What should be important
to us is gone. Don&#39;t believe me? Ask your kids these two questions:
What does Starbux do for you? What do blueberries do for you?
