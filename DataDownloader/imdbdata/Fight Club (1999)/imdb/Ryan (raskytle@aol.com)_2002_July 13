I first saw this movie when it was first released on video a few years
ago.
I already knew the main jist of the ending unfortunately due to the Rosie
O'Donnell Show, who hated it.<br /><br />Rosie hated it for the same reason most people hate it.  Either someone
goes
into the movie expecting a movie about guys who start an underground
boxing
ring and that's what the movie is about, and when they see the movie is
not
about violence they get turned off and never get into the movie.  Or
someone
watches the movie, sees some blood or violence, and then ignores the rest
of
the movie.  If you think this movie is about violence, you're an idiot.
This is one of the most anti-violent movies I have ever
seen...<br /><br />Fight Club is about many things.  The resentment of lifestyle standards
imposed by advertising; the longing for fathers; numbness and alienation;
finding self-empowerment through drastic means; you have to break yourself
apart to build something new; fame, beauty, wealth, immortality, life
without pain, are promised...but impossible.  To get these from the movie
you have to pay attention to the movie, be open to the movie, think about
the movie, and rewatch it as many times as you can stand.  Which is sad...
not a sad thing on the movie's part, but on the viewer's
part.<br /><br />This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time, and I love all
movies.
While I love all movies, few are my favorite, but my favorite are very
diverse.  For example some of my other favorite movies include Almost
Famous, The Usual Suspects, Dogma, and That Thing You Do!<br /><br />David Fincher is one of my favorite directors.  Se7en i thought was a
really
really good movie, but personally I think its a tad over rated.  The Game
was just a cool movie to sit back and think of life as... a game.  Panic
Room i just thought sucked and was no different than any other
hostage/terrorist type movie.  But Fight Club is his true work of art.  A
lot of people don't see Fight Club at art... and those people arn't people
who understand art.  They think art has to be some nice Picasso painting,
a
foreign film they don't understand, or some Van Gough in the museum that
they hate going to.  They don't understand that everything is art,
nowadays
especially things that are dark and hard to understand.<br /><br />If you see this movie and hate it, don't automatically dismiss it.  If you
love it, don't just stop at buying the DVD.  READ THE BOOK.  The book and
the movie go hand-in-hand.  It doesn't matter if you read the book first,
or
see the movie first.  Just make sure you see the movie at least 3 times,
and
read the book at least once.  And don't try and compare the two, take them
in as one.  The book gives you light on parts of the movie, and the movie
helps you see parts of the book better.  Just don't dismiss this as a
teenage/college kid movie.  Because its not, if anything its a middle-age
men movie.  But most of them are scared to have their whole life torn
down,
so teenage/college kids accept the facts of Fight Club before it takes
over
their lives.<br /><br />This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time, and I love all
