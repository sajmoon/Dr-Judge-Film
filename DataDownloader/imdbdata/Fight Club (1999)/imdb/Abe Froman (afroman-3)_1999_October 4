1999_October 4 

You would only do a flick like Fight Club if you had total disregard for
the
opinion of (so called) critics, because of the gargantuan leap into
unknown
territory.  Fight Club is more of an experience than a 2-hour way to
forget
yourself.  It could of been 5 hours, I would not have known the
difference.
Although dark, it is truly the best film I have seen, period.  Pitt and
Norton are both genius...truly out there as actors.<br /><br />The range of Fincher is amazing...dark to serious to funny to Holy
Crap!<br /><br />See what happens when you take a chance?  Must see.
