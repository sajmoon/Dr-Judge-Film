This film is one you'll have to see a second time. I did. You'll see the
twist in the end, just not believe it, then have to watch it all over
again
to see how it could be. Thing is, I usually lose my enthusiasm for a film
the second time I watch it, cos its all still fresh in my memory, but this
wasn't the case at all with Fight Club. The three leads are in my opinion
three of the finest film actors on earth, and the director is right up
there
with two other Davids - Cronenberg and Lynch - as one of the best
directors
in history, and I can say that confidently after just seeing Se7en, Fight
Club and The Game, all of which are brilliant psychological
pieces.
Fight Club is original, clever and intriguing. I'm not quite sure of
Finscher's politics, but his artistry and intelligence are beyond doubt.
This film will amaze you.
