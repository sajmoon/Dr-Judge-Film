2000_November 21 

When I was first told by a friend to go see &quot;Fight Club,&quot;  I rolled my
eyes.
Why would I want to go see a movie about men beating the hell out of each
other?  But thankfully, I decided to give it a try.  As soon as the tape
ended, I immediately rewound it and began it again.  As an employee of a
Video Store, I see countless numbers of movies each week, yet made a
conserted effort to watch Fight Club at least once every few days until I
finally purchased it.  The depth of this film is so much more then any
initial criticism may have revealed.  &quot;Fight Club&quot; is a comment on
gendered
socialization.  It comments on the evils of capitalism and the selfishness
that rears its head daily in the rat race which Americans see as the norm.
This film manages to analyze and interpret our entire civilized culture in
all its complicated aspects in just a little over 2 hours.  And even
amongst
the critique and powerful messages, it manages some of the most
intelligent
and witty dialog that Hollywood has seen since &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; in
this
critic's eye.  As a 22 year old feminist, many people look at me oddly
when
I proclaim &quot;Fight Club&quot; as my favorite film.  But those cynical
individuals
have yet to see Fincher's masterpiece. *****
