When Fincher made se7en everybody was talking about it. I first thought
that it was for Brad Pitt, but when I saw fight club I understood that
this director was certainly one of the best of the world. Se7en was so
brilliant but fight club was like an electric shock. I consider this
film as my second favorite movie and the fact that I suffer from
insomnia myself has everything to do with it. The film deserves a 10/10
only for Edward Norton's performance ( he's my favorite actor after
Gary Oldman ). It is amazing to see the perfection of the movie even in
the details like the clothes. The story goes so far up to the end which
is enclosed by a great hit of Pixies, that it's a pleasure of every
moment. I'm sorry my English is not so good.
