This film is often misunderstood, and usually by people that feel that
masculinity is not only something to be derided but, worse, forgiven, as if
being male was some type of sin.<br /><br />While it does, indeed, spin off into odd and unusual places politically, it
does make a powerful impact. (Pun intended.) Norton, Pitt, Bonham-Carter and
yes, even Meat Loaf, are each giving in this film some of their collective
best work. <br /><br />Even the make up deserves mention. Usually, one thinks of make up in terms
of Planet of the Apes. Here, it is subtle. Varieties of bruised flesh cross
the screen, simple, small scars underscore the film's point. (For fans: Ever
notice how the bus driver's nose has been broken?) <br /><br />A very daring work, often maligned for it's speed and flash.
