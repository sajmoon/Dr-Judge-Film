IT just blow my mind, The photography is awesome, and the story , very
dark , anarchist, it really open my eyes, feel very very (too much?)
similar to &quot;the narrator&quot; I must say I watch this movie one per
week,It's full of black humor that is so brilliant played by E Norton.<br /><br />Masterpiece of Fincher , not for everyone, and by far it's not a movie
about people fighting for god sake.It has a very very actual powerful
message<br /><br />Edward Norton and B.Pitt at their best, and the Voice over used very
very well.<br /><br />And I love that the end is so &quot;non Hollywood &quot;style!!! not always the
good wins and everyone is happy.
