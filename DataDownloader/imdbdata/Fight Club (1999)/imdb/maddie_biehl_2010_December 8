Chuck Palahniuk creates thrilling, captivating works for the mind of
his readers. He is the author of 14 novels, two of which have already
been made into movies and three other novels being considered or
already in production to be major motion pictures. The first of
Palahniuk books to move to film was Fight Club. Fight Club is a
gripping page-turner unable to be put down until you realize you&#x27;ve
read through the entirety of it in one sitting. Luckily, the movie held
true to the book and might&#x27;ve even done a better job telling the story
of Tyler Durden. The twisting thriller keeps you suspended until it
blows your mind. The actors in Fight Club carry the movie
fantastically; Edward Norton as the narrator, Brad Pitt as Tyler
Durden, and Helena Bonham Carter as Marla Singer. Norton narrates as a
character in the movie that moves in a run down house with Tyler Durden
and then shares the life of Tyler Durden with the viewers. Marla
Singer, the antagonist works her way into their lives, driving them
crazy. To unleash their building frustration and deal with their excess
testosterone, Norton and Pitt create what they call &#x22;Fight Club&#x22;. &#x22;The
first rule of Fight Club is do not talk about Fight Club.&#x22; The subtle
hints in this film foreshadow beautifully. Small special effects and
the ability to physically see the raise of an eyebrow or hear the
narration while watching a fight scene actually happen add up to
effectively blow your mind and make you question how you didn&#x27;t see
anything coming. The director, David Fincher, certainly shows his skill
through this film. Seeing Fight Club and another of his dark, intense
movies, Seven, it&#x27;s simple to day this man has a unique vision. Fight
Club is a must see. 10/10!
