Wildly original and intriguing. Pitt and Norton are excellent. It was on
the
way to being one of the best pictures the year, then it lost everything in
the final 25 minutes. I don't know why they had to twist the end of the
story like that...very disappointing, considering how good the first hour
and a half were.
