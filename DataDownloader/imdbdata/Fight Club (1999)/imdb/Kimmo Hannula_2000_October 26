Fight Club is one of those films that make you think after you`ve seen it
that what the hell happened. This film is never in any way boring in any
scene, fantastic acting and the filming was just out of this world. This
is
not just some kicking ass or hitting somebody hard in the face film but
much
much more than that. So if you want to see one of the best films ever made
go and see Fight Club. I guarantee you that you wont be sorry!!!!
