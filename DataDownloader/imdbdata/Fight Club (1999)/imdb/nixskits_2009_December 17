It amuses me when some person goes on a talk show and tells people not
to see a film! The reaction to &#x22;Fight Club&#x22; and others by certain
mouthy types (who might have even seen it!) was really a dumb approach
to avoiding attention directed at what they perceive as dangerous.
Michael Medved was a bit less silly in his various objections over the
years than others (Kathie Lee Gifford for instance), as a critic having
watched Oliver Stone&#x27;s &#x22;JFK&#x22;, which he called &#x22;an evil film&#x22; and
&#x22;Natural Born Killers&#x22; (he described it as a lot of things, among them,
&#x22;never boring&#x22;, in his pan review).<br /><br />So here we are, ten years after this David Fincher directed adaptation
of Chuck Palahniuk&#x27;s novel (Jim Uhls wrote the screenplay). Blu-ray is
the new standard for watching discs at home and &#x22;FC&#x22; has just come out
in this format (with an adorably annoying &#x22;Never Been Kissed&#x22; initial
menu pop up showing everyone&#x27;s favourite friend of Edward Norton, Drew
Barrymore!). I&#x27;ll buy it eventually. For now, the old two disc special
edition will hold up just fine with it&#x27;s four commentary tracks
(including one with Palahniuk and Uhls). The world is much more screwed
up than a decade ago and almost all of that is definitely not the fault
of &#x22;FC&#x22; or any other work which doesn&#x27;t pretend joining hands and
singing &#x22;Kumbaya&#x22; will make our species love itself and end our crises.<br /><br />&#x22;FC&#x22; is like a street and book wise reaction to infomercials that
promise some help for the unhappy and broken in society. Any mature
adult has reached the conclusion that the bad things in life make up at
least half of what even the best adjusted of us must cope with. &#x22;Jack&#x22;,
the ultimate unreliable narrator, is burnt out. His life degenerates
into travelling as a paid stooge for a big company, weighing whether
paying people for what money can&#x27;t make up in losses works for his
bosses. He doesn&#x27;t just hit rock bottom, he orders Furni (read, IKEA!)
products from there! How much can a person have left of their soul when
they are drawn to 12 step meetings for conditions nobody in their right
mind wants to cope with?<br /><br />So when the tag team from new friend hell emerge, &#x22;Marla&#x22; and &#x22;Tyler&#x22;,
&#x22;Jack&#x22; is drawn to both of their live for today spirits. He&#x27;s such a
function of the clock, going out into the world without a watch and an
itinerary is his ultimate rebellion. The question is, how long can the
narrator keep up with the dastardly duo who shock and invigorate him?<br /><br />There&#x27;s a wonderful collection of essays on the film, some long and
complex, others short and to the point. Not many movies can warrant a
book about what started as a book. &#x22;Fight Club&#x22; remains as a phoenix
rising out of show biz&#x27;s late 90s ashes. Will offend as many, if not
more, than it delights.
