The film centers on Ed Norton's character, the nameless Narrator. He
has a problem - he has insomnia. For six months he has been living his
life in a state of limbo; never quite asleep, never quite awake. In an
attempt to break this cycle he joins a self-help group for men with
testicular cancer, an affliction he himself is not blighted with.
Through this, and a myriad of other self-help groups, he is finally
able find a release for his emotions, and a cure for his insomnia. That
is until another faker, Marla Singer, shows up. He feels Marla's
presence reflects his own deception and pretty soon it's back to
sleepless nights. It is about this time that he meets Tyler Durden, a
charismatic soap salesman. They become good friends and start Fight
Club! As time goes on Jack feels more and more isolated from Tyler, who
seems to have his own sinister agenda. What is Tyler really up to? And
just what is Project Mayhem? The answers will have serious
repercussions for both Jack and Marla, as the film hurtles towards one
of the most unexpected cinematic twists since The Usual Suspects.<br /><br />I love this film and can't say enough good things about it. Perhaps
it's because the film struck a chord, or perhaps it's because there's
just so much content it's hard to get over.I notice something new and
interesting every time I watch it. I really can't recommend this film
highly enough! Also check out American Beauty and The Usuall Suspects!
