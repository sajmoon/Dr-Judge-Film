I do not understand why people seem to like this film.  To me, it really
just looks like a shallow whupass movie made for trendy fruits.  Most of it
focuses in illogical sex and violence which really don't seem to have much
of a purpose.  I'm glad this didn't sell too well here in the states; it's
good to know that most of America isn't like people in Hollywood.  Brad
Pitt, as usual, seems to just be reading off his lines and Ed Norton has
lost all the flame he had in American History X.  Just a pointless,
brainless mess of a movie.  One of the most overrated I have ever seen,
*ever*.
