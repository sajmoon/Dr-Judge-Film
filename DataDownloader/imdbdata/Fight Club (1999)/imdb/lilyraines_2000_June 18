If you have seen this movie only once, you must watch it again.  The
surprising twist at the end is more than enough reason to see it
twice.<br /><br />If you have never seen the movie or have only seen it once, don't read this
next part.<br /><br />Upon watching the movie a second time, I noticed very clearly the
subliminal
images interwoven throughout the movie to remind the viewer that they are
seeing things in flashback from the shattered mind of a man suffering from
the stress of everyday living exacerbated by out-of-control consumerism
intravenously fed to him on a daily basis.  These subliminal images take
the
plot to a completely new level, transforming the viewer's perception of the
events unfolding before them as if watching an entirely different movie for
the first time.<br /><br />This is a movie that makes you wonder if we are all a little &quot;nuts&quot; from
the
media perpetuating our unrealistic view of the &quot;ideal&quot; American from the
moment we were born.  Kudos to the director for capturing the subtle
details
of &quot;Jack's&quot; fragile state of mind from beginning to end without making it
campy, clinical, or forced.  This is one of my all-time favorites for its
subtlety, attention to detail, originality, and its thought provoking
nature.
