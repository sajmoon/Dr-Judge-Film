I&#x27;ve read few 1 star rated comments of FC and I got amazed how people
who dislike this movie enjoy trashing and insulting people that find it
masterpiece... I didn&#x27;t like it at all first time I&#x27;ve seen it and if I
knew about IMDb then, I&#x27;ll surely give it 2-3 stars. But when I&#x27;ve seen
it for the second time (even if I wasn&#x27;t keen of it, friend made me) &#x96;
all bits and pieces came in their places and I&#x27;ve realized that this is
the best movie ever made. Unlike most movies today, this one makes you
think. You may enjoy it without being anarchist, whore, drug addict,
uneducated, aggressive, neo Nazi and everything else that caring 1star
givers classified us. It&#x27;s their problem they want from movie to be
linear, classical thriller, to have logical plot, believable characters
etc. It&#x27;s their problem that only conclusion they can come up with is
that &#x22;this will make stupid people that are on the edge, to blow up
buildings and deliver pain&#x22; or &#x22;it portrays sadistic violence, anarchy
and terrorism in an appealing light and attempts to make it seem
intelligent; instead of what it is insanity&#x22;. If it isn&#x27;t sad, it would
be funny...<br /><br />People can&#x27;t make difference between satire and critics on the one side
and glorification on the other side... Fight club is wonderful and
poignant critics of the world today and 8.8 rating tells me that most
of the people got it right. For all the others &#x96; too bad for you that
you&#x27;re not able to see it&#x27;s excellence...
