When i saw the preview fight club i thought it would be arcaic
nonsense.
What it is, is one of the best movies i have ever seen. The number of
excellent memorable scenes is mind boggling. Norton thrust himself to the
top of the acting class. He is the best at making people know his
character
instead of knowing his acting quirks. Pitt does a fantastic job of ripping
through excellent dialouge and pacing the movie.It is about a man who is
living the typical life with a good job and a good apartment. He is in a
perpetual rut though of the monotony of his life and he can not sleep. The
only way for him to feel alive is to make bad choices and take pain and
suffering. That is where pitt comes in who sort of becomes is mentor. The
plot goes on from there then is flipped upside down. Youll have to watch
it
to know what im talking about.
