fight club, from the director of Se7en is an absolute classic for the
thinking audience. a movie that operates on many different levels will
appeal to all viewers primarily because of the &quot;twist&quot; at the end. however,
the brilliant dialogues in the movie, especially between the narrator and
tyler are cutting!!<br /><br /> this movie never meanders and stands up to repeated viewing, (i must know,
for i have seen it 23 times fully &amp; countless times in parts).<br /><br />brad pitt &amp; edward norton give off impeccable performances - but in terms of
sheer acting quality helena bonham carter steals the show. a movie that
fills me with life &amp; vigour everytime i see it. u might not enjoy it as
much - but definitely dont miss it.<br /><br /> a perfect 10.
