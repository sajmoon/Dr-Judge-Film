Fight Club is about an insomniac (Edward Norton) who is bored with life,
until he meets an interesting person who is the exact opposite of himself,
his name is Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Together they start a Fight Club where
guys just like them beat each other up for fun. Fight Club slowly turns into
project mayhem, basically anarchist, they blow up stuff and beat people up.
One of the most amazing movies of all time, Edward Norton is awesome, he
deserves awards, lots of awards. This movie is a great dark comedy, and is a
very good drama too. I didn't think movies could be this good, until I read
the book, it is TEN times better than the movie, it sounds hard to believe,
but it's true. Although the movie is a great interpretation of the book it
still doesn't even compare to it, everyone should see the movie and read the
book. 10/10 ....last
