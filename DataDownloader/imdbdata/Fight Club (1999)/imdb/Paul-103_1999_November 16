1999_November 16 

After reading through some of the reviews, it's obvious I'm in the severe
minority.  I waited for this movie.  I even looked forward to it.  I've
really liked Edward Norton's performances lately, but Brad has been missing
big time.  Since Kalifornia has been my favorite Brad movie so far, I was
hoping he would recapture some of the full characterization he gave in his
acting in that movie.  Alas, I still see no power in Brad's acting ability.
Edward Norton was good, but was limited by the character.  Didn't have as
much punch as I was hoping.  Kind of intriguing and kind of silly.  Not my
favorite movie of the year.
