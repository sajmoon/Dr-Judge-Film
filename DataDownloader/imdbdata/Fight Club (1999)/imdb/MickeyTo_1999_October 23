Rule number one about the Fight Club:  Do not talk about the fight club. 
Rule number two:  Do not talk about the fight club.  I am about to break two
important rules ... but only slightly.<br /><br />Director David Fincher crafts a complicated tale about a man suffering from
insomnia as he goes about his day-to-day life of earning a living, buying
IKEA brand furniture, flying from airport to airport and filing report after
report.  Jack (played by Edward Norton) is the everyday guy without a life. <br /><br />Jack discovers the wonderful world of support groups.  He does not have
testicular cancer, a problem with alcohol or a fatal disease, however, Jack
finds comfort in the confines of these clubs where he is allowed to
anonymously poor out his emotions.  He never uses the same name twice, and
his stories are whatever he wants them to be.  Through these encounters Jack
is suddenly able to sleep, and sleep he does.<br /><br />His make believe world is crushed when Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter)
starts to appear at the same clubs.  Like Jack, she is a 'tourist', sans the
alcohol dependency, the life threatening illness and testicular cancer.  (As
she claims, however, she, like the men in that room, doesn't have
testicles.)<br /><br />Marla is a trip in herself.  As though she has a death wish, she walks into
traffic and smokes like a fiend.  She goes to these support groups because
the coffee is free and it's cheaper than a movie.  Jack demands that they
attend separate sessions, and so they divide the group meetings between
them, vowing never to run into each other again.  <br /><br />Jack then meets his wildest trip yet.  Brad Pitt plays Tyler, a soap
salesman with a anarchist view on life.  When Jack's apartment is suddenly
bombed, he turns to Tyler for a place to stay.  <br /><br />As the two begin to bond, Tyler teaches Jack to unleash his primitive
instincts.  They fight.  And the fighting is brutal.  The pain received from
a blow is as much a rush as the thrill of punching the opponent.  The wounds
are battle scars, and they carry them with pride. This is the ultimate in
manhood, and .... sorry boys ... but a sexual rush as well!<br /><br />So begins a bizarre journey called the Fight Club.  At this point I will
heed the advice of rules number one and two and will say no more, except
that you have to see this film.  Once again, David Fincher has a masterpiece
on his hands, an intricate story complete with characters who live on the
edge, with morals that defy logic.  Slick photography, quick editing,
fast-paced narrative and brilliant writing make this film the acid-trip of
the year.  You don't know what is going to happen next.  You must simply sit
back and enjoy the ride.  <br /><br />Edward Norton is an ace at transforming himself into the character he plays.
 He IS the insomniac in search of a life.  Brad Pitt delivers his best
performance since 12 Monkeys.  Once again, he is a madman, however this time
he truly is dangerous.  And Helena Bonham Carter steps out of her corsets
and becomes the ultimate freak chick of the year.  <br /><br />I have not left a movie so exhilarated since Pulp Fiction.  The story moves
along quickly, taking odd turns and tangents, that often don't make sense,
but in the end tie together nicely.  The characters are all unique. 
Meatloaf plays a victim of testicular cancer, a former weight lifter, now
affected by hormones that cause him to have breasts.  He too is lured into
the Fight Club because he wants his manhood back.  <br /><br />This is action on the same level as any great Scorcese picture.  The story
weaves in and out of odd situations like a great John Irving novel.  I
almost passed on this film because I thought it was just another movie about
boxing.  Don't be fooled by the trailer.  Check this one out.  It's easily
one of the best films of the year!!
