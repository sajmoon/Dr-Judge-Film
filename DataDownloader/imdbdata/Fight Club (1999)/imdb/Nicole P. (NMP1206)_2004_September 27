Disgusting, Disturbing and Hard to watch at times. I love this movie.
It is a wonderful unique film, and in my top 10 of favorite films. Brad
Pitt is so incredibly hot in this film, I don't know where to begin. I
also loved Edward Norton in this film. He is a great promising actor
who has got a lot of talent. Like I said this film is disturbing at
times, but I have no problem with that, but other people might. A lot
of fighting, a lot of blood, but a lot of shirtless men at the same
time! Great plot with an excellent twist that I never saw coming. For
anyone who has never seen this film, go out and rent it, it is a must
see and a classic.<br /><br />10/10
