fight club is my favorite movie hands down. not only was the plot mind
blowingly true but every other aspect of the film was amazing.david fincher
has always done incredible work and this is his best yet i cant recall a
single thing that i didn't like about the movie less the fact that there
was
no samurai. although a samurai can make every movie better i think fight
club was great without one.
