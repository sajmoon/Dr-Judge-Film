1999_October 18 

This movie was fun and offbeat, until it turned very stupid.  I'm not sure
of the exact point, but it may have been when Brad Pitt, having just made
fun of muscle-torsoed yuppie gym fanatics, pulls off his shirt to reveal...
a muscled torsoe (oiled down, no less).  From then on, things got really
silly and implausible.  Unless you feel like wasting your money on another
Mall-ternative star vehicle, stay home and read a book.
