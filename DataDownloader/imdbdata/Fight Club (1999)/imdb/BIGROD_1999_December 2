1999_December 2 

I came into Fight Club thinking that violence was going to be the main
feature of this movie, but after I saw it I was pleasantly surprised that
it
was a film that really makes you think about a lot of the things going on
in
ones life.  I was thinking about this film for days after seeing it.  This
was spectacular writing and I am very interested in reading the book it
was
adapted from.<br /><br />Pitt and Norton impress me with every performance they have.  I respect
these two actors because they continue to take chances with all of the
roles
they choose.  Maybe the best part of the film might have been the first 15
minutes featuring Norton since I am sure there are many people in today's
work environment who feel the same.
