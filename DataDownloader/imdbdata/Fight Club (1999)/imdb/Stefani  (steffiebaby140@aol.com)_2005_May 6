I was skeptical about seeing this movie, wondering if it was going to
be merely a bunch of guys beating the crap out of each other. I was
pleasantly surprised to find that it spoke deeply about the human
psyche and the ease with which it can be manipulated. Fight Club was
enormously funny, but in a darker sort of way. Edward Norton and Brad
Pitt both do a fantastic job of setting the tone for the whole picture.
It has become one of my favorite movies, and that's saying something as
I'm not easily impressed!<br /><br />One tip however, do not try and take this movie entirely seriously. It
is meant to be a dark comedy and taking it seriously will only ruin it
for you. The most frightening part of this movie is that, ridiculous
though it seems, it is entirely plausible. The movie examines a
cult-like mind set, yet allows one to have a good time as well.
