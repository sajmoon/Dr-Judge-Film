1999_October 30 

I rank this film up there with a clockwork orange.  Both films try to show
the viewer a lesson by utilizing ultraviolence and surreal
situations/images.   A truly great film that will be remembered by future
generations and shall be seen as a meditation on what an individual
shouldn't base their life on.  Also the film has a great
twist.
