Despite the title, this movie is more about anarchy and nihilism than
actual fighting. After watching this movie, I too, was enlightened.
This movie has actual changed my life. They movie was excellently
written and presented. This is by far David Fincher&#x27;s best worker. The
acting done by Brad Pitt was excellent. After watching this movie, I
had to read the book it was based on written by Chuck Palanhiuk. The
book was far more interesting than the movie. I also noticed they
changed a lot of the book in the movie like the ending. I personally
preferred the books ending. I would recommend watching this movie and
reading this book because both will blast your mind.
