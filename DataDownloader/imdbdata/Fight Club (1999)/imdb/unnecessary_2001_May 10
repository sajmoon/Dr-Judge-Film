brad pitt was unbelievable. edward norton has never been bad and this is
no
exception. nearly as good a performance as in primal fear. the end has no
equal and is second to none. it is just unbelievable in general. it
criticizes our lives in such a true manner you cant fight back. it has
more
wisdom and wit than senseless violence, it has a message. (and a little
senseless violence for you action lovers) i highly recommend watching this
without a big crowd around you. you have to pay very close attention to
this
one. there are subtle little bonuses that are hard to pick up. this is a
great movie and i hope you watch and enjoy.
