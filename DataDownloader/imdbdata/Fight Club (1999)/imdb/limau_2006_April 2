I find this film hard to watch, not because of the violence, but rather
I don&#39;t really care about the characters to want to keep my eyes on the
screen and found myself looking at something else more interesting half
the time. All I can think of when I do watch is - &quot;Why?&quot;.<br /><br />Of course it became clear why towards the end. And it is also clear to
me that the film relies on the boys&#39; fascination with violence to keep
the film going until the ending when you can see what is happening, at
which point it actually got quite thrilling. Otherwise there isn&#39;t
really anything that is very interesting, just a middle class boys&#39;
fantasy of a more exciting existence while living their own very
comfortable but dull lives. It&#39;s for boys who get stuck in this
contradictory existence - hating the good life they have, wanting to
destroy it but in truth will never give up their comfortable lifestyle.
It&#39;s as stupid and as childish as the insertion of naughty bits into
the film.<br /><br />It is for the ending that it got higher vote that it did, nothing much
else to recommend it otherwise.
