I am admiddedly a fan of the film fight club, more so than many
people,
but not because of the cult status the film so abruptly gained, but
because
of the deep Nietzchian as well as Marxist philosophies that go into it, as
well as the historical contexts the film takes into account.  Not many
fans
of the film I doubt are aware of this, but the film's story is some what
unoriginal, this does not detract from the clever dialogue and directing,
but to state the film as being completely original is an emission of
ignorance.  Nietzche said in the very late 1800s and early 1900s that this
new middle class was going to get bored with prosperity.  That this
boredom
would eventually lead to a backlash against this new found consumerist
society. Something very much like this occurred in the beginning of World
War one.  Many young soldiers graduated highschool and put off college to
go
have a gun fight with the english, they were all slaughtered because of
their inexperience contrasting with the highly trained english commandos.
They wanted to &quot;Do Something Great With Their Lives&quot;.  The generations
before them participated in the franco-prussian wars and succeeded. This
generation did not have a great war, this generation did not have a great
depression.  Do you see where I am going here?  In the book, at the end of
Fight Club, the narrator goes into a mental institution, this is what
happened to Nietzche as well towards the tail end of his life, I have no
doubt this was a coincidence.
Now for the Marxism.  A good way to compare the story is to Animal
farm, or the Russian Revolution, Tyler Durden takes the role of the Stalin
Figure, the one who is more hands on and a bit more violent as well as
deceptive.  The narrator takes the role of a Lenin character.  Towards the
end of Tyler and the narrator's partnership, as with Stalin and Lenin,
stalin starts to push Lenin out of the picture.  The two like in history
also staged to take over Capitolism and create a new Eutopian society free
of consumerism and greed.  Of course as with history the antagonist's
personal ambitions overwhelmed the goals that were originally set forth.<br /><br />Back to the Nietzche for a minute, as for now that i have related to
two plot themes there is a bunch more of Nietzche that is in this story.
Nietzche was very sexist, not implying that the film is, because it is
not,
but Nietzche spoke heavily of men being emasculated by women as well as
the
&quot;super man&quot; which dealt with the concept of the ideal or the perfect man.
What was it, and why did men try to achieve it.  Fight club is very much
this, this theme overlaps with the idea of the consumerism but it is
important to single it out as well, being it why they are doing what they
do
in the first place.
This has no relevance to the philosophies but alot of people seemed
confused on the ending of the film.  I read in several articles that David
Fincher decided to make a silly Hollywood ending purposefully to be
satirical.  In that sense it bears alot of irony being that this is a big
budget hollywood film.  The ending of the novel would probably never be
appropriate to be viewed on the film screen, although it is far more dark
and sinister and would be amazing to see on the screen.  All i can say is
don't take the ending literally, it's a joke, you go to the movies, you
see
a movie, pretty much any film, and it ends on the upside, this was a film
about the downside, and how it keeps getting worse, and how things don't
always work out, by ending it like that, on the upside, surviving a
gunblast
to the face, Fincher is mocking the typical hollywood ending.  Why else
would they look out happily at the buildings falling and society being
plunged into another stoneage?
I hope i have offered a different view on this film, and those who are
into this film very much should get out some work by Nietzche and Marx
because they might really enjoy it, otherwise, have a good
day.<br /><br />
