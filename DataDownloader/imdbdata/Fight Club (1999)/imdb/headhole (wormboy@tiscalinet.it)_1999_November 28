1999_November 28 

the first thing that hits you about this movie is the visual impact...
there's a feeling of tension, of impending disaster that runs through the
firm camera movements... the grim atmospheare is reminiscent of that in
Se7en. but this is only the beginning. soon you begin to relate to some of
Norton's obsessions and fears... they get inside you until you ask
yourself:
&quot;would i go so far&quot;? this movie is almost a documentary of the modern day
man. i say man 'cause the film adopts a very male point of view, reason for
which it seems to appeal more to men than women. you come out of the cinema
with a sense of liberation, all kinda comes into perspective, you realize
that many things we are so attached to don't really mean so much. it's
obvious that the total spiritual anarchy that the characters adopt is not
the way to happiness, but it sure can help you get in touch with your real
self. some have criticized that the message could be destructive in the
wrong hands. i agree... it's easy for kids to be fascinated by the
superficial, and often dangerous, way of life led by the characters. as for
everything, it's down to the single person to interpret this movie with his
own guidelines. a great movie in my opinion, of rare sincerity.
