Actually...I may as well just state the obvious and say.<br /><br />This is the BEST film of ALL time. And I watch A LOT of
films!<br /><br />Brilliant plot, brilliant characters, brilliant actors....it's all
BRILLIANT!<br /><br />If you haven't seen this you are deprived but then again this film can
change how you view life.
