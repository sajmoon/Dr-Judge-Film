Fight Club is what it's all about. To make a film that sends out a message
that won't leave you alone if you are consumed by its brilliance. It's a
fact that this movie is the first of the 21st century, meaning that it's a
movie that gives you the truth.<br /><br />Why the hell does everybody complain about the violence. I bet if the movie
was called Chess club, and still contain the same content, it would have
been applauded. But I love every word that has anything to do with this
movie. The way it's displayed, the way the twist is presented to us, makes
this movie so incredibly genious! Brad Pitt plays an award winning role as
the counter part of a time bomb insomniac, portrayed by Edward
Norton.<br /><br />And they find a way to channel male aggression onto a form of therapy, in
the form of underground boxing clubs. This is a great image of us men,
'cause we are violent by nature. And I know the film would've had more
glowing critics if it had another name. But try to understand, this is how
we men can be. I identified like hell in this movie. Why do people like you
and me have to know what a duvet is? Is it REALLY essential to our survival?
NO, what are we then?  ....That's right. It couldn't be said
better.<br /><br />The most insane thing I've heard is that people call it fascist and
dangerous. If there are people that actually get inspired by the fighting in
this film, then Chuck Pahlaniuk has made a point, and I don't cheer about
it. But if others get provoked by the idea behind Norton's character praying
for a different life, than I respect you. Jesus, all of you who do not
understand this, what is the problem? Are you happy living your life?
Wouldn't you feel free if you had the ability to let that which does matter,
truly slide? I know I would. In fact I think I will give up my condo life
and stop polishing my scandinavian furnicure. I lived my entire life with
IKEA. And I don't feel enlightened, I don't feel that my kitchen set defines
me as a person.<br /><br />I won't spend more time tryin' to reform you who don't love this movie. I
just want to stand in the line of those who understand this movie. Why don't
we all try to stop controlling everything and just let go? Because we've
tried everything except that, and I don't think we are that special, or
unique snowflakes for that matter.<br /><br />Rating : A punchline for excellence. That's how good.
