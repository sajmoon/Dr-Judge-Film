I just loved this movie! It scared the hell out of me. It haunted me for
several days, and I was actually afraid that what happened to the main
person really could happen to anyone, or even to me...  Movies that does
that to me, I can count on one hand. Easily 10/10. I just can't wait for it
to arrive on DVD.
