Based on the novel of Chuck Palahniuk Fight Club is with no doubt a
film that sets a huge bar for future films of the kind. Everything in
it just looks like poetry in motion.<br /><br />The direction of Mr.Fincher is at is finest (better than in Seven, as
if that was possible), to a fantastic photograph, great soundtrack and
finally an incredibly well written, honest, rude and brilliant script.<br /><br />The Acting: <br /><br />Edward Norton does basically two roles in one film; starts at a slow
pace, he remind me of a lost and broken soul until he let&#x27;s himself go
by the steps of Tyler Durden, without a doubt one of his best work.<br /><br />Helen Boham-Carter always does a good job, very secure with no flaws
and very credible.<br /><br />Finally, Mr.Pitt does an outstanding job as Tyler Durden, the bad ass
that everyone wants to look a like. Tyler&#x27;s lines are the best thing in
the whole movie and the way that Pitt puts his charm into tell it and
the way that he makes us fall in love for Tyler Durden no matter what
he says, no matter what he does is unique. Great work!<br /><br />This movie is passionate, wrong, serious but most of all REAL! Hands
down the best film of 1999.<br /><br />Fantastic work from everyone that was involved!<br /><br />My all time favorite 10/10
