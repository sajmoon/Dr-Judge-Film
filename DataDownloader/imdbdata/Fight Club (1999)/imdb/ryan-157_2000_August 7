This film is absolutely stunning. Words cannot describe how fantastic this
movie is. From the slightly strange beginnings, the subliminal messages
and
pictures to the stonking sound (on the DVD anyway) of the plane collision.
And oh my god, I don't think anyone in the world would guess that for a
twist at the end. Totally and utterly fantastic, possibly the best DVD
ever
made and quite simply one of the best movies of modern times. Do not miss
this, it is a definite must buy.
