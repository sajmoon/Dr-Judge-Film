probably the most misunderstood film of 1999. those who misunderstood it
said it was violence for violence's sake or that it was animalistic and
brutal without purpose...stuff like that. those people p*** me off. the
film
is actually very philosophical (though flawed) and lends itself to much
more
interpretation and analysis than any other
contemporary action film (with the matrix being the one exception).
stylistically it's a modern noir tale - shot almost entirely indoors or at
night, an underdeveloped look that deepens all the dark areas, the
voice-over narration, the beginning shows the end, and there's the femme
fatale. at the same time it doesn't work solely within the mores of film
noir. from the very beginning it differentiates itself with a very active
camera, visual effects and the like. what results is a fresh looking film
that may one day have a name like &quot;neo noir.&quot; a great soundtrack. pitt and
norton are really good and well cast for their parts. i loved this film
the
first couple times i saw it, but i don't think it stands the test of time
as
well as i originally thought. seven and the game (also from fincher) are
more likely to hold up to repeated viewings. seven is filmed just as well,
if not better, and the game is a bit more solidly grounded
philosophically...but that's primarily because its philosophy is vastly
more
simple. fight club is more ambitious and, i suppose, should get points for
that. at any rate, fight club will stand up against the &quot;american beauty&quot;s
and &quot;matrix&quot;s of its time. all those films, at their core, fundamentally
question our lives and contemporary society, much as douglas sirk and
rainer
fassbinder did in their time. A--.
