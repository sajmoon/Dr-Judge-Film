Firstly, this film is not like you might think it is; it's not irreverently
violent, it's not mindless entertainment, and it's not a film in which Brad
Pitt gets his pretty face re-arranged!<br /><br />It is however a well written, depressingly claustrophobic, finely acted and
funny film, that has a delicious and unpredictable plot twist (for those who
didn't know). Me saying that this film is &quot;depressingly claustrophobic&quot; is
not to put it down, as I am so tired of films that do not draw you in or
engage you in any way. Just moving wall paper. This film is probably quite
different to most films you will have seen, so I can not insist strongly
enough that whoever you are you see this movie, for an experience that may
change your perspective on films if it doesn't alter what you expect from
films.<br /><br />SEE IT! (now) it's more fun than most of the other c**p you'll find in your
video store at least!
