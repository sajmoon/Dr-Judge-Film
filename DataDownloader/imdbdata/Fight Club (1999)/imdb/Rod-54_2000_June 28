  I saw this first on video, quite a long time after its release, though I
had been intrigued at the time by early favourable reviews suggesting a deep
and interesting message.  It is surprisingly in the art-house genre, dark
both visually and philisophically and quite disturbing.  The visual darkness
is obviously needed since much of the film is about an insomniac's often
distorted recollections of his nocturnal activities.  The performances and
the effects are strong.  My difficulty is with the message.  If, as the lead
character asserts, people in general will go a long way to avoid a fight,
why are so many men attracted to the fight clubs?  I had anticipated a
message of the type that the modern world comprises a computer industry and
many services industries and so it is a world for nerds and women, leaving
little role for traditional male stereotypes.  Instead, the film portrays no
contrasts of this type.  The men appear to be escaping from hum drum lives
or some kind of shared fear.  The only woman, whose contribution to the plot
left me in the dark, is certainly not a stereotypical service worker.  When
the revolution came I was confused as to what it was all about.  Was it, for
the men involved, nothing more than &quot;something more exciting to do&quot;?  I
would have liked a clearer statement, even if it would have attracted more
controversy.
