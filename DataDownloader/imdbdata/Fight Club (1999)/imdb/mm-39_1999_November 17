Great Movie.  When I entered the movie  theater I did not know what to
expect.
This movie is very anti  pc (political correctness), the director sets
the
mode that many people can relate to. (the lead actors plight).  A
repressed
person who lives with a very repressed job, everything about his job is
very
sterile.  He has to be very organized, careful what he says, and follows
what society and corporate cultures tells him.  As how one should think,
and
what is considerd sucessful.   Fight club evolves from this foray as and
escape from societies pressures.  A sort of mid-evil escape where prime
evil
urges can be played out. fight club it self grows from this environment.
The movie very carfully and slight of hand show this message about society
and the presure it builds on people.
