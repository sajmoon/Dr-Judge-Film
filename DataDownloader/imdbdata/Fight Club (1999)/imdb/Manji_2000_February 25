2000_February 25 

From the title, I'm sure many believed I would discuss how the film &quot;Fight
Club&quot; was a blatant display of contemporary fascism, but that's not what I
think. Beyond the violence, the big names, the media attention, I saw a
message and not just a film. Almost like the child-genius in &quot;Magnolia&quot;
telling his father that he needs to be treated better, I saw &quot;Fight Club&quot;
tell me I need to re-evaluate what is important in my life. This is not to
say that the film has changed me in some grande way, sure I did change,
but
ever so slightly. After &quot;Fight Club&quot; the purpose of film changed, that's
minute in comparison to the great picture that is life. It's my humble
opinion that a film like &quot;Fight Club&quot; was totally misunderstood.<br /><br />Unlike many who saw the film, I left the theatre fearing physical pain. I
now shudder whenever I hear a friend mutter that he wants to &quot;beat the
hell&quot;
out of someone. It's scary that a strip of celluloid was able to do that
to
me, rather than further desensitize me towards violence, the film has
caused
me to avoid confrontation. I think that's wonderful, but a lot of people
do
not. A lot of people are disgusted by the film, simply because of it's
vastly horrific violence. But truth be told the film does not even have as
much attack on the human body as I was expecting. So what made it appeal
to
me, a &quot;modern teenager&quot;?<br /><br />It was the director, David (&quot;Se7en&quot;, &quot;The Game&quot;) Fincher. He's a
visionary,
I see him as one of the few young talents in Hollywood that actually have
some sort of feel for what the camera is allowed to see. His directing is
fresh, dark, gritty and especially URBAN. Through his previous works we
have
seen at least two sides of the class spectrum which have always shown some
darker side of man. In &quot;Se7en&quot;, we witnessed the absolute hell that could
befall a pair of civil servants, two officers of the law and though it was
not a major display in the film, there had to be a point in the main
characters' lives when they had to come to grips with what and who they
were
dealing with. Needless to say, there is a sad ending and a great tragedy.
Meanwhile, in &quot;The Game&quot;, more than a year later we are treated to the
darker side of the rich socialite, and we are treated to a happy ending.
But
in &quot;Fight Club&quot;, there was no happy or sad ending.<br /><br />There was loss and there was gain whether it was wanted or not. And amidst
this, Fincher was able to take that whole idea of &quot;funky&quot; and &quot;digital&quot; to
it's darkest, while he erased the classes which were present and highly
focal in his other films. Indeed this is true as we see the various faces
and races which the actual &quot;Fight Club&quot; incorporates, mixed together
trying
to release some aggression. And things do get over the edge, but there is
a
sense of loyalty borne between the men who dare to journey into the darker
side of himself. &quot;Fight Club&quot; to the characters in the film was
practically
religion and a new way to live. They were better than most people in the
real world, because they did not live for the material items, they were
actually able to live for life. That means that they were living for
something that material items and cool gadgets could not buy. Would it
eventually lead to mass murder? Perhaps, but I think they would have
gotten
bored with it by the time it got that out of hand. I believe that much is
true because, regardless of the new found strength they were given by
&quot;Tyler
Durden&quot;, they were still products of the Generation X. Basically they have
all inherited some short attention span. It was a fad, nothing lasts
forever
in this day and age. Besides which, &quot;Fight Club&quot; would have eventually
become commercialized.<br /><br />Big industry is always looking for the next big craze, and I don't think
that the members of &quot;Fight Club&quot; would support something that could be
commercialized. Once you commercialize it it becomes an easy target for
merchandising, then they would be back at square one. But they can always
live in the now and know that they were doing something different, doing
something real, and doing something beyond therapy to help improve
themselves.<br /><br />So I say to Fincher, and Palahniuk (for his original novel), and Uhls (for
the adaptation to the screen), and Norton, and Pitt, and everybody who
helped to make such a great film, and of course the Dust Brothers for an
absolutely seamless soundtrack; Thank You! You have actually accomplished
making a film that has actually entertained me beyond the visual and story
and was successfully made in the 90's. Don't get me wrong, there are a
vast
number of incredible films made in the 90's such as &quot;Usual Suspects&quot;,
&quot;Philadelphia&quot;, and &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, but &quot;Fight Club&quot; was directed towards
me, and that felt good, I felt appreciated. I could identify with the
struggles like no other film before it, that just makes me feel great. I
think it was misunderstood, maybe I'm right or maybe I'm wrong, but that
still doesn't mean that it was a bad film. To conclude I would just like
to
say that I wish to read the original novel by Chuck Palahniuk, but half
the
adventure is actually finding a copy which I have unsuccessfully
accomplished. It's a rare book, so there must be a good reason for it's
popularity.
