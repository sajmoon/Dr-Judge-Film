Fight Club is definitely something different. It's not the type of movie
you
can decide if you want to see it or not based on other people's reviews.
In
my opinion, Fight Club is the best movie off all time because of it's
message. The reason that people bash it or call it a facist film is
because
it really struck a nerve and the only way those people can comprehend
Fight
Club is to speak negative about it. If you're reading my comment, just do
this. I recommend you see the movie, and decide for yourself. You have to
see it at least twice before you can really judge it. Trust me, you'll
think
it's different.
