Well, you need to cover the anger-market, so you do a supossedly
Politically
Incorrect movie full of empty and flashy FX with a lot of unnecesary
violence and an ilogical twist at the end and walla!!, you have all that
young people (and I'm 25) that wants to feel intelligent in your hand.
Fincher has done this before, in the fascist &quot;Seven&quot;.  &quot;Memento&quot; is not
fascist, and is more intelligent, but uses the same trick.  Ok, people,
c'mon, we can do better than this.  Do you liked the intelligent subtetly
of
&quot;Sixth Sense&quot; and/or &quot;Unbreakable&quot;? (the real minority movies that only a
bunch of people liked because they asked for your brain).  Do you watch
non-USA films? (I don't think so, and I'm NOT speaking about the Hollywood
Foreign Film fodder for americans like &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot;).  I'm tired of
posting negative anti-comments reviews, but unfortunately there is only
one
IMDB, and I'm trying to do a little bit of film education here.  I
promisse
to write about the movies that I like (the ones that generally have only
five comments -or none- in their page).
