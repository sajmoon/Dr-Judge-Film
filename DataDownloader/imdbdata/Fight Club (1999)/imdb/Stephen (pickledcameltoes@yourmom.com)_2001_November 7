I figured this was going to be like a Bruce Lee film, just street
fighting style.  This is actually unfair to say because I've never seen
a Bruce Lee film.  Anyway, this movie actually turned out to be
heavy intelligent material with twists not obvious to the whole
world.  I was most impressed that the plot actually had a good
reason to base itself around a club in which men just beat each
other senseless.  I never would have thought of a legitimate plot
that could have the basic guidelines of the movie portrayed in the
previews.
