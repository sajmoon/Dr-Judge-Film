'one of the most disturbing films ever' according to critics. 'This film
will do harm to young people'. People who believe these quotes are the
right
indication of this movie, are wrong. This film isn't about fighting or
violence, it's about a clever man, who thinks he's getting better, but is
really getting worse...<br /><br />Director David Fincher, creator of films such as 'Alien3', 'Seven' and most
recently 'The Game' has come with a new shocking film, 'Fight Club'...A
film
with great acting(never seen Brad so good), brilliant story(as good as 'The
Usual Suspects'), superb soundtrack(Dust-brothers ultimate skills) and even
a taste of history...<br /><br />Digging deep in the roots of history, you can see the similaritys between
Fight Club and historical events. The force of the national
socialism(Project Mayhem), people being very sick and think they are
healthy(Hitler) and all other kinds.........<br /><br />This darkned and very rare Piece of Art is one of a kind. It's
unbelieveable
how they can make movies like this one. This is as good as it get's
people.<br /><br />You must see this film!!!!
