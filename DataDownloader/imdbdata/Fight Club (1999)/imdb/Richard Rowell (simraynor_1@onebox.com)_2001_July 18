This movie has great suspense. Great special effects. It is a great new
original film that will leave you amazed at the end and give you a new
philosophy to the movie. You will feel amazement and confusion as it builds
to the climax of the movie. It gives you a new look at the life of a person
with to much routine and knowledge of an office job. Add a little insomnia
to the guy, and you will have your ideal crazy man. I can't say anything
else or it will blow the ending this is currently my favorite movie though.
Just think of it as &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and any action/terrorist film thrown
in the mix.
