I saw this movie with my girlfriend.  The two of us were so blown away we
saw it again with a bunch of friends two days later.  We probably would have
kept going again and again if we had the chance.<br /><br />Ed Norton puts in another great performance.  His ability to transform
himself (from the Primal Fear to Everyone Says I Love to American History X
to this) amazes me.<br /><br />And Brad Pitt was great.  Since 12 monkeys and Seven I have
liked everything he has done.<br /><br />The writing and delivery were great.  I went out and bought the book
afterwards and for the first time I can remember liked the movie better then
the book.<br /><br />
