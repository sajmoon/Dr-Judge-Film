2002_August 8 

It's Summer 2002 and I just saw this film a few days ago.<br /><br />I understand that quite a few heated exchanges have taken place over this
film, so I'll take advantage of the fact that the initial strong breezes
have finally blown over.<br /><br />I'll tell you what I like most about &quot;Fight Club&quot;:  it can be read in more
than one way.  That makes &quot;Fight Club&quot; rare, but not as unique as some of
its more devout followers may claim.  But for a couple hours, I enjoyed
being able to draw my own conclusions, comparing what I saw on the screen
to
my own existing opinions.  I can't say that my opinions have changed much
since, but the fact that I was forced to examine them felt good.  And I
didn't feel insulted at all by the filmmakers' take on the novel.  A
less-talented director, such as David Lynch, might turn this project into
a
hateful, monotone soapbox movie that hammers you over the head with its
cliched anti-establishment message (I know many of you may be Lynch fans.
People, listen:  David Lynch is not a genius.  He is a subpar director.
He
is the liberal version of Michael Bay -- an ego-driven jerk.  Don't
encourage either of them).  David Fincher and Company know better, and
they
treat the viewer as a human being.  After all is said and done, this film
really is about Humanity and the worth of a Person.  Don't trust me?
Watch
Tyler Durden's dehumanizing rhetoric get slowly dissected and exposed for
what it is.  Follow the evolution of Marla, from unwanted whore to desired
love interest.  Despite all the postmodern MTV-style direction, there's a
credible warmth to this movie that Lynch (or Bay) could never
muster.<br /><br />If we can step back from all the dust kicked up by &quot;Fight Club&quot;, we
eventually notice, &quot;Hey!!!  This is a MODERATE film!!!&quot;  I know that many
people don't WANT this to be a moderate film.  They want something to
justify their anger and hatred.  &quot;Fight Club&quot; is about what happens when
hatred and hostility overcome people at the extremes.  It's a Warning
Against Extremism.<br /><br />We know from the beginning that &quot;Jack's&quot; life as a worker bee in a hostile
Capitalist world is not something to be admired.  Extreme Capitalism is
what
happens when Love of Money replaces Love of Humanity.  The result is Enron
and WorldCom:  Evil men conspiring to rob decent people.  It's
understandable that Jack hates his boss -- the guy's a hateful,
condescending jerk.  We all know people like that, but some of the more
ignorant viewers of &quot;Fight Club&quot; will use such examples as evidence that
&quot;Capitalism has failed!&quot; while on their way to Capitalist Best Buy to
purchase the Capitalist Special Edition DVD of this movie distributed by
Capitalist (and Conservative) 20th Century Fox with their Capitalist money
so they can watch it on their Capitalist home theatre system that their
Capitalist Daddy bought for them.  Hypocrites, hypocrites, hypocrites.
There's a special place in hell for you.  For such people, &quot;Fight Club&quot;
will
never be more than an escapist fantasy, where they can feel like rebels
while being the exact opposite.  Do I think Capitalism is a 100% success?
No.  But is Capitalism the Great Satan?  Not hardly.  Capitalism is just
one
way of doing things, and it has worked better than its critics want to
admit.<br /><br />The other Extreme is Communism, which is what Durden's aim turns out to
be.
I don't think Communism is all bad either, at least in principle (everyone
of equal worth, etc.), but anyone who says Communism is a perfect antidote
to our few problems is obviously someone who has smoked a lotta weed and
not
paid attention in history class.  I hope and pray that there are not too
many impressionable young twits out there giving serious thought to
Tyler-Durdenism.  If I take issue with anything in &quot;Fight Club&quot;, it's that
it goes too far in glorifying Durden's hateful rhetoric, and spends too
little time countering it with the real message.  Durden is no better than
Jack's Boss.  Both of them are misogynistic jerks who reduce their
followers
to non-humans.  They step on the shoulders of their &quot;lessers&quot; -- in the
Boss's case, to maintain a higher-level position.  But Tyler's case is ten
times as hypocritical and destructive:  He wants to become a &quot;rebel&quot;
superstar while he brainwashes his minions into skinhead nothings who
exist
to do his &quot;dirty work&quot;.  His manifesto does not give men their manhood, it
takes it AWAY and makes them less than they were.  &quot;We are God's unwanted
children,&quot; he says, not sincerely including himself.  &quot;Durdenism&quot; robs men
of their agency.<br /><br />&quot;Fight Club&quot; is a cautionary tale about what happens when men hate each
other.  It's about the hostility that extremists breed.  The worst
disasters
happen when extremists refuse to compromise or allow others' opinions to
exist.  You have to understand, &quot;Fight Club&quot; could never get made in an
extremist environment.  Right-wing Nazis would gas you for it, and
Left-wing
Stalinists would make you &quot;disappear&quot;.  You could read &quot;Fight Club&quot; as an
extremist piece of filmmaking, but I believe its ultimate message is that
we
need to respect one another's agency and humanity, and not try to belittle
each other, either through punch-cards at the office or punches thrown in
the ring.
