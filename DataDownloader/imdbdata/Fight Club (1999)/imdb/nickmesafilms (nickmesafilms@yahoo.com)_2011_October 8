Director David Fincher brings a movie that is high-packed, and it takes
cinema to a higher level. The story follows Edward Norton, who meets up
with Brad Pitt, who shows him that fighting can help you escape fear
and become free, so they set up a fight club, which eventually turns
into a controversial cult. Let me just say that this movie literally
messed with my brain, which was awesome. Some moments made you laugh,
some moments shocked you, but they always keep you by surprise.
Director David Fincher really brought a dark tone to this movie, and
does an excellent job of thrilling the audience at the right moment.
Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter bring the best
performances I have ever seen in cinema, and they brought total realism
and surprise into their characters. The stellar script is well-written,
the cinematography is gorgeous, the editing is perfect, the soundtrack
is deserving, the sound is crystal, and the finale is one of the most
shocking endings I have seen in a long time. &#x22;Fight Club&#x22; is dazzling
entertainment, and it&#x27;s stellar perfect. I was focused on everything,
and it want me waiting for more. This movie is one of the best movies
of all time, and this is a perfect recommendation to the people who
loves violence. &#x22;Fight Club&#x22;, in my review, &#x22;a non-stop killer movie,
with a dynamite conclusion&#x22;.
