Fight Club is one of my most favourite movies! I have seen a large
number of movies over the years, and coming across something like Fight
Club is a rarity!<br /><br />Right from the opening credits, you know that this is going to be a
different trip altogether! Check out the fantastic dark mood, the
fabulous narration of Ed Norton and the similes he uses, the overall
pessimistic attitude followed throughout the story, a wonderful
screenplay, clubbed with mindblowing performances and a superb
soundtrack!<br /><br />Trust me when I say this; you may have seen a million movies but
nothing quite like this. They don't make something like this very
often.<br /><br />A gem in every way.<br /><br />Thank you, David Fincher.
