I was ready to call this the best movie of 1999, until the last 20 minutes
or so of it. Boy, does it fall apart. However, it is still better than 99
percent of the crap that comes out of Hollywood. Norton and Pitt are
amazing, and the direction of Fincher is visually dazzling. See it and
remember not to let the last bit taint the preceding brilliance.
