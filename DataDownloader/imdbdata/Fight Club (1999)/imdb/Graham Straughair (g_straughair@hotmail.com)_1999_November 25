1999_November 25 

Brilliant. Entertaining. Funny. Witty. Exciting.
Can you see where I'm going with this?? This film is one of the few that I
would class as having a bit of everything thrown in, most in large
quantities.
Maybe Hollywood is beginning to realise that the public wants something
different, this year would certainly suggest that with films like South
Park, The Blair Witch Project and The Fight Club.
Anyway, back to the film.<br /><br />Fight Club is about the life of an everyday man in the good old US of A. He
has a fairly typical job, investigating why cars blow up, burn. That sort of
thing. But he can't sleep and has very bad insomnia. He goes to counselling
groups to realise something inside and get some well deserved nap time. This
makes him content and he plods along for a while longer.
On a chance meeting on a plane he meets a man who is the exact opposite to
him in so many ways, the fun begins.<br /><br />After his apartment blows up they set up a fight club as a way of releasing
their inner angers at the corporate world that they have become slaves to.
But as with all good things, they snowball and carry on esculating in size
an effect. Then from one fight club springs up a mini-malitia group raging
war on the ways of the nineties.<br /><br />From this point on you can't say to much without ruining the film for those
that havn't seen it. But it has a wicked twist that doesn't annoy you and
kind of fits tot he scheme of the film.<br /><br />This is a great original piece of film making. You are forced into trying to
out-think the director as you watch, you want to guess what will happen. You
think about what you'd do in that situation. The performances of everyone in
the film is perfect for their characters. It's a real pleasure to sit there
and watch. <br /><br />It obviously won't cater to all tastes. Don't go and see it if you don't
like to think about things as you go. You have to pay attention or you won't
get it.<br /><br />Definately in the top five films of the year. Go and see this
film.
