This movie changed my perspective on life for years, and I&#39;m only
starting to let go of its morals 7 years on. Serious. For seven years
i&#39;ve been trying to live with as fewer possessions as possible, and
every time I see a nice watch or a designer brand top that someone is
wearing, I remind myself how materialistic we all are.<br /><br />Sound manic? it probably does, but lets not forget how true this movie
is. All told with the most imaginative CG animations ever. Before I go
on, I am not a fan of Brad Pitt, nor am I a fan of David Fincher, or
indeed Edward Norton. Although I must say this is Edward Norton&#39;s
single best role ever. So I am commenting upon this movie from a
totally unbiased point of view.<br /><br />I could not believe how many people misunderstood this movie and missed
the underlying message. That said, it does take a few times to watch in
order to understand it. RATM would be proud.<br /><br />Nothing else to say, except this is my favourite movie to date. With so
many views and messages that are so true and correct, its uncanny. Not
to mention, the best choreographed and animated sequences in a movie,
ever. This is a movie that people love, hate or cant be bothered
understanding in which case I feel sorry for the latter.
