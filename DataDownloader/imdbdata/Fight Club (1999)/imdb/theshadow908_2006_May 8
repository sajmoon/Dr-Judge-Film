Fight Club tells the story of a boring man with a dull life who meets
an eccentric soap salesman named Tyler Durden. The two become friends,
and end up starting a &quot;fight club&quot;. A place where men can vent their
anger by beating the crap out of each other. As the movie moves on, the
fight club gets larger until it evolves into a terrorist organization,
and a shocking twist ending reveals that Tyler Durden is more than he
appears. Fight Club is a very interesting film. It&#39;s a film I recommend
seeing more than once to take it all in. I recall not liking it at
first, but when I saw it again, I took it for what it was. A brutally
violent and in your face drama/comedy that deals with many of life&#39;s
problems.<br /><br />The always amazing Edward Norton plays the nameless lead role in the
film with Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden. They both play their vastly
different roles well, and the relationship between them is more
believable than most movies about two friends. The writing and the
build up to the ending are crafted so well that you almost get drawn
right into the film. Fight Club is a dark and disturbing film that
requires a thinker to view it properly. Very good.<br /><br />8/10
