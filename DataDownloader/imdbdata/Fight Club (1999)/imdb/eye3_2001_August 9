Sorry, gang;  I'm giving this a thumbs down.  This pic has great
cinamatography and art direction but that only makes it a video, not a
movie.<br /><br />The director and writer had a few ideas for half a movie but couldn't think
of anything else while the bills piled up.  The first act was good enough
but would have been better if it had made up it's mind where it was going. 
Too many scenes which promised something proved to be red herrings while
others just plain dragged.  The last act summed up nothing which went on
before;  it also introduced character relationships and elements which
hadn't been seen earlier. Thus the story arc was a complete wreck.  On top
of all that, the whole movie runs some 30 to 40 minutes too long.  All of
which are the classic signs of poor direction and writing.  It brings to
mind the fiasco that was Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves
(1991).<br /><br />It started out as an off-beat buddy movie and ended as cheesy,
pyschodramatic wish-fulfillment shlock on a par with The Rocky Horror
Picture Show (1975) except with a bigger budget and no catchy songs.  It
calls out, `look at me!' but then says nothing else, hoping a fashionably
alienated, post-ironic attitude will make up the difference.  It never did
and never will.
