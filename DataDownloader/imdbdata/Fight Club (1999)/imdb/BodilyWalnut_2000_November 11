Probably the biggest slap in the face for the paid critics, and pat on the
back for the IMDB crowd.<br /><br />This is one film that I think has lost a lot of potential viewers through
mis-understanding. When I saw the trailers and posters for this film, I
thought it would be some kind of crass kung fu movie, so I avoided
it.
However, a friend saw the film and heavily reccomended that I see
it.
I caught the last play at the local cinema, sat on my own in the smallest
screen, and boy am I glad I did see it!<br /><br />Included in the DVD box set (R2) is a selection of quotes from well known
US
and UK newspapers, in every one the film is slagged off. Many of the
critics
have obviously not seen the film for what it is.
Now looking at the votes on IMDB, the film is in the top 50 films of all
time.
The film got No Oscars, no Globes, no industry awards. What does this tell
us?<br /><br />It may be a very long film, but after watching it for the 2nd time, you
begin to notice how extremely important each and every frame is to the
overall picture. Subtle hints and almost subliminal suggestions mount up
until the mind blowing conclusion.<br /><br />Insights in to the modern life leave you considering your own being,
disturbing scenes brand themselves into your permanent memory. The film
leaves you exhausted.<br /><br />I will never open an IKEA catalogue ever again...
