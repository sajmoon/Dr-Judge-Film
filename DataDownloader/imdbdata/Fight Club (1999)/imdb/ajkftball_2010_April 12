Hmmm.... Like I said in the summary. Hmmm.......<br /><br />The film revolves around two characters. One is nameless, sleepless,
and looking desperately for some way to turn his pathetic life upside
down. Too bad he&#x27;s afraid to. Or so we think. The other character is
rebel Mr. Tyler Durden. This dude has some serious leadership problems.
Everybody follows his word like little puppies while he makes them
clean his yard (if it can be called that considering him and the main
protagonist both live in a run-down, old shack), stand outside without
food or shelter for days, and lets them beat the crap out of each
other.<br /><br />But it&#x27;s all good fun, right? Wrong. Or at least I think so. Many
people think this movie is about men breaking free of the shackles of
society and living free. It certainly seems that way for the first half
or so. But then this movie becomes what it does best. Satire. In my
opinion, this movie satirizes the way us men think we even need to
break free. Do we? What happens if we do? Will we shave our heads, scar
our hands, live in communes like hippies, and threaten to rip a
person&#x27;s genitals off if they break the rules. That&#x27;s what our &#x22;heroes&#x22;
in this film do. I bunny eared the word heroes, for although they are
glorified in the film, there is always a sort of foreboding presence
suggesting that what they&#x27;re doing is wrong, stupid, and basically the
work of anarchists. A lot of people are anarchists. I think you might
be starting to see why this movie is talked about so much. There are
probably thousands of different theories on the controversial ending
alone (which I hated at first but grew to love within an hour of seeing
it). I wouldn&#x27;t even be surprised if somebody told me that there are
now cults out there based on this film. Peter Travers called this an
American classic. It certainly symbolizes the spirit of millions of
angst-ridden boys all around the US, for better or for worse. <br /><br />Now enough about that. Let&#x27;s talk about what made this film a popular
conversation piece, in the beginning. Brad Pitt. He gives one of the
best performances of his career in Fight Club. Everybody else delivers
decently enough, but he acts his character like nothing else this genre
has seen. Before you say that that is heavy praise..... Think for a
moment. What genre is this? Heck if I know. And I probably won&#x27;t know
for a long, long time. This might even be the start of a new genre that
infuses slight animation, 1/24th of a second frames, non-linear story
lines, characters addressing the audience, and a whole lot more all
together to create one of the coolest styles of movie-making I have
ever seen. <br /><br />In conclusion, the last sentence of my paragraph before this one should
be enough for you to see this film. The movie isn&#x27;t fascist. It doesn&#x27;t
promote terrorism. It satirizes it, ever so slightly. It&#x27;s another
great portrait of art that combines different genres into one. And this
one covers the sweat, blood, violence, lust, and angst that is built
into the cells and DNA of male society perfectly. It is one of the
great classics of the 1990s.
