Fight Club as a movie is a masterpiece. Wonderfully played : Brad Pitt is
perfect in that he plays an archetype, and that's exactly what he
represents, Edward Norton is, well is one the most competent actors alive,
you won't realize he plays and his play won't attract your attention and
that's exactly what his character is supposed to be.
Inspired by an excellent book from one of the most promising American
author
(Chuck Palahniuk), the film achieves what is almost never achieved in
books
adaptation : it respects its spirit, its complexity, and even makes
extensive use of the books strongest sentences. I loved the book, but I
find
the film even stronger. Note that the film has a different ending -more
delighting, but less inspiring than the one from the book (which is
definitely worth reading to).<br /><br />But there is much more to it : it is not only a masterpiece, it is an
experience, an opportunity to challenge your self, your life, and your
world.
Do yourself a favor : watch it -and put your mind to it.
