&quot;Fight Club &quot; is the current climax of the work of director David Fincher
(Alien 3, Seven, The Game), who is one of the best (if not THE best)
directors running around in Hollywood at the moments. <br /><br />Like all of his movies, Fight Club is a very dark and atmospheric movie,
containing lots and lots of black humour and quite explicit violence. The
plot, involving people setting up clubs were they can fight just to counter
boredom is original enough by itself, but it also contains several really
unexpected and shocking plot twists, much like in &quot;The Game&quot;, or &quot;the Sixth
Sense&quot;. What's even better, these twists are actually quite believable
compared to many other thrillers (for example, &quot;Along came a spider&quot;
contains some of the poorest plot twists ever). <br /><br />Is there anything wrong with Fight Club ? Frankly, no.  This is one of the
only two movies (Pulp Fiction is the other one) that I have given a perfect
score of 10/10. Must see ! <br /><br />**** out of **** stars<br /><br />
