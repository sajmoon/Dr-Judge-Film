The great acting of Pitt and Norton and the top-notch visual stylings
of director David Fincher cannot overcome the juvenile and absurd story of
FIGHT CLUB.  Fincher has remarked that his film is anti-violent, and there
is certainly some validity to that.  However, he seems to be having too
much
fun filming this overwrought film of two men trying to return to their
masculine roots by having a series of fistfights with neighboring men.
Some
of the first half is fairly interesting and definitely puts a spotlight on
the sadness of men who  find they may have lost an aspect of their soul.
However when the whole thing starts this cult-like following of
epic-proportions and an idiotic last 45 minutes keeps you scratching your
head, the film simply ends up being ridiculous.  Want to see director
Fincher really shine rent THE GAME with Michael Douglas or SEVEN with Pitt
and Morgan Freeman.  Also want to see this same story told much better rent
Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.
