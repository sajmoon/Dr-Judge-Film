The fact that so many people liked this movie disturbed me. Is violence
really the only way to escape societal constraints? Using consumerism as a
straw man, the movie says that all males are, inherently, prone to violence
and that society is denying them the right to exercise this innateness.
After glorifying violence for 2 1/2 hours, the filmmakers decide to say
&quot;but
really violence is not quite as good as we might have led you to believe.&quot;
Most males will come out of this movie saying &quot; cool man. we should start a
fight club so that we can be real men&quot; and that is irresponsible
filmmaking.<br /><br />
