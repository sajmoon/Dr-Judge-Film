I have seen Fight Club three times now, twice in my megaplex, and once in
the comfort of my home theater.  I have determined the following: If more
films like Fight Club were released, society would not be complaining about
uninspirational stories.<br /><br />Fight Club is a passionate film in every capacity.  The story is powerful,
with an energy that dares you to try to keep up with it.  It has believable
character development, which the actors easily bring to the screen, under
the brilliant direction of David Fincher.  The cinematography helped to add
a visual effect to complement and enhance the story, not upstage it. The
soundtrack, by the Dust Brothers, provided a electric mood that kept me on
the edge of my seat at all times, as if a climactic event could occur at any
moment.<br /><br />I was amazed at how well all of these elements came together to tell an
engaging story, depicting characters the audience could relate to, and
sympathize with.  Fight Club has charisma, you just want to watch
it.<br /><br />The underlying message of this film which I picked up on was that rebellion
can be a healthy thing, until taken to the extreme.<br /><br />Our hero is a character who feels emotionally detached from himself, and
from the society around him. He exists in a world where he speaks in a
corporate language that has no emotion or meaning, he works in a job that is
dehumanizing, and he has no meaningful relationships with anyone.
Eventually, his mind has no choice but to pull his body out of
it.<br /><br />He starts touring self help groups for people who are afflicted with
terminal illnesses.  He pretends to be dying(which he is - emotionally) so
he can express himself to people who will really listen to what he has to
say.  He is tired of talking to people who (instead of listen), wait for
their turn to speak.<br /><br />Then he meets Tyler Durden, and the movie takes a turn.  Now we have a
character who can relate to our Narrator, but more importantly, act as a
catalyst for his development.<br /><br />At this point, I urge you to see this movie.  To reveal anything about the
relationship between our two lead characters, and the nature of Fight Club,
would break the first rule of Fight Club, which is &quot;Do Not Talk About Fight
Club&quot;.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes to see innovative
storytelling.  This film is very entertaining, but can reward a viewer who
wants to dig deep into it.  There are camera styles that will dazzle your
eyes and ideas that will stimulate thought.  The special effects are
fantastic, the performances are uncanny and all these aspects combine to
create one of the best films of the year.<br /><br />
