1999_November 18 

Okay, I've seen this more than a few times and found time to read the book
as well.  It's really an amazing piece of work.  The pace keeps you
riveted
to the screen, the plot twist shakes you up and the music score enhances
the
overall feeling of the film.  I would have liked to see an expansion of
&quot;Jack&quot; after he realized what was happening to him,  the short clips gave
you a taste but it left me wanting more.  Edward Norton is so talented, I
loved his facial expressions, Helena Bonham Carter finally broke out of
that
porcelain doll stereotype and Brad Pitt, well, I've never seen anyone look
so good in a pink bathrobe.  Forget what Roger Ebert says about this film.
Go and see it for yourself and think about your own life.  Wouldn't it be
great to have that kind of freedom?
