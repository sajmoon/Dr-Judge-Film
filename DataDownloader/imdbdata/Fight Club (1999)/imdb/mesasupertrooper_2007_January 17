Fight club was an instant cult classic from the start and still is to
this day. Edward norton proves himself to be one of the freshest actors
of this century. Brad Pitt should easily be winning awards left and
right, or at least being nominated.<br /><br />Fight Club keeps you on edge no matter how many times you&#39;ve watched
it. With the directors touch of dark humor this move becomes better and
better each time you view it.<br /><br />Fight Club is among the list of Pitts&#39; greatest movies, including
Snatch, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Troy, and many more, an instant classic. I
highly suggest this movie.
