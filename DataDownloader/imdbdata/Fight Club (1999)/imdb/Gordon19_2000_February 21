&quot;Fight Club&quot; continues director David Fincher's streak of groundbreaking
films that he has created, following 95's &quot;Seven&quot;, and 97's &quot;The Game&quot;.
This
is probably his most riveting effort yet because he displays a vision
similar to the dark atmospheres of both &quot;Seven&quot; and &quot;The Game&quot;, but with a
nail-biting social commentary on what the male race in society hunger for
when they have nowhere else to turn. The Edward Norton character, I think,
most of us will be able to relate to, male or female. I, myself, have felt
seduced by consumerism much like Norton's character, and occasionally pray
for a way out, or an antidode of some sort. For Norton, the antidode is
Fight Club, which he creates, along with the help of the eccentric Tyler
Durden, played by Brad Pitt in his performance in years.<br /><br />Like Fincher's previous films, &quot;Fight Club&quot; will definately surprise you,
only this time it will do so on more than one occasion. The 'twist' ending
is one of the best ones in recent years, along with &quot;Arlington Road&quot;. It's
a
shame that this film didn't get recognized at the oscars, as much as it
should've. &quot;Fight Club&quot; is an apocalyptic masterpiece that should be
studied
and reknowned for years to come.
