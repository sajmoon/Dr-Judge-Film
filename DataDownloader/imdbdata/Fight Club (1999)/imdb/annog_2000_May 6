Fight club changed my life.<br /><br />The movie gave me with a glimmer of hope with respect to young men. After
viewing it, I realized someone else out there knows that the boys of North
America have allowed themselves to become second class citizens. Instead of
becoming men, valuing strength and independence, they instead opt for a few
shopping trinkets, seeing cowardice as political sophistication.
The support group was their father's generation. Their testicles removed,
they became clumsy and frightened women.<br /><br />Ed Norton's character is dead. He works, he buys, he cleans, he submits.
This is one extreme of male behavior.
He permits himself to be consumed by the &quot;single serving&quot;
world.
He does not acknowledge that he has choices beyond that which keep him
under
control.<br /><br />Brad Pitt's character is another extreme. He strikes back at a psychotic
world, with psychotic remedies. He will not be a slave.<br /><br />To me, the idea of fighting, represented the notion that there are far
worse
things in life than taking a punch in the face. The process of organizing
your life so that you will never experience danger, or a punch in the face,
virtually guarantees a living death.<br /><br />Therefore, when the members of Fight Club first took a beating it was
liberation. Although undesirable, the pain was a distant second to the
experience to that of life as a slave/ consumer zombie.<br /><br />No one comes out a clear winner in this film. Neither Jack's side, nor
Tyler's point of view seems to be a complete solution.<br /><br />I hope that young men will take this idea and build on
it.<br /><br />Be a little brave, you will have a better life.
