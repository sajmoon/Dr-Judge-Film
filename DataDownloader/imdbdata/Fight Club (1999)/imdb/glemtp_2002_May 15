I rented this and started watching it and stopped about an hour in
intending
to go back and finish it the next day.  I thought it was ok.  Then I saw
the
rest on HBO about a year later and really liked it but I feel like I
always
admired it in an intellectual, detached way.  I appreciate it but never
felt
caught up in it.<br /><br />P.S.  Does anyone really think this is the 34th best movie of all
time?!
