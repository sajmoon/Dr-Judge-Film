One of the reasons I like this movie so much is that so many people hate
it.
It was refreshing to find some of the most negative reviews packaged with
the DVD. It shows that the makers of this film KNEW it would be
misunderstood. The style is simply extraordinary. It is one of the most
visually pleasing films I have seen. Brad Pitt and Ed Norton deliver
stunning performances. This doesn't seem to be enough for some people,
however. They decide to judge it based on the ideas it puts forth. No one
ever said you had to agree with a movie to enjoy it. And I know many may
find this movie disagreeable.
