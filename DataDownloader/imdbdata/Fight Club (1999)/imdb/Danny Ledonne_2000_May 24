It's a youth film.  My parents didn't get it.  They accused it of
suggesting violence as a solution to life problems.  What can you say?
The
movie speaks to the generic generation, my generation.  Like Durden says,
&quot;we are a transitional generation, no cause or purpose.&quot;  How can the
muffed
old bags at the Academy possibly understand?  No one saw it in theaters
anyway.  No one, I say, except Fincher enthusiasts.<br /><br />Somehow, Fight Club had been hiding inside me for years, waiting to get
out.  I bought the soundtrack and listened to the last track, which is a
mix
of Tyler's more colorful advice.  That summed it up.  &quot;This is your life,
and it's ending on minute at a time.&quot;  I'm a carpe-diem athiest myself,
and
the notion that being a god for ten minutes in an arena beats out a
lifetime
of selling pens really resonated.  One can help but feel completely and
totally numbed after the Fight Club is over.<br /><br />Yes, technically outstanding, artistically superior.  I'd liken it to
the
Clockwork Orange of my time: misunderstood, undergrossed, overlooked.
It's
full of star power, and both Norton and Pitt turn out career-shining
performances, but the deeper secret to success is the fact that the film
reminds you you're watching it.  The use of Tyler's random appearances
early
in the film are brilliant, the time flashes, the freezes, the framed
narration, and especially the concept of film being rattled and offcenter
create a subversive atmosphere that directly attacks the
audience.<br /><br />The success of Fight Club relies on it's confrontational style.  The raw
and truthful gore, the in-your-face cinematography, the brash and outright
message. (the things you own end up owning you)<br /><br />A testament of the counterculture to come, Fincher weaves one of the
most
poigniant stories ever to cross American film.  It doesn't touch you, it
doesn't warm you, it grabs you and beats your face in, all the while
selling
you your own fat ass back.<br /><br />Tolka's advice: evacuate the parental units, then proceed to induct your
membership into the last club you'll ever need.
