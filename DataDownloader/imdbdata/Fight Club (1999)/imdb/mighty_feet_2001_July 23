Fight Club,a film about a fighting club,I thought.I started watching just
for something to do really, but after 5 minutes i was entranced by it, where
was it leading, how does it get to the point you first see in the beginning
from actual beginning of the Narrator's story.As nearly all of the outside
scenes are a night, it gives the whole film a kind of BladeRunner and Batman
style, where everything appears to be hostile and unfriendly.I've never
really thought that Brad Pitt was a great actor, but he fits his part very
well. The story seems as though it is going to be quite straight forward but
there are several twists which lead you to some strange truths about the
characters.Although the ending is slightly bizarre, the film is really
great.You probably need to watch it at least twice to get the whole story as
you only really see the truth at the end.
