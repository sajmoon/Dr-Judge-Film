I'm speaking to you who calls this movie thrash, and non meaningful. This
especially goes out to Michael Lindberg and with his comment...You got it
all wrong Mike.. Just read through your comment, and then my previous and
Mega-Mike's comments. And then I hope you will understand.<br /><br />Fight Club is the main reason to cut your hair short or trim fingernails.
Why not? This I ask you to look into...Are we really desired by God? Do we
really have to know what a duvet is, in the hunter-gatherer sense of word?
No.<br /><br />The so-called Academy Awards overlooked this film, and gave all its glory to
American Beauty, which in my opinion is just as dark and satiric as Fight
Club. And Brad Pitt's has his best perfomance, even better than 12 monkeys.
Edwrd has his second best, beaten by American History X. ..by a
nose.<br /><br />The awards Fight Club should've been NOMINATED to is : Best actor, Best
supporting actor(Pitt should've won too), Best actress, Best direction, Best
adapted screenplay,Best score.<br /><br />And a final answer to you who thinks Fight Club rivals or has adapted the
idea for the final twist..You are wrong. I can just say that Fight Club came
out first...so anyway you put it...Either way the end kicks ass. See the
damn movie.<br /><br />Be clever. It will work out for you.
