This film offers very little to the thinking man, it asks nothing that
hasn't already been asked, it portrays nothing that hasn't already been
imagined and provokes nothing that hasn't already been cogitated. It's
Jack's complete sense of the self-indulgence. That said, even the thinking
man enjoys a bit of self-indulgence. And this is the greatest and most
enjoyable example of a cognitive narcissism since Nietzsche. Mis-shapes,
mistakes, misfits. Fight Club is a black comedy, a social satire and a clear
statement appertaining to the pointlessness of your existence. So what if
nihilism suffers from the cognitivity paradox, Pyrrhonism doesn't! So
embrace epistemological scepticism, suspend judgement and allow Fight Club
to help you reach Ataraxia.<br /><br />This film is better than sex!!! Well that is unless you're
stupid.
