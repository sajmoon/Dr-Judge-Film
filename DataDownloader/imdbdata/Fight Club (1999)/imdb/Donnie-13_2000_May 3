When this movie came out at the theater I refused to see it. Although
Edward
Norton is by far my favorite actor I thought it looked like a typical movie
about underground fighting.<br /><br />Then when my sister rented this due to her fixation with Brad Pitt I
figured
it was my chance to finally see it, and I am so very glad I did. This movie
has now become my favorite movie. Edward Norton provides yet another great
performance in this movie. Brad Pitt and the rest of the cast do a pretty
good job acting as well. While this movie may seemed far fetched the way
people come to bash each others brains out, it really isn't, this part of
society is very real. I could go on and on about this movie but I will end
up giving something away so here is my last comment.<br /><br />At least check this movie out. Whether you like it or not, it will not be a
waste of your time.
