As a main character says &quot;This is your life, and it's ending one minute at
a
time.&quot;  That's how I felt for most of this film which essentially steals
its
premise from the 1987 film &quot;Angel Heart&quot;.  The performances of the lead
actors all top notch, but the execution of the story is almost painful to
watch.  Sure, there's plenty of commentary on our current socio/economic
state, but does that necessarily make it insightful or
brilliant?
If lots of bare knuckle fighting and bleeding really pops your cork, then
this is the film for you.  But if you're looking for a strong story with a
real hero, such as in the first 2 Rocky movies or Van Damme's Bloodsport
then keep on looking.
