While I sympathise with the IDEAS presented in the film, FIGHT CLUB as a
film is in 
danger of being just one more consumer item in a society driven by consumer 
 
madness... <br /><br />The Hippies lived this life in the sixties,(minus the fistfighting)the Punks
to a lesser 
extent in the seventies, and today....the few odd malcontents and
wanna-bes....
