Let me just start off by saying... you need to see this movie.
Everything about it is incredible. The way that Fincher directed it and
the way the sets looked and how the characters acted are exactly the
way I thought they would be in the book. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton
did an awesome job as the two main characters. In my opinion Norton
should have got the award for best actor. Helena also did a great
acting job in this film. I think you really see what she&#39;s capable of.<br /><br />This movie has a huge mostly underground fan base. I don&#39;t think it was
really advertised correctly. I think back and I don&#39;t remember ever
seeing trailers for this movie on TV or in the theaters. I also think
that people just watched it once and gave up on it. YOU NEED TO WATCH
THIS MOVIE MORE THAN ONCE IF YOU Didn&#39;t GET IT THE FIRST TIME! <br /><br />Anyways, this movie is awesome. My favorite of all time. It will also
throw you through, in my opinion, a twist better than The Sixth Sense
and Saw.<br /><br />_James Clancy
