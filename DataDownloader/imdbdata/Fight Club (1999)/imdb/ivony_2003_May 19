When Fight Club first came out, I had NO desire to see it...none.  After
seeing the previews, I mistakenly thought it was just another mindless
action flick with little plot and lots of fighting. Don't get me wrong,
those movies can have an appeal of their own, but isn't something I was on
the edge of my seat to see.  Well, we had company one night and they had
brought over Fight Club.  I felt almost obligated to watch it, so I did.  I
was elated to find I was completely wrong and had totally misjudged this
movie...it was awesome!<br /><br />Brad Pitt was fabulous in this movie as crazy, over the top, yet charismatic
Tyler Durden.  I haven't seen him perform this well since 12 Monkeys. 
Edward Norton, however, has always impressed me...even in movies I didn't
really care for.  That being said, it was no surprise to me that his role as
the bored, nameless Narrator was absolutely fantastic.  Edward Norton is
incredible...going from a man &quot;going through the motions&quot; of a typical
&quot;yuppy life&quot; to letting loose and ridding himself of the frustrations he
feels through his new found &quot;support group&quot;: Fight Club.<br /><br />Fight Club is an incredible journey into madness and destruction that draws
you into its clutches and doesn't let go until the very last scene.    And
Fight Club certainly isn't a &quot;mindless&quot; movie. <br /><br />Check this one out...it earns a SOLID 10 out of 10.
