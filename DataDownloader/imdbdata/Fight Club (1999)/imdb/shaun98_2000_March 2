2000_March 2 

It's been over two months since I went to see it, and my feelings towards
the film are still somewhat mixed. Part of me feels repelled by the graphic
violence (I winced several times), but another part wishes I'd directed it
myself.<br /><br />The film has been compared to &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. Granted, it's not quite
as good, but it sure sticks in your mind, I'll give it that. Certainly one
of the most daring movies ever made, FC never backs down or pulls any
punches, but constantly pushes the envelope. It's a love-it-or-hate-it
affair, but whatever your feelings, you can't deny the dazzling technical
skill displayed by David Fincher. The camerawork and editing is first rate,
although perhaps a bit too flashy at times.<br /><br />The acting is pretty damn good. Brad Pitt delivers his most memorable
performance (his best since &quot;12 Monkeys&quot;), and Edward Norton is simply
superb. He is one of the great actors of our time. Helena Bonham Carter also
comes off brilliantly. I found her both attractive and repulsive-a VERY
difficult balance to pull off.<br /><br />Once, I took a mass media class, and they showed this awful video showing
two crabby old men whining about how much violence there is in the media. I
can only imagine what they would say about FC, they would certainly seperate
content and context and miss the point entirely. It's very violent, yes, but
it's not there for it's own sake. It's a statement on alienation and
miscontent in today's society.
