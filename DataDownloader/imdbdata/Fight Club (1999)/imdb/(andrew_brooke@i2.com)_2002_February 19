When I first saw &quot;Fight Club&quot;,  had mixed feelings about it. I thought that
the &quot;twist&quot; in it was preposterous and unbelievable. But having watched the
DVD several times now, including all four commentary tracks, I now feel this
is one of the most brilliant films I have ever seen - indeed, many people
have called this &quot;the first film of the 21st century&quot;, and they are
right.<br /><br />You really do have to see this film several times, ideally on DVD with
headphones, to see and hear the many layers and hidden details throughout
the film. For example, just before Jack (the Narrator) confronts Marla in a
self-help group, you can clearly see a guy walking toward Marla, probably
hoping to pick her up, but he turns away as Jack approaches. Another
example: as the &quot;space monkeys&quot; go upstairs after being handed their
homework assignments, you can see Meatloaf in the background breathing from
an oxygen tank - apparently he was so hot in his body suit, he needed extra
air! In another scene, after the space monkeys threaten the commissioner and
are leaving the building, you can see Meatloaf pulling up his
pants!<br /><br />The visual effects in this film are spectacular and ground-breaking, but not
overdone. They add to the movie, but do not overwhelm it. Almost as amazing
as the visuals is the *sound*. Again, DVD with headphones is the best way to
pick up on this - the sounds are so real, I often found myself quickly
jerking away my headphones thinking that the sound (such as a dog barking or
glass breaking) had come from outside. It's no surprise that this film won
several awards for sound.<br /><br />This is one of the few films I've seen that made me want to read the book -
which I did in only one day. It's fascinating to see where the book and film
are similar, and where they diverge. In many respects, the film is actually
better than the book. Certain scenes are changed, often for the better. For
example, in the car crash scene, Jack is talking with a mechanic - in the
film, he talks with Tyler. In the book, it is Jack who confronts the
storekeeper, Raymond Hessel - in the film, it is Tyler. The endings are also
somewhat different, and I actually preferred the film's ending to the
book's.<br /><br />This is definitely not a film for everyone - it is violent, but is about so
much more than simply violence. Ultimately, Jack, by rejecting Tyler,
rejects violence, and I think this what the film is about - finding that
elusive middle ground between being a boring, office consumerized clone and
being totally out-of-control.
