I have heard people complain that this film is 'too violent' or 'too
focused
on blood and gore'. If you that, you have missed the entire point of this
great adaptation (the book is exquisite!). Its about self against self in
a
world devoid of utopian ideals and real reality. Id versus ego with love,
lust, blood and destruction mixed in! You need to view several times to
even
come close to grasping the scope of this film!
