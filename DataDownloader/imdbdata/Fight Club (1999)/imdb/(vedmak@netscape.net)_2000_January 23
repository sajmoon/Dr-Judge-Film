I was very impressed by this movie. It gave me a lot of thoughts to
cogitate. I think this movie is similar to Matrix, but not in plot but in
idea - we are all slaves of SYSTEM (or government,
or customs) in which we live. We are NOTHING to system, but it can not work
without us, so we have rights (and must have strength and will) to
overpower
system and make it work for OUR purposes.
This is how i understood the idea of the Fight Club.
I support idea, but i don't support methods of it realization.
So see it by yourself and make your own opinion about this movie (you
deserve it).
