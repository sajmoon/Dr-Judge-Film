This was the 2nd best movie of 1999. The first being The Matrix. But Fight
Club was great. It is about a man who is very very lonely and has no one
besides his job. Well after joining meetings and stuff for his insomnia, he
meets Tyler Durden, and his life changes from there on. He joins a national
wide club that Tyler started called Fight Club. The fight scenes are great
and the movie is great. And with the twist at the end, I am sure it will be
a movie you will love to.
9/10
Rated R for strong violence, language and some sexuality.
Also Recommended: Face/Off
