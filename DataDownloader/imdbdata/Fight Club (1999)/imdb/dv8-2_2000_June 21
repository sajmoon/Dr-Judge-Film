I'm so tired of reading posts by users saying that this movie is too
violent, too fascist, too nihilistic, too blah, blah, blah.  It is a
F**KING
BLACK COMEDY!.  Fincher, Pitt, Norton, and Carter have all been quoted as
saying this.  Saying this movie promotes fascism is like saying the movie
Heathers promotes shooting Christian Slater's middle finger
off.<br /><br />This is without a doubt one of the most original films to hit the screen
in
years.  If you're mad that Fight Club tells a story in a unique way go
rent
the Mighty Ducks 3 and shut up.<br /><br />The people that can handle this movie have hugged one too many trees and
can't except the fact that 1) most men have a violent nature and 2) Ikea
is
a false God.<br /><br />And for those of you that say you saw the ending coming -- YOU ARE
LYING!!!
There was nothing to tip you off to the twist until it happened.  If you
said that about the 6th Sense I would believe you, but with Fight Club no
way.
