i turn on my xbox at 230 in the morning to play a couple games of gears
of war, and this movie just started and playing, and within 1 minute
all i knew is that Edward Norton was hugging a man with bitch tits. i
instantly started the movie over from the beginning hoping to find some
explanation as to why this happened or what the hell this movie was. i
was introduced to fight club. a few minutes after the opening credits i
look at the clock and it was 5 am. as i picked my jaw off the floor and
changed my ruined underwear i realized that i must tell the world about
this film. unfortunelty it had been out for about 8 yrs but i didn&#x27;t
care. i showed probably 12 friends of mine and soon enough, you guessed
it our own fight club. this movie is amazing. great acting, funny,
memorable scenes. every line in this move can be quoted. a great plot
twist, and a the perfect ending credits song to wrap everything up.
this is a must watch
