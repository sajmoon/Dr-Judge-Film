<br /><br />That is totally thought provoking. I went into the movie with low
expectations since some critics destroyed it. I was totally surprised how
the movie became a great psychological thriller instead of &quot;an excess of
violence put out as art.&quot; If a certain blockbuster film-noir did not come
out before &quot;Fight Club&quot; this movie would be number 1 in the box office for
however many weeks. Norton and Pitt gave solid performances. Fincher is like
always-genius. No matter how much I wanted to get annoyed at Fincher's
camera angles I couldn't get enough of them.  So forget what those dense
critics thought about this movie. This isn't a Gen-X film; It's for all
people that need a break from their ambiguous life.
