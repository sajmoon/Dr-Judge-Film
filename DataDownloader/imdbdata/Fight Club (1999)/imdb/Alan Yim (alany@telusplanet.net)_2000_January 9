I talked to a close friend of mine recently about this movie and
he
indicated that I absolutely had to see it. At his urging, I saw this
movie
today and I'm still not quite sure what to say. I thought I was going to
see
a movie about fighting (which there was plenty of) but somewhere along
the
way, this movie took my brain and twisted it all up. Walking out of
the
theatre, I didn't know which way was up and everything around me seemed
so
surreal after this movie.<br /><br />For those of you who don't know what this movie is about, here is a
brief
summary...as best as I can describe. Even now, I still have a hard
time
trying to coherently describe the storyline. This was one of the very
few
movies that I could not tell where the story was heading so I don't want
to
ruin it for you by telling you too much. The Fight Club is told through
the
eyes of a young man (Edward Norton) who suffers from insomnia as well
as
hating everything about his life. He tries to find himself by
attending
different suppport/addiction meetings and discovers that he can let
himself
go and is able to open up and bond with strangers. Not too soon
afterwards
on a business trip, he meets a soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Brad
Pitt).
Through an unusual circumstance, Norton's character (who
incidentally
doesn't have a name) end up living together. As you quickly become aware
of,
Durden's character is almost the opposite of Norton's character.
Everything
that Norton's character wants to be Durden is and through this
unusual
friendship, the two create a secrete underground society called &quot;The
Fight
Club&quot;. This club's purpose is for men who are trapped in their
mundane
pointless lives to come together and release stress by fighting each
other.
The club has a very strict set of rules that create form and structure
for
the members yet at the sametime allow them to release their frustrations
and
aggression. Everything, in it's own twisted way, seems to be going fine
but
as the movie progresses, Norton's character realizes that things
(in
addition to Durden) are starting to get out of hand. He tries to
regain
control of the situation and realizes that things are not what they
seem.<br /><br />The two main actors in this movie (Norton and Pitt) are fantastic.
Edward
Norton's portrayal of an insecure, conservative young man is very well
done.
In fact you don't realize the how well a job he does until the end of
the
movie. Brad Pitt plays the neurotic character of Tyler Durden equally
well.
The chemistry between the two of them is very evident and definitely adds
to
the entertainment of this movie. The supporting actors turn in
good
performances as well but most of the focus is around Norton and
Pitt.<br /><br />The one thing that I can tell you about this movie is that there is a
lot
going on. Almost everything that happens is representative of something
so
when you watch this movie, make sure you pay attention. You may
not
understand everything at the time but it all becomes very clear at the
end.
But as I hinted at the beginning, it is a very cerebrally twisted movie.
It
definitely makes you think about what the human mind is capable of and
what
it isn't. The scary thing is that this movie points more towards what
the
mind is capable of doing than not doing.<br /><br />The movie is long but the ending is definitely worth it. Overall, I
would
recommend this movie to any adult. There is A LOT of graphic violence and
is
not for the faint of heart or the squeemish but if you can handle this
type
of thing then definitely go see it. You will enjoy it and even if you
don't,
the ending will make it worth your while.<br /><br />A<br /><br />
