This movie directed by David Fincher is a very black social satire. It is a
critic to society's emotionless, materialistic way of life. A society that
tells you to go to college, get married, have a house and a good job. This
movie is about how things you own end up owning you, and how one man wakes
up, is close to driving insane, and tries to work things out.<br /><br />The leading actor named Jack (Edward Norton) is suffering from insomnia,
his
life being at a stage where time stands still. To treat his illness he
starts joining support groups. He's recovering quickly - although his
actual
illness is not beeing treated at the support groups - until another
&quot;tourist&quot; showes up: Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter). They make a
compromise about who goes to which groups, knowing they're both just
looking
for the same answer in life.
But it turns out Jack has got no time thinking about his insomnia anyway,
because his apartement gets blown away and he meets Tyler Durden (Brad
Pitt). Tyler is a crazy guy full of life, power and energy - the opposite
of
Jack. The amazing differences build a bond between them and they start
&quot;fight club&quot;, a way to escape the weakness of society. It's a new form of
therapy and the concept is growing into the terrorist organisation &quot;project
mayhem&quot;.<br /><br />This movie is not about fighting and useless aggression, it's not about
men's
need for leadership. it's about fighting the insomnia of today's regular
life. It shows that the war of today is a spiritual war, because our
depression is our lives.
Waking up and opening our eyes is hard, and trying to fight the force of
our
society is dangerous: &quot;project mayhem&quot; is the extreme form of a change in
society, it's desperate solution.<br /><br />In a way, you can really compare the theme from &quot;fight club&quot; with &quot;american
beauty&quot;. They both show one person, struggling for a change after waking up
in a wrong, boring life, which is literally driving them insane.<br /><br />If you don't like &quot;fight club&quot; or you think this movie's violent, you're
probably closing your eyes from the truth. Because the truth is that this
movie showes how rough and wrong today's society is. It represents what a
lot of us think but don't dare to say - it's a warning, a wake up call.<br /><br />The title of the last song in the movie is a good reminder for us all:
&quot;Where is my mind&quot; from the Pixies.<br /><br />First rule of fight club is: Open your eyes!
