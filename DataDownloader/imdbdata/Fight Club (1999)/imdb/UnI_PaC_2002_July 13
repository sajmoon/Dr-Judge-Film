When I asked one of my friends to check this movie out... I had doubts. The
title of the movie led me to believe that it was going to be another
&quot;Rocky&quot;
flick with a ring and two guys fighting it out. (Or that I never really
paid
attention to the trailers... heh)<br /><br />But after I saw this movie, I was left in awe. It was powerful and moving.
I
don't think I have thought this much about a movie 5 hours after I've seen
it before.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, go pick it up cause it's worth 2 hours of your time
and 5 bucks outta your wallet. =)
