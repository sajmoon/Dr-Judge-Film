Fight Club is the most underrated film ever.  It's lack of critical acclaim,
box office success, awards and nominations astound me.  Perhaps because this
film dares to be different, and brave enough not to stick to the golden
rules of Hollywood film making.  <br /><br />Boasting brilliant performances from the two leads - as well as the rest of
the excellent cast - FC transports the viewer into a disturbing journey
through violence, insomnia, pain, relief, anarchy and alienation.  Which is
not to say that FC is without it's charm and humour.  <br /><br />David Fincher - who is only getting better in my opinion - steers this film
into his own cave of cinema brilliance, with inspired moments and dazzling
visual scenes.  He constructs visions of confusion, mania and realisation
with the ease of the film genius that is David Fincher. From the opening
credits this film had me.  I couldn't look away from the screen. <br /><br />This movie is THE best film to come out of 1999.  The fact that it got
ignored by the Academy Awards, the Golden Globes and other such awards fills
me with disgust.  A token Sound Effects Editing Oscar nomination proves that
Hollywood has no place for films that challenge our senses, which don't
treat the audience like three-year-olds and spoon-feed them plot lines.<br /><br />Edward Norton is still to get his credit for being one of the best actors in
movies today.  I hope that one day he gets the accolades he deserves.  Brad
Pitt is not just a pretty face either, and lately he has been showing how
good an actor he really is.  <br /><br />This timeless classic will only be appreciated by the few of us in the world
who recognise the brilliance in this film.  Until people are ready to open
their minds, FC will always be underrated.  This is an excellent
movie.
