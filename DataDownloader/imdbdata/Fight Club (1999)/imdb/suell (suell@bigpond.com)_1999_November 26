Just saw fight club, and hail to Brad!!!
His best film yet, for sure - by far!! The first film i actually thought
that finally - if, (and i  stress IF) anyone doubted his acting abilities
they would be hit hard in the face!
Have mercy on us brad, we're not worthy!!!!
He is THE man!  He can act, he can be cool and he can be sexy without even
trying.
Edward was brilliant, as always.  His acting was as good as his
performance
in Primal Fear.  This movie is not about fighting and violence, do not be
fooled.  It challenges the mind and left me thinking for endless hours
afterwards.  Go see it!!
