1999_October 27 

This film demands to be seen twice, and it is not for everyone.  If you saw
Double Jeopardy and marveled at the wit and intelligence of the screenplay
(SARCASM ALERT) then this film is not for you.<br /><br />Personally, I loved Fight Club and I thought it is the best film of the
year, so far.<br /><br />The plot, which can't be revealed in any great detail so as not to spoil
the
surprises of the movie, is basically about a character (referred to in the
credits as the Narrator) played by Edward Norton, who has had it with the
corporate Single Serving life and finds a new thing with Brad Pitt, who
plays Tyler Durden.<br /><br />This movie is violent, but not senselessly so.  Each scene has a point, or
as my drama teacher used to say, &quot;Each scene turns a corner.&quot;  The corners
this movie turns are pretty remarkable.  If this film doesn't have you
questioning your life, you must be extremely rich and successful.  For
those
of us who are not (99%), this is a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />This and Iron Giant give me hope abut Hollywood again.  And this year isn't
over yet...we still have The Messenger, Dogma, Being John Malkovich, The
Insider, Sleepy Hollow, The Green Mile, etc. to look forward to.<br /><br />YOU ARE NOT YOUR JOB.  YOU ARE NOT THE CONTENTS OF YOUR WALLET.  YOU ARE
NOT
YOUR F*****G KHAKIS.  YOU ARE NOT AN ORIGINAL AND UNIQUE
SNOWFLAKE.
