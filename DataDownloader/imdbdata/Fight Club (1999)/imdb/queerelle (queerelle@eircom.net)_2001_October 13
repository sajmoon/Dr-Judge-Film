I loved every minute of this movie. It was thought-provoking, dark,
atmospheric and subversive in a way only Fincher can achieve. The
performances were astounding, but not the best element of the film. There
is
no element of this film that outshines another. It is a well rounded piece
of art - the direction, acting, writing, cinematography, locations were
superb.
