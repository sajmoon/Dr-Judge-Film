This has to be one of the best movies ever made! Fight Club tells the
tale of an insomniac who is losing his grip on reality. Then, he meets
Tyler, and that is when all hell breaks out! The narration given by
Edward Norton is powerful and haunting, and it makes the suspense and
terror seem that more realistic. This is the kind of movie where you
cannot tell the story to others too much without giving the whole movie
away. The ending is one of the best I have ever seen in a movie since
Usual Suspects. This is a powerful movie which will make you believe
that chaos can end all existence. I think EVERYONE should see this
movie. It is gruesome and violent at times, but it&#39;s worth it! It&#39;s a
shame that I can only give it 5 stars. It really should be 100 stars,
or even more! Fight Club is without a doubt one of the best movies ever
made!
