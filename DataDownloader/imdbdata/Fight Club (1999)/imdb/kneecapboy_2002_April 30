This is an astounding achievement, not just for the awesome direction and
mindblowing script, but also for its comment on masculinity and society.
This is a film that picks up on the emptiness created by the world in which
we live (particularly for males) and rubs our faces in it. It is graphic
and
disturbing, offensive and wonderful - it cuts to the heart of consumerist
culture and the loneliness this culture creates.
