I rented this video a few weeks ago when I was unable to bring myself to
rent any more of the trash that had been in theaters last summer.  So I
wandered through the &quot;favorites&quot; section and came across Fight Club.  I had
been passing this one on the shelves for five years but decided tonight I'd
give it a try.<br /><br />In a word, WOW!<br /><br />I had expected a typical matter-of-fact movie about guys who like to fight
each other, a standard Hollywood plot twist or two and then the good guy
beats the bad guy in the big fight and rides off with the
quirky-but-adorable love interest in the end.  Boy was I
wrong.<br /><br />I did get the film about guys fighting, but there was also so much more. 
This film speaks on so many levels I'm still sorting it out weeks later.  It
has cutting social commentary on modern life, consumerism, good and evil,
the male psyche, philosophy, and of course, fighting.  The love interest was
definitely quirky but pretty darn far from adorable.  This is no Hollywood
picture.  The dialog pulls no punches, and there are plot twists sharp
enough to make you lose your lunch.  <br /><br />I watched this thing five times on five consecutive nights just trying to
take it all in.  You can watch it five times and see five different movies. 
It works as an action flick, a dark comedy, a twisted romance, an art film,
a mystery, and a satire.  If you haven't seen this picture I highly
recommend renting Fight Club.  You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />
