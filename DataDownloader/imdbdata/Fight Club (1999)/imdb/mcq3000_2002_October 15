I remember when I first watched the film, my brother recommended it. As I
watched it, my mom caught glimpses of it and thought it was trash. She saw
the execessive violence as a turn off and assumed it was a perverse and
blood ridden film. Then she actually watched the last third of the film,
and
at the end, I saw the look of disbelief in her face. She is a Medical
Doctor
and she understood at once one of the central themes in the movie. She,
just
like I and my brother, place this film as one of the top five films I have
ever watched. The main theme she enjoyed in the movie was how the whole
movie was an excercise in self therapy. However the theme I enjoy is hwo
the
commercialism of America was portrayed and how he battled this facet of
society in America. His self indulgence of &quot;the perfect living room&quot;, how
he
got funding for the club, and how he was able to defeat the &quot;towers&quot; of
capitalistic society in America where truly great moments of satire in the
film.  There where only two flaws in the movie I saw. One was that there
wasn't very good flow and cohesion in terms of the script and how it
blended
with the different themes. The second was the theme of rebellion and how
violence in the film portrayed this theme. I am convinced that the
director
added it in for shock value, as it's theme is not fully explored and was
too
excessive in demonstrating the rage that that Generation possesed. The
only
relevant violent scenes where the two times he inflicted self damage on
himself, once as Tyler, and once as himself. Both where an attempt to
exploit the Capitalism to forward his own motives, and both scenes where
excellent executions of satire.<br /><br />In essence, this movie would have been just as effective without the
unneccessary violence, though it is still powerful and relevant in
demonstrating it's central themes.
