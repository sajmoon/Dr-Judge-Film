1999_November 29 

There is but one word to describe this film ... Clever.<br /><br />The fad today seems to be questioning reality, &quot;Dark City&quot; and &quot;The
Matrix&quot;
are two such examples. Ity appears we wish so hard to really be something
else, something with no rules, limits, or boundaries were we can do
anything
we like. Surprisingly enough that is exactly what this film is
about.<br /><br />Forget any elaborate setup, forget about a plot that makes sense,
disregard conventional filmmaking and shot composition and remember this
film is about a message! Plain and simple!<br /><br />Many films have a theme or a point and they present it to the audience
for
your judgement. This film kicks you in the nuts and slams its opinion down
your throat while you are vunerable. The genius of it all is when you
discover that what you thought was happening had nothing to do with what
was
happening. The line &quot;we are the all-singing all-dancing crap of the world&quot;
summs up the whole film and is a refreshing look at that old term &quot;Carpe
Deim&quot; in a very 90's sense of the word. So nineties in fact that even you
the viewer may require counselling after seeing this film.<br /><br />Unlike films like &quot;the Matrix&quot; there was not tool of thing as it were
that
allowed the main character to alter his lifes boundaries and rules. He had
the guts to go through with it all and in the end it was himself that had
got him to were he was and that is what I admire most about the
film.<br /><br />I give this film a huge thumbs up and recommend it to everyone and leave
a
small suggestion as well. Take in what the film has to say and maybe even
give it a go someday.
