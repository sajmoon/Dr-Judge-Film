Fight Club definitely is one of the best movies of the 1990s.  Edward
Norton
has had a stellar career, but this role for him ranks right up with his
roles in American History X and 25th Hour.  Brad Pitt is stellar, as
always,
in a role that seemed almost made for him.<br /><br />The one thing I appreciate about this movie is it's attention to detail.
Certainly, it would be impossible to do a movie of this nature without
making sure that every little thing fit, but the fact that it does blows
me
away.  I went in to watching this movie, the first time, not knowing at
all
what it was about.  I took my standard movie-watching mind into it, and
assumed that I wouldn't and couldn't be surprised at the ending, in fact,
the idea of a surprise ending never even entered my mind.  Little did I
know
the surprise I was about to experience.<br /><br />The second (and subsequent) times you watch Fight Club, you see all the
things you missed, all the clues that would have led you to figure things
out for yourself.  Of course, normally, you'd miss it and feel like an
idiot, but since the movie is woven together so well, most of your
observations are left to, &quot;Oh my, that's so clever!&quot;<br /><br />Few people dislike this movie, and those are people who are either too
uptight or want their movies all to be cut from the same Nora Ephron mold
(not that there is anything wrong with Nora Ephron movies).<br /><br />If you haven't seen Fight Club, you need to see it right away, and if you
have seen it, why not watch it again?  It's one of the best movies of the
90s, after all.
