1999_October 30 

Going in to this film I had no real idea what to expect of this movie as I
purposely avoided reading all reviews of the movie where the plot was
revealed or discussed. I was pleasantly surprised with what I saw.<br /><br />This is not a film with excessive violence without context as some critics
would like to have us believe. Among other things the film makes a none too
subtle comment about the fabric that make up our human existence and the
fact that sometimes pain is the only aspect of life that seems real to any
of us.<br /><br />Instead of condoning the behaviours in the film the director (in what is
perhaps Fincher's best work) continually emphasizes the relationship between
what the characters are feeling and what the characters are doing. We see
vividly the conflict within Edward Norton's character as the film progresses
and we are effectively drawn into the movie taking each turn with him.<br /><br />The pacing of the movie is maintained superbly throughout and together with
the direction, cinematography, and dialogue serve to create a movie packed
with enough surprise to entice any true movie fan.<br /><br />The acting throughout is excellent with excellent performances by Edward
Norton, Brad Pitt and Meatloaf. All of the actors turn in performances
worthy of comparison to their best work to date.<br /><br />I truly hope that the greatness of this movie is not sullied by over
analysis of it's violent content (Natural Born Killers certainly was) as it
reaches into far deeper realms than the surface would immediately suggest.<br /><br />Rating: A<br /><br />
