Fight Club is unique <br /><br />Story: <br /><br />First rule of Fight Club is ... You don't talk about Fight Club <br /><br />Jack (Edward Norton) is a bored car recall inspector caught in the
middle of mediocrity in a rat race that he cannot get out of. He
suffers from chronic insomnia, never knowing where his life is going
from one moment to the next in his white collar, materialistic world.
Jack begins attending support groups for any disease imaginable, in
order to feel needed and part of something. His insomnia disappears and
suddenly he feels alive for the first time in years. On a flight he
meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Tyler is a charismatic Soap salesman
who has a whole different slant on life that captivates Jack. Jack
returns to find his apartment has been destroyed by a gas explosion and
as a last resort he asks Tyler for a place to stay. Together they
discuss lifes trivialities. They decide that the only way to feel alive
is to really live. They form Fight Club. A secret group that meets with
the sole purpose of staging fights between its members. Forget the gym,
jogging or even sex. This is the way to get that adrenaline rushing, to
get fit and make you a stronger, more focused person. The first rule of
Fight Club is: Don't Talk about Fight Club. The Second Rule of Fight
Club is : Don't talk about fight club !. Welcome to Fight Club.<br /><br />My opinion:<br /><br />Fight club goes further then any movie ever created, it is almost
perfect: The acting, Story-line, plot twists, Strange electronic
Soundtrack, tense, action and of course the qlimax ending ! Brad pitt
did a great job and Edward norton is just showing us one of the best
performances ever showed in a movie ( can compete with marlon brando in
Godfather and deniro in raging bull and taxidriver) David fincher (not
my favorite director) has created one of the Best movies by giving it
that dark atmosphere just like he did in se7en.<br /><br />This movie is certainly listed in my top 5 of all time and is probably
never going to be replaced, because i like this movie so much and
watcht it so many times discovering new things every time.<br /><br />9.8 / 10 One of the best in all ways !
