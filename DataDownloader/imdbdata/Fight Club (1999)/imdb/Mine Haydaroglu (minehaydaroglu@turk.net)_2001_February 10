This is definitely a work of genius. David Fincher, Edward Norton (amazing
actor!), Brad Pitt, Chuck Palahniuk, Jim Uhls... everyone has done a
wonderful job. I am overwhelmed by the depth, the sensivity that is
reflected in all levels here.
I also want to add that this film did very well in Turkey in the box
office,
and was chosen as the best film of 1999 by the film critics.
And believe me there is a serious crowd of film lovers
here.
