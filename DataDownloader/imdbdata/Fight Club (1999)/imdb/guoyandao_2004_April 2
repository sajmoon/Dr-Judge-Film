I hope this does not infringe copyright but first of all I have to quote
this humourous commentary i saw somewhere:<br /><br />&quot;I thought I had already seen the worst movie of 1999 but after watching
&quot;Fight Club,&quot; this was wrong as &quot;Fight Club&quot; took the honor. There was no
point to this film and it was the waste of talent for two otherwise
excellent actors.<br /><br />There is not much to say about &quot;Fight Club&quot; because there was nothing
worthwhile to remember. After the first ten minutes of this film, I
realized
I was watching a film that is best described by the condition of the house
the two lead characters were living in old, delapidated, rundown and an
ugly
home. Brad Pitt made a wrong career move selecting &quot;Fight Club&quot; and Edward
Norton just wasn't thinking as he made his decision.<br /><br />With a story that made no sense, action that was non-existent and
performances that were poor; &quot;Fight Club&quot; was nothing more than a time and
space filler for the studios. &quot;<br /><br />Well that was the most perfect demonstration of how a milestone movie can
be
spoilt by Spiderman-Independence Day-Titanic fans. No offense to those
fans
though, but this is a movie that compels you to think, like Matrix, like
American Beauty. It's not a popcorn-and-tears movie. I'm
sorry.<br /><br />I've read plenty of reviews after I watched it coz I couldn't completely
understand it. But the fact is, nobody seems to do either. So there're
either too much gimmicks, or too much depth. I hope it's the
latter.<br /><br />To me, it is a movie that reflects on the age of modernization and
commercialization. We are all slaves of the lives we pursue. To Tyler
Durden, only destruction, which leads to nullifying the society
established
on paychecks and credit cards, can save the human beings out of this
vicious
cycle. It's a struggle against the loss of sanity or freedom in a
capitalistic world. That's why fight club. That's why fighting.<br /><br />So why the hell Jack(if that's his name) made a compromise to Tyler's
ambition in the end? Coming back to reality? Tragedy of
life?<br /><br />Tyler Durden is so unforgettable. Brad Pitt put in an unparalleled
performance.<br /><br />The camerawork is revolutionary, I believe Matrix drew inspiration from
it.
And the dialogue is brilliant and stunning. In many ways it is comparable
to
American Beauty(browbeating the boss), which has a tragic ending as well.
Both are classic.<br /><br />The only thing I'm confused with is Helena's role. What the hell is she
doing here? I hope it's not another Hollywood trick that murdered a
masterpiece.<br /><br />9.5/10
