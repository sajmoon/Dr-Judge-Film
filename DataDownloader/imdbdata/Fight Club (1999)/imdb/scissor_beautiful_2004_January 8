My friend recommended this movie to me. I thought it would just be a
complete blood fest, without much story.
However, I was so suprised, I sat and watched it all, AMAZED. I thought it
was absolutly fantastic!
Brad Pitt played his role excellently, but I think the credit for acting
should go to Edward Norton. His role was full of black-humour, and he
played
it perfectly.
The story was powerful, it was clever and beautiful, all about finding
your
inner self. It had so many twists, and I never got bored at any point in
the
film.
I think it's also important not to let the violence put you off. The film
is
about so much more, and works on so many levels, I think everyone could
bring out a different meaning.
This is one of the greatest films I have ever watched- and I would
recommend
it to anyone. I told my Mum to sit down and watch it!
