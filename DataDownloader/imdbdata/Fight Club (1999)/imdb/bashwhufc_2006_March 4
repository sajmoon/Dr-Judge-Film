2006_March 4 
this film is one of the films that has already become a classic and
will only go to grow in stature as the years go on. it is an amazing
film which is so cleverly written. the twists are thoroughly unexpected
and all the acting is amazing. the roles seem to have been written with
brad Pitt and Edward Norton in mind. the soundtrack is very fitting and
the direction is worthy of some kind of accolade. even the camera
tricks and cgi are well used whereas in some films they can ruin it. it
stands up to repeated re-watchings and in fact is more appreciated
after repeated watchings. the idea of setting up a cathartic
underground boxing club seems to be a bit far-fetched yet the
brilliance of the writing means that you never question the credibility
of the film. all in all this is a dark, funny, heavy, intelligent film
that will change your outlook on life
