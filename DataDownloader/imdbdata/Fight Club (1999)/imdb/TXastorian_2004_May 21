Ed Norton character: &quot;I don't know. I'm just not content with my life. I
have a job that doesn't do anything to benefit mankind. I have so many
possessions, but they don't make me happy. I just feel there must be more to
life than this shallow, commercial, material world I live in. I want to do
something different.&quot;<br /><br />Me: &quot;Well, it's very commendable of you to re-evaluate your priorities. So,
since you don't like your material possessions, are you going to get rid of
all your IKEA furniture and move to a smaller apartment, one that you
actually feel comfortable in?&quot;<br /><br />Norton: No.<br /><br />Me: Well, since your job isn't fulfilling, are you going to quit and join
the PEace Corps, or get a job as a teacher in an poor neighborhood?<br /><br />Norton: Nah.<br /><br />Me: Well, since you're looking for some higher meaning to life, are you
going to start going to church?<br /><br />Norton: Nope.<br /><br />Me: Sigh... okay, so what ARE you going to do?<br /><br />Norton: I think I'll get together with a bunch of other unfulfilled guys,
and then we'll beat the snot out of each other.<br /><br />**<br /><br />If that strikes you as profound, well, then &quot;Fight Club&quot; is the movie for
you. If it sounds ridiculous (and it should!), avoid it like the
plague.<br /><br />The ironic and amusing thing is, most of the fanboys who rave about this
movie are geeks who couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag, and would
run crying to their mommies if someone even LOOKED like he was going to
throw a punch at them!
