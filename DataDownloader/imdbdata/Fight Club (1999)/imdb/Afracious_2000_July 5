I am Jack's Fight Club movie review.<br /><br />When I first saw this at the cinema I liked it, but didn't quite absorb it
all. After watching it several more times on DVD, I have now discovered
how
good it really is. The opening trip through the brain is amazing. The film
quickly gathers pace and never lets up, as we listen to Jack the narrator,
played by Edward Norton. He describes his life has having all the material
things, a nice condo, nice furniture, he doesn't have any monetary
worries.
But Jack needs something different to enliven his life.<br /><br />After going to many health help groups to seek solace for his insomnia, he
meets a bold character in Tyler Durden (played with relish by Brad Pitt),
a
soap salesman who becomes friendly with Jack. One night outside a bar, the
two guys decide to have a fight, what the heck it's different they say.
After this initial scrap, the two guys start their own underground fight
club, and the membership expands rapidly. It seems there are many young
men
out there who want to fight. After some brutal fight scenes, Tyler starts
Project Mayhem, whose purpose is to disrupt corporate buildings, and to
generally cause mayhem.<br /><br />The other pawn in the film is Marla Singer, played by Helena Bonham
Carter,
who sleeps with Tyler and annoys Jack. The distrust between Jack and Tyler
finally erupts into a frenzied finale, as the the surprising outcome is
revealed. The film throbs with energy, style and an enigmatic spirit.
After
Seven and The Game, Fight Club reinforces David Fincher as a talented
director.<br /><br />I am Jack's The End.
