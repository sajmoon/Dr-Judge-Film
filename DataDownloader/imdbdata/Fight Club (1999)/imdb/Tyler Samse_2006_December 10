Fight Club is the Man&#39;s Manual to Manhood. My friend Josh told me that
once, and I have got to say, I agree with him 100%. Fight Club is one
of the most entertaining, exciting, and explosive movies ever to hit
the big screen. It&#39;s a love story entangled in the ideas of Anarchy and
explosive. It all begins with a man called Jack who is depressed and
begins going to support groups and meets a girl named Marla. His
insomnia starts all over again. Then he meets Tyler Durden, a man of
mystery and unusual substance. Tyler sells soap. Together they create
Fight Club which is an underground boxing society, their idea catches
on and spreads quickly and evolves into Project Mayhem. Jack eventually
stops Tyler who turns out to be his alter ego. The end. An awesome film
with great acting and performances from Brad Pitt, Edward Norton,
Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf, and even Jared Leto makes an
appearance in the movie as Angel Face. The movie gives a
self-destructive point of view on life and love, and explores the
possibilities of anarchy.This is definitely one no one should miss.
