After reading and hearing so many good things about this movie, I<br /><br />expected something slick and well written at least. What I saw was<br /><br />a loose, sloppy, romanticised portrait of a sociopathic<br /><br />schitzophrenic. The overall silliness of the first five minutes is an<br /><br />indicator that this is not a movie to take too seriously, which is fine<br /><br />if this were any kind of comedy-but it just isn't. It isn't campy, and it<br /><br />isn't funny in any parts. The potential for this film was much higher<br /><br />than it turned out, especially with all the great talent of so many of<br /><br />the actors, and having such a unique idea for the main plot. Brad<br /><br />Pitt was excellent, as were so many of the supporting actors.<br /><br />Norton was not, but he had an impossible task doing something<br /><br />the screenwriter and director wanted, but which was to be almost<br /><br />not human at all. He was forced to be both very inhuman and<br /><br />inhumane. If someone is really inhuman, it is difficult for the viewer<br /><br />to empathize unless they have the same tendency of being<br /><br />sociopathic. An inhumane sociopath is a fascinating film subject,<br /><br />but not if they are robotic.
Yes, I'm over 45, but I enjoy many kinds of youthful films, or can at<br /><br />least see why they are liked. I enjoy a wide variety of artistic,<br /><br />abstract, and strange films, as well as mainstream blockbusters. I<br /><br />base my opinion on overall excellence, not on technical<br /><br />achievement. Actually a movie this bad, but at the same time<br /><br />innovative, would have benefitted from being made more low<br /><br />budget, without all the expensive scenery, props and special<br /><br />effects. Then it might have focused more on humans and have<br /><br />better insight into the main character's condition and mind, instead<br /><br />of being merely hinted at, glossed over, and romanticized. All the<br /><br />good and bad things that can justifiably be said about this film, the<br /><br />most truthful one that stands out the most is that it is just raw<br /><br />stupidity. I realize it is a fantasy story. But that a wimp like Norton<br /><br />could convince a horde of millions (all men-no women by the way,<br /><br />since women in the whole world are apparatently only inanimate<br /><br />sex objects) to convert to some sorry cult with no causes other<br /><br />than anarchism and individual brutality, is beyond stupidity.
This film does have good technical qualities and some great<br /><br />acting; and it does have content. Some special effects movies<br /><br />have no real content or human interaction. This does have some<br /><br />good content, but it is heavily diluted with bad story writing and too<br /><br />much emphasis on a selfish, unknowable character.
