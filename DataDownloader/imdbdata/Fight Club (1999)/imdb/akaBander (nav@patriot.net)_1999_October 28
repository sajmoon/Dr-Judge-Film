1999_October 28 

It would be hard to do this film justice in just a few paragraphs... In
short, I'd just like to say that Fight Club is one of the rarest of things
-- relentlessly thrilling and deeply thought-provoking. Even better, it
doesn't moralize or instruct the audience on how to react to the issues it
forces into the open. The ambiguity of the ethical issues combined with the
graphic and gritty violence makes this film much more powerful than the
trailer could possibly convey.<br /><br />The only unambiguous judgement made in the story allows Fincher to play a
consumate irony on the audience. He at once harshly criticizing the
&quot;Ikea&quot;/yuppie value-system, and puts the attack in a package that will
appeal to the scions of just that aesthetic.
