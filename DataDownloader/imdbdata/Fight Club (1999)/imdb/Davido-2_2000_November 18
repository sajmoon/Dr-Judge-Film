<br /><br />Fight club seems to fit into a genre of end of century, nihilistic Xer
stories of which Extension du Domaine de la Lutte (US title Whatever) and
American Beauty are others.<br /><br />Compared to the book it is perhaps a little heavily done and leads the
viewer too much by the hand.  Maybe that is one of the restrictions of
making films of which the main audience is American.  However it did
remain
very faithful to the spirit of a brilliant and disturbing
book.<br /><br />Changing the ending was simply gratuitous, was this what the preview
audiences or the studio demanded for a major release or was it the idea of
the director all along?<br /><br />A book which captures the zeitgeist, it is perhaps a little early to say
whether it will be a classic in ten or even fifty years time or just a
curio.
