1999_December 2 

A few days ago I walked in to this film by chance and walked
out with the usual burst of energy I get from films that
captivate me completely. Surprising,frightening,visually
stunning,soundwise
top notch(I'm an audio engineer and boy would I like to know about those
impact sounds) and acting so good,
I didn't doubt the characters at any time. Clever plot, no unnecessary
shots
anywhere and chock full of humor too.<br /><br />If you don't mind the violence,which is realistic to a frightening degree,
go out and watch this.
If you thought Matrix was visually stunning, check this
out.
It will blow your mind. It made me smile.<br /><br />Tony
