This movie will bowl you over! No matter what movie you think this is -
it&#x27;s different. <br /><br />It&#x27;s like nothing you&#x27;ve ever seen before! It should have gotten the
Oscar and even more... If there was an Oscar for best story, best lines
and best end, Fight Club would&#x27;ve won it all! <br /><br />The actors are also splendid: Nobody could fit better into the role,
that was actually described by Chuck Palahniuk in his book exactly like
Helena Bonham Carter, of Marla Singer! A little bit different from the
characters in the book are Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and ... let&#x27;s call
him &#x27;The Narrator&#x27; (Edward Norton). But still, the two of them are
terrific and you couldn&#x27;t imagine who could play them better! Tyler
Durden is probably the coolest guy ever. <br /><br />There are hints for what the story will truly end like, but even if you
try hard, you will only notice them after the first watch of the movie,
it might also take more than twice... <br /><br />This movie is probably one of the best 3 movies ever! Everything&#x27;s
perfect in that. Watch it - it&#x27;s an order ;) .
