I would like to clarify the fact that the narrator's character is not
named
&quot;Jack.&quot;  He was reading the magazines in the house on Paper Street when
he
came across an article where he read &quot;I am Jack's medula oblongotta&quot; or
however you spell that.  Anyways, my point is that the reason he kept
using
that phrase over and over was because of the magazine... his name is
never
revealed during the movie.
