1999_November 4 

When Susan Faluhdi wrote a piece saluting this film, but
really
promoting her own book Stiffed, I decided I'd better have a look.  We're
nearing the end of the Century and the Millenium
and the jig is up in nearly every direction.  The Cold War
is
over. The major political fights in America are over lifestyle
issues.  The folks producing films are forced to use vaguely
focused Arab terrorists as villians, because the traditional
communists are our friends, sort of.  And Feminists are
writing
books in defense of abused MEN.<br /><br />Its the perfect backdrop for a story about young guys so fed
up
with the ennui of these times, their only relief comes
from
knocking one another senseless.  First its the two friends,
Brad Pitt and Ed Norton who knock one another about while living in a broken
down abandoned building.  But in the words of an old Chrysler commercial, it
starts a movement, a momentum a beat.  And the Beat Goes On with fight clubs
forming all over America.<br /><br />You would think Pitt would be the lead here, but its Ed
Norton
handling the narrative, the voice-over.  Ed goes thru the
usual contortions.  Bored in the meaningless job he holds in
the
corporate world, Norton quits and takes up an equally meaningless unemployed
existence with Pitt. Why work for the soulless corporate machine when you
can appear just as prosperous with no job at all.<br /><br />Lingering in the background is a decidedly un-English-looking Helen Bonham
Carter.  Helen hasn't a lot to do but smoke cigs and look downmarket and
fetching.  The storytellers are holding
her out here in hopes that either Norton or Pitt will make
a move on her.  For Pitt, that is out of the question.
Norton walks her home a couple of times. But Helen doesn't<br /><br />really get a lot of action in this movie.  So much for
the
love interest.<br /><br />The movie is a guy thing you see.  I can barely remember
what
the climactic scene at the end is about.  Its just a lot of cosmic acting
out; Jimmy Carter's Malaise. Its supposed to mean
something, but it doesn't have to really, since its producing
the requisite violence for a $75 million domestic gross. The violence is
meaningless but necessary to stir interest among
the 18-34 year old demographic this film is aimed at. Go see the Brad Pitt
movie about Tibet, or catch Ed singing in that Woody Allan film of a few
years ago.  The Fight Club should have been aborted at
birth.
