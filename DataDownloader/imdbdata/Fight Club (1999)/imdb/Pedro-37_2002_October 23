I guess enough has been said in previous comments about the brilliance of
David Fincher's &quot;Fight Club&quot;. I don't want to give yet another insight into
the movie, but rather my personal feelings.<br /><br />I think it's the best movie of 1999 and one of the best of the decade. Even
more so, it's the most watchable. I might consider &quot;Star Wars&quot; a better
film. Or &quot;Schindler's List&quot; - but I never like watching them the way I like
watching &quot;Fight Club&quot;. If I wouldn't be such a movie fan and feel the urge
to see at least 10 new movies a week, I'd watch &quot;Fight Club&quot; every day. It
belongs to a group of movies that never stop to amaze me and that I can
watch again and again and again. Other movies in that list would be
&quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, &quot;First Contact&quot;, &quot;South
Park&quot;, &quot;Aliens&quot;. There's more, but I should get back to &quot;Fight
Club&quot;.<br /><br />What probably makes the movie so watchable for me is that I connect with it
and perfectly well know that there are a lot that don't. I have the
satisfying feeling of getting along with Fincher on his ride. That he made
this movie just for me. I can admire the performances, I can inhale the
incredible style, I can laugh out loud about the satire and the satire
behind the satire, I can melt at the sight of Brad Pitt's abs or I can be
amazed at how incredibly daring the film is. That all I can - and that all I
don't while watching it. Because I'm way too engaged. I'm much more involved
than with other movies. Involved in the overall excitement, not any
particular component. In the perfection of the movie. And after it's over, I
feel satisfied. Well, yes, that does sound a lot like sex - but I don't want
to explore *that* discussion any further ...<br /><br />Has it any flaws? Every movie has. I think it drags a little bit in the
second half. So what. I don't care. I don't want to care. Because I love
that movie so much, I forget about the flaws. I feel good that there still
are movies being made that I can put my emotions into. That I can love. Yes,
I said it before, one can love a movie. The ability to do so separates the
film goer from the film fan. Or addict. &quot;Fight Club&quot; is why I love movies (I
stole that line from Ebert's &quot;Fargo&quot;-review but it really applies here). And
not related to everything I've written before: I'd love to have a fight with
Brad. Just a thought. &quot;You have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.&quot;
Just a line I like to insert here. Ok, the review starts falling apart, it's
time to end it ... Rating? Well, I guess you already know...<br /><br />10/10
