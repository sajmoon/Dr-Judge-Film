This is one of those in your face controversial movies that has a lot
of high minded and loud things to say about the state of society and
gender roles and violence in the media and escapism and capitalism,
starred hot to trot actors of the moment (Brad Pitt and the wonderfully
droll Edward Norton), featured a change of pace role for the exquisite
Helene Bonham Carter, was directed by a man almost too stylish and too
smart for his own good (David Fincher), and was adapted from an equally
warped book. Darkly funny, ultra-violent, and sometimes scary, this is
for people with strong stomachs and hungry minds.<br /><br />(POTENTIAL SPOILER) If you don&#39;t think this movie is as relevant in the
post 9/11 era as it was when it first bombarded movie theaters, just
take take a look at the closing scene before the credits where
skyscrapers come tumbling down thanks to some terrorist bombs. It was
gut dropping then, and seems eerily prophetic and on-target now.
