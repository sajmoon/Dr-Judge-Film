2004_January 5 

The first I saw this picture I really blew it because I had to do
something
else mattered then and just messed it up by taking a brief look at its
end.
Although a while later I gave it chance to watch and once I did it I got
really nailed-up! How wonderfully this was shot! How similar the main
actor
is to me!<br /><br />The most important issue should be pointed out is how realistically
Edward
Norton acted in a tired-of-life guy's role and how mischievous Brad Pitt
was
in there. As much in all movies I have seen from Brad Pitt as I can think
of
as a person who's been able to live up the role assigned to him like
Se7en,
O11. His self-ego must be having a quality giving a chance to any kind of
role in Cinema.<br /><br />I too much highly recommend it for all generation because it won't ever
be
forgotten. (10 +++ / 10)
