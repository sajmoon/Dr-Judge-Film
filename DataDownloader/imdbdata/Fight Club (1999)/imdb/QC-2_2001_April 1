I can't say any more. Acting....wonderful, storyline....great,
characterisation....magnificent. Edward Norton is an incredibly talented
actor who I have had the utmost respect for since American History X. His
performance in this film enhances this reputation and I urge anyone who
hasn't yet seen this film to get it!
10/10
