1999_October 30 

This is by far the best movie of the '90s.
The book was brilliant, the movie surprisingly great, entertaining and will
make you think about it for a long time.<br /><br />I won't talk about fight club but i must say it has also some cool
special-fx that really fits nicely into the story.
