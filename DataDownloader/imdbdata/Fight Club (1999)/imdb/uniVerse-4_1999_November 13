1999_November 13 
The talent that came together in this movie succeeds in delivering a
powerful gut-punch that is both disturbing and affirming. Pitt and
Norton are excellent as archetypes of a push/pull many of us feel-
between comfortably numb and the stark reality of existence with all
its terror and tender sweetness. What didn't come through enough,
perhaps (delivered in a number of lines by Pitt but not shown as
experience) was just how amplified the sweetness is once we embrace and
accept the terror. A movie worth seeing twice, talking about, mulling
over and, ultimately, acting on. But how to do that in an urban
landscape, without the extremes of fight club, is a puzzle left to sort
out alone. Blowing up buildings, of course, is a symptom of, not at
solution to alienation. We must embrace our mortality - someone said
you must die in some sense to understand your true self.
