1999_October 21 

I had high hopes for this film.  I have liked Fincher's previous films, The
Game and Seven.  I did like the humor in the film.  Helen Bonham Carter's
role was a nothing role.  I think Fincher was trying to say to people to
think for themselves and break free of this rampant commercialism.  His
message gets lost with all the pummeling that takes place in the film.  I
don't know of anyone who would want to take a beating on a consistent
basis.
This movie seems to say that fascism is good, but I am sure Fincher's
intent was the opposite.  The ending was also contrived and not convincing.
Brad Pitt and Edward Norton both perform well in the film.  Meat Loaf also
has a good supporting role.  It is not enough however for me to recommend
this film.
