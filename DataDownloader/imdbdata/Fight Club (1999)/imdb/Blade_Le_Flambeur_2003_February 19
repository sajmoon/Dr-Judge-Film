After hearing that this film was very good I decided to rent it. I was
stunned. This movie combines great visuals with an excellent screenplay and
is nicely topped with superb acting. The movie has a tendency to get weird,
but not too weird. Norton is superb here, he gives great atmosphere with his
narration and gives an excellent performance as a confused individual.
Helena Bolham Carter is fine here, she acts like a suicidial, crazy person
with good percsion. The real star here is Brad Pit whose performance in this
movie is only equalled by his performance in 12 Monkeys. He adds such a
great presence to Tyler Durden, its amazing. The only problem I had with
this film is one Norton learns the &quot;deal&quot; with Tyler Durden, the movie loses
its impact and becomes more of a hollywood type of movie. Concerning the
rating, there are one or two heavy sex scenes, the occasional swearing, but
I was surprised by the amount of violence. There isn't really that much, but
when there is, it gets bloody. Really bloody. Unfortunately I knew the
ending before hand, so not much of a surprise there. Fight Club combines
ingenius storytelling to amazing visuals. Quite simply one of the best films
ever made. 9.75/10
