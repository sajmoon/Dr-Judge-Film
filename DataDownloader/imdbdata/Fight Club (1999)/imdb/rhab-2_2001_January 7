At times this film can be interesting to look at, but otherwise, what a
waste of talent!  The lead character, played by Ed Norton, is miserable and
depressed throughout.  Who wants to watch that?  I think the reason there
was voice over narration was because after viewing the first cut, the
producers realized nobody would know what the point of all this was. So
they
put in a voice over every 5 minutes that tells us about all the
realizations
Norton's character is coming to.
