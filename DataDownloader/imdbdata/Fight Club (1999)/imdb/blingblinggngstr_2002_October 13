This movie was pretty crazy and the fact that Tyler Durden was his split
personality was unexpected, because the whole movie the audience actually
gets to see Tyler. This movie had a lot of CGI that made the movie really
good, and the color saturation that David Fincher put it was also cool. Its
a new type of movie that there should be a lot more of. Fight Club is going
to need to be seen a couple of times to find out what's really going on too.
The movie also never gets old so if you buy it on DVD or something you wont
regret it.
