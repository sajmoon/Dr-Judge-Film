After watching this movie, I wanted to move into a broken house and get
in touch with the primordial nature that has been silenced in men
everywhere by years of materialism bullshit. I think that Tyler Durden
starts off as the only sane character in the movie, and everyone else
who is stuck in their lame, capitalistic world are the crazy ones. It&#39;s
movies like these that make me sad that Brad Pitt sometimes gets coined
as a &quot;pretty boy&quot;, because I think this is proof that he&#39;s a great
actor. Edward Norton and he play off each other so well. The
cinematography is very unique, without being pretentiously &quot;artistic&quot;.
I only wish that I could give this movie more stars than just ten.
