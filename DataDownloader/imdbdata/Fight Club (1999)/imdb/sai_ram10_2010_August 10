i was told this was a good movie by many of my friends, but none of
them actually revealed the plot summary of the film... so one day i
finally wanted to watch this film, as per the title i thought this film
was based on some street fights kind of stuff, but trust me this film
really made my day, the acting, dialogs, action and this movie turned
out to be a different genre all together to what i expected to be.. it
was a perfect psychological thriller with a good story.... actually i
don&#x27;t like watching movie twice, but after watching this movie, i
immediately wanted to watch this again... that proves this movie
stamina... the scene were the brad pit points the gun at guy asking
what he wanted to do and what he is doing... that scene needs to
appreciated, because most of us don&#x27;t do what they really wanted to do,
only thing i dint like about this movie was the title of the film,
which might create the wrong impression on this movie otherwise this is
a strongly recommended to watch..
