This often pretty brutal examination of the male psyche is certainly a
very dynamic piece of film-making. David Fincher has to be given a
great deal of credit for imbuing his film with an enormous amount of
energy and invention. It&#x27;s a movie infused with adrenalin both
thematically and stylistically. So job well done. The two lead actors
are massive in contributing to this. Ed Norton supplies the edge, while
Brad Pitt the movie star charisma. Both are ideal in their respective
roles. There is a wicked sense of humour present throughout the film
with a number of very funny moments. While the sense of the bizarre is
ever present. This is hardly a realist strand of film-making. Fight
Club is a dramatic film that is very fantastical. It doesn&#x27;t really
make it&#x27;s intentions very clear cut. It leaves you the audience to
decide for yourself what you make of it. This no doubt contributed to
it&#x27;s initial failure at the box office. It requires a bit more work
from the viewer than most films. But it is also one of those movies
that demands to be re-watched; it comes at you from an entirely
different angle when you know the outcome in advance. Definitely one of
the 90&#x27;s most original studio releases.
