Having looked at the IMDB list of top 250 films, I was intrigued to see that
Fight Club was ranked so highly and rented it on this basis alone.  For the
most part I think the list is good with a few exceptions.  I have seen
countless films, old and new, and consider myself well versed in film.  I
also liked Fincher's 'Seven' alot so I figured this would be pretty good. 
THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS.  If you are thinking of watching this
for the first time put it back.  The camerawork may be stylish but that does
not make a good picture (There have been a lot of bad movies with style). 
The plot and underlying themes are absurd and the 'twist' in the movie along
with the ending are both predictable and unintelligent.  There is very
little to like about the story or characters and it is overly long (Two and
a half hours of my life that I want back).  One of the weakest movies in a
year of weak movies (1999) with the exeception of 'Magnolia.' I am very
disappointed that this movie ranks so high. Everyone that ranks this movie
in their top 10 should truly see some more of America's Greatest Films
(Check out AFI's list, they have the right idea)
