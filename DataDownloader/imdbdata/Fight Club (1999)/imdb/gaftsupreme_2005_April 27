This movie changed my life forever. Saw it when i was 17 . Seen it like
32 times since. It's like a bible. I started working out the next day,
started reading politics books, became interested in all sorts of
anti-corporate protests,and bought all Palahniuk books i could find.
Since then i've turned 4 others into fight club addicts. I think this
movie really pushes u to do something with ur life or do nothing at
all.Teaches u to be brave and always look things with guts.I find the
movie to be an incredible experience for any teen and anybody who has
taken his life for granted. It shows part of our society and our human
nature many had ignored and it serves as a warning for the world and
life style some are trying to impose on us.&quot;We are not beautiful and
unique snow flakes&quot;.People in modern societies have so many useless
items of comfort,that we are distracted from the meaning of life. Our
roles of consumers make sheep of of us, and corporations are our
Shepperd. e need to be careful and not turn into slaves. I will always
love Fight Club. <br /><br />In Tyler We Trust
