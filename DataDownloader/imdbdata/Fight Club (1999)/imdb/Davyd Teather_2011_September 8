Fight club is one of the best movies to come out of Hollywood ever.
This movie just really blew me away. Upon it&#x27;s released, it spawned a
lot of controversy. On the Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show, she gave away the
ending for the movie. How could she do something like that? She spoiled
the ending. Luckily I did not see that episode of Rosie O&#x27;Donnell.
Shame on you Rosie O&#x27;Donnell. Just because you did not like the movie,
doesn&#x27;t give you the right to spoil the movie for everybody else. If I
directed this movie, I would be very furious with you. All that aside,
this movie is not just about the fighting and violence. It is more
about the whys of the violence. If you have not seen this movie yet,
rent it or buy it from your local video store. This movie is a true
masterpiece.
