When our protagonist cant sleep due to his insomnia, he gets addicted
to self help groups. Then out of the blue Marla starts to copy his
following, going to all the same groups. Then we meet Tyler. Tyler
makes soap and is full of facts about explosives. After they bash each
other senseless one night, everyday people want to join in the fight;
fight club is made.<br /><br />This is the modern day classic. With the dark, provocative subject
matter to the engulfing visuals, its just pure brilliance. The social
commentary here is like no other. Complexities of individuals,
consumerism; not having the answers, masculinity and freedom. Just to
f**k it all and cut the strings and be free. All the people who join
fight club have a very hubris attitude, using fight club as a way of
escaping their problems. This shows how its hard to change who we are,
we do sometimes need to become sheep to then break away.<br /><br />Daivd Fincher is our modern day Stanley Kubrick, one of the most
detailed directors around. In his bio, he did roughly 100 takes for one
scene in the movie panic room. You could call that obsessive, but it
makes his movies so flawless.<br /><br />Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are just great together and its the best
work they have ever done. Helena Bonham Carter, who i feel is very
underrated, is so perfect as Marla. She makes Marla so naive yet she is
the strongest character in the movie.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie, you better run out now and see this.
