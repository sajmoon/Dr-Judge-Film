A truly mind bending film. This has to be Norton and Pitts finest film. They
portray their characters brilliantly and I couldn't turn my head away from
my TV the second I put it in my DVD player. Everything about this film is so
perfect and amazing. Some of the effects with the cameras and sounds are
brilliant. The script in my eyes is the best I have ever heard. Get this
film now! You will not be disappointed.
