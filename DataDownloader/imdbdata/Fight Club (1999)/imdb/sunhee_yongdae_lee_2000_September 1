2000_September 1 

Before I saw this movie on video, I heard lots of people
saying
how great this movie was, however my reaction is quite shocked and disgusted
by this movie as much as Seven.
The plot and the ending sure were different from other cheezy Hollywood
Block Busters. I also admire the director and the actors for making a movie
that many of directors and actors wouldn't have done.  Norton's acting was
good but Pitt was bit pretencious, not that I'm jealousy of his good looking
or anything.  The first opening scene was cool but that was it.  I was
offended by most of the nasty violence especially for the ending scene. 
Beside the vilonce, this movie's motto is not different from other cynical
movies that assert the world is not fair and screw it.  If David Fincher was
totally indifferent to succeed at box office and make a culture film, he
could've used an actor who might look less good but has a better acting
skill than Pitt. If anyone wants to see see a sick, but meaningful movie, I
would recommand Train Spotting.
