2000_January 19 

I went to see this movie knowing that it was directed by 'that guy who did
se7en' and it was supposed to be pretty good!!  I was expecting some
boxing
type flick where Pitt works his way up the ranks or some such thing....How
wrong could I have been...I walked out of the cinema 2 hours later in a
daze.<br /><br />I love films that keep you on the edge never letting you know exactly
whats
happening or where the plots going to lead.  Fincher does this
brilliantly,
I looked into his past films and realised hes done it well with most of
his
other films inc The Game and Se7en.<br /><br />It has his usual dark feel, some amazing camera work and enough twists to
completely lose yourself!  Norton and Pitt work extremly well together and
both put in superb performances.<br /><br />The only thing I would moan about is the ending, Fincher seems to always
let
down there (Se7en being an exception) Alien3, The Game and Fight Club have
brilliant ideas, they keep you watching on the edge of the seat but you
get
to the end and you feel somehow let down...<br /><br />Suffice to say I would recommend this to everyone (although some squimish
people may find some of the fight scenes a bit much).  It will definitely
hit a cord with the male audience when we get asked 'what has become of
male
man in modern society?'.  Definitely one of my favourite films of
'99!
