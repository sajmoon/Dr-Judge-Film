1999_October 25 

Never, in my entire pityfull life, have I seen a movie like that. This is
an
open kick in the ass to the 'oh so good' capitalism society.
, but unlike the latter,
this movie will not bore the life out of you.<br /><br />It might open your eyes on Society. It might wake you up and make you face
huMAN nature. Do you want that to happen? No. Do you need that to happen? I
say Yes. You must face it: Violence is in the human nature. Don't get me
wrong, there is almost no free violence in that movie. They, the member of
Fight Club, fight to feel alive--just some number in the drone chain of
american(capitalism) society. While our narrator fights his biggest problem
with modern life.<br /><br />The movie is narrated by the Edward Norton's character. (Best Actor oscar
for him; he's already accepting it :) ) That character feels he is losing
his life and there is something wrong with the world around him, so he
can't
sleep. One night, on a business plane trip he meets Tyler Durden. Tyler is
exacly what the narrator is not. They click, then the fight club(s)
begin(s). But Marla, is she a threat like Tyler says? GO FIND OUT! Because
this is my interpretation of the movie, and in my humble opinion, you'll be
seeing, if you dare, a very stylished film and THE best one yet this year.
The movie tagets a male audience.<br /><br />It's an open call for revolution. Let Project Mayhem begins.
&quot;You are not a special snowflake..&quot;<br /><br />P.S. By the way, Brad Pitt plays Tyler Durden, but that's just a small
detail, right?<br /><br />The Direction: Mtv-ish at it's best. David Fincher is a
master!
The Acting: Brad Pitt is great. Edward Norton is unbelievable. Helen Bonham
Carter is good if not excellent. Meat Loaf surpasses himself. Heck, even
Jared Leto (blondie) is great! (yeah he got like 2 mins
screentime)<br /><br />I Give this movie a :    98% (10/10)
