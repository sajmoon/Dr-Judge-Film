1999_December 9 

What can I say? If you want a movie that socks you in the face, throws you
around the room and still takes you out to dinner, this is it!! It is a
cinema must! You could never watch it anywhere else and have the same
effect. The stunts and effects were out of this world, my breath was
completely taken away, given back only to be taken away again. The twists
of
the story only fitted together at the end and if you watch it twice it
would
never have the same effect. Ed Norton, Brad Pitt (Mr Psycho) and Helena
Bonham-Cater (shame about the hair) what more can I say?!!
