It is quite rare thing that movie may be better than the book it is
based on. And Fight Club actually is. I have watched it many times, the
shrill still there, while the book gathers dust on a shelf. <br /><br />I read the book in English and in Russian (BTW the translation, at
least the one I got in hand, sucks). By its sctucture it is very easy
to be turned into a script exactly like it should be POV the narrator;
OTOH it&#x27;s not rich with descriptions, visuals are rather scanty. So I
think the director and the cast did a perfect job to make movie pretty
close to the book in pace, action and picture, giving the story greater
power and subtlety by the means of cinematography; with one caveat -
the ending. I know many people like the film ending and Palanniuk
himself was quoted to prefer it. But it really doesn&#x27;t make sense to me
and makes the story more surreal and more shallow than one might
digest.<br /><br />The acting is superb. Both Pitt and Norton are at their best and though
I am not much into Helena Bonham Carter, she is amazing as Marla.
Supporting characters are all well done, too. I also always love change
of color scheme into sepia once we get into the Paper street world.
Many things like that, you just must see it. It&#x27;s an excellent film
that will blow your mind anyway.<br /><br />That said, I am far from thinking this movie (and the book whatever) to
be anything of a message. It is indeed thought-provoking but it
actually doesn&#x27;t offer a solution, nor a hint. Quite contrary it shows
how much more preferrable the existing system would be comparing to the
offered ways to get up at it. This rebellion without a cause, within
the system, against its most obscure and superficial features is just a
childish tantrum. That will pass and that is sad. BTW I would really
like those many posters who state the movie changed their lives, to
specify - how exactly? Oh wait I guess. They must have been purchasing
Che Guevara t-shirts. Those do look nice with CK briefs.
