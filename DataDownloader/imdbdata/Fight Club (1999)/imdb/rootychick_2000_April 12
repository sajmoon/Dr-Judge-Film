Simply the best film of the last (and probably next) decade. I was blown
away by this movie. A work of pure genius. In equal turns I was
entertained,
moved and ultimately affected by it. As a somewhat dis-illusioned thirty
something I really felt that it had special meaning for me. I don't agree
that this is a 'bloke' movie. I think that if you take such a narrow
minded
point of view then you are missing the point and ultimately the underlying
themes created within this cinematic masterpiece. Edward Norton is simply
incredible and is rightly described as 'one of the few truly great actors
of
our generation.' Brad Pitt was also outstanding actually playing with an
honesty too often denied a film actor of his type. I would like to see
more
Norton/Pitt collaborations in the future. In conclusion Fight Club is an
experience that no-one should miss. It is truly awesome.
