There is so much right and potential within this movie.  Edward Norton,
wonderful in &quot;Primal Fear&quot; and &quot;American History X.&quot;  Brad Pitt, awesome in
&quot;Seven&quot; amongst other films.  And David Fincher, a modern day genius of
film.<br /><br />The photography and overall theme, and tone of this story is nothing less
than fascinating, and at the same time, intruiging.<br /><br />It's the words that are said by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt make you stop
and think.  The violence this film exudes makes you wonder and shake your
head.<br /><br />That said, there's one big flaw in this film, the pacing and that's why I
gave it only an 8 out of 10
