When I see the rating of &quot;Fight club&quot; I was very surprised...Well from
then I watch the movie 4,may be 5
times.Brilliant,incredible,topping,some of the words to describe&quot;Fight
club&quot;.Edward Norton and Brad Pitt were great,David Fincher is very good
director,but the thing I love the most in this movie is the character
of Brad Pitt-Tyler Durden,his just the man. Hi doesn&#39;t have any
fears,love the confidence,intelligence and everything in him.The sense
of &quot;Fight club&quot; is very deep,you have to be smart to understand it,to
be honest I really like to be the same,to be a part of a organization
that can change the world.Yeah I know a have very big imagination,but
what the hell I love the movie!!!
