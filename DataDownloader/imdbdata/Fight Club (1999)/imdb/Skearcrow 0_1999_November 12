1999_November 12 

On the verge of the millennium every single person has this sick
pre-millennium tension going on and every filmmaker and manufacturer is
trying to cash in on it. This is the first movie to address that without
once mentioning the great clock change. A movie at once brutally
disgusting,
harshly confusing, and mentally disturbing yet still so beautiful you can
watch it with the sound off. David Fincher brings the visual media to a
whole new level and challenges the viewer to be more aware of the
cinematic
surroundings.
