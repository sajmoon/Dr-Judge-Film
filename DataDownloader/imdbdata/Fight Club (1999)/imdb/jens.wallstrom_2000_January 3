This movie does strange things to you. At first I understood and admired
Tyler. The he was starting to slip, and I slipped with him. I don't know
when he passed the line, but I was right there with him. The twist and the
ending was superbe, I can't wait to see it again...<br /><br />And to everybody, this film is NOT about fighting. It's about something
else
(I don't really know what yet, but I'll might get there in a day or
two)
