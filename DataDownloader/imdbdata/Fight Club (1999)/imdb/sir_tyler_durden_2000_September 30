Fight Club was nothing short of outstanding. I could go on for hours about
it but won't. One thing that annoys me is when people say that it is
violent.  One person dies in this film.  Also, some people didn't really
catch what this movie is all about; some people just think it's a dark,
bloody, violent movie.  The movie has so many good points about this
generation.  It has so many good lines too, and every time I sit down to
watch any part of it, I just can't take my eyes off it, it's just so
interesting and well made.
I gave it a ten, my advice is to go rent it, or just go and buy it.
Especially on DVD.
