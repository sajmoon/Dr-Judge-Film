I could go on forever about this movie, but I won't.  The best complement I
can give it is: &quot;It is better than the book.&quot;  How many movies can you say
are better than the book it's based on?  I can count them on one hand. <br /><br />If anything, you must see the opening credits -- by far the greatest first 3
minutes of any movie ever!  And if you've seen the movie, how can you ever
forget the first line of the movie: &quot;People are always asking me if I know
Tyler Durden.&quot;  <br /><br />It's certainly not a movie for everyone -- only those who truly wish to
explore the reasons behind the disillusionment of modern society, and
ESPECIALLY how the role of the domesticated male fits in.<br /><br />Easily David Fincher's best movie -- although I'm also a huge fan of the
equally underrated &quot;The Game&quot; with Michael Douglas.
