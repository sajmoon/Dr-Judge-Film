I understand that a large portion of the audience viewing this film thinks
that it has something to do with fighting.  It does not.  Fighting is a
device the movie uses to explore deep truths about the male animal, his
basic nature, his need for leadership, in whatever form it takes, and the
power of the individual to create a unique reality for himself and any
disciples that happen along. (and there are always plenty.<br /><br />There is an unnerving and half realized terror rearing it's head in America
today.  We have real, concrete choices to make if we just had the nerve to
admit the truth and take the chances. This films pushes the point to
excess.
Live it small or live it large.  It's each of our choices.  Given a lot of
intelligence, some serious personality skills, and just enough psychosis to
make it interesting, we can all be our own god.<br /><br />A visually inspired, almost perfect film, but you can't really know this
unless you've seen it at least twice.<br /><br />
