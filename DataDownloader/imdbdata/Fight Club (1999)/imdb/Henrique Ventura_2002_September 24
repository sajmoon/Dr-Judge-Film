Basically, Edward Norton represents a slave of the current consumist society
we live in, a guy who buys all kinds of material goods that you order by
phone only; who has a office job in a corrupt car company. We have the kind
of person that all the big corporations want people to
be.
And then we have Tyler Durden, which represents what someone like the
narrator would want to be and do but can never find the courage to be; the
guy who works at night doing things we need but nobody cares who's doing it
(or how it's done).<br /><br />This movie strikes every single bad capitalist thing in society! The Fight
Club is like a refuge, where people can get away from society and unleash
their fury against society on someone else. <br /><br />You'll definitely see the world in a different way after you see Fight Club,
I can assure you that. This movie would have probably received an award, if
it wasn't for the violence, but that's what Fight Club is all about: being
different.
