2001_June 6 

This is my absolute favorite movie.  The social commentaries in this
male-driven movie were so true, and as a female, I was not offended nor
disgusted by the violent scenes.  What 'Tyler Durden' made me realize is
that I am a member of a brainless, superficial, materialistic society.
For
example, 'Jack' believed himself to be complete because he had a designer
wardrobe, nice Scandinavian furniture, and a stable (yet awful) career,
yet
he could not sleep at night.  At the advice of a sadistic doctor, he
starts
attending help groups.  I don't want to give too much away, but the ending
is wonderful.
