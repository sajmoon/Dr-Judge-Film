2000_May 7 

This movie was hailed as a great movie by those who understood it. those
with simple minds looked at this as nothing more than a violent guy movie
but those with minds see the nihilistic themes for generation xers.  others
who want all the luxuries of the horchow catalogue thought it was ucky.  It
is inspiring and gives hope to those of us who might never be millionares
or
rock stars or movie gods.  edward norton and brad pitt are at the top of
their form in a great thinking mans movie i give it a ten.
