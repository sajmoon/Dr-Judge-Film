&quot;Fight Club&quot; is a great film. It's the first film by David Fincher
where I have left the cinema feeling rather uplifted and happy, and
it's the first film by Fincher that I think is really, really good. It
starts right at the opening credits: it's probably the best opening
credits I have ever seen (yes, better than Se7en's).<br /><br />I had read Chuck Palahniuk's novel a couple of times before I saw the
film and I like it (the novel) even if it's far from a masterpiece.
Even though I like the book, the film is absolutely brilliant in its
own right. Jim Uhls's script is fantastic. The comedy is also great,
it's been a long time since I've laughed this much during a film. The
cinematography is great, the music is perfect for the film, the
dialogue is brilliant.<br /><br />The acting is, of course, top notch. Brad Pitt is often overlooked as
an actor because of the famous face and the famous body. This is a
shame, because I think he's a really good actor although this is the
first time I think he's great. Helena Bonham Carter is, surprisingly,
perfectly cast. I could see no other actress portraying Marla Singer.
Meat Loaf is good as well. I could go on and on about Edward Norton,
but that will probably bore you so let's just say that, even though
this isn't another Aaron Stampler- or Derek Vinyard mind-blowing
performance, he is an acting genius and that his performance in &quot;Fight
Club&quot; is brilliant.<br /><br />The production design is another thing that is worth mentioning as
something really good. As everybody will probably realise there is a
&quot;but&quot; here and it's coming now: there is sadly a rather boring part in
the film right before the brilliant last 10-15 minutes. It lasts for
about 20 minutes and it slows down the film and makes it rather
unbelievable (to those who have seen the film; I'm not referring to the
most apparent thing when I say that some of it is unbelievable). Well,
it's such a shame because if those twenty minutes had been more
concentrated or something I would without a doubt have given this film
a 10 here at IMDb. As it is now, I gave it an 9 after much
consideration. Very close to being *incredibly* brilliant, as it is now
&quot;Fight Club&quot; is &quot;only&quot; brilliant.
