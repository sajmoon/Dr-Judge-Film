This movie exposes with an intricate setting the conditionalism people are
willing to go in order to have a &quot;safe&quot;, controlled and expectable
life.<br /><br />Yet, when a release is offered in the form of an unofficial fight club,
thousands of people fed up with their dull, meaningless, and regular,
average lifes, there is no hesitation in moving to a more carefree if yet
violent life.<br /><br />It is an excellent film.
