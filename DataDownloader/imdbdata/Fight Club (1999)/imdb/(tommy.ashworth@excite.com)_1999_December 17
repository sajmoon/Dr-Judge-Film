1999_December 17 

This is one of those movies that you go see because you think it's gonna
have some cool fight scenes, which it does, but the plot is amazingly
engrossing. Nobody can really explain why this movie is so good, but you
have to see it anyway, and soon because it's almost gone. With all the
horrible movies that are around right now this is truly worth your
while.
