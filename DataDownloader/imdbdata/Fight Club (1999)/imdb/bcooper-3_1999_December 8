It's hard not to reveal plot points about this film because they are so
fantastic you need to talk about them.  Plot points aside, Fight Club may
have some of the funniest scenes I have ever seen in a movie.  Word to the
wise - pay attention to catch as much of this movie as you can.  There is
so
much you can't digest it in one viewing.
