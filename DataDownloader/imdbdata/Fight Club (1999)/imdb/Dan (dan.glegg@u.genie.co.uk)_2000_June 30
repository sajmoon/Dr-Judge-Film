After seeing Ed Norton in the fantastic and moving &quot;American History X,&quot; i
was very keen to see this film. I was not disappointed. Mixing in perfect
quantities of satire, mystery and shocking imagery, this film had me gripped
from the stunning intro sequence (the relevance of which only becomes clear
once you've seen the entire fiml) right through to the beautifully-sculpted
twist towards the end. forget the sixth sense. this film is a far better way
of spending your money.<br /><br />Edward Norton's constant inner monologue is both amusing and insightful, and
Pitt's character (Tyler) is just as mysterious as necessary.<br /><br />I'd give this film a definite 8 out of 10, and no film i've ever reviewed
has gotten more than 9.
