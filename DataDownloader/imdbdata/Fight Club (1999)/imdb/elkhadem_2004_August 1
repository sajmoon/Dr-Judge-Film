Fight Club is definitely one of the best movies of all time. The story
is so good and the on-screen outcome is executed dynamically that you
feel you are actually inside the movie seeing things for yourself. The
basic idea behind the film is that one is only a loser because he/she
doesn't tap into their abilities and take some positive steps in their
life.<br /><br />The 3 main characters are so colorful and well-performed so that you
believe them completely. What makes the movie unique is the amount of
energy you see on-screen and the shocking events that keep the movie's
pace very entertaining and interesting.<br /><br />This film has inspired so many people, I hear some crazy people started
Fight Clubs after they watched it.
