You might hear people saying that this film is &quot;absurd&quot;, or
&quot;pointless&quot;.  The people who say those things did not see far enough into
this movie.  Trust me on this, if you can take the mental energy to think
about a movie, you will LOVE Fight Club. There is not much to enjoy about
this movie if you are looking for a simple plot scattered with action and
violence.  Fight Club requires thought.  And if you can do that, you are in
for a great treat.<br /><br />It is sad that so many people will go into this movie looking for
mindless violence, and then come out dissatisfied.  Then they will tell
everyone not to see the movie because the story was dumb and it made no
sense. I suppose those people are not the ones who were meant to appreciate
Fight Club.<br /><br />Fight Club is a masterpiece and will be loved for years.  For anyone
who has not yet seen this movie, listen to me: Watch this movie with an
open
mind, and you will experience great things.<br /><br />
