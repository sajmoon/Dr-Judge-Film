You people I will never understand. Everyone who says this is a waste of
time, read! First off whoever thinks they want to start there own Fight
Club
or thought the fighting was &quot;cool&quot; missed the whole point. Then the people
who thought the movie was a heap of trash cause it was to preachy or what
ever. Well you missed the boat. I can't explain why but the movie is so
much
more. You people are just scratching the surface of this killer movie. I
never once to myself thought &quot;This would be cool if we really did it.&quot; Or
thought about fighting someone. If you think the movie was about fighting
you totally just thought of the title and went in to it one minded. I saw
this movie with a clear mind and was blown away. Watch again or for the
first time. You will be happy!
