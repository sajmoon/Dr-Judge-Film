Fight Club is a strange movie, but is somehow saved by fresh formula
and good performances. Many consider it the best of 1999. It isn't far
from it, but just not a classic like many consider. Plot: Edward Norton
plays an insomniac businessman. He encounters soap salesman Tyler
Durden, who takes the businessman in after his home is destroyed. They
soon form &quot;fight club&quot;, a place where men find the pleasure of beating
the dirt out of each other. Soon, the club becomes too serious and out
of hand, as they start to cause murders. Who is causing this? Fight
Club is a very difficult movie to understand, it is told segment by
segment as the narrator (Norton) leads us into a great climax. Norton's
name is never revealed, but there is a good purpose. Pitt gives good
humorous scenes and the movie leads in the direction that I was
expecting. Fight Club is flawed in some ways, but is still very
thought-provoking and interesting.<br /><br />8/10 stars.
