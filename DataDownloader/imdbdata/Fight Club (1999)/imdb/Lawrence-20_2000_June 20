I cannot believe so many people rated this a 10. I did not think this film
was that grotesque. It had a dark mood and a dark message but it isn't
that
bad in regards to being gross. The fight scenes aren't that gross. The
film
was great, but not a 10. The film's style, mood, acting and story are all
pretty great. Although I felt the narrative was a little accessive at
times.
The pace is OK, but I actually though if anything more cuts could have
been
made.  All in all, a solid entertaining film, not a '10' but probably an
'8'.
