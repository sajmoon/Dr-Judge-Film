2000_September 1 

I was so lucky to see this film at press-screening and was immediately
blown
away by it...
The film has a unique blend of facts, supernaturalism, violence, romance
and
(very) black humor.
The acting from both Pitt and Norton are superb, but never have I been so
impressed with the directing from David Fincher. He handles the morale and
backbone of this film so carefully, that we can't help but get involved
with
the characters weird minds.<br /><br />I myself have, ever since &quot;Se7en&quot; and &quot;The Game&quot;, been a great fan of
Fincher and are constantly following his career to see what he comes up
with
next. This one was no exception at all!<br /><br />A great film about the future, by a director with a great
future.<br /><br />
