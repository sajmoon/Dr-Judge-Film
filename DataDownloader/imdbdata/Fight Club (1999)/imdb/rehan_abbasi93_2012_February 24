2012_February 24 
After getting tired of the crap that had been coming out of Hollywood
for a past year or so,I decided to give old movies a chance. I
thoroughly enjoyed the Matrix and Lord of the rings trilogies.Then,I
stumbled upon Fight Club.The thought of two men starting a club to help
vent male aggression didn&#x27;t impress me much. After all,what could
possibly be special about this to give this movie a rating of 8.8 on
IMDb. I dimmed the lights and cranked the volume up.From the
beginning,something felt right. There was an indescribable feeling in
Edward Norton&#x27;s voice over that agreed with me. Like his character, I
too was tired of the day to day routine,the same crap that we do
everyday and the petty things that we are made to run after in everyday
life. Like him,I too despised that are minds were controlled through
commercials and advertisements by corporations to keep us buying crap
that we probably don&#x27;t ever need. Another thing came poring over
through me and that was the supposed significance of having names like
Calvin Klein, Armani etc on your garments. A shirt should be a shirt
whether it has cK written on it should not make a difference. As the
movie progressed, feelings of rebellion grew in me. I wanted to leave
everything and fight against the present system. Fighting against these
urges ,I controlled myself with great difficulty. I didn&#x27;t care much
about the end, as the film had delivered beyond my wildest expectations
This movie made me a fan of David Fincher. Also Brad Pitt,who I thought
was successful due to just his pretty face, elevated in respect in my
mind. One of the top 3 films as far as I&#x27;m concerned
