1999_November 1 

I'm no real movie critic, but I enjoyed this movie and found some powerful
truth in it. Look at the scene where Tyler lets himself be beaten by the
bar
owner. He's clearly enjoying it. With the consumerist/materialist focus on
the self, this is the way in which the self can be denied. There might be
the work of id, ego, and super ego going on here (which would necessitate
Marla), but I'm not quite sure. Anyway, this is probably the scene that
helped me understand the ending, how the two came one by means of such
violence. Rather Zen in a way. Amazing how two such philosophical movies
(as
far as I've seen) that have a great share of violence are made in the same
year (this and The Matrix). Perhaps this is saying something about society
in this time.
