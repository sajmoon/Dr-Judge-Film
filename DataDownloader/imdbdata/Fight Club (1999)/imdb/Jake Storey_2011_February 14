So It&#x27;s been 12 years since this movie came out, and I&#x27;ve finally
gotten around to watching it. Given I was seven when it came out so the
content would&#x27;ve been unsuitable. Still I&#x27;ve heard for years how good
this movie, heard all the memorable quotes, everything that sort of
surrounds a cult film like this. So I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how
disappointing this film is. One thing to remember before watching the
film is that it&#x27;s not about fighting, so don&#x27;t even expect a few cheap
thrills from the action, cause the fisticuffs are short, few, and far
between. Yeah it&#x27;s a metaphor for the male role in modern society, what
a rip off.<br /><br />It&#x27;s crap masquerading as intellectual, and important, but really it&#x27;s
just burying itself in grit and violence, and tricking you all into
thinking it&#x27;s a smart film, just because it&#x27;s dark and misanthropic
nature. Don&#x27;t get me wrong a dark and gritty film can be excellent,
however Fight Club doesn&#x27;t deliver anything but sloppy, bloody punches.
It&#x27;s well shot, and the acting is good, but it&#x27;s just completely devoid
of entertainment. Setting aside the fact that it&#x27;s one of the most
depressing films I&#x27;ve had the displeasure of seeing, where 90% of the
dialogue is Norton whining about his petty problems, and then going
about like a total ponce and faking real problems to get attention.
Somehow I&#x27;m supposed to care about this character? He&#x27;s a douche, an
unsympathetic, pathetic, boring douche, not the everyman that this
movie thinks he is. The protagonist isn&#x27;t this film&#x27;s only flaw, it&#x27;s
arrogant, and pretentious, and has this twisted view of the world which
it has deluded itself into believing everyone else shares.<br /><br />In short this is a popular film, and you will probably like it more
than me, especially if you&#x27;ve got a taste for the realistic and seedier
side of film making, but please don&#x27;t just be like swarms of other
people and actually view this film objectively, rather than just going
in and getting psyched because of it&#x27;s cult status, and basically
tricking yourself into thinking you like it. It&#x27;s a movie that tries to
make you think, but unfortunately few do, please think about the
content. Now I just wish that my first IMDb review weren&#x27;t a negative
one.
