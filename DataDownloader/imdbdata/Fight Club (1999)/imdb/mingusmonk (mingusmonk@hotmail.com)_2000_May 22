I watched End Of Days directly after this disjointed feature and the
Ah'nold
piece came out looking like The Godfather!<br /><br />There was a lot of talk when Alien3 came out that David Fincher's
limitations as a music video/commercial director would hamper the film's
presentation.  I was pleasantly surprised that this ended up not being the
case.  Apparently he has decided to devolve into that predicted
state.<br /><br />This film was not a bad idea and the acting was good (with what was
provided) so that leaves us with the presentation being the problem.  The
focus of the film was very disjointed.  The dialogue was vague and an
seemed
to try too hard and coming up with the next big quotable.  And the
cinematography was .... well ... Fincher - if you're going to roll a film
that is so colorless, just make it black and white!<br /><br />I'd love to see them remake this movie with some different direction -
there
was some real potential in it.
