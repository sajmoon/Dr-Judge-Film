In my idea the best movie ever made in history of Hollywood, I did not see
all hollywood movies but I can guess that my idea is TRUE. You have to watch
this movie at least 2 or 3 times to understand and see some scenes,tips and
events.I watched &quot;Fight Club&quot; 4 times and every time I found and saw new
things  and I'm sure if I watch it again I will find some other new thing. I
suggest Fight Club to everyone<br /><br />
