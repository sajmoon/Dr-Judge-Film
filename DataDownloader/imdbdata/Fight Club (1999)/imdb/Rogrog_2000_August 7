2000_August 7 

To be honest, I'm not sure what to make of this film, I can't seem to make
up my mind is it something truly unique, or just a rehashing of a series of
good  ideas put together.  The film itself starts out interestingly enough,
yet slows down toward the middle and end, until the final 15 minutes, which
runs at a frantic rate (which it should, to illustrate the lead characters
revelations about himself).  I'm not sure what kind of people to recommend
this movie to, it doesn't in my mind belong to any preset genre, and I there
fore find it hard to compare to anything.  Overall, I believe I enjoyed the
experience of watching this film, though I am hesitant to say on what
grounds.<br /><br />The ending alone warrants a good review, and thus I give it 8 of
10.
