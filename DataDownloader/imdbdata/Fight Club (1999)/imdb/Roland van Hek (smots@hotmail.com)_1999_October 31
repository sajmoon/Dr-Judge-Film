Fincher has done it again. After &quot;SE7EN&quot; and &quot;THE GAME&quot; he has created a
true cinematographical tour the force that will set your head reeling,
commenting on consumerism, post-modernism, society's infatuation with
violence and modern society, to name a few.....<br /><br />Do NOT visit this film expecting to view some tough action flick about guys
beating eachother to a pulp. This is one hell of a multi-layered, intense
movie.<br /><br />LOVED IT.
