Fight Club is about everything you could hope for in a film.Edward Norton
yet again gives another AAA(and unfortunately overlooked...)performance,
along with another one of the finest modern actors of today, Brad
Pitt.Great
dialogue, great acting, and a superb twist make Fight Club a must for
anyone
with depth and an open mind.<br /><br />Despite a couple of minor flaws, Fight Club is a very well done
adaptation,
let alone movie.9/10
