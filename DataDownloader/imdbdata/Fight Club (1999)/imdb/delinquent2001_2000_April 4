2000_April 4 

This movie is just the most amazing movie i have ever seen.
The action just does not stop throughout the whole movie and never gets
boring not even for a minute! This  movie is so pumping and makes you say
YEAH!!!! Just after you finish watching fight club you'll wanna see it
again
and again. This movie seems to have everything. At first look at the
trailer
you think the movie to be just a mindless bloodfest movie, but after
watching the movie you realise that the trailer only gave away the first
20
minutes of the movie or less.
All in all the most pumping movie ever and it deserves much attention,
even
though the bloody old farts at the Academy Awards didnt seem to think so
(only getting 1 nomination and that was for sound) its about time they got
some new people to review the movies for Academy Award Nomination. Anyway
nuff said everyone go out and see if for yourself 10/10.
