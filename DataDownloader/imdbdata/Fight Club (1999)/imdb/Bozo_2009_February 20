The first rule of Fight Club is to not talk about Fight Club...but it&#39;s
hard to follow when the movie is this good.<br /><br />Some movies follow the basic psychological structure of every day
people, however, Fight Club takes you to corners of your imagination
that you were too afraid to even get close to.<br /><br />The plot? Very simple yet complicated. A man meets the man of his
dreams and together they put together a way for men to relieve stress,
its called Fight Club and the name of it says it all, they just fight.
However that is only the crust of this very thick plot. I would dive
more into it but you&#39;ll have to watch to find out.<br /><br />The acting was first class. Edward Norton was flawless as The Narrator,
the man who goes through his unsatisfying life wishing he could do
something exceptional. Brad Pitt was perfect as Tyler Durden, the man
of the Narrator&#39;s dreams who helps the Narrator pull himself and his
ideas/dreams together. Helena Bonham Carter was exceptional as Marla
Singer, the crazy/gritty/disgusting woman who seems to be a burden on
The Narrator. Meat Loaf delivered an otherwise award-winning
performance as Bob, the physically and mentally deformed man who is so
disgusting yet lovable.<br /><br />The plot had more twists and knots than an old rope. However, they all
worked in the end, giving us one of the best films in recent cinematic
history.<br /><br />10/10.
