This movie should be seen by everyone. It should be manditory viewing in
high school like THE OUTSIDERS and RUMBLE FISH were. It could really change
your life. Solid performances and excellent filmatography will hold the
interest of even the most superficial automaton our society can produce. But
this film has a message and if you get it, you know its true ands it will
stick with you.
