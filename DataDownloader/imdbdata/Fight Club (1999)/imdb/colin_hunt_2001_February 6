Absolutely brilliant film. Before I borrowed the video, I thought it was  a
film about fisty cuffs and head bashing as the title suggest.  However,
Edward Nortons chillingly realistic portrayal of a 30's something white
collar worker living and working in a modern city environment does bring
home parallels to the frustrations most of us feel.  Critics often write of
the irresponsible attitude and subversive nature of the film but I only
feel
it highlights the problems associated with modern lifestyles that most
self-appointed morally responsible people would prefer to quietly brush
under the carpet.
