David Fincher hates consumerism. So much so that he has made a movie about a
cabal of emasculated urban males who find solace from it by smashing each
other's faces in. From the film's opening sequence (a roller coaster-esque
ride through the interior of male genitalia) to the blow it all up ending,
FIght Club is bleak; and I do mean BLEAK. But I loved it. Ignore all the
hype the studio has placed around this flick so that everyone calls it
&quot;CONTROVERSIAL!&quot; This not a movie about violence itself (i.e. Natural Born
Killers, Clockwork Orange). Fight Club is about the dementia that instigates
mayhem. The movie raises so many questions about itself (i.e. when reality
begins and ends), that I've found myself pondering three days after the
credits rolled. For those who like thought with their story.
