I have to save that this film is entertaining to watch and can be seen
multiple times. To me, the twist in the film wasn&#x27;t a shock. This film
is meant to be shocking and a revolution even in the minds of the
general public. This film could be used to examine society where men
get together and perform fights in order to prove themselves. The fight
club becomes one man&#x27;s obsession and way of life even leading to
anarchy, destruction, and illegal activities trying to break away from
the dread of life itself. The narrator played by Ed Norton is played
brilliantly. He comes across as the average every guy in a dead end
job, unhappy, miserable, and seeking a purpose in life by going to
support groups for diseases and conditions that he doesn&#x27;t have in
life. It is Helena Bonham Carter&#x27;s chain smoking character, Marla
Singer, that comes into his life to further cause havoc and
destruction. He needs reality of others but not another fake member
like Singer in his groups to convey his need of belonging and self
worth. I could go on but I think you get it. Brad Pitt does also a fine
job in his role. The script has some holes in it but it&#x27;s well done and
entertaining.
