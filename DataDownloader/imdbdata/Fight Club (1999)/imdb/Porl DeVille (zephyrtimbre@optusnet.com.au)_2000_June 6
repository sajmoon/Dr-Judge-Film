It seems quite fitting that during the opening credits of Fight Club the
audience is taken on a tour of the human cranial organ. This is the ideal
introduction to the gritty journey of a man who is trying to come to terms
with his own impending self destruction. Gritty being the key word of
course, for this film is grungy and darkly funny. Some of the ideas it
seductively thrusts into your head you will find yourself grinning and
agreeing with - I can easily see why this film has upset some of the more
conservative (IKEA shopping?) punters out there. When it comes to
freedom-sapping or or &quot;rat-race&quot; lifestyle choices Fight Club does not
pull
any punches. Brad Pitt &amp; Edward Norton give amazing performances and are
supported by equally amazing supporting roles from Helena Bonham Carter
(finally outside of her &quot;period piece&quot; typecasting) and Meatloaf (who
quite
frankly needs some underwire support!)
My advice is to disobey the first rule of Fight Club - tell everybody
about
Fight Club...
