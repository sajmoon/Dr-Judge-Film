Wow!  It's hard to know what to think about this movie.  It's got great
visuals -- Fincher is the master of the dark.  The dialogue is great,
especially the funny and ironic narration provided in voiceover by Edward
Norton, who gives another knockout performance (no pun intended).  Brad Pitt
is back in great form too.  And Helena Bonham Carter, whom I had only seen
in Merchant-Ivory type stuff, is a revelation here, though her part is not
too well drawn.  The hilarious scenes where Norton, out of boredom, makes
the rounds of various 12-step groups are worth the price of admission.  The
fight club premise of the movie is interesting at the start -- in the line
of angry white male movies that started with &quot;Falling Down&quot; -- but it goes
over the edge toward the end and it's not clear if this is drama, satire,
fantasy, or comedy.  Then comes an absurd plot twist that pulls the rug out
from under the whole movie -- the worst ending since Kevin Costner in &quot;No
Way Out.&quot;  Still, the movie has many pleasures and it's a joy to see Fincher
at work -- he seemed to have so much fun making this movie that he can
barely be contained by the medium.  (The self reference to movies are among
the pleasures.  It's the first movie I've seen that points out the little
signal for the projectionist to change reels.  I also liked the &quot;little
flashback humor.&quot;)
