Firstly let me start of by saying I totally didn&#39;t like this film when
it was first released in 1999. I thought it to be pointless, boring,
confusing and there wasn&#39;t enough fighting in it to justify the title.<br /><br />Then again I was a very, very stupid 11 year old with a small mind and
a couple of years later I watched it again and was in awe of what I
saw. This film is one of my top 5 to say the least, everything about it
just works so well its beautiful to watch.<br /><br />The characters are fantastic, intriguing and brilliantly acted by two
of the most under appreciated actors around in Brad Pitt and Ed Norton;
the two are brilliant as they are so contrasting but at the same time
the chemistry between them is palpable which draws you towards them
even more.<br /><br />Simply shot with no head hurting panoramic artistic wide frames or
abstract shots which makes the film as a whole seem so linear... until
the twist which just gives this film something so magic it can&#39;t really
be analysed or explained.<br /><br />Enough babble, in summary Fight Club is top notch and does over most of
the processed crap which comes out in the cinema month after month! If
you haven&#39;t seen it you should!!!!
