First off I think Fight Club is a weird Movie. It Had some of its Moments
But They are very few. Edward Norton Did an Awesome Job as the Narrarator
and The Main Character, Brad Pitt on the Other Hand Seemed to be Redoing His
Psycho 12 Monkeys Personality. The Movie Had Sort of a Split
Personality/Where's Waldo Kind of Thing To it. Strangely, The Best Part of
The Movie is This: In The Beginning of The Movie When The Narrarator
Supposedly Has Insomnia, Push The Slow Button on your VCR. Brad Pitt will
appear in Many Frames of The Movie For a Split Second. That's What Makes it
Where's Waldo-ish. Finally, Fight Club is a cool if you wanna Play The &quot;Spot
Brad Pitt&quot; Game as For Entertainment It Doesn't Give you Enough in The Long
Run.
