Alot seems too have been written about this movie already! Which, I
suppose,
would please Mr Fincher whatever the content of those words.<br /><br />And perhaps that's the whole point about this film. It's not necessarily
about any single topic.... male isolation, mental illness, violence, a
sense
of belonging etc etc..read all the possible and probable 'messages' that
this film delivers elsewhere. This film is designed to make you
THINK.<br /><br />If you don't want to think, fine, I too like to watch Bruckheimer's
rubbish
for pure entertainment. But if you want to walk away feeling  &quot;Wow, I
truly
have seen a masterpiece &quot;, then see it!<br /><br />You don't have to 'get it'. Don't feel lost if you think you ARE lost in
the
plot! Just wallow in it. Movies like this happen rarely.<br /><br />Watch it twice, three times. (The impression is still there for me.) This
is
simply one of the best movies ever conceived and delivered.
