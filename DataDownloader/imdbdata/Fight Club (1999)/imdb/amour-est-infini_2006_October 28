This movie is of such proportions that every time I watch it, I am more
and more amazed. I watch it all the time. I am astounded by the
presence of relevant philosophy and meaning. The screen shots are
gorgeous as well as the camera work and effects. The music is
phenomenal - I have and listen to the soundtrack frequently. Both David
Fincher and Chuck Phalanuik are absolute geniuses. I haven&#39;t read the
book, but I will! This movie beautifully directed and acted. Brad Pitt
and Edward Nornton are stunning. This movie is an epic for the ages!
Anyone can see it and appreciate it. It is without a doubt one of the
most spectacular movies available to the public.
