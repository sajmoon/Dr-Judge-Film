When I first sae this movie (at the cinema four years ago) I understood why
it caused so much discussions worldwide. There is a little of everything in
&quot;Fight Club&quot;: violence, love, humour, adventure, action and fantasy. It also
has a little of art in here, once the actors talk directly to us while the
movies goes on. <br /><br />The first minutes are a bit of confusing and they are not so attractive.
However, after we get in the mood of this masterpiece, we enjoy what we see,
but not the way great director David Fincher wanted us to. I conclude this
due to the great surprise we discover in the end... and what a
surprise!<br /><br />Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, two of everybody's favourite actors are very
well in this film. They make us believe in their roles and their characters
are powerful and real. <br /><br />Highly recommended film!<br /><br />my rate 9/10
