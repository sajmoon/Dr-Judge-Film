Fightclub is an absolutely amazing film.For me,it symbolizes the
philosophical view of anarchism,political egoism and mainly nihilism.<br /><br />We live in the consuming epoch(SOAP).Fightclub is the way to confront the
world,relieving your anger. Furthermore it symbolizes all minority political
groups like the anarchist or even the fashists (MAYHEM). Generally all
partions of people that are against the mass culture using violence.this is
the first picture of the movie.RESIST! But Fightclub being a place where the
person meets the team,we have the most common DISTORTION of the original
ideas.Fightclub becomes another big &quot;alternative&quot; mass movement (like gothic
etc).therefore it loses its original cause and purpose like all political or
philosophical movements did.for example there is great difference between
the anarchist views of bakhunin,the ideas of the people that distorted his
thought(the mass group of anarchists) and the way those put their ideas on
action(third phase distortion). this is what this movie is talking about.ITS
AGAINST ALL SPIRIT OF PARTNERSHIP,GROUPIVITY.On another parallel it talks
about the distortion in your mind.you begin something and it becomes
something else.ALWAYS.therefore I believe its a  pure NIHILISTIC film,and I'
m a great fun of the nihilistic theory.There were occasions that after the
film young fools started kicking cars and that kind of stuff.this is exactly
what this film talks about.distortion of everything through the mass
intervenience of the fools.In the end this film has nothing to suggest (and
thats good) except simple values that really make our lives beautiful (like
love when everything is falling apart at the end of the movie).Also that the
greatest revolutions take part in our brains.Not with violence.revolution is
a matter of freedom.freedom is a result of being able to think.I think
therefore I am free.I' ve seen this movie 6 times...
10/10
