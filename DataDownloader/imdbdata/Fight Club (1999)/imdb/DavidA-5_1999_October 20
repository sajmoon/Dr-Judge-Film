1999_October 20 

Before I begin my comment on this film, I must say without hesitation that
Edward Norton is probably one of the best actors I have seen in MANY years.
I thought Brad Pitt's performance in this movie was equally excellent.
However,this movie confused me quite thoroughly until I sat down and thought
through it a few hours later. I think this movie is one that the movie lover
will need to watch several times over to pick up all of the little
&quot;messages&quot; given throughout the body of this film. Before I close I must
also say that Helena Bonham-Carter was truly wonderful and convincing in her
role as well.
While this is not really my favorite type of movie (a bit too violent for my
taste) I enjoyed it. On a scale of 1-10 I give Fight Club a bloody
7.
