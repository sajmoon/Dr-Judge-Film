Fight Club was a catharsis for me in some ways. This movie is about not
depending on the way society is taking things in these days. Pitt and
Edwards have this chemistry you will enjoy from the start to the end. I
hated Fincher for Alien 3 - one of my favorite sagas - but SE7EN and FIGHT
CLUB are American Modern Day Masterpieces. The cinematic way it's done will
leave you breathless. There are a lot of things to catch in this film. But
what am I saying you have probably already seen it, so enjoy it again. It's
worth the price.
