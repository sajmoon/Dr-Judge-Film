Arguably one of the best made films to emerge in the last five years,
Fight
Club sets out to challenge the capitalist, materialistic society the
Western
world has created. While certainly surprising, although with enough clues
along the way to tip you off, the much-hyped twist at the end is not as
important as the underlying message, which aims to show that mankind is
tricked into the desire for fashionable yet entirely useless designer
goods.
The story revolves around the campaign of an ever-growing terrorist
organisation who seek to free the common man from the tyranny of
consumerism
and credit card companies. It's gripping, too, as we see the actions of
the
protagonists grow from petty vandalism to full-scale terrorism and beyond,
and wonder just how the hell it will end until we come to the final twist,
when events have spiraled out of control and are seemingly beyond the
reach
of the main character.  Although comical at times, there does seem to be a
serious message below the increasingly silly terrorist plots, a suggestion
that we are indeed letting ourselves be tricked into thinking that the
purchase of material goods is all there is in life. The performances of
all
involved are excellent, even Meatloaf, and the effects are stunning in
places. Perhaps David Fincher's best film so far, it is very well directed
throughout. It deserves your attention, and it deserves to be listened to.<br /><br />Don't just see this as another gratuitously violent hollywood film, it's
so
much more than men bare-knuckle fighting in a basement.
