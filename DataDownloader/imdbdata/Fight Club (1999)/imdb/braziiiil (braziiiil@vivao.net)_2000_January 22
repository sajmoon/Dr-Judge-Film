I dont often say this about a movie...in fact only 5 films have deserved
my
10/10 vote, this is one!<br /><br />Brad Pitt in possibly his finest ever role ( My girlfriend agreed, mmm)
This
film has absolutely everything and will keep you thinking for about a
month
after seeing it. But I musnt say any more because remember &quot;first rule of
fight club is that you tell no-one about fight club&quot;
