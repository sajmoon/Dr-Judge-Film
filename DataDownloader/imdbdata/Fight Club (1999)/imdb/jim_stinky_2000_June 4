young kids for years will be renting and watching this movie.  just like i
grew up renting and watching the wall, a clockwork orange, and stuff like
that.  this movie is great the first time and then a totally different
movie
every time after that since you get to watch for things that mess it up.
i
can't find any yet.  excellent movie.  definitely a worthy dvd purchase
word
