This movie deserves a 10 from everyone no doubt. This is a movie one
can watch 5 million times and not get sick of. There are so many
different layers to this film its unbelievable. Also, this movie has
quotes that one can live by. Personally, this is my favorite film of
all time and I am sure I am not alone. Edward Norton is a genius along
with Brad Pitt who is one of the only &quot;hot&quot; guy actors who is any good.
Someday this film will be a classic so why not give higher votes
now!!!! If anyone feels this way about this movie tell me. We need to
get this movie higher up in the top 100. I don't care what anyone says
but this movie should be ahead of lord of the rings any day. peace
