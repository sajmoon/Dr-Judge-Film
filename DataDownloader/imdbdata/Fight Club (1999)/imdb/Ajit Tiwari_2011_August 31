I think this is one of the best mystery-thriller movie ever made in the
world. It is strange dark and subtle, has every component of a great
cinema.<br /><br />A person challenges to his sanity and insanity concurrently, one can
reveal one&#x27;s abnormal sensitivity to stimulation himself. &#x22;There is a
fine line between reality and fiction&#x22; this movie elaborates the
sentence. A person can go to any length in order to achieve his goals.
You will be forced to maintain the complete attention because you are
simply fascinated.<br /><br />Edward Norton gives an outstanding performance as an insomniac and
perplexed protagonist. Brad Pitt is charismatic as he possesses an
extraordinary ability to attract. Helena Bonham Carter has done a
fabulous job (&#x22;Dr Jekyll and Mr Jack Ass&#x22;). Rest of the gang of the
fight club is just fantastic.<br /><br />David Fincher has crafted this movie so finely which is spellbinding
until the mystery open after &#x22;Seven&#x22;, &#x22;The game&#x22; and &#x22;Insomnia&#x22;.<br /><br />Tyler Durden: &#x22;People do it everyday, they talk to themselves... they
see themselves as they&#x27;d like to be, they don&#x27;t have the courage you
have, to just run with it&#x22;.<br /><br />It is one of my all time favorite movie, loved watching this every now
and then.
