I want to start off by saying that fight club is one of the best films
that
I have seen in quite a long time.  Topped by such classics as Pulp Fiction
and Reservoir dogs, this film still delivers the viewer with quite an
interesting and amazing movie going experience.  Norton's performance,
while
mostly done in narration, is incredible and tops his performence in
American
History X.  Brad Pitt seems perfect for the role of Tyler Durden,
embodying
everything the book version of Tyler seemed to have.  I've seen this movie
about 15 times and I have to say that every time I see it I find something
I
like even more than what I liked earlier.  Overall, SEE THIS MOVIE you
wont
regret it!
