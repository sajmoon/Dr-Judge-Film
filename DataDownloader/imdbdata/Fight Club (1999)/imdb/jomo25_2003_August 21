Edward Norton plays the nameless narrator whose life radically changes when
Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) enters his life.  Norton plays a character who
can't sleep and finds respite in the many groups that help people tackle
cancer or give up smoking.  He meets Marla, a creature just as dependent on
those support groups as he is.<br /><br />Tyler Durden's arrival turns Norton's world upside down as he highlights how
consumerist and pointless his life has become.  They lash at each other and
find violence eases their dissatisfaction with the world.  Others join them
as fight clubs emerge across the country.  Tyler and Norton's character come
to believe that they can take the dissatisfaction and help change the world
and they develop something called Project Mayhem.  But Norton begins doubt
Tyler and becomes troubled by Tyler's origins.<br /><br />It's easy to see why this movie has become popular with heterosexual males
from late teens to early thirties.  It's an expression of discontent with
modern life, challenging expectations, capturing adolescent and middle-aged
angst and distilling it into a movie put together with great panache and
flair.<br /><br />Norton and Pitt give showy performances typical of their work.  Pitt is
clearly trying to break away from the pretty boy image established by A
River Runs through It and Thelma and Louise.  Bonham Carter, similarly, is
attempting to change her prim Edwardian image (A Room with a View, The Wings
of the Dove) for something more shocking.<br /><br />It's an exercise in style with its flashy editing and obvious special
effects.  It's probably Fincher's best film to date but the points it makes
are hypocritical.  One scene encapsulates this: Pitt and Norton look at an
advertisement and ask whether this is how a real man is supposed to look. 
But this is exactly how both Pitt and Norton appear; it is the image movies
like Fight Club perpetuate; it's the ideal that movies like this reinforce. 
Pretentious and glossy entertainment.
