Fight Club is without a doubt in my top 5 movies of all time. Thethemes
and events in the film are indescribable.<br /><br />Also, this is one of the few films that has PERFECT actors for its
characters.<br /><br />Edward Norton is frighteningly convincing as the narrator, and Brad
Pitt plays the incredibly strange character of Tyler Durden absolutely
flawlessly.<br /><br />If you haven&#x27;t already seen this movie, I would strongly recommend it.
Gentlemen, fasten your seat-belts... <br /><br />Welcome to FIGHT CLUB!
