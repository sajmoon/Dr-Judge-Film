When I first saw Fight Club, in the theatre, I was confused by all the
things going on as subplots and side issues. I
really came to appreciate the movie after my second viewing. What I came to
realize is that this movie had something to offer that wasn't for everyone:
the blatent and underlying truths. The movie is very true, all of the things
about life, the world, people. Don't get caught up in the violence, if you
dislike it understand why you do so.  If only for the violence watch it
again for the content.  It is a great movie with something real to say, a
rarity in this age.
