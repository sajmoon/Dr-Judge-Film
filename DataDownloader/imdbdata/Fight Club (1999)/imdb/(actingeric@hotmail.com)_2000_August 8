I have so much to say about this film that I don't know where to start.
First of all it is not an action movie, like some previews made it out to
be. It is a smart dark comedy. I truly believe Fight Club is one of the
greatest films of all time. All aspects of it are superb. The acting by
the
entire cast is flawless (especially the main three). The directing is
revolutionary. The score makes it flow perfectly. The cinematography is
breath taking. And the outstandingly smart, intriguing, intricate, and
mind
boggling story makes it worth every minute. This film challenges you. It
makes you look at your life and what you value. The character of Tyler
Durden (Pitt) has a valid point, but it is up to the viewer to decide when
to stop `listening to what Tyler says.' Rent this movie if you want you
want
to have an experience that won't soon forget. And remember...&quot;THIS IS YOUR
LIFE AND IT'S ENDING ONE MINUTE AT A TIME.&quot;
