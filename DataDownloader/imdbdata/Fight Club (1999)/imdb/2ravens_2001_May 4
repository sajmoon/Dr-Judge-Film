I have rented this movie so many times and cant seem to get it back on
time
because I watch it so much.  I can watch it, rewind, and watch it again
easily in one sitting.  There are so many different things happening
thoughout the movie that it never gets boring.  Every time you watch it,
you
will see something cool that you missed the time before.<br /><br />Brad Pitt and Edward Norton have great &quot;buddy&quot; chemistry on screen!!<br /><br />I will always consider this movie one of my favorites.
