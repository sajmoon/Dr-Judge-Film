This is one of those movies that, for me, suggest that there is a lot that
is going on that if I don't get, it is my fault and not the
movie's.
I have a few friends who saw this and were just basically p***ed off by
their lack of understanding.  I was intrigued, excited, and felt like I
oughta buy the DVD someday to try it again.  Which I will do
soon.
