Fight Club is a rare movie.  It is one of those movies that stress the
anti-establishment movement in this country.  This movie can be taken many
ways.  Simplistically, it can be taken as a good story of a guy who hates
his job and tries to change it.  Dramatically and philosophically, it can
be
taken as a deeply moving movie.  The Narrator, played by Edward Norton, is
the poster boy for the Mass Market Consolidation of America.  He wears his
CK Shirts, his DKNY pants, and sleeps in his IKEA bed.  Throughout the
course of this movie, he eliminates all of his material possessions to shed
his human skin.  And then comes the Fight Club.<br /><br />Critics like Roger Ebert condemned Fight Club due to its `Graphic displays
of violence.'   I am forced to disagree.   While one might admit that the
fighting scenes might be a bit graphic for some people, it has its place in
the movie.  The fighting is a simplistic way of coming to terms with the
animal instincts that we are bred with. `It isn't about winning or losing,'
The Narrator states.  It isn't about trying to kill the other guy; it is
about releasing all of the emotions that we are forced to suppress.  After
a
hard fought battle, the 2 competitors embrace, and there are no ill
tempers.
The fighting is pure in essence, and is analogous to the Bible.  The 10
Commandments are similar to the Rules of Fight Club.  The 1st and 2nd rules
of Fight Club are, `Do not talk about Fight Club!'   The 3rd rule of Fight
Club is if someone taps out, goes limp, says I quit, the fight is over.
The
3rd rule is intact so people do not cause serious physical damage to each
other.    As the Commandments were made to secure the humanity in man, the
Rules of Fight Club were also meant to do the same.<br /><br />The Narrator, with the help of Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt, tries to
form his own reality.  He enlists people to commit acts of social
disobedience.  One can see these acts as petty and trivial.  Another can
see
these as acts against the establishment.  They desensitize all of the
movies
in blockbuster, they destroy a computer store, and they try to tear down a
local coffee shop.   The people trained to do this are like drones.  They
are taught not to think for themselves, and to do as they are told.  Robert
Paulsen, played by Meatloaf, says, `The 1st rule of Project Mayhem is you
do
not ask questions.'  Tyler Durden tells his minions, `You are not a
beautiful and unique snowflake.  You are the same piece of decaying matter
as the rest of us.'  This destruction of the human spirit has destroyed the
individualizing qualities that make man special.<br /><br />The Narrator is taught by Tyler to believe that to achieve success, one
must
hit rockbottom.  Not just thinking you are there, but actually being at
rockbottom.  Tyler explains, `What do you think hitting rockbottom is like
some kind of a switch that can be turned on or off at will?'  With this,
Tyler proceeds to put HCL Acid on The Narrator's wrist, which immediately
starts to dissolve.  When the ordeal is over, it leaves a burn scar all
over
The Narrator's wrist that will stay there forever.  Another case is when
Tyler starts to drive on the wrong side of the road.  He waits to see
whether The Narrator is going to try to take charge of the situation.
Tyler starts, `If you were to die now, would you be happy with your life?'
The Narrator responds, `No, get on the right side of the road.  All right,
what do you want to hear? I am not proud of my life.  I have nothing good
to
say about my life.'  Tyler reacts,  `Look at you, you're pathetic, just let
it go man, just let it go.'  After that, the car crashes, nearly killing
all
inside.  Rock bottom has just been hit.<br /><br />This movie is very powerful, down to the very end.  It has massive social
implications that apply to all human beings.  This movie stresses how we
are
becoming a commercialized culture that is constantly being desensitized to
all off the negative emotions that we experience.  Why should one care if
people in Somalia are starving, if we have our Kraft Macaroni and Cheese
and
are listening to the Backstreet Boys on our Sony Home Theatres?  Why should
one care if the animals in China are being abused and mistreated if we are
driving our Cadillac's with the roof down, with our children playing their
Gameboys and watching their movie on a portable DVD player.  This movie
shows us why we should care, and what will happen if people
don't.
