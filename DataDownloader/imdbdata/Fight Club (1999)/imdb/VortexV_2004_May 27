No film is perfect, that is what is so wisely sad before watching this
one. But I am afraid I will have to take that back. Of course it isn't
truly perfect but it is the nearest one in film history. And that 10 in
the rating is there to be given, so this is the first time I have given
a 10 on a film, and it is worth it. I watched the film because my
favorite actor (Edward Northon) was in it, and also Brat Pitt, who also
states on my list of great actors, played in it. There was no doubt
left, I had to see it. And I am so grateful I did. Everything of this
film is great, the acting, the story, the special effects, the sound
and the locations. Everything is as close to perfect as possible. For
the one's that seem to like this movie/film (I never got the
difference) just as much as I did, I must highly recommend Vannila sky,
American history X and 25th hour. And also the other way around, if you
liked one of the above stated films, you should see Fight Club.
