It is the best movie I have ever seen. The performance of the cast and
the direction is just so amazing that u will never know what to expect.
The jokes are funny. The movie is very entertaining and you cannot stay
without talking about it. It keeps you guessing till the end and most
of the people including me didn&#x27;t know what would come.<br /><br />You cannot say that a scene after brad pit&#x27;s entry was boring. But
appreciation not only goes to him but to all the other actors as well.
Both Brad pit and Edward Norton do a wonderful job and take the movie
to another level. I loved this movie the first time I watched it, now
i&#x27;ve seen it more than 6 times and i still love it and want to watch
it. The music was also good and the acting was the best. A must watch
movie!!!!
