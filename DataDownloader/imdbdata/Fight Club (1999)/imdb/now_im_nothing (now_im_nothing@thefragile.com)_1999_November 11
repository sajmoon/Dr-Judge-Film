Fight Club is a truly great film, in my opinion the best of the year
(1999).
This movie shows us something we haven't seen before. Based on Chuck
Palahniuk's novel, Fight Club is the depiction of how one man's search for
meaning in his life develops into a sort of fascist paranoia.<br /><br />While the movie looks rather simple (a bunch of guys fighting each other is
what the previews depict - they are VERY misleading), Fight Club is
anything
but simple. Mostly it is a vicious satire of consumerist society. We see
our
narrator, who identifies himself as Jack (played to perfection by Edward
Norton), trapped in a pointless existence revolving around buying furniture
and going to support groups. Then he meets Tyler Durden, who shows him how
to break free and give his life meaning. This meeting will change his life
forever.<br /><br />Where Fight Club goes from here is something that cannot be explained. A
must-see.
