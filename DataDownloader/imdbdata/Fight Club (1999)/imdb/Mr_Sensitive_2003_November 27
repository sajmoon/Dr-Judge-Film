I love this movie, that all I can say. Even though it have been extremely
criticized by the critic. I love it. The movie is excellent. No comment. I
wish I could express myself better how great the film is, but why should I
do that when David Fincher already did. This is one of the best film of all
time no doubt, and are one of my all time favorite. Every thing about this
film is excellent from brilliant script, to casting, to acting, to every
thing. `Thank you, David Fincher for making this film so great' this is what
you will end up saying after you have seen the movie. This film is `Simply
the Best.'<br /><br />Min: 9/10
