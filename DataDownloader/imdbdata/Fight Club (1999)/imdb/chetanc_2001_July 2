This must be the first time that I've seen a movie simultaneously hating
and
loving it. My first reaction was to rewind and start watching it
again.<br /><br />The characters are dark and depressing, and they despair about the life
they
live in. And there are points in the movie when you cringe at the
starkness.
The film has a frank brutality which i haven't seen in a long time. You'll
refuse to understand why men would want to beat each other up and feel
good
about it, why people get self-destructive, why anyone would want to live
such depressing lives.<br /><br />But gradually, as the Fight Club progresses, the enormity of it develops
and
you'll begin to see the strength, the power and the message of the movie.
The climax, of course, is the topping. Simple and precise. It cuts clean
and
blows your mind away.<br /><br />Edward Norton is brilliant. Brad Pitt just as good. Helena Bonham Carter's
character makes you want to hate her, shake her and say,&quot; Get out of the
life you're living in!!&quot;. And of course, David Fincher ensures that the
movie is a cinematic treat. Fresh, spunky and original. You'll know what I
mean when you see the start credits and the 'shopping for furniture scene'
with Norton.<br /><br />This movie is soon going to become a classic. You'd better watch it now
and
have the pleasure of anticipation of seeing it happen rather than the awe
of
retrospection of it having happened.
