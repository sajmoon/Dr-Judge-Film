This was one of the best experiences I've had watching a movie.  It took me
in and kept me inside it from beginning to end credits.  I was totally
spellbound.<br /><br />This movie definitely didn't get the &quot;Hollywood&quot; treatment.  It had eye
candy that didn't happen at the expense of the plot (like &quot;Godzilla&quot;) for
one thing.  It had great cinematography that kept you glued to the screen.
The characters were carefully built up and maintained.  The dialogue was
crisp and intriguing; and incredibly it had a narrator that did not get in
the way of the movie!<br /><br />There is just not enough good things I can say about this movie.  I am in
my
30's, but it seems a lot of people I've talked to 40 or above were not as
impressed by it. I am not sure why.<br /><br />Anyway, it also has elements in it that beg for further viewings.  It had a
good secret that it kept &quot;close to it's chest&quot;, but you could see clues for
it early on so it didn't just &quot;appear&quot; out of nowhere near the end.  I
thought the casting was was great too!  I even liked Meatloaf in his
role!<br /><br />In closing, I'd like to say that I think it serves as an intriguing voice
for this generation lost within the whirlpool of
commercialization.
