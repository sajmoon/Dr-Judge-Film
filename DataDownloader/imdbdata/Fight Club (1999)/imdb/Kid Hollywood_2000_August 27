I thought I had already seen the worst movie of 1999 but &quot;Fight Club&quot; has to
take the cake. There was no point to this film and it was the waste of
talent for two otherwise excellent actors.<br /><br />There is not much to say about this film because there was not much
worthwhile remembering. After the first ten minutes of this film, I realized
I was watching a film that is best described by the condition of the house
the two lead characters were living in old, delapidated, rundown and an ugly
home.
 
Brad Pitt made a wrong career move selecting &quot;Fight Club&quot; and Edward Norton
just wasn't thinking as he made his decision. <br /><br />With a story that made no sense, action that was non-existent and
performances that were lacking &quot;Fight Club&quot; was nothing more than a time and
space filler for the studios.
