Fight Club is the most brilliant thing to happen to American Cinema in a
long time. I have so much to say about it, but I have said it so many times
from recommending it to my friends. I don't know one person who doesn't like
it, and it's visual style does not kill the substance. The last 40 minutes
are so bewildering, You may need a restraining system from viewing them.
Please see this movie, it's the most important movie of the '90's, and it's
sure to get better over the years. And it's not as violent as it's reputed
to be, if you can take the brutal fight scenes. Great opening credits, too,
and that Pixies song at the end perfectly suits the film.<br /><br />PLOT: 9 DIRECTION: 10 SCREENPLAY: 10 ACTING: 10 EVERYTHING ELSE:
