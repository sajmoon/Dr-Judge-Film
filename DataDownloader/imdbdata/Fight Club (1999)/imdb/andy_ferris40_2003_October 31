This film is quite simply superb. If you want to see truly scintillating
acting performances from Ed Norton and Brad Pitt (and the rest), in a
picture which is dripping with class, smoothness, philosophies, and so
much
more then this is for you. Don't be put off by the name - this film has
much
more to offer than fighting. Ok, there is some violence, but this is not
the
point of the movie atall. It simply has to be watched, if anything for the
unpredictable, shiver-inducing twist. Not to be missed.
