Even with a few plot holes, such as the fact that blowing up credit
card company buildings will not kill data records since they all have
separate and well-protected backup systems, this is an excellent
comment on the modern human condition.<br /><br />Watching it for the second time I saw it as a worthy sequel in spirit,
theme and sub-themes, to Arthur Miller&#39;s landmark &quot;Death of a
Salesman.&quot; Call it a 21st-century update. All of the same topics are
revisited - consumerism, materialism, job-derived self-identity, the
cheapening of humanity, emotional and social impotence, the blurring
and blending of reality and imagination.<br /><br />The fight scenes seemed somewhat improbable, but if one views them as
figurative rather than literal, the improbability becomes immaterial.<br /><br />A thinking man&#39;s film, up there with the best.
