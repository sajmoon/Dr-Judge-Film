I saw Fight Club opening night without wanting to go see it. A friend of
mine pressured me to go with him so I did. When we were in the theater I was
complaining about how bad this movie was going to be, mainly because these
types of movies are not my taste. By the time the movie was over I was left
speechless. The first thing that came to my mind was that from now on I was
going to see every movie directed by David Fincher.<br /><br />Fight Club is filled with so much energy its not even funny. It makes the
audience want to be in the movie. The direction is absolute perfection.
Fincher certainly has an eye for cinematography. Everything is composed so
beautifully, with the help of computer generated graphics it makes the film
seem even darker and more impressive. <br /><br />Ed Norton has never been better as an actor. His performance as an insomniac
is pure perfection. I'm positive enough to say that he will never be as good
as he was in this film. Helena Bonham Carter is as usual, beautiful. In
Fight Club it comes to show how the power of makeup can change a person's
appearance. To many people her look may seem repulsive, but I think she
looks attractive despite her role, I dug it. All I can say is that without
her Fight Club isn't the same. Brad Pitt is a macho guy who is pretty much
Ed Norton's character alter ego. I can't really comment on him, don't like
the guy that's all.<br /><br />All I can really say is that Fight Club is quite possibly one of the most
energetic and memorable movies of the 1990s. Everything an entertaining
movie needs is right here. Looking for a good time, look no further.
Unfortunately this wasn't nominated for any Academy Awards which it truly
deserved. If you ask me, Fight Club can kick American Beauty's ass any day!
Like every other person out there, I thought the Academy Award nominees for
the 99-year movies were terrible. Fight Club was the best picture of
1999
