This is beyond my ability to articulate since it is beyond my
experience, but not beyond my ability to appreciate.<br /><br />Men are alienated. They need a purpose. In our growing technological
society man&#39;s role is being diminished. He no longer is central to
survival. ATM&#39;s, Computers, and even the internet has co-opted their
sense of place. All is meaningless in this age convenience. Men have
grown soft living off the fat of the land (pun intended).<br /><br />I usually comment separately about the different elements of the movie.
But this time I won&#39;t because I would have to mention everything and I
don&#39;t have the energy to list all the features of a movie. Indeed this
movie is perfect in every aspect. 10+/10<br /><br />-Zafoid<br /><br />PS: now for the truth. Why is it, according to this movie, that men
have to feel a sense of place and purpose? I choose to turn it around
and say that the men who feel this way are those who only get a sense
of purpose from working with their hands or tools or ... weapons. In
this movie their hands are their weapons and thus their purpose -
indeed *Fight Club*.<br /><br />So it is clear then that these men are dinosaurs and they are dying
out. In reality this movie (and the book as well), is their death
knell. Their last &quot;hurrah&quot; to say &quot;we won the day&quot; &quot;we conquered the
enemy&quot; (the enemy in this case is the technology which has displaced
them - has co-opted their sense of purpose. Albeit their sense of
purpose - that of conquest - is indeed misplaced outdated and no longer
meaningful in a fully civilized and technological society. Indeed, we
can thank God that we don&#39;t have to fear every breathing moment. Is
this what they want? Yes. And so they are lost. But lost because of
their misplaced projection of what life is about. It is not about
conquest - it is about progress. Contributing with your mind and your
heart your science and your art your time and your understanding. But
these men can have none of that because they are trapped in their
veltanschaung of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;. So be it, but progress has
been going on since the dawn of man and it will not reverse. We have
come from the age of sticks to the age of jets and we ain&#39;t going&#39;
back!) So let&#39;s give them a last &quot;hurrah&quot; for they were once important
they were once the center of the world they were once the makers of
history - the makers of wars ... and nations. Bid them &quot;farewell&quot;
(&quot;Fare thee well, good knight.&quot;) and once and for all recognize their
last outcry - the last outcry of the last warrior.<br /><br />-Z
