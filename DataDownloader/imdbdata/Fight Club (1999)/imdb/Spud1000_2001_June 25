Whoever you are this film will cause a reaction.<br /><br />Mine was most definitely a good one. It was well acted, well
scripted
and well made. It was also very cleverly put together and David
Fincher
uses some very innovative techniques. At the core of the film however
is
some very astute and intelligent stuff and is loaded with food for
thought.<br /><br />The basic premise is that the central character (Norton's) starts
out
living life in misery despite following all the rules set out by
society
and advertising culture. It is only after he starts going about
things
the 'wrong' way that he finds solace. This isn't an easy message for
a
lot of people but it echos the falseness of modern society and is
hard
to argue against.<br /><br />There are many people who have slammed the film because it
apparently
advocates violence and anarchy. The point they are missing is that
it
only starts that way before slowly demonstrating it slipping out
of
control. The unpleasantness starts to show through. The
hypocrisy
becomes evident. (Tyler tries to 'free' people but in the
process
recruits and effectively brainwashes an army of 'spacemonkeys.')
All
this goes on until the narrator - and the viewer - are forced to
act
intelligently and draw a line somewhere and realize that generation
X
needs to start acting like adults.<br /><br />Bottom line is that you aren't supposed to like what you see.
Violence
is repulsive and this film demonstrates that very well. There are
far
too many films where scores of people fall with bloodless machine
gun
wounds and people are portrayed as heros for inflicting it. This
film
shows it warts and all. If it encourages you to do violent things,
you
need help.<br /><br />There is no denying that anyone who approaches this film
intelligently
will have something to think about here. Whether you agree or
disagree
with the philosophies is one thing, but most of the negative reviews
I
have seen are from people who either can't stand to see people
actually
getting hurt on film and have a central character start
out
squeaky-clean and end up scarred and twisted at the less
than
happily-ever-after ending, or miss the point entirely that that only
by
knowing what it is to have nothing, physically and morally, can
you
appreciate what it is to have something.
