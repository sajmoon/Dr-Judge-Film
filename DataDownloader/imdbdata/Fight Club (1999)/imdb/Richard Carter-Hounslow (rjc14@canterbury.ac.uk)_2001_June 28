Upon seeing this giant of the film world there was something that sparked
inside me.  It was only until afterwards, plently of study and looking at
many of others' comments have I been able to truly justify my reason for
liking this film.  I don't like it, that would be an understatement, I love
it, I go to bed with it and believe me I can last the full two
hours.<br /><br />It is not only I that adore this film, but there are many who hate it, but
still would add it otno their all-time top ten of greatest films.
Something
they can admire is my justification for people reasoning it in this kind of
way.  It is true, what is there not to admire the all-out vulgarity of the
film, but at the same time it has an intelligence and elegance.  It is a
six
feet tall slim blonde model who can defuse bombs and cure cancer type movie
in the metaphorical sense of the words.<br /><br />And who ever thought that a film would get made by a corporation like Fox?
is this paving the way for future films by the large studios that are
pushing avant-garde ideas into the mainstream?  Let's hope it is, because
it
is not just being appreciated by us, the people who read film in an
analytical sense, but it is appealling to the general film-going
audience.<br /><br />So many criticisms that I have heard, such as the levels of exposure in the
film.  I can see parts of people, and who ever said that we need to see all
of them.  I heard David Fincher's comments about it, and him saying that we
see too much of the eyes.  Relating this back to the primal state of the
film and the self-destructional aspect, Apes have black areas of the eye
where we have white so you cannot follow their gaze.  Now maybe that was
unintended by Fincher for me or anyone else to pick up, but still it is
true
that we always do not have to adhere to rules when making a film, rules are
there to be broken and this is something we have to hold in
ourselves.<br /><br />To say one last thing about Fight Club, you can enjoy it onany level you
want to, noticing every detail and really considering the effort that it
takes to give it this much depth, or just sit back and soak up this
original
(in terms of commercial cinema) aesthetic we have been offered.<br /><br />
