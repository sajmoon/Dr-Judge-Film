This movie operates on so many different levels that it really takes 
at least two viewings to get a grasp of what's really being said.
It's a great study that demonstrates the &quot;evils&quot; of consumerism
and the loss of one's self. The dialogue is witty, the pace excellent
and the direction flawless. It will make you think about who you are
and what your priorities in life are and should be.
