My neighbor was on me for a while to watch it, so I finally did, at his
house. Like many, I was surprised that it was nothing like what I
expected. My initial reaction was amazement that I haven't heard more
people talking about his movie. 1999??!! The overall impact was huge.
The acting was excellent, the story was highly engaging (with a twist I
NEVER saw coming,) and the cinematography was stunning.<br /><br />This is one of those flicks that REQUIRES several viewings. Obviously,
it's not about street-fighting, although the underground Fight Club
plays a key role. It's about the internal struggle of those of us who
feel trapped by our shallow materialistic culture. This movie explores
the boundary between healthy outrage and destructive rage; between
rebellion and revenge; between freedom and chaos. Lots to think about,
here. Many quotable lines, well delivered by the entire cast. The
interaction between Ed Norton's (nameless) character and his boss was
hysterical. Much could be said, but not without spoiling it for the
reader who hasn't seen it.<br /><br />The violence was a little too graphically depicted for my own taste; it
made me squirm in places, and seemed gratuitous. Bloody. This is my
only gripe, but it's likely that those with less sensitive
constitutions wouldn't be put off by it. NOT for the whole family. <br /><br />And then, of course, there are the subliminal insertions.<br /><br />Overall, a very intense viewing experience. One of those movies you
think about for days after seeing it.
