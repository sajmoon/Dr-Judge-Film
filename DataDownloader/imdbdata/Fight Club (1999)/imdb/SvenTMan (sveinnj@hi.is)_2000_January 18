The words &quot;Only when you've lost everything you are free to do anything&quot;
sums up the philosophy and does indeed describe a view on reality which
many
of us think about, but do not dare to apply in our every day, routine
guarded, existence. So to experiance it in a shallow but inspiring way as
in
a cinema is a treat no one person should miss.
