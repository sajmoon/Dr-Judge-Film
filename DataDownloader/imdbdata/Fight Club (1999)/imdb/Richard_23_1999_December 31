1999_December 31 

What a director, this David Fincher. He is able to twist a story  which, if
directed by anyone else, would be a boring psychological thriller. Through
the theater, I heard a lot of negative reactions (e.g. what a waste) but I
think the vast majority of them missed the whole point.<br /><br />I just have one comment: Powerful this movie is! Through the fact that you
have to re-think this movie proves that the Force is with Fincher. 1999 was
not a great year in movies (compared to 1998) but this one, Fight Club, is
the clear winner!
