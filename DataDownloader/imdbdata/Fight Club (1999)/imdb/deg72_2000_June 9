I can't believe some of the comments posted about this film! It started
off
reasonably, but then went downhill fairly rapidly and finally insulted the
viewers with such a lousy twist that they should have been entitled to a
refund. Good twists are supposed to make you view what's gone before in a
new light, but this one just made you (a) feel cheated, and (b) conclude
that it must have been dreamt up by a bored eight-year old.<br /><br />However, I am in danger of letting the rest of the film off the hook. To
summarise, it wasn't shocking, it wasn't amusing (but thought it was) and
it
certainly wasn't well-acted (another nail in the Edward Norton career
coffin). People may wish to work up the most complex theories they like
about allegories of society, reinventing conventional plotting, etc., but
anyone who seriously tries to defend a rank bad movie like this needs to
take a long hard look at themselves. I liked David Fincher's last two
films
and had every hope for this one, but it's an absolute stinker and no
mistake.
