Fight club ,a brilliant concept and a brilliant ending.This movie
twists your mind and bends it in various dimensions.The plot itself
makes you feel strange and the narration by Edward Norton here is very
much captivating.Faced paced mystery,fight club stands out in the
league of movies like Memento and The Usual Suspects.Edward Norton&#x27;s
best surely after American History X.His greatest performance and a
fantastic narration.Brad Pitt role of Tyler Durden is one of the very
unique roles you will ever see.Brad Pitt dialogs and just his presence
on the screen speaks for itself.Acting of everyone is mind blowing and
i cannot forget Helena Bonham Carter as Marla.She is a kind of drug
addict in the movie and her depiction by the director is superb.David
Fincher&#x27;s another masterpiece.This is a superb thriller,showing how
people can take out their frustration by turning to aggression.The
ending is very unique.And you just cannot imagine the
ending.Cinematography is brilliant.Surely after watching this once,you
would have to see it again.International cinema has such gem of a
thinking that i cannot even imagine.Mind blowing cinema.Fight club
fascinates and creates chaos in the mind.But thats the need for our
generation now.And if you are afraid of fighting go for fight club,then
