What a way to close the millennium! This movie does a good job of
summarizing the 1990&#39;s and really gets you thinking about what have we
done with our lives as an advanced western society and where are we
going from here.<br /><br />The greatest thing about this movie is that David Fincher (the
director) uses the system against itself, when he creates a big budget
Hollywood film whose all purpose is to speak against the culture
Hollywood dictates and the mainstream (&quot;We were raised on television to
believe that we&#39;d all be millionaires, movie gods, rock stars, but we
won&#39;t. And we&#39;re starting to figure that out&quot;) that turns us into
apathetic creatures who follow the herd, letting the blind lead the
blind (&quot;Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we
hate, so we can buy s**t we don&#39;t need&quot;) and the movie leads us to the
conclusion that &quot;losing all hope is freedom&quot;.<br /><br />Why? Because &quot;without pain, without sacrifice, we would have nothing&quot;.
The bottom line in this theory is that &quot;it&#39;s only after you&#39;ve lost
everything that you&#39;re free to do anything&quot;.<br /><br />Sure, there are some flaws too. After all, ironically, the same Tyler
that rebels against movie gods and rock stars and laughs when the
narrator asks cynically &quot;do real men look like that?&quot;, referring to
models&#39; posters - is himself the blond, pretty boy Brad Pitt who is all
those things!<br /><br />I guess this is Fincher&#39;s way of telling us that no theory is perfect,
and even Tyler himself eventually admits it to the narrator (&quot;I look
the way you want to look, I f**k the way you want to f**k&quot;). Well, so
he&#39;s not really the &quot;all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world&quot; after
all...<br /><br />Anyway, I bought this movie as soon as it came out on DVD because this
movie is definitely NOT a &quot;one time deal&quot;. There are many small details
you can&#39;t possibly see on the first viewing and which would give it a
lot more meaning.<br /><br />Brad Pitt (who shows he is definitely not just a pretty face) and Ed
Norton give the performances of a life time!<br /><br />Meat Loaf will leave you shocked too. Let&#39;s just say you&#39;ll never look
at him the same way again...;-)
