Fight Club, by David Fincher, is the story of a man who comes to grip with
the daily monotony that is his everyday life, by starting a club in which
friends beat each other senselessly in hopes of having a good time.  This
movie had all the right ingredients to be a great film.  With the help of
superlative performances and brilliant photography, Fight Club is quite a
picture.  However, the dark aspects of the film and preposterous climax make
it hard for one to watch without cringing or laughing in the wrong spots. 
Fight Club takes many turns that are completely nonsensical in hopes of
making a political statement about United States economic culture. 
Nevertheless it is hard for one to listen to statements such as these
without questioning where the money came from to make such a film.  Fight
Club is defiantly an inventive film but in the end like the Portland
Trailblazers, it just doesn't `click.'
