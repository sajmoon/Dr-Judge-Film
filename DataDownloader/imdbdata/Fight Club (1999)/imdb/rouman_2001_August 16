Fight Club is not a film that you may like on the first watch. The more you
watch it the more you like it. It has so many details and symbolism that
it's impossible to catch them all on the first time. It also has little
surprises on it that appear as flashes (for example in the end and the
flashes of Tyler on the beginning).
In my opinion it is with Snatch (also starring Brad Pitt) the Best Film
Ever.
Hope you watch it (more than just one time)
