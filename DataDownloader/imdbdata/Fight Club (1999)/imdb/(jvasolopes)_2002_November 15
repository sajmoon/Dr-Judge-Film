Hi there! I can't help myself from comment fight club, the best movie
ever
made.
Dispite of being very well made, the most important thing about this
movie
it's his message, his theories, his contents.
The argument is brilliant, and david Fincher has worked very well in its
prodution. The fact that Edward Norton caracter has no name; the images
falshes of tyler before he appears; the message... all of it is  driving
my
crazy!!<br /><br />From Vasco
