This film could very easily be frowned upon if one doesn't really look at
what's being presented.  From the blunt title to the underlying theme of
fist-fight clubs, on face value 'Fight Club' would be seen as just a macho
man-movie with nothing behind it.  The actual violence isn't really that
much if you think about it....only one person actually dies in the movie. 
As someone pointed out in the DVD booklet, you see more violence in the
first 10 minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan' than you see in all 139 minutes of
Fight Club.  <br /><br />The highlight of the film is the great acting and even better dialogue. 
This is one of those films that can stand on its piercing dialogue alone,
you don't feel that its 2 hours and 20 minutes.  This is Edward Norton's
finest performance along with Primal Fear and probably American History X. 
This is also one of Brad Pitt's best moments, he played the alter ego
perfectly.  David Fincher has a knack for the disjointed, dark feel, and he
uses it to perfection here.<br /><br />Fight Club is a much deeper film than one would think, seeing how it was
marketed and advertised.  As far as it being on the Top 250 list, that's
probably attributed more to male teens just infatuated with the macho male
pride fist-fighting and blood rather than the message buried inside.  Still,
'Fight Club' is one of the best films to come out in the past few
years.<br /><br />***1/2 out of **** stars.
