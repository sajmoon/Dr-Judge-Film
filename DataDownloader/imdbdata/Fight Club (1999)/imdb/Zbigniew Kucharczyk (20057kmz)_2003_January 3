1999 brought us many inventive and brilliant films and this one is at the
top of the class. It challenges society and especially American way of
life.
If you have a happy life because you are happily married and have the job
you like then you will not understand this film. But since most people are
not like that then this film will make you feel not alone and will
challenge
you to act and change your life. This masterpiece has lots of dark humour
mainly to keep the audience entertained but this film is at its heart very
smart and serious.
