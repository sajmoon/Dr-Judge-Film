&#x22;Fight Club&#x22; is brutally honest and convincing about the world we live
in today. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton do their best to change the world
they live in by adopting a lifestyle involving non-consumerism and they
do this by getting people they know who are vulnerable to their
emotions. And that&#x27;s what people don&#x27;t understand when watching this
movie for the first time.<br /><br />Behind the scenes there are brands and Pitt was meant to look like a
model with a perfect body structure. It&#x27;s all pure symbolism.
Everything in each frame is there for a reason. If people thought this
was a film that was just about mindless violence, think again. This
film preaches how bad money is and for a movie that is out there just
to make a buck, it is brilliant! Fincher has been an all around
talented director. His dark use of lighting sets the tone beautifully
in a world that is going to destroy itself one day because of
obsession, business, modeling etc. A key phrase to remember when
watching this movie: &#x22;The things you own end up owning you&#x22;. After you
watch this movie with a clear understanding, your life is going to
change and you&#x27;ll end up saving more money. Definitely worth the time.
&#x22;Fight Club&#x22; definitely has a message worth listening to.
