I think there is nothing bad to say about this movie. It really gets you
into the character's psychology and you can perfectly see his evolution (at
work, for example). I would advise anyone to see this movie at least once
since I think it has something for everyone and, whoever you are, it will
make you think a lot about what you see and what you do.
Enjoy!
