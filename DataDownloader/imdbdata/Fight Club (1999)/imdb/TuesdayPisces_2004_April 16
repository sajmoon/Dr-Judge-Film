Fincher's &quot;Fight Club&quot; is an essential work of art for all Nietzsche
students and readers. As it really takes the story to its completion,
something that the novel is unfortunately afraid to do, the movie is the
most amazing and compelling illustration of Nietzsche's most famous
concept:
the will transforming itself into power - 'Wille zur Macht'.
As Tyler Durden immerses himself in the search of his individuality, he
progressively rids himself of anything that is not him and goes back to
the
essential: will and his desires. Until he finally experiences the
nietzschean achievement of transforming his will and desires into pure
power. The movie doesn't stop there though and in a superb ending offers
to
the viewer the most important question once you've reached the
transformation and purification of your will and instincts, which can only
be done by overcoming the fear of death: will you use your power for
destruction (nihilism) or to build a future (love)? Or both?<br /><br />A masterpiece and a &quot;must&quot; for all philosophy students!
