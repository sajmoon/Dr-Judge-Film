<br /><br />Fight Club is one of those movies that comes along and screws with the
heads of all those people who enjoy movies like she's all that.  There are
no straight lines only curvy lines that run off in tangents, this is what
makes Figh Club a movie to be remembered. The book was a fresh read and the
movie was just as good. I know there are a lot of people that did not like
this movie because it is not straight forward, and I am sure there are many
of you out there that run into the same people.  Well for me movies like
fight club, the usual suspects, and the lost highway are why i keep coming
back.
