Fight club is my all time favorite movie b/c it is so original and
unlike any other movie i have ever seen. I was just wondering if anyone
else read the book...i can't believe that this book is Chuck
Palahnuik's first book...wow! I thought it was funny where the narrator
and Tyler meet in the book versus the movie. I also think Edward Norton
is an AMAZING actor...he was so good in American History-X too! Fight
Club was perfectly cast...i can't imagine it being what it is today if
it had been cast differently. &quot;Sticking feathers up your butt does not
make you a chicken.&quot;--Tyler Durden<br /><br />Fav. Quotes: &quot;A condom is the glass slipper for our generation&quot;--Marla
Singer<br /><br />&quot;I am Jack's complete lack of surprise&quot;-- Narrator<br /><br />&quot;Now as a question of etiquette, do I give you the a** or the crotch?
&quot;--Tyler<br /><br />&quot;After fighting, everything else in your life got the volume turned
down. &quot;-- Narrator<br /><br />&quot;We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We
have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual
war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on
television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie
gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that
fact.&quot;--Tyler Durden
