Fight Club was produced by a major Hollywood studio.  It had a budget of
$60
million+.  It is not your average big-budgeted studio film.  In fact, it
has
very few qualities of a big-budgeted studio film.  At it's least, it is
raw,
provocative, original (although a lot of Tyler Durden's philosophy is very
Neitzsche-esque), idiosyncratic, and entertaining.  It is commentary on
consumerism, materialism, trends, addictions, office work, indentity
crisis,
blind faith, sheep, capitalism and everything else that makes up modern
society in America (Americana).
The basic outline is about a worker-bee fed up with is daily routine and
doing something about it.<br /><br />**** out of ****.  If you can find a theater still playing it and you
haven't seen it, DEFINITELY check it out.
