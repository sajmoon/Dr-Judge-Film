2005_June 19 
I won't write a lot about this film, mainly because my English is very
poor, but also because the most important things about &quot;Fight Club&quot;
were said and written in previous comments. What I'd like to state here
is: I sat down one night in front of my TV set and started watching
&quot;Fight Club&quot;, because I really hadn't anything better to do that very
night. I remember I thought &quot;it should be another &quot;Van Damme-style&quot;
action movie, with a bunch of tough guys trying to beat the crap out
one to another, with the power of their fists&quot;. Well, the title didn't
gave me any hope of getting something better. The movie started and the
fights didn't, at least for a long while. What i saw was a very
philosophical movie that captured my attention from the very beginning
to the very end. And yes, if I expected for some action, the action was
there too... but just as an exclamation mark, to enforce the whole idea
of the film. And when I reached the final scene, I didn't have a single
doubt about it: it was the perfect end to such a great movie. Thanks,
Lord, for not giving to me anything better to do that night that sit in
front of my TV set and watch a movie.
