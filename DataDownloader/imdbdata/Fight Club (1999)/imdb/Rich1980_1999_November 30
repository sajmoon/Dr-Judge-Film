so, go see it.  I saw Fight Club for the fourth time and the only people
there were myself and my girlfriend, who had seen it once before, with me. 
Why was this movie neglected like it was.  It is everything you could want. 
I can't wait until May when it comes out on DVD, so I can watch it over and
over again. If you find yourself at home with nothing to do, instead of
masturbating, jump in your car and go see Fight Club.  Being John Malkovich
also kicks ass.  These two should both be nominated for Oscars, or at least
a friggin Golden Globe.
