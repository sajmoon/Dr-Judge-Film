FIGHT CLUB (1999)
Rating: 10/10<br /><br />Anyone who does not agree with me that Fight Club is a brilliant and
unforgettable film must have left their head at the supermarket last night.
The film's script is brutally correct, it gets all the aspects of living
free and hell on earth with extreme correctness, and you can relate to all
the characters. Each of the characters will become you at some time of every
day and you'll feel their power, greed and confusion for at least an hour
each day. It's such an amazing thing to be another person, and that is what
is like to watch this dark, amazing drama that is surely one of the best
films of 1999. Brad Pitt is stunning as Tyler, literally blowing you away
with a performance that is a small fraction away from perfect and is played
to an Oscar-worthy status. Edward Norton is also very plausible, capturing
his character's misery with a differently funny/dramatic type of power.
David Fincher once again proves when he puts himself behind the camera; he
also has an eerie presence in front of it, and that is the feeling of a true
director emerging once again with a fantastic, unbelievably good film. This
movie is not for the faint-hearted,  and if you are one of those squirmy
people, if you can get over the fights, blood and see through this film to
the morals and brilliance it beholds, you'll come out extremely satisfied.
