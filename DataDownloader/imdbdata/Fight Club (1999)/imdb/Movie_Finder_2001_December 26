Many people seem to think Fight Club is a film about guys who join a
club and bash the living daylight out of each other. This is simply not
the case. Fight Club is a film that questions our society and reality.
It is a film with many deep and effective meanings.<br /><br />The Narrator (Edward Norton) plays a wimpish insomniac who is living a
boring life, filled with predictable events and no thrills. He is stuck
in a dead-end job and the only real motivation for his existence is the
will to help people who are dying and to collect furniture. All of this
changes when he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) who shows him that there
is more to life than collecting furniture. Tyler seems to be every
man's dream as he gets to participate in exciting occupations and
events as well as engage in much sexual activity.<br /><br />&quot;You are not your job, you are not how much money you have in the bank,
you are not the contents of your wallet, you are not a beautiful and
unique snowflake, it is not until you have lost everything that you are
free to do anything.&quot;<br /><br />These are some of the lessons in which Tyler lives by and tries to
deliver to Jack and the rest of the world.<br /><br />Overall, Fight Club is an Exceptional movie with an outstanding twist,
and although it contains some gruesome violence, it is a movie that
MUST be seen by anybody who is tough enough to question their motives
and beliefs about existence. 10/10.
