I haven&#39;t read the novel, but I am familiar with other works by Chuck
P., and this movie definitely pulled off the feel of his writings. This
movie comes together with acting, editing, and music that are very well
done and fit the mood and atmosphere of the story. It is difficult to
think of something I didn&#39;t like in this film since I don&#39;t have the
book to compare it to. Also, in comparison to most films that are found
in theaters, this movie is an outlier. The name of the film implies a
focus on fighting, but this is not the case. So for anyone who enjoys a
story with interesting characters and plot, Fight Club is for you. If
you want something easy to take in, watch something else.<br /><br />-T
