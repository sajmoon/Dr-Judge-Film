Fight Club is a great movie.  Notice that everyone who reviewed it has very
strong feelings about it, even those who didn't like it.  Nobody is saying
it's boring or stupid. I always thought of Brad Pitt as just a pretty boy
suitable only for chick movies, but he and Edward Norton are both very good
in this.  And Pitt does one of the best Bruce Lee impersonations in this
flick that I have ever seen.  This is a thought provoking, intense and funny
movie that could change your life...  you IKEA boys and girls!!!!
