2004_March 2 

To be honest with you, when I saw the title of the movie, I thought it was
going to be another mindless action film.  But then something happened.....I
actually watched it.  I thought the movie was genius.  It wasn't so much
about fighting.  It was more about schizofrenic office worker that suffered
from insomnia.  Brad Pitt, the star of the movie, played his character
(Tyler Durden) flawlessly.  Throughout the movie, Ed Norton's character (the
narrator) was trying to fight his inner demons which were preventing him
from getting any sleep.  With the help of several small terrorist groups, a
disturbed female that pretended to suffer from testicular cancer, and Tyler
Durden (a self righteous psycho), the narrator can finally resolve his
problems.  I feel I would have enjoyed the movie much more had not my
brother spoiled the damn ending before I watched it, but even without the
surprise ending, Fight Club still makes my top 10.
