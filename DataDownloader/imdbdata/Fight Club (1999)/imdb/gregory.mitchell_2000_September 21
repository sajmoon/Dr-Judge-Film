Listen: for all it's virtues (amazing direction, great acting
performances),
FIGHT CLUB suffers greatly from it's simple-minded sheep in wolf's
clothing
story.<br /><br />FIGHT CLUB is *not* visionary, folks - it's reactionary, and that belies
any
of the strengths all you passive aggressive dirtbags attribute to this
cool-looking but ultimately sophomoric w**k-job of a movie.<br /><br />Maybe I'm going soft, but I like REAL sincerity, sentiment and meaning in
movies - not self-referential, reactionist bulls**t (&quot;OOH, Starbucks is
evil! IKEA is satan's furniture store! McDonald's serves Beezelebub's
breakfast!&quot;).<br /><br />Oh, and the reason(s) FIGHT CLUB got shuffled along on it's merry way in
1999? MAGNOLIA, AMERICAN BEAUTY, BEING JOHN MALKOVICH and THE
MATRIX.<br /><br />Makes sense to me.
