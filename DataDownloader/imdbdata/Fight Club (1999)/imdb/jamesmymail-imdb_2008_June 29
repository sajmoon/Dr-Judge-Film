I won&#39;t say much about this film except if you like the drama and depth
of Ultimate Fighting, then this film is for you.<br /><br />If you can&#39;t stand watching good actors, with bad dialog and a script
that seems to not really make much of a point then stay away! I think
the rating must be skewed because those that were attracted to the
topic watched it and those that were not never considered it.<br /><br />Ebert&#39;s review was pretty spot-on. &quot;The Game&quot; and &quot;Se7en&quot; are far
better films from the same director that actually have a plot and good
dialog. Heck why not rent &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; which deals with the
topic of violence in a far more interesting fashion and if uncut makes
this &quot;Fight Club&quot; look like a children&#39;s story.<br /><br />That this film is ahead of &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; or even worse
&quot;Citizen Kane&quot; shows just how well the process of dumbing down the
audience is working. And people wonder why Hollywood makes so few good
movies with depth.
