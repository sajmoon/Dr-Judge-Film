the graphic violence of this film might scare off some weak-stomached
viewers, HOWEVER, fight club features some of the most provocative,
intelligent dialogue of any film released in recent memory.  fight club
gives the audience a thought provoking view of our modern world.  this
movie
was not what i expected - i expected only a bare-knuckle-boxing movie
starring brad pitt.  what i got was much more.  edward norton is
convincingly pathetic and his transformation from weakling in this film to
menacing hulk in American History X, also released in 1998, is impressive.
tyler durden's social commentary is right on with lines like &quot;the things
you
own end up owning you&quot;.  if you can stomach some violence that is
significantly harsh at times, and if you can look past some of the bull
spewed from tyler's mouth, you will really enjoy this flick.  david
fincher's best film as of yet.
