The whole point of films is artistic expression, just likes music,
literature, whatever, but because of the money involved in cinema, movies
have turned into pure entertainment. In an age of action dependent,
poorly
written movies, Fight Club stands out as an example of what movies should
be
like. Some of you say its boring, but I think stupid action movies with
implausible plots and cheesy dialogue are what's boring. Wow so some
guy's
head got blown off, big deal, it's just special effects. Fight Club is
great
because there's a point to the movie, the film has something to say about
the human condition, and it does it in a vivid and effective way...that's
what a movie should be like.
