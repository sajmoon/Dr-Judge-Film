When I went to see &quot;Fight Club&quot; in the theater three years ago I was
naturally expecting a terrific, impressive, exciting and highly enjoyable
experience. I had a good reason, I adored David Fincher's earlier
masterpieces &quot;Seven&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Game&quot; (1997) so very much (both are
definitely in the best thrillers of the decade top 10) I knew this one had
to be pretty excellent movie too. I certainly wasn't expecting to see one of
the best motion pictures of my whole life, but surprisingly that's precisely
what happened. When I walked out of the theater with my mouth wide open I
was astonished and stunned: I had just seen something so spectacular,
amazing and unique I really couldn't believe it and I'm not sure if I still
can.<br /><br />I mean how can a movie be this damn good?!?! Is it even practically
possible? Is this film for real? Of course it's actually very easy to
criticize &quot;Fight Club&quot; because of the obvious reasons. It's sick, extremely
violent, widely provoking, and downright insane. Nevertheless unbelievable
and ultra-wild story, sensational visual style, witty and irresistible
script, fantastic dialogue, crazy and breathtaking surprises and phenomenal
Oscar calibre performances from Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Meat Loaf makes
&quot;Fight Club&quot; a magnificent never before seen masterpiece and like I said at
least I have to admit: this is one of the best movies ever. I would like to
give this ingenious classic 11 out of 10 it that was only
possible.
