this is quite simply one of the best movies ever made, and probably the
best
film to come out the year it was released. fincher has the kubrickian
quality of always making excellent films and not getting the recognition he
deserves at the oscars. this is what i call a typecasting movie. what i
mean, is that in some eyes the actors and directors will be most well known
for this movie. fincher continues to make excellent films, but i think this
is his best. edward norton delivers another oscar-worthy performance. brad
pitt gives his best role ever, surpassing his role as david mills in seven.
a genius score by the dust brothers doing their best work to date, superb
make-up as always by the master rob bottin. a great role by helena bonham
carter. and dont forget about the supporting players in meat loaf and jared
leto has angel face. this is also the best dvd on the market, now and
forever. a reason in itself to buy a dvd player. one of the few movies
worthy of a weekly viewing.
