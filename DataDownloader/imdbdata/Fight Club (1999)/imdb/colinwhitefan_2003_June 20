I watched Fight Club for the first time the other day, I really thought it
was a very interesting and entertaining film. Fight Club has some nice
quotes mostly from Tyler Durden, Edward Norton is a super actor, Brad Pitt
as Tyler was outstanding and Helena Bonham was pretty sexy in her own way as
Marla, loved the brief sex scene of her. There is a reason Fight Club is in
the top 250, but #39 may be a little high. Fight Club is a pretty good film
worth your time, was worth mine.
