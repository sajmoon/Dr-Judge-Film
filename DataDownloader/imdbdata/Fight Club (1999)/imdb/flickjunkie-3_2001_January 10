Many friends had recommended Fight Club to me, so when I missed it at the
theatre, I was a bit p****d off. Then came the chance for video, and wow!
was it an experience...<br /><br />Edward Norton stars as Jack, a chronic ismoniac desperate to escape his
excruciatingly boring life. That's when he meets Tyler Durden (Brad pitt),
a
charismatic soap salesman with a twisted philosophy. Tyler belives that
self-improvement is for the weak - self-destruction is for the strong and
capable. Before long, Jack and Tyler are beating each other to a pulp in a
bar parking lot. To introduce other men  to the simple joys of physical
violence, Jack and Tyler start a secret underground Fight Club which
becomes
widly successful. But there is a big surprise coming towards
Jack...<br /><br />There are about 2 flaws which stop this film from being a complete
masterpiece. It may be slightly too slow-moving for some of the crowd, and
some of the things the fight club members do are wildly far-fetched. But,
still, there is an array of dazzling performances, particularly from our
two
leads, who both play their characters realistically and with absolute
honesty and passion. David Fincher goes beyond what he did in Se7en, and
that is quite an achievement to beat. Jim Uhls adapts the Fight Club book
perfectly, making a screenplay which is, infact, better than the actual
book
itself.<br /><br />The first rule of Fight Club is - &quot;You must see Fight Club.&quot;<br /><br />I rate Fight Club 9 out of 10.
