Fight Club is about Jack (Edward Norton). An insomniac young man in a
'white shirt and neck tie' desk job who is looking for a way to change
his life. Until he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) who is everything
that Jack wants to be. Together they seek revolution in mankind and
form a terrorist organization known as Fight Club.<br /><br />Not only did I love this film, but I just can't get enough of it. Fight
Club is a great achievement in film-making a must-see for film-lovers.
The whole atmosphere of it just drew me in and I couldn't look away I
was seriously that intrigued.<br /><br />The performances are tops particularly Edward Norton. He was just
stunning, coming across as the confused, delinquent, insane young man
who is desperate for a change of life, and who could be better for this
role than Brad Pitt. I'm not a great fan of Brad Pitt but he seemed
like the best actor for this kind of role.<br /><br />The relationship between Jack and Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) is also
very interesting. Sometimes he wants her and sometimes she wants him,
but they can't fit the mold and causes dilemma between the characters.<br /><br />The film also is very similar to the novel 'Fight Club' by Chuck
Palahnuik, with the exception of a few parts and in a different order.<br /><br />This is a film like no other
