This movie is surely in my top ten list.I can't understand why so many
people hate this movie.This movie should have got numerous academy
awards.But some movies though critically acclaimed are always ignored.A lot
of people can relate to this movie when they see the emptiness in their own
lives.Though I have never been a fan of Brad Pitt,I have to admit that this
is one of the best performances I have ever seen.Edward Norton was amazing
as the nameless narrator.This movie surely deserves a 10 out of 10.Let's
hope more movies like these are produced in Hollywood.
