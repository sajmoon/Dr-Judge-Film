The movie kicks butt. The script was incredible. One of the best movies
I've
seen in a long long time. The ideas that came out of there were so
original
and thought provoking. Not only was the script awesome but the acting was
incredible. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton did a great job. If you haven't
seen
it yet look out for Meat loaf too. The movie is so good I'm don't know
what
to type. Just go see it if you haven't. It will change your outlook on
life... I promise.
