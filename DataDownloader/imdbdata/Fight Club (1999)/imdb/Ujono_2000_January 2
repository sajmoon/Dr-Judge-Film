2000_January 2 
<br /><br />First of all, I must apologize for one of my shortcomings with this
article.  Due to my slackness in getting into the theater, I missed the
first few minutes, but don't worry.  Everything still came
together.
&quot;Fight Club&quot; is the newest dark film from director David Fichner
(&quot;Seven&quot;).
The main difference between the two is that this has a lot more
undertones
of comedy.
The story itself follows the nameless main character, played by Edward
Norton (American History X).  This character (let's call him Jack) is
having
severe problems with his life: he feels like it is caving in on him.  The
entire movie is narrated by Jack, whose sense of dry wit is often amusing.
He tries to make himself feel better by buying kitchen sets from catalogs,
which is illustrated with an amazing shot of Jack walking through a living
catalog, but nothing helps.  Finally, Jack turns to support groups,
visiting
under false names and crying about diseases and afflictions he doesn't
have.<br /><br />Just as he starts to get his life to a tolerable state, &quot;she&quot; starts
getting
involved in the groups.  &quot;She&quot; refers to Marla Singer, a trashy looking
girl
played by Helena Bonham Carter (&quot;Hamlet&quot;), who has a certain aura of Sadie
Burke around her (if you don't understand, read &quot;All the Kings Men&quot;).
Marla
is a faker, like Jack, and Jack can't cry with another faker in the group.
This leads the two of them to split up the seven support groups among
themselves, and they each get each other's numbers.
Now, Jack works for a transportation company and he has to make trips
about
accidents or other problems with vehicles.  One of his trips leads him to
meet Tyler Durden, an egotistical young soap salesman who is intrigued by
Jack's cleverness.  When Jack goes back home to his condo, he finds that
his
room is now a pile of smoking rubble.  Needless to say, Jack needs help
and
calls upon Tyler, played by Brad Pitt (&quot;Interview With a Vampire&quot;) for
shelter in a run-down large house.
One of the most powerful scenes in the film comes when Tyler and Jack sit
down at a bar and discuss the way that life works.  The conversation
inside
concludes with a statement by Tyler: &quot;The things you own end up owning
you.&quot;
Then they take their talk outside, where Tyler asks Jack to hit him,
after
which they get into a full-fledged, good-natured fight.<br /><br />This inspires the two of them to create the titular organization of &quot;Fight
Club&quot;, which becomes a haven for guys who want to, well, fight.  The first
rule: you do not talk about fight club.  The movie then follows the
evolution of the club and a romance involving Tyler and Jack with Marla as
the center of attention.  And everything goes smoothly.
Until Tyler takes it too far.
&quot;Fight Club&quot; is one of the cooler-looking movies I've seen this year.
It's
not my favorite, but it certainly was amazing in certain perspectives.
The
narration by Jack was, as said before, often hilarious.  It constantly
shows
us the thoughts of Jack, and they're always interesting.  There are a lot
of
cool flashbacks, interesting shots (such as a zooming out close-up of a
filled trashcan), and weird thoughts (Jack's cave and his power animal).<br /><br />This movie was not without drawbacks.  I felt that some of the scenes were
unnecessary and could have stood to be taken out.  Plus, some of Tyler's
actual antics bothered me quite a bit (but don't miss the pigeon thing).
Also, this may not be a movie for girls, as it is more of an action movie
than anything and makes itself quite clear that it is made for
males.
However, Tyler's basic philosophies kept me captivated.  He holds many of
the same views that I do.  I especially like his statement from the
previews:  &quot;We've all been raised by television to believe we'd all be
rock
stars and movie gods.but we won't.&quot;
So, feel free to watch this movie if you can.  I would say that it is
worth
the five or six bucks for a ticket.  In the meantime, I shall be making
and
selling soap.
