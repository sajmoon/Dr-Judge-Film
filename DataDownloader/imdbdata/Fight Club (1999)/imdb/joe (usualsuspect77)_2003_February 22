This is an acquired taste, much like sauerkraut and A Clockwork Orange.I
don't like the latter, but Fight Club is a personal favorite. It's like
nothing I have seen before. The movie isn't afraid to knock you around. It
is a truly original film that chronicles the Narrator, who through a strange
group of events, meets and lives with the wild Tyler Durden who's out to
change the world. Every other line is quotable, and the film is a truly deep
experience. This review can't do the film justice. From it's utterly weird
opening to it's suprise twist ending, this is a wildly innovative and twisty
ride that I won't soon forget.
