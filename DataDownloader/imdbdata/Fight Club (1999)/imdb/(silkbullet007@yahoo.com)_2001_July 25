Tyler Durden....... that name has new meaning in my book, charismatic,
enigmatic hero....this guy rules!    hes everything a guy wants to be, cool,
meaningful, and most of all.....free!  this story is very complex to tell. 
Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, give magnificant performances...Brad Pitt's
best...short of Twelve Monkeys, and Edward Norton's best short
of.....American History X. (Also see his &quot;The Score&quot; came out recently, also
amazing)    so now Fight Club re-defined movies for me, I am a guy who likes
certain movies, but when I heard david Fincher was making this film....the
same mastermind behind Se7en....I was there. And to know that hes using Brad
Pitt again, well that was also smart. The Dust Brothers, you HAVE TO HAVE TO
HAVE TO HAVE TO HAVE TO HAVE TO buy the soundtrack to Fight Club, if you
already have'nt. This is the SOUNDTRACK!!!!! THE score!....this is the best
music I have ever heard, and I like music like Prodigy, Chemical
Brothers...etc. etc. and The Dust Brothers live up to them!....<br /><br />well not more to say, watch this movie, and get blown away....
