Man, enough cannot be said about that man, he is an incredible actor.
&quot;Fight Club&quot;, &quot;Fight Club&quot;, man, what hasn't been said about it? &quot;It's
an awesome movie, everyone should see this movie, this movie is the
bomb&quot;. Although I would agree that this was a great movie, do I think
it should be on the top 100? No, maybe top 250. I wouldn't go as far to
say that this is one of the best movies ever. But the acting is very
good and the story is f----- up as hell. That's all I give the film.
That's pretty much it. I would recommend this for Ed fans or Brad as
well. I expected a lot and only got about 89% of the film's
satisfaction. That's all I have to say about that.<br /><br />9/10
