1999_October 22 

I went in to Fight Club expecting to see a hep Rocky-type flick with a
kooky, underground, genX, caper style edge to it. In fact, I expected little
or nothing. Was I wrong? In every sense of the word, and then
some.<br /><br />Instead Fight Club delivers a strange, tense, funny, surreal, demented,
thought provoking, even charming experience. The movie is just plain good.
It confounds your expectations from the opening frame and keeps it up until
the credits roll. Edward Norton is very good as an overworked, corporate
nothing whose search for meaning leads him to Tyler Durden, Brad Pitt's
character, and into some pretty strange basements. Brad Pitt does his best
Brad Pitt, which is never bad, and brings to his role exactly what it needs,
namely: Brad Pitt. Helena Bonham Carter must be jumping for joy being able
to play a character from the 20th century, albeit the creepiest character
since Isabella Rossalini in Blue Velvet.<br /><br />David Fincher brings his usual sense of style and lushness to the visuals
making the movie nearly tangeable. The almost obscene amount of blood and
bodily fluids in the flick will make most squirm, but somehow Fincher is
able to keep it from becoming too much. The rest of the movie has more
twists than a pretzel factory and actually contains a moral lesson. If
morals aren't for you there's more than enough action to go around.<br /><br />So far, 1999 has shaped up to be the year of the mindf**k, at least as far
as movies go, and Fight Club will stand out as a strong contender if not the
winner by a TKO. Go see it. I dare you.
