After seeing this movie, I am an official Ed Norton fan! Whoooooooo! This
movie is perfect if you want to relieve stress, people rag on the ending
but
I thought the movie was eternally better than the overrated Sixth Sense.
But, to quote a former WWF wrestler, &quot;That's just my opinion, and I might
be
wrong... But I doubt it!&quot;
