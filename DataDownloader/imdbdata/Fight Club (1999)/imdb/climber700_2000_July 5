<br /><br />When i watched this movie over at my friend's house i didn't expect this
to
be such a great movie.  From the very beginning this movie gripped you and
wouldn't let go till the ending credits rolled.  i liked the underlying
meaning of this movie and agreed.  i do agreed that people get too wrap up
in their daily lives and material things (that don't really
matter.)<br /><br />Brad Pitt and Edward Norton did an excellent job and really got into their
parts.  The screenplay was a masterpiece and the direction was great..  i
recommend this to anyone over the age of 14.  in my opinion it's a 10/10.<br /><br />
