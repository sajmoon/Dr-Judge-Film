If American Beauty deserves an oscar than Fight Club deserves 10
oscars.....I would say this movie has been underrated by most people and not
given the respect it deserves.... the acting, sound, story, directing,
cinematagrophy are all A+ ....<br /><br />In the consumer society in which most of us live in .... this movie really
re-define the meaning of life...its a real work of art and story telling ,
with comedy , action and sex....<br /><br />This movie trully deserves to be in theatre as one the best films ever ....
And I rarely give a film 9/10 .....
