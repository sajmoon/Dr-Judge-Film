(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book &#x22;Cut
to the Chaise Lounge or I Can&#x27;t Believe I Swallowed the Remote!&#x22; Get it
at Amazon.)<br /><br />Director David Fincher, who brought us into the extraordinarily
depraved serial-killer world of Se7en (1995), fires up the shock
cauldron again with this high testosterone examination of our primal
need to seek adrenaline highs through physical violence. Indeed, the
message is we are not really alive unless we are involved in something
extreme.<br /><br />Ed Norton plays the Narrator, a corporate structure clog with insomnia
who gets off (and finds the arms of Morpheus) by going to therapy
groups for people with cancer, disfigurement, drug addiction, etc. The
idea is that seeing the acute and terrible misery of others affords him
a catharsis that clears the neuro-emotional blockage and allows him to
relax enough to get some sleep.<br /><br />But after a while he begins to notice Marla Singer (Helena Bonham
Carter--no relation to Hillary Rodham Clinton) hanging out at some of
the meetings. Her hair and eyes are black widow black, all the better
to set off her pasty white skin, giving her a witchy/sexy allure that
really in itself ought to excite Norton&#x27;s deadened neurons. (I know she
excited mine.) But instead what her presence at the talk-therapy
sessions does is remind him that he isn&#x27;t really suffering like the
others, and once again he has insomnia.<br /><br />Meanwhile he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) a handsome and virile
beauty soap salesman who is quick with the banter and has the
confidence of a demi-god, something Norton&#x27;s character lacks. They
become best buds (and a bit more) after Durden introduces him to the
full-out adrenaline rush of getting your face pounded in. As the fight
club scenes unfold, getting more and more ridiculous with each
bone-crunching punch and each darkening pool of blood, more and more
young men join the club allowing Tyler Durden to become an underground
hero and charismatic leader of human sheep dressed in black. By the
way, the real truth of the postmodern cowboy fisticuffs is that the
participants couldn&#x27;t even stand the injury to their hands from one
punch, let alone the repeated blows to face, head and body.<br /><br />But never mind. There&#x27;s a lot more to this movie than phony fight
scenes. The strange thing is a lot of the scenes are funny! Somehow an
aura of humor adheres to Fincher&#x27;s street mayhem, rock-the-house sex,
and body-slamming/bone-cracking absurdities. Not only that but the
acting by the principals and Meat Loaf&#x27;s massively-breasted Bob Paulson
is excellent. Norton&#x27;s confused and determined whimsy is nicely off-set
by Pitt&#x27;s brazen pathology. The story plays out well with some nice
surprises and some good tension. You will not be bored.<br /><br />Philosophically speaking too there is more than a grain of truth in the
thesis: we really are divorced to some extent from our primal nature.
We are animals who have domesticated ourselves. A return to the jungle
(for example, by watching this film) energizes us and reminds us that
part of our nature is largely incompatible with civilization.<br /><br />Be forewarned however that this is a grossly violent movie that is
difficult to watch at times. Fincher&#x27;s primary intent is to shock, and
he works hard at that. The scene at the back alley of a liposuction
clinic as our boys are dumpster-diving for soap ingredients is
particularly grossitating. When one of the bags holding human fat gets
snagged on a barbed wire fence, it bursts, dripping it contents onto
the Narrator.<br /><br />If you can stand this sort of thing, watch and be beguiled or revolted,
but first, please send the kiddies to bed.
