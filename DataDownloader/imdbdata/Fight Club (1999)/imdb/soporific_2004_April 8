2004_April 8 

I finally got around to seeing Fight Club last night (on 9 April 2004) - a
good 5 years after it came out. You see I've been avoiding watching the
film
for quite a silly reason ... and now I can't believe how much my first
impression of Fight Club was off the mark. You see, we only have one life
and I'm certainly not going to spend it watching vehicles for
profit-making
passed off as art. With Hollywood still kicking around, I don't watch 99%
of
films made. That makes me soo happy just thinking about it. I see about a
dozen movies a year and by golly I make sure all of them are worth
it.<br /><br />So, my reason for avoiding 'Fight Club'? it was because I just couldn't
think a movie with that title could be any good. That's it. Please hit me,
I
deserve it.<br /><br />Anyway, bit by bit over the years my desire to see it increased. People
kept
telling me what a great film it was. I would ask them to rate some other
films to check out their critical analysis skills (relative to mine) and
sometimes people would have exactly the same movie tastes but they would
include 'Fight Club' as one of their all-time favourite movies. So I
thought, one day I'm *totally* bored maybe I will ...<br /><br />I watched the film ... what a ride!! Totally thrilling and rich in ideas,
the highest quality art in every department, and bravely executed (the
last
scene is definitely the Scene Of Our Times). My only criticism is from a
movie-impact point of view - I don't think the film gives a helpful
reflection of how humans really are. Despite the dialogue correctly
identifying the source of human alienation (the capitalist system), it
seems
quite a few people have missed half the message. When people say they are
Tyler Durden or that all humans are, and then forget to mention that this
is
not inevitable or a natural part of our nature but one induced by living
inside the system, well this is dangerous. They look at the world going to
pieces around them and say 'we're f**ked' and see humans as the source of
the world's problems instead of the system. Actually the film's dialogue
does repeat this over and over, I just wish more people would understand
the
difference, especially on this site!!<br /><br />Anyway, this experience has taught me a lesson - if you don't give people
a
go, or ideas a go, you don't learn anything and if you do, you will. If
you
only want to experience the good you'll miss out on a lot of it due to
inbuilt prejudice. I nearly didn't watch this film - I'm shuddering just
thinking about it.<br /><br />So, if you haven't seen Fight Club yet, do yourself a favour - forget the
title and any images in conjures up in your mind - there's so much more to
the film. I wished I'd seen it at the movies - I would have loved to watch
other people's expressions as they came out after seeing that last scene.
Again, watch this film - don't make the same mistake I nearly did
!!!
