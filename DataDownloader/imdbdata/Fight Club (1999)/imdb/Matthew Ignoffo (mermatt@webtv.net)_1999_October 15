1999_October 15 

This film is a nightmarish mix of PI, THE ADDAMS FAMILY, PSYCHO, and MATRIX
with the old TV show &quot;The Prisoner&quot; thrown in for good measure. The theme
seems to be that macho anarchy is the way to counteract society, social
mores, and the social mask we all wear to cover who we really
are.<br /><br />One of the weird symbols in the story is soap -- it cleanses, but not in a
true sense. It cleanses only out of our vanity and self-destructive need to
erase who we are. Heavy, huh?<br /><br />We get a pseudo-Thoreau blended with a psycho-Socrates rejecting phoniness
by creating new phoniness and turning the Socratic motto of &quot;Know Thyself&quot;
on its head. The film makes fun of support groups where people play &quot;who's
the biggest victim&quot; by depicting characters who are tourists in their own
life. Heavy again, huh?<br /><br />There's an in-joke if you look carefully -- Brad Pitt's pretentious
self-discovery epic 7 YEARS IN TIBET is playing at a theater in the
background of one shot in the film. This seems to be a bit of self-mocking
that this movie makes of its own self-discovery journey.<br /><br />To sum it up, I can think only of a line from the wonderful actress Tallulah
Bankhead: &quot;Dahling, there's less here than meets the eye.&quot;
