<br /><br />    Having much less violence than I thought- hey, no intentions to KILL, no
impalement- I found that there is a reason why younger audiences can relate
better to this movie than older ones. And it's not because of the
soundtrack, or the actors.<br /><br />    It's the curiosity young people still have for something, whether
positive or negative, scratching just below the surface of American culture.<br /><br />    Yeah, older people find it bad that they have to live in a society where
they are forced to 'work jobs they hate so they can buy  s@!t they don't
need', but they just want to live the rest of their lives as simply as
possible. Young people haven't been yet traumatised by what is ugly, filthy,
and honest; so they are kind of intrigued by it. They can see through the
dirt and blood of the movie and see the real story behind &lt;Fight
Club&gt;.<br /><br />     About a 20-something man who feels out of touch with reality. We can
all relate to this, but if you're young enough, you'll really enjoy this
thrilling ride into the post-modern American psyche.<br /><br />     <br /><br />     It will be hard for Fincher to top this masterpiece, but if he's as
consistent as he has been, we're in for a lot more...I can't
wait!<br /><br />    ----------Of all movies, I could have written a more extensive review on
THIS one, but I'll let the more experienced reviewers below spell it out.
Just know that, though I never rate  movies, I gave this one a 10!(And I'm
into romantic comedies!)=)<br /><br />-Sep
