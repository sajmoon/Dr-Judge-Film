Over the past few years, Fight Club has become my favorite movie. When
I begin thinking about what actually attracts me to the thriller so
much, the first things that come into my mind is uniqueness and
completeness.<br /><br />Few movies have successfully captured such a twisted plot and produced
an enjoyable, edge of the seat movie like Fight Club. From the
beginning, the camera shots and ideas really get your adrenaline
pumping. Combine the unbelievable graphics and stunt-effects with a
boring turned exciting story and you have the makings for one hell of a
ride.<br /><br />Fight Club truly has the entire package. Many good movies are close to
being complete, but typically lack one or two key aspects for
entertainment. Fight Club has the actors (Brad Pitt and Ed Norton&#39;s
best acting jobs), the plot (unique and relative), and one of the best
endings in movie history.<br /><br />You must ride this baby out because if you miss anything, you may be
sorry.
