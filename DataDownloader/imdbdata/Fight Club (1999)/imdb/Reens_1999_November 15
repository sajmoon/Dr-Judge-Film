There are no words to express how much I liked this film. The story itself
is so unique YOU have to figure out what's happening. Norton's performance
is excellent.
The story is totally unpredictable leaving YOU to comprehend
it....
This film has brilliant casting and Finscher's direction is fantastic.This
film is a masterpiece and will never be forgotten.
