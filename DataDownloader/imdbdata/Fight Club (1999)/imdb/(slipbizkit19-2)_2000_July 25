Fight Club was a great picture staring Edward Norton, and Brad Pitt.
Fight
club is about two men who start an underground fighting cult.  It is rated
R
by the MPAA for disturbing graphic violence, strong sexual content, and
heavy profanity.  Overall fight club is a great movie I gave it a 10/10.
WHO IS TYLER DURDEN!?
