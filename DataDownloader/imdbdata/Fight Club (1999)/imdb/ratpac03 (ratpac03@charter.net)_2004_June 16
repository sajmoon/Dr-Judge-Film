Yes, I did mean that. And yes, I have seen a LOT of movies.<br /><br />One of the quick complaints to dispel is that it's a &quot;complain-fest&quot; as
one reviewer-said. No, this is NOT a movie about the middle class white
man being held down. It's a movie about responsibility,
cause-and-effect, and what happens when you do nothing with your life
and just let yourself slide into a hole without even once scraping to
get out.<br /><br />That said, as others have mentioned, very little can be said of this
movie. The fight scenes are not like most movies, intended to be action
sequences as a nice break between plot development, they're as much a
part of the story as anything else. Ed Norton is our &quot;protagonist&quot; of
sorts who finds his life miserable and eventually meets the one and
only Tyler Durden.<br /><br />Fight Club, coincidentally enough, gained success much like the
following inside the movie itself. The ads for it were terrible, making
it look like a mindless action movie. Reviews seemed half-hearted. I
didn't know many people who saw it in theaters. But after renting the
DVD on a suggestion, I actually felt changed. VERY few movies can alter
your perception of the world around you like this one can. By the time
the credits were rolling, my heart was pumping furiously.<br /><br />Do not watch this movie unless you can sit down and watch it without
interruption. It's not a party movie, nor one to watch with someone who
has already seen it unless they stay silent. The beauty of this movie
is the shock as the scenes go on. It's a tornado of a movie, where we
get to watch the decay of a man. Each scene is more unraveled and
chaotic than the one before it. Each shot is done perfectly, the
filming style and the color is gorgeous (in its own sick way), the
sound and music are a perfect match. I can watch this movie at any time
and not get sick of it.<br /><br />Again, watch this movie. And don't have any preconceived notions,
because guaranteed this movie will surprise you.
