The Pixies' song, &quot;Where is My Mind&quot; (from the Surfer Rosa album) provides a
perfect soundtrack to the final scene of Fight Club.  I was already
convinced of the movie's greatness, but when I heard the first few notes of
&quot;Where is My Mind,&quot; my opinion was confirmed.  What a great artistic choice
to have the buildings collapse to that song.  Bravo!
