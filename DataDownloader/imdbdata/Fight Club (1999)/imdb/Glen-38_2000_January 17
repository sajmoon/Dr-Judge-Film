Fight Club is an incredible film which, along with Se7en and The Game,
propels David Fincher into my fave directors list.<br /><br />This is a fantastic satire on modern life and living, which succeeds through
great acting, a great script and, as already mentioned, good
direction.<br /><br />The movie flies along with twists and turns that keep the interest alive,
while managing to ask questions about society, as it provides us with fight
sequences to keep eye candy people (or yobs) happy.  So everybody
wins.<br /><br />Watch it, it is excellent, without doubt one of the finest films of
1999.
