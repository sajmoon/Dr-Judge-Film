It's tempting to judge a film that has a lead character (Pitt) spouting
antisocial rhetoric on these terms alone. Antisocial rhetoric. Not many
films with a $50+mil budget have the audacity to do it, even though it
could make money because it inherently appeals to Nazi Punks and boys
who don't like their dishwashing money taken away. When does all this
come into the movie though? Surely further than half way. What precedes
it? Other things. It is not about 'finding yourself after you've lost
everything' like so many on both sides claim. By the end, The Narrator
doesn't like anything Tyler's done. He is sick of it -- just like he
was sick of his corporate existence. He is growing, moving on. <br /><br />&quot;You met me at a very strange time in my life.&quot;, indeed.
