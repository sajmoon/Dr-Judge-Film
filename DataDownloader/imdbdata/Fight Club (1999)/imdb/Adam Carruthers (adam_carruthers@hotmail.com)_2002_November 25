Fight Club. What can be said about the film that has not been said
before,
positive and negative comments sufficing. Each person however interprets
things differently. I see a film in a different light to you. Therefore
there can be a never-ending source of praise or criticism for fight club.
If
you have not read the book then read it. If you have not listened to the
soundtrack then listen to it. If you have not watched fight club then
watch
it. Mr. Palahniuck portrays a narrator in the story who has deep seeded
problems to such an extent even Sigmund Freund who be baffled by him. Or
not. The narrator is someone who could be you or me. ANYBODY. Perhaps
that
is why he remains nameless because he is a personification of all humans.
Someone who works his 8-8 shifts at work. Goes home and does jack s**t.
Somebody who has no meaning in life. Im not going to go into the book or
watch the film but if you read/watch it you will realize that each and
every
one of us is dangerous and we do have a meaning to our own individual
self
and to society.
