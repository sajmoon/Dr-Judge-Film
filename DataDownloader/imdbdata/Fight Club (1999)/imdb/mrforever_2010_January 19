Now, believe me when I say, Fight Club is hands down one of the most
complex, thematically-rich films of the 90s. It&#x27;s this decade&#x27;s most
profound piece of movie making as well as being one of this decade&#x27;s
most original. Unfortunately, due to its uniqueness, an audience will
be hard to pinpoint. The same target audience that it speaks to also
might not understand its deep-seated themes. Fight Club is one of those
rare films that has so much to say that one viewing will not be able to
absorb all of it. The acting is superb and enviable. All of the
characters in the movie have something to say that adds to the
development of the story. The camera work and graphics are outstanding.
The effects are useful at grabbing the viewer&#x27;s attention. As I said
earlier, this movie is truly unique. It&#x27;s not a corny underdog story
about some man fighting to get a girl or prove a point. But it is the
uprising of one particular class of underlying men who feel they are
&#x22;the middle child of god&#x22;. Fight club relies on it&#x27;s wit, shock value
and dialogue to create a controversial atmosphere that holds the
viewer&#x27;s attention. There are so many underlying morals and messages in
this story, it&#x27;s almost impossible to pin point all of them. I truly
recommend watching this film, I give it a 9/10.
