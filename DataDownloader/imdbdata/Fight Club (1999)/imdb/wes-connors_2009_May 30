According to the official studio synopsis, David Fincher&#x27;s film is
described: &#x22;A ticking-time-bomb insomniac (Edward Norton) and a
slippery soap salesman (Brad Pitt) channel primal male aggression into
a shocking new form of therapy. Their concept catches on, with
underground &#x22;fight clubs&#x22; forming in every town - until a sensuous and
mysterious woman (Helena Bonham Carter) comes between the two men and
ignites an out-of-control spiral toward oblivion.&#x22; Meatloaf again. <br /><br />As you&#x27;ll discover, the film&#x27;s official synopsis isn&#x27;t even remotely
correct; but, it&#x27;s a good way to &#x22;sell&#x22; &#x22;Fight Club&#x22;. This film is
violent and *pornographic* - this is a WARNING - but, except for Jared
Leto&#x27;s silly putty face make-up, the cast cleans up well. The beatings
are brutal, but help make the film&#x27;s point, and are a part of the
protagonist&#x27;s madness. &#x22;Fight Club&#x22; is a comedy about the lead
character&#x27;s rejection of society&#x27;s domestication of his life. Or, it
could be about something else...<br /><br />To Be a Man.<br /><br />The film received an &#x22;Academy Award&#x22; nomination for the &#x22;Sound Effects&#x22;
by Richard Hymns and Ren Klyce (beaten by the first &#x22;Matrix&#x22; and the
latest &#x22;Star Wars&#x22;). &#x22;Fight Club&#x22; is excellent in many ways, but isn&#x27;t
(and shouldn&#x27;t be) as polished a &#x22;production&#x22; as 1999&#x27;s big winner,
&#x22;American Beauty&#x22; - a film which opened simultaneously, and presented
critics with more palpable male angst. &#x22;Supporting Actress&#x22; Carter
deserved some consideration for her memorable &#x22;Marla&#x22;; she even sings
gets in a few lines from the &#x22;(Theme From) Valley of the Dolls&#x22;.<br /><br />********** Fight Club (9/10/99) David Fincher ~ Edward Norton, Brad
Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf
