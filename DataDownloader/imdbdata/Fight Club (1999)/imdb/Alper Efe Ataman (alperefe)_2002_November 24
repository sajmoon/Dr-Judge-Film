Some people hate it, some people adore. To me, Fight Club is the best
movie
I've ever seen. First, the scenario is great, based on Chuck Palahniuk's
great novel. The characters, (Marla) Helena Bonham Carter, (the narrator)
Edward Norton &amp; (Tyler Durden) Brad Pitt (Yes, in Tyler we trust!) have
done
a great job. The movie contains some anarchist conversations, those all
made
me think about the way we live (you may think like afterall this is only a
movie, but after you watch it, you would feel the similar way I do) also
amazed me, as it is very hard job to make those kind of films working with
some big Hollywood Studios, and companies (Even that was mentioned in  Jim
Carrey's best film, The Majestic). Other than that, the scenes, the story
excluding the anarchist parts are also great, with its psychological
points.
Fight Club, should be David Fincher's best effort, also would sign its
name
on &quot;the best movies ever list&quot;. If you haven't seen this fascinating
movie,
you are not even living...
&quot;Only after you've lost everything, you are free to do anything; because
things you own, end up owning you..!&quot;
