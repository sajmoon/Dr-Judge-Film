The first time I watched Dave Fincher's magnum opus Fight Club, I was
overwhelmed with such emotion like never before.  The radical new thoughts,
the unforgettable dialogue, and the now classic characters of the Narrator
(not Jack), Marla, and of course, Tyler Durden.  I decided to watch the
film
again, and the second time is much BETTER than the first.  One notices all
kinds of new details, and the character dialogue is much funnier, and the
story line more intriguing.  This movie will never get old to me.  It is a
modern classic and will someday be in the ranks of the greatest film ever
made, The Godfather.
