I&#x27;m not above juvenile humor. The 40 Year Old Virgin and Forgetting
Sarah Marshall were at times tasteless, often juvenile, and hilarious.
Knocked Up, less so, but with more heart. Wedding Crashers was laugh
out loud funny a lot of the time as it continue to go way too far.<br /><br />I laughed maybe....*maybe* three times at most during this movie.
Including the supposedly &#x22;laugh so hard&#x22; sequence during the credits.
The characters are unlikeable, the plot is basically &#x22;Dude Where&#x27;s My
Car&#x22; in Vegas, and the jokes fall way flat. That several notable
critics think this movie is great either means that I haven&#x27;t had
nearly enough drunken misadventures to relate to this film or that
there is a &#x22;stupid&#x22; pandemic in this country that puts swine flu to
shame.<br /><br />For anyone who hasn&#x27;t seen this movie yet and is unsure whether to
trust the negative reviews or the positive reviews, I say this. Find
someone who has seen this movie whose opinion on movies you almost
always agree with. If they say you&#x27;ll like it, go and see it and join
in with the stupids who find this rehashed tripe hilarious. If you&#x27;re
going based on hype, you may end up as disappointed as I was.<br /><br />Oh and BTW, there&#x27;s no way this movie belongs anywhere near the Top 250
of all time. It&#x27;s not in the Top 250 of this decade, though it&#x27;s
solidly in the Top 10 of worst movies I&#x27;ve ever paid to see.
