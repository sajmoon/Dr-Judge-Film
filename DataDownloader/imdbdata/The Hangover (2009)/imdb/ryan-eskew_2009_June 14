I didn&#x27;t plan on seeing the movie in theaters but after everybody
telling me the movie was the funniest movie they had seen in years and
even IMDb having it in the top 250 I thought I would give a try.<br /><br />I saw the trailer for the Hangover months ago and my immediate
impression was not full of high expectations. Everybody who has been
completely hammered before knows that even on their worst night of
drinking you usually don&#x27;t wake up with a baby in the closet and a
tiger in the bathroom. The comedy just seemed a bit far stretched and
forced.<br /><br />I did laugh pretty hard for the first 10 minutes but after the
beginning the humor dwindled. Halfway through the movie my friend
leaned over and commented on how ridiculous the storyline was and I
couldn&#x27;t agree more. <br /><br />The annoying thing about the movie was that the humor was not
intelligent (except for Zack Galifianakis). If your a fan of Zack G.
then you know his stand-up is brilliant and hilarious but the movie as
a whole will let you down. Though i will say Zach G. made the movie
worth watching. <br /><br />I was hoping to see a movie that topped Wedding Crashers or Pineapple
Express but the movie didn&#x27;t even come close. The movie was not
horrible but top 250 come on!? thats insulting. <br /><br />If your a big fan of intelligent comedies I wouldn&#x27;t waste your time at
the theater and wait for it to come out on DVD. This movie is a classic
case of mainstream comedy that will top the box offices but just
doesn&#x27;t deliver.
