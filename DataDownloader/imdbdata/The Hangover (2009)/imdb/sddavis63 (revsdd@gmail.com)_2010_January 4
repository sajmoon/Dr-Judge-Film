This movie is certainly aptly titled. Essentially it tells the story of
four buddies who head out to Las Vegas for a couple of days for a
bachelor party (because one of them is about to get married) and then
have to spend the second day figuring out what they did on the first
day because they got so totally wasted that they can&#x27;t remember. One of
them (the groom) has disappeared, one got married to a stripper, one
ended up in the hospital and one found a tiger in their hotel bathroom!
It was quite a weekend!<br /><br />There&#x27;s no doubt that it is funny at times. The scene where &#x22;Mr. Chow&#x22;
jumps totally naked out of the trunk of their car had me in stitches.
Having said that, it was also rather crude much of the time and
sometimes came across as very much similar to a sophomoric-type comedy,
which I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s intended to be. It seems more inclined to be
going for a more mature audience, but for me at least too many of the
characters and situations just came across as ridiculously implausible
rather than funny. The first twenty minutes or so I found especially
difficult to get through, as it takes that long for anything even
remotely funny to begin to happen, and the same can be said for the
last few scenes, although I did appreciate the moment when Stu (the guy
who married the stripper) finally kicked his obsessively controlling
girlfriend out of his life. It&#x27;s not a disastrous movie, and - yes - it
is quite funny at times. Just not enough of the time. 4/10
