After seeing the movie I was so unimpressed I felt like writing an
ironic review praising the fine acting and exquisite plot in this film.
However, since it&#x27;s currently in the IMDb top 250 and number one in the
US box office, being a bit more serious seems like a better choice
since I think the irony probably would be lost on most people.<br /><br />The Hangover is about four guys who go to Las Vegas to attend one of
the guy&#x27;s bachelor party. They have a wild night and wake up the next
morning not being able to remember a single thing from the previous
night. This setup could possibly make for a somewhat entertaining film,
however they have failed on this one. Out of the running time I think I
laughed about two times. It&#x27;s a very excruciating thing to watch a film
where even one joke falls flat, in this one which is supposed to be a
comedy they turn into string combos of jokes that simply aren&#x27;t funny.<br /><br />The humor is crude, sexist, violent, and still without going ever going
over the line which is a problem. Comedies that go over the line, like
Borat for example really is my cup of tea, but The Hangover never
really dares to venture there. For example you are supposed to think
the fat guy is funny because he is weird and stupid, although he comes
off as too pathetic for it to be funny.<br /><br />The plot never draws you in since one does not feel anything for the
main characters, they are all unlikeable in their own unique way. In
movies it&#x27;s important to have a logical thread going through the entire
film, and not introduce too many random characters or events that are
not motivated, especially not in the later half or so. In The Hangover
way too many characters and situations are just randomly inserted which
I suppose is meant to be goofy and hilarious, but it just comes off as
bad scriptwriting.<br /><br />Worst of all though, and what really puts me off in The Hangover is the
glorified picture of Las Vegas it produces, which unfortunately is very
common in the mass media today. Las Vegas appears to be a paradise on
Earth, where you come to have fun, win lots of money, and still leave
with a smile on your face, no matter what happens. Because, what
happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. Well, let me tell you something: I&#x27;ve
been to Las Vegas. Never in my life have I been to a more horrid place.
I would never ever want to go there again. To me Las Vegas really
embodies all the bad parts of the American culture. Nothing feels real
there, it&#x27;s all about surface and everything has this plastic,
artificial feeling to it. Commerce is what it&#x27;s all about there, spend
money or lose it by gambling. None of this matters though, because most
of the average joes watching this film will never go there, so film
makers can continue to picture Las Vegas in this almost mythological
way.
