2011_July 20 
After the reaction that this film created I thought that it was about
time I watched it - two years after its release. The name of the film
made me believe the humour would be entirely predictable and probably a
bit too crude. I was expecting to see the best comedy of the past
decade because of people&#x27;s amazement when I could say &#x27;I have never
seen &#x22;The Hangover&#x27; and I can now say that I don&#x27;t regret my rather
late viewing of the film.<br /><br />I was disappointed by the film&#x27;s humour, there were too few &#x27;laugh out
loud&#x27; moments and I thought that because of this the film just seemed
to drag on and on. I would not call it boring, but I would certainly
call it mediocre.<br /><br />The acting was of a fairly decent quality, Bradley Cooper seems to have
come out of nowhere, although I seem to be the only person who
remembers him from &#x22;Wedding Crashers&#x22;. I have never particularly liked
him as an actor, partially because of his arrogant presence on the
screen, and this, for me, it a problem in the film. I found the other
two of the main characters to be fairly sound, and seeing Heather
Graham was a breath of fresh air. It was nice to see her in a
major(ish) film, her first since &#x22;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged
Me&#x22; over ten years ago.<br /><br />While the above is for the most part fairly negative, it was still a
film that you could watch from start to finish while not feeling bored
at its end. My particular part was a certain cameo appearance which was
probably the highlight of the film, as this made the fairly crude
humour to be more ridiculous and entertaining, which was definitely
needed.<br /><br />All in all, &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; is worth a watch, but don&#x27;t expect to see
the best comedy of your life, because realistically it is not better
than most of the other comedies coming out at the moment.
