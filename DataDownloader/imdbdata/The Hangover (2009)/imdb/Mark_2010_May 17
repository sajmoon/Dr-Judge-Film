The most overrated film since Pulp Fiction. A bunch of morons running
around dropping F-bombs is not funny to me. Total waste of film and
resources. I found myself saying to myself,&#x22;This has to get better
soon.&#x22; The script could have been written by any foul mouthed 10 year
old, there was very little plot originality whatsoever in this movie.
If it were not for the 17 to 30 year old crowd, this film would not
have made it past its third weekend.<br /><br />Movies like this one are an example of the downfall and/or decline of
Hollywood. It seems like they throw these types of movies together and
hype them to death and the young crowd always falls for it. I am sorry
I wasted my valuable time on this garbage.
