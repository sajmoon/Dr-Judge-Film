I realize there&#x27;s an audience for crass, juvenile comedies, and while I
myself don&#x27;t enjoy them, I am capable of understanding what it is about
them that amuses some people. I might even manage a chuckle or two
while watching one (always under duress and never by choice). &#x22;The
Hangover,&#x22; however, baffles me. It is so witless, so humorless, so
vulgar, and so senseless, its success astounds me. I can&#x27;t imagine
anyone not having undergone a lobotomy finding anything remotely funny
about this film, which doesn&#x27;t come close to fulfilling the potential
of its plot. How it grossed nearly $500 million at the box office is
beyond my comprehension. Had I paid to see it, I would demand a refund.
As it is, I feel everyone associated with it owes me the 90 minutes of
my life I lost watching it, sticking with it to the end only because I
needed to see if there was at least one laugh before the final credits.
Trust me, there isn&#x27;t.
