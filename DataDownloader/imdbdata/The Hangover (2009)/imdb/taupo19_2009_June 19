Considering the hype and 4 star reviews I went to this movie hoping for
something more then a remake of Swingers and more adult then the
endless juvenile &#x27;we&#x27;re going to swear and talk about gay things to
shock the audience&#x27; movies that seem to be prolific at the moment - I
can honestly say I didn&#x27;t smile once during the whole movie - and I
loved Swingers! Getting embarrassed over a breast feeding Mother and an
elderly patients butt - Oh please! Hollywood needs to grow up - they
were making movies like this when I was in my teens (Porky&#x27;s) - get
your noses out of your school boy fantasies and try and make a decent
movie next time will you? Something with a little wit and intelligence
if you don&#x27;t mind.
