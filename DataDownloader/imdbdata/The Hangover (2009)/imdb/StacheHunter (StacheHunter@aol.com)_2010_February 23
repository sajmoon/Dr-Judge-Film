Undoubtedly there will be no love shown for this review. It&#x27;s way past
the expiration date for this movie, since it&#x27;s nothing more than a
cookie-cutter &#x22;comedy&#x22; made exclusively for a male demographic audience
between 18 and oh, the mid-twenties. Granted, I only had to watch about
twenty minutes of this drivel before shutting it off since it was
plainly obvious that the &#x22;comedy&#x22; consisted of obnoxious sight gags and
homophobic jokes. There were at least five &#x22;faggot&#x22; jokes in the first
twenty minutes this crapfest ran across my flatscreen, which I suppose
were designed to make me double up with laughter and crack open another
beer. I knew the movie was in trouble when the now-appointed &#x22;breakout&#x22;
star Zack Somethingorother yelled at the fitter &#x22;you&#x27;re getting too
close to my shaft&#x22; and then dropped his pants to display some kind of
jockstrap undies, and then embrace the groom only to be &#x22;caught&#x22; by the
bride&#x27;s father who responds &#x22;I knew it&#x22;. This is not funny, it&#x27;s
predictable and works on basically a fourth grade level of humor. What
next, pies in the face for the maximum yuck yuck factor? I&#x27;d rather see
that than wallow in the blatant un-PC glee which &#x22;The Hangover&#x22;
embraces with such ferocity. American comedy is doomed if this is the
best Hollywood can offer.
