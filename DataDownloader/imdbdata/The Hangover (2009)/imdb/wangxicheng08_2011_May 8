I am critical person and I think this movie isn&#x27;t bad movie, but Do not
deserve 7.9/10. I think it&#x27;s like 5.9 last year, how in the world it
goes up so much? Hangover 2 is coming up? So, this movie&#x27;s story is
just not a surprise. The director wants to keep a big secret, but he
cannot think out of any better idea. When i knew what happened at the
end.I regret I spent 2 hours on this. This is a story that any body can
come out with. Definitely a super-boring story. The people who think
it&#x27;s funny is just because some scene are funny. So, compare to other
7.9 movie, you will see this movie doesn&#x27;t look like a 7.9 at all.
Since hangover 2 is based on the same idea as 1, i think it will be as
boring as the previous one.
