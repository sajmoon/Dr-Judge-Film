2009_July 20 
As a long standing admirer of movies and acting, I do enjoy my comedies
(as the doctors say, laughter is the best medicine!) Sure, the face of
comedy has changed from the sophisticated seventies of Annie Hall, but
that isn&#x27;t a bad thing either&#x85;which brings me to the Bro-com or
Bromance as I prefer. We&#x27;ve seen its early stages from Road Trip, Old
School, Anchorman, The 40-Year-Old Virgin and blooming into gems such
as Role Models, I Love You, Man &#x26; now the classic Hangover! (God, I
still can&#x27;t stop laughing as I&#x27;m writing this&#x85;)And before you ask, I
have seen this film 6 times already and aim to watch it even more upon
its DVD release sometime in October (lucky guess I think).<br /><br />From the posts I&#x27;ve read on this thread, I would agree with some
opinions, such as the fact that The Hangover is Sex and the City for
men &#x96; but funny. It proves again that when a bunch of guys get together
(as wonderfully illustrated in this film) that they&#x27;re not leering at
women from afar in Benny Hill fashion; but paying them cheeky
compliments along the way: &#x22;Excuse me Ma&#x27;am, in the leopard dress, you
have an amazing rack!&#x22; says Bradley Cooper&#x27;s Phil Wenneck on a
megaphone. I won&#x27;t recap the scenario for you, as I am sure 95% of the
USA has seen this already! Oh, and don&#x27;t get me started on dweebs who
say that the tiger in the backseat is unreal &#x96; IT&#x27;S A COMEDY for crying
out loud! It&#x27;s the same with Stu Price confronting the tiger in the
bathroom and screaming like a girl when giving him his raw meat. The
laughter would&#x27;ve been lost if he simply threw the morsel at the
animal.<br /><br />Why I embrace the Bromance so much is that it outlines women&#x27;s faults
as much as ours. In I Love You, Man Rashida Jones&#x27;s Zoe thinks it&#x27;s
fine for her to gossip with girlfriends about her sex life with Peter
Klaven (Paul Rudd) but he can&#x27;t behave in the same manner with his male
pals. The same goes for Ed Helms&#x27;s (Stu Price) and the fact that his
Antichrist girlfriend won&#x27;t let him have a lads weekend away; but it&#x27;s
okay for her to sleep with a bartender! It also illustrates America&#x27;s
constant homophobia issues and luckily, it&#x27;s acceptable for straight
men to declare their brotherly love without worrying about waking up in
bed together! What grates on my nerves are people who express their
disapproval about so-called gay bashing in this and other movies such
as The 40-Year-Old Virgin. This is comedy after all and you cannot be
politically correct to please your demographic audience, that&#x27;s just
plain silly. Lines such as: &#x22;Paging Doctor Faggot!&#x22; are simply
hilarious, because it&#x27;s mocking that character&#x27;s stupidity, not making
fun of homosexuals. If you&#x27;re gay and want to be offended, go and watch
Bruno with Sacha Baron Cohen or Beerfest where they do nothing but
reinforce the stereotype. If people start to nitpick about the flack
racial/religious/sexual groups receive from comedies, then what will
you eventually make fun of? I am actually mixed-race myself and have
never taken offence to a classic comedy where the majority of the
players are white. In fact, I welcome these movies than drivel such as
Pooty Tang &#x26; A Thin Line Between Love &#x26; Hate (4.7/10 on IMDb&#x27;s start
rating?). Oh, and Bad Boys &#x96; unfunny, shouting and self indulgent.<br /><br />What makes The Hangover an instant classic is the casting &#x26; chemistry
with all the leads (and Todd Phillips&#x27;s hilarious cameo). Bradley
Cooper, whose character of Zachary &#x22;Sack&#x22; Lodge in Wedding Crashers was
such a douche-bag, but played the part to perfection&#x85;in other words, he
was unforgettable. I was surprised at his casting initially, but the
man can play comedy very well and gets a few good laughs, as I have
mentioned already. He seems like a stand-up guy in real life and look
forward to seeing more of the Coopster in the future! Ed Helms is also
phenomenal in his role as Stu &#x96; and quite sympathetic at times as well.
Don&#x27;t know much about him but believe me, I am a convert now and will
be watching The Office as soon as possible. Great comic timing and
delivery doesn&#x27;t hurt your appeal, does it? Zach Galifianakis: I used
to watch him in Tru Calling but had no idea he was so funny! Yes, he&#x27;s
out of shape but that makes him more believable and his deadpan humour
gives this movie some of its funniest moments &#x96; including the threat of
not being afraid to beat-up an old man at the gas station or &#x22;the side
effects of Roofies is memory loss, remember?&#x22; or the side-splittingly
hilarious &#x22;I didn&#x27;t know they gave out rings in the Holocaust?&#x22; Justin
Bartha as (white) Doug: He didn&#x27;t have a lot to do in this film, but as
a testimony to visual comedy, his red face in the end is something else
&#x96; and pretty sure his on screen bride-to-be couldn&#x27;t keep a straight
face either! The thing I love about this comedy is that unlike Sex and
the City, these guys have ordinary professions (except for Alan &#x26; Doug,
whom we don&#x27;t find anything about) -which makes it easier as an
audience to bond with and best of all, is the shared dynamic they all
have. Also, the fact that you miss comedic moments the first time,
means you&#x27;ll savour them on repeated viewing. A great chemistry and a
comedy that doesn&#x27;t apologise when it comes down to using a baby for a
jack-off joke! Let&#x27;s hope Hangover 2 is as good as or surpasses this
milestone classic. Todd Phillips, we salute you! PS: Ken Jeong&#x85;what a
legend and a great sport for understanding the values of being in a
R-rated comedy. His &#x22;So long gay boys&#x22; line will forever be on my
cellphone when the DVD is released!
