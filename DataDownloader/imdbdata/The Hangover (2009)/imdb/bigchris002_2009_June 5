2009_June 5 
I have to start by saying that my friends and I have been talking about
this movie and watching the trailers for weeks, so our expectations
were really high.<br /><br />With that being said, this movie didn&#x27;t just live up to the
expectations, it was one of the funniest movie I have seen in a long
time. Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, and Ed Helms are all very
good. Galifianakis steals the show at times. It is hilarious from the
beginning. Mike Tyson brings a few laughs and Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) is a
great twist. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie, it is worth
every penny. Just got out of the midnight showing and I&#x27;m going back
tomorrow night.
