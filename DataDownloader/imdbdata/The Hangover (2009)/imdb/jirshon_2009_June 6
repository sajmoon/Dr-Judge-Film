I walked into this movie a little hesitant, and man did I feel like a
complete tool for doubting Todd Phillips once again.<br /><br />I was hesitant for quite a few reasons. One being that I was a little
unimpressed with the trailer, but trust me, after you see this movie
you will realize that most of the movie couldn&#x27;t have possibly made it
into the trailer. Another reason was the writers.... their previous
works being The Ghosts of Girlfriend&#x27;s Pasts and Four Christmases and
Rebound. I don&#x27;t know what they did between those and this but damn did
they step their game up.<br /><br />Now, the movie is hilarious. I have become so used to the thought of
the Judd Apatow gang being the only ones to make truly funny films, but
I realized very quickly into this movie that I was dead wrong. I think
this movie was by far ten times funnier than Pineapple Express,
Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Step Brothers, etc. And I find each of those
flicks truly, hilariously, funny.<br /><br />I remember watching Superbad the first time and thinking that that was
the funniest movie ever made, when it comes to films with legitimate
plots and characters, etc. And maybe Superbad and The Hangover are
pretty close, but who knows....<br /><br />So PLEASE see this film. The audience I saw it with was laughing
hysterically every five minutes at least. There is enough one-liners to
quote all summer, and enough subtle jokes to laugh about later on that
you didn&#x27;t catch the first time.<br /><br />OH and by the way, if you love Old School, you will LOVE the ending.
That&#x27;s all I can say.
