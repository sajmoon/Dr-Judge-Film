Okay...I&#x27;m still trying to figure out why everyone thought this movie
was *so* funny. Because it wasn&#x27;t. At all. Harold &#x26; Kumar go to White
Castle is FUNNY. American Pie is FUNNY. Animal House is FUNNY. National
Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation is FUNNY. Monty Python is FUNNY! This
movie is NOT funny. This movie drags on and on and on. There ARE some
funny parts but other than that it&#x27;s worthless. It&#x27;s slow, boring and
uneventful. The best thing this movie has to offer is the soundtrack.
The events that take place in this movie are completely unbelievable
and just stupid. DON&#x27;T RENT THIS MOVIE...unless you have nothing better
to do with your life.
