I use the F word on occasion, I like Curb Your Enthusiasm which is
loaded with curses and pretty bad ones but they don&#x27;t seem to grate...I
mean really really GRATE!!! The dialogue assault was like a jet engine
in your living room for pain to your ears. <br /><br />Other than that the plot was totally juvenile and pitifully inane. I
can only think the people who liked this movie are the same people who
poop on the seats of public toilets. I don&#x27;t understand the amusement
they got from this flick. Change 2 letters from the last word and that
is the word the director would have insisted on solely for the sake of
saying it for the 1400th time. Really it was painful and strangely
enough we are probably not allowed to use the most common language of
the movie to review the movie. If we were I probably would use it to
make a point. Even Lenny Bruce could not have saved this f*k, (thats
short for flick of course, and I am not LOL about anything). To sum it
up A. People rate this flick high.B. I really don&#x27;t understand people.
