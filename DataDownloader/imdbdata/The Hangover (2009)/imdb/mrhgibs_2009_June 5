After much anticipation, The Hangover has finally hit theaters. Todd
Phillips returns raunchier than ever with a surprisingly consistent
comedy loaded with bizarre situations ensued by lots of laughter. From
a live tiger in the bathroom to an abandoned baby in the closet, this
movie has everything. Seriously, everything (confirmed by the credit
sequence).<br /><br />Phillips does not shy away from his formula. The movie centers around
four immature adults dumbfounded by the seemingly unexplainable result
of a wild Vegas night catalyzed by the foursome&#x27;s out of control
bachelor party. Set the day before one of the principle character&#x27;s
wedding, the film is primarily seen through eyes of Doug (the
groom-to-be), Alan (the lovable moron), Stu (the hopeless one), and
Phil (the stud, and in many ways the leader of the pack). The director
of Old School does not shy away from shock humor but embraces it, while
gradually building confidence and self discovery within the characters. <br /><br />Overall, the film triumphs through curiosity and chemistry. Just like
the main characters, we are eager to find out what happens, or what DID
happen. At the same time, the strong relationship developed by the
characters makes the viewer realize how much he/she cares about what
ultimately happens to them. Chemistry is the secret to a good comedy;
it is about time somebody shows this understanding.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t want to reveal too much, but let me tell you this: everything
does get explained in the end (except for the chicken aimlessly walking
around in the hotel room, but I mean, it&#x27;s a chicken). All of the
actors succeeded in their roles admirably, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised
to see these guys in more lead roles. Ed Helms hasn&#x27;t made me laugh
this hard since The Daily Show. Seriously guys. Go watch this movie,
you won&#x27;t be disappointed.
