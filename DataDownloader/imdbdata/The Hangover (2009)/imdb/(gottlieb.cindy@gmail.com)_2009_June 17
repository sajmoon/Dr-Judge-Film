This movie gets funnier as the story unfolds. I haven&#x27;t seen a movie as
funny as this in too many years! 3 friends and the weird brother of the
bride go to Las Vegas for a bachelor party. When they wake up from a
wild night on the strip, there is a baby and a tiger in their
spectacular suite at Cesaer&#x27;s Palace. Phil has a hospital name band on,
Stu, the dentist, has lost a tooth and a valuable heirloom, Alan has
lost his underwear (if that is what you call what he wears under his
pants) and they have all lost the groom, Doug. The escapades to find
Doug are over the top hilarious! As they retrace their steps through
events and people, they find out happened and it just gets funnier. The
ending credits are a must watch too! From start to finish, there is
never a non-laugh moment... a pee-in-your-pants movie. A MUST SEE
movie!
