This piece of crap. The writers and actors should be shot. Homophobic
humor condones and incites anti-gay violence. If anti-Black slurs had
been used in this movie the way anti-gay slurs were, this movie would
NEVER have been released. It&#x27;s THIS kind of anti-gay &#x22;culture&#x22; that
leads to gay teen SUICIDES. It&#x27;s NOT funny, It&#x27;s NOT OK. If I ever meet
the writers or the cast in person, I swear I will punch them in the
face. They deserve to be shot. Let them say all the other slurs, too.
Got one for Jews? I do. Got one for Italians? There&#x27;s one of those,
too. How about women? Koreans? Japanese? Indians? Developmentally
Disabled? SLURS KILL. And if there is any justice, all the assholes
connected with this movie will get theirs, too.
