did not find it hysterical to see the typical negative hurtful
portrayals of black, Asian, native-American, etc. spending millions of
dollars on creating these destructive images. there are a lot of great
movies. i only take the time to respond to ones that are hurtful.
spending money - one hopes to have a good fun movie experience.
everyone should be able to take a joke. but this is yet another example
of insensitive ignorant group of white guys doing their &#x22;thing&#x22;. you
should have a warning label: if you&#x27;re not of a specific demographic
and don&#x27;t have a specific set of core values: than don&#x27;t see this
movie. that would have been helpful. however, it seems that a little
more these days, a few are excerising some conscience. these very
typical white writers and director are not one of them.
