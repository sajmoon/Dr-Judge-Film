When i saw that IMDb rating for this movie was 8.2/10 i believed that
this film didn&#x27;t deserve such a rating. I thought that 8/10 is too much
for a comedy film. <br /><br />When i saw the movie, i was laughing all the time... The perfect
screenplay of Jon Lucas and Scott Moore had so many funny parts in this
crazy story ! Smart humor and sex-comedies scenes were so funny .<br /><br />Todd Philips did a great job in directing, once again. Bradley Cooper
was a really weird school teacher . Ed Helms was the serious guy of the
film. Zach Galifianakis was the crazy character of this movie. Justin
Bartha ... the lost guy... Very good acting from all of them (
especially Zach...) Also a strong supporting cast like Heather Graham,
Ken Jeong, Jeffrey Tambor, Rachael Harris, Mike Epps and of course...
the baby! (Carlos/Tyler) was so funny.<br /><br />Nice job from everyone and ... Thank you for this amazing night in Las
Vegas! <br /><br />For one of the best ever comedies ... 10/10 .
