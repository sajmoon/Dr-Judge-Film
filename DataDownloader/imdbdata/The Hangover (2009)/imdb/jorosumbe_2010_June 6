I&#x27;ve read a lot of positive reviews on the Hangover but managed to get
only a few laughs while watching it. Not much of entertainment,
originality, surprise, and most importantly humour. At the end of it, I
was left with the suspicion that the whole thing was a badly made
commercial for the Vegas Blvd and having spent more than a month there,
I am telling you it is not worth it (unless you enjoy the cheap &#x22;bling&#x22;
of the concrete hotels and plastic hookers).<br /><br />What surprised me the most was the high score on IMDb (7,9 form roughly
120,000 users by the time I submit this review) that easily surpasses
my comedy favourite for 2009 - Funny People. C&#x27;mon IMDb, you are losing
it.<br /><br />Honestly, you have to be of the intellectual capacity of Mike Tyson to
enjoy this one...
