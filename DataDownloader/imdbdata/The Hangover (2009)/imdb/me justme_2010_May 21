This movie is just awful Unoriginal, derivative, idiotic and a
semi-ripoff of Very Bad Things that was actually funny. There is not
one laugh in this film. i am utterly shocked at the good reviews It
stinks. The flick is a very very very boring exposition of a few guys
going to Vegas and getting into trouble. (Does this sound like Very Bad
Things or what? There is no laughter in this film at all I am shocked
that it made any money whatsoever. RIP OFF BEWARE How on earth this
movie got backing is Way beyond me. It&#x27;s an odor generating mess that
isn&#x27;t funny Avaois at all costs. You will hate yourself for renting or
buying this atrocity. Stay away.
