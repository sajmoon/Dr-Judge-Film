This movie is completely brainless. I don&#x27;t think that a movie filled
with toilet jokes without a hint of intelligence is necessarily bad.
Sometimes it&#x27;s good to watch something like Down the Periscope, Police
Academy or the like. But usually those movies have a corresponding
rating on IMDb. I do not see how Hangover is in any way superior to any
of the movies of its kind. It is forgettable and bland. I do not say
that it is completely unfunny, but neither is it original. If you need
to waste about 2 hours of your life, while drinking a couple of beers
with friends this movie is not a bad choice (although not the best in
my opinion), but you would also not miss a thing if you never watched
Hangover.
