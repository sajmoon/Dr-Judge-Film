A few helpful suggestions for how to make a movie as successful as &#x22;The
Hangover&#x22;:<br /><br />1) Don&#x27;t make your characters likable. Instead, make them annoying,
selfish, and petty.<br /><br />2) Don&#x27;t be afraid to indulge in a little sexism. &#x22;The Hangover&#x22; is a
movie for the guys, and many guys secretly harbor low opinions of the
women they date, marry, or otherwise know. Provide some female
characters who can confirm these opinions: an annoying harridan of a
fianc&#xE9;e, a stripper, etc.<br /><br />3) Don&#x27;t be afraid of a little racism either. If all your stars are
white, you can expect your audience to be white, so it&#x27;s okay to show
off some stereotypes of Asians and Latinos in your film.<br /><br />4) Don&#x27;t make it funny! This is the most important one. Rather than
clever jokes or memorable slapstick routines, provide your viewers with
painful gags, obvious one-liners, and grating sarcasm, while generally
soaking your film with a feeling of negativity. Abuse your characters,
actors, and audience as much as possible. You will only hurt them
because you love them so much.
