I thought this movie was total trash! Not funny at all. Just a bunch of
stupid frat boy humor. I was actually depressed watching it, because it
just goes to show you how low our society has sunk. Seems that
Hollywood has no limits anymore on how to make money off of sex, drugs,
exploiting women, and lack of caring for animals and children. This is
just mindless garbage. The lead character (Bradley Cooper) is also
extremely annoying. He plays a Dick in every show he is in, and I have
a hard time believing it is far from reality. It is actually insulting
to the general public that the majority of people that went to see this
movie gave it such high ratings. stupid and sad!
