The Hangover was hilarious! I was never never bored, and it was the
funniest move I have ever seen! The characters were hilarious and the
actors were very well chosen for the part. My favorite was the dude
with the beard! He was awesome! The plot was also very interesting. It
always kept my attention and I was even nervous for the ending. I have
never heard so man funny and interesting comments in one movie. I
definitely recommend watching this movie. I will for sure be buying it
the day it comes out! I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to
laugh. It was extremely hilarious and is great for anyone over the age
of 13! Go see this movie it was absolutely awesome!
