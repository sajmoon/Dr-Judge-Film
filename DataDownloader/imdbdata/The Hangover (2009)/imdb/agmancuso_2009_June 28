Yes, okay, it&#x27;s very funny at times down right hilarious. What sets
this comedy apart from others of its ilk, is a well structured script
and a pace that doesn&#x27;t allow any form of thinking. The chemistry
between the four leads is also a plus. There is a surprising, maybe
unconscious, touch of innocence in the midst of this night of
debauchery that makes it palatable even charming. Bradley Cooper is
coming into his own and I&#x27;m absolutely certain that he was born to play
Emperor Caligula in a future Ridley Scott flick. The women, as in most
films about a bunch of heterosexuals doing childish things, are treated
appallingly. They are the enemy that they have to protect themselves
from or just escape, run, run as fast and as far as you can. Try to
find the hooker with a heart of gold, and if she looks like Heathter
Graham, that much better and forget about settling down. &#x22;The Hangover&#x22;
has already become the surprise hit of the summer 2009. I say, well
done, it could have been worse
