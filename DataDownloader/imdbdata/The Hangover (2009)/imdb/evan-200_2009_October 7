I didn&#x27;t have very high expectations just because these kind of
made-for-fraternity movies aren&#x27;t usually appealing to me. In that
regard it was what I expected. Not clever at all, there really weren&#x27;t
any jokes. I mean you pretty much know that the movie is going to be
about a terrible hangover, and it is - but there aren&#x27;t any very clever
jokes, solid characters, or interesting situations where something
funny might happen. Instead, the writers take the easy route (but not a
very funny one) and all of the attempted humor is just pure
shock-value. It just doesn&#x27;t meet my definition for what a good comedy
or good movie should be at all. I kept waiting to laugh, but never did.
I would not recommend this film to anyone. It&#x27;s all hype and marketing
and does not deliver.
