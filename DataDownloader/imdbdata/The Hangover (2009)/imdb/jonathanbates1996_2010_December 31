When I first heard about The Hangover I thought Wow this movie is going
to suck. Then I saw something that told me that The Hangover was a box
office smash and I suddenly decided to give the movie a try. Best
decision I have made on a movie in my life.<br /><br />It has the typical group of friends when there is a wedding. The crazy
one, Alan (Zach Galifianakis), The one that is going to tell you that
you are making the biggest mistake of your life, Phil (Bradley Cooper),
and the one who isn&#x27;t allowed to do anything because he is whipped, (Ed
Helms). What is so great about this film is it takes a normal thing (a
bachelor party) and gives it a twist (A &#x22;Hangover&#x22;).<br /><br />The acting is amazing, the script is amazing, and the plat is amazing
which adds up to be an amazing film.
