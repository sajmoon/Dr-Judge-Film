This movie is a crass attempt to cash in on the main Resident Evil
movie franchise.<br /><br />But if I&#x27;m going to slam this movie for one thing, it has got to be the
animation. It just sucked. For a 1998 film, OK, this would be
acceptable. But in 2008, this is just embarrassing and annoying. It&#x27;s
clear by the overall animation style, the filmmakers were going for
realism, rather than some other look, but they really missed the mark.<br /><br />The movements of the characters are wooden and puppet-like. The faces
are especially expressionless, most notable when they are supposed to
be screaming in panic, but look like they are ordering a latte at
Starbucks.<br /><br />In fact, the mouth movements are almost always out-of-sync with the
sound. It&#x27;s like watching an old, badly dubbed, kung fu movie, and it&#x27;s
just inexcusable.<br /><br />The storyline itself was fairly expected for a zombie film, and that&#x27;s
the only reason this film scores as high as a 5 from me. I reserve 5
and below for films that appear to be made intentionally to insult the
audience, and aren&#x27;t just badly made by accident.
