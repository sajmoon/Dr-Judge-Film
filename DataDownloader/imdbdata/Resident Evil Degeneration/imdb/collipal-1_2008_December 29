The studio Capcom may have been disappointed by the three Resident Evil
movies the production company Constantin Films made,so they now decided
to make their own version,but using digital animation and setting the
story in the same universe of the video-games,so we can consider
Resident Evil : Degeneration as a &quot;parallel&quot; movie to the other three
ones and not a continuation of Resident Evil : Extinction (by the
way,the only film of the trilogy I liked).The final result is that
Resident Evil : Degeneration is a very mediocre movie with various
fails and the most insipid animation I have seen from Final Fantasy :
The Spirits Within.I have never been a fan of the first Resident Evil
game.The main idea behind it was excellent : an interactive version of
the zombie films written and directed by George A. Romero,with a touch
of corporative conspiracies and huge monsters.But the weak controls and
the disastrous camera made me not to enjoy the video game,so I have not
played any of its sequels.So,I am not familiar with the mythology of
this saga.But,I found the story of Resident Evil : Degeneration
accessible...which does not mean I thought it was good.The story from
this movie is very poor and its &quot;mysteries&quot; and weak dramatic attempts
result so generic and predictable which did not produce any suspense or
interest on me.Another negative point from this movie is the animation
of the characters,because they completely lack of expression and
emotion,so they result totally bland.In other words,they are very rigid
and so,they cannot produce interest on the spectators.That important
fail had also appeared in the previously mentioned Final Fantasy : The
Spirits Within but that film is from almost 8 years ago.In all this
time,the technology has made a big evolution,so that explains that the
animators from Resident Evil : Degeneration did not put too much
interest to their work.As a result,this film is tremendously cold and
sterile.Resident Evil : Degeneration is better than Resident Evil and
Resident Evil : Apocalypse,but that&#39;s not saying too much,because I had
found that two films pathetic while this one is only bad by my point of
view.Resident Evil : Degeneration bored me pretty much and that&#39;s the
worst fail a movie can commit,so I do not recommend it.
