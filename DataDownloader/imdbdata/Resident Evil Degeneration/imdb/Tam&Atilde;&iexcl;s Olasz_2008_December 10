This comment is not meant to be offensive for anyone, so I apologize in
advance if it does.<br /><br />I could not watch the whole movie, stopped halfway through. The CG
itself wouldn&#39;t have been a problem, but the characters were. The
characters had no facial expression at all, and were very stiff. The
voice actors&#39; performance matched with the looks and motions of the
characters: empty, stiff and impassionate, it was like they were just
reading a script aloud. Sound effects were poor too in my opinion. Now
for the story: the 41-45 minutes I watched was boring, illogical
and(for me) frustrating.<br /><br />So, to summarize: awful character CG, awful voice acting, okay general
CG, poor sound effects, poor story.<br /><br />It may be more enjoyable for those who like know the Resident Evil
games/story.
