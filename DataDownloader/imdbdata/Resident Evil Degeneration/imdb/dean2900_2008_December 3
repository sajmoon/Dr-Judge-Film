I have never played the RE video games so this review is simply from a
perspective of whether or not it is entertaining.<br /><br />I have seen the first three Resident Live Action movies and found them
to be quite entertaining.<br /><br />However, I have to say that the Live Action movies were better than
this CGI Film. The CGI characters looked unnatural although some scenes
looked better than others. The plot really was not that interesting
about the T Virus and the terrorism.<br /><br />If you have not played the video game then I would advice you to stay
away from this. I did give it 4 stars because I was able to make it
through the whole movie but there is really nothing interesting. Also,
this is a very weak R Rating. There very little blood and gore in the
movie and no sexual situations or nudity. I think it should have been
PG-13 personally.<br /><br />Dean
