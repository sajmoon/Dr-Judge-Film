Dude, do you even know what you are talking about, i thought the
Resident evil: Degeneration movie was great!! Maybe not as good as
Final Fantasy 7: Advent Children but still it was an excellent movie
compared to the lame ass live action movies they made previously and
too they were OK except for the second one where Nemesis doesn&#39;t even
show his tentacles in the first place!??? I felt the CGI Graphics was
just great, sound was good, so was the plot, only little problem with
the lip syncing for the characters. I think most of you who hate this
movie or give it a low score because you must have expected too high
expectations from it and were unsatisfied expecting something out of
this world, I for one just saw this movie because I am a fan of all the
Resident evil games especially Resident evil 1, 2, 3 and 4(excellent
game) but not played 1 totally and just saw it as a great comeback and
as a normal viewer! Maybe everyone has their own opinion on this and i
respect that but as far as i see it, it was a great comeback at least
from a game converted into a movie!! Loved Resident Evil: Degeneration,
no doubt it and i hope they make a sequel in CGI!
