Zombies in an airport! The Resident Evil franchise gets a brand new
addition this winter with Resident Evil: Degeneration. It&#39;s the first
full CGI Resident Evil movie and it picks up seven years after the
destruction of Raccoon City by the US government after the first zombie
outbreak caused by the Umbrella Corporation. It&#39;s set in a US airport
where the T-Virus gets released once again and the airport is locked
down, giving the counter-zombie fighters four hours to solve the
problem before the virus is spread to the whole of the US.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of the video game series; I&#39;ve played &amp; completed
almost every Resident Evil game there is. Although not many people
didn&#39;t like the previous live action Resident Evil films starring Milla
Jovovich but I did. This is the second attempt and is the true Resident
Evil film because in a game you have movie clips which are CGI and it&#39;s
really hard to make a good live action film that is based on games.<br /><br />Alyson Court and Paul Mercier reprise their voice-work from the video
games as Claire Redfield &amp; Leon S Kennedy and Paul W.S Anderson isn&#39;t
involved this time although he did a good job with the previous live
action Resident Evil films.<br /><br />This was the most awaited movie for me of the year since I&#39;m a huge fan
and when I heard that it is a CGI movie, it was like a dream come true.
I managed to get a chance to see it and the movie is absolutely
brilliant, amazing, entertaining and exciting. After I seen it I just
couldn&#39;t resist myself from watching it again the next day and I seen
it with a different experience for the second time. Resident Evil:
Degeneration really gave you the true feeling of the game, like they
have a limited time to solve their puzzle. You just don&#39;t know what&#39;s
going to happen next and keeps you guessing and I really liked the look
of the zombies.<br /><br />The CGI is absolutely mind blowing, visually stunning and so life like.
The setting in an airport is different which as not has been referenced
in another Resident Evil game before so the fans won&#39;t get fed up, its
usually mansions, laboratories or police stations. Overall for me it&#39;s
a CGI movie turned classic and a must see especially if you are a fan.
