The live action travesties went from poor to worse. Anyone who loved
the story, characters and atmosphere of the original games was always
going to be disappointed with Anderson&#39;s cheesy action movie. But to
RE:D, it&#39;s not the most amazing thing in the world but it does rise to
the top as being one of the best films based on a Game Franchise (not
that it&#39;s hard). The story revolves around Leon Kennedy and Claire
Redfield, the two main characters from the 2nd Game. The movie is an
extension of the game universe not an adaption, it&#39;s a bridge between
Resident Evil 4 and 5. The story is interesting, typical style of anime
so a certain amount of western viewers probably won&#39;t like it&#39;s
structure. I say if you loved the games, checked out the books and
hated the live action movies this will be up your alley.
