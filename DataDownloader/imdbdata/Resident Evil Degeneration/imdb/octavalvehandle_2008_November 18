I just got back from the West Coast premiere of RESIDENT EVIL:
DEGENERATION. Overall it was fun but I&#39;m a big fan of the RESIDENT EVIL
video games. If you loves zombies or the games, it&#39;s a must. Otherwise,
you may want to skip it.<br /><br />It sort of reminded me of one long cut-scene from the games but I like
the RE cut-scenes, so that&#39;s a good thing. It also has a genuine
Japanese RE feel to it unlike those disappointing live-action movies.<br /><br />I was hoping the story would have more relevance to the events of the
games. Despite having Claire and Leon and a lot of other key elements,
this seemed like a standalone adventure. (But we&#39;ll have to wait for RE
5 to see for sure.) If anything, it&#39;s a bit like an RE2 sequel but I
would have preferred more appearance by the classic T-virus zombies.<br /><br />The computer animation and motion capture mix sometimes makes the
characters look like creepy mannequins. And the cheesy over dramatic
dialog coming of their plastic faces causes a lot of unintentional
laughs. When Leon Kennedy stands still, he looks like a photo printed
on a piece of cardboard. And his personality is equally cardboard. But
the RE games were never known for their acting. The 7 stars I&#39;m giving
this is for fans only. If you are not into the games, it may seem like
a 2 to you.<br /><br />(On DVD and Blu-Ray December 30, 2008)
