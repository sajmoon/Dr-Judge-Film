Resident evil degeneration.. i think it&#x27;s the best resident evil movie
out of all of them it is much more better than the three American crap
version because not only it&#x27;s following the games that the cap-com
makers created but they also made a really really good animation movie
of it, plus use the voices from the games (Claire red-field &#x26; Leon s
Kennedy) and in the movie it also put a couple of scene&#x27;s from the
resident evil 2 game (Leon &#x26; Claire trying to escape from the zombies,
the destruction of raccoon city, and when they showed you the tyrant,
what was created by the G-virus,) which was awesome ha ha. hopefully
they are going to make a sequel for this movie because at the end of
this movie (degenneration) you see the senator (ron Davis)unconscious
on his chair so most likely he got infected by the zombies... so I&#x27;m
praying the cap-com team are going to make another movie... it would
make me all excited.
