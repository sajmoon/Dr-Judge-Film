Alright, THIS IS NOT A FAN REVIEW (for the people complaining that the
score is caused by fan reviews) saw the movie and i have to say, i
agree with the fan guys, its really good. Keeps you glued to the screen
from start to finish with is action sequences and calm moments alike.
The plot is beautifully twisted and the CG is top-notch (although the
walking animation is a bit awkward at places). You&#39;ll see some old
friends and some new faces as well (Angela looks marvelous in the SRT
outfit :P). Compared to the films with Mila Jovovich i&#39;d say this
(though shorter) is definitely better - a bigger punch in a smaller
package.<br /><br />see this one if you already haven&#39;t, its definitely worth it. ill be
buying this when its out on DVD for sure.
