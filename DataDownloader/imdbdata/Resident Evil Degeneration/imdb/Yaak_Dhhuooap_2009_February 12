Perhaps you might read this thinking review: &#39;I quite fancy
Degeneration. After all, I liked the Milla Jovavich films.&#39; You might
be in for a disappointment.<br /><br />Much as I hate to acknowledge the Resident Evil critics (i.e. those who
have never placed themselves in the direct path of one of the games for
long enough for it to get it&#39;s hooks into you), there is some truth in
the fact that Degeneration doesn&#39;t stand on it&#39;s own as a film
particularly well. It skirts over too much, expects that the viewer
already has a certain level of knowledge and brazenly tosses out
cryptic references that only the fans will get.<br /><br />Make no mistake, though this contains all the ingredients of a film: a
story, a selection of set-pieces, a smattering of characters, this is<br /><br />basically an informative insert in the lineage of the Resident Evil
universe. It is a wedge between parts 4 and 5 that few who have not
played them will appreciate.<br /><br />The plot, such as it is, pertains to attempts by individuals to
profiteer and exploit the dubious legacy of the, now destroyed Umbrella
Corporation, punctuated by yet another unsuccessful attempt to use the
G-Virus. Sadly, much of this is barely explained or fleshed out,
serving only to introduce Umbrella&#39;s successor, Tricell ahead of their
involvement in the events of Resident Evil 5. Lamentably the same lack
of focus affects the characters and is particularly apparent in the
case of the tragic anti-hero Curtis Miller as well as Albert
Wesker-alike Frederic Downing.<br /><br />While I cannot deny that I would struggle to see anything at all that a
non RE fan would like about this film, to me, despite what I have just
said, it still has it&#39;s charm. The CG animation is absolutely
fantastic. As is the voice acting, despite one or two clunky RE moments
(Jill Sandwich anyone?) and while the score is restrained in comparison
to the games it contains the same portent piano motifs at suitable
junctures. But first and foremost the events leading up to this film
make it worth the bother in the first place. After all this where we
get to see what Leon is up to after the events of RE4. This is where we
get to see the reunion of Claire and Leon after the events of RE2 and
revel once again in that gloriously wooden sexual tension. Perhaps most
importantly of all, this is where the stage for RE5 is set.<br /><br />And that really is where all it&#39;s beauty and all it&#39;s merit lies.<br /><br />One for the fans? You bet.
