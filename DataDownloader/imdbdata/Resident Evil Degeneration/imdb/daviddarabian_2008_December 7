The animations was lousy and stiff, and the models looked like plastic
dolls from a third world factory. <br /><br />The lip-sync, rubbish, the textures on the models, don&#39;t even go
there...<br /><br />The story and dialogue...maaaaaan. It felt as if the movie was written
by a thirteen year old and the outcome was obvious and besides
terrible. <br /><br />One more thing though, why did they hire an American to talk in a
British accent when they easily just could have chosen a British actor
and at least got that part of the voice acting right.... <br /><br />Missed a great football match because of that and wasted 90 min approx
of my life.
