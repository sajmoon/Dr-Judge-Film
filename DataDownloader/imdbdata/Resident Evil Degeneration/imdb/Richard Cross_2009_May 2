This movie is awful beyond words... I can only surmise that those
rating it highly have been so exposed to the trashy cut sequences found
in Japanese video games, that they have simply come to accept terrible
voice acting, dialoge, plot, characterisation, etc. as par for the
course.<br /><br />Everything about this movie (apart from the visuals) is on the level of
cheap Saturday morning cartoons. I actually had to stop watching after
30 minutes, it was that bad. <br /><br />The dialogue is incredibly stilted and unrealistic. The accents are
some of the most unconvincing I&#x27;ve ever heard. There&#x27;s the American
trying to do an englishman, the woman trying to do a &#x22;little girl&#x22;
impression by making her voice whiny and nasal... all clich&#xE9;s of cheap,
talentless voice-over actors. Perhaps they ran out of money after
spending it all on the animation?<br /><br />What amuses me most about this film are the people who defend it...
people who say things like &#x22;this is for fans only&#x22; implying that anyone
who hasn&#x27;t played the Resident Evil video games is somehow unqualified
to give an opinion on this as a movie. Of course, the flipside to that
is that &#x22;the fans&#x22; will clearly buy into any old rubbish shovelled onto
their screens, so long as it ties in with whatever quasi-religious
clique they happen to belong to.<br /><br />Good luck to them... but any normal people shouldn&#x27;t waste their time
with this.
