While I would have to agree that this movie is a just a hair more true
to the video games, it comes off as a mix between the game and the live
action movies.<br /><br />It&#39;s basically a long cut scene from any given game. It&#39;s characters
are so wooden and stiff, the textures are pretty plain, the voice over
work is generally OK if the on screen characters could match the
emotion. And I know I&#39;m comparing apples to oranges here, but coming
out AFTER movies like FFVII:AC and other top notch computer animated
films, it really looks pretty bad.<br /><br />Also, and I&#39;m so amazed that I haven&#39;t seen this on any of the posts on
this page, but...Tyrant wasn&#39;t CGI...the shots of tyrant were
stop-motion animation...and it looks like a high school video class
project where someone took scenes from a game and mixed it in with
After Effects.<br /><br />I was excited to see it, and while generally pleased (Hey...it&#39;s a RE
movie, regardless of quality), i was let down by expecting it to be
more than it was.<br /><br />RE fans, see it. Zombie movie fans, see it. General public, don&#39;t.
