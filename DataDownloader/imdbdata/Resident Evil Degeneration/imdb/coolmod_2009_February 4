buy it now(its so Good i mean oh my god) RE fans will have already
bought it so they&#39;ll join me in the awesomeness but for you non RE
people watch it.<br /><br />Its good for a night in movie and you&#39;ll definitely want to watch it
again. Set piece&#39;s are at an all time high for this franchise. An
airport, a plane, an office block a collapsing building its quite well
stitched together and on that note the action is actually quite good
lots of blood which is to be expected from a franchise that built on
its level of violence and gore.<br /><br />but sadly most of these comments are let down slightly by the TERRIBLE
voice acting which harks back at the days of &quot;the master of unlocking&quot;
and &quot;Barry...where&#39;s Barry&quot; if your a fan of the games you&#39;ll no what
I&#39;m getting at. And in this generation of staggering visual effects and
life like CG characters seem to be running a a play station 2 engine
but they still get the job done and the story is quite well done if
slightly predictable to a fan of the series. but I&#39;m just nit picking
the simple fact is that these animated characters are more true to the
franchise than those &quot;hollywood&quot; movies. there is a real sense of
commitment that the team behind this wanted to make a movie fans could
be proud of as opposed to selling out their ideas for big bucks.<br /><br />Its 12.99 in HMV people and its worth it even if its just for the
resident evil 5 sneak peeks and excellent DVD extras.
