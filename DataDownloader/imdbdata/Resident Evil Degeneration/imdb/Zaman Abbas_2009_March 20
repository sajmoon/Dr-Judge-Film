well what more can i say? to start of with i just wanna say i have
always been a fan of resident evil.. the game franchise brought so much
excitement twist and successful plots into the mainstream gaming
experiences... however the resident evil trilogy movies that focus on
Jill valentine was complete different ... it was in my opinion a
disappointment .. those movies had absolutely nothing to do with the
resident evil games.. i don&#39;t know why they destroy the peoples
expectations.. then i came across resident evil degeneration which i
never heard of till now... initially i was reluctant to watch it
expecting another disaster....also the fact that it was a animation
also.. however i watched it and i was very surprised ... IT WAS MUCH
BETTER THAN ALL THE RESIDENT EVIL TRIOLOGYS PUT TOGETHER...! it was
well consistent... and was linked to the resident evil games
..including LEON &amp; Claire..... although it was more less the same story
as resident evil game franchises it still left the viewer satisfied
knowing that it was Resident evil after all a feeling the resident evil
movies didn&#39;t fulfill... anyhow this movie is for every one fans or
not.. it has excellent graphics almost real and very fun indeed... it
looks awesome I CONSTANTLY THOUGHT I WAS ACTUALLY PLAYING IT AS A
GAME... MY MIND WOULD AUTOMATICALLY LOOK FOR A CONTROL PAD.. THATS HOW
GREAT IT WAS.....after watching this it leaves viewer satisfied and if
ur like me u&#39;ll have the urge to play the games again just for fun....
10/10 too bad not many people know about this movie....
