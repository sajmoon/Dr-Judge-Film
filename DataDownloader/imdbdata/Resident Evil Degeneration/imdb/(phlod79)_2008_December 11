2008_December 11 
This film was clearly conceived almost entirely by people who watch too
many fan movies. Which would be fine except that they have stitched
together a truly horrific monster of a film from the bits and pieces
they found here and there. Almost every scene and every piece of
dialogue has been borrowed from somewhere else. A little bit of Aliens
here (&#39;the ship will destruct in five minutes&#39; anybody?) and a little
bit of every other cult action/horror/sci-fi film there gives us lines
such as: &quot;you&#39;re too pathetic to kill&quot; and &quot;If you don&#39;t try to save
one life, you&#39;ll never save any!&quot; well, duh...<br /><br />It is a very good-looking movie, which has clearly been painstakingly
made by true fans of the Resident Evil franchise. I just wish they&#39;d
spent as much time and effort on the plot and the script. Oh, and the
characters&#39; names. &quot;I&#39;m Leon S. Kennedy&quot; sounds heroic and American
because, people, it sounds like John F. Kennedy. Although I&#39;m pretty
sure that the former US president would never have introduced himself
using the middle initial, it just sounds ridiculous. Handsome guy,
awful character, very much like the film.
