I heard nothing but rave reviews for this movie.  One of my best friends
stared at me incredulously when he heard that I had never seen &quot;The Boondock
Saints.&quot;  Apparently, it's reached cult status.  Well, with all the hype
surrounding the movie, I reserved it on Netflix.com and I couldn't wait to
receive it in the mail.  Last night, I watched it with a friend.  Ten
minutes into the movie, I was so disappointed I wanted to turn it off. But I
held in there for the full duration of the movie just so I could write a
review about it today.<br /><br />Well, here's the premise: two Irish Catholic brothers in South Boston, on an
apparent mission from GOD, start killing members of a Russian mafia.  Willem
Dafoe, a clever FBI agent, is sent in to investigate but ends up admiring
the brothers.  Written and directed by any other person, this story would
have been incredible.  Instead, in the hands of Troy Duffy, the story was
reduced to the level of a made-for-TV movie.  All the stars in the film
overracted.  Yes, unfortunately, even Willem Dafoe.  The most blatant
overacting, however, was done by Rocco, the &quot;funny man&quot; mobster.  He wasn't
very funny, though he told one racist joke that drew a chuckle out of me. <br /><br />Besides the overacting, there were horrible cliches I couldn't stomach.  For
example, Willem Dafoe is a gay FBI agent.  This was milked for laughs
several times during the movie.  At one point, he calls his lover a &quot;fag&quot;
and the bartender at a gay bar a &quot;fairy&quot;.  Why this was included in the
movie is beyond me, especially the scene in the gay bar.  It just didn't
fit, but I guess the director found all of this comedic.  Another cliche was
the old Irish bartender with Tourette's Syndrome.  In the beginning of the
movie, he curses infront of nuns in a hospital.  Yeah, I know, could it get
any worst?  <br /><br />I could not stomach this movie.  The comedy was less than mediocre, the
story was underdeveloped, the acting was terrible, and the cliches gave me a
headache.  I cannot understand the appeal of a movie like this.  Very poor
work by Troy Duffy.
