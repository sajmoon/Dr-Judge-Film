This movie should come with a warning that it will absorb more than 70
hours of your life. Here&#x27;s how that time expenditure breaks down:<br /><br />* 2 hours to watch the movie (or 3 hours if you&#x27;ve had to pause it
several times to resettle yourself, grit your teeth and carry on) <br /><br />* 2 hours to prepare and soak in a long, hot bath to remove the soiled
feeling that you&#x27;ve been &#x27;had&#x27; by the director, the producers and the
&#x27;friends&#x27; who recommended it and said it was &#x27;great&#x27;. <br /><br />* 6 hours to read the reviews on IMDb and elsewhere, to see if others
in the world agree with your feeling that this was a terrible
experience. <br /><br />* 60 hours of therapy because you&#x27;re finding that you keep replaying
some of the worst scenes over and over in your mind at the most
inconvenient times. The distraction is constant and you can&#x27;t work,
sleep or make love to your spouse.<br /><br />In desperation you seek out a therapist to find answers to the
questions that plague you: How did this film get made? Who sanctioned
it? Has Willem Dafoe experienced any subsequent embarrassment? Who
designed his suit? Have I seen any other movies this bad? Does the
writer/director really believe my IQ is sub-92? Who makes that kind of
orangey fake blood, and why do they still use it when it looks so
false? Have I seen acting this poor since our high school production of
Grease? Has any previous movie stolen so widely, so indiscriminately,
so artlessly and so cynically from forerunners upon whose success it&#x27;s
hoping to hitch a free ride? Why don&#x27;t directors tell the actors to
stop moving their eyes after they&#x27;ve been killed? Is it really true
that all evil people in the world are bald, tall and weigh 300 pounds?
Has Billy Connolly ever been worse than this? OK, accepting that he has
- because even Connolly&#x27;s huge ego must remember his string of dire
performances in such things as Timeline, Beverly Hills Ninja and The
Man Who Sued God - will he now go back to supplementing the Connolly
millions only through stand-up comedy, which he does exceptionally
well, and give a real actor a chance to make a few shillings in the
acting world? Or is Connolly committed to raking in the shekels no
matter how dishonestly earned?<br /><br />I could spend time critiquing this film&#x27;s dubious and infantile
morality, the hokum posited as philosophy, the poor writing, the
self-indulgent, careless and flabby directing, the &#x27;by-the-numbers&#x27;
acting, the terrible Irish accents (&#x27;to be sure, to be sure ... ah
begorrah!&#x27;) and the immature plot, but I won&#x27;t because it&#x27;s already
been done in numerous other reviews on this site. This film is poor.
Very poor. To get sucked in and carried along by this storyline you
don&#x27;t so much need a suspension of disbelief as a full lobotomy, and
the Director is shameless about reminding you of that every few minutes
because he really is an arrogant man who genuinely believes you&#x27;re far
too dumb to notice.<br /><br />In conclusion, here&#x27;s the main question: How exercised about a film do
you need to be to go and write a review about it? For most people, I
think the answer is &#x27;pretty gol&#x27;darned exercised&#x27;. For the majority of
us with bars to visit, drinks to drink, lives to live and no interest
in the hobby of review writing, we either need to really love, or
really hate, a movie before we can be motivated to share that love or
vent that spleen.<br /><br />This movie has 800+ reviews on IMDb alone. To put that in context,
major movies like Godfather II with 500+ reviews, The Good the Bad and
the Ugly (540+), One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest (500+), Star Wars:
Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (680+) and Goodfellas (750+) are
all lagging waaaay behind this gem!! <br /><br />I believe that you, as a potential viewer, need to ask yourself why
that is. And when you go on to check those reviews you&#x27;ll notice with a
start that a lot of them exist purely because their writers needed to
vent their spleen. Look at mine ... I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but
felt I had to do something cathartic to try and rid myself of the
noxious residue left by this pestilential offering.<br /><br />And now I feel cleansed. It worked! The therapist was right.
