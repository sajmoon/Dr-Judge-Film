When I heard of this film, my friends said I should go see it. I did
not know what to expect from it at all. After I saw it, I was so
satisfied with the result. I really liked the storyline to it. Two
vigilante brothers who believe they are on a mission from god to hunt
down and execute people who are evil and corrupt. I especially liked
Willem Dafoes performance as the FBI agent is sent to bring them in,
but he does not know whether to arrest them or join them. This film had
some really good humour, great acting, the storyline was easy to follow
and it was very well paced. If you liked films like the punisher for
example, you will definitely like this movie. Hands off to the guy who
directed it.
