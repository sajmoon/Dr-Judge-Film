I can&#39;t believe people actually take this movie seriously. This has got
to be one of the out and out dumbest films I&#39;ve ever seen, if not ever
made. Willem Dafoe prancing about to classical music, unbelievably
stupid gunfights, horrible dialogue, Willem Dafoe cross-dressing. This
is really a heap of garbage. And I love bad movies. In fact I like
watching you&#39;re average B-movie trash more than the boring mainstream
crap put out by the big studios. But, this movie is incredibly bad. If
it was regarded as a &quot;so bad its good&quot; movie, I would praise it up and
down. But, to watch it in the context of your friends telling you that
it is a legitimate good film makes it one of the worst pieces of junk
ever. I seriously can&#39;t believe that many of my own friends, who
otherwise have good taste, consider this a good film. This is crap, and
that&#39;s all it is.
