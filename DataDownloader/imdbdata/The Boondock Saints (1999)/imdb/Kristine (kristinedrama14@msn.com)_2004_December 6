Man, I cannot believe how awesome this movie was. I'm still in the
aftermath of it. I can't stop thinking about it. My friend in my
communication class had used the movie as a speech, and she showed the
court scene. I was confused, but it seemed like a great movie. I had to
see it. So, I went on a little trip to Blockbuster Video, and found it
in the &quot;Employee's Favorites&quot; section. I must see this movie, I just
had too. Well, I went home, put it on my dresser and waited 'till last
minute to watch it. 2 hours before it was due back. I watched it and I
was upset, I wanted to see it again. So, I went to Best Buy, and God
bless them, it was $9.99. I showed it to my sister and mom and they
fell in love with it as well.<br /><br />The reason I loved this movie so much, I think is because it brings up
so many good issues. And Sean Patrick Flannery is so hot. &quot;Boondock
Saints&quot; for some reason is somewhat justified in the deaths of these
mobsters. And Sean Patrick Flannery is so hot. The story is very
original and awesome. And Sean Patrick Flannery is so hot. Just watch
the movie. Did I mention how hot Sean Patrick Flannery is?<br /><br />10/10
