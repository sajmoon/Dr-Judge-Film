I&#39;ve been a fan of Defoe and Connolly for some time, so I was looking
forward to seeing this and was grossly disappointed. The plot is
ridiculously improbable as are most of the characters. I kept hoping it
would get better, then it mercifully ended. There are so many errors in
the film it becomes more comical than the comedy that&#39;s supposed to be
there. Some people are comparing this to works from Ritchie or
Tarantino. Sorry, I can&#39;t see it. Both those directors have a style
that&#39;s entertaining and grabs your attention. This film misses by a
wide margin. There&#39;s no style, no originality and the violence becomes
boring. Mind you, it gave the squib guys plenty of work.
