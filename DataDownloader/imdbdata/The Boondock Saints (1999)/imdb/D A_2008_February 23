A rather unintentionally comical revenge-fantasy of sorts will only
impress younger males with a loopy corruption-fighting plot achieving
far less then V for Vendetta&#39;s occasional riles.<br /><br />Troy Duffy obviously took a pop crash course in Tarantino 101, but like
so many other second-rate castoff filmmakers, only manages to exploit
hip looking gun-play in the kind of way that goes good with mediocre
techno.<br /><br />Here the only anchor to a naive show-off&#39;s indulgences of poor and/or
lifeless (terrible leads) actors reading from a bad script are Duffy&#39;s
undeniable creativity when actually executing some of the action
sequences, and the surprising commitment he got out of Willem Dafoe.<br /><br />For the teenage cult hit it has become, the blacklisted writer-director
proves himself a promising flash of at least a certain type of talent,
simply not the type that transcends past age 22.
