2004_May 5 

I had this movie reccomended to me and was encouraged by reading the reviews
on this website, but oh what a disappointment.
The cast seemed to be in competition with each other to see who could shout
and scream the loudest, the clarity of the dialogue deemed superfluous, and
the credibility of the plot non existent from the outset when one of the
brothers rips out a toilet cistern and jumps from several storeys up taking
out one bad guy himself and the other with the cistern. Eh yea
right.
Billy Connolly's Irish accent was as convincing as Groundskeeper Willie's
Scottish one. His shoot out scene with his adversaries (soon to be comrades)
displayed ineptitude of aim not seen since several thousand Germans all
missed John Wayne over a period of 10 minutes at a range of 10 yards whilst
armed with sub machine guns.
This film is certainly original in many ways, I wish that its originality
overcame its down side but I'm afraid not.<br /><br />Alan
