Damn, this is really the most shameless Quentin Tarantino ripoff ever.
Every action-scene reminds me of something in Pulp Fiction, but only a
lot more crappy. The acting is dull and uninspired, and a lot of the
lines of the actors sound like they are reading cue-cards or something.
What I also thought, is that a lot of the action seemed out of place
sometimes and even kinda random. I don&#39;t know why, but this movie just
tries too hard to be ultra-violent I think. Willem Dafoe does a
miserable job of trying to portray a detective that desperately needs
some vacation. Some scenes with him are just plain ridiculous, and
thats a shame because I know Willem Dafoe is a good actor and I enjoy a
great deal of other movies he has played in.<br /><br />The plot (if there even is a plot) is also a big problem. Its just so
damn random. The only thing this movie is about are 2 Christian
brothers who are out to kill every &#39;evil&#39; person in the name of god.
Thats it. Other then just being a ridiculous concept, its just
unrealistic in every way. Maybe some die-hard christians will love it,
but even they have to admit how utterly uninspired the plot is. I&#39;m not
going to spoil any of it, but I can tell you that the film doesn&#39;t have
any type of development in the story what so ever. The whole movie just
seems to be random a lot of times. The 2 brothers find somebody who is
&#39;evil&#39; in their perspective, they kill him, and detective Paul Smecker
(Willem Dafoe) tries to solve who the murderer&#39;s are. Paul Smecker also
does a shitty job as a detective seeing how much of a mess the 2
brothers are leaving.<br /><br />The Boondock Saints is a popular title nowadays and I can definitely
see why it got so many hype, but the truth is that it really isn&#39;t all
that special and the content that is worth watching I can bet that a
lot of people have seen already in either a Quentin Tarantino movie or
in some other movie. There is nothing wrong with mindless
action-movies, but every movie needs some kind of spine, and this movie
unfortunately doesn&#39;t have that.
