The Boondock Saints is an entertaining and yet incredibly flawed movie.
The two main characters are the McManus brothers. From the start we
don&#x27;t know much about them. We know that they&#x27;re Irish, they like to
drink, they like to fight and they work in a meat plant. Oh wait, they
also speak five languages ...and yet they work in a meat plant. St.
Patty&#x27;s Day gets off to a rough start when the two of them get in a
fight with a big, man-hating lesbian at their job. What do we know
about this woman? Well, she&#x27;s big, she hates men and she&#x27;s a lesbian.
But the trouble really starts for the brothers when three big, angry
Russian gangsters walk into their bar. We don&#x27;t know much about these
guys either. We know that they&#x27;re big, they&#x27;re angry, they&#x27;re Russian
and they&#x27;re gangsters. A fight ensues where one of the big Russians
gets tied to a bar and his ass lit on fire. The next day, the McManus
brothers seem quite surprised when the Russians break into their loft
seeking revenge. After all, it was only a bar fight. To cut to the
chase, the brothers receive a message from God and they determine that
it is their divine mission to become vigilante gangster killers. They
are delighted when they gain access to a small arsenal of guns. We
don&#x27;t know if they have a history of handling guns, but hey, they&#x27;re
Irish and they like to fight, so why wouldn&#x27;t they like guns? As well
as going after Russian gangsters, they go after Italian gangsters led
by a powerful crime boss. What do we know about this guy? Well, we know
that he&#x27;s Italian, he likes salami sandwiches and he&#x27;s a crime boss. <br /><br />We do have the pleasure of meeting at least one complex character in
this movie. Willem Dafoe plays a closeted gay FBI agent who is a genius
investigator. Unfortunately, he really can&#x27;t save this movie. One of
the biggest problems with Saints is not what we see, but what we DON&#x27;T
see. The brothers talk about the lack of justice in the world and the
victimization of innocent people. So naturally, they go after guys who
have victimized innocent people, right? Well... actually we don&#x27;t
really know if they&#x27;ve hurt innocent people. I mean, the guys they kill
are gangsters so we can assume they&#x27;ve hurt people, but we never see
them do that. As a result, the act of killing these men feels like a
hollow achievement. Perhaps we should despise these evil men, but we
don&#x27;t. How can we despise men who we know NOTHING about? We&#x27;re
introduced to a particular group of men about to be killed by our
heroes. The men are sitting and talking in a hotel room. What have they
done to deserve death? Umm... they&#x27;re sitting and talking in a hotel
room. Our heroes go to a porn show where a few gangsters watch a
stripper. What have they done to deserve death? Umm... they&#x27;re watching
a stripper. <br /><br />But the really big problem I have with this movie is one that
admittedly doesn&#x27;t say anything about the quality of the film. This
movie is set in Boston. So where is the Irish mob??? If these brothers
are so righteous in their pursuit of justice, why only go after the
Italians and Russians? A more interesting movie would have involved the
brothers being recruited by Irish mobsters only for the two of them to
turn on them, as well as kill the local Russians and Italians. Then as
a result of their killing spree, three rival gangs share a common goal
of catching and killing two vigilantes. Saints is not without its
moments and writer/director Troy Duffy is capable of writing some good
scenes. But creatively, he gets away with murder.
