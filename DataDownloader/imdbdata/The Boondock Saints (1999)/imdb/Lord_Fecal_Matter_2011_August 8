This movie was, very clearly, an allegory of the struggle
Irish-Americans faced when immigrating from Scotland in the 1700&#x27;s. The
white man&#x27;s oppression of them is portrayed as heroism in this film,
and the Irish have been depicted as little more than brainless,
gun-toting, thugs. Steven Spielberg probably has never even come close
to dealing with actual subjects like oppression, segregation, and
genocide, so the fact that his people&#x27;d put his name on this movie does
not come as a surprise. I normally only watch independent,
thought-provoking movies, but I thought that, just this once, I would
descend to the lower ranks of film film appreciation because I thought
the title of the film was very Kafka-esque. I was wrong, the movie
ended up being just another Hollywood hate-film packaged as
independent, art-house, genius.
