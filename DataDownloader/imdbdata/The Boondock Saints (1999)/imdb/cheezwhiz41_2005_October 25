When i rented this movie, I had high hopes. I heard from many people
what a good movie this was. Boy, were they wrong.<br /><br />Acting and directing were terrible, especially an over the top Willem
Dafoe. The overall narrative was choppy, relying on flashbacks to tell
the story. Dafoe's recreations of the crimes was inconsistent in both
intensity and composition (ie the way shots were put together).<br /><br />After i saw &quot;Poolhall Junkies&quot;, i realized that the two movies were
similar in quality of production value, but somehow &quot;Poolhall&quot; managed
to keep my attention.<br /><br />Don't rent &quot;Boondock Saints&quot;. Rent something else.
