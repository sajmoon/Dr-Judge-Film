I hate whenever I read on whatever comments titles like (I Hated it),
(I Loved It), (This is Not Good), (This Is The Greatest Movie Ever),
BLA BLA BLA !!. Those frank simple declarations or that kind of natural
impression used to make me sick, because I&#39;ve always thought that you
must be the perfect accurate analyzer when you&#39;re talking about a
movie, it deserves that. But you know what ?! I have had it.. and let
me scream : this one doesn&#39;t deserve it at all !!<br /><br />WaW it&#39;s great to be alive and say the words which you really want to
say. I will not be that objective diplomatic cool person anymore. I
will declare it to the whole universe.. IT SUCKS ! <br /><br />I&#39;m a scriptwriter myself, and how I just suffer to find a director or
a producer whom wants to make my little foolish work. And now I watch
this trash which is unbelievably the rock-bottom, the lowest known
level of foolishness and they DID it !! That would make me so angry for
sure ! I think it happened like this : there was one idiot writer
director who convinced some idiot producers to make such a CRAP ! Well,
it&#39;s the story of every day, but in this stupid situation it didn&#39;t
make my day ! <br /><br />It&#39;s a wicked formula, a bad recipe, a silly song they played the way a
crazy D.G might play : a lot of pure violent killing scenes, some kind
of unlikeness in putting it (by flash backs !?), some strong premise in
the end to make everything look good for that thickhead critics !<br /><br />However now I&#39;m no one but a very poor viewer who watched that and
HATED it so much. I didn&#39;t (as a viewer) find anything to love or to
enjoy (Willem Dafoe as a whore !?.. Oh God.. That was so horrible !). I
didn&#39;t (as a writer) find anything to be happy about !. And finally I
didn&#39;t (as an unspoken critic) find that decent thing to talk about in
here (the war of the minority&#39;s gangs, the achievement of the lost
equity as a mission from God, the media&#39;s mania over those saint
killers who never kill an innocent human ???) Get out of here !.. Give
me a break !.. Are you kidding me ?!! <br /><br />Just imagine how funny this movie would be if any censorship wants to
delete the (F) ward or the (S) word out of it ! That would help it to
be a lot funnier (BEEP BEEP all the time !). Or let the Chinese people
take the movie and play with it like (Steve Oedekerk) did with (Hu hao
shuang xing - 1977) in his movie (Kung Pow: Enter the Fist - 2002) to
make a Chinese comic copy of (The Boondock Saints) that should make it
better, a real useful thing! <br /><br />I get sick with putting an Opera singing or music in the background of
the killing scenes in any cheap movie now to project a sense of
holiness or as an epitaph for human civilization, or to imitate
(Stanley Kubrick) in (A Clockwork Orange - 1971) or anything ! <br /><br />Finally if this movie wants by his very weak ending to make a satire
for the American system which creates such a bloody phenomenon or the
media which glorifies it in unintentional way, then (by its very own
logic) this movie is one of those ceremonials of those killers or a
crime in itself especially with this long free show of executions and
corpses is on without a solid meaning, without a serious study for such
disturbed men or society. It&#39;s a silly rough video game which tried to
be a diligent satire and turned out to be a foolish video game and a
fabricated satire ! So it&#39;s not that meaningless movie, it&#39;s a
meaningless movie which alleges that it actually has a meaning, and
that&#39;s the worst kind ! <br /><br />I&#39;m sad to say it.. but I&#39;ll say it : I&#39;ve seen uglier. but this is
even the ugliest !
