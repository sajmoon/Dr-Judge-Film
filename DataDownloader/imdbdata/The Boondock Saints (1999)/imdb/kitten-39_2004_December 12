This film starts with a badly acted &amp; scripted opening credits (which
also have no significance to the movie) and then just gets worse and
worse. How so many people can give it good reviews I just don't know.
It tries to be funny, but none of the jokes are worth even a snigger,
they are just crude and childish. All the comparisons to Pulp Fiction
are because both films are violent and bloody; however unlike Pulp
Fiction the violence here is unsubtle, unnecessary and handled
amateurly. Indeed the whole film, from script, to acting, direction,
lighting and editing is amateurish (and not in a good way at all). I
don't care if it's the directors' first film &amp; they had a tight budget,
you can make a good film with a video-phone and match-stick men puppets
if you at least have a good script. This sure didn't have a good
script. The only thing consistent in this film is how bad it is all
through. Actually i'm not sure about that because I could only manage
to watch about half of it (and even that much was a real struggle).
I've never posted on IMDb (in about 8 years of using it) before but
after reading all the praise for this movie felt I had to register and
post in the hope I'll save somebody else from wasting time on this
drivel. I see (and am frankly amazed) that they are making a sequel, I
think it'll be one of the first times a sequel is better than the
original movie because I really don't think they could make it any
worse.
