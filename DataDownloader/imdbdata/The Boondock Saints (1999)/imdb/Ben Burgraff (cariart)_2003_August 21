The Boondock Saints is one of the most pleasant surprises I've had in my
years of watching indies, and it proves conclusively that you don't need a
massive budget to do a terrific action film!<br /><br />Two blue-collar Boston Irish brothers (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman
Reedus, who are both terrific!) rid their favorite pub of an influx of
Russian gangsters, and soon decide they are on a Mission from God to execute
all the 'heavy hitter' criminals from the city. While this makes them local
heroes, it also sets sympathetic detective Willem Dafoe on their
trail.<br /><br />The story is reminiscent of the 'Death Wish' series, without the glossy
superficiality of the Bronson films. At times funny, at times disturbing, it
never loses momentum, with a twist ending is both satisfying and thoroughly
insane! <br /><br />While the violence is graphic, the story is character-driven, and never
allows the executions to overwhelm the plot. You actually like the brothers,
and may be hard-pressed NOT to root for them, even if you do feel a bit
guilty about it!<br /><br />The Boondock Saints is a fabulous film, one that deserves your
attention!
