Just threw everything in there that Duffy thought was &quot;cool&quot; and made a
F*CKING MESS!! THANK GOODNESS IT/HE FAILED!! THERE IS A GOD!! it would
have been a decent story had he not &quot;cool&quot;ed the F*ck out of it. Just
because your friends think it&#39;s cool doesn&#39;t make it cool. If you,
Duffy, are reading this, please take this to heart, your writing stinks
and your direction, if it can be called that, SUCKS! Please , fella, go
back to hanging out at the pub with your homeys, because this isn&#39;t
working out for anyone. Also, to anyone considering hiring this HACK,
please rent the doc about this clown, Duffy. He might be suitable for a
shoeshine position, but filmmaker?, NO!! Sorry, buddy, but I had to get
that out. Had hope until I saw the piece of garbage known as &quot;Boondock
Saints&quot;, NOTHING COOL ABOUT THIS MOVIE, IT IS A JOKE!!!
