I GIVE A LOT OF THE MOVIE AWAY IN THIS COMMENTARY, SO IF YOU THINK
SOMEHOW I
WILL RUIN THIS FILM FOR YOU, DON'T READ AND LET THE MEN WHO MADE THIS
FILM
RUIN IT FOR YOU.<br /><br />What the heck is wrong with you people? &quot;You people&quot; referring to anyone
who
doesn't hate this film. I watched it because I am a Willem Dafoe fan, but
honest to God, I'm not anymore because of I did. I have never wanted
EVERY
character in a movie to die before until I saw this film. The scenes are
incredibly fake and so overdone, Willem's character is HORRIBLE, the 2
main
characters are HORRIBLE, their American friend with the beard....let me
put
it this way; if i ever see this guy on the street i promise you I will
hit
him right in the face and love every second of it. Then i will beg him to
give me Troy Duffy's address so i can go over there and beat the crap out
of
him as well. I'm not saying that I am a genius or know everything about
movies, but if you gave me any amount of time i could make a better film
than this. I have NEVER literally, i promise, been physically ill after
viewing a film until i saw this terrible piece of crap. THIS IS THE WORST
MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!! I'm not exaggerating either. There was not one
good, quality scene in the whole film. Awful.<br /><br />Top Ten Out of the Uncountable Problems with this movie (random
order)
10. horrible characters...all of them<br /><br />9. horrible plot...every aspect of it is pure crap<br /><br />8. Willem is a GAY FBI AGENT who get his nipples kissed by an Asian guy
while talking on the phone about the case, then when the guy says &quot;I just
wanted to cuddle&quot; Willem says, &quot;cuddle? what a fag.&quot; I thought it couldnt
get worse, oh how wrong i was.<br /><br />7. A supposed professional hit man with 6 guns does not just tag a finger
off of one of the 3 stationary guys he's shooting at after firing 60+
rounds
at them.<br /><br />6. 3 stationary guys who not only kill people day in and day out will not
miss an old fat guy when all three of them are shooting at him. Even with
ONLY one finger, you should still be able to shoot this
guy.<br /><br />5. The whole air vent scene....what the heck....they are about to kill
the 9
most powerful criminals in the city by coming out the air vent when they
decide to start having a natural sibling rivalry scuffle with each other
and
they fall through the ceiling prematurely, but it's ok because the
magically
unattached rope clings onto something strong enough to hold both their
weight as they hang upside down and shoot all 9 men...<br /><br />4. It's impossible to a) uproot a toilet when u've been beaten up and
handcuffed to it, b) know where they are taking your brother to kill him
c)
make the decision to walk up the stairs to the roof d) throw the toilet
you
are hand-cuffed to off the roof directly onto the gunman and then jump
off
the 10-story roof onto the other guy e) live through it<br /><br />3. The whole dead hooker/stripper scene...the annoying American guy grabs
a
dead hooker's breast and later in the film, after his friends get mad at
him
for doing it, says &quot;i gotta make up for that tit thing.&quot; and I'm supposed
to
feel sad when this guy dies?<br /><br />2. They take over their own court hearing and kill the witness and recite
their little sayings and make it all &quot;holy&quot; to off yet another &quot;evil&quot;
person...I'm almost in tears at this point in the film.<br /><br />1. Willem...He dresses up like a woman, walks right up to a bad guy's
mansion door, knocks, gets invited in for sex, is face to face with a bad
guy's unzipped fly, then doesn't go through with it b/c his wig
accidentally
falls off...if thats not bad enough, the whole movie he's trying to catch
these guys and when he finally does, he decides he agrees with their
cause??? WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND HUGE PIECE OF CRAP. HOW ON EARTH DID
THIS
MOVIE GET A 7.7 RATING????
