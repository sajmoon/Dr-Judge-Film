It's fitting that aging porn star Ron Jeremy has a bit part in this.
Only in America could people having sex get an X rating while this
Snuff Porn can be shown in every kiddie mall multiplex in the nation
with a mere R. If you think that playing Grand Theft Auto while Grandma
visits on Mother's Day is entertaining, you'll certainly consider this
wonderful fun. If you have a shred of humanity left in you, you won't.
(A neighbor loaned me the DVD with lavish praise, and reminded me why
I've never been over to her apartment. But I was so impressed and
appalled, I registered with IMDb just to post this glowing tribute!) <br /><br />Subtract the ingeniously varied F word bleating from the mouths of the
salon coiffed pretty boy cast, shoving their fully erect pistols into
various faces, and blowing brains against walls, over and over and over
again, and you essentially have a silent movie of a high speed
slaughterhouse with MTV soundtrack.<br /><br />To understand the &quot;story&quot; of this film, you simply take the &quot;logic&quot; of
the National Rifle Association, multiply by the number of executions of
Gov. Bush's last year in Texas, and divide by the average IQ of a 13
year old puppy killer. But to be fair, the &quot;story&quot; is not really any
more important than in any other porn film. Duh! It's about the
killing, dude! Or even better, domination and killing. Or best of all,
kick ass rockin' and domination and killing.<br /><br />Check it out. Or save yourself further damage. Depending on whether
you're still human or not.
