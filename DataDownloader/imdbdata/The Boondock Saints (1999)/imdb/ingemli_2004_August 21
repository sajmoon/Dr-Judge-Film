This movie would be rubbish without Willem Dafoe. The plot in itself is
utter crap. A couple of Christian fundamentalists, so called saints,
kill in the name of god to make the world a better place. They continue
doing this for the entire movie, terminating to a poor end which opens
up for the sequel. The movie without Dafoe is hardly a 2/10. Dafoe does
a really excellent job in this movie, proving the immense character
capability he has, providing both action and emotion. He carries the
story alone as the chief detective from FBI. His lines are excellent
and so is his acting. I have never seen him perform better than in this
movie. Without him, it would be a b-class movie not worthy of being
produced.
