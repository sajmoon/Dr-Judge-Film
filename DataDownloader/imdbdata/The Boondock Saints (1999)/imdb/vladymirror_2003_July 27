I don't understand. This movie has higher rating than say &quot;The Bourne
Identity&quot;, &quot;Face off&quot;, &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; if you like &quot;Natural Born
Killers&quot; (those are not necessarily my favorites). I really don't get it;
it's beyond my comprehension. What's wrong with you people? This movie SUCKS
big time. End of story. I mean I've seen worse but none of them had such a
high rating. I even read something about &quot;The Boondock Saints&quot; (TBS) being a
cut movie. What the hell is going on here?<br /><br />Let me say it again: this movie BLOWS completely. I'm not going to elaborate
over the flaws and holes in the plot which is actually an abyss of nonsense
for it would be an insult to my intelligence. And Willem Dafoe, what is he
doing in this movie in this ridiculous role. I&#129;fll say it again: I've seen
worse, much worse but we are talking 7.7 rating, classics, cult, a
masterpiece, and there is a sequel coming ... OK enough. <br /><br />We all need to see sometimes movies like &quot;Commando&quot;,  &quot;Predator&quot;, &quot;Rambo&quot;,
&quot;Total Recall&quot; which all have lower ratings but without the fuss. Even &quot;TBS&quot;
should have its audience, call it market niche, unfortunately bigger than I
expected. Hell, even &quot;Cobra&quot; with Stallone was more entertaining. This movie
is on par with &quot;Rambo 2&amp;3&quot;, &quot;Predator 2&quot;, &quot;Jason X&quot;. 5 stars out of
