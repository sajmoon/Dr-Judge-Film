<br /><br />I can't believe the number of positive comments on this tripe. A 7.6? Come
on folks, it's up to us to raise the bar for movies so derivitave junk like
this falls by the wayside and never leaves the hard drives of the fifteen
year old fanboys that conceive it. If you thought this was AWESOME!!!! or A
MASTERPIECE!!!! or ROCKED!!!!! or RULED!!! then check out these guys:
Besson, Scorsese, Tarantino, Woo, Richie. Director Troy Duffy has. In a
crowded bar. With the sound off.<br /><br />First of, um, who are the Saints anyway? Just a couple of tools in peacoats
who happen to have access to more firepower than the Wild Bunch and quote
Bible verses for no reason while wacking the most inept bunch of gangsters
since John Landis' epic peek into the criminal mind, Oscar? Are we supposed
to buy that Billy Connley is the &quot;cleaner&quot; (ugh) to end all &quot;cleaners&quot;
(ugh*2)? So... he's Hannibal Lecter crossed with Leon with a splash of
Manson and he still stands in the middle of the street with no cover trying
to shoot 3 guys? Rocco has to weigh in somewhere in the top 10 most
irritatingly unfunny comic relief sidekicks of all time who grabs a tit
(grade schoolers rejoyce, there's a tit in this movie!) and apologizes,
tells one of the most painfully unfunny jokes of all for what seems like 20
minutes to Ron Jeremy (the HI-LARITY of it all) and dies (finally) after
using the F-word (get a thesarus, a-hole) 200 times in one scene? And poor,
poor Willem Dafoe. From Jesus Christ, Max Schreck, to a homophobic gay
dectective who must wears drag in a ruse that Mr. Magoo would have trouble
not figuring out.<br /><br />The pace of this film is leaden as molasses. The tone is of revelation;
look
how cool all this is! Look how smart and hip I am! scenes seem to proclaim.
Come on, didn't someone tap this clown on the shoulder and tell him the
post-Tarantino hip-gangster sthick was trite 6 years ago?<br /><br />QT gave us his words, Woo gave us his melodrama, Rodriguez gave us his
exuberence, Scorsese his images, Besson his sense of cool. What does Duffy
give us?<br /><br />Well, there's a scene where a guy picks up a toilet and drops it on another
guy's head. I guess that's something.<br /><br />CS<br /><br />
