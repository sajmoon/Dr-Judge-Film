Wretched mobster drama set in modern-day Boston has Irish-Catholic twin
brothers (meat-packers who are fluent in just about every language!)
practically applauded by the police and the media for taking out a
couple of Russian Mafiosos; pretty soon, they&#x27;re ridding the city of
all crime czars, and a fey, gay Fed wants in on the excitement.
Dreadful, insulting script begins badly and keeps getting worse, and
the overscaled performances (which would be broad at fifty paces) are
shoved right up to the camera. Writer-director Troy Duffy hasn&#x27;t any
talent working with actors, and this cast is strictly on their own
(which may explain why Willem Dafoe turns in his very worst
performance). Duffy is no De Palma, and &#x22;The Boondock Saints&#x22; is no
&#x22;Scarface&#x22;. It may well be the most misguided mobster-drama ever made.
NO STARS from ****
