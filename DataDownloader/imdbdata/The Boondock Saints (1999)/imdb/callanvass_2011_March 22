(Credit IMDb) Two Irish brothers accidentally killed mafia thugs. They
turned themselves in and were released as heroes. They then see it as a
calling by God and started knocking off mafia gang members one by one.
Willem Dafoe plays the detective trying to figure out the killings, but
the closer he was to catching the Irish brothers, the more he thinks
the brothers are doing the right thing <br /><br />I was bored senseless by this &#x22;supposed&#x22; cult classic. It&#x27;s flamboyant,
raucous style was not too my liking. Dafoe in my opinion delivers an an
annoying, OTT performance that only made me annoyed by the film even
more.<br /><br />Performances Willem Dafoe is one of my favorite actors but I hated him
here. He was way too OTT in my opinion, over acting his role to epic
proportions. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus are both annoying
leads, who I didn&#x27;t get all the hoo-ha about.<br /><br />Bottom line. I&#x27;ve avoided the sequel for good reason. I&#x27;ll see it
sooner or later but after this disappointment I don&#x27;t have high hopes
for it. Loud leads, dull pace and overacting ruined this one for me.
Due to the reputation that proceeds it, you&#x27;ll probably want to see
this though.<br /><br />3/10
