In the great spirit of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; comes &quot;Boondock
Saints,&quot; a pale shadow of the first two films I just mentioned. There is
plenty of violence and bad language to go around here, but it never really
materializes past the point of being senseless.<br /><br />Willem Dafoe is good as Smecker, a cop investigating the &quot;Saints,&quot; two
brothers who feel they are doing the world good by personally ridding their
city of all evil men.<br /><br />The main problem with the film is the amount of unintentional humor that it
elicits, particularly with the Dafoe character. The movie wants to be
serious and have a message, but it just never happens. There is also a huge
credibility problem with placing porn legend Ron Jeremy in what is a
non-porn role. It is unintentionally funny to see him try and
act.<br /><br />The level of violence is so high that the viewer just becomes de-sensitized
by about the middle of the film. There is supposedly a director's cut of the
film which runs a half hour longer, sure to have even more bloodshed. The
violence is done in such a tasteless and sloppy manner that sometimes you
wonder if the actors are getting tired of it.<br /><br />There are many other films in the crime genre that I would recommend before
&quot;Boondock Saints.&quot; In an effort to be memorable, it really comes off as just
being unnecessary.<br /><br />Grade: C-
