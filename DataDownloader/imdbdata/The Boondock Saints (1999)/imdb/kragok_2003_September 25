This movie would have been better if for 1) It wasn't trying to be
Reservoir
Dogs, or Pulp Fiction.  2) if Defoe had never gotten in that dress I am
still scarred for life.<br /><br />This flick starts off promising but ultimately fall short, the mindless
violence is good at least to me and i liked the concept.  It's just it
could
have been better.  I probably wouldn't have added it to my dvd collection
if
my friend hadn't given it to me as a Birthday Gift.
It's not the worst movie i have ever seen, it's not the best either.
