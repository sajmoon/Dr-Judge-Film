Ignored upon its initial release The Boondock Saints went on to become
a cult sensation. People loved it, they thought it was the most amazing
thing ever. Well, except for those who hated it and thought it was the
dumbest, most vile thing they&#x27;d ever seen. Few movies split opinions to
such extremes like this one. Love it or despise it, no in between. It&#x27;s
brilliant. Or it&#x27;s hideous. So where does the truth lie? Well, right in
between of course.<br /><br />The movie centers around Irish twins Connor and Murphy MacManus who
will become vigilantes, taking it upon themselves to clean up Boston.
Crime lords, thugs and lowlifes will be ruthlessly dispatched in
extraordinarily bloody fashion. When the killings start FBI agent Paul
Smecker investigates. The introduction of the eccentric Smecker, played
to wonderful effect by Willem Dafoe, kicks the movie into high gear.
The actors playing the MacManus twins, Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman
Reedus, are perfectly fine but there never seems to be much depth to
their characters. They have very little to do except run around killing
people, moving from one bloodbath to another. It&#x27;s left to Paul Smecker
to pick up the pieces. And actually take some time to think. Nobody
else has much time to think in this movie, they&#x27;re too busy blowing
people&#x27;s brains out. Dafoe occasionally goes a bit over the top in his
portrayal of Smecker but honestly this whole movie is about going over
the top. Everything is big and bombastic. And bloody. So very, very
bloody.<br /><br />Critics will say that the the movie is full of contrivances necessary
to make the story work. That&#x27;s probably true. Some will be turned off
by the extreme violence. Some will argue that the whole thing is just
one big bloody mess, nothing but a bunch of killing and cursing. It is
all rather over the top. But is it too much? Probably not. The movie
stops just short of going overboard. We identify with our young Irish
vigilantes and root for them. Even if we&#x27;re not quite sure we should.
And even if their characters are never fleshed out particularly well.
You really wish there had been more here in terms of actual story. What
story there is often gets lost under seemingly gallons of blood. It&#x27;s
easy to see why people would love this movie. It&#x27;s also easy to see why
people would hate this movie. The truth is it&#x27;s not the greatest thing
ever seen, nor is it the worst. It&#x27;s a reasonably good, entertaining
movie packed with plenty of action. OK, it&#x27;s over the top action but
better that than no action at all. It&#x27;s a movie which certainly has its
flaws but there&#x27;s enough here to make it work.
