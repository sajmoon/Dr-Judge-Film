When he's not giving Gwyneth Paltrow a pedicure, what is Harvey Weinstein
doing when he reads genre scripts? It would seem that the corpulent
supergenius behind Miramax Films cannot perceive that RESERVOIR DOGS,
THINGS
TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD, and this stinkapalooza are not the same
exact movie. In a famous bit of lore, Weinstein bought the bar the
writer-director Troy Duffy used to work in as part of the
kiss-Duffy's-butt
ploy. In a less famous bit of lore, Weinstein lost interest as Duffy's
behavior became, shall we say, pugnacious, and sure enough, years after
the
bar-buying myth, THE BOONDOCK SAINTS opened in an ex-porn grindhouse in
Hollywood. It premiered on Blockbuster shelves a few days later. There is
a
reason for this bad luck. THE BOONDOCK SAINTS may be the worst mainstream
film of the nineties.<br /><br />Some are more noxious. KILLING ZOE and THE YOUNG POISONER'S HANDBOOK are
viler. But this one is ripe. Willem Dafoe is a gay Sherlock Holmes whom
we,
the presumably heterosexual audience, is supposed to root for when he
thunks
a lover's head and snorts, &quot;What a fag!&quot; Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman
Reedus are two Irish-American vigilantes rendered with much cuteness and
fake humor. The movie seems unsure whether it's IN LIKE FLYNT campy or
Bond-movie straight. There are also allusions to MEAN STREETS that just
don't help anybody. There is not an honest moment in this
movie.
