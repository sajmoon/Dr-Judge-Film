2011_March 3 
I was shown this movie by one of my friends years ago who said he
couldn&#x27;t believe that I had never seen it before. After I watched it, I
fell in love with it. This movie is not only action packed but it makes
you think the whole way through the movie. Also, it has tons of comical
scenes where I couldn&#x27;t help but laugh. Willem Dafoe does a great job
as a genius detective who does everything in a dramatic manner. Sean
Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus worked together beautifully as
brothers and show the importance of family to them. As for the rest of
the cast, they all do a great job bringing the movie together and Rocco
does a wonderful job as a crazy Italian guy. This movie was brought to
me when I never heard of it, and afterwards, I brought it to so many
who hadn&#x27;t heard of it either. It will keep you wanting to watch the
whole time.
