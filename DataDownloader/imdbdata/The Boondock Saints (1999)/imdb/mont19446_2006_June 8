Like many people, I had never heard of this movie until recently and
was shocked that such &quot;a well regarded movie&quot; had slipped past me. I
immediately went to the store but unfortunately found this movie
already checked out. Furthermore, the clerk instructed me there was a
waiting list and my name was buried at the bottom of a very long line.
I had to smile to myself and proceeded across town desperately looking
for another copy.<br /><br />I should have stopped looking then.<br /><br />Let&#39;s get the obvious right out of the way. Don&#39;t worry about spoiler
warnings. You&#39;ve seen it all before. Boondocks Saints is a
cut-and-paste version of better movies and blatantly lifts dialog from
another films. (ie &quot;No women. No kids.&quot;) Mentioning these directors or
comparing this movie to others would be a disgrace. You want to compare
this film to something? Feed a baby some Ex-lax and watch what comes
out. It&#39;ll be the Boondock Saints.<br /><br />Director Patrick Duffy also squandered a great opportunity to explore a
somewhat complicated premise. In today&#39;s society, is murder ever
justified? By Hollywood standards, this would constitute a real
head-scratcher, but instead you get the some old clich&eacute; explanations
and the movies marches forward looking for another opportunity to drop
the F-bomb. I still don&#39;t know why the two protagonists even did what
they set out to do.<br /><br />However, Boondock Saints does sets itself apart the other films it&#39;s
desperately trying to emulate. At least twice toward the end of the
film, the screenwriter implores the viewer to emulate the main
characters and makes an argument for killing ACCUSED criminals. Not
convicted criminals or prisoners mind you but perceived criminals.
Twice the movies says: &quot;we should have two of you in every town&quot; and
twice mentions recruiting others to their cause.<br /><br />You want to make dumb mindless action movie that depicts the killing
drug dealers, rapists and contract killer, be my guest. Go right ahead.
Make a dozen of them and I&#39;ll wish you luck every step of the way. Just
don&#39;t insinuate that the audience should pick up a gun when they leave
the theater.<br /><br />After watching this movie, I learned that Boondock Saints was
blackballed from theaters in 1999 for unknown reasons and the movie
only opened on 5 screens. Hollywood hasn&#39;t done many things right over
the years but shelving this cinematic mistake was step in the right
direction.<br /><br />Thinking of renting Boondock Saints? Heaven help us all.
