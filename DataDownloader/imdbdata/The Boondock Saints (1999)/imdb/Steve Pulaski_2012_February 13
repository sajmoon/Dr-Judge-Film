Cult films are some of the worst films to review. Especially when
they&#x27;ve been out for many years and people have already formed strong,
incorruptible opinions on them. I sometimes feel almost obligated to
award a cult film a very positive review because I don&#x27;t want to face
the backlash from fans and then be dismissed as someone who can&#x27;t
appreciate &#x22;cult art.&#x22; I&#x27;ve seen my share of cult films that I wholly
love, like The Rocky Horror Picture Show, some I found acceptable, The
Big Lebowski, and some I didn&#x27;t quite grasp, Wet Hot American Summer.
The Boondock Saints is a cult film I just can&#x27;t bring myself to say I
truly enjoyed.<br /><br />To be fair, it has a lot going for it. The plot itself is very slim,
focusing on two brothers, Connor (Flanery) and Murphy MacManus
(Reedus), who are strictly Catholic and enjoy cursing and shooting.
Seems like a contradiction. One day, while celebrating St. Patrick&#x27;s
Day, they are approached by three Russian mobsters who want to close
down the bar they are currently partying in. The next morning, they are
brutally attacked by the same trio, and the brothers wind up killing
the mobsters in an act of self-defense.<br /><br />The pair decide &#x22;we&#x27;re pretty good at killing, let&#x27;s become
vigilantes,&#x22; and thus the movie takes off. The merciless scenes of
brutality are often interrupted by an effortlessly fantastic Willem
Dafoe playing FBI Agent Paul Smecker, the man working the case of the
two men.<br /><br />From there on out, it&#x27;s shoot, run, jump, duck, reload, turn on the
slow motion, and repeat. The cinematography is top-notch and well worth
noticing. It&#x27;s the thing that kept me interested the whole time. The
first couple of scenes involving violence were nice and somewhat new
because slow-motion technology wasn&#x27;t a very ordinary thing (it didn&#x27;t
become fully noticed until a couple months later with The Matrix).
Ultimately, these scenes wear out their welcome pretty quickly.<br /><br />Willem Dafoe plays a pretty convincing agent, and both of the brothers
do a very fine job at acting, but the nail in the coffin is it is
shamelessly inspired by the work of Tarantino. The attempts at witty
dialog, the gratuitously violent set-pieces, and the overall look and
feel all appear to be directly lifted from films like Pulp Fiction and
Reservoir Dogs. The Boondock Saints knows how to incorporate style and
look to a film, but struggles to include anything unique or memorable
in terms of storytelling. It also doesn&#x27;t possess half the amount of
with that made Pulp Fiction so stellar. Even the God-fearing duo
reminds me of The Blues Brothers. It could be possible that these
brothers are on a deadly mission from God.<br /><br />The film also woefully misses its chance at throwing in some commentary
on vigilante justice and whether or not it should be welcomed or
feared. It just feels like it is trying to cover up the actions of the
two or justify them by saying &#x22;yeah, they kill a lot, but they&#x27;re very
religious and attend church often, so at least they sort of resemble
good, wholesome people.&#x22; The Boondock Saints isn&#x27;t a bad film, but
shamelessly overrated in terms of quality. It&#x27;s the underdog of
American cinema, becoming a runaway success on video, but was the
success worthy for such a film that, truthfully, isn&#x27;t as unique or as
entertaining as the title and plot suggest? The performances are great,
some scenes are worthwhile, but the depth is kiddie-pool deep and the
film makes a lackluster attempt at justifying itself by adding no
serious commentary on the issue of vigilante justice.<br /><br />Starring: Willem Dafoe, Sean Patrick Flanery, and Norman Reedus.
Directed by: Troy Duffy.
