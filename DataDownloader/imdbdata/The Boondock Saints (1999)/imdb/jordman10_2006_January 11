OK I don't care what anyone says this movie Really Really Really
Sucked. I mean it was terrible. Unlike Tarantino movies it was just
pure gore violence sex and language. No Character depth. No Real Plot.
No Real Diction. I mean I couldn't Understand a F***'n word they. I'm
mean they tried to copy Quentins Crap but completely missed the
freakin' point and the fact that everyone loved it prove's that 80% of
Americans are dumb ass's. Sacreligous and offensive to all I highly
recommend you don't see this movie. Just terrible. Terrible acting.
Terrible plot. Just an all out bad movie. I'm sitting watching a dude
feel up a dead chick and I'm just like F*** this. Turned it off and
watched Waynes world. Now Waynes World There's a Great Movie.
