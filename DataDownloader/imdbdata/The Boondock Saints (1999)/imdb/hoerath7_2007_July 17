I went into this film wanting to enjoy watching it because I have heard
so many good reviews over the past few years. As I watched this film I
was really disappointed with it as a whole. As someone who has been
studying film for years I screen a film differently than the average
home viewer, but even when a film isn&#39;t coming together I try to enjoy
it! I like to watch films succeed! This movie didn&#39;t work out at all.
The direction and script were probably the hugest failures. Without
terrible direction the acting might not have come across so misguided.
William Defoe was horrible in this and his character was unpredictable
and lacked any depth. Wish I had time to write up a complete
explanation of why this film falls flat on it&#39;s face, but it&#39;s safe to
say this movie isn&#39;t worth watching. It is unoriginal, predictable, and
not half as good as most made for TV movies. I think this film has such
high reviews because it struck a chord with the 15 year old kids who
are watching a rated R movie for the first time. They seem to worship
it as something unique. However, for grownups I would say this movie
doesn&#39;t amount to much of anything and you shouldn&#39;t waste your time.
DON&quot;T BE FOOLED BY THE GOOD REVIEWS DONE BY TEENAGERS&gt;&gt;&gt; THIS MOVIE IS
NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR MONEY!
