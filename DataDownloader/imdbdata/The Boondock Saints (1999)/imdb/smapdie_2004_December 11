I can't understand why this movie has such a high rating. Oh, wait, I
do - there is quite a large subset of people who want a tangible reason
to go out and murder people. If you have said to yourself recently, &quot;I
think that guy's bad, I should be allowed to kill him,&quot; this movie is
up your alley. If you truly don't find anything wrong with that
statement, this is probably your favorite movie. <br /><br />Despite what is logically wrong with the above statement, every other
sentiment in this movie is reprehensible. One of the main characters
(Dafoe), is a self-hating gay homicide detective who FINDS HIMSELF
SIDING WITH THE VIGILANTES IN THIS MOVIE. There are at least two things
wrong with that statement. He portrays the most unlikable,
unsympathetic character in cinematic history. The two main characters
(the brothers) are bad actors. Most likely, this is made far worse by
having plot holes one could navigate a cruise ship through. Dialog is
bad, plot is bad, characters are bad. This movie is cheesy. It appears
that a 12-year-old with behavioral problems wrote it. I would hope that
people watching this piece of dreck would not let their personal
politics enter into their view of this &quot;movie&quot; and see it for the awful
film it is, but I guess they do. Beyond my feelings about the ideology
behind this film, I still find it nauseating. It's like a somewhat
thought-provoking TV movie (the low-budget feel is ever-present). The
thought-provoking, sadly, is paper thin. The people who think the
brothers are right are just as bad as the people they are killing.<br /><br />Unless you're a passive-aggressive 12-year old who wants to find an
excuse to satiate the bloodlust in your heart, skip it. There is
nothing redeeming about this film, despite its purported &quot;high ideals&quot;.
Anyone can justify murder if they think hard enough. This movie doesn't
even think hard enough for a bowel movement.
