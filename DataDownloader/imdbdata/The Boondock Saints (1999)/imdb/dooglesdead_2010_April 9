2010_April 9 
Being once again dismayed by the ridiculous polarisation of reviewers&#x27;
opinions on the IMDb I think this movie at least deserves a fair
review, so...<br /><br />Personally, I was disappointed by this film. It has a pretty high
rating on this website and the story could have been absolute gold in
the hands of Tarantino, Ritchie or even Scorcese, but to be honest I
found the execution to be fairly mediocre- which I attribute to poor
directing. The dialogue is quite uninspired, but I suppose all in all
it&#x27;s solid (the odd good line), however the narrative struggles quite a
lot. In fact I, someone who watches this type of movie an awful lot,
didn&#x27;t really know where it was going for the first 25 minutes (but
then I don&#x27;t think the director did either)! &#x27;The Boondock Saints&#x27;
borrows heavily from the styles of Tarantino and Guy Ritchie, and this
alone isn&#x27;t a bad thing. What is a shame is that it often feels
borrowed, a bit like it was thought up by a 16 year old A-level student
who just saw Pulp Fiction and Lock Stock for the first time. I chuckled
two or three times during the movie but on the whole the stuff that was
meant to induce laughter was just stupid (i.e. Willem Dafoe&#x27;s
character&#x27;s oddities).<br /><br />I guess 7/10 is fairly generous, but the idea of this film is
fundamentally good- it brings up lots of interesting ideas and the
potential for some good scenes. Sadly, the director&#x27;s attempts at
unique style aren&#x27;t successful. The good cinematography often feels
like a copy, and the unique stuff is generally stilted and doesn&#x27;t add
to the movie. But as I opened by saying, in the right hands this movie
could have been 9/10 and awesome. Really, I guess I&#x27;m just hoping that
I&#x27;ll appreciate it more with a second watch, but I won&#x27;t find out for a
while!
