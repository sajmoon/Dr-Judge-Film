This movie is done by, clearly, a Quentin Tarantino wannbe. Only, the
writer/director of this movie doesn&#39;t have near the talent. (At least
at this point in his life.) The story is horrible; you can drive a
truck through at least 5 major plot holes. The acting? So-so. The
directing? What directing? After the opening sequences of this movie,
the directing devolves to a hack job.<br /><br />I just watched the movie &quot;Overnight,&quot; which is a documentary about Troy
Duffy, the director. I can totally understand why this movie didn&#39;t
sell in Cannes, even with Cassian Elwes as the agent in charge of
selling it. No distributor would buy this movie for a theatrical
release (of course), but home video, yeah, there was a market for this
there. It&#39;s got lots of violence and gunplay, so if that&#39;s all you care
about, you&#39;ll probably like this movie. The fact that half of the
violence in this movie is not motivated (and gratuitous)... hey, who
cares as long as there&#39;s blood and guts, right?? ***Spoiler Alert: And
the cat killing scene is a total rip-off from Pulp Fiction. I mean,
c&#39;mon, dude. How lame.<br /><br />I can also understand why this guy hasn&#39;t been able to get his 2nd
movie off the ground to date. I&#39;m sure he will at some point, but if I
was an investor, I wouldn&#39;t invest in this guy. At least not till he
develops his writing and directing ability more. Much more.<br /><br />For those who aspire to be filmmakers, or enjoy the inside scoop of
Hollywood, rent &quot;Overnight.&quot; It&#39;s a fascinating account of Troy Duffy&#39;s
self-destruction.
