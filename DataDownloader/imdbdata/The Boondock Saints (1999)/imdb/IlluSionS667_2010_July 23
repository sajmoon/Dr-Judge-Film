&#x22;The Boondock Saints&#x22; seems to be one of those films you either hate or
love. I&#x27;m most definitely among the lovers out there and the reason for
this is simple : out of all action films I&#x27;ve ever seen, &#x22;The Boondock
Saints&#x22; seemed the most entertaining, the most visually appealing, the
most original and the funniest to me.<br /><br />Sure, &#x22;The Boondock Saints&#x22; is no &#x22;Citizen Kane&#x22;, but that&#x27;s something
I never expected in the first place. There are some major plot holes,
most characters are caricatures and the acting isn&#x27;t the best around,
but if you manage to ignore this there is a lot to like about this
film.<br /><br />Being raised in a Flemish labor class family, my cultural background is
very much like that of the two main characters. As such, I found the
motivations, the philosophy, the personalities and humor of the main
characters very recognizable and very appealing. I suspect this may
also be a major reason why there are so many haters. If you do not have
any affinity with Irish labor class culture or mentality, then you may
just not &#x22;get it&#x22;. I&#x27;m not saying you must be a factory worker to like
this film, though. My own job is programming web applications.<br /><br />Then there&#x27;s the visuals. Duffy opted for a non-linear way of telling
his story that with a unique combination of fast-paced action, some
experimental editing and a matching music score. While &#x22;Pulp Fiction&#x22;
undoubtedly inspired Duffy&#x27;s style, it&#x27;s still far too different from
Tarantino&#x27;s typical style or anything else I&#x27;ve ever seen to be
considered a rip-off. Tarantino based his own style on the dozens of
films from the &#x27;70s he saw as a teenager, but does that make &#x22;Reservoir
Dogs&#x22; and &#x22;Pulp Fiction&#x22; any less original or unique?<br /><br />Most of all, though, &#x22;The Boondock Saints&#x22; is just fun. Invite some of
your friends over, grab a few beers and just enjoy the fact-paced
action, the sometimes very foul-mouthed or very dark humor and debate
with your friends whether you&#x27;d think it would be a blessing or a curse
if &#x22;The Boondock Saints&#x22; were actually real and not just a story made
up by Duffy. For me, that&#x27;s the perfect setting for a film like this.
