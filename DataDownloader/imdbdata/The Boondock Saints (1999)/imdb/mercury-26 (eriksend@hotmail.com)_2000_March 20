2000_March 20 

If not for a few interestingly conceived and staged action sequences, I
would have walked out of the theater before intermission (that's why there
are no more intermissions in movies: too many people would just leave most
films). Fortunately, and for good reason, &quot;Saints&quot; went straight to video
and I got to watch it from the comfort of my easy chair.  I watched it
because others said it was good.  I can almost see why others liked it but
this just wasn't my bag.<br /><br />Boondock Saints is about ridding society of its problems through violence,
violence justified by a criminal justice system that has failed us.
There's
a lot that first-time director Duffy gets right. He certainly communicates
what he perceives as the collective ideology and does it with considerable
visual style.<br /><br />Though it may never happen in today's Hollywood, this might have been good
as a silent film. The best reason? The script is aweful!  Every character
(except Willem Dafoe's character) is a cardboard cutout. I didn't know
Conner and Murphy MacManus (the title characters, played by Sean Patrick
Flanery and Norman Reedus respectively) any better than I did after I saw
the film than before.<br /><br />Fraternal twins who are all the family each other has, end up killing two
members of the Russian mafia and in doing so become heroes of the Boston
Police.  Instead of waiting for the mafia to hunt them down, the twins
become vigilantes and begin systematically executing criminals that, for
whatever reason, the police can't bring in. I think what Mr. Duffy has
done
with Conner and Murphy is intentionally treat them as one character.
Neither, other than having a different face, is distinguishable from the
other (being a fraternal twin myself, I find this interesting at best).
You'd think that between the two of them, they might be able to come up
with
enough personality to fill one whole person. Doesn't happen.  Despite
this,
we're expected to find these two intriguing simply because the odds are
against them.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I wanted to like this film.  Willem Dafoe's gay FBI
agent is a leap above anything we've seen and Dafoe gives it his all.  If
this movie could be saved, this would be the character to do it.  The
character, Paul Smecker, takes over the investigation of the dead, broken
bodies of two Russian mobsters found in an alley.  Before the mobsters'
bodies are cold, however, more criminals start ending up dead.  As the
investigation progresses, Smecker becomes more and more enraptured by the
executioners' style.  From the moment we meet this guy, he's re-enacting
each crime moment by moment.  One thing I will say for Duffy--the guy's
got
potential as a director.  The crime scenes are usually shown and THEN
we're
shown the executions themselves.  We watch it unfold as Smecker breaks it
down.  There's one superb scene in which Smecker WALKS THROUGH THE SCENE
with the Saints as they go about their work.<br /><br />The innovative directing, however, isn't enough to save this movie from
its
too-often stupid dialogue.  I see that on this movie's main page, the user
comment calls it &quot;entertainment in the tradition of 'Pulp Fiction.'&quot;  It's
violent, has characters who enjoy using the f-word (on an unprecedented
scale), and it messes with time the way only the film medium can, so of
course we have to compare it to Pulp Fiction.  When anyone learns to
think,
visualize, and write the way Tarantino does, THEN we can make those kinds
of
comparisons.  I expect that Duffy is continuing to write and improve his
craft.  He has the tools, but needed a second set of eyes much of the time
here.<br /><br />Blockbuster's been promoting it heavily, making it seem like more than
what
it is: amateurish. It's like a student film that manages to look like a
studio film at times.  I fell for it, I admit it (had it not been for the
fifty copies sitting on the shelf, I wouldn't have gone anywhere near it).
Unfortunately, more people will see this movie than it deserves.<br /><br />Grade:  D
