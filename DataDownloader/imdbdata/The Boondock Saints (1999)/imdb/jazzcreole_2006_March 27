How awful. Willem Defoe over-the-top? Who told David Rocco that he
could act? The script could have been written by my 13 year old. Please
don't waste your time. There's very poor background on the two main
characters and no explanation on why they wanted to become avenging
angels. There are too many characters in this movie just standing
around. I want to warn folks about this be how can I do this without
revealing a few spoilers? I thought I would see a story about Irish or
Italians in South Boston. But it's not even filmed there. The opening
scene in the church is never explained. The DVD extras were not much
help -- some deleted scenes and trailers for the film.
