2002_August 25 

I watched this movie on the recommendation of a friend of mine a couple of
weeks ago.  As a matter of fact, that friend watched it with me, and out
of
respect I sat on my couch and watched the entire movie without saying what
was really on my mind.  As soon as the final credits roled I felt it was
my
duty to speak up.  This movie SUCKED!!!  I couldn't believe what I had
just
witnessed...a terrible script (with holes so wide you could drive a truck
through it), incredibly bad acting (especially Rocco and the Russian
mobster
who had his ass bandaged), poor action scenes (why the slow motion?), and
some of the worst Irish accents I have ever heard.  The next day I went to
IMDB to see what the masses had to say.  I was stunned to see such a high
rating.  I thought there was something wrong with ME so I went back and
watched this movie again.  Much to my surprise I did find two redeeming
qualities in this flick.  The first was when the cat got his head blown
off
and the second was when Rocco bit the dust (no sequel for him).  I'm sure
Mr. Duffy is a good guy, but next time write a script that doesn't seem
like
it was written by my 10 year old nephew.<br /><br />
