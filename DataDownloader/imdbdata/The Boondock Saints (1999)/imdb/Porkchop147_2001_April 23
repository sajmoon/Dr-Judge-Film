2001_April 23 

This is not a terrible film, but it's certainly no masterwork.  It is
abundantly obvious that it was put together by a first time writer/director
struggling to find a voice and a style.  He tries out some John Woo, some
Scorsese, a lot of Tarantino, and innumerable other imitations, and the
result is a confused mish mash.  Individual scenes are not badly done, but
they don't gel when taken as a whole.  Often we are left with little sense
of where we are or how we got there.  There are huge leaps of narrative
logic that are very difficult to accept.  The dialogue is sometimes clever,
and at other times tries too hard to be.<br /><br />That being said, some of the acting is excellent, especially from Sean
Patrick Flannery whose Irish accent seems flawless and whose performance is
intense and likeable.  Willem Dafoe is very good, though sometimes over the
top.  And some scenes are genuinely funny, others genuinely
exciting.<br /><br />But it's hard to overlook the film's unabashed glorification of vigilante
violence.  It makes a feeble, half-hearted attempt to show the other side of
the argument during the ending credits, but it feels tacked on and, like
many other parts of the film, doesn't mesh with the rest very well.  Mostly
the film revels in behaviour that is morally questionable and made me more
than a little uncomfortable.
