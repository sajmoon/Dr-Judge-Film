It is easy to see why this screenplay created a buzz in Hollywood.
Movies today are all about other movies. Tarantino references nothing
but. He isn&#39;t the inventor of this, but he did bring it to a new level
of self-aware irony.<br /><br />So its something when a script comes along from a fellow who knows
nothing about other films. This is more a sketch for a clever book. But
then he applies the same veneer as Ritchie and Tarrantino and the &#39;Go&#39;
guy. It is a reverse irony, a selfconscious goof on their own
selfconsciousness. To make it obvious, he has our hapless murderers
deliberately act like they were in a movie, often arguing about it
&#39;Bronson always takes a rope.&#39;<br /><br />He directs, and the results aren&#39;t pretty. He muffs all the effects he
is quoting, but that is so entirely apt, so entirely what he is all
about (without knowing it) it works.<br /><br />The key role here is played by Dafoe, who knows something about reverse
self-reference. He played a key role in one of the earliest reverse
self-referential projects &#39;eXistenZ,&#39; and more recently in the very
best, the gold standard: &#39;Shadow of the Vampire&#39; a film about a film
about filming vampires where the top level has the vampire as real. He
knows what to do and since the director is weak, he does what he wants.<br /><br />His character is the cross between the detective who is trying to
discover the story and the avatar for the director who is writing the
story. There&#39;s a rather nice scene where he is anachronistically in the
action, narrating it -- and getting it wrong.<br /><br />I&#39;ll take one of these over twelve McMullen brothers any day.<br /><br />Ted&#39;s evaluation: 2 of 4 -- has some interesting elements
