Almost everyone I know has been raving about this movie for some time.
After
seeing it, I'm wondering what all the fuss is about. &quot;Boondock Saints&quot;
borrows so liberally from the visual/narrative techniques of Tarantino,
Fincher, Smith, Ritchie, etc. it's almost embarrassing. Fragmented
narratives, ultra-hip protagonists, kinetic montages, the F-word every
other
sentence -- it just seems done to death by now, especially when executed
by
what seems like the &quot;How to be a Cool 90s Filmmaker&quot; handbook. The two
leads
double-fist handguns like a pair of Chow-Yun McFats and have enough time
to
get in some witty, at times pop-culture concerned, repartee. People get
into
tough guy shouting match confrontations because that's what all tough
protagonists have done since the early-mid-90s. Dafoe's FBI agent
character
listens to opera when trying to figure a crime scene so it'll lend an air
of
pseudo-artsy-fartsiness that people will mistake for some form of
profundity
-- the religious aspect also seems added for a similar
reason.<br /><br />Still, the movie does have it's brighter moments. When &quot;Boondock Saints&quot;
stops aping other movies and comes into its own, the film actually starts
to
get good. The moral ambivalence of vigilante justice is an interesting
notion, but it hardly gets developed in the film until the very end. This
issue is passed over instead for shouting matches and flashback-driven
fragmented narratives. If the movie just didn't try so hard to be edgy and
just tried to be true to its material, a better movie more worthy of such
praise would have been the end result.<br /><br />If only &quot;Boondock Saints&quot; had just been itself (a rather modest crime and
vigilante movie) and not what it turned out to be (a flick too hip for its
own good), maybe then I'd see what all the hype was about. It is an
entertaining movie, but in my opinion is not on the same level as the
movies
and filmmakers it so blatantly takes from. 6/10
