2009_October 30 
I&#x27;ve heard allot about this movie over the last few years people all
over have been praising it as a mild stone in film making. Calling it a
cult classic and one of the best action dramas ever put to film, well
I&#x27;m sorry to say they were wrong. This movie was nothing like people
advertised and boasted about, it was at times very hard to discern what
was going on and who was killing who and what was really going on in
the film.<br /><br />The Boondock Saints boast a cool and hip visual style that resonates
with the best action films of the 80&#x27;s and early 90&#x27;s and some of John
Woo&#x27;s japan work before he moved to America. But even that can&#x27;t save
this film from being highly overrated and contrived. TBS was great on
the action and humor(what little it had if there wasn&#x27;t a curse word in
it.)It tires so very hard to be convincing, powerful, emotional and
most of all smart but it can&#x27;t under the dumb down dialogue and the
poor execution of the film. The mediocre script and direction of Troy
Duffy who I&#x27;ve never heard and for good reasons. You see Duffy tries to
create a movie where two brothers who are devoted to each other and
devoted to helping the little people think there doing God&#x27;s work by
killing all theses mob boss and criminals where in reality there
actually psycho killers just mopping up the scum in south Boston. I
like the style of the film and I liked the way it played out, but if
Duffy had just thought it out more and put a more dramatic and
emotional effect into the film, then maybe, just maybe, this film would
have made my top ten list sadly it makes my top ten list of the worst
films of the 90&#x27;s. But none the less it had the heart, it had the
spirit and it had the strength to be great and groundbreaking bu sadly
it falls short due to bad plotting, on par acting, a terrible script
and bad action sequences that don&#x27;t really dazzle you or blow your
mind.<br /><br />Sean Patrick Flanery(Who I never hear of besides this movie.) Plays one
of the Mac Manus brothers, he does pretty good here and does try hard
to be convincing. But he fails under Duffy&#x27;s bad script and poor
direction and thus is kind of an eye sore with his bad Irish accent.
Norman Reedus(Another actor I&#x27;ve never heard of outside this film.) Is
areal downside in this with his bad acting he really brings down his
character and makes it nothing more than a brainless thug who say a
pray for the men they are about to kill. Billy Connolly(Who is alright
for the few minutes he&#x27;s actually in the movie.) is pretty good in this
and is one of the higher class acts in the film, he brings some
ruthless style and cunning to a very simple character and does well
with his time on screen. Willem Dafoe(the saving grace in this film.)
Is fantastic in it and is the only reason to see this film besides the
slick, but highly under done, action sequences. He brings up the
quality of this film and elevates it to from bad to alright. But again
even he can&#x27;t save this film from crumbling under it&#x27;s own failure. But
none the less the cast does there best with the material there given
and tries there hardest to make this a great film, but sadly they
can&#x27;t.<br /><br />The Boondock Saints is dark,violent and sacrilegious, that pretty much
sums up the main focal point of this film plot and story and it tells
you all you need to know about the film in general. It boast a hip,
cool and vibrant style of film making and that can&#x27;t save it from be a
by the book action film with not so special action sequences. All in
all The Boondock Saints is passing entertainment bu nothing more.
