How do you take such great characters and writing from the last film
and turn it into this cheap TV movie stodge.<br /><br />The humor isn&#x27;t funny.<br /><br />The action is poorly shot with lame effects.<br /><br />The hot chick is a shockingly bad actress with awful lines.<br /><br />The new side kick while a good actor (in other films) in this movie is
almost like a parody of a side kick. Just Stupid, he looks like Joe
Dirt.<br /><br />The message of the first film is lost. The mob guys are just ridiculous
and not threatening or convincing.<br /><br />The back story of Il Duce is not that convincing ether.<br /><br />Even just the stupidity of the mob guy wearing his orthodontic brace
while people are at his house, when they are only ever worn to bed?? It
is like taking Bad Boys 1 and then making Blazing Saddles as the
sequel.<br /><br />And then you call one of your characters Gorgeous George, hmmmm...
already taken in Snatch, why would you do that to yourself.
