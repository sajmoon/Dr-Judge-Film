Boondock Saints:<br /><br />&quot;Thou shalt not kill. It's the one commandment they cannot keep. Tough,
stylish and extreme, fans of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction will
thrill to the action, intensity and intelligence of this modern day
morality tale written in blood. Starring Willam Dafoe (The English
Patient), Sean Patrick Flanery (Powder), and Norman Reedus 8MM. When
the sadistic Russian mob starts muscling in on their South Boston Irish
neighborhood, Connor and Murphy McManus know what must be done. Feeling
that the vengeance of God is flowing through their veins, they set out
to rid the streets of gangsters, criminals and lowlifes. As the body
count rises, the brothers became local heroes. Now, one unorthodox FBI
agent must be cunning enough to bring them down. &quot;<br /><br />What a stupid piece of trash. First off, there ARE no more Irish gangs
in America. The &quot;south Boston Irish neighborhood&quot; was poor in this
movie. There ARE no more poor new england Irish neighborhoods. This
movie reeks of a screenplay and director that desperately want to make
being Irish in America look glamorous, amazingly catholic, and violent.
They're so Americanized that it's the best they can do to rely on
outdated stereotypes to assert their fading heritage. Please- i saw
right through it. Second off, the only 3 times i saw a woman in this
masturbatory, gun filled male fantasy was when they were being
threatened with guns, pulled by the hair, and cussed at. The one woman
who was respectable was the cute &quot;Irish&quot; news reporter. Notice that.
Could this get any more irritating? Yes. It could and it did. Not only
were there Irish &quot;gangs,&quot; there were evil Russian mobsters, snide
Italian gangsters, and the lone Jewish clown who serves as a punching
bag for jokes and physical clips throughout the movie. All of these
people fight, say &quot;fuck&quot; like it's going out of style, and kill, kill,
kill. And please, a detective that listens to opera while examining a
crime scene? I can almost hear the director coming all over himself.
&quot;Cult movie&quot; or not, this is ridiculous and a total waste of time. It's
so full of itself as to suggest pretension. <br /><br />I'd have to say the historical inaccuracy got to me the most.<br /><br />Note to the director- Hey. You may have some Irish descent (wowie!),
but you must get used to the fact that you've been doing fine all your
life (no gangs or drugs, a life in the suburbs) and that most people of
Irish descent don't glamorize it the way you do. Nor would they ever.
Stupid.
