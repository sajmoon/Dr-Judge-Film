&#x22;The Italian Mafia&#x22; and &#x22;Russian Crime Syndicate&#x22; are a step away from
the bloody war in Boston, while a couple of Irish guys with his friends
beat coming to them in the pub thugs, who in turn would give them the
beer itself. After the movie characters - two Irish brothers - met with
the same thugs at home in his apartment, and very pathetic kill them.
For this they get into a prison cell and there, quote, &#x22;One day they
was enlightened: God himself had sent them to the ground on a special
mission by giving the holy power to cleanse the world from evil.&#x22; So in
other words, based on two adult man Hard beds in a cool jail cell and
then sleep through them becomes the Almighty with the message &#x22;soak in
all the scum in the city.&#x22; There. Such a description ... Stop! I find
the idea of a plot of this movie stupid? <br /><br />You know, after you read the description for this film, I think you
should not watch the whole thing to see that the very stupid idea of
this cold,rustic and too sluggish thriller from director Troy Duffy,
the way other producer and founder of Miramax, &#x22;Harvey Weinstein, which
was the sole cause of the birth of this film.<br /><br />After the failure of the &#x22;saints&#x22; in movie theaters and a release on
DVD in the circles of the audience this movie was mistakenly recognized
as a &#x22;cult&#x22; and even replete with reviews in the style of the same in
the spirit of Tarantino and Guy Ritchie! &#x22;. Stupid and I&#x27;ll explain
why. The film, for all his, as I wrote, it&#x27;s silly and delusional story
devoid of at least some self-irony, witty black humor (which is so
characteristic of Guy Ritchie), interesting quotes to classic movies
past (it just did could bring together the tape with the style of
Quentin Tarantino ) and in the end at least some charm. Apparently the
words &#x22;in the style of Tarantino&#x27;s&#x22; man in the street understands only
the criminal theme of the plot, and a dozen flat &#x22;black&#x22; jokes.<br /><br />More on the story ...<br /><br />At some point, the brothers are taking to his team a third, more
&#x22;manic&#x22; Saint, Rocco (aka actor David Della Rocco), who gives the film
a sour, sexist charge from which he would never be able to get out.<br /><br />Now a team of FBI interest in the saints, in particular Detective Paul
Smeker (Defoe), which differs from many other detectives strange
behavior. Every time he appears on the scene, where our heroes are
visited by the Irish, it comes with a &#x22;psychic&#x22; connection and repeats
all the movements performed by them on the spot. All this takes place
under nice-awful &#x22;Slow-mo, the sounds of moaning chorus of mourning and
pouring the detective later.<br /><br />Of course, all that pathos of the shootings, and in particular the
final credits may cause an ordinary viewer reflex reaction to the
perception of the entire movie as a brilliant criminal fighters, and
even socially important (!!!) movie that anyone over thirty will cause
confusion.<br /><br />Troy Duffy, a properly noticed by a film critic, this man whom
Tarantino would not want to become. During his career he managed to
remove only two films, and even despite good sales of DVD and the
status of &#x22;cult&#x22; producers do not want to have anything to do with him,
including his friend, one of the founders of Miramax. For this film, at
best, be treated as a pitiful parody of &#x22;Hard Boiled&#x22; in John Woo&#x27;s
&#x22;deceptive&#x22; wrapped the independent film era of the 90 Sundance Film
Festival.
