It's not immediately apparent what goal Troy Duffy had in mind when he
wrote The Boondock Saints.<br /><br />In this film, we follow two Irish brothers on a mission from God to rid
Earth of all evil, but the film is vague regarding the questionable
righteousness of their deeds. Instead, it shows the brothers as they
see themselves, as martyrs suffering torture and self-mutilation
rivalling the scourging of Christ (or at least, that seems to be the
idea) in their quest for holy righteousness.<br /><br />They also receive approval from the FBI agent assigned to their case,
but in the end, it's left very much up to the viewers to decide whether
the brothers are doing a good thing or not.<br /><br />One could suspect that that was the point of the film, but while I see
no problem in a film raising such questions, The Boondock Saints hardly
does that very well, with its imbecile jokes, and lack of plot and
believable characters.<br /><br />Could it then be that Troy Duffy is merely expressing his beliefs, and
genuinely wants us to sympathize with these two holier-than-you
brothers and their vigilant justice? If so, it's not working at all -
for me, anyway.<br /><br />In the end, one reach the sad conclusion that this is likely just
another violent action film trying to attain depth, but failing
miserably.
