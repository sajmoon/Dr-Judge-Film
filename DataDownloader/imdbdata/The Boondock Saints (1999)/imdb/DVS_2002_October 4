Being a big fan of the 'genre' (if you can call it that), I was expecting
Boon Dock Saints to be a lot more entertaining. What I found was far from
what I expected. Judging by IMDB.com's 7.7 rating, this couldn't be any
less
than a masterpiece, I thought. I'm not quite sure what gave this movie
it's
'amateurish' feel, but I suppose it might have something to do with how
poorly each actor seemed to grasp their role.   The dialogue was bland,
the
directing uninspired, and the acting simply poor. The movie borrowed
heavily
from movies like L&eacute;on (The Professional) and Pulp Fiction, but in it's
effort to be like the classics of the genre, turned out to be little less
than a weak attempt at a 'cool crime movie'. Tarantino and Besson, to me,
are still the only 2 directors capable of making movies like this work.
Definitely not a masterpiece, but also not quite unbearable.<br /><br />
