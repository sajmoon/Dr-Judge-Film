Pros: Good visuals; decent soundtrack; good general idea for a
movie.<br /><br />Cons: Utter cr*p for a script; very bad acting overall with only few
exceptions; laughable, pathetic characters; illogical, predictable,
stupid.<br /><br />I can't believe action movies can get THIS bad these days. The idiotic
excuse-for-a-script serves only two purposes: some excuse for on-screen
violence and the use of the f-word as pretty much the only verb the
&quot;characters&quot; use in their communication. Is this supposed to be funny or
have some &quot;deeper meaning&quot; or something? Compared to the others in the genre
-- &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;, &quot;Lock, Stock &amp; Two Smoking Barrels&quot;,
&quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;, &quot;Dobermann&quot;, &quot;Dogma&quot; -- this one is an unbelievable
pile of garbage and a real PAIN to sit through. Do not even bother to
rent.<br /><br />p.s. A Russian mafia boss with a surname of Pavlova? Heck, why didn't they
just name him Mary-Ann?
