I'm always surprised at how many people enjoy this movie. so many
people told me how awesome it was that I had no choice but to watch it.
when i finally did i came to the conclusion that its just a poorly
thought up movie with very very average if not below average acting.
willem defoe has a decent performance here but its not going to make
this one a keeper. i love action flicks but i need to be able to
believe it can happen to some degree. i just don't get it, the accents
aren't even good. nothing really fits in place to me. the simple
mindedness of our hero's doesn't add to my enjoyment either. hell, the
action scenes weren't even that entertaining. different strokes for
different folks i suppose.
