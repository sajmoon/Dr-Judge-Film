My roommate made me watch this because it's one of his favorites, and,
open-minded person that I am, I decided to give it a chance. Based on
what he said, I thought it sounded pretty good. A movie about two
brothers who become local heroes by defending their town against
mobsters can't be all bad, right?<br /><br />WRONG. This is the WORST MOVIE EVER. I don't know why there are so many
positive comments about it. Honestly, how could this many people watch
it and not realize how stupid it is? I suspect some people have been
paid to write this stuff.<br /><br />First of all, the director apparently has no idea what type of movie
he's making. Is it an action flick? A drama? A comedy? Who knows!? You
could turn this into a game of Guess the Genre: every time it feels
like it's settling down into a certain mood, try to guess which
completely different mood it will swing into next! Hint : you can tell
a genre switch is coming up whenever the soundtrack switches from
traditional Irish folk music to electric guitar.<br /><br />Add some incredibly bad acting, Willem DaFoe as an unrealistically 
FBI agent (or an &quot;unorthodox&quot; agent as the back cover puts it), blatant
Quentin Tarantino rip-offs, and a stupid plot about a couple of dorks
who kill in the name of God, and you have got yourself one seriously
bad movie. I just don't understand why people like this. If you haven't
seen it, consider yourself lucky.<br /><br />2/10 stars.
