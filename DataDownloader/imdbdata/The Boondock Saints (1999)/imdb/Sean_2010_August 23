If this movie was called &#x27;Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s Roman Catholic Power
Rangers&#x27;, you might have a better idea of what you&#x27;re in store for with
Boondock Saints. But stay with me, O gentle reader, it shouldn&#x27;t work
but it does. The action scenes are bloody, slick and well choreographed
- the kind you might embarrassingly catch a grown man acting out in
front of a mirror in their shorts (shut up, we all do it)- yet the
dialogue bizarrely has the real feel of heavy stage direction in it.
Sometimes one character will shout something, then strike a pose or put
his head in his hands while the other character gets to do his line,
then become reanimated when its his turn again, like an amateur theatre
production. I kept waiting for them to shout to The Virgin Mary &#x22;We
Need Dinozord Power Now!&#x22; as a form of the &#x22;Ezekiel 25:17&#x22; speech in
Tarantino&#x27;s Pulp Fiction is played out all through this movie. The
strange (perhaps unintentional) disconnect the
not-quite-for-screen-acting creates removed it enough from reality to
allow me to smile and cheer when someone gets shot and feel good about
it, but there was always the slight fear they&#x27;d finally break into a
musical number, which is something truly too disturbing for the big
screen. Thankfully - and I hope this isn&#x27;t too much of a spoiler - they
never actually start prancing around singing show tunes! All in all, it
sounds terrible - and could well be to many other people - but I&#x27;m
giving it a seven out of ten for being an entertaining one of a kind,
although I suspect it to be a fluke. If it was any camper or any
grittier it would have been unbearable.
