2006_June 30 
As I checked &quot;The Boondock Saints&quot; out from my friendly college
library, I was told by an IFL teacher that the film was &quot;very popular
among male college students.&quot; I believe she excised the end of that
phrase, which was probably: &quot;...under the heavy influence of several
pints.&quot; After hearing a lot of word-of-mouth recommendation (including
a former drunken college roommate) for the past few years, I finally
broke down and picked it up. Regardless of how good or bad &quot;Boondock&quot;
wound up being, I would at least be able to say &quot;I saw it.&quot; (Someday, I
hope to have that etched on my tombstone.) And exactly how bad is &quot;The
Boondock Saints&quot;? (Puts on Professional Party Pooper Hat) Pretty damn
bad. Here we have a movie that tosses the stylings of Tarantino
(&quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;), Rodriguez (&quot;El Mariachi&quot;), Woo, Scorsese, Winner
(&quot;Death Wish&quot;), Stone (&quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; in particular) and even
Singer (&quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;) into a blender, and the end result is
uniformly awful all around.<br /><br />The Plot: Sean Patrick Flanery (proving there&#39;s no life after &quot;The
Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot;) and Norman Reedus (&quot;8mm&quot;) play
devoutly religious Irish brothers living in Boston; when the Russian
mafia begins to infiltrate their territory, they become relentless
vigilantes, not only offing the Russians, but any generic scum who
crosses their path. In an outrageously flamboyant performance, Willem
Dafoe (who provides the film&#39;s only glimmers of humor) plays an
deductive FBI agent who pieces together the crimes. The plot, however,
is such a mess--perhaps deliberately so--that the film jumps from one
clumsily-executed setpiece after another, pinning us to the wall with
so much badly-edited &#39;action&#39; that one questions whether the filmmakers
were so naive to think we wouldn&#39;t take notice.<br /><br />As written and directed by novice auteur Troy Duffy, &quot;The Boondock
Saints&quot; is pretentious, would-be crime thriller dreck that carries a
pungent aftertaste of arrogance on the filmmaker&#39;s behalf. The film is
ineptly edited, poorly acted (everyone kicks &#39;shrill&#39; and &#39;shouting&#39; up
to the highest possible decibel), lazily satirical (&quot;Death Wish&quot; and
&quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; did it first, and--mostly--better), and--for all
the slow-motion action contained within--no fun to watch. Potential
stabs at humor are lost in the sea of poor sound recording and even
worse accents (sheesh, could it be any more obvious that Flanery and
Reedus ARE NOT Irish?). The one &#39;joy&#39; of &quot;The Boondock Saints&quot; is
watching Willem Dafoe wig out grandly in a role he probably thought
would never see the light of day, but even his presence doesn&#39;t elevate
this above borderline-unwatchable &#39;entertainment.&#39;
