2000_January 7 

The good elements consists of Dafoe's wonderful acting, and some nice filmic
tricks, especially the mixing of past and present. <br /><br />However, this is totally offset by a series of badly thought out ideas.
First of all, this film states that it is correct to kill the bad guys, as
long as it is done in the name of God -'turn-the-other-cheek' and
'love-your-enemy' appear to have been forgotten for this advertisement for
vigilantes and the NRA. And moreover it states that it is legal to define
precisely what is bad - e.g. the scene in the sex shop where two irrelevant
people are shot for no apparent reason. Watching nude women behind a window
(safe sex if anything?!) suddenly becomes bad also. <br /><br />Secondly it states that the more violent you get, the better. Especially
because the film states that even the law enforcers prefers to use the
old-fashioned western-style lynching methods to the judicial systems of the
democratic nation of the USA. <br /><br />Finally, this film tries to walk the path of 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Lock,
Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels'. It fails miserably. While 'Pulp' and 'Lock'
both are quite violent, the Boondock Saint has absolutely none of the charms
of its predecessors. And it lacks the stringent plot-line and brilliant
manuscripts of the other two and loses its story in a pool of blood and
gore. Thus it becomes boring. <br /><br />Too bad - it is rubbish, and deserves my first 1/10 at
IMDb.
