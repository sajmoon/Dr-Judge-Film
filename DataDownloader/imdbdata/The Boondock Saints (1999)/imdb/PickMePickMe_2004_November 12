I&#x27;m pretty sure from the director&#x27;s self-aggrandizing banter that this
movie is not meant to be a satire or spoof. Yes, it&#x27;s that bad.
Unrealistic, stilted dialogue, and a plot that is completely
nonsensical give the viewer mainly a sense of wonder: &#x22;how the hell did
this movie ever get made with this cast?&#x22; Several of the cast members
are actors who should have known better than to wallow in this dreck
(Billy Connolly, Willem DaFoe).<br /><br />I seriously cannot think of a worse movie than this. This guy makes Ed
Wood look like a meticulous genius.<br /><br />It&#x27;s a thirteen year old boy&#x27;s idea of what a film should be. A
thirteen year old boy who&#x27;s been locked in a cellar his whole life and
forced to say prayers over and over by an evil father.<br /><br />Relationships are nonexistent, women are seen only briefly, and then
only to shout at and threaten. There&#x27;s a lot of shouting in this movie.
Mebbe he figured if he told the actors to shout then they wouldn&#x27;t
notice that the lines were laughably bad.<br /><br />There are many Tarantino rip-offs in the film, but this filmmaker
clearly hasn&#x27;t the first idea what the hell he&#x27;s doing.<br /><br />The only positive thing about this excrescence of a film is that if
this complete vacuum-devoid-of-talent that is the filmmaker can get
money to make a movie, then you can, too!<br /><br />This movie has some appeal to adolescents and religious fanatics since
the movie is made in a very adolescent way.<br /><br />This is a perfect movie for white trash, callow youth, red state rubes,
and those with only 3 working brain cells.<br /><br />If you do not fall into any of the above categories, instead rent the
film &#x22;Overnight&#x22;, which documents the making of this film and how
incredibly arrogant the filmmaker is. You can witness his rise and fall
and how his lack of talent and supersize ego killed his career. It&#x27;s
highly entertaining and you don&#x27;t need to rent &#x22;Boondock Saints&#x22; to get
a sense of how truly awful the movie he made is. Just rent &#x22;Overnight&#x22;
- it&#x27;s worth it.
