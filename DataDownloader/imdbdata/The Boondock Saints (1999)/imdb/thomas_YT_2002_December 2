This movie perfectly fails in giving an impulse to think about taking law
into own hands. Don't get me wrong, I knew it was a crime/action movie.
Does
this mean, no criticism needed? It claims to be neutral in the end, but
through the hole story it sympathizes with the poor handsome men who kill
for a better world.
My first opinion was, it is intended to see the main actors with
sympathy, I
waited for these guys to turn bad. Instead you watch them enjoy it to
kill,
still they are cool, funny, loving brothers and we should be entertained.
I
liked the nonlinear storytelling, but what does it help with this stupid
story?
Even Defoe looks awful in such a dumb role with this senseless habits and
disgusting opinion.
Create a REALLY bad character, let him be executed and let people watch
it:
in fact, many of us are enjoying this, there is no other reason for black
and white hollywood.
No other reason for high ranking of &quot;The Boondock Saints&quot;
either.
At least, quite a BAD right-party propaganda movie.<br /><br />
