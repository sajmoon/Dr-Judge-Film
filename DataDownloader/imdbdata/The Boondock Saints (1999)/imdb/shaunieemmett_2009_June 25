This movie should be avoided at all costs. The acting is terrible, it
is so cheesy its ridiculous and the only reason Willem Dafoe took this
role was for the money because even he is terrible in it. The lead
roles have THE WORST Irish accents I have ever heard in a movie, they
sound like Leprechauns with Scottish, American, Australian and South
African twangs, absolutely cringeworthy. I was told that this was a
great movie and a cult classic. Oh my God please tell me this was a
joke. If Marlon Brando had used an African accent as Don Corleone in
The Godfather it would have been slated. This was a shambles of a movie
and the acting and script is terrible. If you think this movie is
anyway half decent then please pass me some of whatever you&#x27;re smoking,
because this is a disaster. 1 out of 10 only because I had to give a
mark.
