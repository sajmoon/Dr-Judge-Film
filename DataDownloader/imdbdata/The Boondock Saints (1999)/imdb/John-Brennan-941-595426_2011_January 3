Hi All, I don&#x27;t understand the reviews on this film? People are giving
it 10 out 0f 10!!!! How could you possibly do that? I bought this film
based on the reviews on here and I thought it was absolute garbage.
Garbage acting, garbage accents (I&#x27;m Irish, so know what a good accent
is), garbage story (As an Irishman, I know nobody or know of anyone who
speaks 5 languages. Russian is thought in about 2 schools in Ireland.
Both Private.) etc etc.<br /><br />The plot is fine and I get that. Vigalantebla, bla, bla, but C&#x27;mon!!!
The story is ridiculous and the only saving grace is Defoes comedy.<br /><br />Be Good JB
