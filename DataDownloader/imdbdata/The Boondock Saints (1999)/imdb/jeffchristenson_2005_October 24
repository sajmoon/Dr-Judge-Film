I won't attempt to argue the ethics of vigilantism. I would like to
point out that this movie did not pioneer the concept. Here is a short
list of films which have also touched on the idea. This is not nearly
all of them, but it's a highlight of the ones produced in English,
mostly in the USA, in the last 40 years.<br /><br />The Punisher, Batman, Spiderman, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, every
other comic book hero (give or take)<br /><br />[******The Dynamite Brothers (1974)*******<br /><br />&quot;Two brothers accomplished in the martial arts take on a vicious drug
lord.&quot; &lt;--- sound familiar?]<br /><br />Every movie ever made starring Steven Seagal, Charles Bronsen, or Clint
Eastwood. <br /><br />Taxi Driver, The Untouchables, The Annihilators, The Limey, The
Brotherhood of Justice, Falling Down, Road House, Home Alone, Home
Alone 2, Out for Blood, Outside the law, Above the Law, Extreme
Justice, Instant Justice, Street Justice, Streets of fire, Fighting
Back, Walking Tall, Body Count, Death Wish, Raw Deal, Next of Kin, Thou
Shalt Not Kill...Except, Vigilante, Urban Menace, DaVinci's War, El
Mariachi, Desperado, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, Lethal Weapon, Only
the Strong, When the Bullet Hits the Bone, Ms 45, Angel Town, Sin City,
Rush Hour<br /><br />I found almost nothing in this movie to be original. What was up with
&quot;Captain Highliner&quot; the F***ING fish stick killer? AKA &quot;The Ghost&quot;. Not
only does he reek of Sean Connery in &quot;The Rock&quot; (another movie you
could add to the list) but his tactics were Neanderthal, some expert
killer! He can't even ambush with a sniper rifle or ask the mafia for a
bomb. And what's up with that anyway, working for the mafia? Isn't he
one of the morally &quot;shit don't stink&quot;, &quot;chosen ones&quot;? He obviously
doesn't need much evidence to justify the killing of a &quot;bad person&quot;
because if he were a little more skilled then he'd have killed those
three idiots before having a chance to find out who they are or what
they've done.<br /><br />At least in &quot;The Rock&quot; Sean Connery was released from prison under the
authority of high ranking government officials. How does this movie
explain the release of said &quot;Ghost&quot;? That the mafia can have anyone
they want released from maximum security prison on a moments notice?
Well thought out, in fact bravo on no plot holes throughout the movie.<br /><br />The brother's little Latin Bible quote before shooting (only the main
target, who they were lucky wasn't taking careful aim on them as they
had to leave him to last) strikes me as a rip off of Samuel L Jackson
in Pulp Fiction. There are so many more direct and indirect rip offs I
won't bother mentioning them.<br /><br />OK so I'm gonna tackle vigilantism a little. If anyone is allowed to be
a vigilante, then each individual is left to decide if they are
intelligent, informed, and perceptive enough to judge who deserves to
die. Assuming we can agree that some people deserve to die for their
crimes there is still the issue that... STUPID PEOPLE MAKE BAD
DECISIONS AND WILL KILL THE WRONG PEOPLE!<br /><br />During a wave of publicity in Britain around year 2000 about
paedophiles, the public media reported these cases where vigilantes
took action against the wrong people. Likely there were other cases
which went unpublicized:-<br /><br />* A man with the same surname as a known paedophile in the same area.
(2 cases)<br /><br />* A man who lived in a house where a known paedophile lived before.<br /><br />* A paediatrician, because his job title starts with the same 4 letters
(3 letters in USA spelling), and uneducated confusion due to use of a
slang word &quot;paedo&quot; for &quot;paedophile&quot;.<br /><br />Then there is the issue of killing for God in a society that has many
different religions. Even if you adhere strictly to the ethics provided
by the Christian Bible, you may be committing crimes in the opinions of
the members of other religions. If one doesn't think that this is
important then they are inviting RELIGIOUS WAR! And it is the attitude
of vigilantism that propagates war around the world because any party
that has a crime committed against them feels justified in committing
crimes in retribution (Bush). The retribution is considered a crime by
the party it is committed upon, worthy of retribution. I think it's
easy to see that there can be only one end to such a cycle, do as Jesus
suggested and &quot;Turn the other cheek&quot;. It's an ancient concept that if
one lowers themselves to the level of what they consider wrong in order
to defeat that wrong, they will simply become part of that wrong.<br /><br />Then there is the small matter of a grey area. What about people that
have only committed 51% of the crimes needed to fully deserve death?
