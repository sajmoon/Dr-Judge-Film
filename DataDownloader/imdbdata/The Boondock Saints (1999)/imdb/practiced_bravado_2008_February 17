After reading so much about this cult classic, I was rather
underwhelmed after watching the pic for the first time. I bought the
Unrated Special Ed and viewed it last night. During my screening, I
quickly thought of Gary Fleder&#39;s &quot;Things To Do In Denver When You&#39;re
Dead&quot; which starred Andy Garcia, Chris Walken and Steve Buscemi. Both
films are quirky, tongue-in-cheek gangster flicks and yet the former
did not gain the cult following like Troy Duffy&#39;s violent, profane
thriller did. I even found Guy Ritchie&#39;s &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking
Barrels&quot; to be a more enjoyable and accomplished film.<br /><br />Yes, &quot;Saints&quot; does have style and a pulpy premise (twin brothers who
want to rid the world of evil), but I was expecting a lot more in terms
of execution. One of the disappointments for me came from the lack of
watching the brothers go to work. Their murders are shown as flashbacks
and I believe a wiser choice would&#39;ve been to depict them in &quot;real
time&quot;. More suspense and visceral thrills would&#39;ve been the result, at
least I think.<br /><br />In the end, I believe it lacks freshness. Not bad for a first time
director, but Duffy is an ego-maniac that seriously killed his own
career. So sadly, we won&#39;t see a second film from him that probably
would&#39;ve been even better. ** 1/2 stars out of ****.
