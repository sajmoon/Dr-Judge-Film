I just watched this movie for the first time and while it was not
anything spectacular i found it to be entertaining. Yes almost all the
action scenes were completely outrageous and unrealistic but that is
hardly something to be appalled at. How many times did you say &#x22;Oh Come
on!&#x22; when watching John McClain kill bad guy after bad guy non stop
with one gun and limited ammo, or Rambo slaying entire armies single
handed, and how about Dutch being the only one of many to kill the
predator with makeshift weapons while covered in mud. What pure action
film isn&#x27;t ridiculous and unbelievable. What surprises me is the hate
offered by people who disliked the movie. Take the people who write the
good reviews. They say what they thought of the movie and for the most
part leave it at that. But the people who write the bad reviews not
only trash the movie but deem anyone who liked it childish or just
plain idiots. Personally i find it childish and idiotic that these are
things such people are so bothered with. Look, its by no means a great
movie. But if you want to see some Irish boys defy all odds and kill
endless hoards of gangsters while saying the lords prayer, then this
movie is for you.
