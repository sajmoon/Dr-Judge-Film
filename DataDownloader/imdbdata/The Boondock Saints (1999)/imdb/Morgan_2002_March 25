This movie is an unintelligible piece of crap. The only reason I rented it
was because of the comparisons to Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs written
on
the box. Those are great movies, this one doesn't even approach being that
good. Don't waste your time. Oh, it does feature Ron Jeremy in a non-porno
role, if that interests you.
