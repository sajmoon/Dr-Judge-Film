This was a joke, right? <br /><br />This film starts off with some terrible exposition straight out of
Laverne &amp; Shirley (&quot;we've got to show the audience that these guys are
pals!&quot;), leading to some very melodramatic antics (the butch woman
kicking the guy square. Haha, funny!); then cuts to some ham-handed
characterization short-hand (the bar-tender with Tourette's....wha--?);
then the next day, we have a few 10th rate actor wanna-be's doing riffs
on every Tarantino/Boyle/Ritchie clich&eacute; in the book (all unmotivated
swearing and tough guy antics); then we have the DVD ejecting from my
player. <br /><br />Ten minute was enough.<br /><br />2/10 if the writer is over 18. 5/10 if he's still in high school (I'll
give him a break)
