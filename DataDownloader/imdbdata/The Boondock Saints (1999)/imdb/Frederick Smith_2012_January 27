Next to Johnny Depp, no one is known for the oddball roles better than
Willem Dafoe, and this one is no exception. Smecker is a great
detective, although his methods are a bit strange. When we first see
him he is well-dressed in a 4 button suit and flowing hair. He examines
the crime scene wearing latex gloves he retrieves from a pouch on his
belt after inserting the earplugs to his Walkman CD so he can listen to
opera while he carefully surveys the evidence. Sean Patrick Flanery and
Norman Reedus are excellent as a couple of meat packers who play jokes
on one another and their co-workers, are well liked and respected, and
obviously frugal Catholic boys who work and play hard. They live in a
loft in a commercial building in the Irish neighborhood where they live
a Spartan life, mattresses on the floor and not a television in sight.
The characters merge seamlessly to form a very basic and primitive
plot, one that gets under your skin, but there are some moments when
you have to wonder what exactly is going on. Not a film for the little
ones, or anyone who has a weak stomach when it comes to blood,
especially if you rent the Unrated Version. Unless you are into extreme
violence for the sake of violence, not a collectible, but worth seeing
if you are a fan of vigilante justice.
