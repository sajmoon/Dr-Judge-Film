Now, first off, this movie has a fantastic story that is about two
brothers who set out to rid their city of bad people like murderers and
perverts. This leads to a very good movie with a lot of great things
going for it. The movie has an interesting story, interesting if
somewhat exaggerated characters and great acting.<br /><br />Story-wise the movie is strong like in many other areas since it&#x27;s
creators wish to deliver a message, not to add another ton of gold-
bars to their golden money-palace. I love movies like this that has a
message to deliver and actually has a meaning, like the Godfather, V
for Vendetta, etc. An example of people who when they make a new movie
want to add another ton of gold-bars to their golden money-palace are
the creators of for example the embarrassingly bad Yes man.<br /><br />The movie also has great acting, yes I said it, live with it! Many
people complain about the acting but I just can&#x27;t see why and in my
opinion, it&#x27;s not the best acting, of course but it&#x27;s still great, the
actors really live into their roles, especially Willem Dafoe as the
homosexual cop pursuing the brothers. Except for one scene (THERE WAS A
FIREFIGTH!!) Willem&#x27;s acting was top-notch. The only one I felt really
wasn&#x27;t that great was Billy Connolly who still was good.<br /><br />Now one thing that is in my book a plus but for some people not is that
the movie is really violent and I mean REALLY, do -NOT- show this to
your children, the violence like in Saving Private Ryan gives a grim
and more realistic feel and has a great emotional impact when someone
important in the movie is killed. Another reason not to show this to
your kids is the language, the F-word is more often than you can
imagine, the movie is only 90 or 100 minutes long but there&#x27;s still
approximately 230-240 F-words and many minor profanities and a couple
of racial slurs. Now the profanity is not a plus in my book but the
dialog is, the dialog is masterly written and in a graphic movie like
this the frequent profanity fits in quite well so it&#x27;s absolutely not a
bad thing.<br /><br />Now if you can stomach the violence and profanity and brief nudity then
this is a real must-see, otherwise, get a few years older and watch it!
An amazing movie with a great story, a great message and great acting
(Yeah, I f**king said it) this is one of the best movies ever made and
a must-see for anyone who can!<br /><br />And please don&#x27;t judge this review just because I think that Yes man is
the worst movie ever made by far.
