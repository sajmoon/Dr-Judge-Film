To make this kind of movie the director need a sixth sense for balancing
violence, humor, popular culture and movie history. Unfortunately, Duffy
does not... Boondock Saints is simply a piece of unfocused, unflexible
speculation in the Godfather series, Tarantino and western genre. The
character stereotypes and film clich&eacute;s are stacked on top of each other
and
just mashed together to make a unforgettable impact - boredom!
