I watched this movie with a bunch of friends and I ended up being in the
minority.  I won't say the movie sucked but it wasn't good either.  I felt
that the movie lacked some much needed character development on the 2
brothers and the Willem Defoe character.  While watching the movie I was
secretly wishing for someone to kill off the 2 bland brothers so the movie
could end.  I'm all for violent, shoot'em up, curse filled movies but it
should be done with orignality and with interesting characters.  Yeah,
there
are some cool pretentious action sequences but thats basically all that
this
movie has to offer. The movie tried to be hip and cool with the brothers
reciting scripture just before they blow someone's head off but the only
person who could do that with any style and with coolness oozing out his
ears is bad ass Samuel L. Jackson.  This movie plays like a generic wannabe
of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.  The only redeeming quality this movie
has is the ending when the credits start rolling.
