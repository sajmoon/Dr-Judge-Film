I saw the high rating on the IMDB, read a few of the reviews, and decided to
add this to my DVD collection. As an independent film, I thought it might be
like Pulp Fiction, only a little more clever, a tad more insightful. <br /><br />Well, except for a few short moments with Willem Dafoe, it was largely
disappointing. It's just a low budget rip off of Pulp Fiction. I don't think
I was the only one to find David Della Rocco's character annoying in the Jar
Jar Binks sense of the word.
