The Boondock Saints has a lot of hype around it and after reading other
reviews i decided to buy a copy. It was really cheap so i decided it
would be worth it. But after about 20 minutes i found it to be just
another rip off of all American gun em down movies. I had high hopes as
i loved the idea of cleaning up the streets and possibly the world by
getting rid of the corrupt, scum and evil that plagues us but after
watching you can see how much this movie could be improved and the fact
you don't get a clear ending means i only would give this 6/10. Its
worth a rental but there are many more movies that are like this movie
and are much better in terms of acting, story and direction
