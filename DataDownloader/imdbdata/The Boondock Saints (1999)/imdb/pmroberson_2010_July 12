OK, let&#x27;s start with the obvious. As another reviewer aptly pointed
out, this is NOT _Pulp Fiction_, although it desperately wants to be.
With that out of the way, let&#x27;s hack this piece of crap apart bit by
bit:<br /><br />1. Willem Dafoe, who normally has my attention from Scene 1, overacts
enough to embarrass Jim Carrey in his Ace Ventura days. I think it was
direction rather than some weird intention of Dafoe to create a
singularly uninteresting and unbelievable gay FBI agent, but be that as
it may, it was awful.<br /><br />2. The plot. Booooooriing. Vigilantes killing bad people in interesting
ways? Wow, that wasn&#x27;t done in the 80s but every other movie.<br /><br />3. The self-aware cool factor. The brothers striding past the priest in
Mass (oh, in slow motion, it&#x27;s THAT cool), the inability of the
screenwriter to avoid F-bombs in every scene, including the ridiculous
self-control-losing &#x22;soliloquy&#x22; by Rocco, which contained nothing
except the F-word, the &#x22;Funny Man&#x22; racist joke (helllooo, _True
Romance_), the inane conversations about little things as Something Big
Was About To Go Down.<br /><br />4. The Russians. I&#x27;m pretty sure the director called up the folks who
did the voices of Boris and Natasha on _Bullwinkle_ and asked them how
to do a realistic portrayal of some Reds, and then ignored their advice
because it wasn&#x27;t stereotypical enough.<br /><br />5. The &#x22;real feel&#x22; achieved by interviewing &#x22;real&#x22; folks through the
closing credits. Well, that makes this piece of crap a relevant piece
of crap, doesn&#x27;t it? And now you know that it has REAL-WORLD
IMPLICATIONS. Because real people are really talking on real TV (not
really) about a real event that could, if it actually happened, be
real.<br /><br />In closing, may I recommend you skip this _Pulp Fiction_ wannabe and go
outside. Even if there&#x27;s a tornado, you&#x27;ll have a better time.
