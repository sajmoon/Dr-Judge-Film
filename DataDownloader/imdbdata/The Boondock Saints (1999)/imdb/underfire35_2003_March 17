THE BOONDOCK SAINTS is not so much a film, as a pastiche of better films.  There is not one single element of this production that has not been used before.  The writing copies Tarantino to the letter, the &quot;wiseguys&quot; are third rate Scorsese, the Il Duce character is swiped from LEON (&quot;no women, no kids&quot;), the twin brother angle is apparently stolen from THE KRAYS.  This film is overwrought with religious iconography (seemly only to add some depth to the shallow characters), pretentious without shame, amateurish, obvious, predictable, confusing and dull.  <br /><br />The director, Troy Duffy, steals ideas and set-ups from the following (in general, specifically when indicated):  Oliver Stone, Luc Besson (LEON), Gary Fleder (THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD), Peter Medak, Phil Joanou (STATE OF GRACE), Walter Hill, Sam Peckinpah, Antoine Fuqua, Michael Bay (THE ROCK), Michael Mann, Tony Scott, Ridley Scott, Alex Proyas (THE CROW), Robert Rodriguez, John Badham, Michael Winner (DEATH WISH), David Fincher, Guy Ritchie (his &quot;cool&quot; Irish films), Danny Cannon, Bryan Singer (USUAL SUSPECTS), the list goes on and on: Paul Verhoeven, Brian DePalma (THE UNTOUCHABLES), John Frakenhiemer, Quentin Tarantino (as director, PULP FICTION), David Mamet, James Ellroy (author), John Woo would be embarrassed with the amount of slow motion in this film.  This is just the short list of the most blatant instances
of plagiarism.  Duffy imitates the proven techniques of the above mentioned without understanding why they worked in the first place. He has made a carbon copy film of littered cliches and comes across as desperate to make a name for himself.<br /><br />I simply cannot understand the praise this film receives, it is a turgid mess.  The &quot;deep moral ramifications&quot; are transparent.  You have two guys running around murdering people in cold blood.  Has anyone noticed that most of the people they dispatch are unarmed and begging for their lives?  The statements that they make are completely ambiguous: if someone shoplifts they're okay, but if they are part of a shoplifting syndicate, they are marked for death?  What if they repent and never sin again?  How did this ever pass as real film-making?  <br /><br />The staged &quot;interviews&quot; under the closing credits only cements the plebian handling of this material.  It seems more like a cop-out really; Duffy did not want to admit that he has made a violent, sadistic, empty film simply for his own benefit, but why not?  Hollywood is awash with such films, he is only jumping on the band-wagon!  Good for him, at least he has found a place to call home.  All the fans of this film, do yourselves a favor (before you deify THE BOONDOCK SAINTS), review the work of those mentioned above and read Dostoyevsky's 'Crime and Punishment' to understand the taking of another human life from a more literate viewpoint.  0/10
