This film is terrible, one of the worst films I have ever seen. I can&#39;t
believe all the comments here praising it as an original action movie.
It plays more like a comedy than action, the acting is terrible, what
is the story with the shitty Irish accents I&#39;m Irish and I don&#39;t know
anyone who sounds like that and anyway as far as I know they have been
living there all their lives, so would they not have American accents?.
The only positive that I took away from this film was David Del
Rocko(the only intentionally funny person in the film). Please would
someone tell me what was going on with William Defoe&#39;s character what a
weird man how many cops go prancing around crime scenes the way he
does. Terrible.<br /><br />DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM
