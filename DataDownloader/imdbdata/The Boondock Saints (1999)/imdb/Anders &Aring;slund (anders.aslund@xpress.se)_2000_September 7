An entertaining movie without any real substance. Extremely violent and
somewhat dumb, the Boondock Saints don't push any boundaries that Pulp
Fiction hasn't done, but aspires to do so. It fails, but is nevertheless
entertaining.<br /><br />And it is WEIRD. Despite the fact that the FBI agent is WAY too strange to
have ever passed the psyche profile to become and agent, he is funny and
chilling. It's hard to say if he's a bad guy or a good guy. But listening to
opera while doing an investigation feels kind of unnecessary and
silly.
