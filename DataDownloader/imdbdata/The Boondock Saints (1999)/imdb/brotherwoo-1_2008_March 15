Terribly overrated. Lots of stolen ideas of movies such as Pulp
Fiction, Things to Do in Denver When You&#39;re Dead, James Elmore Novels,
etc. Quoting scripture ala Jules from Pulp Fiction. Accidental shooting
of the cat, also reminiscent of Pulp Fiction. The tone of the movie was
confused: was this a serious movie or a comedy or a tragedy? Defoe and
Della Rocco&#39;s characters are absurdly overacted, almost to an
embarrassing extent. Lots of &quot;cool&quot; posturing. The director took pains
to make a couple very normal acting Irish kids look a lot more hip than
they really were. This movie was just bad. The lead comment in which
this film was rated 10 stars mentioned that even if you are a Christian
you should still watch this movie. How silly: as if only Christians
would be offended by the banality of gore?
