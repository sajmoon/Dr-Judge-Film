This had to be one of the most unethical movies I&#39;ve ever seen. The
best movies are the ones that make you think about about their message
afterward (debate over the premises and conclusion) or the movies that
tell their story in a captivating way; Boondock Saints did none of
that. It was built up to be just like a Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs
but it doesn&#39;t come close to those two classics. This movie&#39;s
underlying message, if universalized, is &quot;anyone who is perceived as
bad should be killed in the name of God&quot;; seems to be the same logic
that any terrorist would use. It&#39;s sick to think that people condone
the killing that occurs in this movie. A person may try to argue that
any superhero acts in this way but a spiderman, batman, or superman all
help people that need it at that time; they also never execute people.
