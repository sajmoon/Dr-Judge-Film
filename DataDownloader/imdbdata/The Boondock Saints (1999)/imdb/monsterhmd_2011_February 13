I admit, 10 out of 10 may be a bit extreme, but this movie was by far
one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. There&#x27;s enough
suspense, action, and comedy to thoroughly satisfy anyone watching
it.... not to mention the two exceedingly attractive lead actors.
Shallowness beside, the very concept of the movie was amazing. It&#x27;s not
just one of those movies about mindless and graphic violence, it has a
clear MESSAGE that&#x27;s plainly beautiful to everyone, even those who
don&#x27;t agree with the message. The filming techniques, too, with the
style of flashbacks, creates a thrilling movie experience overall. The
whole thing is rounded off quite nicely with the actors, NOT just
because Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery are so attractive, but
because every single actor in this movie is genuinely good at what they
do. If I had one hundred hands, I would give this movie one hundred
thumbs up.
