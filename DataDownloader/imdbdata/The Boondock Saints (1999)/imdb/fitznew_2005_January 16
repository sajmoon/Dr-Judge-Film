This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies of all time! I have no idea
how &quot;Boondock Saints&quot; ever got produced, but it makes me believe that
getting a film made in this country isn't about talent, or a good
script, or decent acting or directing, but rather, who you meet or
know. It blows my mind that there is actually the possibility of a
sequel being produced!! If I was stuck on a desert island with only
this movie and nothing else to do, I would go drown myself! After you
watch the first five minutes of this &quot;movie,&quot; trust your instincts that
tell you to stop what you're doing and go do anything else! You don't
have to know much about movies or have much taste to realize that a
five-year-old could do a better job with a home camera. I can't imagine
how or why so many people could rate this well on IMDb, but it makes me
reluctant to ever trust these ratings again.
