In fact the movie should have been good. It had a good soul. It had a
good idea in two underdogs against the Mafia. We even had a semi super
star in Dafoe, certainly one with great charisma. In fact, the leading
actors all had great charisma. This would have been an epic film in the
hands of someone who would just emulate de Mille a little.<br /><br />But Troy Duffy did absolutely everything horrible. Talk about the
opposite of de Mille, and that&#x27;s why it flounders.<br /><br />We begin with the worst music score since &#x22;A View to a Kill&#x22;. The music
is one horrible clich&#xE9; after another, and makes you wonder if it is a
comedy. If so, it fails. Duffy never commits to either comedy or
action, and that&#x27;s okay, as long as you know how to inter-splice comic
relief. You don&#x27;t have to follow the Shakespeare formula as closely as
the old great directors and writers, but you have to at least be
coherent.<br /><br />This movie lacks any coherence, in every way.<br /><br />It is a botched job of directing. We could blame the editing, but the
editing is so consistently pathetic, we have to admit it is the
director&#x27;s hand in this. When you have to have a scorecard telling you
what is going on, when you have to have a TV set at the stadium to see
the ball game, when you have to sneak in your own refreshments, when
the fans are mumbling and making unintelligible sounds that give you
absolutely no clue as to what is going on, there is no reason to go to
the stadium.<br /><br />The movie drags at a horribly modern pace, too. Again, these
incompetent directors need to learn from the masters like de Mille and
Ford, directors who knew how to keep your interest, who could keep the
flow going.<br /><br />There is no way a person can watch this without fast forwarding. It
can&#x27;t be done by someone not on serious drugs. If I was a narcotics
officer, I would immediately arrest any one who I witnessed watching
this all the way through, because drugs would be GUARANTEED to be found
in their system. Of course I couldn&#x27;t sit and watch a drug crazed
zombie watch it all the way through.<br /><br />And it really is too bad. This should have been a good movie. It had
all the promise. If only Duffy didn&#x27;t believe in modern clich&#xE9;s so
much, if only a real director and writer could have done this.
