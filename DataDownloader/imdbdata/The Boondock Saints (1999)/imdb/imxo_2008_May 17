Boondock Saints is a movie with one or two original ideas and lots and
lots of stolen ones. Ultimately, it&#39;s just a violent, pretentious,
idiotic rip-off of a movie. Even the title of this movie is stupid.
Whoever heard of one boondock?<br /><br />After viewing this movie I&#39;m starting to understand why Italians are so
incensed about the stereotypes of Italians in all those Mafia movies.
In the same way, Boondock Saints will certainly not do much for the
Boston Irish - or even for the Irish Irish.<br /><br />I thought the carpet chewing performance of David Della Rocco was the
only good performance in the film. The other actors were just
wallpaper, and Willem Dafoe was positively annoying. The writing, too,
is extraordinarily bad. At one point Dafoe sends a cop out to buy him a
&quot;latte with a twist of lemon.&quot; Coffee with milk and lemon must be an
acquired taste, which is exactly what would have to happen to be able
to appreciate the tripe in this movie.
