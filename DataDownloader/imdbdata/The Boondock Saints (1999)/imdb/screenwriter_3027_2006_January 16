This movie is not good. It is poorly acted, and it makes very little
sense. The plot isn't coherent at all, and is really just an excuse to
show Irish people cussing at another. The character &quot;Rock&quot; is annoying
as hell, and none of the characters are really likable. Willem Dafoe is
wasted as a homosexual cop. The only decent part of the movie is the
end, which I won't spoil. Just save to say the monologue is so poorly
delivered I was actually laughing. Screw this movie, it's not as good
as everyone says it is. The only reason it has such a good rep is
because a bunch of geeks decided it qualified as entertainment. Don't
see this, it's disappointing.
