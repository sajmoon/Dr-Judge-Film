I haven't seen this show since it was canceled back in `97 but I used to
love this show! It was hilarious! I remember when I was a kid and this show
was perhaps my favorite. Also I'm going to be honest and say that Jefferson
was better than Steve. I know that it took a long time before people began
to like Jefferson but Jefferson was cool because he was a great partner to
Al. While Steve was a great partner to Marcy. Anyway, this show was funny
during it's entire 10 year, 11 season run. Ed O`Neil was hilarious as Al,
Peg was lazy, funny, and at times sexy, Kelly was always sexy and at times
funny, Bud was a character you would pity and laugh to at the same time,
Marcy was a great &quot;enemy&quot; to Al, and Jefferson was a great
partner.<br /><br />No Ma'am was hilarious!
Buck was funny and Lucky wasn't and Steve needed a lot of improvement but he
was still funny.
