This show was the best sitcom ever!  I do think the people at FOX made a
huge mistake by canceling them in 1997.  I understand that all good things
must come to an end but compared to some of the things that are on network
television today there will never be another show like Married with Children
again.  Thank god for FX on cable and satellite.
