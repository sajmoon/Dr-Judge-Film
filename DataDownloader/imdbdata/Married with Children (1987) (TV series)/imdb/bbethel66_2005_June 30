Married with Children was one of the more entertaining comedies of the
1990's. It's the usual scenario of a financially troubled white family
that somehow manages to stick together with all its eccentricity.<br /><br />I only regret not being able to tune into this show sooner. It has
great characters, sharp stories, and excellent humor. It features the
goofy, desperate husband/father, Al Bundy, the lazy, carefree wife,
Peggy Bundy, the hilariously clueless daughter, Kelly Bundy, the
continuously perverted Bud Bundy, and the witty dog, Buck.<br /><br />Married with Children has made a few mistakes that many shows make,
including the addition of the &quot;new kid&quot;. The &quot;new kid&quot;, in this case,
Seven, only exists to steal the main casts' thunder. Luckily, the show
got rid the pesky &quot;new kid&quot;, something that many other shows NEVER do
(My Wife and Kids, The Brady Bunch, The Cosby Show).<br /><br />In spite of its few flaws, Married with Children is still a fine
example of what's missing in comedies today. The cast and crew did a
lot of what it took to bring the characters to life, and it became a
little more than a run-of-the-mill family show.<br /><br />Fortunately, repeats can still be seen on FX, and are also available on
DVD.
