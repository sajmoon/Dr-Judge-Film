I don't know where to start on Married...With Children so I'll just say
that
they're the ultimate TV family and, after the Simpsons, the funniest. Who
can forget the the legendary insulting bouts between Al and Peg, Bud and
Kelly and Al and Marcy, those never fail to get a rise out of me. Al and
Bud
were probably my favorite characters. I love how irritable Al is with the
fat women at the shoe store and how Bud always tries to get laid. I was
angry when this show was cancelled but I always watch the reruns on FX
every
night. This show is a classic. 10/10
