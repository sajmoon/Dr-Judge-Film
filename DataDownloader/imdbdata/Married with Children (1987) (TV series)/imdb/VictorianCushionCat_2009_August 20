I must confess to being a big fan of the British style of comedy, the
losers in life, the people that we can laugh at and think &#x27;thank god my
life&#x27;s not as bad as that&#x27; So many American comedies really do pass me
by, the characters being too rich, glamorous, fortunate, moral,
pleasant, popular and eager to do the right thing to ever be truly
funny enough.<br /><br />After all, what is so funny if everyone is in on the joke? Surely it&#x27;s
far better if the characters of a comedy are victims of their
situation, and this is why I loved &#x27;Married with Children&#x27; Here was an
American Family sitcom, that unticked all the boxes of syrupy 1980s
American Family sitcoms.<br /><br />Al Bundy is a legend for starters, his drained, resigned look as he
comes through his front door after a horrific day at work, knowing no
nice meal will be on the table, and what little cash he has, will be
swiped by his lazy, uncaring wife Peggy.<br /><br />The kids too, Kelly is an airhead who attracts into the house a
stunning variety of knuckle scrapers, Bud is pretty smart, but trapped
inside &#x27;the Bundy curse&#x27;.<br /><br />And what genius having stuck-up political correct but ultimately tragic
Marcy next door, thing could only get worse for her being next door to
nemesis Al, and they did when she married a man with the surname,
D&#x27;arcy.<br /><br />A crackingly funny show with plenty of non-PC jokes, refreshingly trash
family, and perhaps best of all, the lovely Christina Applegate.
