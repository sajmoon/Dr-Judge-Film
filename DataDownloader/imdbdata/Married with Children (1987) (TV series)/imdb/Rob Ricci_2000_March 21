2000_March 21 

I've read the comments and looks like we all like MWC.  I stayed with the
show through thick and thin.  There were a few years when the writing went
downhill, but it came back up during the last 2 or 3 years of the show's
run.<br /><br />Anyway, my favorite episode HAS to be the one concerning the Barbie doll.
The scene where Al is stuck in bed with Marcy is a CLASSIC (much like the
scene in All In The Family where Archie's neice goes out with Lionel, the
black neighbor) and when Jefferson comes in and forces Al out the window
is
nothing short of hilarious.  My eyes are filling up with tears of laughter
thinking of that scene.<br /><br />Now for a few unforgettable lines I like:<br /><br />the episode where the Dodge turns over to 1,000,000 miles:
Al turns on the radio and a cowboy is singing &quot;And that's when my hound
dog,
started looking good to me&quot;<br /><br />I forget what episode this was in, but Bud kicks his family out so he can
study.  He says to Buck the dog, &quot;looks like it's just you and me&quot;.  Bucks
says to himself:  &quot;Uh oh.  I've seen porno movies that start out like
this.&quot;<br /><br />I had an idea for a storyline:  Al's favorite strip club, The Nudie Bar,
is
burned down.  Was it accidental or was it set by Marcy &quot;Chicken Legs&quot;
Darcy
and her anti-male friends?<br /><br />What do you think of that plot?  Could it have worked?<br /><br />I almost submitted this without saying which of Marcy's husbands I liked
better.  I like Steve just a little bit better.  He had that straight face
that never cracked a smile no matter how ridiculous Al got.  Jefferson was
goo too, don't get me wrong.
