When this show came out, the times sure were a changin&#x27;! Shows like
&#x22;Married With Children&#x22; and &#x22;Roseanne&#x22; were a far cry from &#x22;Andy
Griffith&#x22; and &#x22;The Brady Bunch&#x22;. How times change for the worse!
Basically the format changed sometime in the late 80&#x27;s to where it was
decided that low class, insulting, embarrassing garbage would be the
type of TV shows created and aired, and apparently there was an
audience for it. Make it and they will come. Tells you a lot about
society, doesn&#x27;t it? Repetitive, low class garbage gets old VERY fast,
as does this show. It was junk shows like this which set the stage for
the trash that&#x27;s on TV today. No wonder people have no respect for
themselves or others.
