Married With Children is absurd and unbelievable,which is why it&#39;s so
damn good.The situations are innovative and the family is hilarious
mostly because they all can&#39;t stand each other.Al Bundy is definitely
the classic character spawned from this show.He&#39;s a
sexist,gross,primitive,rude,obnoxious,prick and is funny as hell.Peggy
is a lazy,mooching housewife who always wants something but is never
willing to earn it herself.Kelly is a trashy,slutty,rebellious teen who
is only concerned about popularity,and dates.Budd is a
blackmailing,sneaky,loser who is all hormones and greed.The family is
so ridiculous but so funny.This show is intelligent,witty,and all and
all raunchy.Married With Children is no doubt a classic sitcom.It&#39;s The
Osbournes before The Osbournes.
