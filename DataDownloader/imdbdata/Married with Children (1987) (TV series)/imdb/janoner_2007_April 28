I turned this on randomly and felt so compelled by hate of this program
that I signed on to IMDb and made a comment. Maybe it&#39;s a great thing
for Middle America but this is below anything deserving of English TV.
I&#39;d prefer watching teletext than this. I can&#39;t believe that this is
really the level of humour that America is at. The fresh prince was
miles ahead years ago and thats was crap then. I&#39;m shocked that it has
such a high rating. The production levels are appalling. I&#39;m surprised
I don&#39;t see a boom in the shot and maybe a bit of dribble coming out
the actors inane babble. I&#39;m not of the era of &#39;I love Lucy&#39; but
considering it&#39;s 50 years on I&#39;d expect more from the most influential
country in the world. <br /><br />Even in tongue and cheek this is sadly lacking in every possible way.
