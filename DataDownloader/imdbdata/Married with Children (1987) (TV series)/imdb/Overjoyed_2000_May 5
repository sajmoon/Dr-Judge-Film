I am a big fan of Married With Children and have been getting reacquainted
with the Bundy's thru syndicated airings on the FX Channel. This show
lasted
10 years, so I won't even have to tell you how good it was. I don't find
this as the funniest series of all time. But at the same time, I have found
particular episodes to be some of the funniest in the history of
television.
If you ever see the episode where Bud Bundy has an affair with his teacher,
you're going to be on the floor rolling with laughter.
