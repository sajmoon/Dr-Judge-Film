This show raised a generation! People say it got more stupid in the last
year or two, but I believe it was good all the way through, except maybe
the
first 3 seasons, they were a bit off, but still all right. This show, no
matter how much you may disapprove of it was entertaining, I even caught my
grandparents watching it!
