<br /><br />I'm sorry but a show with such crude humour..
I am surprised it lasted as long as it did.
They should have ditched it during the pilot showings.
I remember when i was a kid waching it yea i laughed I laughed at the crap
I
didnt understand.  They say Beavis and BUtthead is bad... they have no
taste..
