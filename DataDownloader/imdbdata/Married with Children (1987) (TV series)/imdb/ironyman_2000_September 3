For me the series really took off after the first season. ONE of the best
(one of way too many)lines I'll never forget comes from Al, in a
&quot;father/Son&quot; talk with Bud (Lemonade/ Lost Jacket episode): &quot;Son. Your
tired....Your cold....Your hungry. You made a quarter today. And then the
women took it away from you! Congratulations son! Today you had finally
learned what it is to be a man!&quot;<br /><br />I loved any episode with any kind of money-wife-girlfriend money theme to
it. <br /><br />Al, the working class schmuck.
Peg, the lazy, manipulative liar of a wife.
Kelly, the sexy free loader of a daughter.
Bud, the loser son.
Marcy, the up tight politically correct neighbor.
Jefferson, the smartest one of the lot!<br /><br />I loved them all!
