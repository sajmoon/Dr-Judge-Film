Without a doubt this was the funniest TV show ever, it seems as if though
ever episode made me laugh a little harder. Now you can view the reruns on
the FX cable network channel, Fox's Married With Children portrayed the
basic American family. To describe there's Al Bundy (Ed O' Neill) as the
lazy obnoxious having to earn your living shoe salesman and support your
entire family in the process. Peggy Bundy (Katey Sagal) as your TV obsessed
lazy house wife spending her husband's earnings. Kelly Bundy (Christina
Applegate) as your typical stupid, but beautiful blond all sex and beauty,
but no brains. Bud Bundy (David Faustino) as the horny never getting any
woman chaser, but yet the brains of the family no brawn and all brain. Then
the D'Arcy's Marcy (Amanda Bearse) the nosey gossiping sexy rude next door
neighbor wife with the hunk of a husband the prissy lazy unemployed
Jefferson (Ted McGinley). To sum it up there is not a person in America who
doesn't know people and families who are just like the Married With Children
characters.The characters portray American life so well in a funny way, and
the show has some the better sex jokes ever. Everyone can relate to the
Bundy's attitudes and way of life. The only difference from that of real
life the show does it in such a comical way. Great show one of the best ever
I rate this 10 out of 10.
