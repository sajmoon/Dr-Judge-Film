love it <br /><br />well this is brilliant to sum it up in a little sentence this is like
the Simpsons bought to life <br /><br />you can see it again and again and still find it funny , a set show
about the average poor American <br /><br />the character are great , the way its made its like watching a cartoon <br /><br />this is one of the best comedy series ever made , there are so many
jokes and the plots are silly yet entertaining <br /><br />all you need to do is see one episode to be converted to know that this
is genius
