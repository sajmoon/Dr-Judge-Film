Married With Children is the greatest comedy sitcom of all time, I hear
lots
of good talk about Friends, Frasier, or all these new shows that are coming
on, but Married With Children is by far the best comedy of all time, this
is
the only show where I like every single character and Al and Marcy
insulting
each other is the funniest stuff you'll ever hear on tv, if you've never
seen this show then you've never truly laughed!
