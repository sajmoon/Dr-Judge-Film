One of my favorite shows as a kid revolved around Al Bundy, a
misogynistic slob who forever fondly remembered his glory days while
hating the hell that was his life now. Married to an ungrateful
money-hungry, sex-stared nag of a wife, Peg, and his selfish kids: the
dorky sex-hungry Bug and the bombshell but borderline mentally retarded
Kelly. I tuned in week in and week out, enamored by the family's
constant put-downs of each other and everyone else. I loved the crass,
juvenile humor. And you know what? I STILL do!! It's such a timeless
great piece of trash. Yea the jokes are always the same (jokes on
fatties, Al's job, Peg's lack of sex, Kelly being an idiot, etcetera),
but who cares? those jokes are endlessly funny. When Seven joined the
cast the laughter died down quite a bit. They had the sensibility to
give the brat the heave ho but it was never the same afterwords.<br /><br />My Grade: A
