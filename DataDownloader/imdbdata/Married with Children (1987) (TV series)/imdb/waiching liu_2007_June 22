This was and still is one of the most funniest-yet at times offensive
sitcoms that came out of America. It wasn&#39;t as offensive as say South
Park, but more in line with Family Guy. Let&#39;s face it, if it wasn&#39;t for
Married With Children, then Family Guy would never have existed in the
first place. The Bundy&#39;s may have been a family of &#39;losers&#39; but their
antics were often so stupid and yet had me howling and laughing still.
The humour is very un- PC, the female characters on Married With
Children are either attractive looking-yet lame-brained air-heads or
men-hating feminists.<br /><br />As a female myself, i actually thought it was so hilarious because
really, with a sitcom you&#39;re not supposed to take everything that
occurs in the show and what the characters say so seriously anyway. Al
is so funny what with his &#39;cheap&#39; shots aimed at Marcy Darcy, Peggy is
sweet and yet so goody goody, Bud thinks just like his father Al, and
Kelly is a stereotypical &#39;dumb blonde&#39;. Marcy and Jefferson are also
great characters- they too maintain the flow of the plot and their role
in the show as the Bundy&#39;s neighbours, is just as central to the show
as the family members themselves.<br /><br />Married with Chlldren is a laugh-out-loud, riotous un-PC fest. It may
not be everyone&#39;s cup of tea, but when it is as funny as it is, you
cannot help but fall for this show. Just excellent!
