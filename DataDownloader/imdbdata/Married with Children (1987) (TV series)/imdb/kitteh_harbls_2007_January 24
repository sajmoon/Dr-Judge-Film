It&#x27;s hard not to fall in love with this show. It&#x27;s not terribly deep,
yet still there&#x27;s something about it. The main reason is because the
characters are pretty entertaining:<br /><br />* Al Bundy: politically incorrect, &#x22;sexist&#x22; (so to speak), bitter, he&#x27;s
the lovable dad. But not lovable in the same sense Peter Griffin and
Homer Simpson are lovable (fat, dumb &#x26; nice), Al is actually fit,
fairly intelligence and rude at times. But that&#x27;s why we love him: he&#x27;s
not rude because of a sinister intent, he&#x27;s rude because his life is
screwed up enough to kill any desire he might have to be polite or
diplomatic. And why wouldn&#x27;t he be so bitter? He&#x27;s in his 40&#x27;s, he&#x27;s a
shoe salesman in a forsaken mall, his pay is next to nothing (worse
yet, he gets paid in Pesos), he has a lazy, useless, nagging wife who
always puts him down, a viciously stupid blonde daughter who&#x27;s
promiscuous and nearly proud about it, his son is smart but he&#x27;s kinda
short and is a miserable failure in his love life, yet the son is
always confident in his abilities to get girls. Not only that, but he
seems to have the worst luck in the world. He just can&#x27;t get a damn
break. To top it all off, his neighbors annoy the hell out of him. Al
is revered and loved by every guy on Earth, and loathed and feared by
every woman.<br /><br />* Peggy Bundy: enormous red hair, constantly-worn high heels (causing
her to walk funny), super lazy, can&#x27;t cook, can&#x27;t do dishes, can&#x27;t do
laundry, can&#x27;t do anything at all. Or doesn&#x27;t want to. Either way, her
main hobby (other than sitting in front of the TV all day watching
Opera and Soap Operas) is to put Al Down about his lousy job, laughable
income, crappy car and miserable life. Al is always down on himself and
fed up with life, so he doesn&#x27;t have time for her, thus she&#x27;s almost
always in heat. But Al does not desire women anymore (well, not the
ones who are married to him, at least), so he always finds ways to
circumvent those requests of hers, even though Peggy *is* one helluva
gal: sexy, fit and beautiful.<br /><br />* Kelly Bundy: a legendary TV character, Kelly is worshiped by guys all
over the world. She&#x27;s the epitome of sexiness: glaringly bright blonde
hair that flows like a platinum-gold waterfall, a curvy, staggeringly
sculpted body, creamy-white, silky skin, and killer legs, topping it
all off with an angelically beautiful face of luscious red lips,
dazzling white teeth with a cute little gap in the front and
mesmerizing eyes. Kelly (played by Christina Applegate) is the dream of
every guy, every age, any taste. Despite her physical credentials,
she&#x27;s horribly stupid, to much of the agony of her dad, seeing how her
idiocy comes at the worst possible times (she was a witness once for
her dad). One of the reasons to watch the show. Of course, many other
shows have had (and will continue to have) characters that might come
close, but there will always be one Christiana Applegate. Those who saw
Christina only in recent work (Anchorman, etc.) will be shocked to see
how even MUCH sexier she was back then. Cracks non-stop jokes about her
brother&#x27;s lousy love life and bad skin.<br /><br />* Bud: cracks non-stop jokes at his sister&#x27;s promiscuity. He&#x27;d joke
about her stupidity too, but doesn&#x27;t, knowing she won&#x27;t get them. Bud
is pretty damn funny with sarcastic comments and endless trainwreck
relationships.<br /><br />The interaction of these characters, the situations they put themselves
in, the crap that life throws at Al, all reasons to get addicted to the
show. I still watch reruns and taped episodes. <br /><br />The one big flaw of this show came later on: the audience. The laughter
is alright, but they applauded EVERY character, EVERY episode. Every
time a character walks in, they applaud. It&#x27;s a waste of time. First it
was Al and Kelly (which is just fine by me, I still applaud them every
time), then it extended to the rest of the family, THEN the neighbors
(Steve and Marcy, then Marcy and D&#x27;arcy). It was pretty damn annoying.
Another smaller annoyance is &#x27;talking&#x27; for Buck the dog. WTF? The human
characters are fine, thank you very much. But those are more annoyances
than they are problems. Four words sum up this show: thoroughly
enjoyable, hopelessly addictive. You&#x27;ll fall in love with this show in
no time.
