I've seen a lot of Comedy's come and go and I must say, although Married was
a bit exaggerated and had a lot of dumb humor it was the best of it's kind.
That's probably the reason there even turned up a clone of it (Unhappily
ever after). The Bundy's were good up until 90 or so, the seasons 90 and 91
or so were supreme (I mean the season in which for example Al got
circumcised). After that it lost appeal and then regained it in 95 to 96
when the shows were good to my surprise although Buck 'left'. I liked a few
of that episodes very much. After that it was back to normal and it needed
to be cancelled. It got old and repetitive. Still a show to watch and one
that made history while deserving it.
