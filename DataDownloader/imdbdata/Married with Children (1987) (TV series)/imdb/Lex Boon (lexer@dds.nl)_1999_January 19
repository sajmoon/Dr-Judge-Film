I think Married with Children is the best comedy after Gilligan's Island.
It's an ordinary family, they are all ugly, Bud, AL the Red Monster
(Peggy) Accept Kelly! Kelly is great. In Married with Children she is the
stupid one. She have a lot boyfriends, but what do you expect with that
body. Jefferson is also great!!!!!!
