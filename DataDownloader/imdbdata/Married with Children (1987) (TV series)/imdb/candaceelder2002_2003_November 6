While everyone is adulating the way overhyped Malcolm in the Middle as &quot;A
Live Action Simpsons&quot;, I'd like to give the title to Married...With
Children, even though this show came out before the Simpsons did. I don't
want to repeat all the good reviews here, but I just want to say, this
show
was so cool and yes, very, very bawdy, but they combined bawdiness with
social commentary like on South Park, Duckman, and The Simpsons (before
season 10). Other shows today just slop over with so much bawdiness that
the
social commentary is blurred. We need more shows like Married With
Children!
