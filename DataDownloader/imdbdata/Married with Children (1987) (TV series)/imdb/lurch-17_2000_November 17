The best sitcom ever.  When I saw the first episode in 1987 I knew it would
be a winner.  In that episode, the Bundys met the Rhodes, Bud (very young)
called Kelly a &quot;bimbo&quot;, Peg trashed Al's coffee so he would take her to a
restaurant, PC Marcy dominated Steve, and Al responded to Steve's question
&quot;Where are your kids?&quot; with &quot;I dunno&quot;.  I did not stop
laughing.<br /><br />This is the only TV show where everyone always said exactly what they felt
like saying, and that was the secret to its success.  Every character was
perfectly cast.<br /><br />The two best episodes:  'Auntie's Ashes' and the 'Roof Leak'.  The slapstick
with dummies flying around, Al punching out Kelly's boyfriends, Salt Water,
Miranda de la Jolly ....., Griff, Officer Dan were all
perfect.<br /><br />Look for Traci Lords, Tim Conway, Ed Byrnes, Wolfman Jack, Terry Bradshaw,
Joe Namath, Pauly Shore, and on and on.<br /><br />It broke me up for ten years.  I sure miss it, especially the early episodes
they never re-run.  <br /><br />Definitely not for the PC.  This show gores everyone's ox, no one is sacred
or righteous.  Don't miss it if you love pointed comedy.
