This is the story of Bundys. The Bundys are a chaotic white trash
family. They live in a one-family house in Chicago. Al is married to
Peggy for years. They have two children: Kelly and her younger brother
Bud. They also have a dog. The Bundys live next to Marcy and her
husband. Ostensibly the Bundys don&#39;t really like each other, but they
will always stay together, or as Al says: &quot;Love, hate, look, we&#39;re a
family, what&#39;s the difference?&quot; (episode 501). Their life is dominated
by failure, but their lives go on, or as Al says: &quot;Bundys are losers,
not quitters&quot; (episode 708). Peggy and the kids blame their miserable
life to Al. Therefore Peggy asks Bud &amp; Kelly to thank their father in
an ironic way if something bad happens, and they go &quot;thanks Dad&quot;. But
the Bundys also enjoy each other&#39;s failures. However, they also have
joyful moments where they like to do the Bundy cheer. Their family car
is an early 70s Dodge.
