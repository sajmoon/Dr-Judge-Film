i love this show!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i think its really funny, all cast are great.
i couldn't think of any 1 better to play this role.
all i have to say is what is wrong with you people?????
i know that it was cancelled on fox on 1997 but you can still see married
with children being played on the paramount comedy channel on cable or sky
at 8:00 pm on weekdays and weekends
see, it hasn't ended yet
i havn't seen the new episodes yet but i am looking forward to seeing them
and know that they will be good
