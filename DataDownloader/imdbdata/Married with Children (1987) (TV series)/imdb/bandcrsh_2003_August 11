This is the greatest show on television, my favorite character is the
red-haired housewife(Peggy), and all she does is eat bon-bons and watch
Oprah, Al and his &quot;amigos&quot; go to The Jiggly Room(a nudie bar) and watch &quot;the
girlies dance in their underpants&quot;. I give this show **********out
of**********.
