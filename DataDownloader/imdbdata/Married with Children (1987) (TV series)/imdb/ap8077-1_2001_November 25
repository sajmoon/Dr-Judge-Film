This is one of my top five shows of all time. I love kelly and buck they was
so funny but to bad they stop airing the show. But I dont understand how can
they have a nice house like that and not a nice job. I wish I had a house
like that. So if you want to see this show you can catch it  all day long on
cable because this is the best show of all time.
