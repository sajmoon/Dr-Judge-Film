Married...with Children is on the TOP of my favorite list. I've got every
episode ever shown on TV, except for the one that was never aired. The
episode was considered too raunchy for TV for that era. (If the critics back
then knew what was on today).
I believe the episode was about Al &amp; Peg and maybe Steve and Marcy
going to a motel for their second honeymoon, not knowing that the motel
operator had a video camera hidden in the honeymoon suite.
Also have every issue of Married...with Children comics that was
published . Guess I'm hooked.
