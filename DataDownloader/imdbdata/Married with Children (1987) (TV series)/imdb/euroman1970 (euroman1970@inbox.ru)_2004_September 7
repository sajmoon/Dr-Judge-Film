&quot;Married... with Children&quot; in my opinion is the best TV series ever
created.<br /><br />A breakthrough show for its time, it emphasized on a family life of Al
Bundy, the hapless shoe salesman, his wife, Peggy Bundy, lazy, couch
sitting, Oprah watching, no cleaning or cooking wife, and their two
teenage children - Bud, smarty pants with no social life, and Kelly,
brainless blonde. While most of the shows in the 80's were of good
moral standards, &quot;Married...&quot; was the opposite. Al and Peg have been
married for such a long time that they no longer wanted to do anything
with each other. To contrast their relationship, we have Mr. and Mrs.
Rhoades. They are newlyweds and, of course, still have feelings for
each other. As series progressed, some cast members left, others joined
the show. Some episodes were hilarious while others seemed less
interesting. During the last 2 years or so, &quot;Married...&quot; had new
writers, and I felt it, the show kept loosing its steam, the jokes
became repeatatives and not very funny. The show ran from 1987 until
its abrupt end in 1997. I wish they made a true ending to the show,
there are so many unanswered questions... I would have loved to see Al
finally hitting a lotto and moving to an island with several beautiful
women that catered to his every need. I can come up with many different
endings... I felt betrayed just like the cast themselves. I am sure
many fans of the show would agree with me. More than 250 episodes were
made and they still make me laugh every time I watch the reruns; and
since I got married I understand much clearer all the frustrations Al
was going through.<br /><br />The show paved the way for more outrageous comedies such as &quot;Simpsons&quot;
and &quot;Family Guy&quot;, and many many more. While it started out slowly on a
new Fox network, the series became a backbone of the station outlasting
its original writers, producers, and station owners. Al Bundy - YOU ARE
THE MAN !!!
