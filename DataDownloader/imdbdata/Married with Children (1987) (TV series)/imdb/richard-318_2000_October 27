I have been watching this since i got Sky digital a year ago and have loved
every episode i've seen since, unfortunately i've only seen up to series 4 i
think but i am awaiting the new series coming to paramount(not brand new
just first time in England). 
The show really should'nt be funny but it is there is nothing special about
the writing and there are not any really well thought out jokes it is overly
exaggerated but it is somehow funny. Al is the best character followed
closely by Bud, Als facial expressions i for some reason find really funny
and he comes ut with the best lines. There are classic moments that come
from visual comedy or sharp one liners, i especially liked the episode where
the Bundys had a Barbeque and cooked their burgers in Marcys Aunt's ashes,
when all was preparing to get cooking i couldn't stop laughing then he says,
LETS ROCK!.
One of the thinks i really like about the show is Christina Applegate
because basically she is fine!!!, when she was in the middle series she was
at her most sexy and in the early ninetys series she looks the most fine
piece of totty ever to grace the TV, Kelly Bundy is probably most guys dream
woman Sexy,blonde,sexy(deserves two mentions) not very clever(because we do
want interlectual superiority) and above all easy!!!.
The best show ever and thank god there are still loads of episodes left for
me to see.
