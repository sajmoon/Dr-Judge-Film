That is not an understatement.<br /><br />In it's heyday, Married...With Children featured some of the most clever,
inventive, wickedest and FUNNIEST writing on any series. But it only works
when you have the right people delivering the lines. Maybe this crew of
talent aren't the greatest actors ever, but they were the RIGHT actors to
play these roles. The character of Al Bundy will go down in history as one
of the greatest creations, worthy to be mentioned in the same breath as
Archie Bunker, Lucy Ricardo, Ted Baxter, etc.<br /><br />Just to correct one thing I saw written here about the show. The show was
just doing OK UNTIL the Michigan housewife's protest against the show. The
show started getting so much publicity, the ratings began to really take
off.<br /><br />I think the show started dying in the last three years or so, because the
writers just ran out of ideas. But I'll stack Season Three through Season
Six with ANY classic sitcom.
