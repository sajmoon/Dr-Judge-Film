The only reason why I can&#39;t give 10 points to &quot;Married with Children&quot;
is the laugh-track. However the show is so good that even laugh-track
can&#39;t totally ruin it. Well acting isn&#39;t very good, except for Ed
O&#39;Neill. He&#39;s almost phenomenal as a relaxed yet sort of depressed
family dad. Surely Christina Applegate is beautiful, but is that
enough.<br /><br />&quot;Married with Children&quot; has lots of good and funny moments unlike most
American sitcoms. It&#39;s also witty and satiric. There&#39;s a wife who does
simply nothing and two teenagers, the other is normal and the other is
stupid and slutty. And of course the dad/husband who owns a shoe shop
and has to deal with his wife&#39;s constant nagging. &quot;Married with
Children&quot; may seem like regular Yankee comedy, but it really isn&#39;t.
Why? Well - it&#39;s funny and it criticizes the all-American way of living
and gets most of it&#39;s humor from that. No this is no &quot;Monty Python goes
to America&quot;, but as an American comedy this one of the greatest.<br /><br />As summary I just say that &quot;Married with Children&quot; is a great show, but
laugh-track reduces points.<br /><br />(Again - it&#39;s hard to put all the stuff into words because of the
language barrier.)
