This show started off slow, as season one wasn't actually very good.  I
liked it at the time because it was rather fresh in the way the characters
didn't like each other.  But due to the chemistry between the cast members,
it really grew and by season two was quite hilarious - even watching the
reruns of it now.  This lasted up until about season 6, where the writers
must have gotten bored, and by season seven, with the introduction of that
putrid little kid character named Seven, the show had hit rock bottom.  One
almost had to feel sorry for the show, so far had it slipped.<br /><br />Luckily, the little kid character was dumped and, over the next several
seasons, the show did regain a small bit of its former glory.  Though a lot
of the episodes were dumb or just annoying due to the focus on the shrill,
perennially indignant neighbor Marcy, there were quite a few gems mixed in. <br /><br />And who can ever forget Kelly Bundy, played by Christina Applegate?  So
gorgeous it was cruel.  Probably the most beautiful person ever to appear on
television.  In my opinion, the back-and-forth between Al and Peg got old
pretty quick, but Bud and Kelly always had fresh, interesting ways of
picking on each other.  They had some of the best one-liners I've ever
heard, like when they go halves on a car, and Kelly tells Bud that he can't
touch it, because they don't know where his hands have been.  Bud comes back
with &quot;Well then, you shouldn't be allowed to sit it it!&quot;<br /><br />I'm glad they're coming out with this show on DVD.  I'll probably pick up
seasons 2 - 5, and maybe 9 - 11. I'd be amazed if more than three people pay
money for season seven on DVD.
