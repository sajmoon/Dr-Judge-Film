The first few seasons of this long-running series, I felt, were the
better ones, such mundane subject matter, totally believable
characters, something we all could identify with.<br /><br />I agree, it didn't pick up steam until the second or third season, but
the earliest ones were SO on the money, it just nailed it. Everyday
things, like playing softball, or Al's penchant for putting his hand in
the front of his pants, and Steve Rhodes' wanting to be one of the
guys, but somewhat henpecked by his wife, Marcy, etc.<br /><br />Making the characters caricatures of themselves, seemed to kill the
credibility of the show, Kelly Bundy for instance. Here you have a
good-looking girl, with some street-smarts, and limited book-smarts. We
all know the type. But making her so jaw-droppingly stupid, made for a
few laughs, but killed the credibility, as with Bud's hopelessness;
they each became what the other's insults made them out to be; it was
comical, but these things made the show lose its punch.<br /><br />This isn't to say that unrealistic things should've been left off; one
of the funniest episodes ever, had Al falling off the house repeatedly,
while Steve, who had just lost his job at the bank, was working in a
pet store. An animal he was caring for, bites Marcy, and she grows a
hump on her back. Ridiculous. But I laugh like an idiot every time I
see it.<br /><br />No doubt, the show lost its punch after a while, and it did scrape the
barrel for a while, but it will be remembered as one of the funniest
shows ever to air.
