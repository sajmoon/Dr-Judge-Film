This is not on my list of the absolutely worst TV shows of all time,
but it&#39;s right there on the fringes! Ed O&#39;Neill plays the idiotic Al,
who should never have been allowed to have children. *Ever*. Katey
Sagal gives a disturbingly bossy portrayal of his wife, Peggy, who
knows he&#39;s always wrong and she&#39;s always right... which can never work
in a sitcom. And down the stretch come David Faustino and Christina
Applegate as their two poorly behaved children. Once, when I was
discussing this show with someone, the other person suggested the
children should be force-fed some kind of medication, but I think that,
more than anything, they were just disrespectful brats. And the way to
solve that is to discipline them... why does that never happen in TV?
In shows like this and &quot;Grounded for Life,&quot; the children run around
crazy because the parents have no backbones! This is the example
children of the &#39;80s looked up to! That rant being over with, the
photography was horrible. The writing and direction were simply horrid.
And I&#39;m not sure if they used a real audience to provide the laughs,
but it always seems so unreal. Who could be laughing at humor like
this... a man who&#39;s more in love with his fancy toilet than his wife?
Give me a break.
