1999_September 7 

Married With Children has got to be the greatest show ever. I rate it right
up ther with Seinfeld and The Simpsons. Al is the king of sitcoms, Kelly is
simply divine, Jefferson and Bud were perennial losers, but kept me in
stitches with their antics. Peg was annoying and lazy but also quite funny.
Marcy was excellent. Her verbal jousts with Al and also Jefferson were
legendary!!<br /><br />Married With Children - 10 out of 10 !!
