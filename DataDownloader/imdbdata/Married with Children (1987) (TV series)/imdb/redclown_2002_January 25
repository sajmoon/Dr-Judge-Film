This is the greatest show ever. The majority of show either start out a
bit
weak and/or end out weak. But Married with Children is the opposite of
that.
99 % of the episodes are funny and poignant. This show is like a more
realistic Simpsons. A lot of people say this show is bad because it is a
bit
trashy,  but don't listen to them. This show was the beginning of
dysfunctional family sitcoms. Anyways, what's great about this show is
that
the majority of episodes could be repeated over and over again and not be
annoying. This is one of the few sitcoms that are actually funny. It's
just
a shame that his show isn't as famous as other crappier sitcoms.
