&quot;Married with children was certainly made to tell people not to get
married. It concentrates on the bad things of marriage but never on the good
ones. Anyway, it's very funny. This is the kind of family that people like
to watch on TV. People don't like to watch non-funny and boring families
like the Cosbies.<br /><br />My favorite episode is the one that they go to England. There is not an
episode funnier than that one. &quot;Married with children&quot; has a good cast and
they all act very well. One could say that the Bundies are like the
Simpsons. Though thank God they don't have characters like Marge and
Lisa.<br /><br />What I dislike about it is that they film ninety-nine percent of the show
in their house.  They should have filmed it in more different places like
the episode in England. People will certainly miss it and I hope they at
least keep showing reruns for a long time.
