&quot;Married... With Children&quot; was the original look at the dysfunctional
American family. Much like The Simpsons the early episodes took themselves a
lot more seriously, but became more slapstick towards the end. There isn't
much I can say about this show except that it's one of my favourite TV shows
of all time. Every line is clever and/or funny, and each of the characters
has their own little quirks. In a word...<br /><br />Brilliant 10/10...
