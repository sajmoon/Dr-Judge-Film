Married with children is absolutely brilliant comedy. In my opinion it has
got to be one of the best comedy's ever made (if not the best ever). Most
of
the episodes were excellent and had me in stitches I was nearly on the
floor
laughing.  Al Bundy (Ed O'Neeil) has got to be one of the best actors and
it
was a shame that this great comedy had to end.
