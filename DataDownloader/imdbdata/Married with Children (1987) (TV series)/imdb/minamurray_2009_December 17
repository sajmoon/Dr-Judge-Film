And no, this insufferable Bundy bunch was not trash because they were
white and not because they were poor - I am both. But for Heaven&#x27;s
sake, someone called these people likable? Well, if you are like them,
I suppose, but I weep for humanity! Actually, this is groan-inducingly
unfunny sitcom of a hee haw family with such sleazy characters than
nasty, sexist father and his violent, sleazy schoolbully daughter -
gutter-trash who should have been drowned in the sewers. That would
have been funny, instead of these oh-so-controversial jokes which made
me grimace instead of laughing. Now, fans, give me so many &#x22;unhelpful&#x22;
votes than you want.
