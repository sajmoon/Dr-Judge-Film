This long running American sitcom has a strange kind of following and
appeal. The show has a kind of knowing badness and is intentionally
cheesy and politically incorrect. The actors perform their lines with a
knowing wink at the audience, as if to say 'yes we know this crude,
rude, and lude'. The audiences at the recordings consist of primarily
hillbillies who woof, howl and screech in delight at as much as Al
flushing the toilet. It is infectious.<br /><br />The cast and characters are good. Ed O'Neil is superb as Al Bundy. He
makes the show as popular as it is. The facial expressions that he
pulls and his delivery are hilarious. Whatever Al says or does, makes
me laugh. Then there is his wife Peggy Bundy, the curviest woman alive
and a hell of a milf. It's another strange mystery of the show that all
of a sudden in season 2, Peggy turned into the delightfully huge
chested wife from hell audiences loved. It was a jarring change, sudden
in your face jubblies. Katey Sagal is excellent as Peggy and she
delivers the lines brilliantly. She can screech well too and every time
she cries out 'AL!' and he flinches we know why. Then there are the
kids. Every young Americans dream woman in the early 90's, Christina
Applegate who gets a deserved howl of male appreciation when she enters
each episode. Then Bud Bundy the young loser who despite being the only
Bundy with brains has no luck with the ladies, despite thinking he is
god's gift.<br /><br />Basically this show revolves around sexism, innuendo and machismo. You
see all the jokes coming a mile off. They have long running gags that
never manage to get tired, such as Peggy's constant jibes about Al's
sexual prowess. This is funny. It's love it or hate it but I love it.
