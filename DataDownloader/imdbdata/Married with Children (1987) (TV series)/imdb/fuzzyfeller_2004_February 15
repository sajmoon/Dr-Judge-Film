Simply should have been titled .how i made a comedy writing one
screenplay.every episode had the same plots,, peg a money hungry bitch
(why
did she stay married to al and how come he didnt throw her out ?)al -gross
pig and creep who always grabs himself and lusts after every other woman
except his wife ..kelly who wants to be a porno star ,,bud who thnks hes a
stud but is really a dud and marci who gets the door slammed in her face
,,
stupid dog with a voiceover by some unknown actor.  lather rinse repeat ..
how did they afford a house when noone else worked but al and he only made
like 200 bucks a week ,they must have been on welfare or used the govt for
cheap housing in the projects.
yet peg was always spending money but never had anything to show for it .
i
know its a sitcom but come on --ive seen more realistic comedy then this
trash .. notice what the stars are doing now ? nothing except for katey
segal although i wouldnt call 8 simple rules a good comedy
either.
