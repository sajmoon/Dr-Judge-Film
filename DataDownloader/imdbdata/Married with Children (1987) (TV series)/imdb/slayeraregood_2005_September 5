This is such a terrible sitcom, i have watched probably around 10
episodes, and all i can say is there wasn't a single genuine funny
line, all the 'hilarious' bits are typical things that narrow-minded
Americans find funny and are to me are just annoying, all the actors
are probably in the group of actors i call the 'worst and most annoying
actors of all time'. The American sitcoms i like are Fraiser - because
it is clever and well written, and simpsons, these are both quotable
series. Being from the UK i also like sitcoms like League of Gentlemen,
I am Alan Partridge, Spaced, Phoenix Nights, Father Ted and things like
Monty Python and loads more. I'm sorry if i don't 'understand' your
little overrated sitcom but the only thing i can do is laugh at how bad
it is and its realism.
