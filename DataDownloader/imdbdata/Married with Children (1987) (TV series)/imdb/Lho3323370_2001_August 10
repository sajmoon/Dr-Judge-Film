My mother used to watch this show when I was a little kid. And Now I try to
watch it in re-runs on my local Fox Station. Al is a shoe salesman who is
lazy when he gets home. Peg is always going to the mall With Marcy. Steve
tries to stay out of trouble. Jefferson usually visits the Bundy's to watch
sports with Al. Bud has a sweetheart in each episode. Kelly likes to party a
whole lot. Officer Dan is always on the lookout for bad people.
