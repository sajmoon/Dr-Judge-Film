This is coming from someone who just adores the Simpsons, and family
guy but the true classic of TV sitcoms is Married with Children. Every
episode you will get unbearably funny witty lines, mainly from Al
Bundy, but also some surprisingly funny stuff from Peg, Kelly, Bud and
Marcy. You will get the best ones out of Marcy and Al who absolutely
despise each other (they are neighbours by the way). Sitcoms now aday
can&#39;t hold a candle to this classic and you rarely hear a line as
witty, as insulting or as &quot;OOOHHHH BURRRRRRN&quot; type of funny. Please
find clips on youtube or get duds if they are out... or better yet
watch repeats, check your TV guide!!!
