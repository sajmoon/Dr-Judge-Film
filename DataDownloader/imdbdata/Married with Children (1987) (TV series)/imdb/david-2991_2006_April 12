I have to say I was surprised to find this funny, as I had heard many
different views on this production, but after watching a few episodes I
find it to be quite entertaining - it is like a real life version of
The Simpsons; Al/Homer (father that cares in his own way) Marge/Peg
(Housewives who are not all there upstairs!) and Bud/Bart (slightly
mischievous) Kelly and Lisa don&#39;t compare! I don&#39;t know how to describe
the comedy, and what makes it funny, it just is, possibly the
completely random situations that occur. Katey Sagal and Ed O&#39;Neil were
a great choice for the stupid parents, as was Christina Applegate and
David Faustino for Bud. I might buy some DVDs of the series if they are
available. Much enjoyed, worth a watch, UK on ITV2 19:00 - 19:30
