&quot;Married...with Children&quot; is the greatest show of all-time.  No family
before, during or after the Bundys will ever compare to America's first
family.  The Huxtables?  Don't make me laugh.  The Simpsons?  Get a life.
The Osbournes?  Are you retarded, because if you like &quot;The Osbournes,&quot; I
think that you are.<br /><br />Al (Ed O'Neill), Peg (Katey Sagal), Kelly (Christina Applegate), Bud
(David
Faustino) and Buck form the only television family that matters.  Extra
kudos to neighbors Steve (David Garrison), Marcy (Amanda Bearse) and the
damn funny Jefferson D'Arcy (Ted McGinley) for helping expose the Bundys
for
who they really were:  every American family.  The were dysfunctional and
absolutely hated one another, but they were as close as any family could
be
and when it came down to it, they were there for each other.<br /><br />The introduction of No Ma'am, the National Organization of Men Against
Amazonian Masterhood, only added to the insanity.  Bob Rooney (E.E. Bell),
Ike (Tom McCleister) and the incomparable Griff (Harold Sylvester) were
excellent additions to an already perfect show.<br /><br />&quot;Married...with Children&quot; obviously influenced a generation of awful
rip-offs such as &quot;Malcolm in the Middle,&quot; &quot;Grounded for Life,&quot; &quot;Roseanne,&quot;
&quot;Home Improvement&quot; and so on and so forth, but no one can deny it as man's
greatest achievement.  Many sitcoms come close, shows such as &quot;The Kids in
the Hall,&quot; &quot;MADtv,&quot; &quot;Cheers,&quot; &quot;Diff'rent Strokes,&quot; &quot;Seinfeld,&quot; &quot;King of
the
Hill,&quot; &quot;The Wonder Years,&quot; &quot;The Larry Sanders Show,&quot; &quot;The Adventures of
Pete
&amp; Pete,&quot; &quot;South Park,&quot; &quot;Maury&quot; (yes, I mean the talk show) and &quot;ALF,&quot; but
in
the end, the all pale in comparison.<br /><br />It is doubtful that all eleven season of the hit series will be released
on
DVD, but &quot;The Most Outrageous Episodes Volumes 1 &amp; 2&quot; are already
available.
They contain classics such as &quot;No Chicken, No Check,&quot; &quot;I'll See You in
Court,&quot; &quot;Raingirl&quot; and &quot;If Al Had a Hammer,&quot; which is my personal
favorite.<br /><br />To quote Eric Cartman, &quot;'Married...with Children' kicks
@$$!&quot;<br /><br />**** out of ****<br /><br />
