Ed (Al Bundy) is better than this.His acting
proves it.Not with MWC.It only lowered him.
Katey is a fine actress and didn't need this
to her credit.This to me is nothing more than
low class entertainment.<br /><br />Whatever happened to good clean entertainment 
like &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;,&quot;Leave it to Beaver&quot;?
Those were the days of family entertainment.<br /><br />The kind of Family entertainment that gets 
people these days is MWC and Roseanne.Family 
entertainment has gone bow wow.<br /><br />
