this show was truly at its best from 87-91 but after that it started to go
downhill some of the plots and situations were just to stupid and silly and
the episodes werent as consistent. al was definetly the best from his
facial
expressions to his insults to his philosophy and outlook on life he was the
king. after al i liked jefferson the best he was the lazy pretty boy
husband
of marcy and unlike steve he actually liked al.
