Over the years, there have been some funny shows, but only a few extremely
funny shows.  I Love Lucy and Sandford and Son are two shows that come to
mind.  However, in 1987, another show was added to that list when FOX
premiered &quot;Married...With Children.&quot;<br /><br />The show which was more true to life than any other sitcom at the time, has
made its mark in television history.  Granted that a lot of things on the
show were continuities and some of that stuff was plan far-fetched, it
showed that in a real family, not everything has a picture perfect ending,
ala Cosby Show or Full House.  <br /><br />One great attribute of this classic was that it's plot was continuously
funny, never succumbing to that emotional stuff found on other shows.  You
laughed throughout the whole half hour the show was on. <br /><br />Al Bundy is an American hero, scoring four touchdowns in a single game and
winning Polk High it's last city championship.  He was a brilliant
character, with lines that should be framed because of their
genius.<br /><br />All-in-all this was the funniest television show to ever come on the air -
hands down ~!
