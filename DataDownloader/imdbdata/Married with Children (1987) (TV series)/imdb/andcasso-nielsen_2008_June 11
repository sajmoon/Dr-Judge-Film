Twenty years. Geez has it really been that long since we first met the
Bundy family. I&#39;ve seen lots and lots of sitcoms. Some are pure crap,
others are decent and a selected few great. But &quot;Married... with
children&quot; is no less than brilliant.<br /><br />Why? On the top of my mind, it&#39;s because it isn&#39;t yet another sitcom
dealing with some dimwitted, fat guy, who is married to a woman way too
beautiful for him. The dysfunctional Bundy family is one of a kind on
television, and the series was never afraid to deal with subjects the
FCC and conservatives would like us to forget exists.<br /><br />If you are to watch a classic comedy series, don&#39;t watch that
Godforsaken Cosby show. Unrealistic crap. Watch &quot;Married... with
children&quot;. Eleven years after cancellation it still rocks! <br /><br />PS: Recently I saw a rerun of &quot;8 simple rules&quot;. A good comedy show,
originally starring the late comedy legend John Ritter as Paul
Hennessy. In one of the later episodes, taking place after the death of
Paul/Ritter, his wife Cate Hennessy (Played by Katey Sagal) meets an
old boyfriend, who is crazy about her... Played by no other the Ed
O&#39;Neil. It was a joy to see the two together again and this time as a
more... well... ordinary couple.
