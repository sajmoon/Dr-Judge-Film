This is one of the greatest sitcoms, and television shows, ever! I rank it
amongst &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; as one of my favorites. It had
the
guts not to put up with the average family fluff crap that was popular at
the time it was first aired. Now, this show has become classic. Who cannot
recall when Buck died, or when Joey Lauren Adams took Bud's virginity, or
when Peggy convinced Al to come home for a nooner. These are moments in
television history. This was a hilarious sitcom that, though I was sad to
see it go, was smart enough to depart, unlike many other sitcoms (&quot;Boy
Meets
World,&quot; anyone?) before it was no longer funny! Fox needs to show re-runs
of
this show sometime, maybe in that &quot;Simpsons&quot;/&quot;Drew Carey&quot; block
somewhere.
