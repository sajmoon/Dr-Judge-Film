Meet Al Bundy. He sells shoes. For women, no less. And not pretty ones,
either. His wife is a couch potato(a crimson-haired Sagal who never
misses Oprah), his son a dateless loser(who tries to be cool), and his
daughter an airheaded tramp(who takes great pleasure in finding Waldo).
And while he remains pathetically locked into the lower middle class,
his next-door neighbours, the Rhoades, freely flaunt their Mercedes,
their high-paying jobs at the bank and their position above him. Over
the course of the 10 years that this ran(!), Bindi... sorry, Birdie...
oh, nevermind... will start his own religion(to enjoy tax-exempt
status), become an inventor, will go to Washington and in general
try(usually ending up at the starting position, like the tendency goes
for sit-coms) to recapture his glory days(did you know that he scored
four touch-downs in a single game in high school football?). His life
may be miserable, but it certainly is never boring to watch. The comedy
is raunchy, crude(with that said, it is also clever, referential,
cartoony and at times, satirical), and not politically correct... in
short, an incredible release for all the pent-up anxiety and
frustration for every viewer forced to sit through the Brady Bunch and
every other &#x22;perfect family with well-behaved kids&#x22; that preceded this.
Finally, there was a group of people who you could point to and, rather
than go &#x22;man, why can&#x27;t we be like them?&#x22;, say &#x22;well, at least we&#x27;re
not as bad as them!&#x22;. This was the American Pie of its time; telling
teenagers that, yes, it is, in fact, OK. You&#x27;re not as weird or as
randy as you might think you are. And this extends that to the older
generation, as well; Ed O&#x27;Neill(who *nails* the role) voices many
opinions held by Conservatives(no, I do not always agree with them...
still, I defend the right to have them expressed in a free media), even
if they were no longer considered to be &#x22;ok&#x22;, when the changes(men
becoming metrosexuals, women gaining rights, computers, etc.). The
Liberals had their arguments presented(through Marcy), as well. This
very directly confronts actual issues from the time, such as the low
wages for public school teachers. The characters tend to be
unsympathetic, yet they capture and keep our attention. Part of us
wants them to succeed, and cheer them on. This grew as it progressed...
compare the pilot to later episodes, and you may have trouble
recognizing them. Early on, they didn&#x27;t cross the line much; later,
they pushed it whenever they could. In addition to a time capsule of
the late 80&#x27;s and most of the 90&#x27;s(from the perspective of someone who
grew up decades earlier), this, based on its popularity, is solid proof
that we do, indeed, need to blow off some steam sometimes. Does anyone
want to be these people? No. So you don&#x27;t see anyone trying. This is an
understandable reaction to TV of varying quality all based around the
idea that the only thing that could be presented was good examples,
something to look up to and copy. There is a lot of disturbing content,
violence(bloodless), sexuality(nothing explicit), and a little moderate
language in this. I recommend it to anyone not too prudish for it, and
especially fans of Benny Hill, &#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo and similar series. 9/10
