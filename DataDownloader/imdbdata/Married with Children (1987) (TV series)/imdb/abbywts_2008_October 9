I actually couldn&#39;t believe this show went on for as long as it did, I
thought it stopped in the late eighties early nineties. When this show
first came out, it might have had something to say at the time. The
most popular shows on TV at the time, were the family type shows, where
everyone learns a really important lesson. This show was like the
anti-Cosby. And for that, it was really good.<br /><br />However, a little goes a long way. After a while, the terrifyingly
stilted writing starts to grate, the &#39;it&#39;s obvious I&#39;m acting&#39; acting
style goes from noticeable to overbearing, and well, don&#39;t forget Ted
McGinley. Either he or Danny Bonaduce represent the kiss of death for
any show. Having watched several episodes in a row, it became
frighteningly easy to predict what would happen next in an episode. In
one, the son is being made fun of for being alone on his eighteenth
birthday when the daughter tells him he&#39;s got a phone call- a girl. I
said, &quot;It&#39;s going to be his grandmother or aunt.&quot; He makes a speech
about how he doesn&#39;t need anyone&#39;s pity-company and how he&#39;s a stud and
says, &quot;Hello Grandma.&quot;
