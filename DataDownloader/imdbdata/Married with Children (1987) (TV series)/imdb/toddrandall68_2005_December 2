I waddled through eleven pages of comments to see if anyone agreed with
me. I was surprised to find only 2 comments at the end that agreed with
me. This is probably not the worst show ever, but it always left such a
painful feeling in my head, and a bad taste in my mouth. I remember
going to my best friends house and watching this crap show with him. I
always enjoyed mocking him and this show. I noticed he doesn't watch TV
anymore, I guess he must have been ashamed.<br /><br />Al Bundy was a terrible comedic actor. His one liners and ugly
contorted facial expressions left me sick to my stomach. Why did he
always fall to the floor at the end of the show? Maybe he didn't
always, but the four or so episodes that I did see, he did. Peggy, or
the wife (whatever her name was) was truly disgusting, her annoying
voice seemed to me to be the point of most of her lame &quot;jokes.&quot; Peg was
pretty attractive, though, and made Kelly look like a skank. I guess I
got the point that she was a whore, and was not very smart. Did that
motif go on for 10 years? Bud annoyed me only for his feathered hair
that reminded me of high school. He was a pretty good actor, the lame
scripts he worked with probably typecast him and ruined his career. I
am embarrassed for all the people who called this the &quot;best sitcom
ever,&quot; which was apparently about 95% of the comments. They must be
retarded. One person even said &quot;Married,&quot; and &quot;Full House&quot; were the
greatest. I am guessing that she/he didn't get out of the house much.
The few TV sitcoms I did see, that I think were good (if you would like
to get away from the lowest-common-denominator jokes of crap shows like
&quot;Married&quot;) were &quot;Mary Tyler Moore,&quot; &quot;All in the Family,&quot; &quot;Family
Matters&quot; (just kidding) and &quot;Family Ties.&quot;
