If you&#x27;re tired of the family sitcom where everyone is clean cut and
respectful of each other then Married with Children is the show for
you. If you want a show that&#x27;s as completely different then The Cosby
Show then this is the show for you.<br /><br />The main characters: Al Bundy: A man who&#x27;s life is a living nightmare,
he sells shoes for a living and drives a crappy Dodge.<br /><br />Peggy Bundy: Al&#x27;s redheaded wife who loves Bon Bons and making Al&#x27;s
life a living hell.<br /><br />Kelly Bundy: The white trash slut of a daughter played by the gorgeous
Christina Applegate.<br /><br />Bud Bundy: The scrawny little loser who never gets any dates.
