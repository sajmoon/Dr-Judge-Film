Years ago, a little fledgling network called &#39;Fox&#39; experimented with
several pieces of programming which are now - legendary. No one thought
this network would make it past a year, but it went straight for new,
young and different shows than the other BIG networks were showing. In
the beginning &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, &quot;The Ben Stiller Show&quot; are
little known gems that come to mind - but &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;Married
WIth Children&quot; put Fox on the map.<br /><br />This show was ridiculously funny! It&#39;s blue collar, lowbrow, loads of
fun! Many critics predicted it&#39;s demise after just a few episodes but
the ensemble cast and the warped situations made this show a cut above
many at it&#39;s time, even against the big network programming. And it had
an audience - still does. Now it&#39;s in syndication and still is funny as
all get up.<br /><br />There are many episodes that are classics but they all revolve around
one premise: a shoe salesman (Al Bundy) who can never reach that top
break. He&#39;s your everyman, works for minimum wage but with his stay at
home wife (Peggy Bundy), you&#39;d never know! She spends his little money
like buckets. His son (Bud Bundy)is academically brilliant, but he
can&#39;t get a girl - his daughter (Kelly BUndy) is academically
challenged, but is very pretty and that always puts her in demand with
men and boys.<br /><br />The initial seasons had a the perfect yuppie couple move next door
(Steve and Marcy)who were the complete opposite of this family. They
were greedy, money hungry and snotty. This also provided a great
contrast to this lower income family. That was until in later seasons,
the husband walked out on the wife, and she woke up married to a gigolo
(Jefferson Darcy) - in complete contrast to all of her hopes and
desires.<br /><br />There&#39;s only one thing I did not like about the series - and that is
when they tried to make a spin-off. Ruined it for me, the characters
were annoying right from the start and didn&#39;t have the on sceen
charisma as the Bundy&#39;s had - they were trying to hard to BE the
Bundys. We already had one, no need for more.<br /><br />Every actor played their parts well - so well that type casting came
quick and folks forgot that everyone one of them had careers before
this show and were versatile in their craft - such as Ed O&#39;Neill. But
to his credit, he created an icon - &quot;Al Bundy&quot; and will forever be
associated with it, because he did it so well.<br /><br />Funny, rude, crude, many jokes about &quot;fat&quot; women that even made some
fat women chuckle at (and some jokes about fat women, yes they did go
TOO far) but everyone was a target at one point or another on this
show. A great cornerstone for FOX, a funny comedy about the most
dysfunctional family ever (note: no cursing, just serious punch lines!)
one of the best comedies of the 20th Century.
