When I first saw this movie, on a saturday, in December, in 1997, I was<br /><br />enthralled. From the opening scene, earth, glowing in hue, rising slowly,
you
know that this is not 'just another movie.' This is a movie someone
actually
took
time with. Took care to get all the detail right, make the screenplay
work,
keep
the graphics toned down... all at once.<br /><br />The Fifth Element pulls this off perfectly. The casting is superb,
everyone
fits,
from Sir Ian Holme, to Chris Tucker (in his first film appearance) to
Bruce
Willis
himself, replaying his role from Twelve Monkeys (another wonderful film),
one
begins to realise that Willis plays the sensitive character very well
indeed. This
was teh first Besson film I had seen at this point, and suffice to say, it
is his best
(Leon, and Le Grande Bleu comming in tied for second).<br /><br />Most stunning though is the plot. At first glance the plot seems like an
excuse to
have tons of actions scenes, but it's not that way at all. this is a love
story, not an
action film. But still, it's more then that. It's funny, it's got great
one
liners (Willis
steals the show here), the timming is beyond quesiton some of the best
I've
ever
seen (you'll ahve to see for yourself what I'm talking about). Did I
mentiont he
cast? Oldman is excellent, playing the villian once more- I'd just like to
have
seen Jean Reno in this!<br /><br />Back to the plot though, after reading the original screenplay I found
that
the
movie is compltely different. Besson must have been able to see these
little<br /><br />changes, and added them accordingly, jsut because they feel right (for
example,
int eh original screenplay, Oldman gets away- but in the movie, he suffers
a
fate
simialir to that he befell in Leon).<br /><br />I could go on for hours, but I wont. All I can say is this: If you don't
see
this movie,
you are missing out on one the best films ever made.
