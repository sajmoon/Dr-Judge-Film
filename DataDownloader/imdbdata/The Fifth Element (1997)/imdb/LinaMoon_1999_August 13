1999_August 13 

My husband and I stumbled onto this gem when it came out on HBO. We
absolutely love it!  I think we've both seen it at least four times and
our
children, now that they're older, are getting into it as well.  As many
have
commented, the Diva music scene is especially entertaining, and it is
definitely my most favorite. The music is almost haunting.  The
combination
of the visual (the actress, Maiwenn Le Besco) and the singing of Inva
Mulla
Tchako is truly compelling.  A &quot;must see&quot; for all -- you will not be
disappointed -- you will truly enjoy!!
