The visual effects are truly breathtaking and seamlessly
realised.<br /><br />The film portrays a detailed fantasy universe: we are given a good
impression of what life is like in a spectacular futuristic city, and a
sample of its diverse culture.<br /><br />There are scenes in the film that look like masterpieces by a great
sci-fi
artist.<br /><br />The humour is of the best kind: clever and unexpected.<br /><br />On the down side:<br /><br />- There are some dodgy performances by British actors (but Gary Oldman is
utterly mesmerising).<br /><br />- If you learn the whole of human history alphabetically, you get to
'Atom
bomb', 'Genocide' and 'Holocaust' (for example) long before you get to
'War'.
