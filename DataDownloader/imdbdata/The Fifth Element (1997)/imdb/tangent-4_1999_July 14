1999_July 14 

I personally liked this movie!<br /><br />Imagine a future where everyone is dressed by Gaulthier, and even
effeminate
black men can get an woman they want (there's hope yet!)<br /><br />I thought the sequences were great! (especially the Diva
sequence)<br /><br />The only part I disliked was the &quot;W-A-R&quot; sequence. (let's hammer the
message
home with an XL sledgehammer, shall we?)<br /><br />But seriously, you've got to love a movie where Gary Oldman is NOT playing
the weirdest character!
