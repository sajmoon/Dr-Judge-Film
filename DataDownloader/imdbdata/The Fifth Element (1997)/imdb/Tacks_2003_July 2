This film is Bruce Willis at his best. It isnt very well known, but it's
an
amazing futuristic, action, love story drama fantasy film with amazing
special effects and a great cast. Fight scenes are choreographed in a way
that almost seems like a dance, and the music and sound effects match
with
the mood of the film perfectly. It's an all around great film. Rent it,
buy
it, watch it.
