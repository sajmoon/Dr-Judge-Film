I really don't understand the bad comments for &quot;The 5th
Element&quot;....
In my opinion i thought it was a great sci-fi movie with wonderful special
effects and not too bad action sequences...it wasn't suppose to be a modern
masterpiece such as &quot;The Matrix&quot; or &quot;Star Wars&quot;, but it is a very visually
interesting movie with a good cast of actors and a fast beat
storyline.
My Rating 7.5/10.
