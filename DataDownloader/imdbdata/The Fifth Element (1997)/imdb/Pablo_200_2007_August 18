I don&#39;t have a top-ten list. I find it too hard to gauge movies I
really love. But if I did have one, &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; would
definitely be someplace on it. I fell in love with this work of
beautiful cinema 11 years ago (or so) when it was first released on
video. I&#39;m as much impressed with it&#39;s quirkiness now, as I was 11
years ago. Most movies get old after you&#39;ve seen them a zillion times
and whither away and die like an old rotten grape but this one doesn&#39;t.
It has stayed fresh all these years. And enough with all that
sentimental crap. Bruce plays a cab driver named Korben Dallas who
stumbles upon the Fifth Element, Leeloo--played by the beautiful Milla
Jovovich. Evil is on its way toward earth, and Leeloo--the Supreme
Being--is Earth&#39;s last chance along with four other elements
representing earth, wind, fire, dirt. The protagonist here is played by
the always-diverse Gary Oldman. His name is Mr. Zorg and he talks like
a used Arizona car salesman. He wants the stones and Leeloo dead so Mr.
Shawdow--the head evil-honcho--won&#39;t kill him I guess...but, if Mr.
Shadow succeeds in his Evil plan, and Leeloo dies, and the Earth&#39;s
destroyed, then wouldn&#39;t Zorg die anyway? Oh, well. It boggles the mind
to think about. Three quarters into the movie we&#39;re introduced to the
movie&#39;s most bizarre character, Rhuby Rod (Chris Tucker). Rhuby&#39;s a
good character but a bit too overwhelming. Mr. Luc Besson is very wise
to save him for the latter part of the movie.<br /><br />All in all a very very good movie. Bruce&#39;s character here is sorta like
John McClane, except a more modernized metrosexual version. But he
still can kick ass when he has to. There&#39;s also a killer opera sequence
with a hot blue alien chick going wild on stage.<br /><br />If you haven&#39;t seen it already, folks, give it a whirl.<br /><br />(Oh yeah, about Zorg. I guess if the Earth was destroyed he could just
fly to another planet. That makes sense. He&#39;d probably go to the one
with the really ugly aliens whose faces look like ugly pit bulls&#39;.)
