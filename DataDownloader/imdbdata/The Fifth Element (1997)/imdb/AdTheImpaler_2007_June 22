I know how difficult it is to read long, laborious reviews so I&#39;ll keep
this brief (except it has to be 10 lines!). The film is an
extraordinary feat - camp, ridiculous, lavishly over-the-top and
blessed with a crazy storyline, but insanely entertaining!<br /><br />The characters, though entirely unbelievable, are perfectly cast and
brilliantly written. From Bruce Willis&#39; wonderful attempt at a
&#39;low-key&#39; performance as the textbook reluctant hero, to Chris Tucker&#39;s
simply indescribable &#39;Ruby Rhod&#39;, laughs are more than aplenty.<br /><br />I challenge you to watch this and complain about its ridiculousness
without saying you could easily go back and watch it again, and
again... and again. Also, even if you defeat my challenge - surely you
can&#39;t deny the sheer spectacle of the mind-blowing opera performance in
the middle - a scene worthy of any great film.
