After looking for the name of an obscure character in The Fifth
Element, I came across a lot of negative user comment about this
film and opted to add my own &quot;two cents&quot;.
First of all, many comparisons have been made to Besson's
earlier work (esp. La Femme Nikita and Leon [aka &quot;The
Professional]) which is unfair. Previous Besson movies have been
concerned primarily with the analysis of one or two character's
motives. The Fifth Element attempts to address the shortcomings
and flaws of mankind as a whole. The fact that this is wrapped up
in some fairly bog-standard sci-fi-come-love-story packaging is
largely irrelevant and not necessarily to the detriment of the film as
a whole.<br /><br />Besson's movies are essentially about character and how their
relationship with other characters affect them throughout the story.
A little like John Hughes' work I guess. This is the case with The
Fifth Element. The two central characters played by Willis and
Jovowich are at opposite ends of the emotional spectrum. By the
end of the film both characters have met somewhere in the
middle: Leeloo (Jovowich) has come to learn &quot;humanness&quot; whilst
Korben Dallas (Willis) has found beauty, purity and perfection in an
otherwise drab existence.
Visually, The Fifth Element is stunning, mixing
Metropolis/Bladerunner-esque environments with European chic
to create something that is loud, noisy but genuinely beautiful.
Jean Paul Gautier's outlandish costume design, whilst bizarre at
times (like Ruby Rhod's leopardskin jump-suits!) gives a very
unique modern-ness not usually seen in tales of the future.
As mentioned earlier, The Fifth Element is just a very simple save
the universe love story but done with such style and humour that
the movie is a great watch from start to finish. Milla Jovowich is
gorgeous as the flame-haired Leeloo and takes a lot of the
movie's greatest moments: her pouting expression and wide-eyed
innocence is superbly acted. Willis is, as usual, adequate, as the
action hero (his best film is still Sixth Sense) and Ian Holm as the
bumbling priest lights up every scene he's in. Gary Oldman is okay
as the obligatory baddie but I think completely underused after his
excellent performance in Leon.<br /><br />Overall, The Fifth Element is a great little film. Fun to watch, pretty
to look at and every frame is a work of art (the one thing I love
about Besson's film-making). Sure, not his best film to date but
certainly not one which deserves the surprising amount of
criticism.<br /><br />4/5
