1999_July 10 

This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I felt
bad
giving it a 1; 0 should have been an option. The story
was
boring, the acting horrible, and talk about a waste of special
effects. Also, Chris Tucker is lucky he didn't kill his entire career.
Although I can't remember his name, the critic who called this film &quot;Star
Wars for the '90s&quot; should be demoted to writing reviews for high school
newsletters. I have a guideline for giving a movie the worst rating
possible: I have to want to leave the theater. I've seen technically
weaker
films but at least I didn't feel tortured by staying. YUCK!!
