1998_August 30 

Although the plotline was passable, the costumes and set designs were
atrocious.  Bruce Willis looked embarrassed to be in this movie and must
have been having flashbacks to Hudson Hawk.  I don't even want to comment
on Chris Tucker's &quot;Ruby Rhod&quot; character, but I may never be able to attend
any movie with him in it for the rest of my life.  All I know is I would
like an immediate refund on my money.  ICK.
