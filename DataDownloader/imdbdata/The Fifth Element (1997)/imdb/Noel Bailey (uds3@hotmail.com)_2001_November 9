THE FIFTH ELEMENT is a complex film....if you WANT it to be! It offers
varying levels of analysis depending on the tools you have to dig
with!
On the surface, a &quot;leave your brain in the cloakroom&quot; sci-fi yarn, you may
well find wanting!  As far removed from STAR WARS as Austin Powers is from
DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. this film is pitched uniquely at those who can laugh
at life but who have deep down an unquenchable desire for adventure and
the
romantic.<br /><br />Set on a futuristic earth, where really nothing has changed except the
technology, Bruce Willis is STILL John McLane, a has-been stormtrooper
reduced now to driving air-cabs for a living...same old premise for him -
nothing's changed much since STRIKING DISTANCE, except maybe the yellow
hair-rinse. Now, legend has it that in a time long long ago, the forces of
darkness visited earth and were repelled by the unification in close
proximity, of four stones representing the four elements. earth, wind,
fire
and water together with a fifth &quot;element&quot; of unknown origin.<br /><br />Dear old Ian Holm is Priest Cornelius, an expert authority on the five
elements and keeper of all knowledge on things magical and
mysterious.
Gary Oldman in arguably his most way-put role is General Zorg who has done
a
deal with &quot;The Dark Side&quot; and whose sole purpose is to take possession of
the elemental stones. The scene wherein he demonstrates the new weaponry
to
his alien henchman (from which the one-line &quot;summary quote&quot; above is
taken)
is an absolute classic of cinema.
Milla Jovovich (Married to Besson at the time of the flick) is absolutely
rivetting as Leeloo, the cloned/unzipped humanised fifth element. She must
have practised long and hard perfecting her ancient language
dialog....it's
amazing. She strikes exactly the right note as a being of purity,
femininity
and warrior woman. As the film progresses she assumes the identitiy of the
perfect girl any man would wish for and want to protect.<br /><br />The comedy angle is hysterical, the action sequences in your face, and the
fx generally impressive if not mega weird at times. Color and visuals play
a
major role in this pro-European production, the continent where not
surprisingly it was most successful. The outcome naturally is predictable
and in the best traditions of &quot;will love save the day?&quot; as if it wasn't
always going to???<br /><br />So, there u have it. Watch it one-dimensionally and that's what you'll get
back. let it flow, immerse yourself in IT and you couldn't fail to have a
good time, unless of course you are clinically dead or devoid of any sense
of fun or fantasy ....but in that case you'd be wasting your time anyway,
it
wasn't MADE for you!
