This film is truly excellent. Perfect casting and excellent effects.
Acting is without compromise and the Auria from the finale sequence is
out of this world. This remains one of my favourite films and ranks
along with blade runner and Lord of the rings trilogy. Respect to the
producers directors cast and crew. Truly an awesome job. Total respect
to the author of the story line, without doubt he has captured the
heart of many thousands of people and incited logarithmically more,
with his insight and imagination. This film i recommend to all film
buffs, and i am sure without any doubt will be an all time best. It
will always keep me firmly poised watching with intent.
