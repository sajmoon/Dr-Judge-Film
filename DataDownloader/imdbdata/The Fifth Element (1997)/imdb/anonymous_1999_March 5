What an amazing film, I know it's not other people's cup of tea but come on.
I'm fed up with the futuristic cities of the Earth looking like hellholes,
and Bessons image of the 21 century cheers me up immensely.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich was perfect as the innocent super-being and I fell in love
with her instantly. Bruce gave his usual cast-iron hard-luck case
performance and Gary Oldman was as horrible as ever. A brilliant and
enjoyable film, it doesn't go too deep but who wants Blade Runner every
time?
