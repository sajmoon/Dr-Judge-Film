I've seen the 5th element many, many times. And even years after I first
experienced it, the 5th element is still one hell of a ride.<br /><br />Entertainment as it was meant to be. The music. The actors. The comedy. The
drama. The action. The effects. The directing, they all make this movie into
an unforgettable two hour ride. A 10/10. (90% - 100% score)<br /><br />Sure, the costumes might look a bit silly. To some poeple Milla won't be so
perfect as the movie wants you to believe. The story probably wont be the
most surprising possible. Those, and all other negative things that are said
about this movie here, are totally irrelevant compared to what a movie is
about - entertainment. And entertaining it is, like very few other movies
out there. <br /><br />Thanks again Luc, for another great ride.
