OK, I saw this movie in the theater for the first time when I was 15
and I thought it was the coolest movie ever! And I'm now 22 and I STILL
think it's one of the coolest movies ever! For one, the humor
underlying almost every scene is hysterical! Secondly, the music, in my
opinion, makes the movie AMAZING!!! Thirdly, ALL the actors are just
phenomenal! The effects are incredible, and the color and display of
the whole film just blows me away every time. Gary Oldman, in
particular, is just awesome! And of COURSE Chris Tucker is in a league
of his own in this movie. Besides, what man could wear a rose covered
full body catsuit and STILL be appealing to women?? All in all, this
movie is great.
