1999_May 14 

The truest expression of what Ed Wood would've done with a big budget.
There
are so many lapses in logic and so many plot holes that the film borders
on
the incomprehensible at times. Anyone else notice the third group of
aliens
in the big climactic firefight, y'know, the ones that never appeared
before
or after? Or, where did the big mechanical duck alien trapped in the tomb
go--that is, where was his body when Bruce &amp; Co. show up? If Milla
Jovovich
was such a perfect specimen of humanity, how come she gets her butt kicked
not once but TWICE by aliens, once completely obliterated when her
spaceship
is blown up (besides, with 300 years head start technologically, you'd
think
the mechanical ducks would be able to avoid having their ships destroyed
so
easily) and again when she evokes Bruce Lee, gets her butt promptly
kicked,
and spends the rest of the film doing her impression of Sharon Stone on
painkillers in Casino so Bruce has to carry her around. How were they
supposed to get the necessary item from the Big Blue Diva (suppose
circumstances had been more pleasant?)? Other ludicrousness: Gary Oldman's
hair and accent, not to mention having the Evil Planet on his speed-dial;
way too much stuttering; what was that stuff on Gary Oldman's forehead (if
blood, where was the wound?)?; the duck aliens taking away the artifact
because WE couldn't take care of it...and the list is endless...
The ineptness of this film is awe-inspiring.
