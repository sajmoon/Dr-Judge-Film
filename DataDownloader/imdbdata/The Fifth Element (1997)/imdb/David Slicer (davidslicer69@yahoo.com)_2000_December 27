&quot;The Fifth Element&quot; is a mindblowing,sci-fi,action/adventure film set in the
future that has every element of a fun movie.Bruce Willis  stars as a
Brooklyn,New York cab driver who discovers that the world is bent on total
destruction.So he must team up with a mysterious,beautiful woman played by
Mila Jovavich who is the key to saving the planet.Visualy stunning,with
superb production design and a Terrific performance by Bruce Willis and Gary
Oldman,&quot;The Fifth Element&quot; is a fun film that is also raised to a more
humorous level by Chris Tucker,who steals the show along with the film's
visual effects.The fact that the Academy Awards chose to ignore the art
direction,costume design,makeup and visual effects make me wonder if
sometimes if the academy has any good taste.Bruce Willis,popular for the Die
Hard films,shows that he has a lighter side to himself in this movie.&quot;The
Fifth Element&quot; is a visual feast for the eyes and to me is considered one of
the best science fiction movies of all time.
