This must be one of the most perfect films ever made. Every time I watch
this movie I see new details. Everything is perfect. The story, the
ambiance, the music, the way is was filmed, the dialogues, even the
sound-quality and picture quality of the DVD are absolutely perfect.
Totally
enjoyable movie!
