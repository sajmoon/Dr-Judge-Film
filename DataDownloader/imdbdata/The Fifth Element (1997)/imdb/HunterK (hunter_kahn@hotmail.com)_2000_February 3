At first, I didn't know what to make of THE FIFTH ELEMENT. Much of it was
corny; some of it was just stupid. But when I stopped taking the movie so
serious, I really started to enjoy it. I thought it was a very fun
movie.<br /><br />THE FIFTH ELEMENT is about an evil force coming to destroy the world. Five
elements are needed to destroy the evil force and save the Earth. Four of
them are stones and one of them is a beautiful woman named Leeloo (Milla
Jovovich), who is absolutely &quot;perfect&quot;. A priest named Cornelius (Ian Holm)
seeks the elements to try to save the world while the military sends a the
retired Major Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) to find the elements and stop a
bunch of alien bounty hunter-like bad guys and a very evil man (and of
course very rich) man who is under the employment of the evil force named
Zorg (Gary Oldman).<br /><br />And of course, there is the insane but loved radio DJ Ruby Rhod (Chris
Tucker) who gets trapped in the middle of this whole thing and becomes the
comic relief of the movie, even though this movie really does not need comic
relief. At first you will probably find him annoying, but he will grow on
you. At least, this happened to me.<br /><br />The acting is fair, but nothing special. Chris Tucker does a good job as the
nutcase radioman, and Ian Holm does a pretty good job as the priest set out
to save the planet. This was a very different type of role for Gary Oldman.
He was still a bad guy, of course, but it was a much more comical part. It
surely wasn't his best work, but it was still OK. Bruce Willis did a great
job playing his part, and Milla Jovovich was excellent as the sexy but
strong fifth element.<br /><br />The special effects were fantastic. The story to this movie is nothing big,
but like I said the main purpose of this movie is for the viewer to have
fun. Don't expect to do much thinking and just enjoy yourself and I'm sure
you'll like this movie.
