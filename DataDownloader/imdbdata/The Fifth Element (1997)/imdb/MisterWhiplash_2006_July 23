The Fifth Element, years ago it now seems (and was), played a lot of TV
and I usually watched it many times when it was on. It&#39;s not really a
&#39;great&#39; film, or one that should be seen by all serious genre fans like
Leon- The Professional was for crime films. But it&#39;s probably one of
the most watchable science fiction adventures put to the screen in the
late 90s, a kind of techno-punk version of Star Wars meant more for the
late teens crowd than for everyone. It&#39;s story is simple enough- trying
to retrieve some missing stones that will help save the world from a
meteor or other about to collide and destroy everything, and the group
of people who can stop it- that its the colorful, strange supporting
performances and imaginative visuals can steal the show. Milla
Jovovich, more than anyone, makes her mark as a real kind of
&#39;breakthrough&#39; role (i.e. I never really heard of her before the movie
and for a while I thought of her as the &#39;5th element&#39; chick in high
school). Her role doesn&#39;t require too much dialog- as she barely speaks
English throughout most of the film. She&#39;s got the sexy look (PG-13
with nudity for the boys), lots of power in the fight scenes, and she
can even work the emotional scenes to. I would probably take her work
in this film over her other Besson collaboration in Joan of Arc, as
here she takes herself seriously for what she is, and it still ranks as
one of her very best performances so far in her decade long career
playing roles like this.<br /><br />The rest of the cast, however, is a bit more hit or miss, though a
little more hit than miss. Bruce Willis is his usually cynical,
hard-edged self with remnants of John McClaine kicking around as an
ex-officer turned cab driver who&#39;s recruited to take the &#39;5th element&#39;
(Jovovoich) to get the stones and to the temple. Gary Oldman is very
bizarre (see the &#39;blood&#39; or &#39;sweat&#39; or whatever trickle down his
forehead during a tense phone conversation) as a villain who is a kind
of pawn for the enemy, while also supplying weapon for a bunch of ugly
creatures. Some of his scenes are the funniest, while being very creepy
the whole while. Others like Tony Lister and Ian Holm are dependable as
always in uncomplicated 2-dimensional roles. Only Chris Tucker gets
pestering in his most flamboyant role to date (if that&#39;s possible) as
the &#39;comic relief&#39; in the form of a celeb host. I don&#39;t know if whether
the character is really the problem or Tucker&#39;s interpretation, but I
still feel those scenes are kind of distracting and below Tucker&#39;s
comic skills.<br /><br />But as a pure action spectacle, you could do worse than the 5th
Element, where it&#39;s a kind of future world with weird gadgets and
items, all in a more Earth-bound perspective. The main battle scene in
the opera is also on par with some of the better sequences in The
Professional. Sometimes the themes are hit a little too often,
repetitive if you will, like with Jovovich getting over-emotional
(though her little lesson on the history of the world via computer is
amazing). So it&#39;s not really as fantastic as Besson might think it is,
yet every time it was on I didn&#39;t change the channel much; it&#39;s got
that comic-book appeal where you know what will happen- of course in
repeat viewings- but you want to stay tuned for the really nifty
sequences and rewarding unconventional moments and lines.
