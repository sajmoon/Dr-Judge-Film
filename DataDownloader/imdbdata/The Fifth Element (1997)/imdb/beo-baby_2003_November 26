Yes, what makes this film tick is the ambiance. Everywhere you look in the
movie, the complete ambiance, clothing and technostuff is believable. It's
not another SciFi film, in which the technology changed, but the clothing
and social-life still are ancient. Okay the Diva looks like a smurf, but
then again, why not? It's completely believable, that people in the future
become more decadent, or that the now existing values shift into another
corner. Somebody torched this movie, calling some elements hand-puppets.
Right! And Yoda isn't? Give me a break. Don't forget the soundtrack which
fits in perfectly. Peter Gabriel does deliver. I give it a
10/10.
