You have a brave knight in shiny armor. You have a beautiful princess. You
have forces of darkness above world's future. And you have all that and more
played in 23.century. ,,The Fifth Element'' is a beautiful fairytale, with
lots of humour, spirit and flair. Plus, it looks tremendous, with special
effects being truly spectacular. If somebody says that the plot is naive or
even stupid, then that somebody has left his imagination and spirit
somewhere in kindergarten. This is the best movie ever made for all those
never-grown-up children in the world. Me included.
