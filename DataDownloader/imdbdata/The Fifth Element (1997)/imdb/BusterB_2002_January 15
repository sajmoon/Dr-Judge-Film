I had seen only two of Besson's past films when I rented this one. La
Femme
Nikita and The Professional I found thoroughly enjoyable, but The Fifth
Element was just more clich&amp;eacute;-ridden American celluloid.<br /><br />Now, I was looking for something specific. In both Nikita and
Professional,
Besson employed delightfully flawed main characters. Does Nikita deserve
the
mind-twisting manipulation she's enduring? She's a victim of ruthless and
calculating people, but on the other hand she's a cold-blooded bitch
killer.
Do I like L&amp;eacute;on? He's a sympathetic, child-like man, but on the
other
hand he's an efficient executioner. I find myself thinking about these two
often: they raise questions about what I feel about the world and
why.<br /><br />All of the characters in The Fifth Element were stock items. Bruce Willis
played, once again, Bruce Willis. I liked Moonlighting and Die Hard but
how
many times can he play David Addison in yet another movie and have it
continue to work? Gary Oldman was rehashing Norman Stansfield from The
Professional with minor adjustments. The rest of the movie amounted to
nothing more than a giant treasure hunt and chase scene, culminating in
too
many gender clich&amp;eacute;s to count and a sickeningly sweet monologue on
the
nature of love. The whole effort left me cold.<br /><br />Now, if you don't make the connection with Besson's earlier films, and you
just want to see a bit of fun, over-the-top science fiction fluff, then
The
Fifth Element may be for you. If, like me, you enjoyed Besson's earlier
complex characters and are looking for more of the same, then avoid this
one
like the plague.
