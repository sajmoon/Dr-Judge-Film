This is one of the films of my life. For everything. Maybe it's because of
those dreamy visuals of the 22nd century, maybe it's because of the way
Besson sees it, maybe it's because of the way Eric Serra gives it music,
maybe it's because of Milla's smile, maybe it's because of its harmonial mix
between action, comedy and drama. Maybe it's because of all those things
combined. I just know that we can't situate this movie in any genre, since I
don't see it as a science fiction movie, or a drama or a comedy, a bit like
&quot;The Big Blue&quot;, a bit like &quot;Leon&quot;. Certainly (i'm sure) an epic movie in all
the meaning of the word. I loved every minute and when I become a movie
director, Besson will be my guiding light, since he sees things like I like
to see them: BIG. Every shot of this movie is measured epically. I loved it,
no matter what, Jovovich, Willis, Tucker, Holm, Oldman, they all have talent
to spare, and once more, you, Luc, if you read this, I want you to know you
already are an inspiration. Congratulations, this movie is worth every penny
spent in it, and every drop of sweat shed. I could watch it once a day and
not get tired.
