I&#39;m sorry for my poor English. Why do directors underestimate us? If
this is a movie for 10-12 years old children, then they should tell us
not to waste our time. What is this &quot;-5000 degrees&quot;? Absolute zero is
-273 degrees. How can I believe a movie, when in the very beginning for
example, a man cannot see and feel thousands of watts lights, several
aliens walking like elephants right behind his back? When an educated
man is crying to obviously very hi-tech creatures that he will &quot;shoot&quot;?
And why these creatures are speaking English between themselves? It&#39;s
ridiculous. Things like this present in the movie almost every minute.
This insults me. I&#39;m really sorry that I cannot write in Enlish exactly
what I think, but I hope that you got the line. Thank you.
