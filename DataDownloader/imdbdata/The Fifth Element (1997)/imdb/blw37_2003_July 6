The fifth element tries to combine action, science fiction and humour in a
single stylish package.  Unfortunately it is not equally successful in all
of its endeavours.  The plot (about an attempt to reunite four missing
stones representing the four elements of earth, air fire and water with a
mysterious person representing the fifth element) is full of B-Grade science
fiction cliches and frequently strays into the implausible.  The action
sequences are more successful and occasionally become involving.<br /><br />The idea of leavening the mix with humour was appealing in concept but, in
execution dissolved into stupidity on too many occasions (especially with
respect to a very camp talk show host), and jarred with the rest of the
movie.<br /><br />Overall, an average movie, although fans of Bruce Willis may rate it
slightly higher.
