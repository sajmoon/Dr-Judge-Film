i myself liked it, and if you're going to criticize something, maybe
you should actually explain why you hated something, instead of just
saying &quot;I hated it&quot;. I thought it had sort of a sex appeal to it. Bruce
looked pretty damn good in it too. I think that if what your saying is
true, that a high-schooler wrote it, then that just makes it even
better. How old are you, anyway? You must be old, not to be able to
appreciate the movie for it's action and fun. Oh well, I'm done talking
to you, whoever you are. Plus, it doesn't really matter what you think
because obviously someone liked it enough to produce it, and for people
to watch it when it came out, and still watch it today. so goodbye,
grumpy.
