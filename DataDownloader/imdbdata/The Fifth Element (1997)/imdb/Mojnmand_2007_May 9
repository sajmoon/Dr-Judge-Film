I hate this movie. But I hate Bruce Willis even more. Somehow he
manages in all of his movies to run around wearing nothing but a ripped
t- shirt, an unshaved face and a suffering expression in his oh- so-
pretty eyes. This is more or less his only &quot;talent&quot;. He is through and
through a bad actor, and I can&#39;t for the love of God even begin to
imagine why some women find him charming and some guys find him cool.
He is nothing but a crappy actor who can&#39;t grow hair anymore. Jovovich
is the same. I can&#39;t stand her either. She is a poor actress. I think
her one dimensional character in this movie is to hide her flaws as an
actress. They didn&#39;t do that when she starred in Joan of Arc, and here
she succeeded in making Joan come off as a complete nut case. As for
the movie in general: Bad story, bad costumes, bad everything. Avoid it
at all costs.
