1999_February 7 

The Fifth Element is one of my favorite movies.  At least some of the reason
I like it so much was I first saw it right after I'd had some bad times in
my life, and it was a real break to watch something that was just plain FUN.<br /><br />Most people who don't like this movie probably either expected an action
film or sci-fi adventure.  It's neither and both at the same time.  Just sit
back and enjoy it, don't bother trying to rationalize.  A wonderful, exotic
soundtrack, humor and comedy in spades, and a future New York that has
COLOR.  Most people are so used to the dark and grim future bit that seeing
a world brightly lit and animated is a sight for sore eyes.  You have to
admit it takes a certain chutzpah to decorate the President's office in
lavender!
