I love this movie and I must have watched it 15 times at least. Its one
of those film where you can sit back, switch off your brain and let
yourself be enveloped into a world where Evil is trying to take over
the universe and there is only one person who can stop it.<br /><br />It&#39;s set 300 years in the future and has a good mix of comedy and
action which will please most movie going fans. Plot is reasonably
simple and our hero&#39;s move through a barrage of set pieces in order to
get to conclusion of the movie.<br /><br />It has a great cast, Willis - Oldman - Jovovich and a lovely little
stint from Lee Evans. They all worked well together and they seemed
like they were having a lot of fun working on this movie. They all
dress in amazing costumes that I hope to hell that we, as a species,
never actually start dressing like. Visually stunning you may feel like
you have to watch the movie again just to appreciate if fully.<br /><br />Oldman Pulls off the whole bad guy routine so well, his character is
also silly but you can believe that he is as mean as he makes out to
be. Chris Tucker plays probably the most annoying person ever to grace
the big screen. If he is like that in real life he should be shot. But
that was his part and he played it well. His Haircuts alone make the
movie worth watching.<br /><br />Anyway, if you like movies with explosions, hot actors, comedy and a
plot line that doesn&#39;t requires a masters degree to understand. This is
for you. So switch off your brain, engage you popcorn arm and sit back
and enjoy this for what it is. A silly space romp!
