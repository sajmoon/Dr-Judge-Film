1999_February 8 

At it's core, it's another action movie. An above average one, to be sure.
But it's dressed up to be as bizarre as possible. But only the details are
bizarre, like Gary Oldman's southern accent or Luke Perry showing up in a
bit part. The trouble I have with it is that it's deliberately strange. They
were trying too hard to be 'out there' and as a result it comes off as more
normal than they might have intended.
