I saw it, I liked it, (in spite of Chris Tucker) I bought it on
DVD!
It's got holes in the plot you could drive a truck through but I don't
think
it was ever really meant to be taken seriously &amp; it falls a long way down
in
my list of Bruce Willis' turkeys.
Watch it, don't take it seriously, turn off the sound when Tucker's
around &amp;
enjoy!<br /><br />Of course, I could be wrong................
