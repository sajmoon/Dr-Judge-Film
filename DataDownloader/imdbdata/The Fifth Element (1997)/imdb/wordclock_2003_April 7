I liked this film. I like the way Bruce Willis is expertly cast as the
same character he played in the die Hard films, Armaggedon, and
most of his others too! He's the reluctant hero, the one who saves
the world in his vest even though he's retired, and doesn't want to
get involved. Milla Jovovitch is actually very attractive for a change,
Ian Holm is great (well he's ALWAYS great) and Gary Oldman -
great part for him, but REALLY bad accent!<br /><br />and...<br /><br />The sheer look and feel of the film is superb. The costumes are
spot on, the aliens are great, the effects cool (I loved the &quot;cruise
ship&quot;.<br /><br />So much so that I just went with the flow, ignoring the holes in the
plot and the series of very wooden incidental  cameos from
has-been musicians and loving the STYLE of it. Very compelling,
like Bladerunner, very silly, like Galaxy Quest, and very stylish, like
Lynch's Dune.<br /><br />Highlights: &quot;Anyone else wanna negotiate?&quot;
&quot;I'm very disappointed&quot;
&quot;Multipass&quot;
the bit with the &quot;red button&quot;
and &quot;I'm Korben, and you are...?&quot; &quot;Leeloo Minai
