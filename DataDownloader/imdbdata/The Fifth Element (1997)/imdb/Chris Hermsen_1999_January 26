1999_January 26 

I think &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; is one of the best films I saw last year. I also
believe I am practically the only one to think so. Every critic slated this
film, because of its similarities with standard, trashy Hollywood films. I,
on the other hand, think it was superb. The acting, especially by Milla
Jovovich, was excellent, the music by Eric Serra was terrific, the
cinematoprahy by Thierry Arbogast was brilliant, the story was great. I
especially likes the &quot;over the top&quot; qualities of it. Every one else thought
it was a standard story, full of cliches. But the fact that the story forms
a parody on the genre it &quot;belongs&quot; to, made me enjoy the film even
more.
The most brilliant part of this film was, however, its editing. In &quot;The
Fifth Element&quot; there are 3 or more brilliant scenes that made several
storylines blend together.
In short, The Fifth Element was FANTASTIC, and I gave it a
10.
