1998_November 25 

I must admit, I loved this film.  It's nice to see a wacked-out
left-of-mainstream story made into a film without being co-opted by Producer
sensibilities. This is the kind of action/sci-fi movie I miss seeing: a
simple plot made a bit convoluted by the genre, really neat-o special
effects and art design, and a good, old style good guy and bad guy.<br /><br />Bruce Willis does what he always does in this film, and fortunately, it
works. Milla Jovovich was amazing in this role. It's hard to believe this
was the same actress I'd seen in 'Return to the Blue Lagoon' (Yuk!) and
'Dazed and Confused'. Gary Oldman is fantastic as always -- love the hair.<br /><br />But what made this movie work for me was the art design. For once, we get a
look at a technological future that isn't all
dark and grim, just a little dirty and patched together in spots. The colors
used, the way things seemed to be strangely logical extensions from what is
around now-- it all gelled for me into a coherent world which I could buy
into. I could ignore the few plot-holes with ease, because I was enjoying the
story and the VIEW.
