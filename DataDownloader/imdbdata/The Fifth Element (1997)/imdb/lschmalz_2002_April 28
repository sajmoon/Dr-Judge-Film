Although I am not a sci-fi movie fan, I did find this movie highly
entertaining and funny.  Set in the future, Bruce Willis plays Korben
Dallas, a retired military soldier turned taxi-driver who becomes involved
in a battle of good vs. evil, when an alien being, Leeloo, (Jovovich)
&quot;lands&quot; in his taxi one night.  Leeloo is &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;, the last
piece of a puzzle that, when put together properly, will save the earth from
the evil Mr. Zorg (a fun performance by Oldman) and other equally nasty
forces.  Korben must find the other four pieces of the puzzle, which are
being kept in a hotel.  Can Korben and Leeloo find the four stones before
the bad guys?  Will the earth be saved? Will Korben and Leelou fall in love?
 Does this movie give us any reason for them to fall in love besides the
fact that Leeloo is beautiful and has a body to die for?  Who cares!!  The
movie is fun, and although there are some gaping holes in the plot (i.e.
Dallas just throws caution to the win and helps Leelou escape from the
police, although he doesn't have any reason except that she's adorable),
it's still action packed, funny and worth your time.  Look for a fabulously
funny performance by Chris Tucker as Ruby Rhod, the nightclub
singer.
