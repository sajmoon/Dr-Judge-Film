1998_September 18 

This could have been a great sci-fi movie, (and it is as far as great
special effects),  but the addition of  ridicule scenes that the director
probably tried to pass as funny really make you wonder how Bruce Willis put
up to make  this film ($$$ of course).  Nevertheless the film is
entertaining if you watch it  just for the thrills of the FX's.  This is
definitely a 5.
