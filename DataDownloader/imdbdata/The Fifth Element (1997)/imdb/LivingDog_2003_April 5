I can't help but comment on the perfection of this movie. I stick by my
original comment. What I want to add is that this is a perfect classic scifi
b/c it gets better each time I watch it. I must have seen it about 8 times
now.<br /><br />Willis (as Korben Dallas), Tucker (as Ruby Rhod), and Gary Oldman (as
Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg) are equally brilliant super-nova actors. The
rest of the caste is so perfectly chosen that any slight deviation would
have weakened the movie noticably with an &quot;empty&quot; spot sticking out in the
middle.<br /><br />The production, set design, costumes, makeup (including the wounds received
by all - note all! - even Korben's wounds in the following scenes are
maintained giving Continuity a perfect record!), etc. are all the most
exceptional I have ever seen in movie history.<br /><br />I use to think &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; was the best scifi ever made... maybe I
have a new winner.<br /><br />- Zafoid<br /><br />PS: Remember, God is love.<br /><br />- Z
