Some people said &quot;boring&quot; some said &quot;terrific and funny&quot;, but nobody
mentioned being surprised. I was. Not so much as by the story line, but
what
came with it.... Think about it. Ever said the phrase &quot;I am a meat
popsicle&quot;
before? Say it out loud. It's funny. And try asking people if they're
&quot;green&quot;. That's funny, too. So, in other words, this is a new kind of alien
movie... it has alien writing, too. Just as a sider, though, how come
Korben
Dallas (Willis) displayed a ready sense of humor in the first (like when
that guy tried to rob him....the one with the landscape hat) and then, when
the funny man (Chris Tucker) came on, he was so stiff? Why is that? Hello
are you there? Anybody out there?
