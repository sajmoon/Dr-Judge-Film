1999_July 24 

The things that I wanted to say about this film is just five
things.<br /><br />Before talking about the first thing, I'd like to tell the directing style
of Luc Besson. If you see movies like 'Leon', 'Le Grand Bleu', AND of
course
'The Fifth Element', most of the people would see a real interesting plot.
When you see the first half or 2/5 of the movie, it would look REAL
interesting. But after that, it would feel silly, incomplete, or finding
the
plot too predictable. This is the first thing that I wanted to say. To make
it simple, Mr. Besson finds stories that look interesting, but most of the
times incomplete the conclusions of his films.<br /><br />The next thing I want to comment is the acting. I knew that Bruce Willis
wasn't a good actor but he never acted so bad like this in other movies.
And
one more thing that I don't understand is that why actors like Gary Oldman
accepted to star in films like this.<br /><br />Now to the third. This movie wasn't a total loss. Chris Tucker, as he
always
were, rocks the movie! He was so funny and he didn't act that bad as a
rookie.<br /><br />Once again, the directing, editing, and the acting may suck but the visual
and special effects were good. Cartoons like Futurama kind of copied the
part at the first scene of this film.<br /><br />Next one is a simple one. You would either like it or hate
it.<br /><br />I give it 6 out of 10.
