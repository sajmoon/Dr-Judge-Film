The Fifth Element is another fine example of the filmmaking talents of Luc
Besson. Luc Besson, a creative genius and the director of classic films such
as The Big Blue, Nikita and Leon (The Professional) has returned to the
genre that started his filmmaking career, sci-fi. In The Fifth Element Luc
Besson realises his life long ambition to make a film based on a story he
thought of while still at school, Zaltman Bleros. Writing and directing the
film, he skillfully mixes humour with action and amazing visual effects that
put The Fifth Element in a class of it's own. Stunning performances are put
forward by Milla Jovovich, Bruce Willis, Ian Holm, Chris Tucker and Gary
Oldman, who returns to work with Luc Besson after playing Norman Stansfield
in Leon. The Fifth Element show us how well comedy, action and romance can
be put together. Overlooked at the Academy Awards, Luc Besson won the Cesar
for Best Director at Cannes in 1998 for The Fifth Element. Simply, an
excellent film, 10/10.
