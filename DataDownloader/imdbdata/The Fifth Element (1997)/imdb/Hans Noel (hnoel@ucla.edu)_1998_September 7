The Fifth Element is right. Luc Besson has taken four sci-fi cliche
elements and added just one element allegedly worth watching.
Cliche 1: There is a purely aggressive warlike race that has somehow
managed to not kill itself off. (Klingons, Draconians, etc.)
Cliche 2: The universe is to be saved/destroyed by some mystical
MacGuffin that everyone is chasing after. (The Genesis device, the Galaxy,
etc.)
Cliche 3: A wiser power is shocked to discover that mankind has this
thing called &quot;war.&quot; (The Abyss, Q, etc.) (Bonus points for apparently
forgetting the warlike race in Cliche 1.) 
Cliche 4: Said wiser power is also puzzled because Mankind has this thing
called &quot;love.&quot; (The Abyss, E.T. etc.)
New &quot;Fifth&quot; Element: A neat look, including costumes by Jean-Paul
Gaultier. Cool, but isn't eye-candy a cliche too?
