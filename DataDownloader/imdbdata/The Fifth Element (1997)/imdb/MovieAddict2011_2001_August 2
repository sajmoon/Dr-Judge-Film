When you're watching this movie, at first it seems a bit weird. But once you
get into it, and think of it as the future of the world, it's not AS weird.
The plot is evil is a threat to the world 250 years from now. The fifth
element is the only thing that can save the world from its doom. Bruce
Willis plays a taxi driver who is an ex-soldier. He stumbles upon what seems
to be the fifth element....but the surprise is, it's not what you think it
would be. I won't give away what the fifth element is, or how he finds it,
but I'll tell you that it's a good movie and it's definitely worth renting
out at the movie store. 3 and a half/5 stars
