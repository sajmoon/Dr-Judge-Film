Note that this movie may excite any male science fiction fan, but completely
sabotage every female science fiction fan with the comparison in this film
of male versus female. Every female in this movie either gets beaten up,
killed or is sexually depicted if not mollested! All males in this film are
either strong heroes, super-villans or hard-a&#149;&#149; punks&#133; so, what's the deal,
right: after all, the heroin in this movie is female&#133; truth is that even she
is illustrated as weak in most other ways (save from her one moment at the
end). I wouldn't see this movie again if they paid me to! Where's the
Princess Leia that stands up for those who cannot fight for
themselves?
