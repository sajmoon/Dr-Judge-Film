1999_May 14 

Slightly amusing and entertaining sci-fi action adventure. Mainly
watchable
for some amusing performances and character stereotypes - MTV-type talk
show
host, &quot;perfect&quot; model female, action man Willis, and Oldman as the comic
Zorg. Overall, story lacks originality and remains predictable and often
overbearingly a same-old Hollywood action flick. Not even amusing in the
over-used references to previous original sci-fi movies.
