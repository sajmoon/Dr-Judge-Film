I watched The Fifth Element over and over again. I thought it is a very
good movie. I must say, though, it was intense. But not intensely
enough. But yet, very good. Bruce does a wonderful job at acting! Hope
he doesn&#39;t give up! So keep up the good and wonderful work! I not only
like his acting job, but I also like his producing job. I don&#39;t have
much more to say, except, Keep up the good work! My name is Ashley, by
the way. I&#39;m 16 years old and I am in the 11th grade. I also go to
Herbert Hoover High School and starting to Carver. Well, I just added
that to get my 10 lines in and I succeeded! Keep up the great work!<br /><br />Yours truly,<br /><br />Ashley
