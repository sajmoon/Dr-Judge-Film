Fifth Element is a classic, a good mix of comedy and sci-fi with a  style
that is unique. It is the sort of movie that you either love or hate and
most people I know love it.<br /><br />Not in the same class as Leon, but this is still a very well produced
movie.
Gary Oldman is excellent as an over the top bad-guy, Bruce Willis turns in
a
solid performance and Milla Jovavitch is a revelation - one of her best
appearances on screen.<br /><br />Special effects are very good too.
