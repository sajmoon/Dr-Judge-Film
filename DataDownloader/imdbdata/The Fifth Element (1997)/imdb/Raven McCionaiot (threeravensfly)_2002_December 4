I really enjoy watching this movie from time to time.  My movie collection
is weighed down with the classic movies, the complex movies, dramas, etc.
But every now and again, when I just want something light and
entertaining,
this is one that I reach for.  I will agree that if you try and watch it
for
something more than pure mind-numbing entertainment you are going to be
sorely dissapointed.  This is no 6th Sense, by any means.  The dialogue is
weak, the plot is thin at best, and cliche at worst.  No hard-core sci-fi
fan should ever watch this, unless they sign an afidavit to withhold all
critique (yes, I know what havoc would be wreaked if there was suddenly a
second moon in orbit around the Earth).  This is one of those movies that
you watch after a particularly hellish day at work, or right after the
last
day of finals, etc.<br /><br />And besides, who doesn't enjoy watching a half-naked Milla Jovovich kick
alien ass?
