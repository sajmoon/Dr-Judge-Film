It's a science fiction ... no, wait ... it's a comedy ... no, wait ... it's
a bad Italian film with disjointed continuity ... no, wait ... it's a Bruce
Willis vehicle - no no, wait ... it's an obnoxious Chris Tucker in a jacket
that might just be an equally obnoxious dress ... no, wait .... it's an
Opera with a big blue octopus women that dances .... no, it's...<br /><br />Luc Besson's Monster!!<br /><br />Ok, it was better than Star Gate, but only because Milla gets naked. And it
doesn't have that Crying Game guy in it. Can't blame a good director for
biting off more than the studios can chew, but it really helps if your name
is Terry Gilliam. ;)<br /><br />'nuff said<br /><br />
