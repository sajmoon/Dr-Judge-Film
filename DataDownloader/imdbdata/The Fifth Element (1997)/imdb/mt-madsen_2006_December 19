This is easily the best science fiction movie ever made. It mixes
futuristic thematics with some kind of religion, action, funny scenes
and of course it also features a true love-story. Old times, new times.
This is one of Bruce Willis&#39; best performances. The look in his eyes,
the smile and the laughter. All this put together with one of Luc
Besson&#39;s best directed movies, make for a real science-fiction
masterpiece. Beautifully made. The music is great too. It sets a
certain atmosphere. A good atmosphere... After all that is said there
could still be said lots of things. i just wouldn&#39;t know at the moment.
This is an inspiration to other movies following it. It sets new
standards, and it sets &#39;em real high!
