2001_April 17 

I purchased this movie on Pay-Per-View, and almost immediately wished I had
saved the three dollars.  I truly think this may be one of the worst movies
ever made.  The characters were boring, the plot was non-existent, and the
soundtrack was terrible!  There wasn't even an attractive girl to look at,
something the most boring movie usually has.  Two long rap sessions had me
diving for the remote control, to turn the sound off.  Horrible!  At this
time, I cannot even think of a single redeeming feature of this film.  Does
anyone know what the story was supposed to be about?  I certainly could not
figure it out.  All in all, I use this film as a base to judge other bad
movies against.
