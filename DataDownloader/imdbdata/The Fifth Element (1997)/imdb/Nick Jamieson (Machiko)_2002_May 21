Personally, I put this movie on my own top Twenty Best Science-fiction
movies. It has everything you look for in a god sci-fi flick - the essential
car chase, a big honking enemy no one thinks can be destroyed, the elemental
gunfights, and a supplementary romance that doesn't overshadow the fun of
the film. Willis is a strong actor, bringing sensitivity to his character,
as well as that classic Die Hard cop we all love. Jovovich is a cool
actress, with a lot of future potential (Look for her in Resident Evil). The
ensemble cast was funny and recognizable, and altogether, I would buy this
movie.
