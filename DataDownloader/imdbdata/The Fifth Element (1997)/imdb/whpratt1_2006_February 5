Enjoyed this picture from beginning to end and believe that some time
in the future we will be traveling around in Taxi cabs just like the
one Bruce Willis (Karben Dallas) did in this film. All the appliances
were created for speed and everything was in a big hurry like New York.
Bruce Willis is a retired Army Officer who is drafted again by very
powerful Military Officials, in a way it is a good thing, since he just
lost his job. Milla Jovovich, (Leeloo) is a very, very slim and trim
gal and was quite sexy in this film, considering she was called the
perfect human being that was going to change the world. There is plenty
of action and romantic scenes between Karben &amp; Leeloo and a very
entertaining film.
