I know that there are many who love this movie. My view is that it is
one of the worst movies ever made. To be fair, the visual effects are
stunning and the soundtrack is quite interesting. However, the point of
movies, after all, is to tell stories. The story in this is more
contrived that even most science fiction or fantasy. During the entire
movie, I did not care what happened, I did not care about the
characters and I did not particularly care if I got to the end. The
only reason I finished it was it was a movie link download and I wanted
to see if I was missing something. Oh yes, there were lots of
predicable boring explosions and lots of high tech gun fights. Bruce
Willis was OK, Gary Olman was camp. Its not really worth it to bother
with the rest. Save your time, go see something worthwhile or fun
