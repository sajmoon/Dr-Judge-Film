If you really like Sci-fi and Brucie Willis, you'd be better off watching
'12 Monkeys' - now that's a more memorable Sci-fi flick. This film lacked a
plausible story and the ending was simply atrocious! Reminiscent of James
Bond film endings. Truly one of the worst movies I've ever had to sit
through. Amazing that others gave it a 10! It's all in the eyes of the
beholder, I guess!
