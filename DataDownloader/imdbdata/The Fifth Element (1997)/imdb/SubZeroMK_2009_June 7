2009_June 7 
Seriously, this movie was very ahead of its time. I don&#x27;t know what
sprung in the director, but this movie was pure genius. There&#x27;s so much
originality in this and a lot of creativity. You know how when you
watch a James Cameron movie and at the end of it you&#x27;re like &#x22;holy
crap, this movie feels as if it came out this year&#x22;. Well, this is
exactly how I felt about this movie. It&#x27;s just like a James Cameron
movie, way ahead of its time, well, the 90&#x27;s.<br /><br />The city with the flying cars, floating Chinese take-out, and
cigarettes that have the filter backwards, I love this film! I can
watch this movie over and over again and it would still feel new to me.
Thanks to blu-ray technology, I can see it in beautiful high definition
followed by some nice surround sound system.<br /><br />The visuals and special effects were very amazing for a 90&#x27;s movie. And
this is 1997, you wouldn&#x27;t expect much from movies in the 90&#x27;s in terms
of nice special effects, with the exception of T2. But this movie
delivered on a massive scale.<br /><br />Gary Oldman is the villain. Not the brightest villain, but he&#x27;s cool.
We have cameo appearances from trip hop artist, Tricky, as Gary
Oldman&#x27;s sidekick I guess? Bruce Willis, one of my favorite actors
plays the role of the sarcastic action hero. He pairs up with the hot
and sexy Milla Jonovich. That scene where she was created by the
machines got me a little excited cause she&#x27;s just so sexy. Chris Tucker
is in it and he&#x27;s just such a goof. It&#x27;s kinda hard to tell whether
he&#x27;s straight or gay because of weird fashion the world of the Fifth
Element serves its citizens, but nonetheless, it fit the world, because
it needed something new.<br /><br />The plot is another save the world from the bad guy scenario, with a
twist. You have this deadly planet coming for earth, which looks like
an asteroid, but apparently the planet speaks because it&#x27;s alien, and
the main group of hero&#x27;s must gather all the stones which would be
placed in a temple in Egypt to stop the impending attack on earth. You
have a gang of mercenary-type aliens who can shape-shift into humans
and use any means of violence to accomplish their goals.<br /><br />The main group of hero&#x27;s are also joined by a priest by British actor,
Sir Ian Holm, who does a phenomenal job on his part. The worlds and
locations in this film are just stunning and beautiful, it&#x27;s like you
wish the world looked like that today, but sadly it doesn&#x27;t look
anything close to what the Fifth Element looked like.<br /><br />Overall, this movie gets a 10/10 for originality, creativity, and
stunning visuals. If you haven&#x27;t seen this, then you should, because
this should be on the list of movies you should watch before you die.
Buy this movie, it&#x27;s worth every penny. I look at other sci-films today
that involve a similar plot and I can&#x27;t enjoy it as much as I enjoyed
this movie. I wish the director had the ambition to make a sequel for
this, because it&#x27;s under-rated. Long live the Fifth Element.
