Let me begin by simply saying, &quot;I love this movie!&quot;  With a stellar cast
(Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, Ian Holm, the late Brion James, Chris Tucker,
and last, but never EVER least, Gary Oldman), a wonderful, action-packed,
funny story, with just the right amount of &quot;let's straighten up our act
before we wipe out mankind&quot; sermonizing, I never tire of this movie.  I've
probably seen it over 100 times and never fail to find some little gem that
I missed the time before, and the time before that, and so
on.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is at his best as the reluctant hero, a futuristic Joe Everyman
whose future is changed when a woman drops into his life and changes the
course of history.  Willis is always best when he's able to be his usual
wry, sarcastic self, and Luc Besson blesses us with a story which utilizes
this to it's full potential.  Milla Jovovich is delightfully innocent as our
supreme-being-in-the-making, Ian Holm is surprisingly funny as the priest,
and Chris Tucker is his usual screamingly hilarious self.  Before seeing
&quot;The Fifth Element&quot; for the first time in 1997 I was not familiar with any
of Chris Tucker's other work, so this was my first introduction to his
rapid-fire dialogue and campy hamming.  I cannot think of anyone else who
can talk as fast as he can and still be understandable.  And funny.  Gary
Oldman tops it all off with a generous helping of his patented creepy
villian, which I can never get enough of.<br /><br />Luc Besson's story is full of action, adventure, comedy, romance,
enough-but-not-too-much silliness, and just an all-around sense of fun.  The
only fault I did find with the entire movie was the mother of Bruce Willis'
character hounding him for no apparent reason.  What in the world was the
reason for this?  But it is only a minor distraction in an otherwise
fabulous movie.  <br /><br />I would recommend this *very* highly and give it a 10 out of 10 stars. 
Settle in and get ready for a highly entertaining and enjoyable
ride!
