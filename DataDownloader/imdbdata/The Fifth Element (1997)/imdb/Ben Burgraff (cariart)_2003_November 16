The story goes that director Luc Besson began writing THE FIFTH ELEMENT in
his teens, incorporating all the Sci-Fi elements he loved into one
over-the-top, grand space opera...sort of an &quot;E.E. 'Doc' Smith 'Skylark'
Meets Flash Gordon and Barbarella&quot; hybrid with sex, intergalactic action,
and even some pseudo-religious overtones tossed in...in other words, a
teenage daydream come true! Critics panned the end result for this very
reason, sneering at Bruce Willis' Earth-saving (yet again!) Korben Dallas,
and Besson's then-girlfriend, clothing-optional Milla Jovovich, as the
innocent demigod, Leeloo.<br /><br />The critics were wrong!<br /><br />THE FIFTH ELEMENT is, in the best sense of the word, a classic 'B' movie, a
space opera where a prologue vaguely similar to STARGATE leads to a future
Earth where traffic jams occur thirty stories above the ground, humanity is
ruled by beefy 'Tiny' Lister Jr., and where the Ultimate Evil is served by
everyone's favorite villain, Gary Oldman, sporting a Southern accent! If
this DOESN'T convince you that this is a 'popcorn' flick, not to be taken
too seriously, there is Chris Tucker, sporting a blond hairdo, as the
Galaxy's favorite media personality, promoting himself as he hits on his
adoring female fans; Ian Holm, as the monk who knows 'the Secret', forced,
despite himself, to become an active participant in the adventure; and some
of the most butt-ugly alien mercenaries you'll ever see, terrorizing a space
resort, until they meet their match in Bruce Willis' 'DIE HARD in Space'
protagonist! Yippee-Ki-Yay, indeed!<br /><br />The FX are astonishing, the comedy, broad and sly, the heroics, macho, and
as Leeloo, sent to save Earth, Jovovich manages to be both naive and sexy,
with broken English and a gymnast's grace.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is a joy, as always, to watch, and he carries the film with
charm and self-depreciating humor, whether dealing with endless phone calls
from his mother, driving his sky taxi recklessly (cabbies change very little
in the future!), taking on terrorists single-handed, or falling for the
exotic Leeloo. When he blows away a roomful of hostage-holding aliens, then
asks, &quot;Does anyone else want to negotiate?&quot;, you KNOW Besson picked the
right guy for the lead!<br /><br />If you want Profound Science Fiction, watch 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY
again...but if you want to kick back and just have fun, look not
further...THE FIFTH ELEMENT delivers!
