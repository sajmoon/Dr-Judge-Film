     I think what really hurt this film was the advertising campaign. It was
made to look like a serious science-fiction film. It's not. It's actually a
science-fiction *comedy* that's so over-the-top, I can't believe people are
trying to fault it for being something it isn't. On the level of gaudy,
self-referential camp it succeeds gloriously. Watch this one with the right
expectations and you ought to have a good time.
