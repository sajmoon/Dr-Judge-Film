2007_September 2 
One of my favourite movies, (I&#39;ve just watched it again this
evening)-this is such a fun, tongue in cheek, and, at times, total
&quot;piss take&quot; that should just be enjoyed for what it is-the more I see
it the better it gets. Wasn&#39;t sure if I liked the Chris Tucker role on
first viewing but now realise his comic element is a perfect balance
for the sometimes serious subject. This movie has it all: comedy,
sci-fi, suspense, thrills, adventure, drama, special effects and, most
importantly, romance. The music was so good, (particularly &#39;The Diva&#39;)
I bought the CD. A must see movie for anyone who doesn&#39;t take life too
seriously-don&#39;t watch if you like &#39;believable&#39; movies.
