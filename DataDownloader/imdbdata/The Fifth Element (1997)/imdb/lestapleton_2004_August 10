Bruce Willis and Gary Oldman were fabulous in their roles. Chris Tucker
turned in an over the top screamer of a performance as DJ Ruby Rhod,
the epitome of a 25th century metrosexual. Milla Jovovich was
convincing and sensually charming as Leeloo the surprise core
character. The rest of the cast including the background support roles
were wonderful. Sets were interesting and convincing. The special
effects were some of the best of the 90s. The sight gags were well
combined with the action. The staging of action sequences was carried
out masterfully. The element of Techno Opera was was one of the most
interesting vocal performances of the decade. Highly recommended with a
bottle of good wine.
