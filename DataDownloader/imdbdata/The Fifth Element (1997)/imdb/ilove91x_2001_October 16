Two words: Bruce Willis. He is at his best in this movie. It's hard to put
it into words. I first saw this movie just because a friend had it. I
started watching and was immediately intrigued. I couldn't stop watching it.
Milla Jovovich was great, and surprisingly, so was the story. I never
thought I would like it, but turns out I loved it. If you think you wouldn't
like it, give it a try, you just might love it!
