1999_August 10 

I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it!  Beautiful Milla
and
handsome Bruce set the movie bolting into the future wonderfully!
Amazingly
written by a high school student - it truly blew me away!  The kooky humor
and humorous characters are set well into the plot.  The story-line is
wonderful!  The music is great - perfectly written for the film!  This
truly
is a blast from the future!  This movie has become my favorite movie of
all
time.  I will probably have to buy a new movie soon because of being
worn-out from watching it over and over again!  I give it two big badda
boom
thumbs up!
