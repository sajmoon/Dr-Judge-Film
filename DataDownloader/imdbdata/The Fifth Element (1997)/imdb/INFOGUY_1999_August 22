1999_August 22 

This movie takes Blade Runner's science fiction vision to a new
level.
The director's view of the future is a sight for the sci-fi lovers eyes,
not
to mention the original feel of the movie.
This movie has a nice mix of comedy, special effects and
story.
I cannot tell you how many times I've watched it.
