1999_March 20 

This must be one of the best sci-fi movies since the days of Star Wars and
Dune. It is a superb story with all of the proper ingredients in it: humor,
action, love and thriller-sensation. The director, Luc Besson does a
formidable job and the script is also superb. Bruce Willis, starring in his
second sci-fi movie on a short time(the first was twelve monkies) delivers
as usual a very earthbound caracter with the basic ideals and a swift mouth.
Milla Jovovich shows that she is not only very pretty but also a talented
actress that I think everybody hopes to see on the screen again. And last,
but not least Mr Oldman who shows again what a brilliant actor he is, he
delivers the second most scary character he has ever made- nothing beats the
one in Besson's &quot;Leon&quot;. So I must say that I strongly recommend you to watch
this movie A.S.A.P. 9/10
