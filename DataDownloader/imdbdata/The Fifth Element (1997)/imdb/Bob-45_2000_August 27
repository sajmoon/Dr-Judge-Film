The most witty, colorful and original sci-fi film of the 1990s, THE FIFTH
ELEMENT literally paints the landscape with vivid
colors, costume design art directon, music, several wonderful
over-the-top performances (most notably Chris Tucker and
Gary
Oldman).  Only in the the romance element is the film a
little
weak.  There really isn't much chemistry between Bruce
Willis
and Mila Jovavich.  However, they are attractive and appealing.
The images from this film linger long after it ends, even
if
the plot does not.  Excellent direction and film editing.
Try it, you'll like it.
