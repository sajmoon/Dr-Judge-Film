The best future based movie ever.<br /><br />This movie is AWESOME!!!!! I saw this movie when i was about 4 and just
bought it a couple of days and have since watch at least 5 times.<br /><br />Bruce=great<br /><br />Milla=surprisingly hilarious <br /><br />Gary Oldman=different in this movie <br /><br />Chris Tucker=AWESOME!!!!! <br /><br />Set in the 23rd century, a retired major who is now a NYC taxi driver
called Korban Dallas is offered a mission to save the world.<br /><br />I recommend this to everyone. This kind of unique movie is not seen
every day. SEE IT NOW!!! <br /><br />10/10
