1999_October 13 

This is a uniquely exquisite film for so many reasons that I'll just to have
to mention them all. The way Luc Besson seemlessly threads elements of
science fiction, comedy, drama, action, romance and thriller genres is of
great credit to the man. Simultaneously, he sends us a strong message on the
value of life and tells us a cracking story.<br /><br />The look of the film is also spot on, with seemless special effects that are
visually stunning but blend seemlessly into the backdrop (the car chase is a
must see scene from the moment leeloo steps off the ledge) . Casting, too,
is excellent as Bruce Willis is one of the most talented and underrated
actors in Hollywood and sparks brilliantly with Milla Jovovich and
especially Chris Tucker.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this film, get it now. I mean right now.
