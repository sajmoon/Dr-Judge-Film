When I saw this movie on video, I thought,&quot;Wow!&quot;
The visuals were really good and the whole movie was enjoyable. Why was this
bagged out at the box office?
It was a whole lot of fun.
Just one complaint: I could not understand what the hell
Chris Tucker was saying!! Did anyone else feel this way
too?
