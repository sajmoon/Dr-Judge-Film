Call me juvenile, call me a typical male, but I loved this movie!!! Take a
hardened military man driving cabs for a living, throw in an ancient alien
evil threatening to destroy the universe, make the only key to stopping it a
hot redhead, and set it in the 23rd century!!! What have you got??? A
shoot-em-up feelgood movie with a sci-fi twist, a sure fire hit. Been done a
million times before, will be done another million!! Bravo to that, I say.
It will be a sad day when Bruce Willis stops starring in roles where he
shoots guns, makes wisecracks and ruins interpersonal relationships with any
females he encounters...My only criticisms of this movie is that it didn't
go for long enough, I could have watched it all day and that it doesn't have
a sequel!
