1998_September 8 

This has to be one of the best films I have ever seen. The effects and story
line were great ( okay, I admit a bit far fetched but if you open your mind
to it is superb ). Just another one of Luc Besson great line of movies.
This has to be one of Gary Oldmam best films, it is if Besson wrote this
role especially for him after 'Leon' and Milla Jovovich was just stunning
in it.
