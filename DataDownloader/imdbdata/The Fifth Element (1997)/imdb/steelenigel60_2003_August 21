Though I love Science Fiction, it surely must have more stinker movies
than
any other
genre, the most annoying kind of sci-fi stinker for me is the one that
poses
all over the
place and forgets to include a good story, i.e; The Fifth
Element.<br /><br />If you're a Luc Besson fan you'll doubtless love his obsession with style
over substance,
you'll love his 'hilarious' and 'quirky' character caricatures and you'll
go
all wet at the
'fabulous' over-the-top wackiness of his story situations. It's not that
I
can't like this
sort of stuff (the other kind of sci-fi stinker is the way too serious
one,
like The Phantom
Menace) but it's just the way Besson does it, self-consciously smirking
to
himself, I don't
know, maybe its just a French thing.<br /><br />There are good things here, the futuristic cityscape is beautiful, the
best
since that seen
in Bladerunner, and a colorful counterpoint to that film's gloomy vision.
Bruce Willis isn't
too bad here, doesn't stretch himself too much but does a decent job of
being the
straight man amongst all the crazy stuff.<br /><br />On the other hand, Gary Oldman hams wildly as the villain as usual, that
joke isn't funny
anymore, Chris Tucker - likewise. The beautiful but otherwise extremely
untalented
Milla Jovovich is in this movie too, arguably the worst female actress of
all time as she
again demonstrates here. Some of the design in this movie is great,
though
not some of
the wackier catwalk stuff by Jean Paul Gaultier and not the alien bad
guys
either, which
look and move not unlike turd-shaped hand-puppets.<br /><br />Avoid this one. 1/10.
