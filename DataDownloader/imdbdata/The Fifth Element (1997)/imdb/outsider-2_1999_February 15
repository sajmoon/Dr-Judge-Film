1999_February 15 

I'm glad I am watching this on tape - No stumbling around in the dark to
find my way out of a crowded theatre before a film is over.
This is a dreary and boring effort from Luc Besson, I was unable to find a
single redeeming characteristic. My interest was sparked when I saw Jean
Paul Gaultier's name in the credits but it looks like he didn't have any
great ideas either. His best work was probably for The cook, the
thief...<br /><br />My advice - rent Blade Runner (again) and be awed(again)
