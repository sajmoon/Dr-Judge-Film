1998_September 27 

The random and eclectic story made me almost believe that Terry Gilliam
directed this film.  I found the inter-cutting of parallel scenes interesting
at first, but grew tired of it as the technique was over-used throughout the
film.  Towards the end of the film, this cross-cutting became too much of a
nuisance to reaching the resolution of the film.  Also, I found the the third
act of the film to be overly contrived.  The urgency of reaching Egypt was
lost when Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) told the President that he would call
back in two hours, and, &quot;poof!&quot;, he arrived in Egypt.<br /><br />Bresson overtly stated improperly the fifth element.  From a classical Greek
standpoint, the four basic elements are earth, water, fire and wind, which
Bresson used correctly.  However, for the Greeks, the fifth element was the
&quot;heavens;&quot; all celestial bodies were composed of this uneartlhy
element.
