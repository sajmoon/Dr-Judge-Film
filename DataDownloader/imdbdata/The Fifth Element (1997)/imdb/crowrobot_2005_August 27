'The Fifth Element' is fun. That is the mindset one must get into to
enjoy this movie, and if you're not, you will hate it. Personally, I
didn't know what to expect. The critics were mixed on it, it flopped at
the box-office, but sci-fi fans (among them Harry Knowles) revere it. I
was blown away by the sheer entertainment value of this movie.<br /><br />The story is basic sci-fi mumbo jumbo, but who cares? Anytime you get
Bruce Willis and Gary Oldman in the same movie, I couldn't care less
about the plot. Bruce Willis once again does his tough-guy persona, and
he shows that he's still got the goods to kick butt and crack jokes.
Gary Oldman, in a strange idea, has a Texas drawl and he gives another
over-the-top bad guy performance (he also has the worst hairstyle known
to man). Ian Holm exudes dignity, Chris Tucker is annoying and funny at
the same time (scary), and Milla Jovovich kicks even more butt.<br /><br />The action ROCKS. I have not seen shootouts this cool in a long time.
The movie is cool, has a strange and colorful &quot;look&quot; to it, and it's
just a blast.
