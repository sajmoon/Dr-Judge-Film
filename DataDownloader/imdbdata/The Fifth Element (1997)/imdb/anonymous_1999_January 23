Luc Besson delivers another masterpiece.  I had no idea what to expect
before seeing this movie, but I was so impressed, I promptly proceeded to
watch the whole thing again.  This is not your average science fiction
movie.  While the effects and cinematography are simply amazing there is a
whole air of tongue in cheek throughout the movie.  Luc Besson is a one of a
kind director and knows exactly when to pan, fade and cut to the next scene
and I actually caught myself saying &quot;Wow, that's amazing&quot; at some points in
the movie.  The Music soundtrack is also worth the whole movie!  Now go and
see it!
