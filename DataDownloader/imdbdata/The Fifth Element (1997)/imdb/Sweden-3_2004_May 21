The best film I ever seen. It's so good that I can die for it! It also
have the best couple (double sens) of human in a film ever. Militza
Jovovich (Leeloo) &amp; Bruce Willis (Korben Dallas) makes the film even
better then the best one. For sure - it have it's weak point, but the
best with this move it that you love it the first time you see it, even
the first second and you love it in the hole movie and for the endless
of time. Even the dead loves it. And when I'm dead I can be a soul on
earth and watch Leeloo and Korben loves, in the same area (as me as a
married couple of course (even before the death take part)).<br /><br />Just not too good drama of all; not too good special effects ever for
that time. But the best drama in the world because of Militza Jovovich
&amp; Bruce Willis make it's to a film in the soul of death.
