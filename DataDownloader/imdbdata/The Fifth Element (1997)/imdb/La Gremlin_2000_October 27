I remember reading somewhere a very cynical review of &quot;the Matrix&quot; which
went something like this:  &quot;This is exactly what 'Blade Runner' would have
looked like if Ridley Scott was dropping acid.&quot;<br /><br />If that is true, then &quot;the Fifth Element&quot; is none other then &quot;the Matrix&quot; on
acid.<br /><br />And I mean that in the best way possible.<br /><br />Words cannot adequately describe the pottporri of mirth and mayhem that is
&quot;the Fifth Element&quot;.  All I can say is that I liked it and I reaccomend it. 
I am not even going to *try* to imply wether you'd like it or not.  Rent it
the next time you are in the mood for something completely off the wall,
very underrated, and visually inventive (a nicer way of saying trippy as all
hell).  And be prepared for sort of a &quot;Captain Planet&quot; flashback at the
finale.<br /><br />&quot;Father... are you *sure* she's the Supreme Being?&quot;
