This movie is grossly underrated, but I think that's because people went
into it expecting something entirely different from what they got.  They
went in expecting one of the following: a) Die Hard in space, b) Star Wars,
or c) Independence Day.<br /><br />The first group saw the movie as cluttered -- they were expecting a simple
action thriller where the hero is one person, *maybe* with a sidekick, and
plenty of villanous cannon-fodder.  What they got was a conflict between
multiple heroes with individual agendas who all basically wanted the same
thing but kept getting in each others' way.  The fast editing, wild visuals,
and bizarre costuming just made it look sillier.<br /><br />The second group saw it as small-minded -- they were expecting a
well-thought-out SF epic where an ancient evil must be defeated by an
ancient and nicely arcane good.  What they got was a farce where the
mystical rituals were nothing more than plot devices and ultimately the fate
of the universe rested on a bunch of self-centered idiots.  They were
disappointed when nobody explored the ancient Mondoshewan race, when the
hero only visited one other planet and then came straight back to Earth,
when the &quot;ancient evil&quot; had only a corporate executive as its lackey.<br /><br />The third group were expecting a repeat of the previous year's hugely
successful &quot;Independence Day.&quot;  They were expecting a massive invasion from
hideous creatures that would ultimately be repelled by an unlikely but very
plucky patriotic hero (or group of heroes) who boldly went out and saved the
world in its hour of need.  With a bit of wisecracking thrown in for comic
relief.  What they got was a hero who had to be *pestered* into saving the
world, a general disrespect for authority, incompetant villains, incompetant
heroes, and a general impression that the entire human race is a
laughingstock.  Worth saving, but still a laughingstock.<br /><br />What all these groups didn't realize going in was that this movie is French.
And this is *exactly* what French farce is all about.  It's comedy, it's
silly, it's surreal, it's not meant to be taken too seriously, and it is a
way to accept that life is priceless, although those who live life tend to
be quite ridiculous.  How do the French have a low crime rate *and* a
complete disrespect for authority?  This is how.  They don't really
disrespect authority.  They just find humor in it.<br /><br />And that's what this is about.  The world is about to end.  And it's
*funny*.  Really.  Not in the sense of your typical American situational
comedies, but rather in the sense of French farce.  That is to say, it's not
the situation that's funny -- the situation is the direst of all imaginable
tragedies.  What's funny is the fact that everybody acts like an idiot in
the face of it, from the military trying to take over despite having just
proven they have no idea what they're doing, to the permanently baffled
priest, to the government posturing uselessly away.  It's a good movie, but
you've got to understand that it's also a very silly movie.  Go into it with
a light heart and you'll enjoy.  Don't expect adrenalin or epics or
patriotism.  This is about the human condition, and how fundamentally
ridiculous it is.<br /><br />Plus, it's got a very good soprano.  I hated opera until I saw the scene
where Plaga Laguna, the alien Diva, sings her aria.  It's
beautiful.
