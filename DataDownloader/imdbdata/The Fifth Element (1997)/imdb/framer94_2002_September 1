2002_September 1 

This is one of the 3 movies that Luc Besson sent most of his life
plotting,
besides Leon, and Nikita.<br /><br />The story is set on eath in some 300 years hence, and involves a priest
and
a would-be 1000-and something year old supreme being (Milla Jovovich),
from
retreving 5 elements, which when alighened, will desroy a large
demonic-death star that will bring eternal evil to earth, if not stopped
within 48 hours...///along the lines, Gunh-Ho ex-military Jck-thel lad
Bruce
Willis gets mixed up in things, and trevels half-way across the solar
system
to get off with Milla Jovovich...<br /><br />The Bruce Willis' character plays kind of corny into the story, and is
typical of a an American low-base Superman hero. The story is very
predicatble and probably childish, but the film is unique for Luc Besson's
perception of science-fiction, and funny alien monsters, etc. His camera
work and direction is outstandingly unique and comparible to his other 2
well-known films. The costume and fashion designs are pretty orgional too,
along with garry Oldman's psychotic, and Chris Trucker's lady-king
preformances to take you on a roller coaster spins of action and
adventure.<br /><br />Overall, it's not bad for a watch, and can be watched again at regular
intervals of the year. Definately not one for the Oscars, but definately
one
of the best modern sci-fi's to date besides Men In Black and Star Wars.
