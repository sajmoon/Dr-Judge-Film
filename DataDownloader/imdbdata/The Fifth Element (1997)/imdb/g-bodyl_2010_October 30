I have been a big fan of science fiction and fantasy my whole life.
This is one of those I have not seen until now. I wish I saw it years
ago because it&#x27;s pretty darn good and my favorite actors, Willis and
Oldman are in it.<br /><br />This is about an ordinary taxi driver who ends up trying to save the
world along with a priest and an alien in a human girl that claims to
have knowledge about how to save the world.<br /><br />The acting here is great with one exception. That was Chris Tucker. He
was so annoying I just wanted to kill him. Other than that, I loved the
acting. Milla Jovovich is very good-looking in this movie.<br /><br />The special effects are great here. This is a visually astounding movie
as well.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun sci fi movie that I would want to see again. I
rate this movie 8/10.
