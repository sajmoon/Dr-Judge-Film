Enough has been said about this movie to make clear that it's one of those
love-it-or-hate-it type flics. I'll just note that though everyone calls
The
Fifth Element a &quot;sci-fi&quot; movie, it most certainly is not. Combine five
elements to drive back some evil force? Where's the science in this
premise?
Or most anywhere else, for that matter?<br /><br />2001:  A Space Odyssey was science fiction, of the highest caliber. The
entire plot was based on science, with a few extrascientific assumptions
made. Likewise Blade Runner. Several notches down, but still passable as
sci-fi, is Jurassic Park. In contrast with all these, TFE has nothing to do
with science; better to call it mythology or fantasy. Even on those terms,
though, it's rather uneven.<br /><br />5/10 (mostly on the strength of humor and special effects)
