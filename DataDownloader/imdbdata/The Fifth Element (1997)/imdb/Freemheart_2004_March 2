                If there's something beyond science is how a brainless movie
like this has been consider better than Battlefield Earth.
             The main idea is good but is treated in a way very shallow.
Bruce Willis is great as the action hero, but the rest of the characters are
horrible, a group pathetic of freaks in a battle to save the Earth with
something that they don't even understand. There's no drama, just a dead
intent to make comedy in a world created by the shallow mind of a famous
designer.
            Science Fiction mixed with the fashion world, can only work if
there's some respect for the deep side of the scifi (I mean some scientific
theme or logic concept), but in this case it's just a freak universe with
anything less a real piece of brain. 
             More than twenty years I been reading and watching science
fiction, but this is maybe the worst movie of scifi I have ever
seen.
