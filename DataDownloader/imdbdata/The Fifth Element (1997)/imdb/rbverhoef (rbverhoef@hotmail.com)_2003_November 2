There is so much entertainment in this movie it would be almost stupid
to write about its flaws. Especially the story is not the best thing
here, but who cares. I liked every scene, every moment in this movie.
The movie opens in Egypt, 1914, and we meet some strange creatures.
From here on we know this is not going to be a normal or very serious
sci-fi action movie. The creatures tell a priest that the stones are no
longer save on earth and they take some things. They tell the priest
they will return in 300 years, when evil arrives.<br /><br />300 years later. The strange creatures return but they are attacked by
other strange creatures. The only thing that survives is reconstructed
and turns out to be Lee Loo (Milla Jovovich). She is the fifth element,
the ultimate weapon against evil. Evil here looks like a great ball of
fire. Lee Loo escapes from the authorities, and in an astonishing shot
we see how a city looks like now. She jumps of a building and ends up
in the flying cab of Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis). He saves her from
the police, she asks for priest Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm), he brings
her there.<br /><br />We learn a little more about Lee Loo here. She needs four stones, the
four other elements, to save the world. The stones are on a vacation
resort where we meet DJ Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker). He has some funny
scenes as well. We have also met Zorg, who is played by Gary Oldman in
a great way. The attack on the strange creatures early in the movie was
planned by him. He wants the stones as well, he is offered a lot of
money for them. How the story develops from here I will not reveal.<br /><br />The story doesn't even matter. In every scene we have something to
like. Beautiful settings, great visual effects, Gary Oldman, the
beautiful Jovovich or the funny moments from Bruce Willis, Chris Tucker
and Ian Holm. May be this movie is not for everyone but if you don't
think to much you will definitely like it.
