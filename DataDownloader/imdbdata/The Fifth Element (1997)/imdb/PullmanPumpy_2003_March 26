    This was a big hit around the world, and looking at the IMDB voting, a
lot of people thought it was a good movie. But I detested it. I found its
mix of quasi-mumbo- jumbo ,futuristic bits and pieces ,aliens ,space ships
,Bruce Willis in unreformed 20th century mode,Gary Oldman being camp,loud
bangs and fistfights totally incomprehensible . 
Quite what happened to Ian Holms professor at the end totally lost me. One
minute he was ... no, I really cannot be bothered. Chris Tucker does a nice
Prince for the first two minutes of his performance (then had another thirty
minutes of prancing and preening) whilst Lee Evans does a nice twenty
seconds of Lee Evans and thats his lot. Milo Jovavich is gorgeous. Erm.
Thats it.
