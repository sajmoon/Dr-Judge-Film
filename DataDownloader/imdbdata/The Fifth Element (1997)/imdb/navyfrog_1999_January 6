1999_January 6 

Sure, this movie may not be everyone's piece of cake.  But as long as your
not looking for life-changing material, and you have an ounce of imagination,
I'd recommend this movie.  Bruce Willis offers a worthwhile performance
(lines are all about delivery, and he's one of the best).  Why do movies
who aren't deemed &quot;epic&quot; so frowned upon?  In today's world, there needs to
be more open minds and less of a strict definition of what is allowed to be
called worthwhile and what is not.  Everybody's opinion is different, so
those who slander this movie aren't necessarily right.  This is one movie
divided roughly 50/50 on the basic &quot;good or bad&quot; scale.  Watch it and decide
for yourself.
