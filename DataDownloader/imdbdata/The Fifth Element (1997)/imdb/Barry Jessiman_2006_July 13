A cracked and sometimes goofy movie with a great combination of music,
visually fabulous sets, and a lot of people acting out their
professional fantasies. Milla Jovovich is very attractive in a lead
role, and the Bruce Willis persona sits very nicely into this future
world. All the supporting actors overact with just the right amount of
panache. It was kind of like a high-speed ride on a bumpy road without
any sense you&#39;d ever crash. Fun.<br /><br />The ending is a bit Hollywood after a movie that doesn&#39;t really follow
any predictable patterns, but a happy ending was in the cards all
along. I just sat back and enjoyed the ride.
