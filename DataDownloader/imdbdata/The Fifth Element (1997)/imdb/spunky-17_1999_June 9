1999_June 9 

Don't get me wrong, I loved this film, but it was rather strange at times.
The scene on the airplane where Chris Rock pretty much rapes the
stewardess
is pretty odd, and didn't really fit in with the rest of the movie.  Still
it had some excellent action scenes and was a non-stop action film.  Eight
out of ten.
