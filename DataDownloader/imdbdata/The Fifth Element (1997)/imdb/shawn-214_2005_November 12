This movie starts off almost like an Indiana Jones adventure and it
covers all the things that make a great movie. Egypt, Space aliens,
beautiful women and action and adventure. All with a colorful cast of
characters. This movie is perfect for people about 13 and up as there
are some intense scenes. The characters in this movie are in some cases
larger then life but you really start to notice some of the hidden gems
when you watch it again. The future in this movie shows a huge blend of
technology and yet many of the things that make us comfortable today.
(Example, fast food, vacation spots and TV). The details in this movie
are fantastic and in my humble opinion its one of the best movies ever
made for pure movie fun and enjoyment.
