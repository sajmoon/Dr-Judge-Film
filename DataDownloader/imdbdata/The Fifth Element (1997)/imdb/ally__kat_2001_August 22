This film was, without a doubt, the worst sci-fi film I have ever seen &amp; i
was thoroughly disappointed with it.
Does Bruce Willis wear anything else other than white vests that get
progressively dirtier as the film goes on? (&amp; I know 'The Sixth Sense' is
an
exception)<br /><br />If its ever on TV again, don't stay up late to watch it - have an early
night instead!
