This movie is probably one of the best well-crafted films I have ever
seen.
It's visually stunning (just look at the vivid colors of the sets and
costumes and try to say otherwise), has great pacing and dialogue, and
(dare
I say?) pretty good acting.  But what about the plot?  I mean, that's
what
really holds the attention of the viewers, right?  Granted, it's not the
most normal story ever told, but then again, that's what makes it stand
out.
Why, as an American movie-going audience, be subject to the same old
cookie-cutter stories that we so often see?  Well that brings up my
point.<br /><br />Okay, so I've read the other user comments and I'm a little bit bothered.
Half the people really enjoyed this movie, and the other half...well,
they
fell on the opposite end of the spectrum.  I know I can't change what
those
people believe, but I think I know what the problem is: the majority of
the
movie-viewing public HATES anything out of the norm.  People saw Bruce
Willis's name on the poster and thought, &quot;Hey, another great
action/adventure movie starring my favorite action/adventure hero!&quot;
Well,
sorry...that's not what this is.  And that's why some people didn't like
it.
They went in expecting one thing, and were totally given the
opposite...and
it made them mad.  &quot;How dare they fool us!&quot; they would say as they
finished
watching the film.  &quot;This isn't what I expected!&quot;  Well, the thing is, if
more people would go into a film without preconceptions of how it should
be,
then they would enjoy it much more immensely.  Okay, now I'm getting off
my
soapbox.<br /><br />Now my major problem with the movie: the ending.  It seems that after
trying
to stay away from the norm and trying to give the audience something new
and
refreshing, Luc Besson felt that he needed a crutch to prop up the
ending,
basically using an old tried and true storybook resolution.  It kind of
dimmed in comparison with the rest of the film, but, oh well.  Let's just
say that The Matrix suffered from the same fate.  But despite this, I
believe the movie is strong enough to carry its own...9.5/10.0<br /><br />
