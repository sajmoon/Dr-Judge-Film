This is one of Bruce Wilis's best movies. This movie is awesome! For
those of you who haven't seen it should buy the DVD because it's a
movie you just gotta see if you love Sci-Fi movies. I have seen other
Sci-Fi movies. They are great! But &quot;The 5th Element&quot; is number 1 on the
list of top 5 favorite sci-fi movies for me. I think this movie should
have won an award for it. The acting, the sound effects, the visual
effects I give them 10 stars! Overall everything about the movie gets
10 stars. If your a fan of Bruce Wilis and you love Sci-Fi movies then
this is the movie for you! I give this movie 2 thumbs up. On a scale of
1-10 I give it a 10 for it's excellency and overall movie performance.
