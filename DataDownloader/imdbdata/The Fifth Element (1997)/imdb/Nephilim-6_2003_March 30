I read a lot of reviews about this movie before purchasing it and it seemed
cool. But after watching it I was disappointed. Not to say it was bad, It
was entertaining and better than most hollywood trash, but still I was
disappointed. I was expecting something like the magnificent Blade Runner
but no... What I got was something with lots of bright colors and
humor...
And I just don't like that. I like my scifi movies bleak and devoid of hope
but this just didn't cut it for me.<br /><br />But like I said I found it entertaining. It's not like your typical
hollywood trash. Interesting sets and characters and story. (Although very
Wicca. Fifth Element being love? Been there done that).
And the ever gorgeous Milla. She did a brilliant job acting. I kept
wondering if the language she spoke was a real one.. Can anyone enlighten
me?
Anyway, okay movie but not up to par with the afore mentioned Blade Runner.
Even though I felt it was trying to achieve that vision of the
future.
