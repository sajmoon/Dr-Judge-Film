1999_May 14 

When I started watching the Fifth Element, I was impressed with the
imaginative effects and setting.  But as the movie progressed, it became
more and more cartoonish and obnoxious.  Mila Jovovich is way, way, way
too
cutesie for the importance of her character to the story and Chris Tucker
serves absolutely no purpose at all.  And the ending is so artificial that
I
almost vomited.  It's one of those &quot;love conquers all&quot; deals, but it's
seemingly thrown together at the last minute.  The Fifth Element had
promise, but threw it all away.
