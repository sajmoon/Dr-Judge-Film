1999_January 10 

Showing you how fun saving the world can be is judged by having a chance to
see THE FIFTH ELEMENT. It's a wild fantasy ride 300 years into the future
that makes this one enjoyably satisfying, but the imagination gets clearly
overstated by making itself too obnoxious. Of course, the visuals are as
good as any recent sci-fi outing and there is some appropriate meaning about
a female life-form while staying alive to prevent the end of the world from
coming. The big beef is that its futuristic setting gets over-exaggerated
for its strange behavior. Part of this factor is Chris Tucker, who is
downright annoying as a radio freak on hyperwarp. I like how science fiction
is vigorously refined for the 90s and beyond. I wish the film crews and
directors would find better alternatives in not forging over the top on
excess junk material. Pray that STAR WARS - EPISODE ONE doesn't fall into
the sleaze trap where STARSHIP TROOPERS and this film landed in.<br /><br />Sony, your formula is greatly showing. Keep it up, or we'll run your godd--n
studio like a bunch of professionally trained business execs who want to
discuss a corporate takeover!
