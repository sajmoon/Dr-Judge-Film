** 1/2 out of ****<br /><br />The Fifth Element may very well be the most elaborate, visually
magnificent
film I've ever seen. Everything, from the spaceships to the flying cars to
the city, is an example of eye-popping special effects. For that alone, I
would recommend it. There are several other things going for it, too,
though
I can't forget the fact that the story is a mess and many individual
scenes
are annoying and headache-inducing. Hey, everything comes with a price,
and
these visuals are no different.<br /><br />In terms of plot, let's just say the film takes place a few hundred years
in
the future, and Bruce Willis is the hero who must save the Earth before a
huge ball of evil will destroy it. To do so, Willis needs the help of the
fifth element, turns out its Milla Jovovich. Impeding the good guys are a
band of ugly aliens and an over-the-top Gary Oldman as a nasty businessman
named Zorg.<br /><br />There are a lot of little things about The Fifth Element that bug me.
First
is Zorg's motivations. Apparently, he's been chosen by that big ball of
evil
to hinder Willis and Jovovich, and he cooperates seemingly because he
believes in a big financial pay-off. Exactly what he can do with any
riches
after the Earth is destroyed raises more than a few questions. Basically,
Oldman's just here to chew the scenery and give us a human villain, even
though in the end, he isn't particularly menacing and never even comes
face-to-face with Willis.<br /><br />Rather, the villains who participate in the physical action are a group of
really ugly aliens (whose names I can't think of at the moment) that have
the ability to shapeshift. These aliens look really silly, but I'll give
director Luc Besson the benefit of the doubt and assume the effect was
entirely intentional. Even then, they don't make for very imposing
antagonists, they're almost as easy to kill as storm troopers, and they're
only slightly more competent.<br /><br />But such flaws are made up for by not only the movie's great look, but its
sense of fun. At its heart, The Fifth Element is not science fiction but a
comical action/adventure with mismatched heroes, a &quot;damsel in distress&quot;,
and
bad guys who threaten the world itself. Bruce Willis makes for a great
deadpan hero, and as usual, excels during the action sequences. Jovovich
isn't quite my idea of the perfect being, but she's acceptable in her
role.
Almost taking me out of the movie is an annoying Chris Tucker as an
androgynous DJ. He's here as comic relief, and while he gets off a few
good
laughs, he's more of a detriment than anything else.<br /><br />Surprisingly enough, even though The Fifth Element moves at a fast pace,
there are only a few all-out action scenes. Aside from a flying car chase
(which Star Wars Episode II obviously took inspiration from) and a big
climactic gun battle, there's not a whole lot of physical violence going
on
here, at least not when compared to some of the other sci-fi action films
released around the same time (Star Trek: First Contact, Alien
Resurrection,
Starship Troopers).<br /><br />Keeping the film consistently enjoyable is Besson's sense of humor. He
knows
well enough not to take such a story seriously, so don't be surprised by
how
much the movie acknowledges its own silliness. I've not seen a whole lot
from Besson that I liked (I always found The Professional overrated and
The
Messenger a bloated, though not entirely unenjoyable, mess), but The Fifth
Element comes the closest to a movie of his that I genuinely liked.
There's
much from this movie I enjoyed and I do recommend it, but cut off the
chaff,
and we could've had a sci-fi/action classic on our hands and not just a
good
timewaster.
