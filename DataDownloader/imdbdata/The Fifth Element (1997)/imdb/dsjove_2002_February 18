The Fifth Element was a wonderful surprise. My wife and I walked
into the theater to view a movie with no expectations. There were
very little advertisements. The story, the action, and the comedy
were very enjoyable; all the more so because they were not ruined
by previews.<br /><br />The script writers did not feel it necessary to insult the audiences
intelligence by explaining every situation.<br /><br />Chris Tucker got a little annoying, Milla is HOT, what's up with
Luke Perry even being credited, and Gary Oldman, of course, plays
a delightfully psychotic villain.<br /><br />If nothing else the final fight scene is a must see/hear.
