This is a movie that had heaps of special affects and make it special. Cool
monsters and beings make this movie a must. Bruce Willis is at his best in
the film and Luc Besson did an outstanding job. It would be good to see
another movie like this because it easily is one of the movies that take the
chocolates for special affects.<br /><br />97%
