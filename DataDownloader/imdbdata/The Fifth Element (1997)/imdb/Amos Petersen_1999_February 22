1999_February 22 

My roommate owns a copy of this film and I've seen it three or four times
over the last year.  There are definitely some well done scenes (nearly
every one centered around Milla) and some excruciating ones, like every
freaking second the President is on.  And what the hell is Tricky doing?
There is a strange mix of talent and crap throughout the whole film that
made me wish they had cast some better character actors, but taken
altogether, Milla Jovovich and Bruce Willis managed to keep me interested
enough to want to see it again.  The more I watch it, the easier it is to
overlook the discrepancies...
