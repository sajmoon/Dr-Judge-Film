1999_July 5 

This movie is just amazing, it's definitely one of the best movies I've
seen
in a LONG time. The special effects were just amazing and the acting was
above average. Luc Besson's image of a futuristic world are so realistic
that you feel you are actually there. He has made a movie just as good (or
maybe even better) than his last movie 'Leon'. I whole-heartedly recommend
that you watch this movie if you get a chance. Simply amazing.
