Why does everybody think this movie is so bad?! If you think there are plot
holes PAY ATTENTION, the story is *so* good when you understand it. Sure,
maybe the director lost control of the story for a while there, but as a
whole the movie is SO GOOD! Milla Jovovich does such a great job (not to
mention Bruce Willis...). But one thing...this movie would be perfect if it
weren't for that SUPER ANNOYING Ruby Rod character (sorry
Chris)...
(9/10)
