Gary Oldman - you mad dog, this is Gary at his very best, playing the
bad guy and playing it well. Bruce Willis steps into the future like
walking from his upstate NY apartment on any given morning. Mila
Jovovich is absolutely stunning and will blow you away. Chris Tucker
brings the comedy element into the tense proceedings whilst the
surprise pop up of FOG (Lee Evans)is not to be overlooked. Set in a
believable future world at the mercy of evil, (Could be 2010 onwards)
this roller coaster movie takes hold from the start and doesn&#x27;t let go
until the credits roll. Excellent alien creatures and whether opera is
your thing or not, the piece performed by the uncredited Kristen
Fick(The Diva) made my hairs stand on end. i enjoyed this film and I
would rarely give a film full marks but this film scores 10/10 for me .
. Enjoy!
