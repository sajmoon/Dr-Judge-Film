You will sit on the edge of your seat from the very beginning either
biting nails, laughing or crying (at the end).<br /><br />The plot is simple. The story line is well implemented. Characters are
easily understood. <br /><br />The production and special effects are very skillfully done. In fact,
some scenes are downright slick and the mechanics so believable...like
in the scene where the Chinese &quot;bring out&quot; boat departs from Dallas&#39;s
apartment.<br /><br />For an action movie, it&#39;s one of the best ever made. Up there ringing
the bells with Die Hard and Predator.<br /><br />Bruce is so devastatingly cute in this movie and hands down this role
is just perfect for Jovovich. <br /><br />Depending on your sex preference you will fall in love with one of
these two characters.<br /><br />Chris Tucker is sooo funny. One of his best performances.
