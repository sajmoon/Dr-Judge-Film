Bruce Willis in Jean-Paul Gaultier outfit saving the universe and life as
we
know it from an undisclosed evil that has teamed up with over-the-top
madman
Zorg &quot;I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED !!&quot;, played with gusto by Gary Oldman. How???
Who cares in a world designed by the imagination of Besson, acclaimed anime
artist Moebius and JPG. Needless to say, it's style over substance here.
But
with great attention to detail, check out the filter on the cigarette that
Bruce smokes in the beginning of the film.<br /><br />Not for everyone though, but put your mind on 'dim' before you watch this
film and you'll have a great time. In a way it's like that other Willis
vehicle, 'Hudson Hawk', don't take it too serious -do not rationalize the
gaps in the plot- just enjoy a weird and wonderful world. If only Besson
would have considered to take Jean Reno for the lead...<br /><br />
