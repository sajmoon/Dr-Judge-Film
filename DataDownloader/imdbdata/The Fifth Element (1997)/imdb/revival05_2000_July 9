Well, THE FIFTH ELEMENT is a movie by Luc Besson. Only that is a big
expectation. However, THE FIFTH ELEMENT has got the same problem as even
more overrated THE MATRIX. It has got effects of all kind, but nothing more.
From that, it's empty. I saw this movie at it's release and didn't like it.
I've seen it again, and I still don't like it. I've also kind of &quot;imagined&quot;
the effects away, and found a big hole. <br /><br />The acting is terrible. Except for Gary Oldman, who were hysteric and
hilarious and Ian Holm, God he's great! Even though, I can't believe what
he's doing in this trash. He's a quality-actor for God's sake! Well now.
Bruce Willis was ok, but poor Milla what-ever-her-name-is was totaly
awful.<br /><br />I believe Chris Rock, oh, I mean Chris Tucker (they are like twins) is in
this movie. Seeing him, and thinking that it's really a movie by Luc Besson,
who's got style, is sickening. This movie is plastic, folks! Not the usual
Besson-style as in &quot;Nikita&quot;, &quot;Leon&quot; and &quot;Le grand bleu&quot;.<br /><br />Besson's worst. 6/10 (and a six is pretty poor for a movie like this)
