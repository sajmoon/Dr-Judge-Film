In the wonderfully sci-fi movie &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;, Leeloo (Milla
Jovovich), an alien, faces the challenge of saving the human race. She
has been reconstructed from an arm of an alien&#39;s destroyed body. The
alien was traveling to save Earth from enclosing danger, when it was
fired upon and killed. Leeloo is the fifth element, the &quot;ultimate
weapon against evil&quot;, the only hope Earth has. On her journey, Leeloo
encounters many different people. Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) becomes
entangled with the mission when Leeloo literally falls into his cab. He
is portrayed as a hero along with Leeloo. They need to retrieve the
&quot;stones&quot; before the antagonist of the story, Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg
(Gary Oldman), gets his greasy hands on them and destroys all mankind.
Leeloo goes through a very personal challenge near the end of the
movie. After being shot at and attacked she realises humans have a
nasty side that she doesn&#39;t understand. She looks up &quot;war&quot; on the
internet and is horrified by the images that come up. She has been sent
to Earth to protect this race that partial to destruction. She doubts
her mission until Korben explains love to her and that no matter how
little of it there is, love is worth protecting.<br /><br />I love this movie and the challenges Leeloo faces. It is humorous in
it&#39;s delivery of an important message and I think it&#39;s extremely
effective.
