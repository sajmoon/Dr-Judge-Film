No, I really was not disappointed.  The Fifth Element has it all:  drama,
comedy, romance, a fast-paced plot, and great characters.  Chris Tucker is
laugh-out-loud funny as the dim-witted, vain Ruby Rhod.  Gary Oldman is
deliciously sinister as Zorg.  And Bruce Willis is sarcastic and gritty as
our hero, Korben Dallas.  The film is set in a mind-boggling future with
body rebuilding, interstellar travel, and, of course, flying cars.  The
plot
(to make it short: defeat the bad guy, use the weapon against evil, save
the
world) is quick and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  If you have the
misfortune of being someone who has not seen this film, I would reccommend
that you go rent it.
