Possibly the worst movie of all time.  I have no words to convey how
painful
it was to watch this movie.  The story was disjointed, the characters
ranged
from stereotypes to caricatures to offensive.  The action was comic at
best,
and the 'lighter' moments were so staged/forced that they only added more
misery to this abomination.
