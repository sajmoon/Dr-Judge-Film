&#x22;A movie only an art director would love&#x22; is how I&#x27;m teased for this. I
openly and unregretably love this movie.<br /><br />To the point if I ever bear a female child, her name is Leeloo Dallas
(Multipass) Egnot: I&#x27;m seriously married to an Egnot. Should that be
twins (it&#x27;s totally possible given my family record), the second is
Milla Jo.<br /><br />I love this movie that much. The names to me mean &#x22;Love&#x22;.<br /><br />&#x22;So good to hear from you, Egnot.&#x22; How did you come up with that?! I&#x27;m
married to the LAST MALE I know of with the name?! As an artist, the
sets are done by an artist I respect, the costumes by a designer I
respect, the acting nothing but people I respect.<br /><br />This is a GEEK love, which is hard to come by. I appreciate a bone once
a while. Dorks unite!
