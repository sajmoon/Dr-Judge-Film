Maybe The Fifth Element is not as good as previous Besson's films but it is
still a world class movie.It is possible that you won't like it,but it's
quite normal.The Fifth Element has everything that a good
(OK-commercial) film should have:not the worst script,good music,special FX
and especially actors.You may not agree but i think that Bruce and company
really worked hard for their money.My mark is 9 since the film could be a
bit better and I was quite disappointed with the ending...
