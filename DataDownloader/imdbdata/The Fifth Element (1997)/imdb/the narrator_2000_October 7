This has got to be one of the most vivid and colorful movies of all time. It
doesn't make much sense, but the visuals, costumes and music will have you
distracted for the duration. The idea was thought up by Luc Besson when he
was a teenager, and this is a teenagers dream. Complete with aliens,
gunplay, flying car chases, this is a movie that's impossible not to enjoy.
The plot, about a woman called Leeloo (Played excellently by Milla Jovovich)
who holds the key to the future (or something like that, is a bit confusing,
but it's the perfect set-up for a visually stunning and innovative thrill
ride through the 23rd century. Bruce Willis plays his typical wisecracking
character, and Gary Oldman is in great, over-the-top form as the villain
with (who else?), but the only person who lets the movie down is Chris
Tucker, giving the most annoying (But sometimes irritatingly funny)
performance in Hollywood history. Altogether, an amazing feast for the eyes.
8/10.
