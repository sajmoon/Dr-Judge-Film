This Movie has great action, comedy, and special effects. Bruce Willis has
done a good job and looks absolutely Gorgeous in this Movie. So does Milla
Jovavich. I thought Chris Tucker was hilarious. My friend and I couldn't
stop laughing everytime he said zzzzz! It's a Movie worth watching,
although
I feel that it would view better in the theatre.
