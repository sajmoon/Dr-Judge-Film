1999_June 15 

Yesterday I saw this movie on DVD and I am still excited about it. Very
spectacular and a lot of different acts.
And then suddenly the opera aria.
I think if people say they dont like the opera, just see the film and you
love it.
A great movie and I am gonna see it a lot of times. I am sure of
that.
