Out of the reviews and comments I've read for this movie, not a single
person mentioned Tricky. I'm not sure exactly what tricky's character was
officially called, but you will remember him as Gary Oldman's Right Hand
Man.
As Tricky, Milla, and even Lee Evans (if ever so briefly) grace the 5th
Element, I see no reason not to watch it. Sure bruce willis, doesn't come
to
mind as the &quot;hero&quot; if you were pitched 5th's premise. However his
supporting
cast more then make up for his sterotyped acting.<br /><br />I especially like the cinematography, even more specific, the use of
color contrasts. One one hand you have a movie like Payback, using darker
shades, and bright white contrasts. Here you have focus on colors. Each
color is brought out in a comic bookish anime setting.<br /><br />5th is a damn good movie..replayability may be on the lower side, but
hey, it's got TRICKY DAMNIT!!!!
