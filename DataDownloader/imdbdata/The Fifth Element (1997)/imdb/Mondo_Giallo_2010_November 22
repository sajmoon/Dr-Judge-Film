I think you&#x27;ve got to forget the story when attempting to appreciate
the merits of The Fifth Element. Its narrative is really a load of
nonsense. What makes this film interesting is its aesthetics. Luc
Besson has always been a director famed for his stylish action films,
and this one is no exception. The only major difference of course is
that this is science-fiction, and it is unusual to see such a
big-budget film of that genre coming out of Europe. Its French origins
do show too, with its elegantly attired characters and slightly strange
sense of humour. It isn&#x27;t a film without faults though, as its story
about love against evil isn&#x27;t exactly a strong point.<br /><br />But in terms of imaginative design, The Fifth Element is definitely a
success. The streets of the future metropolis are full of life and
crazed visual ideas. Bright primary colours abound everywhere and the
overall look is certainly very well-conceived. I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily
say that this extends to the characters, as none of them are especially
memorable. Even Milla Jovovich in the central role of Leeloo isn&#x27;t all
that well utilized in my opinion. She only gets to flex her muscles on
the rarest of occasions and is in the main just a victim to be
protected. Bruce Willis is of course her saviour, with Gary Oldman
pitching in with a strange accented villain. For me the best character
was the alien opera singer, her scene where she sings an aria while
Leeloo engages in a fight with the bad guys is definitely the highlight
of the movie.<br /><br />The tone of the film is almost that of a comedy. This is not a film
that is taking itself in the least bit seriously. This playfulness of
approach may be perhaps a bit jarring to some and might take a bit of
getting used to. I guess though because of this it&#x27;s easier to ignore
the deficiencies in the story-line department. The Fifth Element is a
silly but beautifully presented science fiction action flick and is
recommended for those who gravitate to the quirkier side of the genre.
