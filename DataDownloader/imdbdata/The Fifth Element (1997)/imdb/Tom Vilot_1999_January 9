1999_January 9 

This was an abysmal film.<br /><br />I'm glad I saw it in a second-run theater, where it cost me all of two
dollars to barely hang through.<br /><br />This isn't s.f., it's not fantasy, the action is unconvincing, and it's not
very funny. I can't object too much to Bruce Willis' effort in this film,
even though I can not praise it either. But that god-forsaken Ruby Rhod
character is beyond annoying. I actually might have been able to enjoy the
camp design of this flick had that character been completely omitted. The
childish sexual innuendo and flamboyant flaming homosexuality of Rhod was
tiresome after the first five minutes.<br /><br />I was saddened to see Ian Holm in this film. It belittled his performance as
Mr. Kurtzman in Terry Gilliam's &quot;Brazil.&quot;<br /><br />It's no wonder the French like Jerry Lewis. Skip it, unless you're really
into juvenile humor.
