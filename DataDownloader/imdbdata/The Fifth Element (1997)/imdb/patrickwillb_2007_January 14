I&#39;m not saying this is a ten but I think it was a great movie that no
one bothered with so I give it a ten to bring it up. The attention to
sci-fi detail is ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING and Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman,
Milla Jovovich, and Chris Tucker were also terrific. It is an ACTION
drama/comedy and some people have a hard time with that because they
expect Star Wars. It isn&#39;t Star Wars. It&#39;s Shawn of the Dead meets Sci
Fi, funny but serious and poignant. An attention to detail really sets
a good sci-fi apart from the bad and if you watch this you will know
the difference. Combine this with the Die Hard Comedy of Bruce Willis
and you have a must watch movie if not one to own.
