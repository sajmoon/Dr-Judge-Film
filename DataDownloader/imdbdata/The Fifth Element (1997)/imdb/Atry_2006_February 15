I&#39;ll be the first to say it, this movie is no Star Wars, and that&#39;s why
some people were disappointed. They came here expecting a masterpiece,
but its more like one of those Sci-Fi Anime&#39;s. Its over the top,
unbelievable, got a atrocious plot, but you just can&#39;t help loving it!!<br /><br />Lonely cabby Korban Dallas (Willis) is surprised when an alien
(Jovovich) falls through the roof of his taxi. But is even more shocked
when he finds out she is a cosmic weapon which needs to be activated or
the world will end. So he, priest Vito Cornelius (Holm) and radio
presenter Ruby Rhod (Tucker) set out to fine the five elements and save
the planet, all the time with evil Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg (Oldman)
on their heels.<br /><br />Honestly, This is the last place I&#39;d expect to find Bruce Willis, the
Die Hard tough guy playing a confused, ordinary guy when an alien just
drops into his life (quite literally) and admittedly not is his best
work. But he still plays the part reasonably well. Ian Holme is funny
as the bumbling priest, Milla Jovovich pulls off what could be a
laughable part (baby language and all.) Chris Tucker&#39;s the main
problem, he&#39;s just annoying. But its Gary Oldman who steals the show,
he is brilliant as the evil Zorg. The way he delivers some of his line
is hilarious, and his timing is always perfect.<br /><br />Brilliant use of cheesy FX and brilliant colour make this into a form
of live-animation comic book, it&#39;s just fun to generally look at, and
the cheesy rubber-aliens are cool too!<br /><br />8/10
