Mediocre storyline, very good acting, wonderful singing voice. The Fifth
Eelement keeps you riveted to the edge of your seat with action packed
scenes throughout the movie while bringing a grace and elegance amidst
the chaos with a singing voice equal only to Sarah Brighton. Throw in
the comedic genius of Chris Tucker and the Fifth Element is everything
you could possibly want in a movie. Bruce Willis is his ever charming
grumpy old self. He plays that role very well. <br /><br />Did I mention that the Blue Lady can sing with a powerful yet
wonderfully melodic voice? OK, so it's part the marvel of high tech
movie making, still, what a voice.<br /><br />If you get what you pay for, then you definitely get your money's worth
with the Fifth Element.
