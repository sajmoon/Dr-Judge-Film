1999_April 22 

What can I say about this film? Well, for starters, IT WAS GREAT! Of course,
there were some plot holes and things that could've been left out the final
cut, but it was just too good to let little things get out of the way. This
movie still is a great topic of conversation between friends and
myself.<br /><br />The special effects were something to look at. Dozens of flying cars zooming
by in traffic hell, and when Willis dives through them it's just
spectacular. It was the best mid-air car chase I'd ever seen, and the scene
where Leeloo is reconstructed from just DNA was an excellent way to
introduce a main character.<br /><br />And for the record, for all those people who think Chris Tucker's character
(Ruby Rode) was gay, I want to say that he wasn't. I would guess that Besson
was thinking of how so many things would change in 3 hundred years. Just
think now. There were no computers in the 1800's. Hell, there wasn't even a
telephone (I don't think, but if there was it wasn't touch-tone).<br /><br />The haircuts were weird. So were the clothes. So were the rooms inside the
apartments. But this came from the mind of a 13 year-old French boy in
boarding school and revised into a movie. Besson's got a good and creative
imagination. And if he is really helming the Tomb Raider movie, I'm sure
it'll just add to the list.
