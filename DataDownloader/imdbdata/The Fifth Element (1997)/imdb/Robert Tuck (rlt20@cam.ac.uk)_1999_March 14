1999_March 14 

I saw this at the cinema when it first came out, but the memory is still
fresh as the day I watched it. This is the first review I write, as a public
service to those who may be thinking about seeing it. Unless you really like
flashy sci-fi films regardless of content, then avoid. Like the
plague.
To its credit, Luc Besson has done a spectacular job with the effects and
costume. At the start, at Bruce Willis' apartment, there were some good
Blade Runner-ish moments, but they are really wasted on this
film.
Oh, and the ending is really tacky.
The film lacks any kind of plot direction, half the time I was wondering
what the whole point was. Ian Holm tries his best to do Cadfael, but doesn't
really convince. Bruce Willis puts a good effort in too however this is not
to be his finest hour.
In the end I just found the storyline to be tacky and irritating. The
costumes just got more and more bizarre (golden ducks and a blue lycra male
diva anyone?).
Luc Besson has done far better films (Nikita, Leon) and you should see these
instead - he must have been on some weird trip to concoct
this.
