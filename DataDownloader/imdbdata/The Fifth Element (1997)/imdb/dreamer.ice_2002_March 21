Director Luc Besson manages it to blend action, comedy, romance and sci-fi
into one, absolutely fantastic, masterpiece. Just about everything about
this movie is perfect, good examples being the music and the special
effects. The story and screenplay are very believable and make you forget
that you are just watching a movie.
