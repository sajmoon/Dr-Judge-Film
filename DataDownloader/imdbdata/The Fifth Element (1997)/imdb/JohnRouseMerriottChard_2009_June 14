It&#x27;s 2259 and the Earth is in mortal danger from pure evil. The only
hope Earth has is something called the fifth element, which comes in
the form of the newly cloned Leeloo. Along with an ex forces cab driver
and a priest called Cornellius, Leeloo must piece it together before
the end of mankind arrives.<br /><br />Depending on which side of the fence you sit on, The Fifth Element is
either a child fantasy made by an adult, or an adult fantasy made by a
child! Here in lays the problem that many critics and movie watchers
can&#x27;t agree on. Just what does Luc Besson&#x27;s film want to be? Having
conceived the concept for his film at a very easily age, Besson I think
waited until he was comfortable with his adult eyes, and armed with the
technological advancements in the late 90s, to realise his vision. With
the result being a beautiful piece of science fiction that is, yes-
cartoonish in every other frame.<br /><br />Crucial tho is that Besson&#x27;s futuristic vision of New York dominates
proceedings, not even a villain overdrive from Gary Oldman can detract
from the colourful vistas that Besson has crafted. The sea has dropped
and New York is awash with flying cars, there are no take away&#x27;s
anymore, the Chinese junks fly to your front door to serve you food,
how cool is that? Shape shifting aliens are amongst us, who in the
context of this Jean-Paul Gautier clothed universe, blend in
effortlessly, and opera divas are strangely beautiful and blue
creatures. In short, the film is an art direction treat, a feast for
the eyes, even as the comedy and action take control in the final
third.<br /><br />Bruce Willis quickly leaves behind his successful trip to harder edged
roles {Twelve Monkeys}, to play super cabbie Korben Dallas. Gun toting
and with a quip at every turn, this is the Willis that the MTV
generation loves and adores. Oldman, for better or worse as Zorg, gives
a memorable performance {oh my, is that a Southern American accent?},
but it&#x27;s with Mila Jovovich {Leeloo} that the film gets its acting
spurs. A pure revelation, it begs the question on why Jovovich has
failed to progress in the acting world? {stop doing tripe like Resident
&#x22;will work for food&#x22; Evil films would be a good start}.<br /><br />Sci-fi fans will obviously get the point that the support cast features
Ian Holm {Alien} and Brion James {Blade Runner}, which off sets the
annoying and painful turn from Chris Tucker as zany, insecure DJ Ruby
Rhod {is Besson having a pop at world DJs here I wonder?}. To leave us
with what? A film that mildly suffers from its director giving way to
his heart over his head, but hey baby, it&#x27;s one groovy and enjoyable
romp from start to finish regardless. 8/10
