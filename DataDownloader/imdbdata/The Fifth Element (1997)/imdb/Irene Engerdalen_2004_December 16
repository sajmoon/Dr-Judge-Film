Gary Oldman steals the show as the evil Zorg, and gives new life to an
old saying: If you want something done, do it yourself. Jovovich shows
that she has an acting talent(not just a pretty face), when she shows
vulnerability as well as toughness in a convincing way. Bruce Willis
shows himself as his more or less usual character, but in this movie it
works. And the story is indeed remarkably good. It has the spices of a
little &quot;fantasy-history&quot;, a superhero which for once is a woman and the
always money making end of the earth. But it is rarely well sewn
together. As one might fear in an event like this, the authorities
tries to take the show to the extent that it nearly causes disaster.
very well acting on all parts, and a story for all lovers of fantasy or
sci-fi. A movie I can watch over and over.
