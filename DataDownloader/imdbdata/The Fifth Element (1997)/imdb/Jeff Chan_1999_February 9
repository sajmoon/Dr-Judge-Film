1999_February 9 

A fun, very imaginative, visually stunning movie.  No it's not 2001 (what
movie with Bruce Willis could be?).  It *is* highly entertaining, great
movie-making.<br /><br />The Fifth Element's humor is funny, action strong, visuals great.  But what
raises it above the average action flick is the clever science fiction of
3-D &quot;car&quot; traffic, ultimate space saver apartments, cool future weapons,
10,000 foot Manhattan skyscrapers, warping space ships, and alien worlds
together with human elements like labor strikes, rasta nuclear fuel workers,
and love as a reason for existence.  These themes pour from the soul of
writer/director Luc Besson (of Nikita fame) yielding a rich tapestry for our
characters to inhabit.  This is one person's vision realized in extraordinary
detail, the result being a film that's easy to dive into and
enjoy.
