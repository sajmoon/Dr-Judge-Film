I&#39;ve done a search here on IMDb and I didn&#39;t turn up any results, but
I&#39;m sure that Eddy Vedder (the singer from Pearl Jam) has a 5 second
cameo near the start of the movie. He plays a member of the space
frigate crew that is investigating the anomaly. He&#39;s wearing a headset
and black shirt. Just after they send out the probe to investigate the
strange anomaly he says &quot;Probe will obtain it&#39;s objective in five
seconds.&quot; It&#39;s at around 15:10 on my DVD (though may be different on
yours) Anyone else notice him? Seeing as Tricky and a few other music
producers are also in the movie, i&#39;m positive it&#39;s him.<br /><br />Fantastic movie also, one of my favourites.
