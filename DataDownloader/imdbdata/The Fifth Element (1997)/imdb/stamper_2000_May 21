OK, this is overdone, stuff, but visually very attractive (not only because
of Milla Jovovich), plus the story is OK and there is a lot of action and
also there are a few laughs. The best one here is Milla (GOD, she is
beautiful), she's really great as the confused superior being, who only
speaks a foreign language (which sounds really good, Luc). I wonder why she
got a razzie nomination, those people who vote for that are really stupid.
If anyone should get it it is that president. Oldman was OK as the villain,
but not too great. He somehow reminded me of a very famous BAD guy in
history, yet I can't remember his name. Willis though is here at his
standard Die Hard form.<br /><br />Pretty good but terribly overdone sometimes.<br /><br />7 out of 10
