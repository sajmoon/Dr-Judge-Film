George Lucas has ripped off the entire air-traffic sequence from 'the Fifth
Element' and this says a lot. You can see parts of that same sequence is
Spielberg's 'Minority Report' as well. In fact James Cameron's Digital
Domain has created a work that stands the test of time and looks 100% real,
while ILM's work on a lot more recent projects looks completely
fake.<br /><br />This movie is all about aesthetics. Although the story is interesting, you
can ignore the dialog and still have fun. It's a cross between Star Gate,
Blade Runner and Star Wars.<br /><br />Together with 'Starship Troopers', the Fifth Element is the best Sci-Fi
movie of the 90s.<br /><br />9/10
