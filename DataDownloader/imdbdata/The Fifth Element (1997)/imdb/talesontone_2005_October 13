Very B-Movie-esquire, and it was obviously intentional. If you allow
yourself not to be too critical, this movie is a blast as it was
definitely made to be light and entertaining. And I love it for it.
It's a great SciFi to pop in at bed time to let your mind unwind. It's
very visual and it's kind of fun to play &quot;name that influence&quot; with all
of the sources it rips off. It's kind of a &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;-esquire thing
(think of the cabbie sequence from that movie) mixed with a ton of
other influences. I like that it kind of borrows a lot of it's world
view from blade runner (in a less dark way, mainly the technology and
griminess). This includes the actor who played Leon in that movie
playing the military goon come to inform Bruce Willis's character of
his re-activation. A great, fun, kind of stupid watch(I mean this in
the best possible way) You will find yourself coming back to again and
again. I kind of group this with Demolition Man and Judge Dredd (the
last one not quite measuring up to the other two).
