1998_October 3 

This movie was slated by the critics, why? Agreed it is not the greatest
film in history, but it is still pretty good. The look into Willis'
character is interesting to say the least, and has much more depth than any
of the other gung ho people he has played. Gary Oldman is as usual brilliant
as the films anti hero , no other actor can come close to his simplistic
evil that oozes out of him in his films. Miro Sorrino is not bad in her
first major movie, and does a decent enough job. A good storyline with a few
loose ends but well worth a watch.
