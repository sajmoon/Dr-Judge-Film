All that I have to say about this movie, is that it is the BEST movie that
i
have ever seen on the BIG screen, or on TV. I have watched this movie 10
times in the last week! The special effects, casting is all great. Milla
Jovovich (Leeloo) plays an excellent character as the 5th element. Out of
the 6,000 that were interviewed to play this part, I am glad that she got
chosen :). The special effects are HUGE in this movie. I keep on wonderin',
&quot;would it ever be like this in reality?&quot; THIS IS A MUST SEE IF YOU HAVEN'T
SEEN IT!!! I give it a BIG 10/10. Perfect. Just Perfect. It Mu5t Be Found
