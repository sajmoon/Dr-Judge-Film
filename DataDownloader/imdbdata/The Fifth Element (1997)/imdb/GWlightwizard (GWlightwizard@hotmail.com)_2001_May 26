This film is like some futuristic Candide.  Murphy's Law is at work around
every corner, even the villain gets his due by a flub of
fate.
Besson is having fun with our pretensions and the visual set piece is the
concert with the fabulous blue Diva and her Windex colored
blood.
The action scenes are even a send up of all the action scenes we've ever
been exposed to in cinema.  The story is not the important element(sic),
it's an excuse for the trappings and the flamboyant visual style of Bresson.
Some judicious editing could have tightened up the action but I can rather
understand why some reduntive scenes were left in because of the bravura
imagery.  If you are receptive to it, you are bowled over by the spectacular
visualization of the future and the sly comedy.  If you are not, it is just
a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing.  But, if you are not into being
adultish and are not prejudiced to the genre of space opera, this is a lot
of fun to watch.
