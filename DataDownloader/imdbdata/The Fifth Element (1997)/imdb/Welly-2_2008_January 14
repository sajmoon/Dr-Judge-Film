A masterpiece from start to finish. It would deserve the word &#39;perfect&#39;
were it not for the annoyance that is Ruby Rhod....the Scrappy Doo of
the cinema. What possessed Besson to include such a character? Anyway,
not to dwell on the one fly in the ointment, this is a visual, musical
and intellectual delight. Escapism at its best with every scene
bringing new pleasures.<br /><br />Bruce Willis plays it just right and Milla Jovovich is a revelation.
However, the star, for me, is Ian Holm who is a wonderful and
dependable spine going through the whole film. He&#39;s mix of bewilderment
and being thrilled is tremendous. Amid all the drama and excitement is
the soundtrack...Eric Serra&#39;s score is one of the best you&#39;ll hear and
further proof that the Oscars are as wise a judge of excellence as a
blind monkey with a rubber wand.<br /><br />Bottom line....a Rhod away from being perfect
