I hate movies about the future. They are always dark, depressing and
downright scary. But this thing is just, well, strange. I don&#39;t get it,
and I don&#39;t like it. And I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s supposed to be a comedy,
drama, satire, video game or what. I have no idea of what to make of
this mess. Bruce Willis and Luke Perry do good work, and that&#39;s why I
gave it a 3, otherwise, you can have it. I&#39;m commenting because they
are running one chapter of it on the loop at Best Buy, and I wish they
would remove it ASAP. Maybe if they kept the story in the past, the
archaelogical stuff...that had more human interest. The female lead has
an annoying voice.
