An absolutely dazzling motion picture experience, waking the sci-fi genre
from the sleeping death.
The commitment made to engineer this manifesto of the epic film- genre,
highly qualified for the Palme d'Or of the 1997 Cannes Film Festival.
Unfortunately, the picture didn't compete at all. With &quot;Le cinqueme
element&quot;, Luc Besson and Eric Serra reached the peak of their companionship
through many years- together with an almost perfect cast and
crew.
I've seen the film a dozen times, and it still manages to fascinate me. The
score, composed by ever-so-fulfilling Eric Serra, is well thought through
and enjoyable listening to- even without the motion picture to accompany
it.
Honors also go to Jean Paul Gaultier for State-of-the-Art costumes and
hairdressing. Never seen anything like it!<br /><br />MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU, LUC!
