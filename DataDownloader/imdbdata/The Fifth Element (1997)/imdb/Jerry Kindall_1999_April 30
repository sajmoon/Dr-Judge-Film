1999_April 30 

Sure, the plot was cliche-ridden, some of the acting was
terrible (the guy who played the President, and Gary Oldman as 
Zorg, stand out as examples), Chris Tucker was annoying as heck. 
But the look of the movie (not just the special effects but the 
costuming and even the alien design) was just stunning. Bruce 
Willis was OK (he was much better in &quot;12 Monkeys&quot;) but Milla was 
great, as was the guy who played the priest. There are images
from this movie that are going to be stuck in my brain for the 
rest of my life, like the entire diva sequence. Some of the 
lines were just priceless, too.  (&quot;Slightly greasy solar atoms,&quot;
anyone?) Oh yes, and the music was just incredible.  I found, 
much to my amazement, that this movie actually gets better with 
repeat viewing.
