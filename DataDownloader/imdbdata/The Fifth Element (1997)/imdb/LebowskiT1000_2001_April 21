I find it hilarious that most of the people that have left comments on this
movie either HATE the film or LOVE the film.  There's only a few people that
say &quot;It's alright&quot;.<br /><br />I saw this movie when it first came out in the theaters and hadn't bothered
seeing it again till last night, and I'd have to say that I liked it even
less this time around.<br /><br />To be perfectly honest, I thought it was a HORRIBLE movie!  I don't really
get why anyone would like it.  The story is horrible, the music terribly
mis-placed, the comedy is just dumb and the characters are
lame.<br /><br />Ok, so the &quot;Fifth Element&quot; is this alleged &quot;perfect being&quot; (Milla Jovovich)?
 I'm sorry...but STUPID!!!  And while I'm on the subject, why does everyone
like Milla so much?  Don't get me wrong, she's a fine actress and an ok
looker, but for this &quot;perfect being&quot; couldn't they get someone more-perfect
than Milla, I guess I just wasn't terribly impressed with her looks.  Ok,
back to what I was saying about the plot...there is this big ball of &quot;evil&quot;
coming towards the earth?  Again...STUPID!!!  They didn't even attempt to
explain what the HELL this big ball of evil is or where it came from or why
it was headed toward earth.  Maybe I just missed something in the film, but
it didn't make any sense to me.<br /><br />Ok, I have to mention this now, How on earth can anyone say that Chris
Tucker's character was interesting...no wait...tolerable?  Chris' character
was GOD-AWFUL!!!  Screaming like a little whiny bitch every 5 seconds!  His
character was utterly useless, his character could have EASILY been cut out
of the film and it would have made a MUCH better film.<br /><br />The only other character that I hated just as much as Chris Tucker's was the
president of the federation.  The casting person should be shot!  Why did
they choose Tommy 'Tiny' Lister as the president?  He looks like a
cross-eyed retarded thug!  I just couldn't accept that this guy was the
president, ANYONE else would have fit-the-mold better than this
guy.<br /><br />As for Gary Oldman, I thought he did a fine job with the character he
played, but what was with all that lame-ass wardrobe?  What was with that
stupid plastic thing on the one side of his head.  I just couldn't buy it, I
thought it was dumb looking.  And while I'm thinking of it, what the HELL
was up with that stupid looking animal thing that Gary Oldman had in his
office when he almost choked near the beginning of the film?  It looked like
something you'd see in a Flintstones movie (no disrespect to the
Flintstones).  I just thought it was SO out of place and SO
un-needed.<br /><br />Also, I couldn't stand those aliens that had the egg shaped ship in the
beginning of the film.  I couldn't stand their little heads, their enormous
shoulders, and how slow they moved.  I didn't get it, were they aliens or
robots or aliens in robotic suits or what?<br /><br />I didn't really have any problem with the Ian Holm character or Bruce
Willis', but those were the only two that I could easily
tolerate.<br /><br />I WILL give some kudos to the special effects department, IMPRESSIVE!!!  In
fact, I'm actually considering buying this movie just for the special
effects, they're really quite good.  But sadly, that's the only thing it's
got going for it.<br /><br />You know, I like just about every sci-fi movie that comes along and I'm not
kidding, I like just about everything, but I really DIDN'T like this film. 
It had a few good ideas, but it just seemed like they gave a 5 year-old a
whole lot of money to make a movie.  Overall, I'm not going to stop you from
seeing this movie, come to your own conclusion, but it was just dumb.  I
hope you enjoy the film more than I did.  Until next time,<br /><br />-Cortex
