1999_July 7 

When I saw this movie the first time, on a big screen, in the summer of
1997, I said this was as big a leap forward in visual effects as Star Wars
was in 1977.  New York in the 24th Century is seen as layers of air car
traffic.  Phlotsom Paradise hovers above a blue planet and it looks so
real.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it did not make the transition to video very well.  This is
very much a big-screen movie.  On video it looks like a comic book with
actors.  But even so, there are scenes, like the diva's song, where I
rewind
it and watch it twice or three times before I continue with the
movie.
