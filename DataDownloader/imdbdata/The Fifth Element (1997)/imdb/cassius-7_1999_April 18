Besson&acute;s previous flics, like Leon, Nikita or Atlantis were awesome and so
is his newest piece 5 Element...I even think its his best movie. The
universe Besson shows is breathtaking, even more than the one showed in
Blade Runner. Milla Jovovich did a really great job. Gary Oldman is as
great
as in Leon. Bruce Willis managed to portrait an interesting character, so
he
did a good job as well (though nothing can beat his James Cole in 12
Monkeys). The visuals are marvelous...Gaultier&acute;s costumes , Serra&acute;s
music...all of those things make this movie awesome...I read that this is
a
&quot;SCI-FI MOVIE OF THE DECADE&quot; ....I have to agree with that
