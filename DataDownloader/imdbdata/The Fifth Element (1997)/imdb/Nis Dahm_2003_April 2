Now here's a rare sight in the Sci-Fi genre, a movie that not alone
contains
some of the most amazing set designs in the history of futuristic movies,
but also features top notch actors (who perform at their very best), and
humour, great humour dammit!
As previously mentioned the set designs are &quot;AMAZING&quot;, very original and
colourful but never boarders on the ridiculous. This is not easily done!
The
costumes designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier are truly original, and this along
with the very Moebius inspired universe embracing the story, creates a
production set that is unrivalled in it's attempt at creating a colourful
approach to the sci-fi genre. Furthermore this makes me wonder why Luc
Besson is not given the funds to produce large budget movies more often!
Obviously the money is well spent.<br /><br />The very humorous approach to the genre, which could have ended up
terribly,
are also executed very well I think.
Bruce Willis has the subtle qualities, that makes him perfect for this
movie. He is a man who faces the dangers of the world with a sigh, and a
joke closely follows. It is immensely entertaining when he sometimes
realises the absurdity of his own situation and just reacts with
shrug!
Gary Oldman is also hilarious as the evil, but also somewhat pathetic,
Zorg.
Even Milla Jovovich performs quite well, as the strong hard punching, but
also very fragile heroine.<br /><br />In conclusion I find it appropriate to mention that the plot is not
flawless, but that this is largely overshadowed by the qualities of this
great sci-fi flick!
