1999_April 18 

A friend dragged me to the theater to see this, and I had no idea what I
was
in for.  From the start, the music, the effects, the cast, I loved it.  It
was different, strange, a bit wacky - but facinating.  When it came out on
video, I bought it and now my family watches it every month or more. We
all
love it.  Of course, I adore Bruce Willis, and I love Leeloo, the priest,
the special effects, the blue lady singing, the bad guys,  and Zorg.
Don't
look for Speilberg perfection - but a fun romp.  Bring the popcorn and
relax!!
