A fantastic pop-culture feast for the eyes. A simple good-vs-evil tale told
with humour, stylish costumes, sharp direction and great
effects.<br /><br />I am going to stick my neck out here, and say it's the best &quot;fun&quot; Sci-Fi
Movie ever made - taking on the likes of Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar
Gallaticar, and knocking them into a cocked Stormtroopers Helmet. With it's
U.K. 15 Certificate, it is able to explore more mature themes - so perhaps
this is its appeal when comparing it against standard &quot;bubble-gum&quot; Sci-Fi
flicks.<br /><br />It's beautifully filmed, with eye-popping colours, sets and costumes by
Jean-Paul Gaultier. Nearly all the costumes are fun and widely impractical,
allowing Gaultier to squeeze muscle-bound extras into Lycra shorts for some
mild homo-erotic images. Milla Jovovich (Leeloo) gets carefully placed 2
inch straps as a costume to jump off buildings with, for the heterosexuals
in the audience. <br /><br />The humour ranges from slap-stick with Lee Evans, black with Gary Oldman,
subtle with Ian Holm and deadpan with Bruce Willis. I think it's this that
really makes the film - it will just not take it's self seriously, but still
delivers tension and conflict. Oldman showing off his latest multi-function
ZF-1 gun is just a cinemagraphic treat - with real punch on the effects and
treacle dialogue delivery from Oldman. &quot;A word on firepower. Three thousand
round clip with bursts of 3 to 300. With the Replay button (another Zorg
invention) it's even easier. One shot, and Replay sends every following shot
to the same location&quot;.<br /><br />Luc Besson is not worried about using character actors for most of the
smaller parts - so the screen is filled with a superb looking supporting
cast, rather than the &quot;bland&quot; model-look-alike extras in most films. Some of
the lighting and effects emphasise this aspect, which makes for great
viewing, and adds realism to the experience - as most scientists will
probably not look like Male Fashion Models!<br /><br />I suppose the only flaw in the film is the simplistic story-line. It is
almost childish in its concept, but gets such a superb cinematic treatment,
I can forgive this - and get on with enjoying what it has to
offer.<br /><br />It's up there with the Sci-Fi greats, head-and-shoulders above most of them
- so make a date with a Pop-Culture Classic, and then get it voted into the
Top 50 - for heaven's sake....
