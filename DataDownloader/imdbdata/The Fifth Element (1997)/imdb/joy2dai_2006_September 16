Where can you find romance, action, sci-fi, and comedy in one film? The
Fifth Element delivers all. Great pairing with Milla Jovovich and Bruce
Willis makes the movie a favorite for all. This film beams them into
great careers. Location journeys from earth to space and back. Well
worth the time spent, and price of a DVD.<br /><br />Film techniques by the director Luc Besson are well documented. Actors
were not aware of costumes of others so certain scenes would be actual
reactions. Also, the director started writing the movie at age 16, and
it took 16 years to have it filmed. It was important to him to have
certain details on the film set.
