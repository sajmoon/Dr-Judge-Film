Lot of people have already said most things I would like to about this
movie, which turns to be 7 years old already this year. But in short, I
would like to thank Luc not about all fun in this movie, but about it's
message. Episodes are changing fun with serious all the time, but in the
end, you really get a message - we (as a people) have survived not because
some hero saves us, not because we have a weapons or armies... We survive
because there is love and believe in peace in all of us, at least in most
corner of our hearts. <br /><br />You can call it naive. I call it common sense.<br /><br />10 out of 10
