I could never understand the appeal for this film, it was has a much higher
rating than &quot;Independance Day&quot;, the big action/sci-fi hit from the summer
before, which I, and most other critcs agree, is a better film.  The plot of
this movie is absolutely mind numbing, aliens are ready to destroy earth,
and Bruce Willis and his gang go to destroy them.  Throw in a few real
oddball characters to make it even weirder, and a whole load of futuristic
images, and you have &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;.  Don't get me wrong, its fun, but
never take it seriously, or expect anything great, because its not.  So just
sit back and be prepared for something real weird and incoherent.  My user
rating: 6.1/10, mostly for the futuristic stuff.
