Our favourite movie. Everybody loves it, adults and kids aged 5-10, and we
don't tire of watching it.  Friends love it too.  Its got a bit of
everything - action, humour for kids and adults.  Not sure why it doesn't
rate higher.  Great video and audio, the Diva scene is a classic for
demoing
home theatre systems.
