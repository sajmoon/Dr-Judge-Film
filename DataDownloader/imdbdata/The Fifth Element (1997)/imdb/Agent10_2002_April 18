Most sci-fi films try to break new ground 
with special effects and visual eye candy, 
but The Fifth Element created a whole 
new concept in the genre: the art-action 
science fiction.<br /><br />While this film has many flaws, particularly 
in the flow of the plot, visually, it surpasses 
most sci-fi films I have ever seen. Not even 
Planet of the Apes (2001) could compete 
with this film's cinematography. I firmly 
believe 1997 was a great year for this concept 
of film, considering the highly visual Alien 
Resurrection came out the same year. 
Hopefully, some of the more modern sci-fi 
films will encompass some of the visual 
ideals this film set forth.
