1999_February 19 

Dumb doesn't always have to be just dumb, you know.  There is such a thing
as good dumb fun, and this movie provides it in spades.  The prologue was
somewhat misconceived, though I guess it was necessary for plot purposes,
but once things kicked in with the future, it was entertaining.  Luc Besson
knows how to make entertaining junk food, as he did with &quot;Nikita&quot; and &quot;The
Professional&quot;, and he does it again here.  For one thing, he takes the time
to create a dazzling world that also makes sense.  It's colorful,
eye-popping, and visionary.  For another, while the story is pretty
standard, it's told with style, wit, and verve.<br /><br />Except for one or two over-the-top performances per film, it seems Besson
favors deadpan acting as a form of humor, and the actors here are
well-suited to it.  Willis can be monotonous in films like &quot;The Last Boy Scout&quot;, but here, he's got something to react to, and he does it well.  Ian
Holm lends a touch of gravity to the film, as always.  Milla Jovovich is
just fine as Leeloo, playing as if things were just occuring to her.  The
two over-the-top performances, of course, come from Chris Tucker and Gary
Oldman.  I can see why some thought Tucker annoying, but I thought he was
funny.  But, of course, he was no match for Oldman, who, as he proved in &quot;The Professional&quot;, is an entertaining villain.  His voice (which he claimed was a
cross between Ross Perot and Bugs Bunny) was even funny.  All in all, check
your brain at the door and have a good time.
