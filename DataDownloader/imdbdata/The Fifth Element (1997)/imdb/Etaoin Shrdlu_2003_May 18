From watching The Fifth Element, one cannot escape the &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; look
of
the movie; the whole movie, the sets, the story, the characters have
simply
walked-out of a french/belgian comic book...<br /><br />Like so many millions of french people born in Besson's years, it was hard
to grow without reading the &quot;Tintin&quot;, &quot;Spirou&quot; and, most importantly,
&quot;Pilote&quot; comic magazines (&quot;Pilote&quot; can rightfully claim to be the
precursor
to &quot;M&eacute;tal-Hurlant&quot; (translated as &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;).<br /><br />Zorg, the villain, has obviously been patterned after &quot;Zorglub&quot;, Spirou's
most notorious villain, with only a tiny remnant of his beard, though.
Both
want to achieve total domination, and they do so with immensely powerful
means and an army of docile subordinates, but not without fumbling
helplessly with technology. While Zorg's gets killed, Zorglub makes his
exit
on a lowly bicycle instead of one of his high-tech skycars, after grossly
misspelling &quot;Coca-Cola&quot; on the moon.<br /><br />And about Korben Dallas and LeeLo, don't look towards Jean Giraud (M&ouml;bius)
for inspiration. Korben is obviously inspired from Christin &amp; M&eacute;zi&egrave;res'
tech-savvy Val&eacute;rian, while Leelo is Laureline (a sorceress [witches aren't
usually beautiful] who comes into the high-tech stories through magic, and
who always saves Val&eacute;rian's ass when his high-technology gets
overwhelmed).<br /><br />The Fifth Element is obviously a frenchman's satire of the americans,
which
are regarded as being kitsch and masters of bad-taste, yet not without a
hint of admiration for New-York City, the average frenchman's idea of what
America is. How better embody this better than with the &uuml;berkitsch
Fhlostom
Paradise luxury liner? And to drive the point home even more effectively,
Ruby Rhod really rubs-in the epitome of kitschness.<br /><br />Likewise, Besson's view of futuristic New-York is an endless superposition
of clich&eacute;s; the kamikaze cabbies, the towering buildings, the street
violence, the cool policemen going about their business, and the zanyness
of
some eccentric characters not noticed by the rest of the people... But
here,
one will have no trouble crediting M&ouml;bius for the scenery, directly
inspired
from the well-cities of L'Incal.<br /><br />Finally, The Fifth Element is an immensely enjoyable movie, if only
because
of it's unconventionnal roots: the franco/belgian comic-book
science-fiction
school.
