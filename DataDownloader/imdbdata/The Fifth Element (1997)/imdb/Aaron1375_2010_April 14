2010_April 14 
This film is a bit of a curiosity in terms of movies in the last twenty
years or so. Why you ask? Because everything indicates that this movie
should have been a rather big box office hit, and while it did rather
good overall when you factor in the whole world, here in the United
States it kind of had a lackluster showing. Makes no sense as it seems
to be liked by a good many people and it had Bruce Willis at his best
and introduced two relative newcomers to the screen in Milla Jovavich
and Chris Tucker (though I believe Tucker was in &#x22;Friday&#x22; before this
one). It also had really good special effects, especially in the city.
So good in fact I often feel George Lucas really liked those city
scenes as he seemed to add a place just like it in his second Star Wars
movie &#x22;Attack of the Clones&#x22;. The plot is pretty good, though it gets
to be a bit much in areas as there are multiple bad guys here and there
for our hero to overcome including time as the longer things go on the
more likely it is for the Earth to be destroyed. Yes, an ordinary
cabbie gets to be a hero, though he is an ex-soldier, as a young and
mysterious girl comes crashing through the roof of his flying cab. On
with some nice chases and such and a trip to a cruise ship in space for
a bizarre operatic fight scene. The movie has a bunch of stuff going on
though like I said at times to much as poor Gary Oldman&#x27;s character
just does not get enough screen time and he factors almost not at all
in the final showdown. Still, overall this movie is a fun watch even
though there is a lot going on and the ending was a tad anti-climatic.
