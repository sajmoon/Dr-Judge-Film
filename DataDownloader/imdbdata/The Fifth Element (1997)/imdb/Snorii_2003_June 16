This movie adds in a lot of fun while keeping the storyline very tight.
The
transitions are great.  A lot of characters finish each other's sentences
in
the next scene.  While the movie is very good the first time you watch it,
you notice all the small details after watching it again.  And who doesn't
want to stare at Milla Jovovich for a couple of hours.
:)<br /><br />Any fan of sci-fi will love this movie, but you don't have to be a sci-fi
fan to enjoy it.  Bruce Willis is great as the hero, and Gary Oldman is
probably one of the best actors today.  He transforms himself to the part.
And also Ian Holm is a great supporting character for Bruce and
Milla.
