Visually, the fifth element is an enjoyable colorful experience with a
very imaginative production design-- nonetheless it feels very camp and
unreal. Story wise, I find it very trite at its core. You are told a
wonderful science fiction premise but then are delivered a plot that
feels too juvenile, too easy, with so many of those one-of-a-time
coincidences that happen only in (certain) movies. I expected much more
from this movie but felt disappointed. Maybe it&#x27;s the fact that I
watched it for the very first time on 2012; but then again, a very-good
movie is good independently from its time. Gary Oldman is great, Bruce
Willis is Bruce Willis and Milla fits perfectly in her role. The rest
of the cast is at the same level of this movie-- their dialogues and
personalities don&#x27;t seem to have any other purpose than to portrait
worn out characters from played-out stories. I won&#x27;t try to argue any
further that the movie is bad, this is just my opinion, but I feel it
is impossible to rate this movie a 10 from any perspective. So what do
I feel is a timeless and amazing story? Twelve Monkeys for example. I
think it is worth mentioning it.
