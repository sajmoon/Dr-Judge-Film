 I had to scan down thought the index to see if anyone else took this movie
the way I did. It a really funny flick, a great ride and a visual feast.
Granted their aren't a hell of a lot of sci-fi comedies around but if more
are made they could use this as a measuring stick. So what the plot is
standard and thin, with so much going on there's little time to fit plot
developing dialog in. Even the diva who most people seem to hate was nicely
interwoven with leeloo's fight sequence. There's a lot of well paced cutting
in this movie. Leeloo's stone story mixed with Gary Oldman's first attempt
at acquiring them (including the hilarious weapon demo) comes to mind.<br /><br /> As for the sets and art they're great. All the little details like the 2/3
filter cigs to the fold away furniture shows an attention to detail with an
eye towards comedy. 
 I've always wondered if the director intended to make this gem so funny I
can't believe it could be accidentally this funny. Even the costumes are
funny. Only the warped mind of a runway designer could have come up with the
hat the guy (I forget his name) wears when he tries to rob Bruce Willis. He
looks like a futuristic crack head only he's burnt so many brain cells he
can't operate futuristic weapons. 
 Chris Tucker too over the top? Naah. Reminds me of another well cut
sequence, the spaceship lift off.
 Well that's only my opinion. Most probably disagree and think I'm a meat
Popsicle but hey SMOKE YOU! <br /><br />PS If you want one more laugh from this flick go to te external review index
and read the conservative Christian review.
