1999_January 22 

The Fifth Element seems to be one of those movies that you either love or
hate. And I love it. The story itself is quite interesting, throwing a new
spin of sorts on the battle between good and evil. The broad range of
characters adds to the interest and story well (with the exception of The
President). The visual effects (especially those of the city) and alien
designs are stunning and quite creative. Chris Tucker, although annoying at
times, provides quite a bit of humor later in the film. I was surprised,
however, that it was not the action packed adventure that I had expected.
But, I was also not disappointed by the lack of action as the story (for me)
kept the film going. Most of the real action takes place in the last bit of
the movie.
The only real mystery is how Luke Perry managed to get a title credit for 5
minutes of screen time.
