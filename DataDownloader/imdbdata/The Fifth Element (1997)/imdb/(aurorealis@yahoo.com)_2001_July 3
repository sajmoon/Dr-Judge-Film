2001_July 3 

I watched this film finally in its entirety for the first time last night.
Up until that point, I've caught pieces of it on TV, and always from the
airport scene on, so I'd missed a great deal of it before.
I really like this movie. It's a simple plot and pure fun.  Bruce Willis
plays his regular Joe hero well, and though I've ever been a fan of Gary
Oldman, I admit I like the fact he picked a Southern drawl as his accent.
Yes, I'd liken it to Die Hard meets Brazil (especially with the inclusion
of
Ian Holm in the cast). And it's true that Chris Tucker can be annoying -
but
I think his over-the-top performance not only suits him but adds a
dimension
to the film - a foil to the stoic Korbin Dallas character.
As for the debate on Milla Jovovich being the Supreme, Perfect Being - I
don't think it's a question of her beauty that makes her perfect -
perfection, remember, is actually boring. Perfection is about symmetry.
Perfection - in this film - is about holding many elements together, about
being all encompassing of a great deal of things.  The Fifth Element is
strong, smart, capable of reasoning and understanding and, yes, beautiful.
But everyone's idea of beauty is as vast as everyone's idea of God, so it
is
Luc Besson's interpretation.  Besides, I think Milla did an amazing job,
especially the way she spoke in that language that is a mix of Italian,
French and Latin, from what I could tell. And I've never  been a fan of
hers, but my perception of her has been altered by this film. So I think
that constitutes a job well done. Plus, I do think this film needs to be
viewed with a sense of humor - because that is at the obvious heart of
this
film.
I'd give the film an 8 out of 10, points being docked because I do agree
the
relationship between Korbin and Leeloo should have been more smoothly
developed, but, then again, who's to debate love at first
sight?<br /><br />
