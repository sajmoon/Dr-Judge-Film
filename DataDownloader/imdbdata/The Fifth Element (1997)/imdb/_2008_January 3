Simply awesome! So incredibly brilliant in all its details. Jean Luc
Besson surpassed his other movie &quot;perfect&quot; movie, Nikita (the original
movie, no the TV series, blah). I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s already been more
than ten years, because if it were to come out today as a new release,
it would raffle away all movies awards. Take any scene, and allow your
eyes to wander around, look at every details and how much thought has
been put into it. There are so many lines in the script that are now
memorable quotes. Discontent reviewers may have failed to appreciate
the breadth of erudition packed behind so many of those lines. For
instance, the &quot;Are you Germans?&quot; quote is a relish of the pre-colonial
old world on the brink of WWI, you can&#39;t grasp its cultural meaning
without this sensitivity.<br /><br />Simply a masterpiece from a genius artist.
