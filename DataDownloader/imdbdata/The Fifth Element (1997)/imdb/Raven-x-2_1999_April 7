1999_April 7 

The movie script was so bad I suppose the actors had a freestyle, where
they
would say what ever they wanted to, it was a plain out crappy movie, and I
bet you no one will rember this piece of cheese after 50 years, this was
like a mix of every sci fi movie, and then it tried to be a comedy, or at
least it looked like it was trying to be one.
