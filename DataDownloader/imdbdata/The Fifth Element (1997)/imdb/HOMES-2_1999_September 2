1999_September 2 

This was a terrible, terrible movie.  My disappointment is worsened by the
fact that with only a small bit of effort this may have been a decent
movie.
They relied on special effects so much that there was nothing left to
make
this anything more than a video game.  Chris Tucker's annoying character
was
used way beyond its usefulness, Gary Oldham's character was a buffoon, and
why did Luke Perry even bother?  This movie was written by a second
grader.
When it wasn't dumb it was predictable.  I get angry whenever I think that
someone actually released this to theaters.  It's too bad MST3K never got
a
crack at it...
