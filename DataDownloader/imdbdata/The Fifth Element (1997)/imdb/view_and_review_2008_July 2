OK, I&#39;ll be honest... I didn&#39;t get it. A race of aliens in charge of
protecting planet earth. Another, more sinister alien trying to destroy
planet earth. A scantily clad woman that is the key to protecting earth
as the &quot;fifth element&quot;. There were some strange creatures and some
strange humans (Ruby Rhod, played by Chris Tucker). With all of the
creatures it reminded me of Dark Crystal or some Jim Henson production.<br /><br />I get that the planet had to be saved, but I didn&#39;t get all the stuff
in between. The whole movie was strange. The characters seemed random
and non-essential. The movie wasn&#39;t all that bad, it just wasn&#39;t all
that good.
