I usually don&#39;t like movies exhibiting too simplistic battle of good
against evil but this one is an exception. Besson, Willis and
Jovovitch, served by Serra&#39;s music offer an incredible journey in a
rich, colorful world (close by some aspects to some universe exhibited
in Valerian&#39;s series created by Meziere). Watching this movie you will
undertake a non-stop tour around incredible characters (Oldman being
extremely good here, which is also the case of Ian Holm and Tommy
Lister ; and who could forget Chris Tucker&#39;s part, the beauty of Milla
Jovovich and the presence of Willis), futuristic world, full of humor
and funny situations ; a real fairytale for adults.<br /><br />The Fifth element is one of my all-time favorite movie, a real
masterpiece of entertainment, appealing to most. A full 10/10.
