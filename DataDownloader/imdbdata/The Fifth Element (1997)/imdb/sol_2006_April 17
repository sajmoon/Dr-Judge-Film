****SPOILERS*** Every 5,000 years Evil is unleashed on the Universe
that if not checked will destroy everything there is in existence. In
the summer of 1914 with nothing but war and destruction to look forward
to on earth aliens landed near the ancient Egyptian ruins to retrieve
the four magical stones. The stones represent the four elements, water
earth wind &amp; fire.They were to be put away to avoid from being
destroyed until three hundred years in the future. That&#39;s when Evil is
to be unpleased and where they&#39;ll be needed to combat it with the help
of a catalyst the critical fifth element, the perfect human being, to
defeat it.<br /><br />It&#39;s now three hundred years later and Evil, in the form of a massive
fireball, is headed towards earth threatening to knocked the blue and
green planet out of it&#39;s orbit and destroy every living thing on it.
The earth enters into a battle between good and evil. Evil is
represented by the greedy and immoral Emanuel Zorg, Gary Olman, who
with the help of the alien Mondoshawans is determined to get his hands
on the four ancient stones, elements,to keep them from fusing together
with the fifth to prevent the fireball from crashing into earth. Good
is represented by Father Vito Cornelius, Ian Holm, who knows that time
is very short in preventing evil from prevailing and knows that without
the important fifth element evil will be impossible to stop. <br /><br />Like in almost every important event over the course of history it
takes an obscure person being taxi driver and former special forces
major Korban Dallas, Bruce Willis, to put all the pieces together.
Dallas almost single handedly save the world but he couldn&#39;t do it
without a passenger that dropped in, laterally, on the backseat of his
cab. A reconstructed alien Leeloo, Milia Jovovich, the elusive Fifth
Element.<br /><br />With Zorg desperately trying to get the important four stones he&#39;s
stymied at every turn together with his bumbling alien allies. Dallas
is given the assignment to find the stones by Presient Linberg, Tommy
Tiny Liser. The intelligence report he gets is that there&#39;s a good
chance that the stones are hidden somewhere at Fhloston Paradise cruse
spaceship. Dallas is fixed, by the secret service, to win a contest to
get a trip for two, together with Leeloo, to Fhloston. On the spaceship
he discovers that the stones are in the possession of the resorts main
attraction singer Diva Plavalagunma, Malwenn Lebesco. <br /><br />The second half of &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; explodes with the force of a
super nova as Dallas and Father Cornelius ,not to mention Leeloo, have
it out with the forces of evil represented by Zorg and Co on the cruse
ship with almost everyone there ending up vaporized. Zorg loses the
support of the Mondoshawans when Dallas knocks off their fearless
leader, who was holding Father Cornelius hostage. Leaving them as
helpless as a body without a head or brain. Zorg is left on the
Fhloston Paradise pleasure cruse spaceship, as Dallas &amp; Co.exit it,
that detonates in a fairy explosion from a bomb that he and his alien
cohorts planted there. It&#39;s now up to Dallas together with Leeloo and
Father Cornelius and his young assistant David, Charlie Creed-Miles, as
well as the Fhloston Paradise Master of Ceremonies Ruby Rhod, Chris
Tucker, to get back to the Egyptian ruins. To find and put all the
pieces together, the five elements, and hope that they have enough time
left to do it before the earth is reduced to a burning cinder.<br /><br />Corny but extremely entertaining movie that you can&#39;t at all take
seriously. Just sit back and enjoy the show with a tongue and cheek
performance by Bruce Willis as Korben Dallas. Dallas in the movie lost
his job as a cab driver and his wife, who ran off with his lawyer, as
well as having his nagging mother not leaving him alone for even a
moment constantly threatening to throw herself into traffic. In the end
all that pales by comparison to what he&#39;s up against in his heroic
effort to save the world from the forces of evil both on earth as well
as in deep space.
