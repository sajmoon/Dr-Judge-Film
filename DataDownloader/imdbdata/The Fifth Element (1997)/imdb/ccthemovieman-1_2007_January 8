This is one wild science-fiction ride that is generally fun to watch
until Chris Tucker enters the film near the end. It&#39;s fun, in large
part, because of the great special-effects, excellent 5.1surround sound
and likable hero.<br /><br />Storywise, it&#39;s a little too far out for my theological tastes but you
can&#39;t take anything of this seriously. However, calling Milla
Jovovich&#39;s character (&quot;Leeloo&quot;) a &quot;supreme being&quot; is not only
blasphemous but just plain annoying.<br /><br />However, if you enjoy wild effects, strange characters and a very
fast-moving, action-packed film you&#39;ll like this, even if the story is
stupid.<br /><br />Bruce Willis does a nice job with his low-key role of &quot;Korben Dallas,&quot;
an average type of Joe who drives a cab in futuristic New York City.
Jovovich looks a little like Uma Thurman, facially. She&#39;s interesting
to watch with hr looks, strange dress and strange language. Gary Oldman
plays his normal wacked-out character. In this one, he has to sports
the world&#39;s worst hairdo ever seen on film! Tucker, who plays a
RuPaul-type DJ called &quot;Ruby Rhod,&quot; and he grates on your nerves,
big-time. I would have enjoyed this movie, especially the last part
without him and his many OMGs and flaming hysterics. He almost
single-handedly ruined the film.
