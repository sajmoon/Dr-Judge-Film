2000_January 11 

the filmmakers of this film seemed to be trying so hard to entertain the
pants off of the viewer at every single second sort of forgot to make a good
movie in the process.<br /><br />the visual design is fantastic, but all of the performances are so annoying
and in your face that a headache is imminent.
the ONLY person in the cast with any charm was the gorgeous Milla Johovich.
her costume, which looks like a bunch of band aids, was obviously designed
purely to show off her superbly toned and sexy body. all she does is spout
alien mumbo jumbo through  most of the film, but she does bring a cute
quirky charm to her character that is genuine and welcome.<br /><br />if your head hasn't pounded in a while and you like to abuse yourself, rent
this movie and you'll be popping tylenol like you never have before by the
end of it.<br /><br />rating:3 (avoids a 1 only due to the visuals and Milla's costume)
