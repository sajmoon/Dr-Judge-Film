1999_February 27 

This is the world's greatest movie!
Also the world's most controversial movie, with the majority of people
saying '10', but with it only getting an average of about 7. So you either
LOVE it or HATE it, there's no in between.<br /><br />But it just rocks!! Awesome special effects, awesome sounds, awesome music,
awesome actors, and awesomly entertaining.<br /><br />It's so much FUN to watch, who wants to watch another plane crash or another
FBI film, how boring.
Not the 5th Element, giving you a colourful, exciting look at New York of
the future.
It's funny as well, especially the futuristic DJ played well by Chris
Tucker.
The whole movie takes you for a fun, exciting, 'enjoyable' ride as you watch
Bruce Willis and the beautiful Milla Jovovich save the
world.
A 'must see' for anyone who wants to be entertained, and that's what it's all
about, being entertained.<br /><br />**Brilliant 10/10**
