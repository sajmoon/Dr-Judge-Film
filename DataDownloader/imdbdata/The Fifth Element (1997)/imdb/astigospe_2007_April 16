...he&#x27;ll give it to you and waste 90 million bucks doing it.<br /><br />It was a highly anticipated, over-hyped blockbuster from Luc Besson of
&#x22;Nikita&#x22; and &#x22;Leon&#x22; fame, featuring Bruce Willis still sitting on
laurels from his performance in wonderful &#x22;12 Monkeys&#x22; just a year
before. What I was expecting was nothing short of a miracle in film-
making, thinking how European cinematography can only outdo Hollywood
once it lays its hands on similarly high budget.<br /><br />Yes, my expectations were pretty much slaughtered once the film started
rolling. What I got in for was a mere charade of clich&#xE9;s, goofy acting
and unwanted moral lessons garnished with the music of the hour.
Nothing in it had any meaning or weight to it. I tried to watch it as a
silly comedy but nothing really did it for me back then (and the guy
laughing hysterically in the seat behind me certainly didn&#x27;t help).
Then I expected at least some point to all that and indeed it was laid
heavy handedly upon the audience in the end when, out of the blue, the
movie detoured into dead serious. Of course, by that point, I gave up
and made sure not to take anything in it seriously. Goes especially for
Besson&#x27;s teenage naivet&#xE9; in making his case against war and human
nature (one has to wonder about him - the man was closing 40 at the
time). I was probably just as naive as him expecting something else.<br /><br />Nowadays, however, I try not to miss &#x22;The 5th element&#x22; whenever they
air it on TV. Once you go past the pretentious BS you can find in it
precious gems that redeem the movie. One of those is certainly Chris
Tucker and his outlandish performance (the only thing I could
acknowledge as quality even back then). Too bad his character was
conceived as a strictly sidekick - there were opportunities for him to
develop into a really meaningful protagonist. Many of supporting
characters and lines are also funny (although majority still isn&#x27;t - I
classify it under &#x22;the French humor&#x22;). The cinematography and art
design are lovely in their colorfulness and, in retrospect, it&#x27;s a
treat to watch Bruce Willis from the era while he still had some hair
to his head.
