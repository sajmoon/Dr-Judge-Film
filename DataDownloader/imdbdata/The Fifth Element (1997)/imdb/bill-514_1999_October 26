I can't understand why this movie didn't get better reviews.  I've seen it
several time (unusual for me) and really enjoyed each time.  It has great
attention to detail, the kind of stuff that you see little subtleties when
you see it again that fill out the plot more.<br /><br />The fight scenes great.<br /><br />Bill Oliver<br /><br />
