I've loved this flick since the first showing, and it only gets better over
time.<br /><br />Besson's clear cinematographical direction combined with Eric Serra's
musical genius worked perfectly on this one. The original futuristic vision
is refreshing. The special effects don't look very computerized, making it
feel more like Manga than Star Trek.<br /><br />The key of the movie isn't in the plot (which is so-so, especially when at
the very end), but in the huge amount of memorable scenes.<br /><br />Gary Oldman was brilliant as always, playing the evil Zorg. Jovovich fit
well in the role of Leeloo. Chris Tucker added some additional comic
relief.<br /><br />Willis' performance was my only big annoyment,
maybe his acting abilities were just not expressive enough next to
Oldman's.<br /><br />The Fifth Element is my absolute number one entertainment movie of the 90s,
it's got a perfect blend of beautiful cinematography, good laughs and well
executed action.
