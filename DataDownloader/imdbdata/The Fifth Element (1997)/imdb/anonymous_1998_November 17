What a horrible movie! It actually took me two days to get through it. Was
it the blatant Taco Bell advertising with the Taxi Cab slamming into Taco
Bell? Probably. Because I didn't rent the movie to see a Taco Bell
commercial, and Taco Bell certainly didn't cut down on the price of the
video any.<br /><br />BUT...the story is mindless and won't change your life in the slightest.
It's perfect for inviting friends over, eating pizza, and talking through
the whole movie.
