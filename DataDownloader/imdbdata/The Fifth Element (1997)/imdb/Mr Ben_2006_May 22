As the movie world recovers from the heady glamour of Cannes, I found
myself lamenting the loss of Luc Besson to Hollywood. Nothing he has
directed since this Gallic self-indulgent sci-fi has matched the
success of his earlier work like &#x22;Nikita&#x22; or one of my favourite ever
films &#x22;Leon&#x22;. Despite concentrating on writing and producing, Besson
remains an extraordinary and unique visionary in cinema and nowhere is
his vision purer than here. Whether it is to your taste or not is a
different matter.<br /><br />Besson takes us head-first into a vibrant future where, in deep space,
a terrible Evil has formed and threatens all life in the universe. The
only thing that can stop it is a supreme being known as the Fifth
Element (Milla Jovovich) which, when combined with the existing four
elements represented by ancient stones, forms an Ultimate Weapon with
which to destroy Evil. Unfortunately, the villainous Mr Zorg (Gary
Oldman) is hunting for the stones alongside his alien mercenaries.
Before long, she seeks help from cab-driver Korben Dallas (Bruce
Willis) who quickly finds himself thrown into an intergalactic hunt for
the stones.<br /><br />I must have seen this film several times (but never all the way through
until last night) and it is certainly as confusing as it is silly. The
plot, such as it is, comes across as being somewhat simplistic although
it isn&#x27;t helped by fast-moving action and dialogue. Chris Tucker is
almost incomprehensible as the fast-talking, fast-loving,
larger-than-life Ruby Rhod. But for all the madness going on, you
cannot help but admire the look of it. Whether it is the eye-catching
costume designs by Jean-Paul Gaultier or the pseudo-retro vision of a
colourful and camp future, &#x22;The Fifth Element&#x22; is a stunning feast for
the eyes and remains alone as one of the best looking films in recent
years.<br /><br />With regards to the fantastic cast, nearly everybody gives it their
all. Milla Jovovich is brilliant as the gibberish-spouting super-being
and despite not having the strongest character, Oldman&#x27;s vile Texan
baddie is well portrayed. But this is a quirky slice of science fiction
and will not appeal to everybody. The only constant is the visuals -
the comic moments are few and far between, the sheer number of
characters is staggering and the pace of the film veers from break-neck
to handbrake. It&#x27;s such a difficult film to analyse - my Better Half
enjoys it more than I do but she&#x27;s less of a sci-fi fan than myself.
Depending on where you stand, this is either one of the best sci-fi
films ever made or it&#x27;s a horribly muddled mass of French insanity.
Besson has never been the same since but however you look at it, this
is strictly a one-off film that&#x27;s impossible to ignore.
