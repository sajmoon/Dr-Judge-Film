I logged on to IMDB tonight because I happened to catch 20 minutes or so
of
an Uma Thurman film that turned out to be &quot;Even Cowgirls Get the Blues.&quot;
What I saw of it was so horrible that I was not surprised to see an
almost
unanimous line of unfavorable comments. Had I seen all of the movie, I
would
probably have re-thought my list of Top 5 Worst Ever.<br /><br />Since that list was formed in my head before IMDB came along, I've never
checked out what other folks thought about the films I would place there,
so
I immediately thought, &quot;Let's see what people have to say about 'Fifth
Element.'&quot; Imagine my surprise to find very favorable - no, I'd say
&quot;glowing&quot; - comments about this dogpile of a movie. I respect anyone's
right
to an opinion, especially about a creative field like movie-making, but I
just have to suggest that either I or they were smoking some serious
crack
while watching it, because there is no way we're talking about the same
two
hours of our lives.<br /><br />Oh, wait, they are talking about that shrill, unfunny Ruby Rod character
(compares to Jar Jar Binks in extreme annoyance, now that I think about
it),
so I guess we saw the same movie. Now, I like odd, off-key movies as much
as
the next &quot;World According to Garp&quot; or &quot;How to Get Ahead in Advertising&quot;
fan,
but I honestly have to say that &quot;Fifth Element&quot; ranks up there on the
Worst
Ever list with &quot;Orlando,&quot; &quot;Spaceballs&quot; and &quot;Full Metal Jacket.&quot; (Yes, I
am a
Kubrick fan, so describing his too-little/too-late &quot;wasn't Vietnam a bad
thing?&quot; brutality festival a Worst Ever film is painful.)<br /><br />In short, sometimes Weird is Good, but sometimes Weird just plain
Stinks.
