1999_October 2 

This movie is probably one of the best Bruce Willis performances
ever, he left the rest of the cast standing (although Milla Jovovich's
performance as Leeloo was very good).  The costumes were excellent as were
the effects.  The only let down, was Gary Oldman's false teeth and the
plastic thing he wore on his head....  I have watched this 6 times and it
just gets better and better.
