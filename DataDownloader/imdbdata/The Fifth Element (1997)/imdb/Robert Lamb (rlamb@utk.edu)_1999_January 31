1999_January 31 

Stupid movie all the way. Evidence:
1 Every costume in the whole frig'n movie
2 the mere presence of Bruce Willis
3 Giant golden alien-robot Duck people
4 dog-people
5 Gary Oldman's kinky muppet pet
6 a movie about true love conquering all
7 Zeus plays the president.
8 Zeus plays the president (a major offence.)
9 unexplained hershey's choclate syrup dripping on people's foreheads. What
the hec was that about. It was brown, was not blood, and was dripping on
their heads!?!?!
10 good actors wasted in movie
11 claimed ot be this generation's star wars
12 that Blue opera singing squid woman<br /><br />I could go on. I did not like this movie and it seemed pointless to me. But,
some people like it. That's fine, but there are plenty of better sci-fi
movies to see.
