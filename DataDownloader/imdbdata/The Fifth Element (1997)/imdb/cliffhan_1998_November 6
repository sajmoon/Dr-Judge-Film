1998_November 6 

This is one of my favorite flicks. It's not typical Hollywood
cookie-cutter fare. Cool music, interesting and strange
aliens,
and original and rememberable characters. They didn't spend
a
trillion dollars on SPFX, but that's okay. This was not a
movie
written by committee. It was obviously one person's vision
where
the studio did not butt in and screw it up. It helps that
Bruce
Willis is one of my favorite actors, but the supporting cast
was
excellent as well. Like Blade Runner, it wasn't a box office
cash cow, but again, that's okay. True Science Fiction fans
are
used to being lonely.
