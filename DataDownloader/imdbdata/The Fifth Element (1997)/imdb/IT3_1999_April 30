1999_April 30 

Bruce Willis is one of my favorite 
actors because all the movies he's 
been in are great.  Some examples are 
Armeggedon,and the Die Hard movies.  This is definitelly not a movie that
would change my mind about that!!!  This is probably his best performance
yet (although Armeggedon is a close tye.) with dazzling special effects,
superb acting, and a great script this is my favorite movie
ever!!!!
