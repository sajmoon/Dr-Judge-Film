This is a crazy and unique movie, the cast is great, as are many of the
effects. The storyline and mood is very original, have to love it. i
would also like to point out that I found it amazing that Bruce Willis
and Milla Jovovich have great chemistry this movie. They are a very
unlikely pair. Chris Tucker, although he was annoying at times, was
funny and kept the feel of the movie alive. korben's mom also did to a
certain degree. the movie is completely rewatchable for some odd
reason. there is so much satire in it that I've watched it nearly ten
times and still find out some funny little detail I didn't notice the
last time that I watched it. the movie is just fantastic.
