The people who hate this movie make me laugh, if you go to user
comments you'll find that no one in the &quot;hated it&quot; category has any
actual reason for hating it (except for the feminist, but lets not get
into that) The only reason people don't like this movie is because so
much of Hollywood has morphed them into &quot;ultra realism&quot; tight wads that
they can't respect and enjoy real cheesy entertainment anymore. The
acting is awesome, the writing is clever, and the sets and special
effects are beautiful. Relax, sit back, and let your peevish
scrutinizing little brain rest for a hour and 45 minutes and you'll
find that this really is a fun, energetic, vibrant film.<br /><br />mad props to the director 8 out of 10
