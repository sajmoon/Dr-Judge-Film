The 5th Element is a firework of images, and I really enjoyed it very
much.
Sure, at the end it's &quot;Bruce-Willis-saves-the-world&quot;, but in the meantime,
the acting especially of Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich is great and
sometimes breathtaking. You can see the french influence by Luc Besson and
Jean-Paul Gaultier in every single second of this great film. It's SciFi
for
those who don't like SciFi and it's also great for SciFi-Fans.
A great film, so I gave it a 9.
