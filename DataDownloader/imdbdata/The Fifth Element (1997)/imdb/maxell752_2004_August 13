I never get tired of watching this movie. About a year ago I realized
that &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; had become my favorite movie of all time.
Which sort of surprised me as big a fan of Star Trek and James Bond
that I am. My 3 year old loves this movie too. Milla just looks so
incredibly good with orange hair. I've not seen her look as good in any
movie since. The flight attendants look awesome with their snow-white
hair as well. Maybe its all the pretty girls looking so good that makes
me like it so much. Well..no, there's so much more to this film than
simply pretty girls, its got wonderful plot turns, and its so
imaginative...that's what I like about it. Now if I could only find my
multi-pass....
