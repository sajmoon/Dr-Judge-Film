I really enjoyed The Fifth Element.  It is visually stunning with a story
way out of this universe.  Everyone does a really good job of preserving
their character, not matter how ridiculous it all must have seen.  With a
pounding soundtrack, and quick snazzy dialogue viewers are in for a real
treat.  The film should be seen on the big screen, as it does lose a bit
of
its impact on video.  This film takes an unusual approach to the science
fiction genre, which is what makes it so refreshing- though I can see why
its not for all tastes.
