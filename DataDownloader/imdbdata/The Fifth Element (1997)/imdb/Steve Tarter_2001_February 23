Bruce Willis powers through a film that's part comedy and all fantasy.
Surprise--it works.  Would have to rate among the top 10 sci-fi films of the
90's--not that the designation means a whole lot.  The good thing about this
movie is that it allows for a sense of humor/humanity in the future instead
of the cartoon cutouts we've been spoon-fed in the Star Wars series.
