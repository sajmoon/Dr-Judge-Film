While I had missed out on this on initial release and various TV
airings over the years, it now ended up being my second BluRay viewing!
It was Bruce Willis&#x27; second of 3 sci-fi epics made in the space of as
many years &#x96; the others being the superior TWELVE MONKEYS (1995) and
the even lesser Armageddon (1998). Luc Besson often dabbled in fantasy
and, though re-united with Gary Oldman from LEON (1994), this proved
the French director&#x27;s first real brush with Hollywood.<br /><br />The film is redolent of two earlier genre landmarks, namely STAR WARS
(1977; in its plethora of monstrous characters) and BLADE RUNNER (1982;
the &#x27;chaotic&#x27; look); plot-wise, it owes a bit to RAIDERS OF THE LOST
ARK (1981) given the danger-fraught odyssey relating to an
archaeological find. Casting, too, channels famous (musical/film)
personalities with Oldman&#x27;s campy villain evoking David Bowie, while
Chris Tucker&#x27;s outrageous but irrelevant TV show host brings to mind
Prince!; in a similar key, actors from earlier classic sci-fi titles
have been recruited: Ian Holm from ALIEN (1979), Brion James from BLADE
RUNNER itself and John Neville who, though best-known for THE
ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN (1989), was also the lead of the
low-budgeted but superb UNEARTHLY STRANGER (1963).<br /><br />As expected, the film looks great (showcasing imaginative
production/costume design and special effects) and, while the central
theme is interesting (if hardly original), the ending is a
disappointment: Oldman is dispatched before the climax and by his own
volatile &#x27;thugs&#x27; to boot, whereas a super alien promising a showdown
with the Forces of Good is conveniently dealt with by the ray of light
unleashed when the mythic five elements come together in Egypt (some
form of direct confrontation would not have been amiss at this point)!
Incidentally, the ruse of forcing Willis (here sporting blond hair) to
admit his love for heroine Milla Jovovich obviously rips-off the finale
of Howard Hawks&#x27; RIO BRAVO (1959) &#x96; just as the couple&#x27;s lovemaking
being interrupted by suddenly adulating authority figures smacks of the
James Bond movies! By the way, Besson would probably be deemed a
visionary now, not so much for his futuristic films, but for daring to
make the American President a black man (though DEEP IMPACT {1998} soon
after employed the very same device)! <br /><br />The film, then, is action-packed, thus reasonably entertaining, but it
also contains a number of flaws &#x96; mainly Tucker&#x27;s embarrassing and
overbearing character and the supreme silliness of having an alien for
a singing operatic diva (actually, the whole over-the-top section on
the flying cruise-liner was a mistake)! On the other hand, Jovovich and
Oldman (helped in no small measure by their respectively sparse and
gaudy attire) are a delight throughout and the main reason for watching
this...
