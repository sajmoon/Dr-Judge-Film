The trick is intellect. If you have one, you will enjoy this film many
times.<br /><br />If you expect to be bludgeoned with action and a simple story line go watch
a movie that does that.<br /><br />True love will save the universe. People go on about Besson. Ok it's his
movie, but, it's the story that makes it.<br /><br />He gets the girl. She gets the guy, bad guy is toast, authority figures get
tweaked, bullets laser beams and bombs at every turn. Ooops I forgot, major
league babes, nut ball costumes, what else is there? Badaboom. Milla is hot
in a big way.<br /><br />Please refrain from showing how little you know by knocking a movie that you
know nothing about.
