This movie is pure eye-candy. Sure, the plot is a little simplistic, but
it's so well-executed that you don't really care. The soundtrack and
costumes are inventive. This movie doesn't take itself too seriously
(unlike the old chestnuts in the Star Wars train) and has snappy dialogue
(unlike the clunky dreck that George Lucas doles out).<br /><br />It's great fun seeing Derek Jacoby hop around, Gary Oldman play the
sinister
but hokey villain, and of course Milla Jovovich and Bruce Willis are easy
on
the eyes. The Diva is mesmerising.
The Ruby Rod character gets too much screentime.
