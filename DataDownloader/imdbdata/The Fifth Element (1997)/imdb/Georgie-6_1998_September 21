1998_September 21 

While I'm a big SW fan, I have found the Fifth Element far more enjoyable to
watch.
I think the story moves along better and the characters are vastly more
entertaining to watch.
As for the special effects, I was spellbounded by the vastness of the city.
I didn't think the SFX overwhelmed the movie as most would
say.
It's a clever story, it's about love, the most powerful force in the
universe. Anyone could possess it, unlike the Force of the SW
triolgies.
