Two hundred and fifty years in the future, life as we know it is threatened
by the arrival of Evil. Only the fifth element (played by Milla Jovovich)
can stop the Evil from extinguishing life, as it tries to do every five
thousand years. She is helped by ex-soldier, current-cab-driver, Corben
Dallas (played by Bruce Willis), who is, in turn, helped by Prince/Arsenio
clone, Ruby Rohd. Unfortunately, Evil is being assisted by Mr. Zorg (Gary
Oldman), who seeks to profit from the chaos that Evil will bring, and his
alien Mercenaries. The Fifth Element should be seen by all sci-fi film
enthusiasts. It is absolutely loaded with an incredible jumble of eye candy.
One amazing spectacle after another leaps onto the screen to thrill us. It
is laced with very rich imagery, and demands repeated viewing to take in all
the details thanks to great direction by French director Luc Besson. The
story is a disaster and I had to watch this film 2 times to appreciate it,
and now I love it. Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman and Milla Jovovich are superb
in their acting and there are only few problems with the film thatare not
importent.
