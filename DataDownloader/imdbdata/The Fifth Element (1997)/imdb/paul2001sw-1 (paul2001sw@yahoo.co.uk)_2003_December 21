For the first few minutes of this film, you may believe you are watching an
earnest, but desperately hammy, sci-fi thriller.  Thankfully, this
impression is soon dispelled. 'The Fifth Element' is simply the most pure
comic-book creation on celluloid since Flash Gordon, taking from that medium
not just the tedious plotting and flimsy scenarios of most examples of this
genre, but also a spirit of vivid, and visual, comic imagination.  This is
not a serious movie.  But it is inventive, frequently funny and has a sly
satirical sense reminiscent of 'The Hitch Hikers' Guide to the Galaxy'. 
Certainly better than 'Men In Black'.
