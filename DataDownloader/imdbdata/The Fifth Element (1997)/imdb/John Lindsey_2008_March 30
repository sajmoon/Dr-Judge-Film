Set in the far distant future, a cab driver named Korben Dallas (Bruce
Willis) had a tough life until one day he meets an unusual fare that
fell into his cab. It&#39;s a lovely female alien named Leeloo (Milla
Jovovich) whom was really a secret experiment as she is known to be the
ultimate weapon against evil. She with Korben must try to save the
world from a destructive force that will destroy humanity as their are
four important element stones and she is the fifth one to stop it,
along their way they meet a cast of colorful characters such as Ruby
Rod (Chris Tucker), Cornelius (Ian Holm) and the dastardly Zorg (Gary
Oldman).<br /><br />From Luc Besson (director of &quot;Leon The Professional&quot; and &quot;La Femme
Nikita&quot;) comes a totally dazzling, colorful and wonderful Sci-fi comedy
action fantasy epic that has became a cult fave since 1997. Luc Besson
has always dreamed about doing this movie since he was a teenager, it
finally came true with this visually stunning movie that is packed with
non-stop action, great performances, surprise humor, impressive special
effects, cool aliens, great music score and this is one of my all time
favorite movies.<br /><br />A must see movie!
