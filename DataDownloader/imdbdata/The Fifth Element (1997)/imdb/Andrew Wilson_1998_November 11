The 5th Element left me stunned with surprise. It's witty, funny script put
together with action packed screenplay made for an excellent film. Luc
Besson directed the world's best sci-fi farse. And a brilliant one at that.
The movie's seriousness almost makes fun of all the sci-fi's of the past.
Add to this the excellent acting of Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich and, of
course Gary Oldman, my favourite, and the result is the best movie ever
made. It makes you laugh, jump up and down on your seat, eat popcorn like
never before and feel like you're actually a part of the
film.<br /><br />There is definitely no future without it.
