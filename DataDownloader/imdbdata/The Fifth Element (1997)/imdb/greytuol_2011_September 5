2011_September 5 
Having recently reviewed a number of Sci-Fi Movies, I had become
increasingly bored of the senile story lines and lack of fun that is
what a film lover such as myself requires on a regular basis. So, off i
rummage through my movie catalogue and &#x27;There it is!&#x27; - The Fifth
Element. at the conclusion, i felt like a kid who had literally been
spoilt in a candy store.<br /><br />For me, the Fifth Element is as crazy as it can be average. But PLEASE!
do not let this sway you from a film that was written by Luc Besson
when he was in school. The outfits are mad, Bruce Willis is (dare i say
it...) lovable and the complete idea is ludicrous; yet it makes me want
to watch over and over again. It is a feel good action movie that
delights me every time and helps me to forget that recent movies are
becoming quick money making marvels without any entertainment value.<br /><br />Luc Besson! this may not be your greatest work, but you sure know how
to please your audience! And to me, thats what matters most. To my
readers, understand that it is silly, and just sit back and enjoy this
Jean-Paul Gaultier gun slinging sexy Sci-Fi.
