The Fifth Element is a great sci-fi film, a blend of wonderful visual
effects, great acting and an easy to follow, interesting script.  The cast
brings life to their characters.  Bruce Willis easily fell into his role as
Korben Dallas, so well that it did not seem like you were watching Bruce
Willis.  Milla Jovovich was awesome as the Perfect creature in the universe,
Ian Holm was realistic, Chris Tucker was annoying but hilarious (Bzzzzz! is
classic to sci-fi fans) and Gary Oldman just totally hysterical as
Zorg.<br /><br />People might think that the characters and the setting is taken straight
from comic book pages.  In a way it is, but in other ways it resembles our
Earth.  Like Dune and the old Star Wars Trilogy, it paints for us a surreal
picture of civilization (in this case ours in the near future) in a way the
new Star Wars films fail to achieve.  The costuming, the designs for the
hovering cars, the Paradise Planet, the so-called 'celebrities' of the time,
and the Diva concert all add to a unique and odd culture that keeps the
movie going in the blurry spots on the plot.  The aliens are different from
your average sci-fi movie aliens, and the techno music score is
sweet.<br /><br />The plot is simple and not too original, but it does keep you going most of
the time.  Admittedly, the beginning is pretty boring and it might take some
effort to keep non-sci-fi fans in their seats.  But otherwise, the story is
fun and the script is loaded with laughs.<br /><br />I rate this 9.5 out of 10.  Go out and buy on DVD or VHS.  This is
definitely one of the better examples of sci-fi.
