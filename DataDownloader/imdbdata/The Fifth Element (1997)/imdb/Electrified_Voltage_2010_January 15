2010_January 15 
This is a popular sci-fi blockbuster from 1997, but I was a few months
shy of eleven years old at the time of its release, and was totally
unaware of its existence until several years later. I saw some of it at
least twice during my high school years, but the first time I saw the
entire film was in 2005 (shortly after finishing high school), and from
what I remember, I was a little disappointed. Maybe I didn&#x27;t exactly
think it was bad, but it certainly didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. After
over four years, I finally watched it from start to finish a second
time, and as I had hoped, it was definitely better this time. There
were some things I couldn&#x27;t remember from my first viewing, especially
towards the end, but as well as being better, my second viewing was
also more memorable.<br /><br />Every five thousand years, a great evil comes and threatens all life in
the Universe! Four stones (representing fire, air, water, and earth)
and a living being known as the Fifth Element together make the only
weapon that can stop it! In 1914, three hundred years before this great
evil is to return, an extraterrestrial group called the Mondoshawan
come to Earth to take the Elements from an ancient tomb in Egypt and
keep them safe. Three hundred years later, in an era of flying cars,
the Mondoshawan attempt to return to Earth, but are killed by evil
aliens called Mangalores! Scientists find a portion of the Fifth
Element in the remains of the Mondoshawan ship, and use a machine to
recreate it. It comes to life in the form of a human female named
Leeloo, who escapes from the laboratory and falls into the backseat of
a taxi driven by Korben Dallas, a former military man. He takes her to
a priest named Father Vito Cornelius, who knows just who/what she is
after he sees the mark on her arm! The priest is searching for the
other four elements, but so is the evil Zorg, who has different plans
for them! <br /><br />I may not have found this movie very suspenseful the first time I
watched it all, but the same cannot be said about the second time. I
found a lot of it suspenseful this time, with all the action, starting
during the opening sequence, set in 1914 Egypt, and continuing for much
of the rest of the film, set in the 23rd century. To add to the quality
of &#x22;The Fifth Element&#x22;, there are good performances here from Bruce
Willis, Milla Jovovich, Ian Holm, Gary Oldman, etc. The film also has
some humour, sometimes funny and sometimes not so much. The &#x22;bada boom&#x22;
part is pretty annoying, and Chris Tucker as Ruby Rhod isn&#x27;t a very
good comic relief. I may not have found him nearly as annoying as some
people probably have, but his antics can be pretty lame. However, there
is some good humour, with Zorg (Oldman&#x27;s character, a better comic
relief), Korben hiding military personnel in his fridge, etc. I tend to
really like the visuals in these modern sci-fi blockbusters, with the
sets and special effects, and the visuals here are no exception.
Finally, towards the end, there are some fairly moving scenes.<br /><br />This is not a film I&#x27;ve ever been able to describe as a masterpiece,
but after watching it twice, I think it deserves a lot of praise. I&#x27;m
not sure why I wasn&#x27;t that impressed the first time. Maybe I wasn&#x27;t
exactly in the right mood, or maybe I had to see it again in order to
understand its popularity. Well, whatever the reason was, it definitely
improved with a second viewing, as some movies do, and I think I now
understand why it&#x27;s so popular, even if I don&#x27;t like it as much as many
others clearly do. Sure, some of the humour doesn&#x27;t work (some Chris
Tucker gags included), the romance between Korben and Leeloo is
sometimes a little cheesy, and those may not be the only two flaws, but
apart from that, there&#x27;s not much I can criticize &#x22;The Fifth Element&#x22;
for. If you like a good sci-fi adventure, many would obviously agree
that this one is worth a look.
