I have to say that luc besson did a fantastic job of creating a stylish
and effects bizarre extravaganza for everybody.This film blew me away
when i first saw it,and it still does when i have a chance to watch
it.Bruce Willis is as always cool as a cucumber,and having a motley
crue of help with a priest and supreme being which is to save the world
really gave the audience a new way of how we view the universe.Chris
tucker was excellent as the comedy side kick who could still at the
worst moments be brave enough to keep the peace in his own way.It&#39;s the
question we can all ask,&#39;Where did we come from?,where are we
going?,how long do we have?&#39;.The fundamentals of being in this universe
and knowing there could be a helper or watcher so to speak,gives most
who believe,the hope we all strive for.And Luc Besson did not spare
those questions,such as the supreme being that is fragile,built for war
or peace,resulting in a weapon to save mankind.Or in fact universe
kind,still the film was brilliant in all aspects,with aliens of
hostility to ones with crystal clear operatic voices sounding like an
angel when singing.For those who have not seen this film,do it,you will
not be disappointed.
