this movie is so perfectly over-the-top. the visuals are absolutely
stunning, the music is exactly what i&#39;d hope to hear in a dazzling
techno-future, the script is both funny and extremely clever... but the
part that really surprised me was the... editing? i don&#39;t think i&#39;ve
ever actually tried to pay attention to the editing of a film, and if i
catch myself doing it, it&#39;s usually a bad sign. i enjoy watching the
film and noting how they tie the scenes together with sly little hints
here and there. i appreciate the diva&#39;s performance scene, as it cuts
between the opera hall and her suite in the hotel, both with the
imagery and music/dialogue. the way these hints are placed is very well
done, never cheapening the next scene.<br /><br />let me also note that the characters these actors developed are
marvelous. i know that some people dislike Chris Tucker&#39;s &quot;ruby rhod&quot;,
but what would you expect from a radio personality in the 23rd century?
of COURSE it&#39;s going to be intense. and it&#39;s not just the main
characters. i mean, Bruce Willis does his standard action hero wise-guy
that you&#39;d expect, which is a good thing. Milla Jovovich is fantastic,
with her fluent &quot;divine language&quot; and smokin&#39; hotness. Gary Oldman,
ever the chameleon, plays a great villain even if i still can&#39;t figure
out WHY his character is trying to antagonize the heroes. but the
smaller role players practically steal the show. the priest and his
assistant are hilarious, the Chinese food guy is funny, but the best
performance by anyone in the whole flick is the mugger at korben&#39;s
(Willis&#39;) apartment. it&#39;s one of those quick scenes that&#39;s memorable
enough to become a great inside-joke type voicemail i can leave for any
of my friends to make sure they laugh when they hear it.<br /><br />it&#39;s a must see. buy it or just never return it to netflix.
