This film features one of the best mixes of action, fantasy and humor I
have
seen in a movie.<br /><br />Gary Oldman, as always, is the bad guy. Milla Jovovich does her job well
beyond her incredible beauty, and even Bruce Willis seems to be the perfect
hero.<br /><br />Is it me, or there is a lot of Star Wars allusions?<br /><br />A must see. And a good candidate for my private collection.
