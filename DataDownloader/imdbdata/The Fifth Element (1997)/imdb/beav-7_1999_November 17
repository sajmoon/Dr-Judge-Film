1999_November 17 

The first time I saw this film I disliked it... After seeing it
approximately 1/2 dozen more times on cable (must have gotten a real deal on
it)... it grew on me more and more, almost to cult status with myself and
friends... if you were able to surgically extract tucker from the film I
would call it very good, and besides can holm and oldman ever be bad in
anything?
