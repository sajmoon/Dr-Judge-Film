Watching The Fifth Element is like riding a roller coaster, it's best to
hang on and enjoy the 
ride.  The film is filled with lush, wild visions of the future.  New York
is a even more bustling 
metropolis.  Filled with flying vehicles pack the city skyline so deep, you
wonder how anyone 
manages to fly in that traffic.  Outfits that look like they sprung from a
combination of a 
nightmare and fantasy adorn the denizens of Earth, and various other
planets, 250 years in the 
future.  Bruce Willis plays a cabbie who has the task of saving the world
from ultimate evil.  
Piece of cake compared to driving a cab in New York.  Luc Besson manages to
pack every scene 
with so much detail, it's staggering to watch for the first time.  Sure it's
a bit silly, and if you 
stop and analyze it too much, the film falls apart.  But that's not why he
made it.  The Fifth 
Element is a thrill ride pure and simple.  You have action, fantastic
visuals, a really weird sense 
of humor, (courtesy of Chris Tucker's performance) and an over the top
villain.  You'll have your 
ups and downs but overall, you'll enjoy the ride, and want to go back again.
