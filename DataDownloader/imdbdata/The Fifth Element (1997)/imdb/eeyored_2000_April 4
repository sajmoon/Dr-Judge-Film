Okay there are some real faults with this film, like its tendency to go a
little too far into silliness, which becomes a problem when the film wants
to then be serious, but all in all its good points out weigh its
bad.<br /><br />A couple good points: This movie is visually stunning, a fresh view in
sci-fi. A welcomed change from the dark trashiness that has been watered
down and done to death.<br /><br />The story is a pretty original. The editing is particularly good. Pay
attention to the ends of scenes, because what ever was talked about in the
end of a scene is exactly what the next scene is. The impact this has on the
energy of the film is easy to overlook and disregard as
obvious.<br /><br />The effects are of course good. They should be considering how many effects
houses worked on it and how much this film cost.<br /><br />The acting is good. Bruce Willis is of course Bruce Willis.
Gary Oldman is as usual a pleasure to watch. That little piece of plastic on
his head is annoying though. I suppose it was put there to make him look
silly. However he already looked kinda  weird without his patented evil man
goatee.<br /><br />I would say the worst part and completely unnecessary and out of place part
of this film is Chris Rock's character. Oh was he annoying. He runs toe to
toe with Jar Jar Binks as worst character to almost ruin a movie.<br /><br />I don't know why Luc Besson put him in there. Maybe to poke fun at
Americans. All it does is once that overt reference is gone (about five
seconds after appears) is leave us with an annoying and overbearing
character you just wish would die in a crossfire.<br /><br />Take him away and some other out of place cheesiness (like that stupid
creature in Gary Oldman's desk) and you have a perfect
movie.<br /><br />So if you want a near perfect sci-fi/action/comedy movie and can handle
these sometimes annoying imperfections rent or buy this.<br /><br />Not exactly thinking man's sci-fi, but neither were most of the Star Wars
movies.<br /><br />I would equate this with Episode I. Only this was better because it didn't
have all that extra baggage.
