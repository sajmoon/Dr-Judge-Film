I find it AMAZING that there are so many comments for this film that
unfortunately didn&#39;t do all that well in &#39;97. I was a new mom when this
movie was released in the U.S., so I missed it in the theaters. What a
shame! But one of my friends saw it and told me that it was a must see.
I had to wait another couple of years before finally catching it on
cable and he was so right; I loved this film immediately.<br /><br />I know it&#39;s campy and silly and very illogical. But those that hold it
to the standard of a drama just don&#39;t get the point. It&#39;s a joyous film
with themes of love, duty and courage.<br /><br />The casting was superb, Milla Jovovich and Bruce Willis are a perfect
match. The rest of the cast is great also; Chis Tucker and Gary Oldman
are insanely funny. Oldman&#39;s funky southern accent is hilarious! <br /><br />All I can say is that this movie will brighten a bad day -that alone is
a testament to good movie-making.
