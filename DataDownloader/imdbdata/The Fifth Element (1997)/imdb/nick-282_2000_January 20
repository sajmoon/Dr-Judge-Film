This not a Hollywood film - it is wild, it is colorful, and it is crazy, and
more than anything, it is an individual vision, something Hollywood has not
allowed since the glorious old days.  You will be throughly sick of Chris
Rock's over the top DJ by the end of the movie, but other than that, Milla
Jovovich is mysterious and beautiful, Bruce Willis is himself, and Ian Holm
scores yet again and as the actor with an uncanny sense of what scripts are
going to turn into extraordinary movies.<br /><br />In my opinion, not since Orson Welles was let loose in the Universal back
lot to make Citizen Kane has there been such a fine example of youthful
cinematic genius. Forget maturity, go back to being a teenager for a couple
of hours; you won't get arrested.
