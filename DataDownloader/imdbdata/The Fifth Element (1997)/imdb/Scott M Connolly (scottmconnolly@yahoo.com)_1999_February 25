1999_February 25 

Busson does his usual excellent and new work with a wonderful cast, theme;
fine music of the Arabic world placed in a futuristic context [influence of
the French Islamac immigration and his own].<br /><br />Effective special effects and an imaginative wardrobe of Gaultier fashions
of the future.<br /><br />Willis a fine starring role ... and the future is saved for ore of
Leeloo?
