There is not much praise I can give this film that has not already been
given. Everything from the sets and costumes to the casting and acting is
spot on. The relationship between Corben and Leelu is tangible, with
brilliant supporting roles from Oldman, Holme and Tucker.
I felt at the time of its release, The Fifth Element was was terribly
under-publicised, and this led me to believe it would have a common
hollywood flaw of being a good idea on an insubstantial budget, but this is
far from true- all of the effects are fine. Plenty of involving imagery,
direction and writing to bring you back for repeated enjoyment.
