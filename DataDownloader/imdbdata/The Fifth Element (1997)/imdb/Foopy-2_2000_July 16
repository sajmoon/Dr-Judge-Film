The dialogue is horrible.  The characters are cardboard cutouts, formed from
mixes of genre stereotypes and characters from bad Mel Brooks movies, and
none of them are really developed at all through the whole film, with the
possible exception of Leloo.  Because of these things, it was impossible for
me to care whatsoever for any of them.<br /><br />The theme of the film--basically that we should make love, not war--is
ignored for most of the movie and then shoved in our faces at the very end
in a very trite manner.  The romance between Willis and Jovovich is
extremely underdeveloped.  Although many of the things that happen in the
movie are funny, many of them are also rather predictable and a few even
seem like they were taken directly from an episode of Full
House.<br /><br />The film did have its positives, though.  The visuals were gorgeous, and the
direction (cinematography and editing) was quite nice.  The junk airship was
really cool.  Watching Leloo make chicken was very funny.<br /><br />But all that wasn't enough to make this movie any better than mediocre. 
Altogether, this movie is very shallow, predictable, and because the
characters weren't developed enough for me to care for them throughout the
course of the film, it was very boring to sit through.
