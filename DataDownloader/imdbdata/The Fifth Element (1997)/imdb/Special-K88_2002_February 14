Wild, wacky, over-the-top futuristic action movie/sci-fi saga from
director Luc Besson. In the very distant future, disillusioned
ex-military officer turned cab driver Willis crosses paths with a
perfect supreme being (Jovovich) whose existence could be the key to
saving humanity from the ultimate evil. With the help of her, a wise
but bumbling priest, and a cocky, self-centered DJ, the race is on to
save the world before it&#39;s too late. So much humor that the film is
borderline silly at times, but the story is fascinating, the action
scenes first-rate, and the futuristic images spectacular. A little bit
of everything rolled into one makes this a film you can enjoy time and
time again. ***
