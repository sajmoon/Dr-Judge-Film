This is one of those rare movies that has it all: an interesting story
(albeit kind of cartoonish), great actors, great costumes.<br /><br />The story is about a man named Corban Dallas (Bruce Willis), who has been
chosen to save the world of &quot;the ultimate evil&quot;, with the help of &quot;the
fifth
element&quot; - the perfect being, played by Mila Jovovich.
The oter actors include the hilarious Chris Tucker, Ian Holm, and Gary
Oldman in his usual type of performance.
The cast for this movie is perfect, all of the cast giving brilliant
performances. Bruce Willis couldn't be more perfect for this
role.<br /><br />The direction in the movie is quite simply, superb. Luc Besson does a
fantastic job creating a believeable future, while not out rageous, is
quite
unique.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is one of those movies that makes you feel good, with
great one-liners, excellent actors, and the feeling that the movie doesn't
take itself too seriously.<br /><br />3.5\4
