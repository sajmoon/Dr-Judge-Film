It was just too preposterous. I realize that that is supposed to be one of
 its attractions. The computer generated effects were dazzling but I have
 had enough of oddities with animal or what have you faces. It was too long

 to shine. And when I learned that it had been written by someone in high
 school, and later on he took it upon himself to prepare it for the screen,
 I saw the first mistake. No, I gave it a 3.
