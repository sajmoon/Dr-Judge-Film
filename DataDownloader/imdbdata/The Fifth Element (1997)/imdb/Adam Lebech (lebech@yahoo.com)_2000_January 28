Possibly the best sci-fi movie of the 90s. Visually impressive and original
set in colorful, futuristic universe taken from French comic books. The
universe is a mixture of that found in the Christin/M&eacute;zi&egrave;res comic book
series Val&eacute;rian and in some of Moebius's works with some hints from
Japanese
comic books as well (Both M&eacute;zi&egrave;res and Moebius (Jean Giraud) were involved
in the design). Imaginative costume design by Jean-Paul Gaultier gives the
movie a very distinct an innovative style.<br /><br />I can easily understand why so many people don't like the film because it
is
so heavily focused on style and impressive sets, and few Americans have had
the opportunity to get acquainted with the French-language comic book
tradition which ads a special flavor to the movie. It is a mystery to me
why
so few of the high quality French and Belgian comic books have been
published in America (most of these comic books have even been published in
my native language Danish).<br /><br />My problem with the movie was a bit the same I had with the Jar Jar Binks
character int the Phantom Menace. I really don't like ill-placed humour in
sci-fi movies. Some of the &quot;funny&quot; scenes with the bad guy (Gary Oldman)
are
misplaced, and the president is seriously miscast. Maybe it is wrong to
blame Besson since the inappropriate use of childish humour is not only a
problem in this movie, but also in the unfortunate development of the
Val&eacute;rian comics it has been influenced by. Moebius has a strong sense of
humour, but in a very strange and surreal way that the movie doesn't even
try to copy.<br /><br />Because of these flaws The Fifth Element cannot reach Blade Runner which I
would consider the best sci-fi ever made. Interestingly enough, some of the
earlier, darker, and more ideological oriented sci-fi comics by
Christin/M&eacute;zi&egrave;res have some of the same qualities as Ridley Scott's
masterpiece. If there is a sci-fi director out there in need of a good
idea,
check out some of the Val&eacute;rian comics from the 70s.
