Enough action, laughs, and special effects to be entertaining, and short
enough to watch over and over. The Fifth Element delivers it all. It
provides an interesting look at the future, and supports it with an
intriguing story. High-energy action, good performances (Gary Oldman was a
trip)and some great wisecracks flow throughout this film. A solid, sci-fi
adventure. 3/4
