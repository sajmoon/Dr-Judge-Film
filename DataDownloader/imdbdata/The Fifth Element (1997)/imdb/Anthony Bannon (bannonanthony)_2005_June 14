I wanted to see this movie ever since I saw trailers for it and I must
say that it's still up there as one of my favourite sci-fi/action
movies. Bruce Willis (with the surgically-attached vest of his) is
great as our hero Korben Dallas and is supported by a cast of excellent
performers such as Ian Holm, Gary Oldman, the late Brion James etc.
Fans of AUF WIEDERSIEHN PET should look out for Chris 'Moxey' Fairbank
as a scientist. The aliens in the film (The Mondoshawans, Mangalores
and Diva Plavalaguna) are brilliantly realised and the action scenes
such as the flying car chase and the all-out gun battle in the space
hotel are staged brilliantly.<br /><br />I will never get tired of this movie. Be warned however that there is
one blot on the landscape. THat blot's name is Chris Tucker. Don't get
me wrong, I have seen both the RUSH HOUR movies and I thought he was
very good in them, but here he is just annoying and obnoxious. Then
again, that's probably the point as his character, DJ Ruby Rhod, is
annoying and obnoxious. But with that one gripe aside, the film is
brilliant.
