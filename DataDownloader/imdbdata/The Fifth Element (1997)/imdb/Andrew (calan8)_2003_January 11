I have one word.  Style.  On the page, and even with the principal cast
&quot;star&quot; list, &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; is one of those summer blockbusters
designed to make the studios a big buck and then vanish.  But like
&quot;Seven&quot;,
when in the hands of a master director something else happens.  They
apply
style, and suddenly you have something stunning.<br /><br />Every facet of this film fits with every other facet.  You take take a
single frame from the film and you just &quot;know&quot; it's &quot;The Fifth
Element&quot;.<br /><br />That's style.  And style matters more than character OR plot.  What do
compelling characters or intricate plots matter if you can unify them in
the
style of the story-telling?<br /><br />When &quot;The Matrix&quot; came out die hard anime fans rejoiced that this film
had
managed to bring the comic book into real life.  But they seem to have
forgotten &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;.  Because &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; is exactly
that,
with it's plots, characters, production design, and framing, it's
editing,
everything about it screams comic book.  Once again it all comes back to
style.<br /><br />It's just a pity that when audiences see a film that has one of those
&quot;blockbuster&quot; actors in it they automatically and instantly class the
film
as a mere &quot;blockbuster&quot; bit of mindless entertainment and are then unable
to
ever see the film for its real worth.
