1999_December 16 

Upon reading about 40 reviews of this movie here, I must say I am completely
floored by how many people really loved it. The only reason I sat through
the entire film was because I was watching it in a class and we were forced
to. Visually interesting, I'll grant that, but painfully boring.  I think
this is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.
