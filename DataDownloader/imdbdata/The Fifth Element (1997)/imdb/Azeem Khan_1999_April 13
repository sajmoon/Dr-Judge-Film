1999_April 13 

This movie is simply unbelievable. From the outrageous costumes of John-Paul
Gautier to the absolutely stunning futuristic city
and the fabulously amazing music, this movie has it all. The actors portray
the role pretty well especially Milla. The story is ok but the execution of
the story is great. The only thing that could have made this movie better
was Jean Reno in a tragic role. This is one of my all-time favourite
movies...
