If you are tired, like SF movies and feel like watching something light,
this  film is recommendable.  It is not deep and the movie is slanted
towards superficial suspense, visual effects and humor.  It does not
measure
up to movies like 'Blade Runner', in my opinion, but does not have the dark
overtones which makes for lighter entertainment, if you are in the mood for
that.  Bruce Willis, is well, Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich looks really
good on screen.
