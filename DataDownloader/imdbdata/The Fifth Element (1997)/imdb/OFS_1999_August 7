1999_August 7 

&quot;5th&quot; has a very quirky, off-centered, cheesy style to it. If you can't
connect with, or a least understand the tone the movie is trying to
convey,
you will not like this movie. Go rent &quot;Star Wars&quot; if you are into
mainstream. This is the best &quot;bad&quot; movie I have seen since Ghostbusters.
You
can tell this movie will be a cult favorite because this movie is 2 years
old and we are still posting about it! 8 of 10
