          I have seen science fiction all my life, but this is one of this
films where you feel sorry to spend every second watching
it.
          The beginning is good, but after five minutes the rest it's almost
unbearable, the basic story is good but when comes the time to make it grow
up it result in a child's tale. Even when the special effects are good the
acting is very bad, every actor make his work like a clown, maybe the only
one who do some decent work is Bruce Willis. At least to me Eric Serra is
the worst composer I have ever heard (worst than Joel Goldsmith).
                   With a very poor script full of brainless concepts i
really can't understand why many people hate Battlefield Earth, when this
movies have less science fiction and more stupid things than any other film
I ever seen.
