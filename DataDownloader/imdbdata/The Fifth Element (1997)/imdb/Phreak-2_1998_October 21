1998_October 21 

This was the best movie I have ever seen in my life. The first time I saw
it, it was kind of weird, but it had a sort of charm that no other movie has
come close to. After I watched it a couple of times it turned out to have a
good plot, good actors and actresses(except for the president), and great
special effects. I'm giving it a 10 all the way!
