1999_July 25 

This is a very nice entertaining sci-fi movie, nothing more and nothing
less. It has a lot of special effects, action and it's not so serious ( I
think most people were expecting a serious movie I think ). I know the
story
is a bit thin, but it isn't irritating. This movie would appeal to non
sci-fi
fans to. I like the shootout on the cruise/spaceship, it's really over the
top.
