1999_October 31 

I enjoyed The Fifth Element and recommend it.  The DVD of this movie is
stunning both visually and audibly -- I frequently use it to show off my
DVD/large-screen TV system.  The first 2/3 of this movie is good and very
entertaining.  The last 1/3 (aboard the cruise ship) is silly and
boring.
