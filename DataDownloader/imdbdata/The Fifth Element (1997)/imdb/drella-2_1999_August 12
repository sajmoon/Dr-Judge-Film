It's like a film-school attempt to pay tribute to Terry Gilliam. But then
Terry Gilliam's gone pretty cruddy these days as well. [SIGH]. Plus point:
Ian Holm. This criminally underrated actor is unobtrusively brilliant in
whatever he does. Check out Brazil, Madness Of King George, Hour Of The
Pig
etc etc.<br /><br />
