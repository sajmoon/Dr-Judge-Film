2000_April 3 

From the beginning of this film, to the end, I was really sucked into
it. It is full of comedy and action and it never stops entertaining. Bruce
does a very good job in playing his part, just like the rest of the cast.
The way that it all clicks together scene after scene really amazed me. I
give it a big ten.
