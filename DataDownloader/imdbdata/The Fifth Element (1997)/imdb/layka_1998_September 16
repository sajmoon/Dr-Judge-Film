1998_September 16 

When I went to see The Fifth Element at the cinema I went unprepared - I was
blown away! Luc Besson has created a passionate, vivid, mindblowing
experience that uses emotion as one of it's main catalysts. I found the
whole experience..the soundtrack, the characters, the actors, the effects,
excellent, but most of all the simple message of love conquering all
struck through all this adversity and technology. It left me wanting so
badly to be able to be a part of something so great as this film!!   At
least 11 out of 10!!
