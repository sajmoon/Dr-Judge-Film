There is very little that I would change about this movie. It is nearly
perfect. The soundtrack is dead on. The cast is incredible. Bruce is
right at home in this role. Chris Tucker&#39;s funniest movie, easily. Mila
is beautiful and very convincing. Gary Oldman is a great bad guy. The
writing is very entertaining, the dialogue is minimal without being too
pithy. Very little cheese in this one. The special effects are visually
stunning without being distracting. I saw this in the theater three
days after it came out with my wife and a friend and there were only
two other people in the theater. I mention it to people all the time
who have never even heard of it. If you haven&#39;t seen it, don&#39;t bother
renting it - just save yourself the $3 and go buy it. You&#39;ll want to
watch it over and over. And turn up the surround sound, trust me.
