I really enjoyed this movie. Its so much fun that you can watch it all over
again and never get bored. Thats why i own it. Milla Jovovich and Bruce
Willis are great together and they have great chemistry. My favorite part of
this movie is when Plava Laguna sings. I think many who liked this movie
would agree with me. It was a good idea to put Chris Tucker as DJ, because
he's very funny. This movie has it all action, romance, cool costumes, great
effects. Its fun, go rent it. Ratings 10/10
