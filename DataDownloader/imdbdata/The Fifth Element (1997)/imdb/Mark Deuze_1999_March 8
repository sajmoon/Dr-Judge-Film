Luc Besson's Fifth Element is definitely a feast for the eyes and ears.
Whether it has to do with the wonderfully 'sloppy' sci-fi (not so shiningly
perfect as US productions like Star Trek), the tongue-in-cheek humor (Gary
Oldman and Chris Tucker at their best), Jean-Paul Gaultier's hilarious
costumes (the policemen...) or the relaxed acting - every time one sees the
movie new aspects come alive.<br /><br />The basic storyline - good vs. evil where a pretty couple try to save all -
is treated as a given by Besson &amp; Co., while the setting, music and imagery
get all the attention they deserve. The spine-chilling opera/dance sequence
in the middle of the film is just 'one of those' surprises in the movie.<br /><br />Bruce Willis adds another excellent title to his palmares - together with
&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;Twelve Monkeys&quot; - and makes good for his horrible action
flicks. And of course watch out for Milla Jovovich as Leeloo, who has a
memorable pronounciation of the word &quot;multipass'...<br /><br />Besides all of this, there is a quote which should be in the top-10 of movie
history's all-time favorites (like &quot;I'll be back&quot; or &quot;Here's looking at you,
kid&quot;):<br /><br />&quot;Are you German?&quot;<br /><br />
