1999_April 3 

This is the most thrilling Sci-Fi I've ever seen. The couturier Jean-Paul
Gaultier has done a great job: the costumes are really funny or just great.
I suppose that in other Sci-Fi movies everybody shops in the same
'SF-soviet-haute-couture-1$'-store. The plot is actually straight-forward:
bad forces try to conquer/destroy the world, our former-top-military good
guy with gorgeous looking good girl do the rest. Please pay attention to the
computer-animated special effects. This all makes the film very entertaining
and extra-ordinary. Looks good at any film-curriculum.
