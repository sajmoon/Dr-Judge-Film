I can't figure out why this movie has a high rating. I just don't get
how it's possible to say anything positive about this film. The movie
is a really weird mix of science-fiction, action, fantasy, drama and
even comedy. I have no problem in that alone, the problem starts when
it turns out that the movie performs terribly in every genre. Comedy? I
didn't laugh one single time, even though I know the movie tried make
me to. Chris Tucker should be ashamed of himself for his performance in
this one, that's for sure. Fantasy/science-fiction? The movie is a
really weird mixture of the two that only makes it look very bad in
total. One action-scene is halfway interesting, but at that moment in
the film, I was already heavily depressed since I had wasted so much
time for this movie.
