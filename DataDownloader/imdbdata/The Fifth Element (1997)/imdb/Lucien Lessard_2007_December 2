New York City in the far future, A cab driver Korban Dallas (Bruce
Willis) finds himself a passenger that crash landed on his taxi. An
beautiful mysterious woman (Milla Jonovich), who is actually not from
this world. He unwillingly helps her and finds himself fascinated by
her. Father Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm) is actually being waiting for
this unique person. Which she could be the Savior of mankind, since
there&#39;s an dark force of evil is threatened to destroy Earth. Which it
is a dark planet that try to destroy life every five hundred years or
so. This mysterious woman, who calls herself Leeloo is actually the
fifth element. Which she needs four special stones:Wind, Fire, Water,
Earth to make it work to destroy the evil that is coming soon. But they
find themselves chased by aliens and a madman Jean-Baptiste Emanuel
Zorg (Gary Oldmen), who wants these precious stones. Since Zorg is
communicating with the dark force to destroy humanity to spare his
life.<br /><br />Directed by Luc Besson (The Big Blue, The Messenger:The Story of Joan
of Arc, The Professional) made an wildly imaginative film that has
great productions designs, excellent costume designs by Jean-Paul
Gaultier (The City of the Lost Children), superb visual effects and a
game cast. Most of the performances are over the top here, especially
by Oldmen and Chris Tucker as Rudy Rhod. Jonovich is certainly in top
shape in this film and her character is fascinating as well, especially
during the first act. This is probably one of the most expansive movies
to be produced outside of the U.S. The picture&#39;s unusual sense of
humour is the strongest strength of entire film, if not always on
target. Besson&#39;s unique premise is quite sloppy at times, the movie
works well during the first and third act of the movie. This is
certainly worth watching, it is a must see in Widescreen. Plenty of
familiar faces appears in bit roles and amusing cameos. Don&#39;t miss it.
Screenplay by Besson and Robert Mark Kamen (Bandidas, The Karate Kid, A
Walk in the Clouds). From a story by Besson. Super 35. (*** &frac12;/*****).
