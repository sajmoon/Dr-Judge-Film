1999_May 19 

This movie is very boring and childish. You will hate yourself about your
choice, when you finish watching this movie. There is no action, no
philosophy, only ugly special effects. Chris Tucker's comedy is never
funny.
Bruce sometimes chose good movies, but shouldn't have filmed this
movie.
