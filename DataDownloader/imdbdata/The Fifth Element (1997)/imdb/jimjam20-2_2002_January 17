Although I still like this movie, since I saw it my senior year with my
buddies, it just dosen't hold up today. Bruce Willis plays his typical
every-man out to save the world. Gary Oldman is sort of a joke with his over
the top southern accent. Chris Tucker is just annoying in what ever he is
in.  A few highlights mixed into the clutter, but over all...is just a
mindless sci-fi-comedy-action flick. If you like those sort of movies, you
will prolly love this.
