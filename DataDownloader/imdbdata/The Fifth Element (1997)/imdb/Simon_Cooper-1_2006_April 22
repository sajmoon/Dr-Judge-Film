Fifth Element is an enormous film even to watch. The scale of vision
with which it has been written, directed and produced has quite
literally got to be seen to be believed. Besson&#39;s skill at picking the
actors and dressing them up in a certain way to change the impact of
their role is probably second to none and so many sequences in this
movie are real ground breaking artistic and conceptual amalgamations
that work on many levels. Comedy, passion and intelligence are rife in
this film at every step, with the chemistry of leeloo and korbin as
well as cornelius, rhuby and zorg with some wonderfully edited scenes
to throw them all together. Watch out for schematic and visual ideas
that went on to be a big part of &#39;the matrix&#39; films.
