this was an unbelievable movie with a good story and is easy to follow.
Milla Jovovich is absolutely beautiful but Chris Tucker&#x27;s character is
probably the most annoying character in any film ever created. His
massively annoying voice is topped off by his extreme stupidity and he
almost made me want to turn the movie off. luckily the movie was very
well written and all the other actors and actresses did a very good
job. would be in my top 5 if it weren&#x27;t for Ruby Rhod. i still give it
8 stars out of 10 though. Chris Tucker knocked two of them off
unfortunately. He was not funny at all. Bruce Willis exhibited his
great acting skills as he always does and Luc Besson is one of my
favorite and he never ceases to amaze me. Gary Oldman was brilliant and
continues to amaze me with his diverse acting skills, from Commissioner
Gordan all the way to Drexl Spivey. There is some good comic relief to
the awesome story line in the amazing action movie.
