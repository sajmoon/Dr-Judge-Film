Two hundred and fifty years in the future, life as we know it is
threatened by the arrival of Evil. Only the fifth element can stop the
Evil from extinguishing life, as it tries to do every five thousand
years. She is helped by ex-soldier, current-cab-driver, Korben Dallas,
who is, in turn, helped by Prince/Arsenio clone, Ruby Rhod.
Unfortunately, Evil is being assisted by Mr. Zorg, who seeks to profit
from the chaos that Evil will bring, and his alien mercenaries.<br /><br />There is one flaw in this film. It&#39;s kinda long with its slow start.
Apart from that, after thirty minutes, it a smooth ride from there.
This is what you would want in a popcorn movie. You have the great
action sequences with the great special effects and you also have the
lovable characters!<br /><br />Visually, the movie is amazing! The set designs are fantastic and the
costumes and effects are great! I just loved this movie because not
only it was entertaining at best, it was also very funny with it&#39;s
clever comedic scenes.<br /><br />The acting by Bruce Willis was mediocre. I never thought of him as a
great actor anyway. Gary Oldman&#39;s, Ian Holm&#39;s, and Chris Tucker&#39;s
performance were funny and probably the best was Milla Jovovich. She
learned an entire different language (made up by the director, Luc
Besson) and spoke it so clearly in the movie!<br /><br />If you just want a very entertaining popcorn film with very funny
scenes and great action sequences with breath taking effects, this is
the perfect movie! It&#39;s just refreshing to see a movie that don&#39;t take
itself too seriously to make it that good!
