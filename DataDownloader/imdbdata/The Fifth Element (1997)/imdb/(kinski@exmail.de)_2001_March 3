Certainly, The Fifth Element is one of the best science-fiction-films, I
have ever seen. It&acute;s not only based on spaceship-wars or anything like
that,
the amazing thing of this film is, that it&acute;s really crazy: The costumes of
this film, designed by Jean Gaultier, are excellent and no one of other
genre-hits is able to top them. Finally, I want to say, that it&acute;s a
firework
of mad (positive) ideas, and because of these facts you can excuse some
weaknesses of the plot
