2002_May 28 

For years, I have been trying to maintain that differences in taste have
nothing to do with gender and everything to do with personality, and I
think
the comments on &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; have proven me wrong.  When I watched
this movie (with my Bruce Willis obsessed finance), I had to turn it off
it
was so bad.  And I even (generally) like sci-fi!  The only plot element
was
saving the skimpily clad woman who wandered about making **cute** faces
while the camera hovered over her body like
an annoying mosquito.  Wasn't anything else going to happen?  When
I
finally saw this movie again, I realized that she and Bruce were destined
to
get together and fight some bad guys along the way.  The majority of the
film, however, is still dedicated to worship of the female body and
violence
against the female body.  The near cult worship of this film baffles and
frightens me.  Really, is there some
alternate version I missed, because I am convinced I did not see the same
film the rest of you have~
