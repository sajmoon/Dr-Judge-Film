I have loved this film ever since I first saw it in theaters about four
years ago. It is exciting and funny, with several great performances. I
particularly liked Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich. Chris Tucker's
character
was unbelievably funny, and for those people who were annoyed by how loud
and whiny he was, well, that's why so many people thought he was funny. He
was such an obvious parody of Prince(wussy, worshiped by ladies) that
viewers couldn't help cracking up. The special effects were great, and I
can't believe it didn't get an Oscar for the visual effects. I loved the
exciting flying-car chase. However, my favorite part of the film would
have
to be the awesome fight scene between Leeloo and the ugly Mangalore
aliens.
This was filmed perfectly, and is one of the best movie fight scenes
ever!Still, the rest of the movie is also really good, and I highly
recommend it to anyone who enjoys action or sci-fi.
