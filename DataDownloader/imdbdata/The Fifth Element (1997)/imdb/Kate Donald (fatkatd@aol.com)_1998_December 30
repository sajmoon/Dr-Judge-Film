Jesus, what a film.  OK, so it may not be profound or deep, but who gives?
This is a great, jaw-dropping, eye-popping film that I have seen many times,
and it never ceases to impress me.  Everyone slags off Bruce Willis, and,
granted, he's made a few bad movies (Mercury Rising anyone?), but given the
right film Bruce is always a tour de force (Die Hard, Pulp Fiction).  And
boy, is this the right film.  The effects are incredible, the acting superb
(Milla Jovovich is a most promising newcomer), the direction flawless.  But
its the whole enormity of the vision that gets me, a vision of the future
Luc Besson (who surely is God himself) dreamed up when he was 15.  He has
now realised this vision, and brilliantly so.  The Fifth Element is very
different to Besson's last film masterpiece, Leon, but almost as good in its
own weird, futuristic way. This film, for me, has everything; comedy,
action, romance, drama and edge-of-the-seat moments aplenty.  I know it's
not everyone's cup of tea, I know a few people who hated it passionately,
but its in my all time top 10 with Star Wars, Leon, The Princess Bride and
The Shawshank Redemption, among others.  If you're looking for pure
entertainment, check out the Fifth Element - if you're anything like me it
won't disappoint.
