1999_March 11 

Milla does a great job as the sweet, unexperienced Leeloo, and Bruce (as
most of the time) runs his own race as the disillusioned and only &quot;normal&quot;
person in the world, someone to identify yourself with in a scenario as
bizarre as this. I can understand why some people dislike the
&quot;how-future-will-become-vision&quot; of The Fifth Element, when seeing it as
non-realistic sci-fi, but i think the creators parodic touch in this movie is
excellent; the exaggeration of the city itself, zorgs management, ruby, the
paradise planet, etc.
I gave it 10/10, its like sweets for both my heart and soul in the average
gray weekday.
