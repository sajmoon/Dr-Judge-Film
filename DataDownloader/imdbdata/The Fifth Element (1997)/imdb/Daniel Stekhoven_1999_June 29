1999_June 29 

When I first saw TFE I was blended by the pictures, the colors and the
sounds. Sooner I recognized, that there is more than just the hype-sci-fi
action movie. I'm not sure if the majority of viewers have really got the
message of the movie. It's one of the best, for me THE BEST, movies ever.
Especially the beautiful and talented Milla Jovovich and the great Bruce
Willis give it a note of action, sci-fi, story line and superb humor. It
deserves a 10!
