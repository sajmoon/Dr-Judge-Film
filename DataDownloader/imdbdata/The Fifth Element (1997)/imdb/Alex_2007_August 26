The Fifth Element, is a beautiful movie produced by the French director
Luc Besson, featuring Milla Jovovich (Leeloo) and Bruce Willis (Korban
Dallas). This film is possibly my most favoured, incorporating strange
musical melodies such as tech-no;opera combined and an unusual,
colourful atmosphere. Endevoured with unusual creatures and characters
such as Zorg, his minions and plavalaguna ,they don&#39;t follow
traditional appearances of aliens and personalities making it
different. This film was considered to have the highest budget of its
time in 1997, with 80 million spent, and more than 250 million earned.
I&#39;m not a particular fan of Sci-Fi movies, but this is one of a kind
and my favourite and will remain so to me. If you crave suspense,
action, love, comedy, fantasy and modern musical touches, then you&#39;ll
love this movie. A magical fantasy set in the future with a beautiful
story.
