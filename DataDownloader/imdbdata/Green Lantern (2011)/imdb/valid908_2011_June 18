This for comic book fans is just atrocious. Flat storyline with just
hyped up special effects and a loud sound base to cover up the fact
that this is just a bad movie. Nothing memorable in this or original
and the actors are just not up to par. Why they got Blake Lively for
this movie is beyond me. She&#x27;s a terrible actress and can&#x27;t hold a
picture like this. I think she should go for lifetime movies or
something like that - that would better hold her um...&#x22;talent&#x22;.
Probably has this role because of her PR (joke) and that her mom is a
manager but REALLY they should have gotten someone that could have
least act!<br /><br />Overall, just a waste of time, money and theater space. Not a movie
even really to wait for on netflix, on demand or whatever that you use.
I would say just pass on this in general and you&#x27;ll be glad you didn&#x27;t
waste your couple of hours watching this turkey!
