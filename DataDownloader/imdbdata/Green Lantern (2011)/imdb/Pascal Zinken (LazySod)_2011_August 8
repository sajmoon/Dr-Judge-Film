The Universe is a big and dangerous place. Good thing there&#x27;s an agency
of guardians to watch over us. When one of them dies their selection
procedure finds a replacement, and against all odds it turns out to be
an Earthling.<br /><br />Another comic turned into film. Another comic I have never read so I
can&#x27;t say whether the conversion was done well or not. As a film it
works OK enough - it&#x27;s popcorn amusement with plenty of spectacle to
keep the audience busy for its full duration. It is not going to win
any prices though, no master piece performances, no master piece story,
no master piece of anything.<br /><br />Graphic-wise it works well enough. The planet of the guardians is
depicted like a place worth living and the effects used are ranging
from OK enough to pretty good. Story-wise it tells enough even though
most of the backing tale is biased along an all-too-known clich&#xE9;.
Sound-wise I see no reason to complain - music was either not there or
not disturbing.<br /><br />So, all in all, a 7 out of 10. Popcorn amusement and decent enough at
that.
