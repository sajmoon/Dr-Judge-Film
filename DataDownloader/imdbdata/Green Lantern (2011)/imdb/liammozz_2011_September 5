Movie: The Green Lantern Realise Date: 17 June 2011 (UK)<br /><br />When I found out there was gong to be a film made based on the green
lantern, I was filled with excitement. I have always enjoyed watching
comic book to film remakes from Spider-man to Batman it didn&#x27;t matter
if it was made by DC comics or Marvel and this one did not disappoint.
The story line was excellent apart from a few changes they made to the
original story, which I have never been a fan of. It had everything you
would expect from a comic books story line:- love, betrayal, inner-
conflict and the all important climatic battle.<br /><br />PLOT Hal Jordan is a test pilot for a company who are trying to get a
contract from the U.S army, but as he is showing off to prove a point
he has flashbacks and chokes causing him to crash his plane. While
getting drunk and wallowing in his own self pity an alien mortally
wounded by a being called Parallax, crashes on earth bestows the power
of the green lantern core. After being flung across the galaxy to the
planet Oa, he declines the invitation to join the core saying the ring
had made a mistake choosing him.<br /><br />Ryan Reyolds played the part of the green lantern outstandingly he was
how a superhero should be, strong but with a weakness he uses to his
advantage to overcome unbeatable odds. Mark Strong also played a
brilliant performance as Sinestro and looks like he will be the villain
for the sequel.<br /><br />The only down point of the film was the quality of the CGI. With
today&#x27;s advances in CGI they could have done a lot better making Abin
Sur and the Guardians blend in to their surroundings, rather than them
sticking out like a sore thumb.
