23 cents at RedBox was outrageous for this atrocity. That was the most
horrible movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />If Ryan Renolds ever reads this... Brother, I feel sorry for you. I
know that this bastard child movie of the Comic Book remakes of
Hollywood is not of your production or design, and I personally will
not hold you accountable. If National Lampoon decides to follow up Van
Wilder with 6 remakes, I will follow you through all of them, as that
there is no way that even the worst possible of those movies can hold a
candle to how stupid Green Lantern was. We love you, and please bounce
back!!!!!!!
