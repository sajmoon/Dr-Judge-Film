&#x22;The Green Lantern&#x22; is one of those movies some people will love while
others really want to love, but can&#x27;t because of its numerous flaws
starting with its script. The script is not a horrible comic book
adaptation; it was just undertaken in a lazy and cheesy way. Even so,
Martin Campbell (&#x22;Casino Royale&#x22;) has directed an average action movie
with a lot of spectacle and no substance. Ryan Reynolds (&#x22;Buried&#x22;)
stars as a hotheaded pilot named Hal Jordan destined to be a part of a
universal peacekeeping brother hood known as the Green Lantern Corps.
The power of the Green Lanterns comes from the power of will wielded by
the use of a ring and a special green lantern they each receive. This
allows them to produce anything that they see in their minds as long as
they are strong willed and fearless. However, after years of peace a
new evil plagues their ranks called Parallax whose power comes from
fear. Parallax has begun to kill Green Lanterns causing a big weight to
rest on Hal Jordan after he is chosen to be the first human Green
Lantern by dying alien. In order to succeed, Hal must learn from his
past with the help of his love interest Carol Ferris (Blake Lively,
&#x22;The Town&#x22;) and the Green Lantern Corps&#x27; Sinestro (Mark Strong, &#x22;Kick
Ass&#x22;) and Kilowog (Michael Clark Duncan, &#x22;The Green Mile&#x22;) to harness
the power of Green Lantern&#x27;s might to defeat this new evil that has
taken hold of Dr. Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard, &#x22;An Education&#x22;) on
earth itself.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds was correctly casted as Hal because of his charismatic
acting ability. However, he would have been off if he had a script to
support him that didn&#x27;t make a mockery of his character. Consequently,
the best parts of the film occur when he uses his unique abilities
conjuring colorful visuals consisting of various manipulations of green
light. This makes his alter ego the Green Lantern a more fulfilling
character than Hal, especially when he is in the realms outside of
earth.<br /><br />Peter Sarsgaard struggles in this film with a script cueing him to
scream every five minutes and poor character development making him one
of the worst villains to ever be in a superhero movie. Also, the fast
pace and weak transitions between earth and the realms of space makes
this film seem as if it is made up of two separate movies forced
together into one jumbled mess. Another indicator of this can be seen
with the indecisiveness of the scriptwriters mixing comedic jeering
with dramatic action sequences in awkward fashion.<br /><br />&#x22;The Green Lantern&#x22; doesn&#x27;t bring anything new to its genre and feels
like a recycled superhero film covered in green. However, Ryan
Reynolds&#x27;s charm and the visuals of the film&#x27;s action sequences makes
the film a watchable summer flick.
