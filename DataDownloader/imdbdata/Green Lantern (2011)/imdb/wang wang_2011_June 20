Green Lantern is little more than a badly written Tinkerbell movie--a
story about a Chosen One who succeeds, finally, because he believes in
himself and uses his &#x22;green energy of will&#x22; to defeat a cloud of feces
using its &#x22;yellow energy of fear.&#x22; Unfortunately, the audience never
can believe in this character. What sinks the picture is that it lacks
all sense of wonder and never emotionally connects with us. A pure
video game movie if their ever was one but it&#x27;s a video game without
the fun. Even some movies adapted from video games themselves have more
depth than this effort. Seriously.<br /><br />This movie is yet another victim of the spend more and think less way
to make movies. It can join The Clash of the Titans franchise at the
bottom of the all CGI intellectual think tank. You couldn&#x27;t pay me
enough to see it twice. I have to ask, who does this appeal to? With
more CG scenery than sanity, not even a hundred guardians, aliens or
lanterns give the audience the nourishment that comes from a credible
story, or at least a story that&#x27;s believable on its own terms. It&#x27;s a
big jumbled ball of Computer Generated boredom. This movie has to be
considered one huge misfire. It will be forgotten by August. It&#x27;s
actually fitting for a movie with a poor plot and an incredibly shallow
story.<br /><br />The dialogue is stiffly Shatnerian. Word of mouth will savage it.
That&#x27;s the word of non-fanboys and comic book lovers who would praise
this thing no matter what. If you can manage not to fall asleep during
it&#x27;s brief but surprisingly dull runningtime, the movie itself reaches
the level of below turgid mediocrity that DC&#x27;s last effort, Jonah Hex
reached. About the only thing one can be thankful for is that Jar Jar
Binks isn&#x27;t one of these crazy alien Lanterns. A sad endeavor to say
the least so, Don&#x27;t waste your money here.
