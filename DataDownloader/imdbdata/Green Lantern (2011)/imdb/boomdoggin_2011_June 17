Five or ten years ago, you could get away with really screwing up on
your movie adaptation of a classic comic book superhero. When Richard
Pryor - Richard freaking Pryor, the comedian - headlined Superman 3, or
when Joel Schumacher raped Batman with a disco ball and made Bane wear
a Hulk suit, we could forgive those things because they were stomping
on new ground anyway. Nobody had ever done a successful third episode
to a superhero movie franchise. But ever since square one - Marlon
Brando and those sweet, sweet Mario Puzo scripts that started it all
with Superman 1 and 2 - we&#x27;ve known how to pull off at least a good
&#x27;start&#x27; to a superhero franchise.<br /><br />Not to mention the rabble of others since that have attacked us on all
sides, and managed to get things right: Spider man (goofy but good),
X-Men (hasty but solid), Batman Begins (dark and believable), Iron Man
(charmingly ironic), and even the Burton Batman, which was a little too
much purple, and not enough black, but still rocked pretty hard.
There&#x27;s also a whole s%&#x26;#storm of other ones that didn&#x27;t work, but at
least showed us what NOT to do in the future: Ang Lee&#x27;s Hulk (too
avante garde, and Gumby as the Hulk), Fantastic Four (Doctor Doom, the
single heaviest supervillain of all time, played by some poser
fruitcake from Nip Tuck), Jonah Hex (why?) and Catwoman (Sharon Stone
was a plastic-surgery-themed villain in that one). So there was ample
opportunity to learn from the past, pick what worked and not doom the
Green Lantern movie franchise from the start, but apparently that
opportunity wasn&#x27;t ample enough.<br /><br />So then why did this suck so much? I&#x27;ll start with the obvious: NO
movie is going to be good just from having CGI - even a lot of CGI - in
it. CGI hasn&#x27;t really been mind-blowing since Jurassic Park, and hasn&#x27;t
even necessarily been a good thing since Star Wars: Special Edition.
Correlary: if your CGI doesn&#x27;t look as good as the CGI in either of
those films, it&#x27;s not even going to be very impressive. I know Green
Lantern&#x27;s kinda predicated on computer generated animation, and to be
fair I&#x27;d say some of what I saw in this film was pretty neat-lookin&#x27;,
but banking on people being too distracted by shiny rings and race cars
to notice all the other crap I&#x27;m about to rail on that made this film
awful - that&#x27;s just bad business.<br /><br />There was a good actor in this movie. Mark Strong did Sinestro about as
well as I&#x27;d imagine anyone can (we&#x27;re not talking Shakespeare here,
right?). Everyone else blew chunks. Actually that&#x27;s not true; there
were a few seconds of the film where I liked Tomar-Re (the fish lookin&#x27;
lantern); whoever did his voice in the sound studio gets a gold star.
Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan? I doubt it. He&#x27;s dead-on as Deadpool - you
know, for the minute of dialogue they squeezed in for him in Wolverine
- but he&#x27;s not really DC icon material. The DC superhero universe only
even plausibly stands up to its Marvel counterparts because its nucleic
pantheon of 6-10 heavy-hitting, iconic characters (Superman, Batman,
Wonder Woman, GL, Flash...) are officially MORE super than almost any
Marvel character comparable to them (Superman&#x27;s more iconic than Cap.
America; Batman&#x27;s more iconic than Wolverine, etc.). When you make a
Green Lantern movie, you have to put a guy in that suit that commands
respect, not the dude who played Van Wilder in Van Wilder.<br /><br />There were a few points in the film where the people around me cracked
up, presumably when they weren&#x27;t supposed to, like when Hector Hammond
screams like a girl, or when Reynolds tried to do the Bale Batman thing
and talk in a deep voice to his throwaway female lead in that throwaway
identity reveal scene in the middle of the movie. Note to the creative
team: Try screening your movie before you put it out as it is; you
might learn how terrible it is before word gets out and a humiliating
screen writing credit follows you around for the rest of your career.
This one will.<br /><br />They put a bunch of easter-egg cameos of other DC comic book characters
in here, some of them not directly related to the Green Lantern story.
God I hope that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re trying to seed this as the first
in a line of badly-written, awkwardly paced bastardizations of what
could have otherwise been good superhero films that eventually lead up
to a monumentally bastardized Justice League movie - like what Marvel&#x27;s
doing with the Avengers- but where Batman wears gray tights, Jason
Biggs plays the Flash and Aquaman rides a big sea horse. Somehow I
imagine that was the intent though; don&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t warn you.<br /><br />So in short: your 6 to 10-year old might like it, but if you do, you
have the good taste of a 6 to 10-year old.<br /><br />Enjoy!
