Hal Jordan&#x97;attempting to follow in the footsteps of his late father&#x97;is
a hotshot test pilot who&#x27;s never realized his full potential. His
opportunity to do just that comes sooner than expected when he&#x27;s chosen
to inherit a mystical green ring that not only grants him outwardly
abilities, but more importantly forces him to join a group of fearless
intergalactic warriors whose mission is to fight evil and keep peace in
the universe, but does Jordan really possess the will it takes to
succeed? Comic book adaptation has a plethora of splendid visual
effects, some effective moments of human drama, and Reynolds is
effective in the lead, but the story isn&#x27;t very compelling and unfolds
in disappointingly routine fashion. **&#xBD;
