Out of all the super hero&#x27;s the Green Lantern&#x27;s story is probably the
most basic. <br /><br />The problem I had with the movie was that even though the story isn&#x27;t
exactly brain surgery, the acting was over the top bad and uninspired.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds acts like he&#x27;s having beers with his buddies on a
weekend, and that this Green Lantern thing happens to him every week. <br /><br />Blake Lively has never been a great actress but she sleep walks through
this. I think she changed expressions twice during the entire movie.
I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;s a nice person but I really don&#x27;t get her. I don&#x27;t think
any Oscar nominations are in order. <br /><br />The rest of the cast isn&#x27;t bad with Tim Robbins and Angela Bassett
giving their usual good performances, but it&#x27;s hard to get excited
about it. <br /><br />If you have 2 hours to waste; and I mean waste; then you can see this.
If you don&#x27;t then wait for the video. This is one movie that I hope a
sequel isn&#x27;t in the works.
