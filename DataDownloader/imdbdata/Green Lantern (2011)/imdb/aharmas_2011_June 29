2011_June 29 
Well, I liked the cast. Lively, Reynolds, Strong (unrecognizable), and
Saargard were trying hard with what they were given, and I wonder what
went through Robbins&#x27; mind when he read the &#x22;script&#x22;, which might have
been as agonizing to read as it is sitting through some of most
terrible lines ever in a DC comic based action film. At times I felt
like I was sitting in a very unimaginative school production of a
famous play. There were moments that fell between laughable and
excruciating. The cast had good chemistry, and the special effects were
better than average, but those dreary lines.<br /><br />The previews were varied, with some truly hinting at the mess the movie
could have been, and there were moments were I thought we were going to
be treated to an action / fantasy filled extravaganza. &#x22;Thor&#x22; proved to
be a lot of fun, &#x22;X-Men&#x22; delivered so far, and even down-to-Earth crash
feasts like &#x22;Fast Five&#x22; have given us plenty be excited about at the
movies.<br /><br />In &#x22;Lantern&#x22; the disembodied villain never quite provokes any sort of
reaction in the audience, as we can&#x27;t figure what his motivation is. We
can&#x27;t quite understand what IT is, but we have to assume it is angry
and dangerous, and the mutant creation on Earth delivers a couple of
lines that are supposed to satisfy our curiosity about his dislike of
the main character. Sloppy attention of details works like a cancer
through this film, and takes away from whatever attempts Reynolds, who
is goofy and likable, gives the movie. It was fun to see Lively, having
some fun in the screen, though she doesn&#x27;t quite reach the confidence
Paltrow and Johanson have achieved in similar roles (&#x22;Ironman&#x22; I and
II). Angela Basset looked well a bit uncomfortable playing a role that
should have suited her very well.<br /><br />I must admit green is not my favourite color, and it tends be
associated with malignancy and evil, but the film does tell you that
emerald green is the essence of the will, thus we have to go along with
the premise, but there is something about the color scheme of the movie
that keeps her from being more beautiful and entrancing. My mind kept
wandering back to jewels like &#x22;The Dark Knight&#x22; where nothing looks
relatively spectacular, but somehow it feels dynamic, foreboding,
exciting, full of emotions we are supposed to have in this type of
film. Last year &#x22;Inception&#x22; gave plenty to enjoy visually. Here there
is plenty of damage to the entire canvas, and the enjoyment is sort of
muted. If the film spawns a franchise, and we have more returns from
the same cast, let&#x27;s hope that just like the Hulk, it finds its rhythm,
its heart, and we&#x27;re treated to a true spectacle, to a fun time, and to
an episode where we really care and want to cheer the hero as he fights
a worthy opponent.<br /><br />Maybe I&#x27;m expecting too much, but I yearn for the visuals of that man
flying faster than a speeding bullet, or the ominous notes and visuals
of the psychologically scarred knight. It feels like this character
deserved much better, whatever its original goal might have been. Yes,
it failed, but at least it looks pretty.
