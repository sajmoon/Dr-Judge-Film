Green Lantern - Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) receives a ring from a
mysterious dying alien and finds that through it his thought can be
turned into reality. He uses the ring to fight a fear-based enemy
Parralax, which is not a pharmaceutical drug but an intergalactic glob
of space doom.<br /><br />You know, for a story of such intergalactic peril, it&#x27;s hard for me to
remember anything of significance. The movie is literally slipping from
my mind, but I&#x27;ll do my best to diagnose the film.<br /><br />The Good: The Green Lantern planet of Oa, and the power ring effects
are pretty. The performances aren&#x27;t bad. Ryan Reynolds is a good actor,
even though he wouldn&#x27;t have been my choice for Hall Jordan. Peter
Saarsgard is also good as Hector Hammond, and the film would have
benefited from more of him. Whenever Mark Strong appears, I feel like
caring. There&#x27;s a training sequence that is easily the most
entertaining thing in this film. Mark Strong just has a gravitas and an
intensity that the movie needed more of. That&#x27;s not to say that the
rest of the film is full of laughs. It&#x27;s not. Humor would have also
added a lot to the film.<br /><br />The Bad: About that lack of humor. I&#x27;m going to blame most of the
faults in this film on the writers. Nearly all of them have only
written for television. They&#x27;ve all produced more than written, and two
of them have written for No Ordinary Family and the bad half of Heroes.
Oy. To quote the Mythbusters in a pseudo-plumber voice: &#x22;Well there&#x27;s
your problem.&#x22; There are a bunch of superfluous scenes and some fairly
random cuts to unrelated stories scattered through the film. Nearly
everyone mentions Hal&#x27;s dad&#x27;s jet fighter fatality to him at least
once, just to make sure we remember. Then there&#x27;s the problem that the
audience is supposed to believe two test pilots, a senator, and biology
scientist all know each other stretching back to childhood or are
related. And two of them receive superpowers. It&#x27;s not like this is
going to ruin the film. It&#x27;s just another thing that subtly tells you
someone wasn&#x27;t trying. And that&#x27;s the gist I get from this film.<br /><br />The film basically has no real antagonist. There&#x27;s a floating cloud of
blackish-yellow Parralax doom, but it never really poses a threat. It&#x27;s
kind of laughable that Hal Jordan travels to Oa and back to Earth twice
before Parralax could conceivably reach either. Thank goodness when it
gets to Earth it attacks the half of that planet that&#x27;s in broad
daylight, or you&#x27;d never find it. Hector Hammond should be a better
nemesis, as he has telekinesis and telepathy and an actual personality,
but the film spends too much time trying to make him sympathetic rather
than a true villain. He has no real scheme or goals, he&#x27;s just a victim
of Parralax. I know the reason the filmmakers went with these two sad
sacks is they want to save Sinestro for a sequel, but judging from the
box-office returns (only $50 million on the opening weekend? for
shame.) they should have hedged their bets and spent that rainy day
money early.<br /><br />Because there&#x27;s no real villain, the problem Hal faces is...self doubt.
How exciting. He has substantial fears, which is exactly the sort of
thing I would think should probably disqualify someone from being a
test pilot. Anywho, I think Hal&#x27;s real problem is a lack of
imagination. A minigun, chainsaw, and a couple of jet fighters are the
most interesting things Hal does with the ring.<br /><br />The Ugly: The film has a drastic overuse of CGI. Green Lantern should
at LEAST have a real honest to goodness costume. Superman&#x27;s from
another planet too, but his costume is made of honest to goodness
cloth. It&#x27;s hard to really be interested in a hero when 85% of his body
is digital. And when his power is to create green CGI from the power of
will, there should be more creative uses than what we see. What should
be Hal&#x27;s iconic entrance into the public eye has him instead - I kid
you not - rollar skating a helicopter through a series of Matchbox
Car-style loops to safety. Like a Cartoon. I think Daredevil slicing a
man in half with a subway train was a better superhero introduction.
Even the characters later admit how stupid and un-iconic an
introduction Green Lantern&#x27;s display of power was, which means the
writers probably also knew.<br /><br />Bottom line, the movie is ho hum. There&#x27;s just no wow factor. Aliens
and power rings and telepathy seem to faze almost nobody in this film.
And if they&#x27;re not interested, I&#x27;m not interested. There are few
moments of power, depth, or interest or anything. Therefore, I give the
film a D+
