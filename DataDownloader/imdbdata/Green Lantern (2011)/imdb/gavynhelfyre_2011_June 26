Back in 1977 when George Lucas told a story in the frame of Joseph
Campbells Heroes Journey, it was unique. When Sam Raimi told a super
hero story with the same structure in 2002, there was still plenty it
added a new filter. And, when Jon Favreau did it again in 2008, he
added enough unique touches to the tale to reinvigorate what was
becoming a tired formula.<br /><br />The writers of Green Lantern felt it was enough to skim cliffnotes of
Campbell and write the film based on their notes of the reading and
half remembered recollections of reading comic books when they were 12.
There is nothing new in this film. A man is given a magic ring which
takes him out of the world of the ordinary and makes him a hero. We
don&#x27;t grow to care about him because he doesn&#x27;t grow or change... he
simply goes through the motions because the script tells him to.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds tries his best with a weak and contrived script, but he
still comes off too snarky to be the overconfident jet pilot he&#x27;s
supposed to be. It&#x27;s not all his fault, as the script is much more
content to tell us what the cast is feeling or thinking instead of
letting the actors convey it through their actions, inflections or
looks. It is as if the writers had no faith in their cast or direction,
let alone their audience, and dumbed the entire affair down below even
the cartoon portrayals of the character.<br /><br />The visuals are nice, but never have weight, leading to the effect that
Ryan Reynolds head if occasionally floating through a video game. It&#x27;s
sad to think it&#x27;s been six years since Gollum, and this is the best
Warner Brothers can offer us in a tent pole film. It&#x27;s also a shame to
think this is the best they could do with only 37 million dollars less
than Avatar. Again, it just shows that the production staff was lazy,
never pushing it to look better, and instead setting for the &#x22;they&#x27;ll
think it looks cool&#x22; effect.<br /><br />We should demand better from comic book films. After having Dark Knight
and Iron Man in a single year, we should not be subjected to subpar
outings like this. Fun is one thing, mind numbingly dumb and lazy is
another.<br /><br />Skip this in the theater. Wait for it to come to NetFlix and then
forget to put it in your cue. You&#x27;ll thank me.
