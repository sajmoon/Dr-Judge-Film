After its absolutely atrocious trailer debut late last year, I had very
little faith in Green Lantern. It had been well over forty years since
the debut Superman: The Movie on the big screen, and years and years of
Marvel hero debuts, sequels, reboots and on-going franchises &#x96; surely
the goofiness and complete ineptitude of this trailer was not the most
obvious of suggestions as to why Warner had never gone back to the DC
well outside of Batman, Superman and their cooky band of misunderstood
villains. The second trailer was a significant improvement, but did
very little to alleviate my initial thoughts of how terrible the film
looked.<br /><br />Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) is a cocky fighter pilot who tends to test
the limits of just about everyone. He is &#x22;chosen&#x22; by the ring of fallen
alien Abin Sur (Temuera Morrison), to become the next in a line of
universe-wide heroes called the Green Lantern Corps. Hal is obviously
reluctant to join, but as evil starts to descend on Earth, he must
quickly decide whether or not he will become the hero he was chosen to
be.<br /><br />Earlier this summer, I sat and was almost completely underwhelmed by
Thor. It had infinite potential (including an amazing choice for a
lead), but it felt like all we got were a couple of awesome scenes on
Thor&#x27;s home planet of Asgard, a nearly unwatchable 3D post conversion,
more of a push toward The Avengers and a whole lot of Earthbound
melodrama. Green Lantern fares a little better in the 3D department,
but practically mimics every single one of Thor&#x27;s problems. It saddens
me to say, but some of those problems are even worse. <br /><br />Green Lantern is an origin story, but one that feels disgustingly
incomplete. The film spends its majority paralleling Hal&#x27;s ascent to
becoming a Green Lantern, and scientist Hector Hammond&#x27;s (Peter
Sarsgaard) descent into villainy. While this was an interesting way for
the film to truck along, I felt cheated because it never really takes
the time to tell us who either of these characters really is. There is
no rich storytelling here, just actions and reactions. They even throw
in a few backstories with hints and elements that never come to
fruition (including a rather important one about a deadly accident
involving Hal&#x27;s father). Most do not even have a reason to exist in the
first place. It seems like they left it all out so they had something
to fill the holes in the eventual sequel. It makes for a lot of boring
exposition, and very little excitement outside of the action sequences.<br /><br />While the badly cobbled together storyline is an issue that looms over
the film like the plague, it seems like the acting is just as much at
fault as well. He may have charisma and a well sculpted body, but
Reynolds is totally wrong as Hal. He brings his usual wise-ass routine
that has worked well for the better part of a decade, but it only works
for the first half of the film. The moment he gets the ring, it almost
instantaneously stops working. He ends up spending the entirety of the
second half looking like he wandered onto the set of another film. He
looks physically unable to rectify and align the comedy with the drama,
and ends up going through the motions and phoning in the performance.
Same goes for Blake Lively, who plays love interest Carol Ferris. After
seeing her nearly unrecognizable turn in The Town, I expected a
performance that was a little more than just a damsel in distress.
Sadly, outside of a bit of yelling, that was all I got &#x96; and a pretty
awful one at that. The less said about their &#x22;chemistry&#x22;, the better.<br /><br />While Mark Strong is just as reliable as he always will be (even with
less screen time than I imagined), the other standout is Sarsgaard. He
seems just as badly miscast as Reynolds and Lively, but attempts to
salvage what he is given as much as he possible can. Yes, he spends one
scene just looking at the camera with a sad, shifty look in his eyes,
and spends countless others just uttering bizarre screams. When he is
not doing either of those, he spends his time chewing scenery left and
right. He is clearly the best actor among those with a lot of time on
screen, and he makes it clear that he deserves to be in something
better. <br /><br />The only thing that saves Green Lantern from total oblivion is the
awesome effects it employs from beginning to end. A lot of effort went
into making them great and just as fantastical as the comics have
dictated for so many years. Shots on Oa are amazing, and the creatures
that inhabit it are just as good if not better. Even seeing Reynolds
interacting with the likes of Tomar-Re or Kilowog (voiced impeccably by
Geoffrey Rush and Michael Clarke Duncan) only proved greater as the
scenes moved along. The creativity and detail in the many different
items Hal possesses on the fly are all visually stunning. And somehow,
despite my early concerns of how silly his suit looked, the designers
did an excellent job of making it just as realistic as physically
possible (and even made the mask look half decent). <br /><br />I really hoped my initial trailer analysis for Green Lantern was
horribly wrong, but am incredibly disappointed that I was right on the
money. The movie is a letdown even with the lowest of expectations, and
only has very few reasons to shine. But with everything that goes wrong
in the film, it just feels like it was destined for failure from the
start. And with that in mind, what was the point of even bothering in
the first place? <br /><br />5/10.<br /><br />(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).
