Not sure what film the critics where watching did they accidentally
post reviews for Green Hornet by mistake. This was brilliant and it did
what all great comic book movies should do it made me want to go buy
the comics. My only negative feelings about the movie is that it did
plod in places but over all definitely a 8 out of 10. I had to look
into Parallax as I&#x27;d heard a different origin story but it seems there
are a few different versions around. As I&#x27;m not a massive expert on
Green Lantern in the comics I may of missed some glaring omissions but
as far as I can tell it was faithful. I&#x27;d of like to of maybe of seen a
cameo by Guy Gardener and I hope it gets picked up for a sequel.
