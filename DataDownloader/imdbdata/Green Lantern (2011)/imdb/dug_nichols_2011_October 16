Very green is the first thing that comes to mind (not the tree hugging
type green &#x96; just the color green.) Did I detect a hidden agenda &#x96;
nope? Did the director deal out subtle blame to the USA for the woes of
the world &#x96; nope? Was some past politician blamed for goofs made by
their successor &#x96; nope? This movie was entertainment, surprise &#x96;
surprise! I was pleasantly pleased &#x96; the movie kept my attention from
beginning to end. Was it juvenile &#x96; duhhhhh &#x96; it&#x27;s a super hero movie &#x96;
it&#x27;s based on a comic book. Folks &#x96; it&#x27;s not real &#x96; it&#x27;s called
escapism. Kind of what Hollywood should be all about &#x96; not pet projects
ginned up by some star&#x27;s isolated fantasy of what life should be. One
must be in the real world &#x96; before they preach about what the real
world should be. Anyways &#x96; I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, the actors
and the plot.
