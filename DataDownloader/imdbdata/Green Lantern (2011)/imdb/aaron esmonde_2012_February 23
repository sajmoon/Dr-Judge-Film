A fearless pilot is chosen by an alien ring that bestows him with
otherworldly powers, tasked with keeping peace within his sector he
finds the responsibly maybe too much for him to handle.<br /><br />Like Thor&#x27;s (2011) Asgard the screen lights up with the scenes set in
Oa featuring the Guardians and other Green Lantern Corps. Notable is
Peter Sarsgaard&#x27;s Hector Hammond who is menacing, however Tim Robbins
is wasted as his father and Blake Lively as Carol Ferris is little more
that eye-candy that has been dressed up to be a stereo type independent
woman. Unfortunately the usually lively and amusing Ryan Reynolds
appears miscast and his trademark quips feel forced. Thankfully an
almost unrecognisable Mark Strong steals every scene as Sinestro.<br /><br />Many of the effects are finely executed especially some of the Corps
monster/alien characters and Abin Sur played by Star Wars&#x27; Temuera
Morrison is particularly memorable. Director Martin Campbell
successfully brings the production together making even the most
mundane scenes visually interesting, that said, the tone feels a little
off at times not sure if it wants to play out true comic book style or
as a dramatic piece.<br /><br />As far a superheros goes Green Lantern is a standard affair, with its
murky and shades of grey sub characters more interesting than Hal
Jordan himself.
