Watching the trailers I expected this to be one of the worst films I
had ever seen. My major concern was what appeared to be very weak and
superficial casting. I would consider the acting to be the biggest
weakness of this movie. Ryan Reynolds may have the look of a superhero,
but he is much better suited for a romantic comedy than an action
flick. Similarly, Blake Lively looks like the perfect superhero love
interest, but in this movie she was also supposed to be a serious
business-type woman. She did not pull this off well.<br /><br />Overall, I was pleasantly surprised. The acting was not great. The
effects could have been stronger and I would have been satisfied
without so many story lines. But I enjoyed seeing the film and do not
think it was one of the worst films I have seen. I think it will fall
in the wayside of many other major summer movies, but Redbox it if you
are in the mood for another good superhero adventure!<br /><br />Redbox/Netflix It!<br /><br />http://burningreview.blogspot.com/
