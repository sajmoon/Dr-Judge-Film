Ryan Reynolds as an all-American superhero could&#x27;ve worked if it wasn&#x27;t
for the terrible script and useless attempts to charm the audience with
goofy humor and stereotype lines. If you&#x27;re really into the comics
world, you might give this movie a chance... otherwise, STAY CLEAR!
It&#x27;s not worth spending 150 minutes of your time on such utter crap.
The acting is not the worst, but the storyline and all the clich&#xE9; makes
it hard to watch. You&#x27;ll find yourself waiting for the end, or wanting
to fall asleep. It might just make &#x22;the worst movie of the year&#x22;. A
total disappointment for any superhero-movie-lover, and especially for
those who don&#x27;t even love this genre.
