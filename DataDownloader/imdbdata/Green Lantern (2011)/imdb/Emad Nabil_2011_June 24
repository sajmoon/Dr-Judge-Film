It&#x27;s a good adaptation from the comics. didn&#x27;t stray far off and didn&#x27;t
give it full justice either, but overall it&#x27;s fun and entertaining to
watch, specially if you don&#x27;t know about the green lanterns and it&#x27;s
your first experience.<br /><br />the story is good, direction and special effects are not bad at all.
what i didn&#x27;t like was the script, it&#x27;s desperate for some good writing
as some of the dialogue were lame and most of the secondary characters
didn&#x27;t get their proper spotlight.<br /><br />I loved Ryan Reynolds he fits the part and he easily could relate his
human weakness to the audience. also the performance by Mark Strong as
Sinestro blew my mind away.
