2011_June 30 
I&#x27;m of a forgiving nature, especially when it comes to sci-fi, special
effects driven, blockbuster movies. I enjoyed the Star Wars prequels, i
even enjoyed the last Indy movie, i gave G.I Joe a decent review....G.I
Joe, yeah, that G.I Joe.<br /><br />I cant go easy on this film, because Warner Bros deserve this, they are
currently at the bottom of a deep pit when it comes to what is arguably
the most popular current genre at the summer box office, super hero
movies.<br /><br />Marvel are wiping the floor with them, Superman had muted return, yes
the Batman films are superb, yes Warners/DC turn out fantastic animated
movies. But this Green Latern movie was going to show they can do more
than just Batman well, it was going to be, hopefully a step towards a
Justice League movie, one day, a less well known DC superhero,
introduced to the non geek public, to open the floodgates to the larger
DC universe than just Superman and Batman.<br /><br />Well with all that riding on it, if this is the best they can do, then
don&#x27;t bother. This was one whopping mess of a film, Batman and Robin
made more sense and yes i really have considered that statement, its
nearly two weeks since i saw the movie, so this is a considered
opinion, not a knee jerk one in the heat of the moment.<br /><br />The characters were characterless, they were&#x27;nt funny, engaging,
sympathetic, there was no emotional resonance in their situations. eg
When Hal returns to Earth, after his initial visit to Oa, the scenes
just drag where we are urged to feel his sense of dissonance with
himself at not excepting the challenge he has been presented with.<br /><br />I felt nothing, no sympathy, no empathy, nothing, it was all intercut
at this stage with the origin of the Hector Hammond character. The
scenes of Hal moping, are set against the scenes with us finding out
that Hammond, already a creepy, sullen character before his head
swells, doesn&#x27;t get on with Dad, who himself is grease ball politician.<br /><br />Remember Spider-Man 2 where Alfred Molina&#x27;s Doc Ock had a pathos to his
story which created a sense of sympathy for him and how that made for
such a layered and involving villain, none of that here thank you very
much.<br /><br />The entire &#x22;i hate you dad&#x22; routine is old, old hat, but something
fresh or dramatic could have been made of it, but instead the &#x22;i&#x27;m
sensitive and dad&#x27;s overbearing&#x22; tentpole is hammered into the ground,
aided by awful dialogue and choppy scene structure.<br /><br />The editing (amazing considering it was Stuart Baird) in these middle
scenes was staccato in tone and numbing, it earned no sympathy for
either character and therefore sabotaged any hope of an emotional pay
off at the end of the film.<br /><br />Superman&#x27;s first appearance on Earth in the Donner version had you
cheering, as Superman saves our feisty, likable damsel in distress Lois
Lane, from a nasty helicopter crash, in front of a diverse social cross
section of the good people of Metropolis. <br /><br />Green Lantern&#x27;s first appearance on Earth leaves you cold, as he saves
an already established grease ball politician, from a nasty helicopter
crash, in front of a gathering of over-achievers and posh-knobs who
frankly you couldn&#x27;t give a tinkers cuss about.<br /><br />My abiding memory of the entire Hammond sub-plot is Peter Sarsgaard
holding his head in his hands and moaning, which is ironic as i joined
him in this action at numerous points.<br /><br />Most unforgivable of all even the action scenes were flat and lifeless
and when considering what Hal&#x27;s character can do with his ring, thats
just not acceptable.<br /><br />On the up side, Oa was very impressive, there are some good effects and
Ryan Reynolds and Mark Strong do their best to carry it off, but they
are let down by other badly handled elements.<br /><br />Mum always said: &#x22;If you&#x27;ve got nothing good to say, say nothing at
all!&#x22;, and mum&#x27;s usually right, but in this case it cost me &#xA3;15, so
sorry Mum, i&#x27;m speaking my Brains !!
