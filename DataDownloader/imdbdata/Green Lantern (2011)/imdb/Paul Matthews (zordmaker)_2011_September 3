Treated myself to this film earlier today, meant to see it sooner,
watched it at the last cinema showing it, on the last session before it
vanished. Glad I did! There&#x27;s been something lacking in superhero
flicks since Spiderman fell from his web - and thank goodness the Green
Lantern has finally got it back.<br /><br />The film draws from all the traditionally successful elements of
superhero flicks. It has a strong story which anyone can understand, is
entertaining and doesn&#x27;t strain the brain. It oozes Good Vs Evil. The
characters are believable. The heroes look like heroes and the villains
likewise look like monsters. No more sitting there guessing who&#x27;se a
goodie or baddie with The Green Lantern.<br /><br />The film paces well and rarely leaves you wishing the cinema had a fast
forward button on the seat. Most of all it has emotion - that thing
which strangely leaves you pretending that you are the hero as you
watch. As you walk out you believe everyone&#x27;s a hero and that tomorrow
at work, you could apply a bit of Green Lantern thinking and save your
own world.<br /><br />&#x22;The Green Lantern&#x22; is a sleeper success, will grow in popularity and
will undoubtedly build a cult following. It certainly doesn&#x27;t deserve
some of the flak that many other reviewers have given it. I guess these
reviewers have gotten used to reviewing complex, tiring and competitive
films and have forgotten the enjoyment of just sitting there and
letting a film just wash all over you.<br /><br />Green Lantern is that sort of film. Unlike many other recent flicks of
it&#x27;s genre, I&#x27;ll be watching The Green Lantern again. Soon.<br /><br />Zordmaker
