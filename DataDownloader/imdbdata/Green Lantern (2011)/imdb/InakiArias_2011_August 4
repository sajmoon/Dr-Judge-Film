I&#x27;ve read some reviews before watching the film. More of them are
disappointing and they focus in the bad CGI, lack of action and epic,
even in Reynold&#x27;s bad acting.&#x22;Always the same negative points&#x22;, I
thought to myself, and how many times, after reading some bad reviews I
have found out that the film was, actually, amazing. This is not the
case, trust me.<br /><br />Firstly, I love the character. Green Lantern is my favorite superhero,
matched with Superman. Secondly, I love the complex story, the
characters and its wonderful and plenty imaginative setting <br /><br />But the film fails in everything. As I&#x27;ve said before, another
reviewers focus their angry in details (a lot of them), but the problem
is bigger, is an overall problem.<br /><br />The plot is horrible, how is it possible to tell such a big and epic
adventure in this poorly way, I can&#x27;t believe it! The CGIs aren&#x27;t good,
but they are probably the best of the film.<br /><br />The dialogs are amazingly stupid, even for this kind of film. The
conversations between Hal and Carol, are worse, for example, than the
ones of Annakin and Padme in Chapter II, or, even worse than the
&#x22;romantic&#x22; ones of Spidey and Mary Jone in Spiderman.<br /><br />The acting doesn&#x27;t make the cut, too! And here comes the worst part:
the directing. Stupid direction of actors, the worst sense of rhythm
that I have never seen in a &#x22;blockbuster&#x22; like this. Not epic, not
emotion, not laughs, not cries, not screams, not surprise...<br /><br />If it wasn&#x27;t Green Lantern and if it was a new for movie created
character I would give to this movie a worse note.<br /><br />4 out of 10, and thanks! (Go to watch it with friends, cause it&#x27;s the
only way to enjoy somehow with this piece of trash)
