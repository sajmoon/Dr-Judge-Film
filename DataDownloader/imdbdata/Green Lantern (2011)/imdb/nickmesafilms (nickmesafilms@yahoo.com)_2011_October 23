&#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; is the third superhero movie I have seen this year.
Ryan Reynolds plays Hal Jordan, a normal former U.S. pilot who has been
chosen to become the Green Lantern after a dying purple alien arrives
to Earth and gives him a ring and a lantern. Now, out of the two
superhero movies I have so far seen this year, like &#x22;Thor&#x22; and &#x22;X-Men:
First Class&#x22;, &#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; is the most unoriginal, mildly empty, and
completely lacking superhero movie ever. Almost everything in this
movie can&#x27;t somewhat relate to a superhero movie. I only enjoy Ryan
Reynolds as a comedy actor, and he&#x27;s not that much of a professional
superhero. I think he uses too much of his comedy skills in this one.
The only three actors in this movie that showed either good or
excellent performances were Blake Lively, Geoffrey Rush, and mostly
Peter Sarsgard, who was the only one that stole the whole movie. On the
other hand, this movie has nothing you would expect to see. It&#x27;s an
hour too quick, there&#x27;s not that much of a real plot, the characters
were &#x22;ok&#x22;, there&#x27;s limited action, and only half of the cast was
actually good. But all the weird creatures on some sort of planet in
this movie, they were all silly, except for Geoffrey Rush. I could
somewhat care less about this plot, because it doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of
exciting and thrilling material. The visual effects are maybe cool, but
they are unintentionally funny. &#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; is a lack of action, a
lack of heart, and a lack of character. But mostly, there is nothing
&#x22;that horrible&#x22; about this movie, because the whole movie is just
popcorn entertainment. This movie had its moments, and I enjoyed them a
bit. It didn&#x27;t really matter to me that much. But, this movie was
actually funny throughout, which is not good for a superhero flick.
&#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; is a good example when somebody takes a superhero film,
tries to make it look awesome, but it&#x27;s just unintentionally empty.
This movie wasn&#x27;t either that good or that bad. I think this is a movie
that should be left for audiences, so go see it if you dare, just to
get this all over with. &#x22;Green Lantern&#x22;, in my review, &#x22;an alright
popcorn movie, but somewhat dull&#x22;.
