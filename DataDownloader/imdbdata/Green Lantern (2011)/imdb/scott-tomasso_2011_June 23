I&#x27;ve read some of the other user reviews and I find a lot of them
laughable. Was this a great movie? No. Was it a bad movie? No, of
course not. I went into Green Lantern the same way I would go into - oh
I don&#x27;t know - a &#x22;Hangover&#x22; movie. You pretty much know what you&#x27;re
going to get. I suppose, however, that most of the same critic wannabes
I had the displeasure of reading will probably go into the &#x22;Smurfs&#x22;
movie with their quippy lines and well thought out rants already typed
up and ready to send. It&#x27;s easier to jump on the band wagon, than it is
to be honest I guess.<br /><br />Personally, I thought Green Lantern was fairly good. Now, I should
preface that with the fact that I already knew a bit about the ring
wearing superhero before going in. That doesn&#x27;t mean, however, that I
wouldn&#x27;t have been entertained otherwise. In fact, I thought the movie
was entertaining. Granted, it seemed rushed (and it was), but I left
the movie theater feeling neither giddy nor disappointed. I jut wanted
more. I wish there was more. More action, more fighting, more build up.
Just...more.<br /><br />To those of you bashing the special effects or the storyline...you
obviously don&#x27;t know much about Green Lantern. And that&#x27;s fine. This
movie obviously isn&#x27;t for you. Have fun watching the &#x22;Smurfs&#x22;.
