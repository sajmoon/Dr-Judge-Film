Ryan Reynolds sucked in Comic Book movies (Blade: Trinity, and X-Men
Origins: Wolverine). This time in the Green Lantern he did a really
good job. Critics have been giving this movie negative reviews even
Rotten Tomatoes started off giving the movie 23%. I believe that the
Critics should watch the movie again and take back everything they said
about the movie the first time. This movie has pretty good humor, very
cool special effects I&#x27;m guessing that it will be nominated for an
Oscar, the action is pretty cool, it&#x27;s climax was pretty good even
though I expected to see more but it was still decent. I&#x27;m sure that
the Comic Book fans won&#x27;t be disappointed with Ryan Reynolds playing
the Green Lantern.
