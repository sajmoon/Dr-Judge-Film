Some people have some difficult baggage to deal with in their lives.
Hal Jordan is one such man, but I can only conclude that he dealt with
it all before this film began. The potential of this film was nearly
infinite. Take a character who is chosen without reason or logic to
accept a power that allows him to do virtually anything at any point,
and then pit him in a literal battle of wills with a power we all
instinctively fear. Magic, right? Not quite if you do it like this.<br /><br />The difficulty is trying to work out how it didn&#x27;t work. All the major
elements are there and, although I was somewhat surprised, even Ryan
Reynolds was an excellent choice for Hal. He plays it as flippant and
yet complex...and then the script fails to do either.<br /><br />Where was the struggle? In fact, where was it in any of the characters?
Each lacks in their own way right from Silestro to the love interest.
The result is a film that, as the marketing people played on, is much
anticipated, but then leaves you wondering &#x22;was that it?&#x22;<br /><br />I love a superhero film. Reason being that, for a brief moment and with
millions of fans across the globe, we get to access a part of ourselves
that is more than we can be. We do this by watching a character who can
do the same. But not in this case. The plot is there, the actors too,
the premise is a given, but the delivery is poor. Next time (and I
believe there will be one) find a writer who can create a character in
the same way Jordan can create a chainsaw. It&#x27;s not subtle, but it does
what needs to be done.
