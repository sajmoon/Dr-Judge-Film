It was Awesome and IMO a very good movie. I liked the Story, the acting
was good, CGI was amazing, and the movie was very fun!! There were a
few flaws..I thought the villain Hector Hammond as Parallax&#x27;s Minion
was rather weird, odd, and i really don&#x27;t think he was needed. I don&#x27;t
know anything about the comic books so if I seem misinformed of
information please let me know! The 3D was great IMO. There were some
scenes it felt like it wasn&#x27;t even converted well but overall the 3D
was good! 3D was my only option because the last 2D showing was late at
night :( regardless my 3D showing was 80% Full. I really hope WB gives
Green lantern and Ryan Reynolds another chance at a sequel because I
see so much potential in future installments. I also hope to see a
compromise in WB&#x27;s current plans with the justice league movie because
I want to see Christian Bale, Henry Cavill, and Ryan Reynolds reprise
their respected roles. I recommend the movie to others you should
definitely check it out In 2D or 3D their both great. I hope it makes a
great sum of money because i personally think it deserves to. Again
these are just my opinions I expect people to agree with me and people
to Disagree with me but thats the fun point in talking movies we bring
our thoughts to the table and just talk film. anyways GO SEE &#x22;GREEN |O|
