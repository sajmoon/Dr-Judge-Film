It&#x27;s a superhero movie, not an Oscar-winning drama. It is what it is.
So, going in to see this movie, I expected the typical
&#x22;intro-to-the-superhero&#x22; routine that all superhero movies must endure
- for fans of the green lantern, a fair amount of the storyline is of
course unnecessary (but tolerable) - for newcomers to the lantern
scene, these details are a requirement, particularly for sequels.
Beyond the intro and background component, the movie was a great for
what it was, having a decent storyline, reasonable casting, excellent
SFX, and an adrenaline-filled &#x22;final battle&#x22;. The writers did leave a
few angles untapped as well, opening several opportunities for future
lantern movies that I look forward to. And, as usual, the superhero
gets the girl but hey... it is what it is. Definitely worth watching.
