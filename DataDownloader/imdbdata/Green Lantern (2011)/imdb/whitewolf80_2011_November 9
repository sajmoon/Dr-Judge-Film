Green Lantern was an OK movie as superhero movies go. Sure it ain&#x27;t
gonna win no Oscars and it definitely ain&#x27;t Shakespeare but who cares?!
It was still a lot of fun with great visuals and special effects. Ryan
Reynolds was terrific as Hal Jordan and the supporting cast was great
too. I think there was either a conspiracy against this movie or too
many critics have become too jaded (poetic use of a green gem totally
intended!) and need to take a decade or so off from watching films. Or
possibly it didn&#x27;t fit in with their preconceived notion of what this
movie should have been. Well, if you like superhero flicks it&#x27;s
definitely worth seeing.
