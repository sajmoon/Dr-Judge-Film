They say that if you&#x27;ve seen one superhero movie, you&#x27;ve seen them all.
That&#x27;s not entirely true, but if every superhero movie were like Green
Lantern, then it would be true. Green Lantern is your typical superhero
movie, so if you&#x27;ve seen quite a few superhero movies (like I have),
you&#x27;ll know what&#x27;s ahead. This is the problem with Green Lantern, it&#x27;s
too predictable and does nothing new to make it stand out from the
crowd. That&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing though, but it&#x27;s not a good
thing either. There are 3 good things in this movie. One, Peter
Sarsgaard as Hector Hammond is delightfully hammy and fun to watch.
Two, the SFX are cool and what they do with the Green Lantern ring is
also cool, and Parallax&#x27;s design suits its evilness. Third, the fight
between Hal and Parallax is the best scene in the movie. Other than
those things, it&#x27;s average. If you&#x27;ve never seen a superhero movie
and/or are a Green Lantern fan, this movie is worth seeing. Everyone
else should see X-Men: First Class.
