There is a good movie in here, somewhere. But it looks like the
original cut was at least an hour longer, after which it was trimmed
down to the current length. The result is a emotionless and incoherent
story. <br /><br />For example, at the start of the film Hal Jordan, the lead character,
meets four characters - three adults and a kid. One presumes these
people are family or friends or something. Who knows? They never appear
in the story again, making their very appearance pointless. At a later
stage the main character meets with a prominent group of elders and
talks to them as if he&#x27;s met them before - but he never did. And the
final fight is, frankly, appalling after the build-up towards its
supposed menace. <br /><br />These are just a few of many major plot holes and crack-filling during
Green Lantern. It&#x27;s hard to get sucked into this yarn and the special
effects, while nice, soon become so commonplace that they don&#x27;t do
anything for the experience.
