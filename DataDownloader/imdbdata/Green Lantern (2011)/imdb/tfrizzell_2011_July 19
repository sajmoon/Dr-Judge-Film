A test pilot (Ryan Reynolds) is given a green ring by a dying space
alien which can allow him superpowers to help protect the universe.
Intergalactic protection is quickly needed as college professor Peter
Sarsgaard becomes our super-villain via a virus-like element from space
which grants him frightening physical and mental capabilities. Special
effects-laden dog struggles from its starting point to generate much
interest and intensity. Reynolds makes for a fascinating superhero, but
ultimately he disappoints in the title role. Love interest Blake Lively
looks good, but makes little impression and supporting players like Tim
Robbins and Angela Bassett seem like they are in the wrong movie
completely and that their best work is light-years behind them. Voice
characterizations by legitimate supporters Geoffrey Rush and Michael
Clarke Duncan add to the head-scratching career choices present here.
The screenplay is a flop, the direction seems lost, and even the
special effects fall flat as the movie tries to advance into something
more than it is. Lights out quickly on this superhero dud. 2 stars out
of 5.
