lets get it straight...i knew this movie was gonna be bad...but was way
worse...this was jus like a stage performance or like a series....it
was never upto the standards of a superhero movie.the first half was a
little better but second half made me ache.Ryan reynolds was good but
he didn&#x27;t get a good script,shame.Mark Strong was also wasted and the
concept itself was funny as i didn&#x27;t know anything about the comic.but
even they cud&#x27;ve managed to make it better.this was a total let down
work except the 3d which was better than recent movies.This movie
cud&#x27;ve at least been like Thor which solely was an entertainer with
mediocre script and good action.i think Green lantern was made for
comic fans.others just stay away.
