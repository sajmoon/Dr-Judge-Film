Having just watched Green Lantern, I must say I&#x27;m kind of relieved that
this portrayal of a superhero didn&#x27;t go down the dark, introspective
road of self discovery, but chooses the light, fun way of bringing the
eternal battle of good and evil on screen. I mean, it&#x27;s a superhero
movie, not existentialist drama or something.<br /><br />The visuals are fittingly bright and colorful, Oa looks especially
great. Actor performances good enough, with Mark Strong and Ryan
Reynolds leading the way.<br /><br />In the end, I&#x27;m not saying this movie is a masterpiece, but it&#x27;s a fine
piece of light summer entertainment.
