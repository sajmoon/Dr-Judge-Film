Don&#x27;t listen to the reviews or critics, this film was a credit to the
green lantern character and the DC universe. Ryan Reynolds played the
act brilliantly and perfectly, the CGI was stunning, admittedly, the 3D
was rubbish, but isn&#x27;t it always? The costume for the green lantern
looks so real with every detail fine tuned to perfection. There is
intense and awesome action scenes, there is comedy and there is a
brilliant backdrop and plot, all these things come together very well
to make the perfect superhero movie. If you don&#x27;t believe me, rent this
film when it comes out and judge for yourself, don&#x27;t let me or the
critics sway your opinion.
