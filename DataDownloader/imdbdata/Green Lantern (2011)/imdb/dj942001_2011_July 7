This movie was really boring for me, seems like it didn&#x27;t have enough
action in it I&#x27;m not gonna tell exactly what happened in the movie
because I don&#x27;t want to spoil it but, if you watch the cartoon movie
made by(I think) WB you will actually know whats gonna happen its
almost scene for scene, with one difference, the cartoon actually shows
more and is more developed. I&#x27;m a big comic book fan but this movie
just didn&#x27;t do it for me, maybe it was because it was in 3D and within
the first hour I was bored, and after that I was just counting the
minutes till it was over, but one thing that would help the movie and
I&#x27;m warning you, do not watch the cartoon movie before going to see
this, if you want to watch it, do it after the live action movie, I
believe that&#x27;s mostly why I didn&#x27;t like it, because I had recently
watched the cartoon movie. sorry if this offended you and you thought
the movie was the best of the year.
