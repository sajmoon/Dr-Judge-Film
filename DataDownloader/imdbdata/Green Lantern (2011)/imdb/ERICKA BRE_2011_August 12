Amazing film, definitely the best superhero film in the last years!; An
excellent use of visual effects and the main character with great
attitude, just a good movie, thumbs up!! Although there are changes to
the story are minor adjustments that help the continuity of the script.
The key lines of the main character makes you understand the philosophy
of the hero. Despite the lukewarm reception from critics consider this
film is far superior to what is described and even what to expect after
watching the trailers. It shows that enthusiasm goes beyond the fear,
which makes these teachings to the level of Yoda himself. Since the
beginning of the movie shows agile and witty, giving us an opportunity
to recognize the background of each character. For connoisseurs of the
Green Lantern comic will be a joy to see the conformation of Oa and the
deployment of power and charm of the Green Lanterns.
