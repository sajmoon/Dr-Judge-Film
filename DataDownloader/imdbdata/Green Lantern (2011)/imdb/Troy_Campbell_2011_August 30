Ryan Reynolds is an obvious choice to play a cocky, womanising,
daredevil pilot; he oozes charisma and has great comic timing, the only
two things required for such a role. Unfortunately, his turn as Hal
Jordan &#x96; the first human to be inducted into the Green Lantern, an
intergalactic force that keeps the universe safe &#x96; isn&#x27;t gifted with a
strong enough story. Director Martin Campbell (who breathed life back
into James Bond with Casino Royale) offers a verdant superhero flick
that never strays from the &#x27;Superhero for Dummies&#x27; handbook; complete
with a daft narrative prologue and a plot arc that is predictable to
the point of tedium. Despite this, Lantern very nearly succeeds as a
decent night out thanks to the imaginative special effects and string
of tongue-in-cheek humour throughout. Young boys will love it.
