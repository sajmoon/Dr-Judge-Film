Green Lantern has never been quite as popular as some of the other
heroes in the DC Comics stable&#x97;Superman and Batman, for instance&#x97;but
he&#x27;s been around in various incarnations since 1940, and is a mainstay
of the superhero universe. He&#x27;s also one of the most powerful heroes in
comics&#x97;blessed with a ring which bestows virtually unlimited powers
upon its wearer, Green Lantern is frequently rated as one of the two
most powerful members of the Justice League (along with Superman,
naturally). Given his neat powers and renowned history, it was only a
matter of time before Green Lantern made it to the big screen.<br /><br />And the wait has been worth it. The story begins when test pilot Hal
Jordan discovers what appears to be nothing less than a crashed UFO.
Without a second thought, Jordan pulls the injured occupant of the
alien vessel out of the wreckage and tries in vain to save his life.
But before he passes away, the alien informs Jordan that he has been
chosen to wear the ring of a Green Lantern. Baffled, Jordan buries the
stranger from the stars and takes the aforementioned ring&#x97;and its
lantern-like battery&#x97;back home with him. Gradually, Jordan discovers
that the ring can draw upon his own willpower and project beams of
green energy with which the wearer can form nearly anything
imaginable&#x97;force fields, giant bulldozers, glowing swords, even machine
guns and gargantuan fists. But when Jordan is called before the
Guardians of the Universe and the rest of the Green Lantern Corps, he
learns that with this power comes enormous responsibility&#x85;and that he
will only achieve his full potential if he can overcome his personal
fears. Meanwhile, the very embodiment of fear, a monstrous being known
as Parallax, flies through outer space toward Earth. Can Jordan
overcome his inner demons and rise to the world&#x27;s defense? Or will fear
be his undoing&#x97;and that of the Earth as well? It&#x27;s an epic plot,
perhaps the most ambitious in the history of superhero films, but
director Martin Campbell pulls it off. The story is brought magically
to life with some of the best computer generated effects ever captured
on film, and the assorted aliens, monsters, and action scenes the plot
throws at us are all rendered with an almost ethereal beauty and sense
of wonder. Thanks no doubt to the unique animated effects and set
pieces, the movie even looks good in 3D (wonder of wonders!). I would
even go so far as to say it is the most expertly rendered 3D film yet
produced.<br /><br />The cast does an incredible job. Ryan Reynolds would probably not be my
first choice to play Green Lantern/Hal Jordan, but despite my
misgivings he does a standout job, capturing Jordan&#x27;s transformation
from reckless immaturity to sober heroism with an entirely believable
portrayal of an iconic comics figure. Blake Lively has been criticized
for perhaps being a few years too young for the part of Carol Ferris,
Jordan&#x27;s on-again, off-again girlfriend and boss, but there&#x27;s nothing
wrong with how she actually plays the part and in fact the movie
wouldn&#x27;t work without her. And no, it doesn&#x27;t hurt that she&#x27;s totally
hot. This could be a big breakthrough role for Lively, and the chance
to see her reprise the part is a big reason to hope for a sequel.
Naturally, Carol&#x27;s love provides Jordan with the inspiration he needs
to ultimately prove himself worthy of the title &#x22;hero.&#x22; Mark Strong is
outstanding as the enigmatic Green Lantern Sinestro, and Peter
Sarsgaard delivers a knockout performance as Hector Hammond, an
ordinary mortal infected by the evil of Parallax and slowly transformed
into a being only barely human. The parallel lives of Hammond and
Jordan play out the ultimate differences between a life lived on
willpower, or fear. The final battle between Jordan and Parallax is
cinematic magic, accompanied by a stirring recitation of the Green
Lantern&#x27;s vow that may be the most inspiring moment in ANY superhero
film to date.<br /><br />Visually glorious, never boring, and well executed on almost every
technical front, Green Lantern is a terrific addition to the ever
expanding canon of live-action comic book adaptations. A scene after
the credits sets up a promising sequel. Here&#x27;s hoping we don&#x27;t have
long to wait.
