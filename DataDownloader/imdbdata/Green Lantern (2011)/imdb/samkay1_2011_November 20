If Nikelodeon&#x27;s Danny Phantom was done as a movie, it would probably
look identical to Green Lantern.<br /><br />Green Lantern, at its core, suffers from a basic lack of ambition, and
the finished product feels like a money grab. Green Lantern wants to
dazzle an audience in superficial ways, and to some degree it does.
flying faster than the speed of light across galaxies was kind of
memorable, and I thought the fight scenes (short though they were) had
a good scope and spectacle to them. Otherwise, the film did little for
me.<br /><br />The Green Lantern keeps hamming the overcoming fear message down the
viewers throat, but the irony is that the film itself is too afraid. It
is unwilling to go to the depth that is necessary to make this a decent
origin story. Ryan Reynolds lacks the charisma and emotional range that
the role definitely needs, but if nothing else, at least he plays the
few comedic moments well enough. Blake Lively is adorable, but there
are moments when it sounds like she is reading off cue cards. It&#x27;s a
shame because I think they had the potential to make a great screen
couple. I think a better screenplay would have helped. For me, Mark
Strong had the most memorable character in the show, which is weird,
because he has almost nothing to do.<br /><br />The plot is silly to begin with and highly unoriginal. Even derivative
movies can be good sometimes (I&#x27;ll site Avatar) but the Green Lantern&#x27;s
sort of obvious scrappiness doesn&#x27;t cut it. Director Martin Campbell to
some degree is able to build dramatic momentum to the climax,
Considering the imaginative new world that we are exposed to, and
(among other things) the size and scope of his shots, with thousands of
little CGI green lanterns, I was expecting something a little better
than what I got. It was too hard to ignore the fact that our hero
single handedly fights the forces of evil within touching distance of
the sun and he doesn&#x27;t even sweat let alone burn up in a millisecond.
Superheroes are super, but aren&#x27;t invincible to the laws of the
universe, or are they?<br /><br />The end product is like watching a really flashy video game for an
hundred minutes. It was a shallow experience, but perhaps that&#x27;s enough
for some. I didn&#x27;t think it was a terrible film, it&#x27;s just rather
fundamental.
