The Green Lantern movie suffered from trying to do TOO MUCH with 1 hr.
and 45 minutes. Parallax didn&#x27;t come along until late in the game, in
the comics, and slightly pre-dated the Hal Jordan re-birth into Green
Lantern. Probably Geoff Johns association with the project and Geoff
being the author of Green Lantern - Secret Origins, explains this. The
problem is that they may now have ruled out such things as Jordan
becoming the Spectre, before he goes through the &#x22;Rebirth&#x22; to become GL
again.<br /><br />Those are GREAT story lines, written by Johns, but may now be hard to
accommodate given this continuity. Too much liberty was taken with the
need for GL to recharge his power ring by reciting the oath in the
PRESENCE of his power battery. This should be a unifying element for
ALL future GL movies, but given the box office performance, it may be
hard to convince Ryan Reynolds to reprise his role, and to bring to
fruition Sinestro trying on the yellow power ring. Hope they give Flash
a better inaugural. I don&#x27;t need the Speed Force in the first Flash
movie!! Hope they also did enough to warrant a second GL movie and keep
Ryan Reynolds or the implications of the Sinestro scene, post credits,
will not see the light of day.
