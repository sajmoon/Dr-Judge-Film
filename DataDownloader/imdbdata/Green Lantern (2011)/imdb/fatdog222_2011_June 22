... all Superhero movie conventions aside<br /><br />If you know how films are made you will not be at all blown away by the
parts of this film that aren&#x27;t computer generated imagery.. anyone with
a film major and a few million bucks to spare should be able to put the
slap happy scenes together without any real difficulty.<br /><br />The computer generated imagery is quite aesthetically pleasing. Panning
has never been more enjoyable.<br /><br />The score seemed very generic like it was copy pasted from inception..
(thats a joke)<br /><br />Casting.. Ryan Reynolds played this part in Star Trek already. The girl
was hot as usual and the mad scientist was a mad scientist... The end?
Na don&#x27;t worry there is more to it than that<br /><br />Overall if you are a critic and a cynic like my self then this film
will have you &#x27;entertained&#x27; until the credits end..... If you are not a
&#x27;film buff&#x27; then you should love it until the lights come on. =[)
