After costing his company and the US government thousands of dollars by
being reckless in a jet test(after which he&#x27;s attacked by flashbacks
ripping off Top Gun), Hal Jordan is fired(and you have to wonder why
that hadn&#x27;t happened sooner, as it didn&#x27;t seem like it was the only
time he did something like that) from his pilot job. He&#x27;s then
recruited for the Green Lantern corps(wait, if they&#x27;re all called GL&#x27;s,
how do they tell them apart? Between themselves, they use their real
names, but they have secret identities, so what about in public? This
does at least comment on the mask not being a good cover, although
you&#x27;d think with how ridiculous it looks in this, it&#x27;s supposed to
distract people from how obvious it is), and he takes it remarkably
well. Not because it&#x27;s a trait of his, it&#x27;s one of the many results of
the poor script. Anyway, around that same time, Parallax, the
terrifying force of anxiety using the power of fear(that manifests in
telekinesis, for some reason... and hearing negative thoughts directed
towards oneself and the ability to absorb memories through physical
contact, making even less sense), infects a human scientist and is
headed towards Earth, and it&#x27;s astonishing how little we care(that
would be zilch). In general, this doesn&#x27;t get you emotionally invested.
It plays it far too safe, hitting all the notes(and Hollywood clich&#xE9;s)
for this kind of thing, trying to get itself an audience instead of
trying to be well-done(it will get attention if it is). This is
visually impressive and the 3D can be pretty nice, and that&#x27;s about the
full extent of the positives. Well, a few of the constructs(that the
Ring produces, from the willpower of the wearer) are somewhat clever.
Our villain plays like a low-rent Igor. Some scenes are there to show
off things, and have no consequence. The music is forgettable, as are
many of the characters. I swear, the lead has a friend, and I couldn&#x27;t
tell you one single thing about him. Personality, name, nothing.
Ryan... Reynolds his way through the entire thing(dude, I know you can
play a role seriously, and I&#x27;m certain you can be spot-on in a
superhero flick, just start reading the material before signing on).
Mark Strong as Sinestro is great, as the only saving grace. Lively&#x27;s
part is meant to be a strong female(I would think...?), only she comes
off as annoying. The will vs. dread conflict is interesting, and there
are points made about both. This isn&#x27;t boring, I didn&#x27;t constantly want
it to end, it just never got me engaged. The action has its moments,
and the brief climax is cool and relatively epic. I recommend this to
fans of the silver age. Nah, most people shouldn&#x27;t bother. 5/10
