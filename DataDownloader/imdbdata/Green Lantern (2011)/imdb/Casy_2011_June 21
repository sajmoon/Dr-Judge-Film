I am not a big fan of DC and have not heard of Green Lantern until I
watched the movie. I find this movie not impressive at all, because it
really fits many criteria of a typical superhero film, from how the bad
guys destroy the world, how the hero saves the world, cheesy lines to
bad guys are always the uglier ones. I don&#x27;t mean disrespect towards
the Green Lantern fans but I burst into laughs several times
(accompanied with some frustration) simply because the story line is
really predictable and simple, or the lines are too cheesy. At some
point it may seem to suit audience of all age but I find that it may
not be favoured by adult audience who may prefer a little bit more
complexity or surprises in the movie.<br /><br />This is a movie about the war of imagination and creativity between the
good and evil, in which the movie lacks of these both itself. I was
disappointed because I was expecting something different, but it was
just made up of combination of many familiar scenes from other movies,
such as from Superman, Scott Pilgrim versus The World, and random
man-made stuff as major part of the fighting strategies. Besides, their
main character seemed rather too well-adjusted to the sudden
unexplained things happening to him. Comparing this to X-men First
Class, the reaction of the mutants when they first found out their own
ability seemed to be a lot more acceptable.<br /><br />No doubt the CG effects are acceptable, and there were a few really
funny lines, but that&#x27;s it. For a comic that has its first appearance
in 1940s, it is totally understandable how popular it could be for
those who grew up with it, just that I could only say this movie is not
my cup of tea in this era.
