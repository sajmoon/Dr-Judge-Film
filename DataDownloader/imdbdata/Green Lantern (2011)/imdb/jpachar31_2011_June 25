&#x27;In Brightest Day, In Blackest Night, No Evil Shall Escape My Sight.
Let Those Who Worship Evil&#x27;s Might Beware My Power -- Green Lantern&#x27;s
Might.&#x27; &#x96; The motto that has the Summer of 2011 talking about. What is
it about evil that it can be nothing but good? I can only guess two
words &#x96; pure evil. The bright part, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be green, I
expected it to be white. But what do I know. I do know that this movie
has surpassed the other super-hero movie: Thor by a landslide. Ryan
Reynolds &#x96; yes sir &#x96; you talk about doing the green suit justice. The
radar has been lifted, and it can never be down thanks to this great
actor. <br /><br />This movie was in one sense of the word &#x96;INCREDIBLE!!!! I loved it.
Kudos goes to the director Martin Campbell. There was something that
stuck out to me in this movie and that was you can&#x27;t be afraid to take
on the responsibility to embrace what you need to become but embrace
the thing that you want most of all &#x96; not to fear.
