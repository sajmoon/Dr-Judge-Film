This movie is too far away from Green Lantern Comic book. If you are
hardcore Green Lantern comic book and if you are planning for this
movie then Sorry guys better buy some Donuts. Some of the graphics are
good in this movie but in the end Story Matters. Martin Campbell has
done a good job again in Direction. But after Golden Eye &#x26; Casino
Royale this movie is not that much good like his earlier films. Well
now some good news for Ryan Renolds fans, Well its a very good start
for him. Yes after this movie we can imagine him as a superhero
character. Angela Basset is okay as Amanda Waller, but the character is
really only in the movie for about fifteen minutes, so there&#x27;s nothing
particularly bad or good about her performance. Mark Strong is
spectacular as Sinestro. He perfectly captures the essence of the
character from the comics. At the end of the movie, the character does
have an abrupt personality change, which makes no sense when compared
to the after credits scene. The script had major problems. I don&#x27;t know
what they want to show. It&#x27;s like 90&#x27;s flick. Production design of this
film is good background score is good.<br /><br />Totally for Kids Not for Adults.
