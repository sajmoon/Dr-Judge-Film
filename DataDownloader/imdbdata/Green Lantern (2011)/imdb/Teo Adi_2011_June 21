Puncher line: I see a lot of negative reviews ... but they are wrong!<br /><br />OK, someone can argue about actors performance, script, scenes
transition between earth and space, movie length, etc.<br /><br />But is this movie so bad to be rated as a mediocre B production ? I
don&#x27;t think so.<br /><br />The kid in me like it. It has great CGI, a cheese but enjoyable main
character. I mean , common, who can take seriously a green guy who can
manipulate universe with the power of &#x22;will&#x22;. It&#x27;s a light joke, meant
to be taken accordingly. When he comes, after saving his girl, to
collect the anonymous kiss in the style of Batman, she sees who he is
with easy, and does justice to all viewers screaming &#x22;it&#x27;s just a tinny
mask&#x22;. This defines the movie.<br /><br />Is not Shakespeare and we are not reviewing such a thing. Beside, there
is no need to tell the story of the movie. What you saw in trailers is
almost all there is, but is still fun enough to worth watch it.
