For those who are desensitized to any and all great effects, decent
stories, and spectacular production values, this will be a so-so movie,
but if you still have the ability to carry some form of wonder in your
heart, this was pretty darned good. I had no problem with the principal
actors, their performance, or the execution of their characters. I
enjoyed the repartee between Hal and his love interest.<br /><br />I thought the intro was pretty spot on with the earlier editions of the
comic, and I think the remainder of the film is a great introduction to
the franchise. But I do say &#x22;introduction.&#x22; Honestly, without a
follow-up or two, this intro will fall flat. It sets the audience up
for something more; something bigger. So without it, this doesn&#x27;t work.
As a stand alone movie, it IS so-so, but if we are given a sequel or
two, the grandeur of this film will pay off.<br /><br />My biggest disappointment is in the Blu-Ray release. The &#x22;digital copy&#x22;
is NOT a digital copy. It&#x27;s an ultraviolet copy from flixter and you
have to put it on your android phone, iPad, or computer to watch it. My
iPod is how I watch movies on the go, so this didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;ll
be looking out for that Ultraviolet Digital Copy warning next time. I
want my $5 back for the upgrade that wasn&#x27;t.
