From director Martin Campbell (&#x22;Casino Royale&#x22;, &#x22;The Mask of Zorro&#x22;)
comes &#x22;Green Lantern&#x22;, a silly, vapid comic-book film about a silly
character with a downright silly power. This Ryan Reynolds vehicle is
pretty much dead on arrival, save for a few likable characters and a
few hilariously campy moments. Despite being a &#x22;bad&#x22; movie, it has some
watchability and settles at &#x22;average.&#x22; <br /><br />Reynolds stars as Hal Jordan, a cocky fighter pilot whose father died
(quite humorously and over-the-top, I might add) in a tragic accident
when he was a child. He flies jets for Ferris aircrafts, run in part by
Hammond (Tim Robins). He is close to his childhood friends Carol (Blake
Lively) and Hector, son of Hammond, played by Peter Sarsgard. But he is
reckless and haunted by the death of his father, also a fighter pilot,
whom is killed in a flashback sequence. (At least in the extended cut
of the film that I saw, although I hear parts or even all of this scene
are omitted in the theatrical cut.) At the same time, an alien named
&#x22;Abin Sur&#x22;, a legendary &#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; (guardians of the universe whom
have special pseudo-magic/pseudo-scientific rings that allow them to
conjure up whatever they can imagine) is injured by a ruthless creature
named Paralax and crashes on Earth. He finds Jordan and entrusts him
with his power-ring to take his place as a Lantern, and despite
hesitation, Jordan gives in and decides to help stop the evil Paralax
from destroying the world.<br /><br />On paper, though basic, this isn&#x27;t a bad set-up for a fun little comic
book adventure with some good action and great imagination&#x85; and at
times, this film does have some good action and great imagination.
However, it is also an extremely flawed film for a number of reasons,
and can never elevate itself beyond the level of &#x22;meh.&#x22; <br /><br />Acting wise, this film is very mixed. I&#x27;m not really Pro-Ryan Reynolds
or Anti-Ryan Reynolds. I like him in some roles while I detest him in
others, but here, I didn&#x27;t know what to think. He isn&#x27;t acting, he&#x27;s
simply playing an exaggerated version of himself. He&#x27;s a wise-cracking
oaf who at times is completely unlikeable while at others times quite
charming. You&#x27;ll hate his guts in one scene, then love him in the next.
Lively is just a mannequin- she is given no good lines or development
to work with. Robins tries, but can&#x27;t do anything with his bland
material either. Sarsgard is an enigma- he is so over-the-top (several
times shrieking like a 5-year-old girl in unintentionally campy
moments), yet at the same time, still the most realistic character. He
ends up getting turned into one of the villains, and he is fun to watch
as a bad-guy, so he gets kudos. Mark Strong stands out as Sinestro, one
of the lanterns who looks like an old-fashioned depiction of the devil
(with red skin and a goatee), and he actually plays his role quite
well.<br /><br />The script is a huge part of the problem of the film. It&#x27;s very, very,
very poorly paced. Nothing happens for nearly the first hour of the
film (at least in the extended cut, where Jordan doesn&#x27;t even get the
ring until the 30 minute mark, then doesn&#x27;t do any heroic action for
another 45 minutes), then too much happens too quickly, and the gravity
of the situation never sets in.<br /><br />The development is also troubling and riddled with inconsistencies and
errors. Particularly troubling is the first scene in which Jordan
becomes a Lantern and starts training- he trains for approximately 5
minutes of screen time (not even in montage, this is his first training
session depicted in real time and it lasts less than five minutes), and
suddenly he just gives up and decides he doesn&#x27;t want to be a Lantern.
(This is one of his most unlikable scenes, as it makes him seem like an
enormous spoiled brat for giving up so outlandishly quickly) Until 15
minutes later in the film, when, even though he only trained his powers
for five minutes, he is somehow able to save a huge party and perfectly
use his powers, before deciding he does want to be a Lantern. This is a
VERY messy film, with a lot of logic and plot problems.<br /><br />The film is well-directed, however. Even though there is very little
action, what action there is, is very thrilling and imaginative. Some
have complained that Jordon never does anything interesting with his
powers, but I disagree- he uses his ring to conjure up all sorts of
stuff- cars, jets, drills, giant fists, mini-guns, springs that launch
trucks through the air- I thought the power was well-depicted in the
film. Also, Campbell does have a great sci-fi flair, and all of the
outer-space and alien world sequences are startlingly detailed and very
epic. They were almost worth the price of admission alone. And even
though the early CG in the film is bad, all of the CG later in the film
is very fine and very realistic.<br /><br />This is a bad movie. It was poorly written and horribly paced, and
characters were underdeveloped. However, it is a very pretty piece of
eye-candy, the action is phenomenal, there are some genuinely good
jokes, and some of the performances provide unintentional campy laughs.
So they even out the abysmal plot, and elevate the film to a very
watchable status.<br /><br />I give &#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; an average 5 out of 10. It&#x27;s a bad movie, but
it&#x27;s a very fun-to-watch bad movie, and I&#x27;d say you should rent the
Blu-Ray (for the effects) and watch it once or twice with friends and a
lot of popcorn, then forget about it.
