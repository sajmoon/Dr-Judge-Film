&#x22;In brightest day, in blackest night, no evil shall escape my sight&#x85;&#x22;
Unless you&#x27;re a comic-book aficionado, it&#x27;s unlikely that you&#x27;ll be
able to finish the Green Lantern oath off through simple guesswork, but
Martin Campbell&#x27;s film is structured in such way to appeal to both
comic-fans and comic-newbies alike. The cinematic adaptation of the DC
comic-book Green Lantern follows a member of the Green Lantern Corps,
everyman Hal Jordan goes from being a test-pilot, to a universal
peace-keeper, while having to juggle the conventional girl in between.
It is a fun and easy-to-enjoy comic-book movie, neither Campbell nor
Reynolds take the film too seriously and it will no doubt be
appreciated well by children across the globe, but it&#x27;s fun, free
loving spirit can&#x27;t save the film from having an absolutely dire script
an un-even pacing during the second-act which in turn drags the
comic-to-film property from decent fanfare to adequate beginnings.<br /><br />Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) is a first-rate test-pilot who never seems
to be able to live up to not only his own potential, but others
expectations of him as well. Battling the various demons associated
with his past, he coasts through life and his job to the displeasure of
many including his female co-pilot Carol Ferris (Blake Lively), and
that is until the Green Lantern member Abin Sur (Temuera Morrison)
crash-lands on Earth and chooses Hal as his successor. Abin Sur is a
member of an inter-galactic peacekeeping authority called the Green
Lantern Corps, with over 3,600 members, the group promises to protect
all life-forms in the entire universe(s) against evil, and now Hal
Jordan has been chosen as humanity&#x27;s first member. Armed with a ring, a
green lantern, and almost infinite power which is driven through the
strength of its participants will-power, Hal must join the Green
Lantern Corps and prove himself as he battles the parasitic-entity
Parallax which feeds on its opponents fear.<br /><br />Despite obtaining some criticism from writers and critics about &#x27;Green
Lanterns&#x27; lavish and brightly coloured CGI and non-CGI sets, it does
allow the film to set this planet apart from the other worlds in which
other comic-books envision. Oa, where the Green Lantern Corps central
base of operations is situated, is a brightly lit utopia fuelled
through the will-power of thousands. It looks beautiful, as the
computer generated imagery really sets the city a part from other
recently envisioned comic-book realms. While the characters themselves,
Sinestro (Mark Strong), Killerwog (Michael Clarke Duncan) and the
Guardians of the Universe also establish themselves within the comic
book universe with their unique and vibrant appearances, allowing them
to drive the film&#x27;s plot along where needed, but their characters are
incredibly underused, which is most likely a product of the fact that a
&#x27;Green Lantern&#x27; sequel is no doubt being lined up ASAP, but it is also
a big drain on the film&#x27;s impact. While the CGI aliens and action heavy
plot does its part to create a pretty-easy-going-popcorn-flick, the
human characters and the film&#x27;s script do not.<br /><br />Despite &#x27;Green Lanterns&#x27; running time being a mere one hour and
forty-five minutes due to the boring and drawn-out second act of the
film it seems like the film lasts a lot longer in reality. While it is
a Green Lantern/Hal Jordan-centric film, very little time is spent even
trying to intersperse a small amount of characterisation into the human
characters of the piece. Senator Hammond (Tim Robbins), Dr. Waller
(Amanda Bassett) and even the film&#x27;s Earth-trapped antagonist, science
teacher Henry Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard), are barely allowed any time to
present and develop their own motives or thoughts. This isn&#x27;t helped by
the film&#x27;s exceptionally clich&#xE9;d and poorly written script which fails
to not only add further depth to related characters, but it also fails
to provide Reynolds with enough humorous sequences to drive his
comic-book persona. While &#x27;Green Lantern&#x27; does work on some levels, it
also fails on others, and while the film is very easy-going and
enjoyable comic-book adaptation, it is also severely restricted by its
slow-moving, poorly written middle segment which is then undermined
further its frenetic conclusion.
