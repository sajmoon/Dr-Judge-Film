What do you get when you cross &#x22;Star Trek&#x22; with &#x22;Clash of the Titans&#x22;?
You get a silly but fairly enjoyable film. That&#x27;s kind of what &#x22;Green
Lantern&#x22; is. The premise is a bit absurd, but otherwise, it&#x27;s pretty
good stuff.<br /><br />The special effects are both weird and cool. It&#x27;s not what you would
see in more thorough movies like &#x22;Star Trek&#x22; or &#x22;Transformers.&#x22; I think
it was just meant to be eye candy. The makeup, on the other hand, is at
the same level as &#x22;Star Trek.&#x22; The action is rousing and the things
that Hal does with the ring are most creative. And the 3D was fine.<br /><br />The acting is mostly moderate. Ryan Reynolds was okay as the lead role.
The best performance was by Tim Robbins, who handles his strong
character well.<br /><br />The script, though, was dull and obvious. Like when Hal (Green Lantern)
first finds out about the GL ring, Abin Sur, the extraterrestrial who
gives the ring to him, is fatally wounded and dying. Yeah, I really
believe that when he first finds him, Hal is gonna already care enough
about him to cry &#x22;Don&#x27;t do that! You can&#x27;t die!&#x22; <br /><br />It did have a good message, though. Hal is a guy who wants to be
fearless, but he learns that he&#x27;s had the wrong idea of what the word
&#x22;fearless&#x22; means. Fearless is not the absence of fear. But when your
will is good, will is always stronger than fear.<br /><br />&#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; is compelling on some levels and feeble on others. My
fellow critics Michael Medved and Roger Ebert gave it two and a half
stars out of four, and the IMDb average is 6.3/10. So it&#x27;s gotten
mostly reasonable acclamation.<br /><br />6/10 for &#x22;Green Lantern.&#x22; Don&#x27;t take it seriously and have some fun
with it.
