Now here is an interesting bastard mix of The Matrix, Aeon Flux, Avalon
and something Kubrick would have done if he was alive today, twenty
years old and suffering from a serious drug addiction. The story of
Green Lantern sure ain&#x27;t great. I don&#x27;t know if this is a comic
adaptation, but considering all the hyped Marvel crap that&#x27;s been
flooding the market in the past five years, it&#x27;s still okay. You got
humans fighting vampires, and though it&#x27;s called a &#x22;blood war&#x22; it&#x27;s
actually just the last remaining, say, five mutants against the rest of
humanity. Lantern gets caught between lines, protecting a cloned human
child that maybe carries the cure for mutantism.<br /><br />So far, so good, there&#x27;s a lot of action going on and a lot of it is
CGI, some of it good, some of it not. The (virtual) sets all look
pretty messed up, and there are some nice shots here, especially the
objective shots of preparation and aftermath of the (many) fight
scenes. I don&#x27;t know if this movie has a message, if so, it doesn&#x27;t
quite come across, it&#x27;s just a well made action flick with a dumb
story, a lot of cool over-the-top ideas, especially when it comes to
fighting, and okay acting. Compared to its direct competitor, Batman
Begins, it&#x27;s way better.
