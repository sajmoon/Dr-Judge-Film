If someone gave you $300 million dollars and said &#x22;Make me an awesome
movie about the Green Lantern&#x22;, you might think to yourself &#x27;Ah, twice
as much money as Thor and X-Men: First Class had - easy as pie!&#x27;. If
you&#x27;re director Martin Campbell and you&#x27;ve impressed everyone with
movies like Edge of Darkness and Casino Royale, but secretly hate super
hero movies and Hollywood producers with an insane cunning, and really
want to make an expensive pile of fail, you&#x27;d have made &#x22;Green
Lantern&#x22;.<br /><br />The short review - don&#x27;t waste your money on this unless you
*literally* have nothing better to do than watch paint dry. If you like
comic books, or even just action movies, AVOID AT ALL COSTS.<br /><br />Where to begin... I heard bad things about the movie, but I thought
&#x27;How bad could it be?&#x27;.<br /><br />First things first. Ryan Reynolds. Generally known for playing slightly
air-headed characters with a sense of humor and formulaic Hollywood
looks. Star of fifty-two mostly forgettable movies. And this is the
person you cast for a tent-pole blockbuster that is about as comedic as
Schindler&#x27;s List? The Green Lantern&#x27;s romantic interest, Blake Lively
looks good, but can only do so much with the steaming pile of dialog
she&#x27;s been handed. Peter Sarsgaard as the mad scientist
turned-host-to-evil-from-beyond-space! does quite well as a somewhat
sympathetic villain. Save Sarsgaard and Mark Strong to a lesser extent,
it&#x27;s a text book exercise in bad casting of middle-of-the road actors.<br /><br />Second, 150 million for marketing, 150 million for production, that
buys some seriously impressive CGI, right? I mean, all three Lord of
the Rings movies had about 15 million less for their combined budgets
and look at the CGI there. From a tragic airport field at night that
resembles a ray-trace from 1983 to CGI characters with entirely
humanoid features (the Guardians) that aren&#x27;t even *lip-synched* to a
monster with a face that looks like something out of a Saturday morning
children&#x27;s cartoon and is roughly as terrifying, it&#x27;s an amateur effort
all around. Then there&#x27;s the Green Lantern himself - something about
the human head on the CGI body looks off for the entire film, and you
sit in the theater thinking about a floating head attached to a CGI
body rather than an actual character.<br /><br />Third, the dialog, characters and plot belong in a straight-to-DVD
release. Credited writers Greg Berlanti, Michael Green, Marc Guggenheim
and Michael Goldenberg are most known for Dawson&#x27;s Creek, Smallville,
CSI: Miami and Bed of Roses, respectively. With an all-star team of
writers like that... Oh wait. Right. Most of those are awful in terms
of writing. It&#x27;s almost as if someone set out to create an all-star
team of the most clich&#xE9;d and bland writers they could get.<br /><br />Super hero movies are experiencing a golden age - for the first time,
CGI has gotten to the point where comic books can make the transition
to the big screen and be something to actually take seriously and not
just as entertainment for children. And for the most point, in no small
part due to Marvell Studio&#x27;s efforts - they&#x27;ve done so flawlessly. With
a batting average far above Hollywood as a whole, a reputation for
quality in an arena that has historically commanded little respect,
they&#x27;ve succeeded far beyond the initial hopes of fans everywhere.<br /><br />DC, Marvell&#x27;s traditional rival in the comic book world, on the other
hand, is doing their best to sink all of that to the bottom of the
Mariana trench. With such efforts as Smallville and Jonah Hex, they&#x27;re
doing a bang-up job at that. The notable exception being RED, while not
a fantastic movie, it was decidedly entertaining. The rest of their
production credits read like children&#x27;s entertainment. Oh wait, it is!
It all comes together like a perfect storm of fail, with DC at the helm
of the SS Failboat assuring everyone that it will be a wonderful film
as the viewers watch in horror as a giant wave of bad acting,
horrendous plot and shambling dialog prepares to smash the entire ship
to flinders. Even Ang Lee is laughing, because the title of worst
big-budget comic book movie has been snatched from his grateful hands.
If you don&#x27;t see this film, you won&#x27;t have to work to forget it. Save
yourself the trouble and don&#x27;t.
