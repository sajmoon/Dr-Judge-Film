2011_October 15 
I watched this last night on &#x22;pay per view;&#x22; or rather I should say,
stopped watching this, at 30 minutes into it, actually. This is one of
those films where I am in agreement with critics who trashed it. Ryan
Reynolds was &#x22;acting&#x22; (and I use that term very loosely here)as if he
had ingested a few Valium pills. He sleep walked through his scenes,
delivering his lines as if he didn&#x27;t care. There was no sense of
dramatic timing and I found Reynolds&#x27; character&#x27;s transformation into
the Green Lantern to be devoid of any semblance of wonder and fun. I
couldn&#x27;t help but compare his bland discovery of his super powers (i.e.
enhanced strength and the ability to fly) with Toby McGuire&#x27;s acting in
Spiderman, where he discovers his super powers with a mixture of awe,
joy, confusion and even awkwardness. If I am going to watch a badly
made movie, at least let it be something so wretchedly bad that
watching it gives me nasty, visceral pleasure in jeering at its
badness; i.e. something like Battlefield Earth or Show Girls. Green
Lantern, on the other hand, is not one of those &#x22;it&#x27;s so bad, it&#x27;s
good&#x22; in a nasty kind of way films. I can&#x27;t believe this thing grossed
over $200 million at the box office. It just shows the power of mass
marketing, I guess, in our dumbed down, media saturated society.
