This is my first review as i feel a bit let down by some of the other
negative reviews i have read i saw the film yesterday with my daughter
and i have to say i thoroughly enjoyed the film from beginning to end<br /><br />The whole point of going to the cinema is to be ENTERTAINED and that is
exactley what this film delivers it&#x27;s fun fun fun i have never heard of
the green lantern before and i now wish to read the comic books<br /><br />For me everything worked the hero played by Ryan Reynolds was brilliant
he drew me into his character and the supporting cast in particular
Mark Strong were very good and paradox was a fantastic villain and the
special effects were fantastic <br /><br />If you like to be entertained by a good syfy film go and see this and
ignore the negative reviews because i think critics are far far too
critical and miss the point of going to the cinema
