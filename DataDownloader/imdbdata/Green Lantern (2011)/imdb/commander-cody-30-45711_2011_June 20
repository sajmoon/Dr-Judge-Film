OK to start with, i am a big comic fan and Ryan Reynolds is one of my
all time favorite actors. So i thought i would love this film. But it
sucked big time. There was so much wrong with it i just don&#x27;t know
where to start. The CGI in it was not very well done. The bad guys
where awful. The story just dragged on. It felt like it was 4 hours
long and i was even thinking of walking out. I feel done that i payed
to see this. How can they make a movie this bad when X-Men First Class
was well First Class. Please save your money and wait for the DVD. That
way after you have watched it, you can use it as a drinks coaster.<br /><br />.
