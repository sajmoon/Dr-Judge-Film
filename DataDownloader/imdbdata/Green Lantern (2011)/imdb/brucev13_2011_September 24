With all those super heroes movies it was inevitable that The Green
Lantern would get made into a live action movie. After already having
seen an animated movie about the origin of Green Lantern I was
wondering what more they could do with it. And I have to say that while
the movie was good. It didn&#x27;t pack that punch the animated movie did.
Let me make this clear. The movie will satisfy the masses. As the movie
is full of humor,beautiful special effects and lot of action. It is
everything else that is kinda off especially when compared to the
animated version. In there the origin was much better explained.
Still,that is nitpicking on my side. Since I wasn&#x27;t bored one second.
