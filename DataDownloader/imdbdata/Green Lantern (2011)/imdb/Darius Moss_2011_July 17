yeah.. the black version of the green lantern is way cooler.. we need
some diversification in the super hero movie spectrum.. most of the
kids don&#x27;t know that there are many green lanterns.. so the most recent
one (from the justice league cartoons.. who is black) should have been
used in the movie.. pretty sure it woulda sold more.. i think more kids
of this generation would have gone to see it.. the guy who plays the
lantern invthis movie just looks cheesy.. he doesn&#x27;t even look tough..
and then this sets the justice league movie up to be an all white
cast.. which is gonna cause the same poor box office sales that this
movie had because of the green lantern not being black... i guess
theoretically the black green lantern could replace this one.. since
the lanterns are chosen/replaceable...
