Being a comic geek, I was happy when the Green Lantern news was called.
Ryan Reynolds looks like a great choice and Peter Sarsgaad was a good
choice too.<br /><br />The day came and......Boy I was wrong. How can you manage to ruin a
movie based on a comic.(OK Dragon Ball Z and X-Men 3 doesn&#x27;t count).<br /><br />The story is based on the comic but the acting......<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan is bad. Just bad. You don&#x27;t care about him
because Hal Jordan is not like that. Ryan was funny in a movie that
doesn&#x27;t need to be funny. Peter Sarsgaad as Hector Hammond fails badly.
The way that this villain is in the comic is not even close as the
portrayed here. The Best thing of the movie was Mark Strong as
Siniestro. He is a hero/villain in the comic and here they give him
this evil touch.<br /><br />The CGI was push over a lot. Thor worked good with the creation of the
planet and environment but here all looks CGI.
