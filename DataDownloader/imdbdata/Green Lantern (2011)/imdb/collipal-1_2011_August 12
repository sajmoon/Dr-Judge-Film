I had never had too much enthusiasm in the adventures from the
super-hero Green Lantern, until writer Geoff Johns took the reins of
the comic and re-defined its confuse mythology, at the same time he
focused the drama on immediate and tangible human conflicts, instead of
the distorted &#x22;space-opera&#x22; which kept away for decades to the readers
(like me) who were more interested in &#x22;normal&#x22; heroes like Batman or
Spider-Man. Unfortunately, the film Green Lantern takes the most rancid
formulas from the super-hero genre, and the result is a horrible, bland
and tedious film.<br /><br />On some way, Green Lantern achieved what it proposed to itself: it
introduces us the character, it shows us his exotic powers and it
establishes the function from the Green Lantern army as protectors from
the universe. Unfortunately, the screenplay covers all that without any
energy, nor respect to the spirit from the comics, and without the
slightest inkling of suspense, even when the Earth is about to be
destroyed by an extraterrestrial monster. The things just happen as we
expect them to happen; there are not any surprises nor sensation of a
narrative progress. Hal Jordan (the main character) receives the ring.
Hal Jordan visits the Oa planet. Hal Jordan is trained by the best
instructors (during more or less 5 minutes). Hal Jordan saves Carol
Ferris&#x27; life and takes advantage of the opportunity to restart his
romance. Hal Jordan...well, you understand what I am talking about. The
whole movie feels like a succession of scenes without any emotional
connection or dramatic basis. Instead of telling us a story, it simply
shows a series of events. It is like eating the individual ingredients
from a pie, instead of enjoying an already cooked pie.<br /><br />As for the special effects, some ones are laughably bad (like the crash
from a helicopter), but the cosmic landscapes, the visit to Oa and the
manifestations of green energy are the only elements from the film
which make justice to the comic. On the other side of the coin, there
are various moments which are so bad that they are involuntary funny.
For example, the first appearance from the super-hero should have been
epic and impressive; however, it is made with such a clumsiness that I
was uncontrollably laughing.<br /><br />It is easy to note that Ryan Reynolds brought effort to his performance
as Jordan/Green Lantern; pity that his character is so poorly written
that he could not do too much with it. Blake Lively is insipid and not
very credible as the romantic interest. Peter Sarsgaard brings energy
and conviction to his character; on the opposite, Tim Robbins seems to
have appeared in here only in order to charge a paycheck. Mark Strong
shows enough credibility to avoid his character to fall into a living
caricature; his screen-time in the film is very short, even though his
character promises to have more presence in the following film.<br /><br />The one who does not promise any presence or interest in the sequel is
me (sure, assuming the fact that some suicide producer from Hollywood
will have the courage to authorize a sequel after this fiasco). I
already had enough with wasting my money and my time with this hollow,
disastrous and mortally boring film. In summary: stay away from Green
Lantern.
