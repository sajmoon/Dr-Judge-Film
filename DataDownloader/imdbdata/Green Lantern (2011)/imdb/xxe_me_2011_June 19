I saw the movie to night not expecting to much after reading a review
in the papers, when the movie started it was a little hard to
understand since i have never read the comics but as it got more into
the movie i found my self having a good time laughing and quenching my
hands all through the movie.<br /><br />now i saw x-men wolverine origins and when i first watch it i didn&#x27;t
like it that much i found this movie was funnier and better i plan to
watch it a few more times just so i can understand it better and i
might even start reading the comics but over all it was quite good and
i plan to buy it when it comes on to DVD :)
