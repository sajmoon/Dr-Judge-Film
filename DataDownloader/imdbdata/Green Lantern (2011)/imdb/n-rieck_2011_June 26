This movie is the best DC Comic to make it to the big screen (better
than any Superman or Batman). Comparing to Marvel for a moment, it is
at least as good as &#x22;Iron Man&#x22; and better than &#x22;Fantastic Four&#x22; and
&#x22;X-Men&#x22;. Be sure to stay after the first set of credits to see a
surprising extra minute which (I believe) will lead into a sequel.<br /><br />Now I have heard some stories about a few people walking out. That did
not happen in the theatre I attended so I can only assume that those
people probably would also hate the TV show &#x22;The Big Bang Theory&#x22; or
would not ever read a comic book. (I&#x27;m a 58-year old software developer
working for a large Canadian telecommunications company and I still
read comics; although I&#x27;ve never read an issue of &#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; in 40
years, I&#x27;ll bet I would still find it a experience pleasurable)
