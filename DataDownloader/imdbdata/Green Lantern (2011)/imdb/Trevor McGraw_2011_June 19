2011_June 19 
While I am not a DC comic fan, growing up reading Marvel, i was still
interested in this. I am also a fan of Ryan Reynolds, which was what
ultimately convinced me. When i went to watch this, my ultimate
comparison was to X-Men: First Class. They seemed to be complete
opposite: While X-Men had a great story and characters, the effects
lacked greatly for 2011. In Green Lantern, the effects were great, and
convincing, yet the story was too quick, and there was little character
progression outside of Hal. I was able to understand Hal&#x27;s character,
but no one else.<br /><br />The part in here that i really liked, actually distracted from what a
superhero movie should be. It was less about the action, and more about
finding the true power of will to overcome fear. It was more about Hal
finding himself, than becoming a hero, even though of course this is
what lead him to become the hero that he is. The path to finding will
power was perfectly crafted, which helped make up for the weak
characters. And of course, as with most super hero movies nowadays,
there were the comedy bits that were actually funny.<br /><br />In the end, it&#x27;s worth a watch, probably not more than once unless your
a big Green Lantern fan. Go to the theater for the full experience, and
it&#x27;s up to you if you want more of it.
