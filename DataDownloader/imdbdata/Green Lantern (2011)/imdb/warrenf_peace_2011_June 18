What is up with professional movie critics like the dick at the Times
who said Green Lantern was bad? It&#x27;s not bad- on the contrary, it&#x27;s
really, really good - especially for such a cosmic concept. Sure, there
were some script issues, but mostly trivial (unless your expectation is
in the way), but these in no way impeded my enjoyment of this film
adaption of my favorite comic book superhero series from my childhood. <br /><br />The Times tool also said something cynical, like &#x22;.. Are superheroes
relevant in today&#x27;s world..&#x22; or some such tripe, and the fact that he
makes such an insipid comment demands the answer &#x27;YES&#x27;, because in our
cynical world, kids need positive role models (as do their parents),
and Ryan Reynolds does a great job delivering one for us. Especially
the idea about the most powerful force being will - if only we&#x27;d
embrace that - the missing component in today&#x27;s effed up world is in
such idealism offered in this entertaining, visually stunning, cosmic
(and cosmically beautiful), scientifically accurate, and exciting film.
I am certainly looking forward to a sequel, which is implied, so make
it so!<br /><br />Without giving much away, I can say that the film moved a little too
quickly for me, perhaps because some of the visuals were so compelling
that I wanted the camera to linger there (instead, it occasionally
lingered in the wrong spots a few times, for example, in some scenes
that were tangent to the main story), but again, the errors were
forgivable when the end result was so enjoyable. <br /><br />The Green Lantern can manifest anything he can imagine, and my main
criticism would be the writers didn&#x27;t go far enough exploring this -
when one has an infinite blank slate in which to create, it can be a
challenge to find new ideas that folks can relate to - I get that - but
the writers could have, should have spent a bit more time on the aspect
of training ones mind to the discipline of harnessing thoughts. I can
imagine yoga-like mental exercises and let the fun begin! But these can
be explored in a sequel. <br /><br />I hope the box office grows fat enough to convince the idiots in
Hollywood to continue this franchise. I want the idealism and the
valiant heroism of the Green Lanterns to inspire my son more than the
hedonistic Tony Stark (although he can too, a little!). So check it out
- I saw the 3D version, but it should be good in 2D, too. See if you
can imagine a universe that looks out for the &#x27;rest of us&#x27;, where the
good guys win, and superheroes exist. That&#x27;s a place where I want to
live!
