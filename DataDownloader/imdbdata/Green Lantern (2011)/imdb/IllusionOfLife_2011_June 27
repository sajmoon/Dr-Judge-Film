Green Lantern rides that fine line between just good enough to call it
decent and bad. On one hand it sets up the characters really well and
lays the ground work for what could be a really great movie, but on the
other hand the story goes off in too many different directions and
doesn&#x27;t allow enough time to give any of them a proper telling. It
feels all at once reluctant to show you too much of Oa and the Green
Lantern Corps lest your average non-nerd movie goer get confused, but
at the same time asks you to accept a bizarre non-traditional villain
without a lot of clear set up or focus. <br /><br />There are a lot of things to like about Green Lantern; there&#x27;s some
good action, cool set pieces, and Ryan Reynolds does a wonderful job as
Hal Jordan, but there are just as many, if not more, issues with the
movie that hold it back from being good. The biggest of these issues is
a story that doesn&#x27;t feel coherent or intuitive. You can almost see
each of the film&#x27;s four writers fighting for their personal favorite
character to have screen time in the film at the expense of a
consistent story. <br /><br />Green Lantern can essentially be summed up as wasted potential. There&#x27;s
enough good elements in this that I hope they continue the series
rather than starting over from the ground up with a reboot, however, if
this series is going to succeed in the same genre as The Dark Knight,
Iron Man, Spider-Man 2, and The Incredibles; Green Lantern 2 really
needs to step up its game and take this series to its full potential. <br /><br />Rating: C-
