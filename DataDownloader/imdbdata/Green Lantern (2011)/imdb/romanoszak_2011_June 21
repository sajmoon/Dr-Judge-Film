All this years we have the chance to see our beloved Marvel heroes on
the big screen and they were very good-most of them. But DC once again
proves they have something great in their sleeves too. First Nolan&#x27;s
Batman and now..Green Lantern!!!<br /><br />Lets get the obvious stuff out of the way...the CGI is incredible!
Trust me, it is, despite what some people used to say. But besides
that, the filmmakers did a pretty good job with the huge mythology of
Green Lantern. I mean, in the movie we get everything we need to now-at
least for an origin story. We learn about the Guardians, our favorite
Lanterns, Kilowog, Tomar-Re, Abin Sur and of course Sinestro, the
energy of will, and the energy of fear, Krona/Parallax&#x27;s story and
Hector Hammond. <br /><br />The casting is excellent! Ryan Reynolds does a real fine job portraying
Hal Jordan/Green Lantern, he is serious when he needs to and cocky of
funny when he also needs to, although he is not as good as Christian
Bale was in &#x27;&#x27;Batman Begins&#x27;&#x27;. Blake Lively is also good and sexy as
Carol-Hal&#x27;s love interest- and she has a good chemistry with Ryan.
Peter Sarsgaard is creepy and weird but hey, that&#x27;s what Hammond is,
even before his transformation begins and provides a quite memorable
villain. And finally, Mark Strong is without question the best one in
this movie. He IS Sinestro! I was very impressed not only by his
make-up but also his performance. Bravo Mark!!<br /><br />The story is good, but after Hal&#x27;s second visit on Oa it felt a bit
rush and the action scenes are longer than Thor&#x27;s but shorter that I
would &#x27;ve expected-they are intense nonetheless. That&#x27;s the only weak
part of the movie for me, it&#x27;s too short and sometimes I got the
feeling that the filmmakers were cutting out parts that they had to be
in there.<br /><br />So to sum it up, Green Lantern is a very entertaining film, go check it
out despite what some people claim that it is crap-it&#x27;s not! It has
great potentials it could become a great franchise...please Warner
Brothers don&#x27;t f@&#x26;%k this up! A sequel must be made....We are waiting!
