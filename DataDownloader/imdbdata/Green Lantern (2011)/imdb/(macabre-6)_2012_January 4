2012_January 4 
I was really looking forward to this, I am a huge DC fan, and I was so
excited to see another big budget movie starring someone other than
Batman and Superman, and it ended up being the most disappointing movie
experience of 2011, that doesn&#x27;t mean the movie was bad, I&#x27;m just
saying I had hoped this movie would be amazing, and it was merely
&#x22;good&#x22;, and barely that. Here&#x27;s a chance to expand and use other DC
heroes who haven&#x27;t received the big screen treatment yet, and what do
you know? It under-performs and now may have hurt other DC movie
projects. I think I should clarify that &#x22;most disappointing movie
experience of 2011&#x22; is not the same as being the worst, I mean, it&#x27;s
not like I had expectations for Transformers: Dark of the Moon, and yet
that movie was even worse than I feared, but back to Green Lantern,
what worked? All of the Green Lantern stuff is actually pretty cool,
it&#x27;s just that it isn&#x27;t enough of it. Peter Sarsgaard is really good,
he seems to be having a lot of fun in his role as Hector Hammond, he is
not scary or threatening, he&#x27;s more of a &#x22;fun&#x22; villain. Mark Strong is
perfectly cast as Sinestro, they could not have found anyone better to
portray that character. Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively both do fine
jobs, nothing really outstanding, but they deliver. The final battle
with Parallax is awesome, too bad it only lasts a couple of minutes.
That&#x27;s a big problem, not enough action, and the choice of villains, I
mean, Sarsgaard does a fine job, but Hector Hammond is simply not that
great of a villain, Parallax is however a fantastic villain, but not in
this movie, the design here is not the best, it&#x27;s just a demonic face
in a cloud, I&#x27;ve seen much better Parallax designs than this one they
ultimately went with. The movie is enjoyable entertainment, but nothing
more, it lacks memorable villains and there aren&#x27;t any impressive big
set-piece moments, save for the ending, it&#x27;s not a bad movie, but I had
hoped it would be so much better. I hope there will be a sequel, but I
doubt there will be.
