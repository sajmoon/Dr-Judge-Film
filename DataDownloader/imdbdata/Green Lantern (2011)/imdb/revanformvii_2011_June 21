I just have to do it, I just have to correct all the haters out
there...<br /><br />No summary, no spoilers, just points on what makes a movie.<br /><br />Storyline: 8/10 Was it award winning? No, but what super hero movie is?
The becoming a Green Lantern of Hal Jordan follows the original comics
perfectly. If you know the comics, you know the beginning. If you never
read them, then you learn a lot real fast. The story introduces only
characters necessary to the plot and nothing more. Hal, Carol,
Senestro, Parallax, the Guardians, Abin Sur, Tomar-Re, and Kilowog.
They easily could have introduced way too many guardians, way too fast,
but they didn&#x27;t. Parallax&#x27;s origins are changed a little but it works
out for the better, remember not everything that works in a book works
on screen. All in all, storyline was good, it kept a good pace. Always
remember it is an origins story so the 2 hours isn&#x27;t completely filled
with action but neither Casee nor I got bored.<br /><br />Acting: 8/10 No Ryan R. did not screw up Hal Jordan. Alright, I&#x27;ll
admit Hal may not be as witty as Ryan played him but Hal was sure as
hell a smart ace in the comics. I thought it fit. I went in thinking,
&#x22;This is going to be great, or really going to suck.&#x22; Luckily, casting
was very well done. Carol: Blake did a fine job. I do agree with
another review that said they wished someone a little more
intellectual/mature would play Carol, but in the long scheme of things,
Blake didn&#x27;t get a terrible amount of screen time to prove herself.
Maybe as Star Sapphire she may pull out. Lantern Corp: Sinestro 10/10
Tomar-Re: 10/10 Kilowog: 10/10 Abin Sur: 10/10 I can&#x27;t say much else
besides that these characters lived up to the comics perfectly. I loved
them all.<br /><br />Graphics/CGI: 8/10 Why 8? Eh, there were a few, just a few I tell you,
parts where the graphics pulled the cartoon look of Spiderman 3.
PLEASE! don&#x27;t be afraid by this, all in all the graphics were awesome.
Oa was beautiful, just a couple notches below Asgard in Thor. Green
Lantern Ring effects were great, all around solid.<br /><br />Costumes/sets: 9/10 First, short and sweet. Live action sets: average.
Skylines just like any other city, Ferris Airforce Base: good enough.
Nothing spectacular but it wasn&#x27;t the center of the movie. Costumes:
STOP HATING ON THE CGI COSTUMES!!!!!!! Even the the comics the suits
were made from energy and that is what the movie did. A powerful ring
of willpower isn&#x27;t going to POOF put anyone in spandex or rubber armor.
The mask appears when the identity of a Lantern needs to be protected
and eye color changes as well. PERFECT to me.<br /><br />Length: 7/10 Although, as I said before there were a few slow parts, I
would have liked to see the movie for a few minutes longer. Towards the
end, yes, a little rushed but it didn&#x27;t ruin the whole movie. 10-15
minutes longer to put it just at the 2 hour mark would have been
perfect for an origins story to me. Took off a couple points here.<br /><br />Overall: 8/10 By all means it is not as bad as Catwoman or Daredevil as
some are writing. Those who make that comment are probably the ones who
think Transformers is somehow an epic movie. Anyways, it is a good
solid super hero movie. Maybe, not one of the greats like Batman
Begins, Dark Knight, and Thor, but still a great movie that wouldn&#x27;t be
bad to take the mature enough younger kids. Parallax is a little scary
and there are a few curse words, but by all means, this is not a racy
film.<br /><br />Remember: Stay after the credits...
