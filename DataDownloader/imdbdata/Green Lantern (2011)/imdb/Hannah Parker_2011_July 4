Okay, first of all: I&#x27;ve never even heard of Green Lantern before this
movie, so I may not have a good comparison of what it should be. I will
give my opinion on the movie however. Not the best movie in the world,
but it isn&#x27;t the worst either. thought that Ryan Reynolds and Blake
Lively were cute together, and like any other super hero film, it&#x27;s
going to be predictable! To be honest not a lot of action happened and
it wasn&#x27;t all that &#x27;thrilling.&#x27; If that&#x27;s what you wanted your better
off will some other super hero. That being said, the plot wasn&#x27;t bad,
good graphics, and I would watch it again. Blake Lively is better off
in Gossip Girl, I don&#x27;t think she can pass as someone being overly
smart like her character Carol is. I like her and all, but I think she
could have put more effort into the role. Ryan Reynolds seemed to enjoy
the film, I sort of get that vibe from all of his work, and I think he
proved himself capbable of being a Green Lantern.
