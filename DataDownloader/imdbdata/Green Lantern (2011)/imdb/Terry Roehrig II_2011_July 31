2011_July 31 
I think I&#x27;ve made it pretty clear on this website by now that I&#x27;m not
really a fan of action movies and/or superhero comic book movies. It&#x27;s
not that I don&#x27;t like them, it&#x27;s the fact that I don&#x27;t prefer them. I&#x27;d
much rather go see a comedy, horror or thriller movie in the movie
theater before I go see action and/or a superhero movie. By the time
they come to DVD, my interest has long since passed and I usually wind
up not seeing it at all. It&#x27;s why I haven&#x27;t seen Iron Man or Iron Man 2
as of yet. However, since my website&#x27;s launch, I can see my tastes
starting to differ just a wee bit... how else do you explain me going
to the theater to see Green Lantern? Hal Jordan (Reynolds) is almost
identical to every other character that Ryan Reynolds has played in the
past. He&#x27;s arrogant, cocky yet still lovable and charming. After having
practically one of the worst days at work ever, he is chosen to become
one of the galaxy&#x27;s guardians, in other words... a Green Lantern. We
zip back and forth between the Green Lantern Corps and Earth as Hal
learns how to be a guardian and just what it means exactly. While Hal
is training away, however, the alien that crash landed on Earth gets
picked up by the government. A mousy scientist, Hector Hammond
(Sarsgaard), is brought in to evaluate the specimen, but gets infected
in the process and becomes one big, bad evil nerd. From there, Hal toys
with the idea that he&#x27;s not cut out for the Corps, woos his longtime
sweetheart, Carol (Lively) and pals around with his buddy, Tom
(Waititi).<br /><br />I understand that every comic book superhero movie has to set it&#x27;s
origins right off the bat, I get that. I didn&#x27;t mind the back story
here at all. In fact, I found it to be better than the actual movie
itself. Not that the movie isn&#x27;t good, it&#x27;s just that the back story
had more action in it. Once we get to Earth and Hal has the ring and
knows what he&#x27;s supposed to be doing... he don&#x27;t do much. Sure, he
saves a bunch of people from being squished by a helicopter by making
the World&#x27;s Largest Hot Wheels Track, but other than that, Earth
doesn&#x27;t know who the hell Green Lantern is, for all they know it was
him who caused the helicopter to go haywire. And I know that the origin
story took a lot of screen time away for them to put Hal on Earth and
to explain him to us, I just wish it was orchestrated better.<br /><br />A lot of stuff works in Green Lantern, though. The acting, the effects,
the humor -- all pluses. Some of the writers of the comic book were
brought in to work on the screenplay... and it shows. You would think
that this would be a good thing, but in this case, no. There were at
least three scenes in the film where I could see Green Lantern as a
comic, complete with dialog bubbles... and each one of them has their
own colorful box (a comic book panel) and one of the main characters in
the center of said panel and all they said was, &#x22;RUN!&#x22; Maybe it&#x27;s
effective in the comic book world (I don&#x27;t read them myself), but on
screen it needs to be more visual and more frantic.<br /><br />I still enjoyed the movie (mainly in part because of Reynolds) and
maybe if they do a sequel, we&#x27;ll get to see Hal Jordan in a bit more
action. Don&#x27;t worry, there&#x27;s another scene in Green Lantern where Hal
does battle evil (the end sequence), it just seems like he did a lot of
sitting around waiting for evil instead of going in search of it. Let&#x27;s
just hope we don&#x27;t have to sit through another origin story like
they&#x27;re doing with Superman: Man of Steel and The Amazing Spider-Man.<br /><br />More reviews at www.soveryterry.com Final Grade: B-
