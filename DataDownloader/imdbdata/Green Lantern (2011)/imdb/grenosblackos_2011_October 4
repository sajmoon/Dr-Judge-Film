I saw this movie yesterday, and i&#x27;ll admit i expected more, but what
CAN you expect from a superhero movie?. The special effects were great,
but where one of the reasons why it flopped.300 million for a budget is
just too much. Also, for once the girl actually noticed who green
lantern&#x27;s secret identity was, not like other superhero movies. Owa was
great, Peter skasgaard was good, and scary, John hurt was
mind-blowingly good as always, as for Ryan Reynolds, he doesn&#x27;t make a
bad GL. Sorry, this is a short review, and my first, so sorry. But
since this IMDb restriction of 10 lines is just annoying, i will
continue. Martin Campbell good have done a better job on this, for
sure,(look at casino Royal and this, and i think you will get my
point), but i think he did just fine. Oh, the plot was better than the
average GL comic (i read some really awful ones). 10 lines yet? I guess
not...
