Now let me begin by saying this film is not an amazing film. It is
definitely not an awful film, like most critics are saying. I think
critics might have raised their expectations due to Thor and X-Men:
First Class. They should not compare the Green Lantern with those
films. It is ranked now 24% on Rotten Tomatoes, which is way too low.
It would probably be in the high 60s, if it was released before Thor
and X-Men: First Class.<br /><br />The acting in the film is good and not terrible at all. Ryan Reynolds
is great as Hal Jordan and extremely likable. He definitely fits the
role as Hal Jordan really well. Blake Lively is great and extremely
sexy, she&#x27;s not just a pretty face as most are suggesting. Peter
Sarsgaard is a great actor and he plays the villainous Hector Hemmond
really well and interesting. Overall everyone tries their best and at
the end of the day do a really great job, certainly no Oscar worthy
performances, though.<br /><br />The special effects are pretty superb and extremely worthwhile to say
the least. Although it sometimes feel a little CGIish, but it doesn&#x27;t
get too big of a distraction. I have to say I was a little disappointed
how Parallax looked like, it felt a little fake at times, but it is not
horrible in any sense of the way. Also the film did not take itself
seriously which is kind of refreshing. Which could be the reason why
critics disliked it so much. They want another sad, personal and
serious story. Unlike Thor and X-Men, The Green Lantern is more kids
friendly.<br /><br />The main problem of the film was that they were trying to cram stuff in
from the comics and the personal lives of the other characters. It
seems that there could be so many sequels for the other characters. It
did kind of focus on too many characters. Also the editing gets to be a
little distracting at times, they certainly needed to have done a
better job, but the editing is mediocre at best.<br /><br />Overall the Green Lantern was a fun summer flick. Although it is
nowhere near the realm of The Dark Knight, it didn&#x27;t need to be. The 3D
was actually really good and the special effects were memorable. No
doubt, the critics were extremely tough on the Green Lantern and it is
unfair. At the end of the day, don&#x27;t listen to the critics. Make up
your mind and see this film. At the end of the day, it should be only
your opinion that matters to you. You might agree with the critics or
you might not. However don&#x27;t skip this movie because of the low Rotten
Tomatoes score.
