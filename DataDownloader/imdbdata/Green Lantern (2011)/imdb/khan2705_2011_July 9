In a universe as vast as it is mysterious, a small but powerful force
has existed for centuries. Protectors of peace and justice, they are
called the Green Lantern Corps. A brotherhood of warriors sworn to keep
intergalactic order, each Green Lantern wears a ring that grants him
superpowers. But when a new enemy called Parallax threatens to destroy
the balance of power in the Universe, their fate and the fate of Earth
lie in the hands of their newest recruit, the first human ever
selected: Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds). Hal is a gifted and cocky test
pilot, but the Green Lanterns have little respect for humans, who have
never harnessed the infinite powers of the ring before.<br /><br />oh man! it was exactly as i thought it would be. from the trailers it
looked like a very bad movie. even the Special effects didn&#x27;t impressed
me and then i saw the reviews and they were terrible. but i still
wanted to see it for the obvious reasons.<br /><br />to be honest this movie looked like very cartoon-ish to me, it was like
some Original Cartoon Network movie of the Ben 10 or something. it was
so badly made and just looked like a B movie. this is one of the bad
superhero/ summer blockbuster movies of the past. but seriously, there
are worse superhero movies than this one. Critics are very harsh on
this movie and i can understand why? but the are a bit too harsh.<br /><br />this movie had so much silly parts, corny jokes, shaky plot, bad
screenplay, bad comic book adaption in general, bad special effects,
some good action fighting moments. trust me it is no Batman, Iron Man
or Superman. i feel bad for this Superhero, they didn&#x27;t do good justice
with him. for the sequel they should get a different team. it already
was a lesser known hero and now people will hate him thanks to this
movie.<br /><br />Director Martin Campbell directed the best Bond movie Casino Royale and
the other good one Golden Eye alongwith a well reviewed The Mask of
Zorro. his other movies were bad, like Vertical Limit, Beyond Borders,
The Legend of Zorro and Edge of Darkness. he directed this movie with i
don&#x27;t know what vision, i hated this movie for being a bad movie. he
should not direct 2nd movie. he wasn&#x27;t good as a director. Screenplay
was badly written too, too much weak moments. plot was again shaky and
very uneven. story was nice but too much clich&#xE9;. badly written.<br /><br />oh and the visual effects weren&#x27;t that good. i hated them literally.
some nice action and fights but not much and that is its problem. there
isn&#x27;t much in the movie. movie is weak and not strong. Ryan Reynolds
gave a wooden and unlikable performance and he was hard to imagine as a
superhero. miscast. Blake Lively was good in it, i liked her. she at
least tried to give some output which was really nice. other actors
were Peter Sarsgard as villain was awesome. Mark Strong and Tim Robbins
could have been better. and other actors were okay.<br /><br />this movie was badly edited as well. many bad moments with less good. i
was bored for many time throughout the movie. it may give you a bit of
nice time or popcorn entertainment but this movie is a badly made movie
that disappoints a lot.
