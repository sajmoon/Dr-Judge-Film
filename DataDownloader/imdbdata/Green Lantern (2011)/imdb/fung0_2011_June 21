After hearing all the moaning about Green Lantern, I expected to see a
mediocre mess. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. This is a very good
adaptation, and a really entertaining film.<br /><br />The acting is just about spot-on, with actors perfectly matched to
their characters. The story holds few surprises, but it&#x27;s told well,
with Hal Jordan&#x27;s internal struggle against fear offering just enough
counterpoint to the action sequences. I&#x27;m sure some viewers will find
it too slow, while others will feel it was rushed. But it works, if you
let it. My one disappointment was that Gil Kane and John Broome (never
mind Nodell and Finger) get no screen credit. This film is as much
their work as anyone&#x27;s.<br /><br />Overall, as comic-book adaptations go, I&#x27;d put Green Lantern just a bit
ahead of Thor (and I liked Thor a lot). But of course, if you really
want to scoff, you probably will.
