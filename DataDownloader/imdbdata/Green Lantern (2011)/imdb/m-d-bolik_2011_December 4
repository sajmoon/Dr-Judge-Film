I didn&#x27;t go to see this when it was released because some reviews were
so negative. So I have just watched it on DVD. It was actually a very
good film - and I thought it was well paced and enjoyable to watch. Of
course there are flaws - but it was better than recent DC superhero
outings, such as Bryan Singer&#x27;s Superman or even the Dark Knight. I
have to say, as a youngster, I was always more interested in DC comics
than Marvel ones. And I have always felt that the Green Lantern would
lend itself well to the big screen. This was really a very good film
and unfairly criticised. As I mentioned there are flaws but these can
be forgiven because of the movie&#x27;s spirit - and also, as some have
already mentioned - because it doesn&#x27;t take itself as seriously as
other superhero flicks.<br /><br />So - ultimately - we trust the major reviewers - but it seems they can
get it wrong. And now I am sorry I didn&#x27;t see this in a movie theatre.
