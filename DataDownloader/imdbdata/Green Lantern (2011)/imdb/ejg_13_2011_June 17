Let me say this, Green Lantern is the first movie of a series. That
being said they introduced everyone and got a good story with it. They
introduced the core, the villains, and his family and friends plus I
think they added a little teaser as well, but I may have been mistaken.
thought the acting was done well and the visual affects were fun. I
wish they would have done more fight scenes but what was done was very
enjoyable. Introducing of Kilowog, John Stewart, Tomar-Re, and of
course Sinestro make future movies a high chance of happening. I never
thought Ryan Reynolds would have made a good Hal Jordan but he pulls it
off very well, adding his own flair to it makes the old stuff shirt Hal
Jordan that I remember reading makes him a lot more likable. Blake
Lively doesn&#x27;t add anything but she also doesn&#x27;t take anything away
from the performance. Now Mark Strong&#x27;s performance was very well the
look in his eyes makes me believe that he may turn one day, I can&#x27;t
wait to see that. I would put this in my top 10 comic book movies but
be prepared for a sequel.
