With critically acclaimed, Green Lantern centered events like &#x22;Blackest
Night&#x22; rocking the comic book world, expectations were sky high
concerning the live action movie adaptation. It could have been the one
non-Batman DC movie to be a major hit and the launch of a multi billion
dollar franchise that would eventually lead to a much anticipated
&#x22;Justice League&#x22; film. Perhaps the comics did too good a job of
elevating the Green Lantern tale to epic proportions. For compared to
that, and even compared to your standard superhero blockbuster, the
live action adaptation of DC&#x27;s favorite Emerald space man is an utter
mess.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds effortlessly slips into the role of Hal Jordan, a hot
headed, daredevil test pilot with a witty mouth. Other than the fact
that he crashed a plan and was almost fired from his job, he seems to
have a pretty good life judging by his hot girlfriend in bed and his
expensive looking sports car. In another part of the galaxy, an ancient
evil named after a visual displacement error (Parallax) escapes from
imprisonment and seeks revenge upon the intergalactic peacekeeping
force known as the Green Lantern corp. One member, Abin Sur, survives
the initial attack and crashes on earth. Near death, he bids his power
ring to seek a successor who is supposed to be able &#x22;to overcome any
fear&#x22;. That successor so happens to be Hal Jordan. Like any good
wannabe superhero, Hal goes from disbelief to confusion, to rejection
of his heroic calling and then to acceptance and embracing of his duty
as quickly as he is spirited off to the alien world of Oa, then back to
earth, space, then earth again.<br /><br />The first mistake Green Lantern makes is that it feels like two
different stories pasted together. On one hand you have the set up for
this galactic scale conflict between an alien peacekeeping legion and
an immensely powerful cosmic entity. On the other hand, you have a run
of the mill earth based superhero origin tale complete with tacked on
cheesy romance subplot, underdeveloped villain and too much dialogue.
The producers chose to go with the latter since recent superhero movies
that were comparatively more grounded in reality, such as Iron Man or
Dark knight, did better than their less realistic counterparts. But any
fan of the comics would tell you that Green Lantern is anything BUT
down to earth; the galaxy spanning adventure is what sets it apart from
most other superhero stories. The producers failed to realise that.<br /><br />Then in perhaps the biggest misstep short of giving a romantic
Victorian drama film to Michael Bay, they decided to have Martin
Campbell be the director. Campbell&#x27;s resume includes only spy thrillers
like Goldeneye and realistic adventures like Zorro shot on physical
sets; hardly the kind of guy you would want directing a visual effects
laden, green screen shot space epic. Much less so a space epic written
by FOUR different writers. Too many chefs spoil the broth. Thanks to
this, the movie cannot seem to decide what it wants to be. It embraces
the out-of-this-world, comic book look of the aliens and the CGI sets
but never the comic book &#x22;feel&#x22;. Sadly, some of the special effects are
painfully erratic with CGI scenes alternating between awesome and
obviously cartoony. Thankfully the Hans Zimmer inspired score by James
Newton Howard delivers space age electronic tunes with a militaristic
beat which complement the sci/fi action perfectly. However, everything
seems to screech to a standstill during the more conversation heavy or
romantic scenes, even the music stops.<br /><br />The pacing of the whole thing feels like a race car in a city road. The
moment you hit a good adrenaline pumping speed, you got to pull over at
the next red light. At least Ryan Reynold&#x27;s enthusiasm and timely humor
saves the conversations from being completely boring. Many scenes seem
to be an intended homage to previous superhero movies. Hal invoking
catch phrases like &#x22;by the power of Greyskull&#x22; to reacharge his power
ring seems to be a reference to that scene in Spiderman where Peter
Parker was learning to shoot web. There is even a very clever homage to
the balcony scene in the old Christopher Reeve Superman movie but with
a humorous twist. The writing however makes the Hal Jordan character
likable, but not easy to relate to despite Reynold&#x27;s stellar
performance. Same goes for the other characters like Sinestro, Hector
Hammond and even Hal&#x27;s love interest Carol. There is a certain sense of
disconnection between the characters and the audience relating to them.<br /><br />Green Lantern is no doubt entertaining as a mediocre summer
blockbuster, but serves as a bad case of the right movie given to the
wrong people to do. It does the comic books little justice by providing
only a cosmetic resemblance but few of the intrinsic elements that made
them such a hit in recent years. This film is more intent on following
pre-established trends than blazing new ones. Instead of getting &#x22;Star
Trek with superpowers&#x22; we get a poor man&#x27;s Iron Man with green energy
suit instead of armor. What could have been a shining beacon among
comic book blockbusters is instead reduced to just another lamp that
flickers in the face of sky high expectations caused by over publicity
and the critical acclaim the comics have been getting.<br /><br />So much for the power of Green Lantern&#x27;s light.<br /><br />6.5/10 round it up to 7
