As comic-genre film, this is surprisingly solid. It is well-acted and
has good character development. I found this film to be more
entertaining and less predictable than this years crop from Marvel,
although I did enjoy the blonde God of Thunder. Ye other critics need
not to forget this is still based on a comic lest ye be too critical.
It will be interesting to see if the proposed sequel will make it to
production. If so, they better find someone who can create a stronger
script, like Paul Haggis. The latest caped crusader films took comic-
based films to the next level, where Chris Columbus delivered 9 to10
star films.
