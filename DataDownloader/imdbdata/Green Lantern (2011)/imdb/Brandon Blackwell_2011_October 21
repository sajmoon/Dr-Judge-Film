A test pilot is granted a mystical green ring that bestows him with
otherworldly powers, as well as membership into an intergalactic
squadron tasked with keeping peace within the universe.<br /><br />Another wanna-be. I laugh at the people who say that the critics are
way too hard, the film is too clich&#xE9;d and way too cheesy. In about the
middle, the film turned into one of those background movies where I
failed to pay attention and continued to do other things. Don&#x27;t get me
wrong here, the film has potential and at some scenes maybe possibly it
could&#x27;ve been better; but overall, it totally fails. I&#x27;m not a comic
book reader, nor do I find any interest in them but the film (again)
seemed to have potential to become an average superhero flick but it
just becomes a fail. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much I do say. Ryan Reynolds as
a superhero? That just ruins it there. But again, if you overlook the
entire movie, you can see that it could&#x27;ve been different. All in all,
it depends on your taste. If you enjoy crappy, mindless superhero
flicks; this is it. If you enjoy story, pacing, and actually good; this
it not your thing. The pros: the special effects were nice and the
subliminal potential. The cons: well just about everything else. 5/10.
