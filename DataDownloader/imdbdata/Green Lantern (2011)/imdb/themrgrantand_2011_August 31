Firstly this is one weird up film.Why? Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds)is not
hardly bothered by anything,be that arriving in the green lantern corps
or just being transported by a big green orb.Secondly Peter Sarsgaard
seems rather unwanted and doesn&#x27;t really have much to make an impact on
the film.Thirdly Blake lively seems to pretty and spoilt to play a
loving mature pilot.And finally just because Angela Bassett is a doctor
in a superhero movie why does she need a weird futuristic hair cut?
Saying all that i did like the effects,Mark Strongs character and carol
ferris picking up on just because he has a mask which covers his cheek
bones doesn&#x27;t mean it will hide his identity.But this film is to corny
and Ryan Reynolds doesn&#x27;t bring anything to the character to make me
feel that he should be &#x22;the so called chosen one&#x22; Overall a few good
bits but for most of it your thinking what? peace out 5/10
