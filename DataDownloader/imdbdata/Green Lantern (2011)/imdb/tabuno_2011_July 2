Unlike Tom Cruise in Top Gun (1986), Ryan Reynolds&#x27; character is
presented as a genuine human being that isn&#x27;t scripted over the top,
melodramatic two-dimensional character. Even though Hal Jordan
(Reynolds) is the masculine over the top narcissist, this character
maintains a delicate much more complex and even somewhat underplayed
character making the star attraction even more acceptable and
believable. Unlike Batman movies, unlike almost every other superhero,
Hal is authentic in his nature. Even Peter Skarsgaard as Hector Hammond
is the movie&#x27;s nemesis is given a believable character development
unlike those found in Spiderman (2002) and Willem Dafoe&#x27;s Norman
Osborn. The fantastic otherworldly set designs are superior in their
innovative vision that sets it apart from Avatar (2009), Star Wars: The
Phantom Menace (1999). What is accomplished is that Ryan Reynold&#x27;s
humor originates from not comedic nature, but just from the more
difficult nature of events and circumstances and retaining the
character that he is making this movie even more balanced and mature.
There are great emotive subplots going on here that aren&#x27;t exploited
and there is an immediate harshness unlike Spiderman that aren&#x27;t
unwieldy or saccharin. Only three technical, but small weaknesses
earlier in the movie became apparent, the unnecessary Star Gate (1994)
motiff, the reverse alien leg design from The Arrival (1996), and the
incongruity of Reynold&#x27;s character receiving universal knowledge but
still having to ask questions. Overall, this is a great fusion of less
known superhero but as such it brings with it a potent and serious
punch to this genre.
