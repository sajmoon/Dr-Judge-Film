Beware of this botch., 1 They couldn&#x27;t have done it worse even if they
would have desired it.<br /><br />The main actor reminds me at a little boy which is still green behind
his ears. (German proverb).<br /><br />They could have done a lot more out of this one. A better example for
&#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; is the animation movie. Especially &#x22;Sinestro&#x22; plays
there a much more interesting role. This movie is just too
straightforward. No surprising turnarounds in the plot, nothing like
that. Just the mandatory mean less romance, some action and that&#x27;s it.<br /><br />And if I consider, that I was a fan of the green lantern, as young boy,
I am even more disappointed.
