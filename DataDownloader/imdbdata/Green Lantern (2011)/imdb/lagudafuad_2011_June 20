In brightest day, in blackest night,<br /><br />Horrible movies like this<br /><br />Shall escape my sight<br /><br />First I will like to say this movie is nonsense, not well scripted and
sometimes dull, the comic relive scenes lacked the relive it is suppose
to offer, and the intrigue was drowned in the dialogue. Let&#x27;s not even
go to the screenplay which looked like a whole mumbo jumbo of clich&#xE9;s
stolen from the super hero movies we love and all mysteriously rolled
in to one, and what do we get from this Martin Campbell (the director)
latest a bunch of crap.<br /><br />A super villain, which looked like a puff of smoke (a large puff if I
may add) was suppose to bring the end of the world, but Hal took care
of it. Making the villain my top worse villain ever. DC has been
struggling with hero movies, they have Batman and Superman locked down
no doubt but after that, this was supposed to be the next best thing,
but ended up turning out to be the worse. I think the director confused
recklessness and showing lack of safety with lack of fear which Hal
Jordan is known for.<br /><br />The movie had a promising start until like after the first 5 minutes,
where we see a dying green lantern elect a new one Hal, he gives him
the ring and we get to see Hal produce things conjuring them from his
mind e.g giant hammers, machine guns, race cars. The character Hal, is
a Test Pilot with serious Daddy issues, well dead daddy issues. Well
let me say after the huge budget penned down for this intended
masterpiece, you will expect hey 200 million worth of good looking
aliens not Star Trek rejects.<br /><br />We see Hal flying around and I ask myself, why have I been waiting
anxiously to see this movie?
