Not hard to figure out that this movie probably took a bath at the box
office. Poor story line and the expected stupidity from an &#x22;average
Joe&#x22; finding out he has super powers. I know its all based off of a
comic book superhero, but I found this movie to be too &#x22;cartoony&#x22;.
Which is very unfortunate, considering they could have really knocked
it out of the park. And at the end...they left it open for a sequel
with how Synestro came to be....Sorry guys, I highly doubt there will
be a sequel. I seriously question whether this movie even made enough
money to cover the cost of the actors in it. Clearly, anyone that
watches this movie will be able to tell that the actors in it have been
out of work for some time. My advice to Ryan Reynolds...if they do make
a sequel...pass on the part. This part made him look like a goof!
