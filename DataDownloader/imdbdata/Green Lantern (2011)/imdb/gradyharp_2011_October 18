GREEN LANTERN is a spectacle to watch - much technicolored etherized
air, visits to other planets, transformations of aliens into humanoid
forms and vice versa, lots of derring-do on part of the newly hewn
superhero, etc such as in all of these comic book turned films that are
so popular - but at its core is a rather sensitive story that for this
viewer redeems it. It is a tale of how to overcome fear and to believe
in dreams in order to make life in this world livable that for the
audience of youngsters for whom these comic books were created presents
a challenge and a possibility. It also brings some insight into the
topic of filial competition and the role that parents play in fostering
this unfortunate sense of worth. Is it a great film or a revelation of
philosophy? No, but it does entertain on a different level than most
other movies of this nature and that is in large part to the fine
performances of a cast that takes the film seriously - in a good way.<br /><br />A really fine synopsis of the story is here: &#x27;A cocky test pilot, Hal
Jordan, acquires superhuman powers when he is chosen by &#x22;the Ring&#x22;, the
willpower-fed source of power, of the Green Lantern Intergalactic
Corps. He, reluctantly at first, takes on the challenges these
superheroes face. Putting his self-doubts aside, and spurred on by his
sense of duty and love for his beautiful, intellectually equal,
colleague, Carol Ferris, he is soon called to defend mankind from
Parallax, a super-powerful being who feeds on fear. He is the
universe&#x27;s last chance, as many Lanterns have been killed and the Corps
is weakened. And he might just be the right Lantern for the job of
keeping the world safe from harm.&#x27; <br /><br />Martin Campbell directs the solid cast of seen and unseen characters:
Ryan Reynolds shines as Hal Jordan, our &#x27;Green Lantern&#x27;, Taika Waititi
is Hal&#x27;s best friend Tom, Blake Lively is solid as Carol Ferris, Peter
Sarsgaard morphs as Hector (Hal&#x27;s brother), Tim Robbins is the father
figure, Mark Strong is the Spock-like Lantern from another planet,
Angela Bassett steps in as the secretive Doctor Waller, Temuera
Morrison is the lantern space alien who passes the ring to Hal after
succumbing to the evil of Clancy Brown as the ominous Paralax, there
are some fine voiceovers for the creatures of the Planet AO - Geoffrey
Rush as Tomar-Re, Michael Clarke Duncan as Kilowog, and Warren Burton
and Salome Jens as the Guardians. <br /><br />Ryan Reynolds has such a strong positive screen presence that he is
able to make us root for his flying sculpted body Green Lantern. Though
the film had bad press and failed to create box office accolades, it is
a strong movie for this genre. Seeing on Amazon Instant Video gives it
a full screen treatment to try before buying the DVD. It is better than
expected. <br /><br />Grady Harp
