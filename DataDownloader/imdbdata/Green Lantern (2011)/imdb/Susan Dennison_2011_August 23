I am so sad for not liking this film.<br /><br />I love Ryan Reinolds and Martin Campbell is a very good director. In
fact, this film&#x27;s lack of quality is not so much their blame. The
problem with this film is the screenplay.<br /><br />It is a paint by the numbers story filled with characters we do not
care and painful clich&#xE9;s. There are too many cheesy moments, such as
the scene where GL saves the helicopter from crashing by building a
giant racetrack. This film has a big budget, but the screenplay is like
an early 90&#x27;s superhero film.<br /><br />Mark Strong is great as Sinestro though.
