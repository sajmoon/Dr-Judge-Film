This movie didn&#x27;t make the top 3 movies I saw this year, but I thought
it was still good. Here&#x27;s why: <br /><br />There was plenty of action, and plenty of romance. I thought some of
the great pro&#x27;s of this movie was the CGI, which was very well
constructed, and also the storyline, which was very nice as well. I
didn&#x27;t think too much romance was necessary in the movie because this
is an Action movie. Also, some of the sound effects were too loud and
really made my ears ring. Other than that, I thought the movie was
excellent.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie for everyone. This is why I gave the Green
Lantern an 8/10.
