Just home from watching the green lantern, and i have to say i was
really impressed. The always impressive Ryan Reynolds was great in the
lead role of Hal Jordan who has been chosen as the new green lantern.
This is an effects heavy movie but they are jaw dropping and some of
the action sequences are totally amazing, the plots not hard to follow,
i cant understand how this film is being so heavily criticized. Right
from the start of the film we are taking on a real roller-coaster ride,
given an in depth explanation of the green lantern corps and what they
stand for. The fantastic mark strong gives great support as usual, and
it was nice to see Angela Bassett in a small part. Totally recommended
and i hope its not the last we see of the green lantern!!!
