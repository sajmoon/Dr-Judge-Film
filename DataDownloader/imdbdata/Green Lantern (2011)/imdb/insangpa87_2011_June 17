After using IMDb for about 10 years this is my first time writing a
review so here goes.<br /><br />I am a big fan of DC Comics and Green Lantern is definitely one of my
favorites as I even own quite a volume of comics of him. I wasn&#x27;t
really looking forward to this movie since every time I do I always got
let down. My first thought after hearing Parallax being in the movie I
was wondering if they would do it like in the comics. But that didn&#x27;t
make sense because this is only the first movie and the studio would
make it as an origin movie not something else. The whole thing seemed a
little tad slow and I think they tried to do character developments and
get the story going but even for a fan I kind of found it hard to
follow. It wasn&#x27;t engaging enough I suppose. There were some action
scenes but that also didn&#x27;t really live up to expectations. I thought
they had the right director and actors for this movie but something was
missing from the comics. <br /><br />If they ever make a sequel to this movie I do hope they hire someone
from DC to write a script and have the sort of impact Iron Man did back
in 2008. I do have a feeling this is going to be another Superman
Returns though.
