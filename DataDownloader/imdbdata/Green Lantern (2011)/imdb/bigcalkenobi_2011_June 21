Green Lantern is DC&#x27;s biggest hope to launch the DC universe to the big
screen. Other than Green Lantern the only real DC adaptations have been
either Batman or Superman adaptations. DC promised that Green Lantern
would not only bring that character to the big screen and but would
also lay the ground work for their future film adaptations of their
other heroes such as the Flash or Wonder Woman. Those are some pretty
big promises to fill considering the only real recent success DC has
had with their super hero franchises has been Nolan&#x27;s Batman series.
This movie was truly a gamble on DC&#x27;s part if they really hoped to
bring their comic book universe to the big screen. Luckily the movie
does boast quite a bit of talent from stars Ryan Reynolds,Mark Strong,
Temuera Morrison, and the voices of Michael Clarke Duncan and Geoffrey
Rush as well as the director Martin Campbell (director of Casino
Royale). So despite the fact that this movie was a big risk it appears
that DC may have something special on their hands. Did Green Lantern
successfully launch the DC film universe or should we just stick to The
Dark Knight for our DC fix?<br /><br />Check out the rest of my review out here:
