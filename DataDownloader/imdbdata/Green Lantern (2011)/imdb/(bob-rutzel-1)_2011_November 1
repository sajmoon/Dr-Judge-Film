A Green Lantern from another planet crashes on earth, but before he
dies, he tells the ring to find someone worthy of the ring (and, it&#x27;s
power, of course). The ring finds Hal Jordan (Reynolds) a cocky,
somewhat irresponsible test pilot. Did the ring make a mistake? This
new Green Lantern will need to find a way to be accepted into the Green
Lantern club and to save the earth from Parallax a power more powerful
than all the Green Lanterns combined. <br /><br />The something missing is very important here. What could it be? Ah, I
didn&#x27;t like anyone in the cast. Oh, the story was okay, the actors and
their dialogues (read no good lines) were okay, the CGI was fantastic
to say the least, but the non-likability factor reined throughout. In
the THOR movie, I liked everyone. (Is it fair to compare the two
movies?) Yes, indeed. This movie didn&#x27;t talk to me the way the THOR
movie did. All was okay, just not likable enough. This movie talked to
itself, not to me, and it was more interested in showing us the CGI
than anything else. And, the CGI was fantastic as I mentioned. <br /><br />When Carol (Lively), Hal&#x27;s sometime girl friend, finds out that Hal is
the Green Latern and takes her time , while looking straight at him, I
was shocked. What took her so long? Any fool can see it is Hal in a
green costume. The mask didn&#x27;t really do the job too well. She asks
Hal, &#x22;where did the mask come from?&#x22; He replies, &#x22;it came with the
suit.&#x22; And, that boys and girls is about the best line in here. <br /><br />Just a quick thought. The evil power Parallax seems to have been
Doomsday resurrected from the Smallville TV series. Hey, an evil power
needs to live also. Besides he needed the gig. HA!<br /><br />I noticed that Mark Strong (Sinestro) finally plays a good guy Green
Lantern, but wait a minute. Watch as the credits role and you will see
Sincestro try on the Yellow Ring (the one that produces fear in all),
and watch closely as his eyes widen and then narrow, and it is then
that you know, we will see Green Lantern 2. And, then we will see Mark
Strong as the bad guy again. Does this mean as he should be? We will
just have to wait and see. <br /><br />I think we have seen movies for almost all of the comic book super
heroes&#x85;&#x85;&#x85;&#x85;well, except for Mandrake the Magician, Green Arrow,
Plasticman, Aquaman, Captain Marvel, the Flash, Superboy, and Wonder
Woman. But, stay tuned, they are probably not far behind. <br /><br />Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.
