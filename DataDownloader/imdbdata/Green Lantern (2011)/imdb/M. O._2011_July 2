I really don&#x27;t know anything about Green Lantern more than is shown in
the Justice League animated series. Fans are claiming it a fair
adaptation based on the early years of the hero. But for me, as a
movie, Green Lantern gives the feeling that something is missing and
there are a lot of reasons for that. Being a Marting Campbell movie,
the same director of great action flicks such as GoldenEye (1995), The
Mask Of Zorro (1998), Vertical Limit (2000) and Casino Royale (2006), I
was expecting something much more fun and full of intense action,
interesting dialogs and an effective construction of scenes as people
claim that Green Lantern is one of the best and most devalued DC Comic
characters. Also, the screenplay has been written by 4 people, so it&#x27;s
the necessary number to know that things weren&#x27;t good enough and
probably wouldn&#x27;t be good enough in the end.<br /><br />The intense industrial production of movies based on comic books is
creating their own Parallax, I mean... it&#x27;s being destructive for their
own, devouring everything, adapting anything as possible just to fill
their bank accounts giving zero attention for the quality. When the new
generation of comic book adaptations hit the theaters in the beginning
of 00&#x27;s they were great because things were being planed for years. The
biggest fear of everyone was how far this would go? It was just a
matter of time till comic book adaptations become habitual. And now
this intense production is giving sings of tiredness. The time between
a screen writing and pre-production to its release is incredibly short,
something about 6/8 months, and we cannot ignore the fact that this is
something that reflects its quality. X-Men: First Class (2011), for
example, had been planed for years and is the best comic book
adaptation of 2011 so far (but it doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s the best comic
book adaptation).<br /><br />When making a movie, studios try to achieve the biggest number of
people as possible, so it cannot be adult enough nor naive enough, it
cannot be intelligent enough nor stupid enough. Everything needs to be
&#x27;in between&#x27;. Sometimes it works, but sometimes not. Also, they are
creating a comic book adaptation formula that isn&#x27;t working anymore. As
David White says in his review: &#x22;I want superhero movies to involve
something more than setting up a marginally interesting premise so that
there can be more sequels (...) I want to feel like something real is
at stake.&#x22;<br /><br />After one hour of movie nothing happens and Parallax is just some hours
before swallow entire Earth, and then you realize that Green Lantern
will have only 30 minutes to become the best super hero as possible
even with just 2 minutes of training, conquer the girl, fight with
Elephant Man and destroy a space monster that not even the best Green
Lanterns were able to do but also destroy a monster that killed the
king of Green Lanterns called Abin Sur. That is absurd. Not even the
animated series makes Green Lantern so omnipotent. The best part of the
movie for me is when Parallax says that Hall is nothing without the
ring, because that&#x27;s true and also Peter Sasgard that gives the serious
tone that the movie lacks but also his talent and character are wasted
in the whole movie. Aside that, there isn&#x27;t a single scene that I could
be amazed or breathless because not even the special effects are good
enough and seems much more a rush-jobbed thing than anything else,
maybe a result of the short post-production time I&#x27;ve said above and
the lack of time for screen tests.<br /><br />So, I mean... the movie isn&#x27;t entertaining because it pushes too hard
on the plot and things just happens incredibly fast in the last 20
minutes being hard to accept. Also, there is that thing about the
Yellow Ring that leads to nowhere more than a 5 seconds scene, so it
makes you think that: &#x22;Oh, we forgot about the Yellow Ring! That&#x27;s
okay, just put that scene and everything&#x27;s fine and maybe we can
resolve that on a 2nd installment. People will not even notice that.&#x22;<br /><br />A lame and boring super hero movie. Could have been excellent, but not
even 4 screenwriters were able to give it the tone. Fans can accept it
a fair adaptation for the elements used to define the character and his
powers, which seems a lot fair as some comic books fans have stated,
but in the end it&#x27;s just another catch-money machine, a movie able to
satisfy the comic books fans but not the other ones looking for a truly
impressive action flick to give them real interest to the comics.
