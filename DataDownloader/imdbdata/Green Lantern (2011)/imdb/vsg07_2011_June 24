If you look at the team behind Green Lantern, you will find the actors
and behind the camera crew are the best possible fit anybody could ever
find. Ryan Reynolds can bring any role to life with his charm and wit.
Blake Lively was perfectly cast as Carol. Peter Saarsgard as the
villain (watch for his scenes. They were for me the highlights of the
film). Mark Strong as Sinestro is pitch perfect. And Martin Campbell
(the man who brought James Bond to life twice in the last 2 decades) in
the director&#x27;s chair was the best possible decision taken by the
producers.<br /><br />The question you should be asking right now is what went wrong then?
THE SCRIPT. I don&#x27;t think the writers have been following the comic
book movies since 2008. Otherwise, they would have known that Dark
Knight / Iron-man changed everything. People now expect more from
movies inspired by comics. No wonder it took 3 people to write the
story and 4 to write the screenplay. One single person cant be this
dumb.<br /><br />The story of Green Lantern as most of you know by now is about Hal
Jordan a fearless pilot who is give a ring of power and asked to
protect earth (sector 2814). And then they have the part where he
learns how to use the new found power and the part where he tries to
save the girl and an eccentric evil genius and a threat to the earth
and many other side-plots. If you read the last sentence again, you
will notice that it was the story of Superman (Also, the editor of GL
is from Superman itself). Kilowog and Tomar-Re are just props and not
that impressive.<br /><br />On the whole, Green Lantern is going to leave you wanting for more and
not in a good way. I still cant believe Martin Campbell was involved in
this. Also, I call for Ryan Reynolds not to be involved in DEADPOOL -
Just coz he killed Green Lantern.
