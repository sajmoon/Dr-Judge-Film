The Green Lantern is by no means a masterpiece. It is simply for
entertain. I&#x27;ve read some of the bad reviews, and I think to myself.
&#x27;Paid movie critics are stupid.&#x27; That&#x27;s plain and simple. Critics go to
a movie not to enjoy, but to bash, because it&#x27;s there job. The bad
reviews simply do not match with this movie. The critics obviously saw
the Green Lantern thinking it&#x27;ll be like The Dark Knight. It is nowhere
near close to being as good as The Dark Knight. This film is to be
enjoyed, not to be watched thinking it&#x27;ll be like Batman.<br /><br />This movie has everything a movie for pure entertainment should have.
It has incredible CGI and an amazing story line. I will admit the
acting is mediocre at best. That does not effect the movie very much.<br /><br />Hal Jordan is a test pilot who is given a ring. With this ring he
becomes part of the Green Lantern Corps. His mission, to keep peace in
the universe.<br /><br />The CGI in this movie is very believable. With a 200 million dollar
budget I&#x27;d be surprised if is wasn&#x27;t. The best of the CG came from the
planet where the corps are. Believe it or not, Ryan Reynolds entire
suit is CG. It is truly believably real. It looks like any other suit,
just with a glow to it. 3D definitely enhances the way his suit looks.
3D makes his suit even more realistic. I suggest you see it in 3D. If
you don&#x27;t your missing something.<br /><br />The acting had only one strong actor who was truly believable. Mark
Strong is by far the best actor in the entire film. Ryan Reynolds
acting is better that mediocre but not by much. Supporting actors
weren&#x27;t really that great either. Like I said the only great acting in
the whole movie was by Mark Strong.<br /><br />I honestly had only three major problems with this film. One was Tom.
Tom in the story is Hal&#x27;s best friend. I felt like he just held the
movie back. Thankfully he didn&#x27;t have much screen time. The actor who
played him (Taika Waititi) was pretty terrible. The second problem I
had was Peter Sarsgaard, he played Hector. The acting by him in the
beginning of the film is very good. Towards the end though he sounds,
well lets just say he sounds like he hangs out with girls and has a
boyfriend. The third problem I have is how many times it failed being
funny. Honestly they must&#x27;ve gotten Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer
(Disaster Movie) to write the jokes. The movie has only two laugh
moments. The rest of the laughs were just failed by whoever wrote them.<br /><br />All and all this is a good film for just sitting back and relaxing to.
Not the best super hero movie ever, but not the worst. I do hope they
make a sequel, but I doubt it since it&#x27;s only made 80 million dollars
on a 200 million dollar budget so far. I won&#x27;t give up hope though.<br /><br />*note* stay after credits.
