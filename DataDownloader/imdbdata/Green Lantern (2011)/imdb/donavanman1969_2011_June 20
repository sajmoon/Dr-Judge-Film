Don&#x27;t know why folks are dogging the flick. It&#x27;s good. Not great (Dark
Knight, X-2, Iron Man) but not Hulk (first one) either. Development is
not really slow. Ryan is much cooler than wimpy tobey mcguire. It is
witty, and the folks act like real people. Come on--you find out you
have super powers aren&#x27;t you going to gloat at least a little bit?
There could have been more to it--better development of Eo, guardians,
etc., but we didn&#x27;t go to the movies to watch star wars rejects fight.
we came here to see GL kick some booty and entertain us. Do yourself
and us a favor. See it. The 2nd will be even better because we won&#x27;t
have to spend as much time on introducing the characters.
