I tried not to take this one seriously, but this is definitely one for
the kids. The entire movie plays out like a childish fantasy. Even the
character depth and emotion shown by the characters seems to be written
by a child who has little to no understanding of how real adults think
and act.<br /><br />Perhaps important to note is that I am a fan of superhero movies. In
particular, the X-Men films, Burton and Nolan&#x27;s interpretations of
Batman, and the films tying into the upcoming Avengers film. I am also
a fan of both fantasy and science fiction films, such as Lord of the
Rings and Star Trek respectively. Needless to say, I can appreciate and
enjoy films that take great liberties with reality and pure inventions
of human imagination. However, Green Lantern did not impress me. Not as
a superhero movie. Not as a science fiction. Not as a film in general.<br /><br />Plot - 2/10. What we see are a random series of events that have no
meaning and build up to a 2 minute climax in which the inexperienced
protagonist effortlessly defeats an infinitely powerful ancient entity.
Some of the most clich&#xE9; and juvenile themes are tossed at us, such as
&#x22;I&#x27;m a brilliant scientist with a good career, but Daddy doesn&#x27;t
understand me and is embarrassed by me&#x22; and &#x22;We love each other, but we
can&#x27;t be together because of my sad feelings that you wouldn&#x27;t
understand&#x22;. We&#x27;re expected to believe that overcoming fear is a
superhero trait found in one person out of billions. Too bad this one
person is immature, irresponsible, and filled to the brim with
insecurity. AKA, a teenager.<br /><br />So many of the ideas that we&#x27;re expected to accept will only make you
roll your eyes. Green is for willpower and it&#x27;s the strongest force in
the universe! Yellow means fear and is very bad and also grants you
telepathy and telekinesis! Stay away from ugly people, they&#x27;re evil!
&#x22;The ring didn&#x27;t choose you because you&#x27;re fearless. It chose you
because you have the capacity to overcome your fear.&#x22; WHAT?!<br /><br />Acting - 4/10. Reynolds, who I thought was excellent as Deadpool, falls
short of adequacy in a more serious role. He has one wooden expression
for the entire film. Even his comedic lines are delivered with a total
straight face. Though I&#x27;m not very familiar with the source material,
I&#x27;m also under the impression that this interpretation is quite a
radical departure from the comic book version, though I suppose that I
should expect a dumbed down and adolescent version of the original hero
given the themes of the film. The female lead, Lively, seems better
suited for soap operas and other daytime dramas. In a few scenes, she
completely overacts and in others she shows no emotion when she clearly
should be. Given the depth of the film, I suppose the only requirement
of her role was to stand around and look pretty and I suppose she does
that well enough. However, I would have liked to see a more meaningful
character that did more than act as cheerleader for the hero.<br /><br />The real performances, and the reason why I give 4/10, are with the
supporting cast. When you have a supporting cast that outshines the
leading roles, that&#x27;s a sure sign of poor direction, but at least it
was entertaining to watch. Strong and Sarsgaard in particular displayed
excellent acting, but unfortunately neither had enough screen time.<br /><br />Characters - 3/10. Maybe, I&#x27;m just crazy, but my favourite character
was Hector, the peaceful scientist turned villain. We see a man with a
great enthusiasm for his work, a respectable career as a college
professor, and a sense of humility when entrusted with the very
prestigious honour of examining the first recovered alien life form. We
see him question this honour, citing that others are more deserving and
have waited longer and see him become disappointed when he learns that
it was the result of strings pulled. It shows a great human quality in
him. He doesn&#x27;t want to get far in life because of political
connections. He wants to succeed on his own merits. However, my
interest in the character vanished when he&#x27;s nipped by the entity of
fear and suddenly, he&#x27;s a mind-reader who tosses students about the
classroom and attempts to blow up his father&#x27;s helicopter. Yes. A
humble and respectable man turns into a psychopath within 20 seconds of
film. There isn&#x27;t even a downward spiral or devolution of character.
There&#x27;s just nice guy -&#x3E; infected -&#x3E; killing people. Bam.<br /><br />The other members of the Green Lantern Corp were also compelling and
interesting for their whopping 5 minutes of screen time each. Other
characters were so thinly written and one dimensional that they&#x27;re not
even worth mentioning, even the lead characters. It wasn&#x27;t just bad
acting that made the characters boring. It was the writing and
direction.<br /><br />Overall - 3/10. Just because it&#x27;s science fiction and just because it&#x27;s
a superhero film doesn&#x27;t mean that it has to be childish and completely
void of competent writing or direction. On a final note, perhaps
writers and director should have researched the science a little more.
Things like a fight in an asteroid belt beside the sun are transparent
to an elementary school student. It also didn&#x27;t help that the Green
Lanterns at the beginning of the film wore full spacesuits, whereas the
ones at the end were perfectly capable of breathing in outer space.
