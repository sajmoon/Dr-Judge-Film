When i heard that Green Lantern make his big screen debut for the very
first time, i feel really excited.. because besides Batman &#x26; Superman,
Mr. Hal Jordan is also my favorite DC superheroes character. with Ryan
Reynolds play as the heroes, i feel more certain that this movie would
be a good one. but after i watched the movie, well i feel disappointed.<br /><br />The opening scene is very intriguing and promising.. but, from half
through to the end is very very flat.. here&#x27;s the thing, although the
studio pick a great cast on it, still, if the script just taken very
straightly from the comics without the improvisation in it, well the
results is very boring.. that&#x27;s the main problem of this film.<br /><br />about the acting of the cast well.. Ryan Reynolds still the man... i&#x27;m
a little bit surprise with Peter Sarsgaard.. he plays quite good and
convincing as the main villain of this movie, Hector Hammond. only
Blake Lively whose her acting just went so-so..<br /><br />oh yeah i almost forgot, the special effect of this movie actually
quite good. especially the view of the Oa planet.. very bright yet
beautiful.. but please don&#x27;t compare it to Asgard or Gotham City..
especially Asgard... :)<br /><br />so my summary of this movie: i f u all just want to get entertain, this
movie is not a bad one. but if u are the fan of superhero movies,
simply just put his movie on ur DVD shelf and after that rewind over &#x26;
over again your Batman or Superman collection...
