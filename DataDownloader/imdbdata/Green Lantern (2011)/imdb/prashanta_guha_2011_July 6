2011_July 6 
Well, to be honest, after you&#x27;ve seen tons of trailers about the
amazing VFX constructs which the power ring is supposed to make
(including the mini-gun, now a favorite) anyone, like me, would be
excited to watch the movie as soon as it hits the screens. After coming
out of the theater though, I&#x27;d say I was mildly disappointed.<br /><br />The story (familiar with Green Lantern: First Flight and adapted from
other comics too) and the screenplay weren&#x27;t satisfying, or should I
say, weren&#x27;t worth a superhero movie. I mean, the direction was good,
even though the director had worked on only James Bond movies before,
so this is like a whole new realm for him. But for whatever the reason,
I personally think the writes could have come up with something better,
or at least a better ending (fingers crossed for the sequel).<br /><br />On the plus side, amazing VFX, including the constructs and the fully-
CGI power suits of the lanterns. Some people complained about a lot of
green, well, my reply to them would be &#x22;look at the title&#x22;. Well-
choreographed fight scenes and entertaining to watch (at least once).<br /><br />If the story/screenplay would have been a little more thought out, I&#x27;d
happily given it a 9. A only-for-comic-book-fans, one time entertaining
movie.
