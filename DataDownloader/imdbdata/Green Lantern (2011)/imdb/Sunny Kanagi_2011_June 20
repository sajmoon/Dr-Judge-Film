This is one of the worst superhero movie I&#x27;ve ever seen...<br /><br />I had enough of the bad-a$$ attitude of the hero, the sad love story
between the hero and his lover, experiencing the awesomeness after
getting the power... haven&#x27;t we all seen this in Spiderman or
Superman??<br /><br />The villain was shown like an idiot who is defeated by our hero in what
was like a 2 minute climax(when all the experienced and smart Green
Lanterns of the Universe fail to) And these Green Lanterns arrive after
the hero defeats the villain, just like the Police in any Hollywood
movie.<br /><br />The Special Effects was so stupid and childish, even a 3 year old would
mock this movie. <br /><br />Acting wise Peter Sarsgaard was good. Blake Lively was pretty. Ryan
Reynolds carried one expression on his face in the entire movie, he
almost made Twilight actors look Oscar worthy. Tim Robins was wasted in
the movie. The other Green Lanterns were hardly present.<br /><br />If you want to save yourself from anger and frustration, then please
avoid this movie. The critics were right to mock this movie.. <br /><br />this movie maybe for hardcore comic fans.. Rest all watch Kung Fu Panda
2 or Hangover 2 again....
