You&#x27;re asking why this movie has gotten such low reviews? It&#x27;s because
it premiered 2 weeks after &#x22;X-Men: First Class&#x22; did! While this was a
pretty good action film by itself, I couldn&#x27;t help but compare this
movie to &#x22;X-Men: First Class&#x22; (which was superb, if I must say) and the
fairly new &#x22;Thor&#x22;.<br /><br />&#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; started out well. Fast-paced and full of action and
just.. Riveting. But then somewhere along the line, the exciting factor
dropped. The pacing became choppy and the scenery began to look fake.
(I&#x27;m not sure if the background behind Carol&#x27;s house was real or not,
but to me, it looked fake.)<br /><br />I also felt like there were too many thing happening at once. The film
was too messy. The scenes kept alternating between Earth, Oa and outer
space. The movie tried to show what was happening in all three places
at once and failed. If the movie just focused on one point at a time,
the film could have gone so much better. My golly, the transitions were
horrible. I remember leaning in towards my sister more than once to
ask, &#x22;Why is he there now?&#x22; <br /><br />I think that major flaw of this movie was Blake Lively. While I love
Blake Lively, I couldn&#x27;t help but think that her character wasn&#x27;t
really needed. She was nothing, but the needed love interest of another
superhero. The scenes between Ryan and Blake could have been scrapped
altogether to be replaced by more action scenes. I think that the movie
would have done so much better if this was the case.<br /><br />I&#x27;ll say this again: I may just be comparing this movie to the other
recently released Marvel movies that I watched, so my rating may not
have been fair at all. I think that is the case with many other
reviews, too. But disregarding the fact that this was shown after
&#x22;X-Men: First Class&#x22;, I think that &#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; was pretty adequate
for a Marvel film. It had good humor, at least 2 good fighting scenes
and.. Oh, who am I kidding, just watch the damn film if you really have
to. But just know that &#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; REALLY falls short when compared
to &#x27;another-Marvel-film-that-starts-with-X&#x27;.<br /><br />Viewed on: June 25, 2011
