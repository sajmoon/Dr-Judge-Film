2011_June 20 
As someone who&#x27;s followed Green Lantern a little bit of a decent amount
(not big but fairly decent, for DC character), I liked some things
about the movie; but I definitely say that it could have been made
better, both for casual fans, non-GL fans or hard core ones.<br /><br />Good points... 1. It stuck fairly consistently with the mythos of the
origin and Planet OA; 2. Ryan Reynolds did decently as Hal Jordan
(though he fits more with the Kyle Rayner/Guy Gardner type than Jordan)
-- but I wish he was more serious; though non-GL fans couldn&#x27;t care
less about this; 3. Blake Lively was eye candy; super hot, but not much
else; 4. Green Lanterns Tomar Re, Kilowog and Abin Sur were damn good
but didn&#x27;t have enough screen time to be significant; 5. Mark Strong&#x27;s
Sinestro was excellent! 6. Hector Hammond was well portrayed by Peter
Saarsgard (though it lacked a proper finish) 7. Good supporting cast
from Tim Robbins (Sen. Hammond) to Angela Bassett (Amanda Waller); 8.
Green Lantern&#x27;s costume was wicked; 9. Visual/CGI effects were pretty
good<br /><br />Bad Points... &#x3E; It tried to fit too much into one movie, moving back
and forth from Earth and outer space/OA, thus there was no proper
flow... (like when there was a build up of momentum, things go slow or
boring; or from serious to funny without proper pacing); too many
stories were crammed into one movie &#x3E; Humor was misplaced at times
(good peg is Thor which had it in the flow rather than
contrived/forced) &#x3E; Parallax looked comical; scary at times but only a
couple of times &#x3E; Like Iron Man 2, I wish the fight scenes were so much
more; they spent too much on the set-up that the fights were short and
could have been so much more and elaborate. &#x3E; Some scenes and even some
characters were not necessary (Hal&#x27;s best friend, even some scenes with
Blake&#x27;s Carol Ferris were not needed); they should have added more
action instead<br /><br />Summary, visual effects, actors, GL base story good. But the way the
writers and director put things together were a mixture of various
plots and subplots crazy glued into one movie for pure entertainment.
Kids will enjoy it, but adults likely will not. This is a summer of
superheroes, with 3 down and one more to go (well, technically 5 with
Transformers if you&#x27;re thinking comic book stories), so it&#x27;s quite
impossible not to compare them to each other.<br /><br />The director is known to direct good flicks like Goldeneye and Casino
Royale (two good movies), but I wish he did more; studied more, had
split up more stories to be more single- minded and not work on a
cluttered material.
