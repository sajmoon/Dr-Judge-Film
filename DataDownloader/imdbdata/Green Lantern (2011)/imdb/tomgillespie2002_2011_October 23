Disgraced aircraft pilot Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) is chosen by a
green ring to be Earth&#x27;s representative in the Green Lantern Corps - a
police force that spans the galaxy that protects the universe from
evil. The ring gives him the power to materialise his imagination into
a green force powered by will. The ring was brought to Earth by a
crash-landed alien, Abin Sur (Temuera Morrison) who had, in the past,
defeated a deadly foe named Parallax (voiced by Clancy Brown), who
after escaping from his prison, attacked Abin Sur and caused him to
flee his planet. Meanwhile, scientist Hector Hammond (Peter Sargaard),
son of Senator Robert Hammond (Tim Robbins), is brought in to perform
the autopsy on Abin Sur. A part of Parallax that has lingered with his
corpse latches on to Hector, causing him to develop telekinetic powers
and a rather large forehead.<br /><br />Green Lantern is one of those adaptation that has been thrown around
Hollywood for years, with many writers, directors and stars named as
possibilities and then dismissed as quickly as the idea came around.
For some films, this proves a good thing. An example, Zack Snyder&#x27;s
Watchmen (2009), was a hell of a long time coming, with the likes of
Arnold Schwarzenegger being banded round to star as Dr. Manhattan. But
several writers and directors later, it came to someone who had a
passion for the material, and he created something very good and loyal
to the graphic novel. While it was by no means a perfect film, it was
just about as good as one could hope from a movie adaptation of a very
difficult novel. In the case of Green Lantern, perhaps the troublesome
journey from comic book to screen was there for a reason, as the
finished film is pretty poor.<br /><br />As likable as Ryan Reynolds usually is, he doesn&#x27;t have the charisma or
the lovable rogueishness that, say, Robert Downey Jr. has as Tony Stark
in Iron Man (2008). Hal Jordan is generally unlikeable - he is cocky,
reckless and selfish. Tony Stark&#x27;s arrogance makes him stand out, and
separates him from the mere mortals he swears to protect. Jordan is
seen at the beginning of the film sacrificing his wing-man (or
wing-woman - the sexy Blake Lively as Carol Ferris) in order to beat a
rival company in a dog-fight. He is evidently an emotionally torn
character - we see this in an extremely soppy flashback which shows us
how Jordan witnessed his father blowing up in front of his eyes. Well
boo f*****g hoo. I couldn&#x27;t ever warm to his character because he
doesn&#x27;t deserve his power. Perhaps if his back-story was served with a
little less cheddar and a bit more originality then maybe I could root
for him.<br /><br />The premise that he can harness his imagination as his power is an
interesting one, and certainly one ripe with limitless possibility. Yet
director Martin Campbell (Casino Royale (2006), The Mask of Zorro
(1998)) and the four different screenwriters seem to leave many gaping
plot holes. Jordan is seen throwing up fast and imaginative defences
when being trained by Green Lantern Corps combat trainer Kilowog
(Michael Clarke Duncan), yet when being faced by the giant-headed
Hammond, everything goes out the window. Hammond holds Carol as hostage
when Jordan bursts in brandishing his ring (the one on his finger!)
when Hammond makes him aware that Carol is being held telekinetically
in mid- air with a syringe filled with what I can only imagine as
poison floating near her neck. Jordan appears to be helpless. So why
doesn&#x27;t he imagine a steel wall around Carol, and a giant knife across
Hammond&#x27;s throat? Because that would be to easy and would require the
writers to come with better ideas, of course.<br /><br />The film really isn&#x27;t quite as bad as the critics have made it out to
be. It is sporadically fun, and features the ever-watchable Mark Strong
as Green Lantern Corps leader Sinestro. But the film is just so
annoyingly stupid that it made me question why someone so stupid would
be chosen to wield such power. And the script is so bad that you can
hear the desperation to try and forge some humour out of the thinly-
written supporting characters (the &#x27;comedy relief&#x27; best-friend is so
bad the director just seems to cut him out of the movie half way
through). Not exactly a Ghost Rider (2007) sized pile of steaming s**t,
but nothing to give Christopher Nolan sleepless nights. DC better book
up their ideas, as Marvel seem to be running away with it (although
Marvel have yet to make a film as good as The Dark Knight (2008)).<br /><br />www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com
