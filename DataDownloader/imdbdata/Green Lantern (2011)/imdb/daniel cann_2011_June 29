DC superhero Green Lantern gets its big budget film adaptation this
summer. Directed by James Bond director Martin Campbell and with a cast
that includes heavyweights like Geoffrey Rush, Tim Robbins and Mark
Strong it has a good pedigree.<br /><br />The plot concerns ace test pilot Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) who upon
discovering the wreckage of an alien craft inherits the ring and
lantern from purple skinned extraterrestrial Abin Sur (Star Wars
Temuera Morrison). The ring and lantern bestow superhuman powers as
well as membership to the Green Lantern Corps, guardians of the galaxy
from the planet Oa, responsible for maintaining peace. It is not long
before infected scientist Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard) coupled with
the awesome Parallax, an entity that feeds on the yellow energy of fear
that the safety and well being of earth is in peril.<br /><br />What I liked about this film is that it does not take itself too
seriously it notably references other superhero franchises like
&#x27;Spiderman&#x27; with a riff on the &#x27;with power comes great responsibility&#x27;
line. Reynolds is perfectly suited (pardon the pun) to portray Jordan
a.k.a. the Green Lantern as he has shown a gift for playing likable
comic characters in &#x27;Just Friends&#x27; and &#x27;Definitely, Maybe&#x27; whereas his
action hero credentials have been exhibited in the likes of &#x27;Blade:
Trinity.&#x27; Blake Lively is Carol Ferris, Jordan&#x27;s long-term girlfriend,
apart from looking pretty and getting into danger, Lively is not given
much else to do unfortunately but she has good chemistry with Reynolds.
Mark Strong as Sinestro, Geoffrey Rush as Tomar-Re and Michael Clarke
Duncan as Kilowog are also criminally underused. Apart from Rush
providing narration and aiding his two colleagues with Jordan&#x27;s
training the trio don&#x27;t really do much. You get the impression that
these allies of Jordan are deliberately held back so that attention is
not drawn away from the title character, which is another pity.<br /><br />That said the special effects and musical score are outstanding and the
money is all up there on the big screen. It&#x27;s just that the overall
execution seems a little flat. Not a bad effort overall and certainly
its target audience of young children, teenagers and fans of the comic
book won&#x27;t be disappointed. You can&#x27;t really go to a film like this and
expect life changing high art or existentialist drama. It is what it is
and accepted on its own terms its undemanding lightweight fun.
