In brightest day, in blackest night, lack of serious acting and a
limited script makes this film bite. There is only one reason to see
this film: the visuals. And you do not need to spend a fortune to see
them in 3D since there are not many. Somewhere, somehow, some idiot
decided to make Hal Jordan into Ryan Reynolds and not have Reynolds act
like Hal Jordan. He isn&#x27;t likable, he is arrogant and cocky--nothing
compared to the Hal Jordan of the comics who was a dedicated
professional pilot who is loyal. The movie version of Hal Jordan is a
mirror image of today&#x27;s youth: arrogant, unreliable, womanizer, who
runs away from responsibility. The visuals are the only thing worth
seeing. Wait until it hits BluRay and you will be more satisfied.
