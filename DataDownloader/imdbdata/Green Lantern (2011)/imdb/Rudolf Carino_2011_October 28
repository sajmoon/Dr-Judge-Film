I just watched this new Green Lantern film on VCD just a few days ago,
and I figure this one has pretty much everything people can expect from
a super hero movie. For instance, there are a couple of times where the
title character gets into near-death experiences but was able to get
out of it, a very essential theme for films of this genre. Another
great theme used shows how the hero went from being a misfit to someone
worth being part of the fighting force.<br /><br />There&#x27;s probably a number of explanations why this film did little in
the box office. But I figure the most logical reason might be that the
title character isn&#x27;t as famous as those other DC Comics heroes. I
mean, I&#x27;ve been hearing about Superman and Batman when I was a kid. As
for Green Lantern, I never heard of him until the Justice League series
appeared in Cartoon Network. Anyway, I do find that green guy cool to
watch.
