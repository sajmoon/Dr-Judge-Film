While I enjoyed the Green Lantern, there were definitely areas that
were lacking. I think the script was okay, but could have been far
better. It was the ad-libs that help save it.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan was endearing, likable and yet strong and
focused. I found him believable in the character role. He was smart,
funny, charming, powerful, courageous and fearless.<br /><br />Mark Strong as Sinestro was clearly the strongest actor in character.
He was excellent in the role. He played a power-hungry, cold and steely
character well.<br /><br />Blake Lively was the weak link in the story, and possibly because of
the way it was written and possibly because of the way she interpreted
her character. She was dull, boring and even her attempt to be a vamp
failed. I felt her character could have been completely cut from the
story and it could have been strengthened. It would have allowed an
earlier entrance of the evil enemy and more interactions with Hal and
Sinestro,which was the best part of the film.<br /><br />Was this the best super-hero film of the summer? No, but I don&#x27;t blame
the acting (other than Blake&#x27;s which I thought was dull and boring). It
was ill-paced, and a poor script that hurt this film.<br /><br />Did I find the film still worth a ticket to the theater? Yes. It still
entertained, which is ultimately the real purpose of a film.
