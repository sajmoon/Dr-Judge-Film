I went to see this film because the 3d projector broke down on the film
we were going to see and this was picked because a) it started at the
right time b) it was 3d and c) it was a superhero film. So, I had no
expectations and didn&#x27;t know about reviews so no pre-conceptions.<br /><br />I go to the cinema to relax and be entertained. This film did just
that. Decent performances all round (although the Green Lantern mask
was a bit much - so bijou!) good special fx and it managed to avoid
that 15 minute period where you think &#x22;this is a bit slow&#x22;. As it drew
to a close I found myself thinking &#x22;I really enjoyed this&#x22;. It might
not be the greatest film ever made but I thought it good fun and it
kept me entertained - and surely that is the purpose of a film like
this.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t know why folks seem to expect a film with the depth of a
Shakespeare or Hemmingway classic - it comes from a comic for goodness
sake and it does what its source did - entertained.
