You get quite a lot of different types of action and effects in all
sorts of settings. So its quite an all round adventure. Unfortunately
the story is a bit overblown and silly. I&#x27;m not familiar with the Green
Hornet comics so maybe they were being faithful to the comics but I
didn&#x27;t find the story line compelling. There are some draggy moments in
between the intergalactic sequences. At first I thought Ryan Reynolds
wasn&#x27;t quite leading man charismatic for the hero but the tone is light
and comical so he is adequate. Blake Lively is quite attractive as a
brunette. Compared to recent comic book hero movies I preferred Captain
America. Overall its worth seeing for the grand effects but the story
isn&#x27;t very compelling or exciting.
