&#x22;To be chosen to join its ranks is the highest of honors and the
greatest of responsibilities. The ring never makes a mistake.&#x22;<br /><br />Green Lantern is a serviceable action superhero movie with a decent
cast, but the characters are so thin and underdeveloped that fans of
the comic are bound to be disappointed and newcomers won&#x27;t find many
reasons to care about what&#x27;s going on.<br /><br />There are a few good aspects to the movie. I enjoyed the scenes on Oa
and the time spent with the Green Lantern Corps, but that&#x27;s all too
brief. Mark Strong is great (as always), and a bigger role for his
character could make a potential sequel much better.&#xA0;<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds does his usual thing, which will probably please his
fans, but there&#x27;s really nothing to the character of Hal Jordan beyond
his flashbacks to his father. The same goes for Peter Sarsgaard, who is
basically wasted as Hector Hammond.<br /><br />If you feel like renting Green Lantern on a Friday night, go for it.
It&#x27;s not an awful movie, but it does nothing well enough to earn it a
place among the better superhero flicks. It&#x27;s two hours of &#x22;been there,
done that&#x22;. A movie about a character with galactic scope and the power
to make almost anything should have offered a lot of opportunities to
do some creative things, but mostly that potential goes unrealized.&#xA0;
