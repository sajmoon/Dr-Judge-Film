One of the worst superhero movies ever made. DC should stick to batman
and superman( even thought superman still needs a lot of work to). Hope
there isn&#x27;t a sequel. The costume was stupid along with the plot. Ryan
did not fit to the part very well and tried to make every conversation
in the movie into a joke. Saw it in 3-D and a lot of the scenes were so
dark that with the 3-D glasses on it was hard to make out some things
in the movie. The movie has no real pick up in it. Its about the same
pace all the way through and doesn&#x27;t get real exciting. I wont give
away any of the plot and such but its not worth seeing in theaters.
Wait tell it comes out on redbox, get it for a dollar and return it the
next day.
