Now I am a big Green Lantern fan. And I actually had low expectations
to this film. When I saw reviews for this my expectations were lowered
and when I finally saw the film, I liked it. It&#x27;s not as great as the
Dark Knight, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be. It&#x27;s WAY better than other DC
live action movies such as, Jonah Hex,Steel,The Spirit,Superman IV, and
Catwoman. Despite me liking it, I still have some problems with the
film.<br /><br />One of my problems being Parallax as the main villain, both we his
design and him being in the movie in general. Parallax is a bug-like
entity in the comics that possess people when they become afraid. Here
it&#x27;s done, but I think it was done to early and Hector Hammond
shouldn&#x27;t have been the one. And why is Parallax attacking Earth
instead of the entire universe? Second I have the same problem with
this movie as I do with the first transformers movie and that is too
much humans, not enough aliens. One of the reasons why I love the Green
Lantern comics is because I love seeing the aliens in the Green Lantern
Corps. They are very impressive to see in the movie and I wished they
focused more on Hal Jordan adapting into the Corps. Speaking of which
while I admit I kinda liked Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan, I still think
he was miscast.<br /><br />Reynolds fits more for Guy Gardner than Hal Jordan. Blake Lively while
hot she really didn&#x27;t have anything to contribute as Carol Ferris and I
wish they might&#x27;ve developed her character maybe if they make a sequel
she&#x27;ll become Star Sapphire. Now I really wished that Sinestro would be
the main villain. Mark Strong gave an awesome performance and it
would&#x27;ve been the next Heath Ledger&#x27;s Joker if they gave him more
screen time. I really wished that they show Sinestro&#x27;s fall from grace.
Where he becomes a renegade Green Lantern and tries to take over the
universe and the final battle would be Sinestro vs Hal.<br /><br />Now for the good parts. The special effects are awesome! And as I said
earlier the aliens look impressive and I wish they spent more time on
Oa than Earth. Tomar-re,Kilowog,Abin Sur and Sinestro all their actors
do a wonderful job and I know I keep repeating myself, but I really
wish they had more screen time. I actually thought the comedy was
pretty good. And I did like the final battle between Hal and Parallax.
Overall despite my complaints this is a very fun movie. It has good
action and I actually got into the story. I don&#x27;t know why critics hate
this movie. I&#x27;m guessing because of Thor they were expecting more.
Still if your a fan of comics I say check it out.
