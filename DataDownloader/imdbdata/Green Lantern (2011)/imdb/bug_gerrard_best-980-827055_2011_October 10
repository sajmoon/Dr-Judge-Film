&#x22;In brightest day, in blackest night. No evil shall escape my sight.
Let all who worship evil&#x27;s might. Beware my power, Green Lantern&#x27;s
light!&#x22; I think DC should throw the towel from their competition with
Marvel. It&#x27;s ironic maybe, when Marvel made an hottest preparation for
The Avenger, they just made an average summer film, it&#x27;s very
embarrassing. Come on, you should made the anticipation with something
equal, I mean Justice League.<br /><br />Green Lantern is not summer film at all. Flat story, stupid CGI, and
ridiculous characters. The 200 million of budget seems so wasted. I
hope Christopher Nolan will made an hotter competition next summer, The
Dark Knight Rises vs The Avenger. Sorry, if my review it&#x27;s too load
about DC reputation than the film itself!!
