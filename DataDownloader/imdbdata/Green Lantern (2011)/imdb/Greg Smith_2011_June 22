ONE LINE REVIEW: As far as super-hero movies go, it&#x27;s perfect. RATING:
See it in theaters (The rating system is one of &#x22;See it in theaters,&#x22;
&#x22;Wait for the Instant Download,&#x22; &#x22;Don&#x27;t waste your time&#x22;)<br /><br />SPOILER FREE<br /><br />I was really surprised. I&#x27;ve seen Ryan Reynolds in a handful of movies
and he keeps getting better. He is, sadly for me, one of those actors I
want to hate. He&#x27;s always the smart-alecky boy-who-never grew up (see
&#x22;Van Wilder&#x22;). But he keeps putting in the good performances (like &#x22;The
Proposal&#x22;) and I have to grudgingly accept him as a fine and diverse
player.<br /><br />&#x22;Green Lantern&#x22; starts out looking suspiciously like &#x22;Top Gun&#x22; with Hal
Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) upstaging his ex-girlfriend-pilot and two drone
fighter planes. Some of the same tactics were even used. Smart-alecky
Hal Jordan gets chewed out (because he was supposed to show how great
the drones were) and then is fired.<br /><br />Then he meets an alien who gives him a ring ... and we&#x27;re off. The rest
of the film is a pretty standard super hero journey: Hal Jordan becomes
super hero Green Lantern: he plays with the ring, rejects its super
powers and the responsibilities it requires, and ultimately makes peace
with the power and his role in the universe. That&#x27;s all pretty
straightforward fare.<br /><br />But where the film really works is how Hal&#x27;s human nature is unique in
the universe and is key to saving Earth and the universe. This is what
I really liked about the old Star Trek series. Exposing humanity&#x27;s
greatest weaknesses and 1) overcoming them or 2) turning them to our
greatest advantage. I was so pleasantly surprised that I forgave minor
errors in continuity and unclear plot turns.<br /><br />The movie pits &#x22;will&#x22; against &#x22;fear&#x22;. It is rare that Summer movies
have a moral or spiritual focus - a message you can take home. Hal
Jordan exposes his fear (a weakness we all share) and shows how he
combats it to save his woman, his planet, and the universe. And so, we
can all go home feeling like Hal Jordan, because we all feel fear - and
overcoming that fear is the super hero in each of us.
