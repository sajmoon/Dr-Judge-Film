Nothing special, at all, in this film. A bored linear thing that
anybody could predict from the trailer. I did expect the green lantern
&#x22;you are limited only by your imagination&#x22; idea to at least create some
beautiful special effects and some real comedy. But no, all they did
was bring forth weapons, cars and walls. I guess that&#x27;s all for the
imagination of the characters.<br /><br />The plot itself is that a human (oh, lowly human) is chosen by the ring
(that is never wrong) to defend the Universe. If this ring that feeds
on willpower is never wrong and there is an entire planet believing
that, it is effectively their god. Evil, on the other hand, feeding on
fear, doesn&#x27;t have the same belief system and thus, it is the enemy.<br /><br />In the end the human successfully uses plot elements fed to him by the
scriptwriters to trick the evil and win. Even Red Riding Hood is more
complex than that. So the bottom line is that I don&#x27;t recommend this to
anybody that wouldn&#x27;t read Red Riding Hood.
