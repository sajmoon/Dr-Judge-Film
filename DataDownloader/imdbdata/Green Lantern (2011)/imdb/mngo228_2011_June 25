Lots of people will say that the movie was a let down and wasn&#x27;t good
at all. This movie was epically awesome! Yes, they could have done more
as far as the rings power, but it was a good movie none the less. I
wish they had more of Blake Lively in there. Maybe her in a two piece
would have been nice.<br /><br />It was flashy and entertaining to watch, but most of all I liked its
presentation of the message it tried to deliver. Which is basically
even though you don&#x27;t see it, you can go as far as you allow yourself
to go. <br /><br />Also, be sure to stay after the credits. They show something
afterwards.
