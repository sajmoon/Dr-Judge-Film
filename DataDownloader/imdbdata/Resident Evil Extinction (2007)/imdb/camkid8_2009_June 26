I first saw this movie at a Redbox. There wasn&#x27;t anything else that
interested me so I thought to myself I enjoy a good horror movie, I
will try it out. I watched the movie the following night and I thought
to myself I picked out a good movie. The action was good and I liked
how these characters are just trying to survive. My favorite scene was
probably when they were fighting the super zombies. The main character,
Alice was an awesome heroine. She totally kicked butt. I hope they make
another Resident Evil movie in the series because this one was pretty
good. This movie is what got me into the Resident Evil games which are
just incredible.
