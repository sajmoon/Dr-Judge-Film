I should make clear the fact that I have yet to see the first and
second Resident Evils. The movie trilogy is based off the popular and
critically-acclaimed video game series, of which I am a foreigner to
also. So, this review is written by someone who has zero knowledge of
any previous story lines in the series. Everything I now know about
Resident Evil -it&#39;s characters, story lines, and everything else- is
based off of what I learned watching Extinction.<br /><br />With that being said, I thought Extinction was a very entertaining
movie. The story follows Alice (Jovovich), a genetically-enhanced woman
as she and a band of other remaining humans try to survive through
attacks from millions of zombies. Where did all the zombies come from?
In the first Resident Evil, the Umbrella Corporation let loose a deadly
virus that infects all people and, once the people are infected, turns
them into flesh-craving zombies. The infected aren&#39;t just humans
though- animals (including crows and dogs) are susceptible to the virus
and can thus be infected and changed into dangerous creatures. All this
begs the question: who on the decaying Earth can stop the paranoia?
Enter Alice, the woman who was genetically altered by the mad
scientists of the Umbrella Corp. Alice is essentially a super-human;
she can generate force fields and has ridiculous strength. After
avoiding all human contact, Alice eventually runs into the group of
people who are doing their best to survive but could obviously use some
help. With most of their attempts failing and time running out, the
group (somehow) learns that Alaska is the only safe zone left on the
planet. They can only get there once they pass through Las Vegas (I
don&#39;t get it either). However, they get sidetracked and end up in some
pretty intense fights with the living dead.<br /><br />These fights are sporadic but pick up towards the end of the movie.
They are really intense, and the zombies on the receiving ends of the
attacks are absolutely destroyed. Blood spurts and flies as bullets
pierce heads, arms, limbs, etc. While her crew doesn&#39;t add much to the
fights, you best believe Alice does her part: she is a complete bad ass
slashing through zombies with that piercing stare from her ice-cold
blue eyes. Classic lead females Ellen Ripley and The Bride came to mind
as I watched Alice. In a recent IMDb.com poll with 21,683 votes, users
were asked to vote on which female (Ripley, Alice, or Sarah Conner)
they would most want to protect them. Ripley won with 39% of the vote,
but second place went to Alice, with 22%. As you can see, I&#39;m not her
only fan.<br /><br />You&#39;ll notice I&#39;m not talking about the supporting cast. Well, to be
honest, there isn&#39;t much to say about them: they add little to the
story and have very generic roles. They come off more as enhancer
talent for Alice.<br /><br />I plan on renting the first two in the series now so I can more
thoroughly understand the series. I liked the ideas and the action, and
especially the lead heroine. Extinction was rough around the edges, but
at it&#39;s core was a solid movie which was loads of fun to watch.<br /><br />Good) Jovovich owns the movie as Alice, very intense action sequences
Bad) story is all over the map, supporting cast offers little to
nothing
