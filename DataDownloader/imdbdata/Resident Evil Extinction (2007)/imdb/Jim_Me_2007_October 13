Not the best in the series, it sort of plays like the second one but
not as much fun because it&#x27;s not as new. You know now that I think
about it&#x27;s just like the previous Resident evil but in a Mad Max
atmosphere. There are some horror flicks this movie borrows from that I
don&#x27;t care to mention. Also there are quiet A few predictable deaths,
that didn&#x27;t bother me because they weren&#x27;t on screen long enough to
care if they lived or not. The movie has some tie-ins to the game
series (duh), which as a fan of the game series myself, could have done
without. The action parts are definitely the best in the series. If
you&#x27;re new to the movie franchise and want to see a twist on some
zombie action this you&#x27;ll want to check out.
