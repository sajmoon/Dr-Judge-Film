The world really didn&#39;t need another Resident Evil movie, the previous
outings where in no way great, indeed the second installment was for
the most part god damn awful. This the third (and please studio execs
final) in the series feels dull and very repetitive, the feeling of
deja vu is prominent and seeing as the initial parts were pretty poor
thats in no way a good thing. Milla Jovovich is the kind of actress who
looks great but simply should quit and become a full time model. It&#39;s
shocking how dodgy her performance is here, all wooden stares and wrist
flicking knife action. The character was never sympathetic but Jovovich
hasn&#39;t managed to inject any 3-D aspects into the character, which
considering it&#39;s over three pictures is a bad show. I enjoyed some of
the action, indeed one particular sequence which a the viewer will
revel in, but altogether the director of Highlander brings the same
bland tricks and turns we see in every video game movie, however the
picture is pretty short ensuring it&#39;s game over pretty quick.
