It was obvious to everyone that we were going to see this movie based
on the end of the second one, Im not going to spill any spoilers on the
plot or there lack of it but we are left wide open for a fourth
instalment of this series. In all honesty if you have and respect for
the series I would leave it at the second chapter, this movie really
doesn&#39;t have any proper plot line and I was left feeling rather baffled
at what Id just spent the last hour and twenty five minutes doing, my
time would have just as well been spent at the toilet through this
movie.<br /><br />Other than the key fact of Alice, Umbrella and Zombies this is as much
as your going to get in way of a tie to the other movies, you find
nothing more out in this than you knew from the second. Granted the
action and special effects are sweet, there&#39;s a few good scenes that I
enjoyed watching but that doesn&#39;t make for a good movie.<br /><br />Advice: See what else is running and only see it if your a die hard
fan, but even then I think some may leave feeling no value for money.
