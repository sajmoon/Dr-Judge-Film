OK so i was hoping to see black sheep at the cinema with some mates.
When i got on the train I met my movie loving friends but they told me
angrily it was not on. They then said the only other film that looks OK
that is on is resident evil extinction i had only seen number 1 and
this was the third so i was thinking i would&#39;not understand the movie
at all but in actually fact it had a very easy to understand story.
Packed full of over the top violence and lots of gore with fantastic
acting (particularly by Milla Jovovich). This film is guaranteed to
make you jump out of your seat. The film also like the others made you
feel very attached to Alice (Milla Jovovich) and the rest of the
characters. Overall if you love Zombies and lots of violence this is
the film for you!
