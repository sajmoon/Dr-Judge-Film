Resident Evil: Extinction, like the previous two, is more of an action
movie than a zombie movie. Really, the way they pick off zombies is a
lot like the way Rambo kills commies. That being said, the action
scenes are decent.<br /><br />This movie also gets points for an attempt at originality. I&#39;m talking
about the &quot;zombie birds&quot; - I&#39;ve never seen that before. However, it
ended up seeming silly, and, more than anything, they just swiped the
entire scene&#39;s execution from the Hitchcock movie &quot;The Birds.&quot; The plot
was poor and lacking, and they wasted a bunch of time on characters who
went nowhere. Out the 90 minutes of this film, you could probably cut
an hour and the plot would be completely unaffected.<br /><br />The only reason to see this film is if you&#39;ve already seen the first
two and are curious to see where the story is going. Although, don&#39;t
expect any fulfilling conclusions because they leave the ending open
for another sequel.
