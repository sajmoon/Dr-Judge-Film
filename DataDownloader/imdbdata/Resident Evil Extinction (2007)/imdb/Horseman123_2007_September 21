I would have to stay that Resident Evil: Extinction is officially the
best out of the entire trilogy. Many factors contributed to this one of
them being the storyline.<br /><br />Although the storyline could use some improvement I thought it was a
major progress compared to Apocalypse and the first RE film. The movie
added more elements such as romance, the loss of a loved one, as well
as friendship.<br /><br />The movie takes itself much more seriously than the previous
installment and definitely meets your expectations.<br /><br />The visual effects are great and one of the high lights of the movie
was the Crow Scene. I would really recommend people seeing this movie
in theaters.<br /><br />The actors were well chosen and all acted their parts perfectly. All
even down to the minor actors and actresses who did a very good job of
acting their part. Milla Jovovich really put a tremendous performance
as Alice this time around outdoing her two performances in the last two
movies.<br /><br />I really recommend everyone to catch this movie in theatres. You WONT
be disappointed.
