Sometimes you can nitpick a movie to death and not really say anything
useful. I particularly am distressed when one compares a movie to a
book or a video game. A movie may be based on a book or movie, but it
stands alone.<br /><br />I watch some movies for intellectual stimulation, some for physical
stimulation, some just to have a good laugh, and some just to be
entertained without a lot of effort on my part. This movie fits that
last motive perfectly.<br /><br />It&#39;s sole purpose is to entertain and it did that well. There really
wasn&#39;t a lot of story here; just enough to frame the battles with the
zombies and those freaking birds! The mutant doctor was really good and
Milla Jovovich is always a pleasure to watch. The addition of Ashanti
got my pulse racing, too. Hey, the gals can take about the hot guys;
I&#39;m not interested.<br /><br />Pop some corn, sit back and be entertained.
