Despite the fact that this movie is based on a video game, in truth
nothing works in this film, or whatever you may call &quot;it&quot;. Why make a
movie based on a video game when the storyline and plot works just fine
on the small screen? Face it; RE1 and 2 sucked, BIG TIME. The special
effects and the setting is great(bombed-out deserted Las Vegas, great
idea) but what&#39;s the point if there&#39;s no solid foundation to work from?
The script is filled with so much cheese and plain flat &quot;acting&quot; that I
cared very little about the characters or the story for that matter.
And since when did the main character ever lept up in the air to kick a
zombie in the face? I&#39;ve never played the Resident Evil games(though I
plan on doing so since I&#39;m new to the franchise) but for those who did
this is a direct contradiction of the games where the focus is on
gunplay and puzzle solving. Never once do the characters display any
sense of brainpower that the characters in the games did. In the end,
they just blow the zombies away in typical B-movie fashion.<br /><br />I&#39;m tired of Hollywood. No really I AM!!! Someone PLEASE end these
soulless heaps of garbage before the movie industry as a whole becomes
a lost art.
