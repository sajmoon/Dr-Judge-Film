Any true fan of resident evil will have to admit that the directors of
these pathetic movies didn&#39;t take much consideration of the games. All
they had to do was simply go by the games and they could have endless
greatness. However like Hollywood does it screws up a good thing. This
film was pathetic in my opinion. This story has no substance at all to
me. The dialogue is horrific and the actors are horrible. There are so
many jacked up parts in this movie. There ends up being some hybrid
zombies that are a lot like the ones on 28 days later. They&#39;re super
quick and very aggressive. If this movie would&#39;ve been made in the 80&#39;s
with a pitiful budget then they might be able to get away with it but
the fact is the budgets there so why pick up crappy actors. I mean come
on they got the dude that played johnny cage in mortal combat. Then you
have ashanti with her masterpiece of a dialogue......she was pathetic.
All in all this movie is cheesy and down right retarded. The
ending.....oh boy the ending. It was so stupid and will make you
say...give me a break. This film is not even a renter in my opinion.
Don&#39;t waste your time on this one trust me
