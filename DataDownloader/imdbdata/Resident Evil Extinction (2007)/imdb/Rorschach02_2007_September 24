I went to see this with little expectations. It is, after all, Resident
Evil. From the trailer, they make it look like there will be some crazy
Zombie action in Vegas. No. Don&#39;t believe it. Little use is made of
Vegas at all. No, that might have made an interesting setting. And
since the Resident Evil makers want to stick to their &quot;We Shall Make
Sucky Films&quot; policy, the majority of the film is set in a sprawling
desert, sometimes flowing with sand and sometimes composed entirely of
CG.<br /><br />The special effects are decent, but the incredible lack of story. It
was like they were holding back every time the script started to get
exciting. An hour into the movie I was crushing popcorn on the littered
floor to amuse myself.<br /><br />The ending was extremely anti-climactic. You spend the entire movie
watching your heroine kick zombies to high heaven and then the final
battle was ridiculously lame. Not to mention that somehow, a single
zombie managed to paint all the walls with dripping blood. Gallons and
gallons of blood were all over every wall. It looked like the scene of
a Dick Cheney hunting excursion.<br /><br />I will probably never see this movie again. It definitely wasn&#39;t any
good, and it wasn&#39;t horrible enough to amuse me. So this is a lose-lose
situation. It definitely won&#39;t garner any academy awards, unless they
come up with the new category of &quot;Best Nudity While Floating in a
Womb-Like Bubble&quot;.<br /><br />Don&#39;t waste your money.
