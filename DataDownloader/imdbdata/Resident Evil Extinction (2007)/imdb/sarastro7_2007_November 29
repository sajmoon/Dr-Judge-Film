Sure, this movie could have been worse - if all the actors had had
brown paper bags over their heads.<br /><br />I went into this movie thinking that it couldn&#39;t possibly be worse than
the idiotically meaningless RE: Apocalypse, but lo and behold,
Hollywood foiled me once again by producing something so craptacular
that it exceeded even my saddest expectations.<br /><br />This movie is a failure on all levels. It is incoherent, nonsensical,
boring, meaningless, unexciting, tedious, stupid, moronic, and just
plain utterly deadbeat. There is no proper story of any kind, no
characterization that makes the least bit of sense, and to top it off
they go and retouch beautiful Milla&#39;s face, as if she didn&#39;t look good
enough alfreakin&#39;ready. The sheer dumbness of this production is just
off the scale. Complete trash, waste of celluloid, time and people.<br /><br />And that&#39;s the best I can say.<br /><br />Spoilers? This entire movie is a spoiler. A spoiler of life and time.
Avoid like the plague. &#39;Tis the reign of resplendent incompetence.<br /><br />I have given a name to my pain, and it is Resident Evil: Extinction.
