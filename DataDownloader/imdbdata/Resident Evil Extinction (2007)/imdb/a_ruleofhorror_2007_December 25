Oh my god!! I can&#39;t believe that Resident Evil: Extinction (RE:E) was a
waste of time! It said that RE:E is actually based on Resident Evil
Code: Veronica X (Video Game).<br /><br />I played that game before and I don&#39;t think that the movie is actually
based by it (i don&#39;t know if any of you guys notice the similarity
between RE:E and RE Code: Veronica X). But there is some moments of the
movie that I don&#39;t quite understand. Why is Alice left alone? Where is
Jill and Angie (From RE: Apocalypse)? How did they ended up in Nevada
Dessert? How did Carlos and L.J ended up with Claire? And why Claire
never mentioned her brother, Chris, in the movie? Isn&#39;t Chris is a main
character in the game? I was really disappointed with this one..i
waited 3 years for it! And i wasted RM11 (11 Ringgit Malaysia) to
watched it on the cinema..but what I know is that, they are going to do
the 4th one in Tokyo..and I don&#39;t have a clue who the main character
(besides Alice) for the 4th one is..but I&#39;m sure hoping it was Jill
Valentine ( to continue her journey)..or even Chris Redfield..or even,
the one that I love the most, Leon S. Kennedy.<br /><br />I think, with all the installments, it would be easier if they just
make a TV Series for it..because if they want to make the movie version
as real as the game version, it would take like around 8 or 10
installments..they haven&#39;t introduce Chris Redfield, Leon S. Kennedy,
Ada Wong, Barry Burton, Ark Thompson, Bruce McGivern, Kevin Ryman, Mark
Wilkins, Cindy Lenox, etc, in the movie yet..<br /><br />What I&#39;m trying to say is, that the 3rd installment was a disaster. The
1st one it was really good, the 2nd is okay..but the 3rd..the worst
installment ever..but, what I was really hoping that, the FINAL
installment for the movie, all the main characters/survivors joining
forces together and stop Umbrella Corporation once and for all!
