Yes, this movie to me was very good and action packed. However, I am
not a movie critic just an average guy that likes to see loads of head
shot action. If I were a movie critic I would probably say it was not
very good. I was impressed that they picked up from the last one, as
they did not seem to forget plot points I thought they might have from
part two. The only thing missing were the little girl survivor from the
last movie along with the Jill Valentine character (which made me a bit
sad). Still, one could just figure they died along the way so their
absence by no means hindered the plot. So what is the plot, the world
is overrun by the undead, infected by Umbrella&#39;s t-virus. Umbrella
still exists, still experimenting for the good of themselves.
Survivor&#39;s roam the lands, some by themselves...Alice for example, some
as tightly knit roving communities on wheels that include a couple of
familiar faces from part two, and then there are rednecks, who are
idiots that deserve what Alice does to em. Alice meets up with her old
friend and the caravan and plot a course towards possible salvation,
meanwhile an Umbrella scientist once again locks in on her and needs a
blood sample. Yes, this movie has loads of zombies and other nasty
creatures and it has lots and lots of action. From an undead crow
attack, to a Las Vegas zombie attack to a final showdown in one of
Umbrella&#39;s hive facilities. This movie was very good and if this is the
last one it ends on a good note in my opinion.
