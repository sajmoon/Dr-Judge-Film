I was really not expecting that much from this movie - I just expected
a followup to the previous ones. Especially since the producers hid the
movie from the press, a move I can really not understand now, and since
the last movie of Milla Jovovich, Ultraviolet, got horrible press and
never was shown in any theater near me at all.<br /><br />But I have to say this movie exceeded my expectations and turned out to
be really suspenseful and full of atmosphere, and overall a lot better
than the previous one. Milla Jovovich is cooler than ever. The story is
a lot more straightforward as well, and the action and fights could
have been hardly better. Like all good action movies, it also contained
humor, which, in this case, was rather black.<br /><br />It was however a bit sad that you had to know the previous movies to
really understand this one and to fully comprehend all story twists,
and I missed a bit the link between the last movie and this one.<br /><br />Its a good straightforward action movie, I can only recommend it.
