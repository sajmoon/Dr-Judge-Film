&quot;Resident Evil: Extinction&quot; is indeed a very good movie. I&#39;ve never
played any of the games, nor have I even seen the two preceding
movies...but I like this movie for what it is: One kicka*s, Zombie
Shoot &#39;Em Up action/horror flick. Our heroine here, Alice, is played by
Milla Jovovich. Jovovich is one of the hottest actresses out there, in
my opinion. She&#39;s also remarkably beautiful. I loved her looks in &quot;The
Fifth Element,&quot; and, oddly, ten years later, I love her even more.
Alice is a great killer on all levels, and could undoubtedly give that
inferior Laura Croft the beating of her life. Anyway, yes: I really
enjoyed this movie, and will soon be buying the other two on DVD. Since
I have not seen the original two, obviously, I couldn&#39;t grasp the story
100 percent...nevertheless, I had a blast. There&#39;s a lot of fun scenes
in here. Especially a Hitchockesque sequence involving vultures that
were infected by the Virus by chewing infected corpses taunting and
harming our heroes.<br /><br />There&#39;s something I want to ask you pathetic fanboys/fangirls who
despise this movie so much: What the hell did you expect? It&#39;s a fun,
entertaining, zombie movie, nothing more, nothing less. What the hell
did you folks except? Shakspeare with Zombies? I don&#39;t know. Some
people are just impossible to please, I guess.<br /><br />3 stars.
