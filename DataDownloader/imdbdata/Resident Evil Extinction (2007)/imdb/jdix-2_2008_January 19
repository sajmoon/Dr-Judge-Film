2008_January 19 
As a big fan of Milla Jovovich and Resident Evil, I can only thank Ms.
Jovovich for making something out of an otherwise boring movie by
adding some class to what amounts to a badly written, poorly plotted,
and otherwise wasted 95 minutes of yawn-yawn. Oded Fehr, Ali Larter,
Iain Glen, Ashanti and others add a semblance of professionalism which
is unfortunately overcome by stale lines, silly mid-plots, and missing
links. Try hard as they did, their efforts were buried by B-style
directing and production but did bring my vote up from a 2 to a 3.<br /><br />Director Russell Mulcahy and Writer Paul W.S. Anderson would do well to
remember just what it was that made 1 and 2 stand out amongst all the
other Action / Horror / Sci-Fi / Thrillers of the day. If they colude
for RE4, I hope they don&#39;t ever again depend on cast and crew to rescue
their poor work. If there is an Oscar for actors who survive against
all odds, it should go to this cast who each deserve a 10 - but the
movie gets a 3/10.<br /><br />Resident Evil 4 - bring it on and do it right - in the tradition of 1
and 2.
