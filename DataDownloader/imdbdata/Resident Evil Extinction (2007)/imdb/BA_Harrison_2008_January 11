In Extinction, the third instalment of the Resident Evil series, the
deadly T-Virus has escaped the confines of Raccoon City and
contaminated the rest of the world. Zombies now outnumber the living
and, as the number of survivors on the planet&#39;s surface gradually
dwindles, Umbrella Corp experts deep beneath the Nevada desert attempt
to perfect an anti-virus.<br /><br />Meanwhile, genetically enhanced zombie-killing babe Project Alice
(Milla Jovovich) travels the country searching for other uninfected
humans.<br /><br />Sporting the latest in sexy post-apocalyptic desert-wear (which
naturally includes stockings and suspenders), the drop-dead-gorgeous,
high-kicking, gun slinging, slayer of the undead cuts a swathe through
legions of shambling corpses (and zombie crows!), rescuing a rag-tag
convoy of demoralised people in the process.<br /><br />Alice convinces their leader, Claire Redfield (Heroes hottie Ali
Larter), to lead her convoy to Alaska, where she believes they will be
safe from contamination. But first they must head for Las Vegas, where
they hope to find enough fuel to last the journey North.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nasty Umbrella Corp scientist Dr. Isaacs, who has been
tracking Alice via satellite, has a nasty surprise in store for our
heroine and her new pals when they eventually reach Vegas: he&#39;s
prepared a container full of extremely nasty zombies to greet them!<br /><br />Helmed by hit-and-miss director Russell Mulcahy, and written by the
equally unreliable Paul W.S. Anderson, Resident Evil: Extinction could
have gone either way. I am pleased to report, however, that the guys
were on form with this film, and deliver a hugely enjoyable and
visually impressive sci-fi/horror yarn that, despite being rather
derivative (Day of the Dead, anyone?) and occasionally a little too
silly (Alice&#39;s telekinesis), is packed with enough action (great
stunts, explosions, crashes), gore (juicy zombie bites, knife attacks,
bullets in the head), and scares (yes, I admit that I jumped) to
guarantee horror fans a good time.<br /><br />7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.
