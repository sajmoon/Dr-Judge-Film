Resident Evil, part 3. The story continues so it would be a good idea
to watch the other two as well before seeing this one otherwise some
things will be missed. So where are we now? Alice is roaming the Earth,
the T-virus has escaped from the laboratory, and survivors are on the
run. Oh, and not to forget, Umbrella Corporation is chasing Alice. So,
all in all, more of the same.<br /><br />When I was watching this film I was more than once reminded of the Mad
Max series and some other post-apocalypse films but not in an entirely
bad way. The start of the film is a wee bit slow and there are a few
odd bits in there that don&#39;t exactly match up with the previous two
films, but the complete set is pretty much OK, apart from the slow
start.<br /><br />The ending gives a good reason for a part 4 to be made and if it does
get made I will be seeing it. This film could have been better, but it
was a worthy watch as it is, if you liked the first two that is.
Personally I loved the soundtrack, it matches the film very well.
Especially the song that plays when the ending credits start.<br /><br />Good enough, 7 out of 10 shooter up games made into film
