Now i don&#39;t give long rambling reviews on films, i don&#39;t drone on about
their effects, casting, writing or directing. I could for this film,
the effects were great, simple, believable and effective. The casting
was meticulous, (specifically the gorgeous Milla Jovovich). Basic
writing and decent directing.<br /><br />However i feel the main issue with Resident Evil, is that the plots are
becoming rather stale, take this one, Predictable end and action
scenes. I will give credit for the opening scenes, they did grab my
attention, however i feel the film would of lost my interest if Milla
Jovovich wasn&#39;t kicking ass in shorts.<br /><br />Basically the film is relying on the simple format that is zombie
films, Girls, Guns, Guts and Gore. But this system has made good films
in the past and so probably will for Resident Evil.<br /><br />Obviously we can expect another, following the same typical ideas that
conclude all Zombie-like films. Hopefully it will have a more
interesting plot. I found this film to be worth viewing, but not twice,
its good for a spare evening and especially if you&#39;ve seen the others.<br /><br />Overall, quality, easy on the eyes, action is all anybody wants from a
zombie film, and this delivers it perfectly. Worth Watching
