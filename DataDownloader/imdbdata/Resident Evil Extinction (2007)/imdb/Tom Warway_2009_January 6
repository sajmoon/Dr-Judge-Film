I like zombie films. In fact, I love zombie films. So, naturally , when
Resident Evil: Extinction came out, I immediately went to the local
cinema and watched it. I wasn&#39;t expecting anything great -- I had
anticipated the unwelcome development of the &#39;Alice&#39; storyline since
watching Resident Evil: Apocalypse -- but I wasn&#39;t expecting anything
this bad. Here&#39;s why this film sucks: 1) The zombies are not at all
scary; the make-up and choreography is appalling. 2) The &#39;Alice&#39;
storyline is f*cking ridiculous -- Milla Jovovich has become some sort
of superhero (and has had some weird airbrushing effects done to her).
3) The plot has become boring. Not terrible, not some huge
abomination... just boring. There&#39;s no development or anything. For
those of you considering watching this: don&#39;t. Go watch a proper zombie
flick, like Dawn of the Dead (either version) or 28 Days/Weeks Later.
