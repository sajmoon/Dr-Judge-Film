One thing that&#39;s for sure is that the &quot;evil&quot; of the title is becoming
less and less &quot;residential.&quot; This time around the nasty T-virus has
spread all over the whole world and humanity is in grave danger. I
guess that&#39;s where the &quot;extinction&quot; part comes in.<br /><br />Once again we find ourselves not too long after the previous film left
off. Humanity is in shambles and &quot;Extinction&quot; plays itself like a
post-apocalyptic thriller, no pun intended. Alice is evading the evil
Umbrella Corporation who needs to conclude some experiments but they
can only do it with her blood and clones don&#39;t work. While wandering
the desert Alice finds out she has mental powers, meets a group of
survivors, and happens to be tracked by Umbrella all within what must
be one hour. I guess it&#39;s not her lucky day. The audience however,
providing you&#39;re fans of stylized carnage, is in for a little treat.
&quot;Extinction&quot; not only provides a more interesting plot than the
previous film, it also provides much better action and special effects.
These effects feature zombies (naturally) but also demonic crows and a
nasty mutation at the end. The action scenes are nicely done with
somewhat unpredictable approach to who gets munched and who doesn&#39;t so
tension is there throughout.<br /><br />There are also many absurdities, but they can only be expected in a
film like this. For instance, the film is set in a desolate world with
supposedly little supplies yet the women look like they put on make up
every morning and regularly get a manicure. The GOOD women that is.
Alice meets some BAD people in the beginning and these people somehow
haven&#39;t picked up any of those bathroom supplies and make up kits that
are laying around. Those bad people are another thing, they appear in
an early scene that demonstrates that Alice can fight and kick ass...
seeing that this is the third movie in the series do they really need
to make this point again? If they avoided it, then the climatic fight
might have been longer and a bit more, you know, climatic. But I guess
that wasn&#39;t the point of that fight since right after it we are set up
for Resident Evil 4.<br /><br />&quot;Extinction&quot; is enjoyable for what it is, but that&#39;s it. --- 6/10<br /><br />Rated R for violence/gore and horror. Ages 13+
