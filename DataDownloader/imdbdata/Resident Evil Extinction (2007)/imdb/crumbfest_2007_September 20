That was what i didn&#39;t like most about the first two terrible but fun
adaptations but the third film Extinction shows a lot of survival
horror and combines it with pulse pounding action and the supreme
hotness of Milla Jovovich. The best thing about Extinction is that it
is as close to the games as Paul WS Anderson is going to get but most
of the kudos goes to director Russel Mulachy who clearly has a better
understanding of the games and uses a lot of similar game elements to
create scary and suspenseful scenes. Of course this is a Paul WS
Anderson movie and you can tell by the writing because of the few but
noticeable cheesy lines and the complicated and confusing plot but
Mulachy makes it seem OK with his vision of Andersons movie. Visually
the sets are awesome very desert like very apocalyptic i was totally
impressed. The special effects light up the screen and Milla Jovovich
steals the show and although she was never in the games she&#39;s as bad@$$
as Claire, Jill, or Leon are. As a stand alone movie it&#39;s every bit as
great a popcorn movie as Spider-Man or Pirates Of The Carribbean cool
story lots of action, some funny humor, it&#39;s fantastic high budget
nonsense at it&#39;s most entertaining state. If you didn&#39;t like the first
two still chance it with this one because it&#39;s a much different
interpretation more horror, more jump scares, and more gory action
packed thrills. Extinction is by far the best out of all three and has
the most amazing looking zombies that are pretty hard to one up the
only movie i can think of may be 28 Weeks Later but even still the make
up gives the zombies a very Hills Have Eyes look which i find very
cool. The crows are neat and i&#39;m glad they added them because the whole
scene worked well creating intensity and just that kick@$$ environment
you want in this kind of movie. In closing i think Resident Evil:
Extinction is the best of the series, the best choice for this weekend,
and the most entertaining and fulfilling ride of the year of the
threequels.
