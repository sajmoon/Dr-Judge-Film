So the &quot;Resident Evil&quot;-movies have reached the trilogy-mark. Apparently
the first movie trilogy based on a video game. I have to question if
this is something admirable or not. The first two movies were mediocre
at best, and this third installment is no exception.<br /><br />First of all the story (if it matters). The world has been completely
destroyed by the virus, almost all humans are zombies and the whole
ecosystem has failed because of the virus. Basically the world has been
turned into one giant desert. In this wasteland a few human survivors
roam, among them Alice (Jovovich). Meanwhile The Umbrella Corporation
has continued their research.<br /><br />First of all i can say that this is probably the best-looking of the
three movies. The sets are very nice and the world does feel desolate.
But mostly the positive comments end there. Like in previous movies,
the action scenes are the major problem i have with the movie. I don&#39;t
understand what&#39;s so hard about making decent action scenes. Here we
have crappy choreography, boring fights and firefights that look like
people are just running around shooting randomly. There is a lot of
blood and gore (obviously), but not even that manages to spice things
up. I wouldn&#39;t go as far as calling the movie boring, but the more
quiet moments in the movie are actually the ones that work best. And
for an action movie, that&#39;s not a very positive remark.<br /><br />What surprises me most about this movie is that they let Russell
Mulcahy direct. There are a few directors in the industry that i wonder
why people hire, Mulcahy is definitely one of those. Incidentally, so
is the even-worse Paul W.S. Anderson. If you look at Mulcahy&#39;s track
record, there is very little (if anything) to be impressed of. He has
churned out almost exclusively crappy movies. And you can also see that
in the last few years he&#39;s mostly had to settle for directing TV. Why
they would hire him for this movie is impossible to understand. But i
guess that it&#39;s yet another sign that the bar is not raised very high
when making a Resident Evil-movie...<br /><br />In the end i found this to be about as enjoyable as the first two
movies. That is: not very. It&#39;s not utter crap, but it&#39;s still light
years away from better action movies. The problem nowadays is that
there are other zombie-movies being made that are so much better than
these. &quot;28 Days Later&quot;, &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; and &quot;28 Weeks Later&quot; for
that matter, have raised the bar for the genre. Resident Evil doesn&#39;t
even try to catch up. Which is kind of sad. I rate this 3/10.
