I normally don&#39;t write negative reviews, but having watched the two
first Resident Evil movies this must have been one of the biggest
disappointments in a long time. To be honest, the franchise is pretty
embarrassing overall, but this just about sums up what a crap movie
should contain; lack of story, ridiculous &quot;zombies&quot; and a worn-out hero
that merely plays on her admittedly physical appearance. The acting is
awful, the &quot;professor-turned-super villain/mutated monster&quot; is
laughable and the whole fight in the dessert feels terribly worn out.<br /><br />If RE:Extinction is an indicator of what &quot;science fiction&quot; film
investors are willing to depart with their capital for, we have a bleak
future ahead of us! This is no science fiction, just cheap horror for
the masses. I sincerely hope that they discontinue the franchise and
turn the ship around quickly.
