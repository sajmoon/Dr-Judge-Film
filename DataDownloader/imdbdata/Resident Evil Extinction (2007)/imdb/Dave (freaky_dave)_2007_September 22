None of the Resident Evil films have been great. Part 1 was interesting
and caught my attention, part 2 was boring with some nice scenes, but
nothing good enough to recommend. Now we have part 3. I would say the
third is somewhat better than the second movie, but not as good as the
first film.<br /><br />In the finale in the series, mankind is mostly extinct except for a few
survivors. Some of the survivors are living in the world and continue
to exist by not staying in one area for too long. Other survivors
include the last of the Umbrella Corporation which caused the T-virus
to escape in the first place. They live underground and continue to
plot how to continue living in a world over run by the undead. The
Umbrella group&#39;s plan is to control the undead and train them in ways
that will domesticate them and make them easily controlled, but to hell
with the human survivors. This is something I don&#39;t understand. Why try
to domesticate flesh craving zombies? Why not help the human survivors
to extinguish the zombies once and for all and try to start a new
world? That&#39;s one problem with this movie.<br /><br />Alice (Milla Jovovich in the role for the third time in the series)is
the wild card. She wants to wipe out the zombies and help the human
survivors, and now she has psionic powers to go with her fighting
skills. She can suddenly create forcefields as well, but never seems to
use these powers as she should. With her powers, she should be able to
rid the world of the zombies, but she instead uses her battling skills
with nasty blades and guns to kill them when using her powers would be
more effective. I know, she doesn&#39;t seem to have good control over the
new abilities, but you would think she would be willing to learn. After
all, these psionic powers would make it much easier and more effective
to deal with the zombie plaque, but then we wouldn&#39;t be able to see
blood spray as she chops off heads and other limbs. Sigh.<br /><br />The story is not real strong either, and the secondary characters are
never really given any depth whatsoever. The action is nice and there
are several shocks and surprises along the way, but it is never enough
to keep the flow of the almost nonexistent story moving along in an
interesting way. The story has something to do with heading to Alaska
which may still be free of the zombie plaque. However, it is never
given much thought.<br /><br />Overall, Resident Evil Extinction is slightly better than the second
film, but it still fails to match the first film. The story is weak and
the characters, with the exception of Alice whom we&#39;ve gotten to know
in the two films previously, are also flawed. Of course Ali Larter as
Claire, the leader of the band of survivors outside of Alice, offers
something interesting to the story, but it is never enough. We wonder
how she became this leader, but her story, like so much else in this
movie, is never explored. I recommended the first film just barely, but
I still cannot recommend this film even though it is slightly better
than the second film.
