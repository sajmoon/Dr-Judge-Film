Several years has passed... When the virus spread in Raccoon City,
which the city was overrun with Zombies and all sorts of Monsters. It
was an huge disaster in the city. But the virus went all over the world
and the world changed into one big desert. Which several city in the
world like Las Vegas, Nevada is nearly cover in sand. Like Food, Gas
and Water is very limited. Alice (Milla Jovovich) is still hiding from
the evil Umbrella Corporation and she travels alone to find an safe
place. She tries to stay away from her contacts to not endanger her
friends or herself. But the last time that Alice was with Umbrella
Corporation, they did some experimenting on her. Now Alice has certain
power in her that she doesn&#39;t quite understand how to use it or embrace
it. Alice&#39;s friends like Carlos (Oded Fehr) and L.J. (Mike Epps), along
with a group of survivors are trying to find an place. Where they could
live in peace and without fear. The leader of the group is Claire (Ali
Larter), who tries her best to find an haven for the group. While the
corrupted scientist Dr. Issacs (Iain Glen), who works for the Umbrella
Corporation tries to make the perfect Alice clone and trying to make
certain Zombies have a mind of their mind. But Dr. Issacs has other
plans for Alice, The Umbrella Corporation and himself.<br /><br />Directed by Russell Mulcahy (Highlander, Resurrection, The Shadow) made
an enjoyable Action/Horror/Sci-Fi/Adventure that improves over
&quot;Resident Evil:Apocalyspe&quot;. Which the 2004 sequel was an watchable
movie but in the end results... it was an mess, despite an good cast.
Now the third film is closer to Paul W.S. Anderson&#39;s original picture
but Mulcahy does have his own visual style as well. Anderson&#39;s
screenplay certainly gives visual homages to George Miller&#39;s Mad Max
Trilogy, Alfred Hitchcock&#39;s The Birds, George A. Romero&#39;s Day of the
Dead, the original Resident Evil movie and more. Although his
screenplay is quite flawed but it is clever and exciting at times. <br /><br />DVD has an clean anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good
Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an enjoyable commentary track
by the director and the producers, four featurettes and deleted scenes.
The last and third feature was an major international success. Critics
did certainly hated this film but it is fun to watch. But the best
thing in the picture is Jovovich, which she&#39;s in great shape in the
film and there&#39;s a few genuine surprises in store for the fans of the
&quot;Resident Evil&quot; movies. Despite some plot holes in the story, overall
&quot;Resident Evil:Extinction&quot; is entertaining and it should keep the fans
happy. Super 35. (*** &frac12;/*****).
