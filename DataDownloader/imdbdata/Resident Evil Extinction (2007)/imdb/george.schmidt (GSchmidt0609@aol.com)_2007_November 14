RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION (2007) **1/2 Milla Jovovich, Oded Fehr, Ali
Larter, Iain Glen, Ashanti, Christopher Egan, Spencer Locke, Matthew
Marsden, Linden Ashby, Jason O&#39;Mara, Mike Epps. Third chapter in the
ever popular video game adapted franchise this time with Jovovich&#39;s
apocalyptic heroine Alice fitted (to be tied) in a duster and roaming
the scorch- ridden wasteland of Las Vegas with a reunion of sorts with
Fehr &amp; Epps heading a convoy of refugees a la &quot;The Road Warrior&quot; in
hopes to find a new civilization while the ongoing zombie horde cum
viral outbreak by the nefarious &quot;Umbrella Organization&quot; &#150; led by
hiss-able Glen reprising his nasty, evil genius role again &#150; hell-bent
on cloning the ass-kicking Alice for their own exploitive means. Not
bad but ultimately a tad tedious retread but veteran director Russell
Mulcahy keeps the pyrotechnic gore fest on full throttle overload of
the senses.
