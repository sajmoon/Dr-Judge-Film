I haven&#39;t seen the two previous installments of this trilogy, nor have
I played the video game; it appears that I don&#39;t need to. While I
usually like gross movies, this one nearly stank. Gross movies have to
understand what kind of movies they are to be worth seeing
(&quot;Grindhouse&quot;). But movies like &quot;Resident Evil: Extinction&quot; pretend to
be important. Milla Jovovich is not making any kind of name for herself
if she stars in stuff like this.<br /><br />So, you&#39;ll do best to just avoid this one. There are far better movies
out there. Aside from Jovovich, Oded Fehr and Ashanti (to name a few)
probably wish to forget their participation in this.
