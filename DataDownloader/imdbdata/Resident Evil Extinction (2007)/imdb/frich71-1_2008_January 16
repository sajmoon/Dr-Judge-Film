There are certain characters I just like regardless of how bad the
movie actually might be. Alice is one of those characters. I just love
the idea of a mutant bad ast beauty who keeps getting stronger.<br /><br />The movie is actually more like a four or a five but Milla and her
portrayal of Alice earns the movie a better rating. Can&#39;t get enough.
Bring on RES 4: Showdown Below Tokyo.<br /><br />Was a little miffed that they brought back Mike Epps and Oded Fehr only
to kill the characters off. And what the hell was the deal with Ali
Larter&#39;s character being able to fly a helicopter? I don&#39;t mind it if
you at least throw in a one line monologue somewhere where she says &quot;I
used to be a helicopter pilot.&quot; But the average everyday person running
from flesh eating deadites probably wouldn&#39;t know how to fly a
helicopter.
