2008_January 6 
If nothing else, this movie will be a landmark in my film viewing life:
it was the first movie I ever saw on Blu Ray (a buddy bought a
Playstation 3). If not for that, I&#39;m sure it&#39;d be one for the dustbin
of my memory. Granted, it&#39;s hard to judge fairly when I never saw the
first two installments of this based-on-a-video game trilogy, but
Resident Evil: Extinction can only barely count as a movie. It&#39;s a
post-apocalyptic zombie movie where a genetically engineered woman with
excellent fighting abilities (model/musician Milla Jovovich &#150; I refuse
to acknowledge her as an actress) helps a ragtag band of survivors
escape to Alaska, while she herself infiltrates the underground layer
of the Umbrella Corporation, which created the virus that zombified the
rest of the world. The plot is mostly nonexistent. I kind of like the
set and costume designs (sci-fi being every set and costumer designer&#39;s
favorite gene), and the movie&#39;s watchable when it focuses on the
scenery. But it&#39;s an action movie, and, for God&#39;s sake, the action
sequences are dull. CGI looks even more fake in high definition. The
director and/or editor cut madly during these sequences, inducing
headaches and making it impossible for you to tell what&#39;s going on.
It&#39;s a pretty worthless film, and let&#39;s leave it at that.
