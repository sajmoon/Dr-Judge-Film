I have been waiting for the third part of Resident Evil for so long
that the very expectation has somehow overgrown the film itself. We had
it all in first two parts &#150; great, sexy, smashing Milla Jovovich; dead
men walking; suspense; special effects to the fore; always tense line
of plot&#133; And what did they offer us in the third and seemingly last
part? Milla is still very sexy, she looks great even with her
incredibly bad hairdos, she is sporty, strong and she fights like a
man. There are dead men aplenty, and there are pools of blood a lot.
The film starts not so convincingly and it goes a bit too slow and too
repeated some time. But then, when other heroes appear and the action
gets very tight, the film gets much better. Mind it, in today&#39;s realm
of 4-hours monsters, this part with its mere 90 minutes seems a short
condensed blast of pure energy. Maybe, there is not so much to think or
ponder about, but who cares? After all, Milla is true to the end. She
is cool, she may cry, she fights, she has a great physique, and yes,
yes, fans of her body, she does appear completely naked couple of
times. What else can be dreamed of? Jokes aside, the third part is a
good entertainer and it holds your attention all 90 minutes + and you
never regret you started watching it. The only question remains &#150; what
does the end mean? Will there be the Fourth part? After the Apocalypse
and Extinction, should we expect some Retaliation or, maybe, The Last
Judgment? I do not know. But if the next part is the same fast and
ferocious shot of naked energy (no pun intended), I would vote for
that.
