This film I feel goes to extremes in areas, while on one hand it is
extremely unlike the resident evil we all know, it is at times more
like the games than the first two. Examples, the world has ended more
or less and the Zombies have taken over the surface is very unlike the
games, but the film is full of things from the games, but used subtly
enough so as not to shove it in your face. The whole trapped obstacle
course at the beginning screams the games (while the set is different
the whole area rigged with deadly traps is very RE) The plot is driven
forth by finding documents/notebooks again very RE and the Umbrella Lab
looks brilliant, better than anything they designed in the games by
far. <br /><br />Now for the plot, it was very simple, but then the film would have
suffered from a very detailed plot, what was more important were the
characters which were far superior to the previous films, and I suspect
it has to do with Russel being appointed Director. Easily Anderson&#39;s
best writing to date for characters although it&#39;s punch scenes seem to
be a little less grand than the other films (the laser corridor in re
and the nemesis shootout with the STARS in re:a) and the biggest
disappointment was there were no monsters in the film apart from the
staple Dogs and Zombies, the crows, while cool don&#39;t count and the
Tyrant is only in it at the end. But that is more to do with budget
than the script.<br /><br />The acting was far better in this film, and for once the supporting
characters were well enough done for you to care about them or even
just get a sense that they are real people in a bad situation. Unlike
RE:A in which the main characters were planks and the support
characters basically were just warm props.<br /><br />The action scenes were done very well, although at the beginning there
is a little of the shot too close cut too fast syndrome but that evens
out in the later scenes. The gore was good, not over the top like some
rubbish zombie film but not as mild as the other RE films.<br /><br />The ending was a little off kilter, and lacked the big WHAM that
Anderson usually ends the RE films with, I think less would have been
more for this films ending, when you see it you will know what I mean.<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILER<br /><br />The Tyrant was not too bad, but he didn&#39;t really grab me by the balls.
I don&#39;t care if the Tyrant could still manage to talk a little, as
after all he is still in the early stages of mutation but since the
dialogue he did have was pretty cheesy and added nothing to the plot or
film I think it could have been left out.<br /><br />Over all, I think it is a very good film, and I hope a 4th is in the
works and they bring Russel back to direct.
