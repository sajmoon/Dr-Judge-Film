Okay in my opinion this movie was doomed from the git go with the
addition of Ashanti. Really RE needed a complete redesign scratch
Milla, Ashanti, keep the girl from heroes and the bus driver. Really it
would have been better to see just those two survive the movie. But I
can&#39;t say that I thought this movie was going to be good. I think I&#39;m
just really tired of hearing Milla Jovich talk like Liam Neeson all the
time. Its really annoying.<br /><br />Anyway if you&#39;re looking to kill some time on a Friday night and you
gotta decide between RE: EXTINCTION and HALLOWEEN make the right
choice. I know you can do it. :)
