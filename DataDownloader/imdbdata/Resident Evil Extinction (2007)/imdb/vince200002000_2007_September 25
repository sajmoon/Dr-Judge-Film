Resident Evil 3 is the best of the trilogy. Taking place a few years
after it&#39;s predecessor, it still tells the struggle of the T virus
epidemic. With the continuation of the T virus outbreak. The survivors
flee raccoon city and are headed to Alaska. However things start to get
rough when they reach the Navada desert. The entire nation is nearly
consumed by the deadly virus. Umbrella has a secret underground
laboratory and zombies are everywhere. This movie has a good
combination of action, as well as some good scares here and there. It
makes a good action and horror movie, that fans of the first two movies
will certainly enjoy watching. There was a great plot, great action,
great acting, great scares, this movie had it all, and did a good job
at delivering it all in one movie.
