2007_November 10 
When a man continually writes scenes in which his fianc&eacute;e appears
naked(if not seen fully nude, save for glimpses which many a teen boy
have undoubtedly paused and gone frame by frame to... admire; ah, the
wonders of the DVD format), is he &quot;sharing the wealth&quot;, or is he being
a pompous jerk, rubbing her looks in our faces? Mind you, even if that
particular fact does not make Anderson a jerk, there can easily be
found other reasons to thrust that title of dubious honor upon him...
in fact, I&#39;m quite sure there are plenty who use far more explicit and
visually descriptive phrases to describe the man. I don&#39;t know that I
dislike him; it&#39;s actually almost funny, what he does. He writes horror
that takes place in tight spaces, claustrophobic areas, he has
gratuitous gore, he fills his work with loud, noisy rock music, he does
action and horror with little respect for proper pacing or character
development, his scripts are thin as, ironically, paper, and holed like
Swiss cheese that&#39;s been attacked with a machine-gun, and last but not
least, he insists on surprising his audience, pulling the rug out from
underneath them, even though these surprises are at the expense of
sense and logic. In spite of all of this, he manages to keep getting
work. It&#39;s impressive, in an odd kind of way. And people do keep
watching his stuff, in spite of how he treats the source
material(before this franchise, there was Mortal Kombat, and he&#39;s also
done Alien Versus Predator, managing to mess up *two* franchises that
had good movies between them, well-done games made about them, and, so
I hear, comics of, yet again, notably high quality). But I digress.
Fear not, patient reader(as I&#39;m sure you must be, for still reading
this review), the introduction is over, and I will comment on the title
itself, now. First off, Jill and Angie are gone, without even a mention
of them. It&#39;s not even stated if they&#39;re dead or not. However, the very
ending of the second film, for any who have watched it, *is* followed
up on. The plot starts some time(every time I hear how long, it&#39;s a
different amount of years) after Apocalypse. There&#39;s a different feel
to some of it, with the characters much more mobile than in the first
two. The script is about as bad as that of the usual Anderson film, but
this still manages to be more entertaining and effective(if still not
powerful, involving or engaging) because of one thing... the direction.
With Witt of the second not in charge, and Anderson only writing,
having not directed one of these since the first, it actually manages
to rise... above the material? Possibly. It comes off as less obviously
flawed than the second, though that may be more a matter of
presentation than of content. With Valentine gone, another female known
from the games is brought in... namely Claire Redfield. She&#39;s portrayed
by Ali Larter, who does fine. Jovovich does fine again, albeit being
less of a bad-ass than she was when we last saw Alice. She does still
kick ass, and she&#39;s not the only one. The action varies, but some of it
is definitely cool. The camera and editing, with the few exceptions
where it confuses the viewer as to what&#39;s going on(which really doesn&#39;t
extend beyond an early and utterly useless scene), really does a good
job. Some of the action is really, really cool. In addition to Claire,
other characters are brought in, though few do anything. Spencer Locke
spends most of her on-screen time screaming or crying, with one of her
only lines regaling the tale of how she gained her silly name. Epps
stopped being funny at some point in-between the second movie and this
one. The violence and gore is surprisingly tame(and there&#39;s less nudity
and such), both for an R, and for an entry in this series. The make-up,
however, is back, helping us viewers put behind us the pitiful excuse
for not doing such, that was the presentation of the zombies in
Apocalypse. The effects, in general, are quite good. The story borrows
a bunch... from the first, in fact. Some bits are almost too close. The
film is in a rush, as the others, and wouldn&#39;t have been bad off were
it longer. The pace is intense. Near the ending, the movie gets too
busy setting up a sequel(what comes after extinction? Although, one
could have posed the same question just years ago, with &quot;apocalypse&quot;
being the word), when it should be trying to properly finish of this
one. The new monster, for my money, is great. The frights vary, some
are jump-scares. All in all, the film isn&#39;t bad, and definitely
delivers, if you liked the first two. The score has some hints to the
main theme of the first, which I personally thought was excellent. I
recommend this to any fan of the first two and of Anderson in general,
as well as the actors. If you liked either of the first two, I&#39;d say
give this one a chance. 7/10
