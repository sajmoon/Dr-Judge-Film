Oh dear. First they did RE1 a low production value attempt at turning a
genius game into an action movie. When compared with the games there
was very similarity, but as a movie it was decent, nothing special but
watchable, and Jovovich was a good casting choice.<br /><br />Then RE2, which seemed like more of an attempt to be like the game
bringing in Nemesis and making better game-plot references, but again
low production value, and still not that rich in plot, but the way it
ended definitely was intriguing.<br /><br />Then RE3, geez... Why did they decide to do a Mad Max meets Dawn of the
dead? Their only moments that even referenced to the older movies
(forget the games) were training scenarios, and flashbacks. There is
very little dialogue, and less of it that has any importance, there is
little plot, only build up plot for things that never happen, and I am
sure are build up for the next sequel which will continue from where
this leaves off.<br /><br />Instead of going further into plot and atmosphere, and realising what
made the games so amazing, they went further into Hollywood action and
gave up on plot and atmosphere entirely. I think it&#39;s safe to say, you
won&#39;t be missing much not seeing this or the next movie.
