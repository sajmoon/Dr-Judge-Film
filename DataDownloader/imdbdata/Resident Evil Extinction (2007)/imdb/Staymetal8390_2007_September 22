My friend and I have been playing this game forever, and the game has
brought us close and friends actually, so we are always stocked for a
Resident Evil movie, even after &quot;Apocalypse&quot; twisted and messed up the
game storyline, but this one ruined the game story at the end, which
I&#39;m not ruining.<br /><br />First off, Alice (Milla Jovovich) seems like dang Superwoman now, and
that&#39;s crap. Her fight sequences are always awesome, but when she&#39;s
shutdown, no undead attack her, which is odd and that&#39;s not all the
minor errors in her character which made me mad.<br /><br />Big disappointment for a Resident Evil in ways I must say. Las Vegas
isn&#39;t an option until halfway in the movie, when the trailer made it
seem that&#39;s where the whole movie is. Many plot holes in some ways like
what happened to characters like Jill, and when did they get gas (don&#39;t
ask).<br /><br />The movie&#39;s not horrible, but certainly not the best. The action
sequences are awesome, story quite weak, and minus Milla Jovovich&#39;s
character, they were good.
