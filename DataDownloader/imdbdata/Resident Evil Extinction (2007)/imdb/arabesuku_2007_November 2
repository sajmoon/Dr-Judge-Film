This movie was a lot better than I expected. Claire Redfield joining
the crew, another stunning performance from Jovovich and the strangest
twists and biggest explosions the series has seen yet.<br /><br />However - this should have been rated an &quot;18&quot; rather than a &quot;15&quot; in the
UK.<br /><br />It was very gory and very disturbing - the undead so far were not too
scary for me but this was more gory and disturbing than the Dawn of the
Dead remake and it frightened the hell out of me.<br /><br />A good movie - but be warned.<br /><br />8/10.
