2008_March 30 
I&#39;m not too sure what happened with this movie but I don&#39;t think it was
as good as the first one, and was equally as &#39;weird&#39; as the 2nd. I do
think that this trilogy is an example of what happens when a director
takes on a project and another director tries to do a sequel to it.<br /><br />It&#39;s the same story with the 2 remakes of The Hills Have Eyes. In that
case the guy who did the first apparently backed out of the 2nd one. In
the case of Resident Evil, it&#39;s pretty much the same story. Paul WS
Anderson did a pretty good job of the 1st movie, but the 2nd, directed
by someone else, wasn&#39;t nearly as entertaining.<br /><br />This one, the 3rd installment, proved to be borderline disaster,
especially with some of the dialog, was bad at times, survived only by
a few good scenes (death scene near the end with the red lasers). I
also noticed that the 3rd one took a few scenes from the original, and
I&#39;m not too sure if I liked that. <br /><br />Milla Jovovich looked stunning as normal, but now I am hoping she can
talk Paul WS Anderson into coming back for the 4th. I really liked the
last death in the movie where the zombie was sliced by the intertwined
lasers but that was one of the few bright spots. I really think that to
make Resident Evil Degeneration any better, you need the movies&#39;
original director, Paul WS Anderson. The other thing I liked about it
is the last couple camera shots tell you there is going to be a 4th.<br /><br />I find it hard not to get hooked on the story, though. I really thought
the 1st movie was good enough to buy the DVD but thought they took some
steps backwards with the 2nd and this one.
