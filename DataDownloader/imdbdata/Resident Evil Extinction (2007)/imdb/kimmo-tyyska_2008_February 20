2008_February 20 
The Extinction follows much of the same structure as earlier sequels;
the biovirus is out in the wild, zombies everywhere, Umbrella corp. Is
the trying to benefit from its disastrous deeds and Alice(Jovovich) is
developing overwhelming mutational skills. Comparing to earlier sequels
this one is more like the first part, less humorous and action movie
style than Apocalypse. Plot is not very convincing, main thrills seems
to have been borrowed this time from Mad Max, Aliens, perhaps
Hitchcock.<br /><br />Also, characters are indeed very thin as typically in action movies.
However, Alice developing her physical and especially psychokinetic
powers is very impressive theme (and as becomes evident in the film
probably this will be developed in following parts?). All in the film
goes on like freight train, much of action, much of horror, nothing
much to note, nothing much to complain.<br /><br />Although the film may not be very satisfying itself (as compared to
first part), the main theme (extinction) is. Haven&#39;t seen a movie, so
successfully describing the deserts and hopeless lands after the world
wide catastrophe. Extinction very successfully creates the feeling of
post Nuclear War world. For that, watching it as an picturesque example
of its theme, the film is just perfect. The colors, the deserts, the
road movie theme (stolen, of course from Mad Max II), all seems to fit
just fine. In that the film saves the day and probably boxed it home
too, so hopefully we are too see more sequels (which probably won&#39;t be
as much of quality(?). One more thing, the music is again quite
impressive, a bit of ambient, a bit of metal. There&#39;s an interesting
remake of White Rabbitt but I don&#39;t recognize the band...
