It was entertaining for the most part, very predictable, very clich&eacute;.
The first two resident evil movies had better pace, and believe it or
not was more inventive then this one. Every plot point has been done in
other movies and books. Anyone who has read World War Z will recognize
several of the coincidences, the survivors might has well been carrying
a copy of the zombie survival guide written by max brooks going..OK
what next. In fact, I think there&#39;s once scene taken word for word from
it. (about their need to feed, and survival rate) Also, theirs a scene
that rips of Romero&#39;s Day Of The Dead so badly, I was waiting for a
zombie to say &quot;Hello Aunt Alicia.&quot; and salute people.<br /><br />Anyways, it was mildly entertaining, I wasn&#39;t hoping for much more....I
just didn&#39;t expect such blatant rip offs.
