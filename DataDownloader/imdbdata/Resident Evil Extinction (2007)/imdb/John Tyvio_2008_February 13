Well first, Resident Evil is a good v-game series. Programmers and game
developers made that series to be one of the scariest games ever made.
And all that lean on psychological mood of horror, you&#39;ll never know
what&#39;s behind that door.<br /><br />Resident Evil as a movie is... it is... well damn, i don&#39;t know! It&#39;s
not horror, it&#39;s not pure action or even average action movie and
you&#39;ll know after two minutes that Milla ain&#39;t gonna die. Or if she
dies, she&#39;ll resurrect! Alltought the movie looks good as a picture, it
has no soul. After i saw RE, i felt that i have had sit for less than
two hours doing nothing. Even my gray braincells hadn&#39;t any activity.
