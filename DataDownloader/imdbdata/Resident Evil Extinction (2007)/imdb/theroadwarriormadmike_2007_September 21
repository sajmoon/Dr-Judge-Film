OK is it really called for to use material from 5 different movies??
X-Men 3, Birds, Star Wars, Carrey, and Day of the Dead. For the reviews
for this movie so far, how much is the company that made it paying you
to say it was good? I have never once walked out of a movie, and I was
about to tonight. It was not worth the free ticket I used to see it.
The only good thing about this &quot;movie&quot; was the action scenes.
Personally, I don&#39;t know why a woman with the body of a 12 year old boy
is trying to be sexy either. It doesn&#39;t work. As far as the acting,
I&#39;ve seen better acting in soft core porn movies late at night on the
premium channels. Whether you are a Resident Evil fan, or just a fan of
the zombie movie genre, don&#39;t waste your money. For the love of God, if
people keep going to see these awful movies, they will just keep making
them.
