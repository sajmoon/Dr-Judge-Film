2007_December 11 
I must profess to being somewhat a fan of both the first and second RE
movies (having watched both several times), so was quite looking
forward to the third instalment, especially having read some of the
comments by other posters on the site. Unfortunately the film failed to
live up to its predecessors in every way. The musical score, right from
the start, was poor and largely grated on the nerves, unlike the smooth
hypnotic sections from the first two movies. The film had &#39;b&#39; movie
written all over it, the acting was passable at best, the script poor
and some of the set pieces laughable (alfred Hitchcock anyone). Its a
shame the series has ended (assuming it has) on such a low note.
