I must say i wasn&#x27;t expecting i would rate it a 7. Not after the
mindless Apocalypse. Well, RE Extinction does not offer a brilliant
storyline or great acting. But presents us with some good twists.<br /><br />REE doesn&#x27;t look like a movie per se. Actually, after you watch it, you
get he sensation it is just a halfway to the fourth RE. It makes you
want to watch its sequel right when you finish this one.<br /><br />Lets start with its issues: Too many beautiful people. Thats one of the
reasons i liked Walking Dead. Why does all the characters must be
pretty? what sense does it make? Is it really gonna attract more
viewers? Nop. Pure bullshit. Pretty faces and organized hairs are the
last matter in a post apocalyptic world. Its stupid to put it as a
priority when choosing actors. So what happens is now we have half of
the cast formed by poor actors, at least they&#x27;re pretty and dress
fashionably.<br /><br />Now, the Pros: AMAAAAAAAANZING SOUNDTRACK. I can compare this
soundtrack with Transformers. Amazing and really well made sound
effects pulls you inside the movie. And this is the best part of the
whole thing. I&#x27;m really impressed, because its even better than first
and second RE.<br /><br />Action scenes were better produced, along with zombies make up, what is
probably because of technologies improvement. They have made a highly
entertaining zombie action movie, even if it is not a brilliant film,
has some power to catch our attention.<br /><br />Good to watch eating something caloric if ur looking for a mind
relaxation.
