Resident evil 3 starts out mediocre, and from that standpoint I was
expecting a good an hour and a half. Sure there was more action and
more credible plot than the first two.....but not enough of the action<br /><br />A fairly interesting storyline.....At least interesting enough to keep
my attention. But frankly I was expecting way more violence. Don&#39;t
misconstrue me here. I did not hate this movie. it&#39;s just that I was
expecting more and what I got was average.<br /><br />Although this film is not an impressive action film, it had some
interesting aspects. To start with it was filled with a brilliant cast.
The acting was vital and it has serious actors suitable for their
roles. Also the special effects were amazing. Whoever did the makeup
for the zombies should be proud.<br /><br />The other thing I liked was the linkage of all the scenes to one
another, nowadays movies are made(such as &quot;The Grudge&quot; franchise) in
such a way where you need to rewind and fast forward in order to grasp
the purpose of the scenes. in the contrary in &quot;Resident
Evil:Extinction&quot; the sequences were highly comprehensible from the very
beginning to the end. The scenes weren&#39;t filled with junk dialogues.<br /><br />I have said these positive things about this movie. Yet as overrated as
it was I was expecting a mind blowing action and a remarkable film that
leaves me with nothing to say but &quot;WOW&quot;. For a third movie in the
franchise, extinction is not bad at all. However it doesn&#39;t surpass the
hype.
