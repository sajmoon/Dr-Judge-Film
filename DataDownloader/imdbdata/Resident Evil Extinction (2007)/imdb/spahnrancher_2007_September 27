Of all movies made of video game franchises, Resident Evil is by it&#39;s
own right a fairly entertaining series of films. The games have always
been a standout amongst others, so why shouldn&#39;t the film adaptations.<br /><br />Extinction is by far the best of the three. Mulcahy was the right
choice of director for this one. His atmospheric eye and fearless sense
of close-ups take you for a 1 1/2 hour ride (that doesn&#39;t feel like you
wasted your 8 bucks).<br /><br />The attention to detail and finally plot that that resolutes, not to
mention the film&#39;s tight editing make this an entertaining ride.<br /><br />You finally care about why this event has happened, and most
importantly you have characters who seem to care as well.<br /><br />Not a perfect film, but reasonably close. Will there be a fourth
installment? I am pretty sure we all know the answer to that.<br /><br />Who will take the responsibility from here? That we must wait to see...
