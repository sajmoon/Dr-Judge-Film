I always LOVED the title Resident Evil .. , was a huge fan of the game
itself, and when the 1st resident Evil was out .. IT Was Amazing ! I
loved it Watched it .. Like 3 to 4 times .. And in my other reviews ..
I always put it on top of the best movies in that genre .. but this
seriously and dramatically changed .. resident evil 2 .. was still nice
with very good acting and nice characters .. suspense ending .. nice
effects .. and it kept me on edge &#133; zombies taking over the city .. a
some balanced gore .. and tense action .. but wasn&#39;t still as good as
part 1 .., but now with resident Evil Extension &#133;I feel like the movie
series got out of control .. out of focus and specially not as exciting
as before .. , it is going to the direction of heroes or the 4400 in
some way ..not a zombie movie anymore !!! I go to see resident evil I
except a thriller horror movie With a lot of zombie action &#133; in the
traditional way ! , if zombies can think .. well they are not zombies
any more .. no ? the movie is not well done .. I guess it got almost
1/2 the budget of resident evil 2 or maybe even less ! , you are not
attached to any of the movie characters &#133; you basically don&#39;t care who
dies and who lives , so where is the gold old zombie suspense .. ? the
action parts was not as exciting as we used from resident evil &#133; I
basically don&#39;t think that will make a resident evil 4 ..not worth it
anymore !
