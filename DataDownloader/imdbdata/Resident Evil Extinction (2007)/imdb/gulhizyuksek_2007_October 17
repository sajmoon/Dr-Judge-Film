I went to see this because I was a big fan of the original 2 games that
came out in the 90&#39;s and saw all three movies of the franchise for this
reason. This was the most disappointing of the lot, because of it&#39;s
further departure from the game and the lame pace, pointless plot,
undeveloped characters that made it unbearable. I was bored by the pace
and only stayed for the end to see if they were saving all their money
for some grand finale or battle or monster but the film was just
getting worse every minute and I am dead serious about that. The
characters were not developed which added to the boredom and the battle
scenes didn&#39;t impress me, same old fast paced-cut-to-slow motion-head
lobbing action with boring gore. This tedious film also has so many rip
offs it&#39;s unsettling for a film fan; like ripping off great movies such
as the Mad Max Series and Hitchcock&#39;s Birds to name a few. So I thought
it was a big disappointment and can&#39;t understand anyone who enjoyed it,
they must be on drugs, getting paid or laid by someone or possibly just
the producer&#39;s aunt and uncle writing positive reviews because this
film is not scary or entertaining, it&#39;s Horrible!
