2008_April 28 
Well i waited a long time for this one to come out,, it was pretty
good,, but not as good as the first,, but then again when are movies as
good as the first,, i think the first half of this movie kicks ass and
takes names,, and Milla Jovovich is as sexy as ever,, even Mike Epps is
fun,, and the dogs are back for a little bit too,, in the second half
of the movie,, the story loses some of the original punch,, it slows
down a little too much for me,, but it does manage to pick it up a
notch again,, for a decent ending i thought,, i just think this movie
like most,, in this genre that are a sequel,, is it was disjointed ,,
meaning the pieces just don&#39;t seem to fit,, i mean all the action was
there,, and Milla was great as usual,, and the Umbrella Corporation is
mentioned quite frequently,, and the return of Alice not to mention,,
so it&#39;s a good movie,, but can&#39;t top the original.
