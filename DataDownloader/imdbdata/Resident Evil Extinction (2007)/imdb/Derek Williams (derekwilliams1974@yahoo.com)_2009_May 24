I just finished watching this movie on DVD. I am a fan of the Resident
Evil franchise and had been delighted with it&#x27;s quirky take on the
horror niche zombie genre. I won&#x27;t bore the reader with a recap of the
plot line. If your reading the comments here, you have an idea of what
the franchise is about and where this film is probably going. So, I&#x27;ll
just cut to the chase. Resident Evil: Extinction is a disappointing
third film in the Resident Evil franchise. I won&#x27;t say trilogy, because
there is an opening for another installment. So I would say watch this
film so that you are up to speed in the inevitable fourth film. Just
don&#x27;t expect the fun of the first Resident Evil.<br /><br />I have to say watching the increasing regression in quality of this
franchise has been a disappointment.<br /><br />I remember seeing Mila Jovovich and Paul W.S. Anderson at a Fangoria
convention plugging the first Resident Evil to a very bored and jaded
audience who had long ago gotten tired of every filmmaker insisting
their project was a totally new type of horror film. When I finally got
to see the movie in the theater I was pleasantly surprised to see that
Resident Evil was indeed a breath of fresh air in the horror genre.<br /><br />What I think went wrong with the franchise is that once the studio
executives discovered they had lightening in a bottle with the first
Resident Evil, everyone now put their grubby fingers in the creative
process and mucked the whole works up. Resident Evil: Extinction
probably is the victim of too many film executives trying to put their
stamp on this film and here is the result.
