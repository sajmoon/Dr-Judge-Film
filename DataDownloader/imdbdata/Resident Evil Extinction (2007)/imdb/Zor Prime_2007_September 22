In the not too distant future, viral weaponry research and development
goes all wrong. What follows is an entertaining vision for any fan of
zombie pandemic stories or just plain world/human survival style films.
The first film in this franchise is decidedly the best with
as-believable-as-can-be ideas, nifty effects, a decent (not
over-the-top) story. The second and third films, however, move pretty
far away from the basic zombie survival story and much further into
character-based stories with a focus on splinter/spin-off concepts like
wildly comic book/cartoonish science fiction elements. So if you enjoy
movies that are based on comic books or video games that will require
you to accept a lot of really over-the-top ideas (like superpowers,
supernatural powers, CHUD-style mutation, magic, etc.), then you will
still enjoy the latter two films since they are not bad on that merit.
They&#39;re also okay as general apocalyptic survival stories. However, as
a fan of the zombie genre, if you were expecting a solid continuation
of the basic story of zombie infection from the first film, these
sequels will let you down. The Romero-style zombies in these films are
really just extras that apparently just needed to be in the background
making room for more intense and faster (though much less believable)
antagonists. Maybe this is because films like 28 Days/Weeks and Zack
Snyder&#39;s Dawn of the Dead have done much to turn the volume down on
lumbering old-style zombies and Paul W.S. Anderson felt that he needed
to crank up the action factor.<br /><br />In RE3, our heroes finally figure out that moving to near the arctic
circle would be a good move (you know, COLD + ZOMBIE = IMMOBILE
ZOMBIE), and decide to hoof it to Alaska after learning of a possible
isolated colony of survivors there. There are a number of new twists on
the infection (you will be thinking of Bud The Zombie and/or Bud The
CHUD at a few points), and there will be more Boyle/Snyder style zombie
goodness to contend with mixed in with the normal zombie hoards.<br /><br />There were, however, some hold-out thematic elements from the first two
films. There are zombie Doberman pinchers, creepy hologram girls with
British accents, plenty of zombie-around-the-corner jump-in-your-seat
moments, and of course Alice either naked or in hot Road Warrior-style
tactical gear. There is the terrible T-Virus infection, and the perfect
anti-virus strait out of the X-Files. There are new hints at the
answers to old questions, and some new things to think about that still
relate to the basic T-Virus. And without a doubt, there&#39;s the recurring
theme of the evil big corporation (The Umbrella Corp. A.K.A.
Halliburton + Merck + United Healthcare) which caused the mess but has
managed to out-survive governments and massive population decimation.
The moral here? What happens when a capitalistic society allows a
private entity to become too powerful? The evil private scientists
always plot to rule the world at the expense of the common population.<br /><br />Anyway, I don&#39;t go to the theater to see films often, but I try to make
it to the big-budget zombie flicks... However, on the merit of being a
zombie film, I could have waited for this one to roll to DVD...
