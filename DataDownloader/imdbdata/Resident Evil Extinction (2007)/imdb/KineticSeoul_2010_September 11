This starts off almost exactly like RE 1 and makes the audience that
has seen the first installment think they are having a deja vu which
adds a nice touch to the movie since it starts out with a bang.
Although repetitious and dull at times, the director did a decent job
with this installment well at least slightly better than the first
installment and most definitely way better than the second one. Now it
clearly shows that they don&#x27;t give a crap if it relates with the RE
video games or not and just want to cash in though, well at least it
was somewhat entertaining.The plot this time is mainly about survival
as well, a group a survivors including Alice is trying to survive the
zombie mayhem while the head researcher in Umbrella Corporation is
trying to find the real Alice for his projects. What I didn&#x27;t like is
how it added psychic powers in the game, which it showed in the second
movie in the series. It just did not fit in with this type of movie,
even if it&#x27;s mostly sci fi, I didn&#x27;t like it, this isn&#x27;t freaking
X-Men. I also didn&#x27;t like the character L.J., he was annoying in the
first movie and is more annoying this time around. Basically a
pointless character and a pointless character in the second one as
well. When it comes to animal zombies, first it was dogs and now they
also have crows in this one which is one of the coolest scenes in the
movie when a mass amount of zombie crows start attacking the survivors.
Watching the zombie crows was much more entertaining than zombie dogs,
I mean kung fu and dogs just looks plain stupid. And sometimes it seems
like a war movie with zombies, so yeah although the story is really
weak it does have some cool scenes and wasn&#x27;t annoying to watch. All in
all, this is a pretty good popcorn flick.<br /><br />7.2/10
