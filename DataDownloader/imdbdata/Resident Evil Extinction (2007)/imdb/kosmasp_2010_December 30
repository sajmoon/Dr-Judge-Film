As with the second one continuing where the first one left off, this
does continue where the second left us. And again it does make sense,
to have seen the movies that came before this one. One welcome addition
(survivor from part 2) in this one, is Oded F. He really grounds things
and his role seems to get expanded (though you never know in a movie
like this, now do you?).<br /><br />He was also commenting on part 2, though I haven&#x27;t listen to any audio
commentary for this part (they are entertaining, even if you didn&#x27;t
quite like the movies ... if you liked them you will relish them
anyway). But the setting is good and the tone seems to really fit the
movie. There are quite a few good scenes and it is a continuation that
fits with the rest of the movies.
