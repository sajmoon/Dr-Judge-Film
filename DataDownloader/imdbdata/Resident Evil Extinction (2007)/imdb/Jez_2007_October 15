Resident Evil: Extinction follows on from the previous 2 RE films,
although set some years after the events of RE. Apocalypse. The setting
is a post-apocalyptic earth inhabited predominately by zombie
mutations, with a few human survivors fighting their way through life.<br /><br />The difference with this film from the 2 before it is that it suffers
from little plot, being more than slightly rushed towards the end to
fit what plot there is into it and stretches far too much of what isn&#39;t
needed. Each of the films have there own flaws but this one is weighed
down by a hefty chunk of exposition and &#39;story&#39; which is mainly not
required i.e. most of the first 45 minutes of the film, which sets the
tone to slow and laborious rather than atmospheric or action packed.<br /><br />What action there is though, is good. The monsters are OK (certainly
better looking than &#39;Nemesis&#39; from the last film, who was essentially
just a giant cartoon) and the acting is... there. What suffers though,
is the plot. More so, the lack of it. Without revealing anything, some
parts rely too heavily on the first film for ideas and most of it seems
to be giving George A. Romero&#39;s &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; more than just a nod
and wink.<br /><br />All this said, it isn&#39;t a bad film. It has a violent charm and some
good effects and action and a couple of, albeit predicable, jumpy
moments. However, so much could have been done that wasn&#39;t, so I see
this as a somewhat missed opportunity for what will probably be the
last in this series of films.
