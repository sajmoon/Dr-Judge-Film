Oh my goodness i haven&#39;t reviewed a movie in so long on here but after
seeing Resident Evil: Extinction and knowing fanboys are gonna give it
a bad score i was compelled to completely gush about how completely
awesome this third installment was. To recap my opinion i thought the
first film was really cool some little thrills, some neat special
effects, but Alice was just so cool, i fall in love with bad@$$
heroines like that character with the exception of Halle Berry&#39;s
Catwoman for obvious reasons lol. The second film only furthered my
adrenaline rush with Milla doing all kinds of crazy stunts and that
film felt closer to the games also made nemesis look amazing thank god
they didn&#39;t use CGI. The third movie takes place in the Nevada desert..
well for the most part anyways Alice and a core few of the survivors
unfortunately not including Jill *cries* are scrounging the world
trying to survive and find food, gas, supplies etc without being eaten
by the massive army of zombies that surrounds pretty much the whole
world. Milla is amazing once again but this time she takes the reigns
from Sigorney Weaver because this time Alice is no sex symbol she&#39;s an
angry woman on a nonstop rampage not afraid to kill and think twice.
The action in this movie is so amazing the change of directors really
helped get away from the choppy hand to hand fights in Apocalypse plus
this is the director of Highlander here mister Russel Mulchy is no
stranger to great action films. There&#39;s a lot more scares in this one
and a lot more gore and grizzly murder creating entertaining mayhem on
the big screen. I love truly epic films like Alfred Hitchcocks work,
The Departed, and Requiem For A Dream but i go to the theater to be
massively entertained by more than just my bucket of popcorn and
Resident Evil: Extinction keeps your eyes on the screen.
