Whereas it is easy to sympathise with Alien, Terminator, Matrix (etc.)
fan boys for feeling shortchanged and insulted as they watched their
beloved franchises complete the circle from B-movies masquerading as
A-movies to ending up as D-movies, I&#x27;ll never understand the Resident
Evil crowd&#x27;s objection to these flicks. The original video games were
not brain food with lines like &#x22;Jill sandwich&#x22; and &#x22;you, the &#x27;Master of
Unlocking&#x27;&#x22; delivered by the most stilted voice actors heard since the
Zelda CD-I games. Also, considering Romero and Co. have botched the
simple concept of the zombie genre, it&#x27;s fun to just escape into the
post-apocalyptic fantasy land where slow moving flesh-eaters &#x27;live&#x27;
again.<br /><br />It helps that I never enjoyed the entirety of Mad Max, Alien
Resurrection, The Matrix, Land of The Dead and any number of other
movies this steals from. And that they only chose to steal the good
stuff and trim away all the talky bits. So instead of all that cod
philosophy horsesh*t and exposition meetings with the Yoda Oracle that
bore you to tears, you get Milla Jovovovovavich able to bend time and
space until Umbrella turn off her power switch. Simple.<br /><br />The film starts off with a clone Milla biting the dust: &#x27;Evil
corporation constantly cloning until they find the perfect specimen&#x27;
cribbed from Alien 4. Steal from the best, I guess. This was cool. A
concept so illogical that it pulls you into the fantasy. Cut to a Mad
Max rip off of a truck or bus or whateverdafu*k pimped out in
faux-Megaweapon armor dicing the head of a zombie as the kids aboard
Dead Reckoning cheer. This was also cool... just because. Some other
stuff happens like that annoying comic-relief character from the second
movie getting bitten and Milla acting a more likable lead for once.
Both very cool. Come to think of it, this movie is perfect at quickly
dispensing with secondary characters you had just assumed would become
permanent fixtures. &#x22;Mar, I don&#x27;t like her... oh cool she&#x27;s enveloped
by crows!&#x22; it took him two movies to get there, but Paul Anderson now
knows that people don&#x27;t want to be annoyed by those on screen.<br /><br />Although this movie lacks fundamentals like a fortified mall or a
Tenpenny Tower safe zone, a Milla ginger muff shot, and a scene of a
drunk sniper in a cowboy hat taking gleeful potshots of ambling zombies
fueling every ten-year-old boy&#x27;s dream lifestyle (they used up all
three by the second pic), it does have Super Milla64. An indestructible
super badass who&#x27;s super motorcycle boots drove me to cross dressing
with super envy. All the wire work in the climatic super duper zombie
showdown in a very sandy Las Vegas elicited the same &#x22;woah!&#x22; from me as
when I first saw Ted Theodore Logan bouncing off the pillars wasting
regenerating video game enemies with unlimited ammo. And that&#x27;s kinda
the point.
