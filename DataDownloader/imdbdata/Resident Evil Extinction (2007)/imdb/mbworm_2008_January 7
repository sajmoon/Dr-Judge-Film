If you&#39;re a fan of the games, then you would have probably mildly
enjoyed the first two films in the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; franchise. Part one
found a group of soldiers exploring an underground labyritnth of lab
rooms and crawling with the undead, with only a few people making it
back to the surface alive. The &quot;T-Virus&quot;, created by scientists working
for the Umbrella Corporation was unleashed into the lab, which started
the whole horror. <br /><br />&quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot; found the &quot;T-Virus&quot; making its way to the
surface, killing off the residents of Raccoon city, beneath which the
Umbrella Corporation had built the secret lab that contained the virus.
When it broke out, the Umbrella Corporation blockaded the city,
attempting to keep infection within its walls.<br /><br />Where you thought it was over, it turns out the horror had only begun.
The T-Virus, which is spread from one person to another through blood
contact, has plagued the world and all of the continents have dried up,
turning into barren wastelands in &quot;Resident Evil: Extinction&quot;. Milla
Jovovich returns with another strong performance as Alice, who was the
main character in the first two films, having survived and then
kidnapped and tampered with by Umbrella now. Now she&#39;s loose, fighting
the undead and trying to stay alive in the Nevada desert. When Alice
comes across a convoy making a desperate stand to stay alive, together
they join ranks to bring Umbrella down and to find a cure for the
virus.<br /><br />Highly unbelievable, Resident Evil manages to be an exciting horror
fantasy, and this third installment is the best. The cinematography,
writing, and acting are all top notch here. Director Russel Mulcahy
makes this entry run smooth, with plenty of gore and scares to keep die
hard horror fans interested. Milla Jovovich is still the best, the
tough girl who can do anything. It&#39;s campy and fun the whole way, but
with a rather disappointing climax. The action is absolutely the best
here.
