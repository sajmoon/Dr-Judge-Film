I think Resident Evil: Extinction elevates itself slightly higher than
its two predecessors and slightly higher than I thought it would in
general. On one hand, it is a series of bizarre and somewhat illogical
events that transpire under the scenario of an apocalyptic event&#39;s
aftermath but on the other, it is a pastiche of &#39;zombie&#39; films gone by;
a crude study of one man&#39;s obsession with his research and a somewhat
guilty action film. I liked Resident Evil: Extinction a little more
than others of its type because it gives us more of a sedate look at
the situation rather than a mere exploitation of special effects,
attractive heroines and needless gore. Yes, it&#39;s true to say that this
film has action scenes of a silly nature but they do not seem as stupid
as previous Resident Evil films in which the protagonist is able to use
kung-fu on dogs and make impossible shots to defeat her foes.<br /><br />The action scenes here are paced better and do not rely on the mere
visualisation of actually seeing a Licker monster or Nemeses himself as
the reason to keep watching. The enemies here are unspectacular and
familiar and all the better for it; we get the feeling this is more of
a survival film about the beasts and beings that would actually be out
there rather than dumb scenes that try to impress us with a mentality:
&quot;Look, a Licker.&quot; or &quot;Look, this is what Nemeses would look like in
reality.&quot;. In the film, there is a scene in which several zombies come
charging out of a metal crate. The scene works on the level of realism
within the film because the film could so easily have substituted them
for a larger, more visually impressive enemy that would&#39;ve sufficed for
the following action scene.<br /><br />I mentioned the word &#39;realism&#39; in that paragraph, perhaps crazily so.
But Resident Evil: Extinction takes time to present its heroes, all of
whom travel in a procession of large vehicles, with every day issues
that would affect them. Things like &#39;how much fuel is left? Where is
the nearest petrol station?&#39;; &#39;Where is the next meal coming from?&#39; and
&#39;How can we bed down for the night safely and free from attack?&#39; These
sorts of questions were lost in the previous films and are empty from
other recent post-apocalyptic horror/sci-fi films like Blade: Trinity.
Additionally, when the film does reveal its particularly large scale
monster for the film&#39;s climax it does so in an effective manner. This
is because we have had the monster and the source for the monster
presented to us on another plot line. We get a feeling that it may
happen within the world of the film unlike when Nemeses popped up in
the last film merely because he&#39;s had the injection and must now just
keep destroying stuff until he meets the hero for the finale fight.<br /><br />Although it takes on the matter of the pacing and the clarity of the
action scenes, Resident Evil: Extinction is still guilty of one or two
things. The film actually begins in a manner than had me dreading it
would be as bad as the previous two. Alice (Jovovich) meets some human
survivors but discovers them oddly unfriendly which acts more of a
surprise than a dramatic twist. It&#39;s a scene in which implied prior
victims have been conned, raped and then fed to the dogs; in this case
infected dogs and sure enough Alice finds herself in the said situation
&#150; a sequence of events that plays out in a daft manner that reminds you
of the prior films. It had me thinking &#39;how do the renegade survivors
lock the infected dogs up for next time once they&#39;ve had their fun?&#39;
Then there was the rather careless scene in which Alice falls asleep in
the middle of the desert, at night and with the fire still burning &#150;
not smart considering the situation. The film is also disappointing in
the sense that when the procession of vehicles housing the characters
Alice, they are spread evenly in ethnicity and attitude meaning each
individual &#39;type&#39; could be killed off accordingly.<br /><br />But for the best part, Resident Evil: Extinction is a surprisingly
enjoyable film with an interesting set-up and I was really quite fond
of the story running parallel involving Dr. Isaacs (Glen) and his
research in developing the un-dead, albeit a clear reference to Dr.
Logan in Day of the Dead. This plot line runs alongside the development
of the convoy and the situations they must deal with, the thing I like
here is that these people are not world savers; they will not go on a
cause and effect fuelled story and make all the un-dead disappear, they
are just there to survive and through Alice their goal is to make it to
the icy regions of Alaska.<br /><br />The bizarre thing about this latest Resident Evil instalment is just
how good it might&#39;ve been had it cut the action scenes down a little
and tidied up the opening twenty or so minutes. It is disappointing
that the convoy is made up of a Redneck (who&#39;s naturally good at
sniping); an Aussie; two African-Americans; a Mexican and a
wise-talking white American, all of whom exist for zombie fodder at the
end of the day but this film instils me with hope that perhaps the
films can be as good as the games &#150; in the games, ammunition was a very
sacred thing and the tactic of running from enemies rather than
shooting them was a good one. In the films, the producers are gradually
realising this and the next film may well surprise a few people in
terms of how watchable it actually is.
