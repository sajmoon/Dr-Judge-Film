if &quot;lord of the flies&quot; sucked, it would be this movie... i quite liked
the premise of &quot;battle royale&quot;, sort of an update and extension of the
ideas in william golding's novel, melded with orwell's &quot;1984&quot;, or
stephen king's &quot;the long walk/the running man&quot;... it falls short of
those tales in many ways...<br /><br />i longed for more explanation of where the battle royale law came
from... i expected the shots of the school that housed the children to
be absolutely horrific... to me, it seemed it would take a shocking
drop in quality of life for a society to revert to &quot;battle royale&quot;...
some background or principle guiding force needed to be explored... the
movie seemed to happen in a vacuum, too eager to set up the hyper
violence its audience craves... and what did anyone expect the game to
achieve?...<br /><br />the children's responses to the game were at times interesting, but
needed more exploration... some were simply laughable... the
psychopathic character was obviously just supposed to look like a ultra
cool &quot;crow&quot; type being... i wanted history, case files, background...
when pushed too hard, the concepts of the back stories fell over like a
cardboard set... what of expansion on the fascinating &quot;teacher&quot;
character?...<br /><br />although the bloody special effects were not convincing, i found the
death parade somewhat obscene after awhile... the obsession with girls
and boys in school uniforms decorated in blood and assuming twisted
poses rings vaguely suspect... is it art?... or a cynical pandering to
some unhealthy obsessions?... i suppose i'll have to give the director
the benefit of the doubt...<br /><br />this movie seems to be aimed at an immature audience, longing for
non-stop violence and childish declarations of teenage emotion... it
would be inconceivable to show this to the age group that the film
actually deals with...<br /><br />one needs to view this movie (armed as it is with some arresting shots
and provocative ideas) with the question: what is it trying to say once
the plot of the story has been established?... is it a profound
statement on violence; or on how a society treats its children, or
perhaps even how children interact... or is it a low budget
shock-horror masquerading as social commentary?...<br /><br />the violence is the stuff of cartoons and graphic novels, the pace is
that of a video game... perhaps you could say that the intent is
metaphorical, and i wrestled with the purpose and meaning of this movie
with every frame my eye could digest...<br /><br />however, i took away nothing i could agree with, or disagree with, or
even question... there was nothing to discuss... there was no outrage
(save on a paedophilic platform)... my mind was clean, untroubled by an
endless trainride of child slaughter...<br /><br />when ralph breaks down into tears at the end of the &quot;lord of the
flies&quot;, (a very relevant touch point for this movie) i was ready to
join him... if i did not see the rich vein of ideas, i could at least
see the terrible, final sadness the protagonist carried... if my mind
did not engage, my heart did... battle royale has not tried to be
wellspring, it is merely a mirror to a poor, shallow reflection...
