&#x22;What idiots. We might have all survived.&#x22;<br /><br />How to even begin to describe this? It&#x27;s like Lord of the Flies meets
Hard-Boiled meets any of the countless anime about high school kids
battling each other. Very violent, very un-PC, very entertaining, and
very Japanese.<br /><br />The story is simple. A group of disrespectful Japanese ninth graders
are chosen by the government to be drugged while on a trip and sent off
to an island for a kill or be killed battle royale. The only way to
survive is to be the only living student by the third day. Some of the
kids try to resist and band together to find a way out of this deadly
game, while others immediately take to all the killing and mayhem.
Either way, the results are usually the same: a lot of violence and
dead bodies. And some genuinely sad moments, as well.<br /><br />Battle Royale is easily one of the best action flicks I&#x27;ve seen this
year. All the shooting, explosions, and double-crosses, mixed with
frequent talk about crushes and other normal teenager stuff, is just
surreally awesome. I&#x27;m seen this kind of stuff in anime tons of times,
but to see it in live-action takes it to an entirely new level. The
pacing is excellent, there&#x27;s nary a dull moment to be seen, and the
carnage is frequent.&#xA0;<br /><br />This was one of the rare movies that I didn&#x27;t want to see end. It&#x27;s
obviously not for everyone, but if my brief description sounded cool,
don&#x27;t waste any time on getting your hands on this.
