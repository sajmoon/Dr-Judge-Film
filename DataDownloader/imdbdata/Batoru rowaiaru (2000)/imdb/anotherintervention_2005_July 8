I had heard some excellent reviews about Battle Royale, and so I
watched it expecting an excellent portrayal of children fending for
themselves trying to survive in an almost Lord of the Flies fashion. I
could not have been more wrong. Poor acting, cheesy storyline as well
as quite a few unbelievable scenarios made sitting through the entire
movie a bit difficult. Now I will admit - the Japanese have made quite
a few disturbing movies, and so about halfway through I continued to
watch with the hope that something would give me a shock and perhaps
give reason for the 7.9/10 rating that it currently has. Sadly, my
hopes were in vain. Perhaps I am a bit desensitized thanks to all of
the disturbing films that I have seen in my life, but in my opinion,
shootings and stabbings do not constitute an extremely shocking movie.
Granted - the killing were all done by children, but the movie was just
not written in a way that focused on the loss of innocence. I give this
flick a thumbs down.
