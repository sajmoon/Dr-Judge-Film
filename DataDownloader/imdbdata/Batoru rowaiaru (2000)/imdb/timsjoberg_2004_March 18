This movie is a 15 year-old's dream.
For those of us who are fully clear of puberty, its a strange
film.
The violence is graphic, but ridiculous. The characters are paper thin.
The
only good thing is at least I can keep the cliched characters straight. I
was amused by the nerd, and cheered for the wicked trashy girl. And it was
fun seeing Go-Go from Kill Bill, even if she died pretty early
on.
I really hated the two random students who were added - Mr. evil crazy
hair
and Mr. goody goody. Basically they did all the killing, they looked about
25 years old.
The stat lines at the bottom are absolutely hilarious.
The Teacher was just ridiculous. Not to mention that the government was
paying 20some soldiers for 3 days just to kill a few middle
schoolers.
I don't feel like I wasted my time seeing this. But I wouldn't recommend
it
to a friend. Japanese movies are weird...
