... well not really but you get what i mean. This film is an absolute
wrecking ball to peoples perspective on Japanese cinema. It was thought
of as unintelligent and repetitive cinema, then this came along. Along
with crouching tiger, hidden dragon Asian cinema was never the same
again.<br /><br />The concept is such a simple one. A bunch of teenagers are placed on an
island and are forced to kill each other. At first barbaric the film
hasn't much hope but the script and acting is superb. Some of the
students are terrified of killing their fellow students where as others
take it like a duck to water. Memorable characters also make this film
even more memorable.<br /><br />You basically follow the two main characters with the focus switching
to other parts of the island. You see the evil Kazou and Mitsuko
slaughter mindlessly leading to some great scenes. Who could forget
kazou holding the megaphone in front of the dying girls mouth as she
whimpers her last words. Sick, but genius. That is why i love this
film. It's not a masterpiece as the ending is a disappointment but the
rest is great.<br /><br />The acting is surprisingly good and the violence is terrible. Overall
an amazing film.
