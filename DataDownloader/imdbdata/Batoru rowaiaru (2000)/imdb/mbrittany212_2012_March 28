Let&#x27;s face it, we all know that movies are never as good as books.
However I was incredibly disappointed at how the movie compared to the
book. The book was so in depth, and intense. I know that it&#x27;s hard to
fit a 600 page book into 2 hours without losing some of the depth, but
I just felt like this movie was about nothing more than all of the kids
killing each other. The book had me loving these characters, hating the
characters, on the edge of my seat, and actually in tears near the end
of the book. The movie just felt empty. It all went by so fast. If you
haven&#x27;t read the book, and you want a scary movie, by all means watch
this. However if you&#x27;ve read the book, it&#x27;s not worth 2 hours of your
time. I&#x27;m just going to pretend like I never watched it and just hold
onto what the book gave me.
