This is my favourite film of all time. And why? Not because of the gore
(I'm not that evil), but because it's a horror film with a BRILLIANT
plot! You wouldn't see any American horror films think of something as
ingenious as this, would you? Thise Japs are an evil bunch, aren't
they? And that's a good thing, in this case. I've seen so many horror
films that have failed to impress me, and before watching this I
thought 'God, another one of these mindless eye-gouging films'. But was
I proved wrong! And that (again) is a good thing. I even think the
acting was good, and I'm very tight about acting. The twisted, evilness
of it combined with the main character's lives and loves really makes
this an absolutely must-see film. Oh, and the gore was pretty cool too!
:) Honestly, if you want a good film to watch, Battle Royale is the
film to watch!
