It has some unbelievable story behind itself (one can even call it
laughable) but it is that rare example when the background story does
not matter. By &quot;the background story&quot; I mean the &quot;apocalyptic&quot;
situation in Japan as it is explained in the beginning of the movie.
Style is a dressing of this meal. The movie can be compared to
Shakespeare's tragedy &quot;Hamlet&quot;. I grabbed the DVD as soon as I could
(overpaid of course, got a not brand-new DVD, but never regretted). I
respect this movie more than any other. If our kids reached the peak of
excellence in &quot;Kanikuly Petrova i Vasechkina, obyknovennye i
neveroyatnye&quot;, then the Japanese ones hit the ceiling in this one. Ours
succeeded in comedy, while theirs - in bloodshed.<br /><br />The choice of music and the way it's applied to the movie are perfect.
I'd like to compare it to &quot;Clockwork ...&quot;. In that one the combination
of fine music and ugly westerly images provoked deep disgust. I
disrespect &quot;Clockwork ...&quot; for that. But in &quot;Batoru ...&quot; even the most
violent scenes are orientally beautiful.<br /><br />I did not watch &quot;BR 2&quot; and I will not. I bought and watched &quot;The Matrix
Reloaded&quot; once and I wish I had not. Come on, people, &quot;Batoru rowaiaru&quot;
is to be on the top 50 list. Let's just throw some cheap titles away
and push this one in.<br /><br />Words. Words. Words... The words are not enough - deep respect to Mr
Kinji Fukasaku. 10 out of 10. Thank you for attention.
