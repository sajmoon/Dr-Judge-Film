I have to say that alternative reality films are definitely my favorite
film genre. Blindness (2008) and Children of Men (2006) are without any
doubt two genre masterpieces, including also elements of science
fiction.<br /><br />The whole idea surrounding the film was arousing: The government has
failed to control increasing violence and indiscipline in schools,
combined with a growing economic crisis, pretty much like nowadays.
Even the idea of making and island (just like &#x22;Blindness&#x22;) to perform
this extreme measure of control of adolescents is immoral but told as a
story is respectable. <br /><br />The film starts really good, but the whole thing sadly changed when the
first school boy killed one of his classmates.<br /><br />People tend to show this film as a deformation of Japanese culture, or
even a critic of Japanese double moral. Well, I&#x27;m pretty sure that this
has nothing to do with Japanese youth, I know for certain this because
I traveled several times there.<br /><br />I have to reject this absurd line of argument showing teens as
potential assassins whose biggest problems are crushes and gossips
between them, becoming even more unreal when you are facing such a
disturbing situation like encountering the death of your fellow
classmates.<br /><br />In every alternative reality film there is a thin line: the plot has to
be always plausible. If you cross this line, like happened here the
moment the boy killed the other, an alternate reality becomes a comedy,
like Monty Python.<br /><br />But the problem here is that there is no satire or comedy, it&#x27;s just a
bunch of teens killing each other without any logical reason. <br /><br />I&#x27;m pretty annoyed because the idea or the background was great. The
only problem was the thing of killing each other. You can explore other
possibilities like a group trying to build a boat or a refugee camp
(like &#x22;Lost&#x22;), even if they risk their life&#x27;s with the collar bomb
(like &#x22;Saw&#x22;, a group of teens killing the military and disguising as
them; the serial killer / predator idea: you know who has died but you
never know the one that is killing each other (&#x22;Identity&#x22;); a group
confident suicide while they discuss a form of protest against this
law, fighting the inevitable death (&#x22;Cube&#x22;). Blindness again is a
really good example of how this film should have been. The
possibilities are endless.<br /><br />The extremist idea of killing each other is absolutely surreal. A lot
of films explore this idea: when other humans kill other humans the
person has to disrupt his own human nature. Specially when these humans
are teenagers.<br /><br />In concussion, the trivialization of death, youth and coming of age
that this film does is disgusting. <br /><br />4 out of 10
