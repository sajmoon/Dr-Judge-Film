excerpt, more at my location - Based on Koushun Takami&#x27;s 1999 manga,
Battle Royale stunned and outraged the Japanese parliament upon its
release in 2000. <br /><br />Ten years on, does it retain its impact?<br /><br />The intensity of the opening, as the &#x27;chosen&#x27; children learn their
predicament, and the bitter righteousness with which teacher Kitano
establishes his dominance over them is instantly gripping, and visually
horrifying.<br /><br />Battle Royale deserves every bit of its enduring cult success. <br /><br />Ten years on, it remains as shocking, powerful and twistedly
exhilarating as it was upon release. Sensational.
