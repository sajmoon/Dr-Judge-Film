Japanese genre movies have the quality that they leave nobody
indifferent. Whether it&#x27;s positive or negative, they all leave a
certain impression. &#x22;Battle Royale&#x22; is no different, it&#x27;s a
controversial movie but even the people who hate it can&#x27;t deny that it
has a beautiful, unbridled directness. This movie doesn&#x27;t screw around,
it&#x27;s very raw and violent. It doesn&#x27;t lose itself in redundant
sub-plots or misguided attempts at being anything it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s just a
very straight-forward actioner with social comments brought in at
exactly the right times. The protagonists are pretty bland, but that&#x27;s
not really an issue when the villains are so delightfully evil.
Kiriyama gunning down unarmed girls just for the heck of it, not a lot
of scenes that can compete with that. Mitsuko could be even better
though, or maybe her scythe is just a way cooler weapon. Overall this
movie fully deserves it&#x27;s cult status. It also comes with a sequel,
which I&#x27;m sad to say kinda blows.
