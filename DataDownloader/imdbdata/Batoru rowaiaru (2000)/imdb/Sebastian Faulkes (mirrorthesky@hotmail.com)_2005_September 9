It may seem I am being over generous with this vote, yet something
within this appeals to me on an almost sub-conscious level. As
previously outlined, this is a very brave work on the part of the
Fukasaku's. Not only does it physically depict children hunting and
killing each other in a sadistic government sponsored game show, it
makes a direct attack on Japanese culture as a whole, I believe. This
can be seen by the use of Hara Hara Tokei, and actual anti-Japan
movement magazine.<br /><br />Fans of the manga should also be pretty happy with this film
adaptation, as Fukasaku has tried to keep as close to the original
story as is possible on celluloid. Perhaps not as close as Miike's Ichi
the Killer adaptation is, however. This aside, it is an immensely
enjoyable film with plenty of storyline, political connotations and
action to appease all manner of movie fans.<br /><br />Fukasaku's films are influenced by his childhood spent clearing bodies
from the streets of Japan during the war. This perhaps justifies his
use of graphic violence against children within the film, as what is
depicted here can seem nothing but cartoonish in comparison to the
horrors he faced as a youth. It could even be seen as a warning of
getting children involved in adult affairs, as one of the most
predominant themes running through the movie is youth challenging
authority; the very reason the BR Act was commissioned. As Fukusaku
lost his childhood to war, he warns that if children are given adult
tasks too young, the Japan of tomorrow could be as seen within the
film.
