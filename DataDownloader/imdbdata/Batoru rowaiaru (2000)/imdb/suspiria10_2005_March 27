In the not too distant future the whole of Japan is on the verge of
collapse. With their society in tatters and the economy hitting the
skids as a last ditch effort they enact the &quot;BR Act&quot;. The BR act is a
tool by which the government reels in the unruly youth that are the
downfall for society. The aim of the BR act or Battle Royale is to take
a class of students, in this case 41 Ninth graders and set them on a
deserted island with a map, rations and a randomly packed weapon to
duke it out to the death. One can only remain after the 3 day
tournament&#133;or none at all. This wicked dark comedy has its tongue so
firmly planted in cheek that it draws some serious blood. All the
90210-esqe cliques are here: the loners, the populars, the geeks and so
on, they align themselves and try their best to stay alive or thwart
the system. This movie rocks, plain and simple. It moves fast and there
are plenty of evil laughs and grins to be had by all the violent
happenings. It's a real pity that a distributor for the US couldn't be
found. But I guess that's why man invented the all-region DVD player.
