It&#x27;s been a while since I saw &#x22;Super Heroic Trio&#x22; that made me numb and
squirm (well I saw it when I was only 10 or 11) and this movie is
another chance that made me feel that way, well a little lesser than
the previous one. At first I thought the storyline and plot of Battle
Royale was cheap, unconvincing and simply a product of bad casting, but
I sit back, relaxed and watch the movie and attempt for a review
myself. It turned pretty cool! I never thought this movie was full of
story, misery, coolness and chilling creativeness. Imagine your country
rankled by cruel, ironclad law passed forth for disciplinary cause. The
Japanese actors were surreal their acting, well sometimes I judge it
myself a little too rancid, but they&#x27;ve pulled of well the play and
their role budge in coolly. This is the second time I saw Tatsuya
Fujiwara on screen and I was even surprised that the strong, fierce,
independent girl named Takako Chigusa was actually Chiaki Kuriyama,
whom I first saw in Quentin&#x27;s renowned Kill Bill. The dimension of each
characters were fine, streamlined shortly, and even though their
characters in the story were only short-lived I must say they&#x27;ve
effectively strut their character well on screen. They&#x27;ve conveyed well
the situation if one is faced with eminent dilemma that will surely
shock your senses and spirit. They were just high school students, here
comes the vindictive law enforcing strictly its mechanics and system,
and they have no choice but to fight for their lives. One thing or
another, they&#x27;ve really portrayed well their reactions though still
stormed by their childhood memories and struggles. I loved the drama
and action. Speaking of action it was, how do I put it, innocently
superb! For their young age role they know how to wield convincingly
weapons given to them, and it&#x27;s a plus point for this movie on how
they&#x27;ve successfully pulled that stunt. The message was fine, live and
move forward, all in all they&#x27;ve wrapped everything brilliantly.
