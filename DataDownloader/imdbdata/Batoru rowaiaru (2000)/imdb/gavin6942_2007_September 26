In the future of Japan, there is a crisis in the world of education. To
see who may continue on, the government passes the Battle Royale Act.
Forty-two students are kidnapped and brought to a remote island, given
random weapons and forced to kill each other. The one remaining kid is
able to go home alive. If more than one is alive at the end of the time
on the island, everyone is executed and there is no winner.<br /><br />For those of us in America who don&#39;t catch a lot of Asian films,
perhaps the only face you&#39;ll recognize is that of Chiaki Kuriyama, who
plays Takako Chigusa (Girl #13). You may recall her from &quot;Kill Bill&quot; as
Go-Go Yubari, the girl with the mace working with the Crazy 88. The
others, apart from Takeshi, are likely completely unrecognizable. But,
there&#39;s something about this that adds to the whole scenario -- it&#39;s
hard to pick favorites when the actors are unknown.<br /><br />I watched this as a horror film, but it&#39;s not purely a horror film.
Sure, it has gore and kids getting hunted down by other kids. It has
some connections to &quot;survival horror&quot;, but it&#39;s more of an
action-thriller. However, this doesn&#39;t take away from the film at all
-- it adds to it. The first time I saw the movie, I was in bed and
constantly kept jumping up, swinging my fist and yelling &quot;(expletive)
yeah!&quot; Maybe that&#39;s a little silly, but I couldn&#39;t contain my
excitement for this non-stop action piece.<br /><br />Heads explode, kids get shot, there&#39;s jumps to the death. When you have
42 kids and only one can survive, you get a lot of guns, knives and
other weapons (even poison) to get the action moving. So much more
interesting than your average action film with nothing more than guns
blazing (sorry, Bruce Willis).<br /><br />And there&#39;s some wild cards. A guy who has survived a previous Battle
Royale is thrown in the mix. Another man who is obviously unhinged (a
&quot;transfer student&quot;) dresses like an Asian Heath Ledger and just goes
balls out with whole sale slaughter. I didn&#39;t want to cheer him on --
he&#39;s the villain -- but I couldn&#39;t help myself.<br /><br />I can&#39;t recall everything right now because I&#39;ve been drinking heavily.
But I will tell you this is the most excited I&#39;ve been during a film in
as long as I can remember. The last time I was excited about anything
(movie or not) was in December 2003 during a bad episode of Conan
O&#39;Brien where they compared Saddam Hussein to Santa Claus. Seriously,
if you see only one foreign action/horror film this year, make it
&quot;Battle Royale&quot;. This blows &quot;Ju-On&quot; and &quot;Pulse&quot; and &quot;Ringu&quot; out of the
water for sheer intensity. Possibly the best Asian film ever made.
