One IMDb user commented that Hollywood would never be able to produce a
movie of this nature. Take one look at Condemned and Mean Guns and
you&#39;ll know why. Battle Royale&#39;s Hollywood counterparts (if they are
even deserving of that title) betray Battle Royale&#39;s fundamental
premise. While the aforementioned maroon assassins and criminals on the
island, Battle Royale sees school children unwillingly thrust into a
situation of betrayal, fear and imminent doom. It is only through the
medium of innocence that the audience can fully realise the horror of
BR.<br /><br />I guarantee you at least one hunter flashback (a revision of playground
tag). Who&#39;s in (the game as players) and who can you trust? <br /><br />My only advice is to pay attention to names, (it makes the movie that
much more poignant) my only qualm is that BR is at times melodramatic
and my only strategy for hunter: grab your best mate; run from anyone
else.
