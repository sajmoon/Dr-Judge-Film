This film is incredibly crafted. I've never seen something with such
shocking material. The black humor, violence, music, the codes of honor
and friendship, it's just hard to look away from the screen. Kinji
Fukasaku was truly gifted and I am so happy he made this film before he
died, it's a great way to end a career. I won't try to analyze the film
or anything, but if you can stomach the gore etc., then you should
definitely try to find a copy. If you like the film then go on and
check out his earlier stuff, like the Yakuza Papers. It almost appears
that he's been practicing his whole life and then went out with a bang
making a film which broke every Japanese Box office record.
