BATTLE ROYALE is one of the all-time great classics of the Asian
action/horror genre. If you haven't seen this yet, stop reading
reviews, go to your nearest underground video store and buy this
immediately. This is a beautifully filmed and acted movie (Takeshi
Kitano is brilliant, as always), with plenty of violence and action, as
well as a truly intriguing storyline. Basically, a bunch of school kids
are put on an island and forced to kill each other until there is only
one student left. Of course the story is a lot deeper than that, but
that's all you really need to know going in to it. I was shocked and
amazed the first time I watched BATTLE ROYALE and it remains one of my
all-time favorites. I love to show this film to people who have never
seen any of the &quot;extreme&quot; Asian cinema - it turns them into instant
fans. I haven't met a person yet who doesn't love this film. My only
gripe is the ending, which I won't give away, but I will say could have
been more dark and dramatic - but it wasn't bad enough to do any real
damage to this otherwise perfect film. Go get BATTLE ROYALE immediately
- it may be one of the best things you've ever seen... Highly
recommended 9 1/2 out of 10
