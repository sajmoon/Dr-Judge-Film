2007_January 29 
I didn&#39;t really want to watch this movie, I was desperate to watch some
Japanese stylised action, but in India, I might as well hope for world
peace.<br /><br />So I checked out the foreign section of the DVD library (the most
expensive one but definitely not the best, the best ones are where the
film industry of India lives which explains all the &quot;Inspired&quot; films
I&#39;ve actually seen the master pirater Sanjay Gupta walk out of one) and
after going through the huge selection of films 40 movies no less, I
just about found 4-5 Japenese films, this one sounded the most
interesting and also the most disturbing, even though this was not what
I wanted, I ended up hiring it anyway.<br /><br />What seemed hard to digest on the back of the DVD got even more hard to
digest when the movie started, the actors looked anything but 14 the
age they were supposed to be, normally I like it when the movie offers
just passing info about the events that preceded the film (STARWAR got
me hooked to this), but I couldn&#39;t think of anything that would lead
up-to this film.<br /><br />Im not the kind that likes to apply Freudian logic to everything about
the film, but the events that shape the film are just impossible to
comprehend.<br /><br />Anyway the movie starts and the first thing you realise is that this
film is not a typical action movie, no stylised display of action here,
this movie is extremely brutal, on purpose I suspect.<br /><br />Again this movie will fluctuate through extremes of how much the human
body can take sometimes people will die if the easiest manner possible,
while others will take forever to die.<br /><br />This movie has taken the extra effort to be arty and the effort shows,
the music is classical, the action is brutal and bloody, the actors are
underage, the themes are all based on the requirement that most normal
moviegoers will not come within 20 feet of this movie, ON THEIR OWN
WILL.<br /><br />And therein lies the brilliance, make a movie with SOLID PRODUCTION
VALUES, GOOD BACKGROUND MUSIC, GOOD ACTING, GREAT CINEMATOGRAPHY AND
MAKE SURE THAT 90% OF THE THE PEOPLE ARE REPULSED BY IT AND THE CRITICS
WILL LAP IT UP.<br /><br />They will give it ratings that will go through the roof, and soon the
people who didn&#39;t want to watch the movie in the first place will also
end up watching it and then give it similar ratings.<br /><br />Im in the middle, I wanted to watch an arty Japanese film, and even
though I didn&#39;t want this I still found this movie entertaining and
thats my NO1 CRITERIA WHILE RATING A FILM. I like virtual violence and
this movie will satisfy that urge like no other.<br /><br />This movie does however also suffer from some really corny dialogues
and extremely clich&eacute;d scenes even by Hindi movie standards.<br /><br />The movie is luckily not that long and before the movie can get on your
nerves its over.<br /><br />The kill or be killed scenario is this movie gives us some really
interesting scenes and characters, such as the poisoning scene, the
rebels, the guy who enjoys it, those who go with the flow.<br /><br />The movie also has an interesting way to show why the people behaved
the way they did, the arty disjointed flashbacks have been done before
but are still a treat to watch.<br /><br />The movie has a morbid atmosphere and that has been created
brilliantly, the music the islands, the light, you can literally feel
the wet cold, the fear and frustration.<br /><br />There are a couple of humorous dialogues which were much needed and
much appreciated.<br /><br />So many factors are at play here that there&#39;s a royal battle in the
mind, which finally boils to the main point, deciding if you love it or
hate it, you wont find many in the bracket between 3 and 7 like me.<br /><br />In all we have a decent foreign language film that will basically
satisfy only a narrow audience but be rated highly by all, possible
types are LOVERS OF VIOLENCE, LOVERS OF ART HOUSE FILMS, THOSE WHO
APPLY FREUDIAN LOGIC TO FILM ETC.<br /><br />Rent only if your in the mood for such entertainment though as this is
Definitely NOT EASY VIEWING, keep in mind what your getting into and
the fact that this is not as good as the critics want you believe.<br /><br />-s very hard to digest, not easy viewing, over-hyped,extra effort to do
things differently shows, even then there are loads of clich&eacute;d scenes.<br /><br />+/-s no explanations for lots of events including those that lead to
the film.<br /><br />+s excellent production values including soundtrack, cinematography
etc, good acting,hard hitting violence, some brilliant scenes, good
humour too.<br /><br />total 7-7.5/10 (factoring in expectations on absolute terms this movie
is not as good for a lover of R rated commercial cinema like me)
